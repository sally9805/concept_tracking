" Mister , " Mary called . " Look by the cooking pots yonder . We were there cutting arrowleaf yesterday . Like as not it 's right there on the ground . " " Ah , je me souviens , " he muttered , and went toward the kettles . Goulart went back to his walnuts . Mrs. Stumf was trying to go , as unobtrusively as her big form would allow , toward her bedding . She moved with such exaggerated stealth that anyone seeing her would have known she was up to something devious , so Mary went to distract Goulart 's attention . He looked up suddenly when he saw the elusive object of his desires approaching him . She smiled . " For a favor , " she said , holding out the tomahawk he had given her for blazing trees . " This is dull . It don ' cut very well . But it 's a good head f'r crackin ' walnuts . What say y ' to trade f'r the day ? Why , maybe y ' could sharpen this'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a nice favor . " She tried to keep her voice pleasant but natural and not to glance at Ghetel . Inside she was quaking . A cocky smile slowly established itself on Goulart 's face , which had been sullen ever since he had awakened this morning to find Mary gone from his side . Obviously he now thought Mary was just being a coquette . " But of course , there Madame ! " he said gallantly , and gave her his tomahawk and took hers . " Oh , thankee . Try that one on a walnut . . . it 's nice and heavyAs he bent to place a walnut , Mary saw Ghetel sneaking toward the cookpots . The old woman dropped the knife on the ash-covered ground , stepped back and then walked about stooping as if searching the ground . " Here , M'shoo ! " Ghetel bellowed gaily , and when LaPlante looked her way she stooped and picked the knife up from where she had dropped it and held it up for him . He broke into smiles and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinuses . Mary 's heartbeat slowed and she had to hold her breath to keep from sighing out loud . That was enough . She had a feeling that if they did not leave immediately , something else like this was going to come up and prevent them . " Mrs. Stumf , " she said cheerfully , hoping not too cheerfully , " what say y ' to goin ' after that hickory grove we seen yonder . .. " She pointed southward . " . . . and I saw lots of sassa/fras . Mr. Goulart gim me a tommyhock sharp enough to cut sassafras root with ! " " ' Eyyy ! Gut ! " Ghetel exclaimed , perhaps a little too eagerly . " Well , then , let 's be about it , " Mary said . Her voice sounded strained and unnatural to her ; her heartbeat seemed to be forcing all the air out of her lungs , and she hoped the Indians and Frenchmen would not notice the strain in her voice ; surely they would sense that something was happening . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sling it over her shoulder . Ghetel did the same . LaPlante and Goulart were still whacking away at walnuts , and most of the Indian men were playing their game or maintaining their guns . Now , Mary thought . Just turn your back on it and go . Do n't go look at the baby ; y 'll get all upset and they 'll suspect something . Do n't look at the baby ! But she went to look at the baby . There was no such thing as not going to look at the baby . Fortunately , it was asleep . Its eyes were shut . Otter Girl sat beside it mending a moccasin , chewing the leather to soften it until she could ease the point of a bone needle into it and draw a rawhide thong through . She looked up , a smile of utter contentment on her round , bronze face . Mary knelt by the infant , her back to the Otter Girl . She lowered her face as close as she could without touching the baby and awakening it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell and suddenly her heart clenched mightily and the baby 's dark little eyelashes and tiny features blurred beyond a flood of tears and Mary 's arms ached to grab up the little living bundle and run with it , run all the way back to Draper 's Meadows without stopping . Her hot tears were dropping on the baby 's forehead and would awaken it ; little frowns were disturbing its face and its little beak of an upper lip sucked in the soft red lower lip . Mary could n't stop herself . She kissed the little mouth and then , with anguish that surely would kill her , she rose to her feet and stumbled , tearblinded , to the edge of the camp , her lungs quaking for release , her throat clamped to hold down the awful wail of despair that was trying to erupt . The old woman , who was the only one in the camp to see her livid , contorted face , was so stricken by its agony that she too had to force back a wail of misery . Oh dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loins had feltp152when the baby was being born . But ten times worse . Ten times ten times ten times worse . Oh dear God help me ! HELP ME ! HELP ME ! They were far into the woods before she could see or hear or feel anything , and what she became aware of first was the old woman 's strong arm across her back helping her along , all but carrying her . She stopped her on a slope covered with tan dead leaves among gigantic beech and poplar trunks . She knelt and pulled her down and muffled her face with her blanket and started patting her back . " Now , " she said . " Dey can not hear you now . Cry up ! Do it ! " It was an hour before Mary could get up and go on . She was empty and weak , even as bad as she had been on the day when they had taken Tommy and Georgie away from her . She stood leaning against Ghetel , who was still patting her lightly on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " Mary strangled . " Who could ? " the old woman replied . " We could still go back . " " No . Do n't even say it . " They wandered in no particular direction at first , barking trees with the tomahawk to leave a confusing trail . Then they came to a small clear brook and stepped into it barefoot , carrying their shoes , and went westward toward the O-y-o . The water was very cold . After a mile the brook wandered into the salt valley and emptied into the salt creek , some distance below the camp . They waded to its other shore , dresses pulled up waist-high , then walked in the odorous muck at the creek 's edge , the creek water dissolving their footprints as they stepped out of them . The sunlight was pale and the air had a chilly edge . Most of the foliage on the slopes nearby was still green , but a dry , yellowing green , and here and there were boughs and crowns of red and purple foliage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , ablaze with mirrored afternoon sunlight . The creek deepened and they had to climb out onto its bank to make the last hundred yards to the river . They stood and looked at it for a moment only . Its damp flowed around them on a breeze . " So now ? " Ghetel whispered . Mary looked up the east bank of the O-y-o and dipped her head . Her sight was still fuzzy with tears and her eyes were red . She felt asp153if the first step would take the little strength left in her . " Along here , " she said . " For a long , long way . " She sighed , stooped to put on her shoes , then picked up the blanket and tomahawk and they started walking through the reeds and shrubbery , watching a few paces ahead for snakes . Long blades of grass whispered around their ragged skirts and slashed at their bare shins . The reflected sunlight from the river was hot on the left sides of their faces . Huge dragonflieshovered and drifted away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river breeze alongsidetheir way . Birds rose , dipped , shrilled , skimmed close over the water . Mary looked at them now and then and gradually began to think of freedom . Through the deep lonely misery of her soul the thought came to her that for the first time in more than two months she was not a captive of the Indians  --  not a slave . Her legs overcame their heavy reluctance and began to like this walking . She heard the old woman 's heavy breathing and crashing , thumpingfootsteps behind her , and an occasional Dutchy oath . " Step light , Ghetel . We must go far as we can afore night . " Mary felt a curious , soaring sensation in her breast as she said this . It was a feeling strangely like happiness . She was on her way to Will . Just before sunset a towering line of grim clouds crawled up from the southwest . Thunder grumbled , lightning flickered on the horizon , and as the clouds climbed , a blast of damp air shivered the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white side up . Soon the thunderheads dominated the whole sky above the river ; they came gliding across , their undersides lowering and dragging gray veils of rain under them . Birds and insects fell silent . In the moment of stillness as the rainfall came sweeping toward them across the river , Mary heard , or rather , felt , the stroke of a distant gunshot on the charged air . She stopped and raised a hand , and Ghetel almost blundered over her . They stood and listened for a moment , and she thought she detected another , then another , and one or two that were dubious because they were lost in the mutteringof thunder . " Eh ? " Ghetel queried.  | " Do n't rightly know , " Mary said . The reports had seemed to come from the direction of the camp . " Not hunting , surely , afore a storm like now . " Were they killing the baby ? Not likely with a lot of gunshots , she decided . " No , I 'd reckon they think we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back . " It seemed the best explanation , and Mary smiled with a cunning satisfaction . And then the sting of blown rain peppered them and hissed up the shore and into the trees . " Ach ! Nab ! " Ghetel complained . " No , it 's good , " Mary exclaimed . " Come . With this , we 'll leave no trail f'r ' em to pick up come morning ! They 'll just think a bear got us , or lightnin ' or sump'n , an ' wo n't even try t ' find us , I 'll wager ! " She was almost running now , feeling free , and cleansed of the degradation of her bondage by this pelting torrent . She could hear Ghetel huffing and slogging along behind her , muttering : " Bears ? Lightnink ? Ach ! " The forest and river turned white and the sky cracked open along a tortuous blue-white seam for an instant ; a tree flashed and exploded a few yards ahead and a bolt of noise felled Mary to her knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell came through the air . Mary got to her feet again as the echoes of the bolt dwindled across the river . " Lightnink will ! " the old woman wailed . They were drenched by the time the rain had passed and the thunder bumped away in the east . It was too dark by then to continue safely along the unknown terrain of the shore . The wool of their blankets was heavy with water , and their sodden dresses hung cold on their skin . Mary estimated they had come perhaps five miles since reaching the river . Now that they had stopped in the dripping , dribbling gloom , the warmth of their exertions evaporated at once and their empty stomachs gave them no warmth . Mary remembered then that in the anxiety of the morning they had eaten nothing . It promised to be a grim and shivery night , and despite their exhaustionthey likely would get no sleep at all . They peered and groped until they found a level and relatively well-drained place under a natural bower , where the old leaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twisted their blankets between them to squeeze out the water , then drapedp155the blankets over themselves and squatted beside each other for a moment . Mary 's teeth chattered and she trembled from end to end . Even the primitive salt camp seemed cozy and luxurious compared with this . " We 've a hard night ahead , I fear . I 'm sorry . We 'll do as best we can , eh ? Come daybreak we 'll find us some nuts or pawpawsor sump'n , eh ? " " Take , " Ghetel said . " Eh ? " The old woman reached for Mary 's hand and put something cold and mushy in it . She explained , " It vaz bread , til the rain . I get it before we leaf . " They ate the pasty mass . Mary could taste hickory nuts and acorn meal in it with the corn . It was delicious . She licked her fingers and felt a degree warmer inside . They shook and trembled in their wet blankets for an hour , listening to the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crickets and each other 's sighs . Mary was so wretched she could hardly even think of the absence of her baby . " May-ry , " the old woman croaked . " Aye ? " " Come . " And when they lay body to body , even the damp blankets could not entirely douse the warmth they gave each other , and eventually they slept through a night they had expected to be sleepless.  |p156SOMETHING  was happening . Mary was jolted out of sleep by her own heartbeat , by the sound of rustling in the leaves mere inches from her head . The old widow was moving , rising , cautiously , lifting the blanket . Mary opened her eyes in the green dimness and groped for the tomahawk . But before she could gather herself to move , Ghetel surged behind her , grunted , dragged the blanket off and scrambled in the leafy thicket . Something scurried away through rustling leaves and the old woman expelled a breathy oath . Heart walloping , Mary turned to see the widow on all fours , staring into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet . Mary had to swallow her heart before she could ask what had happened . " Almost got a meat for breakfast , " sighed the old woman . " Almost in mine hands ! Ach , for a gun ! " " We 'd dare not shoot one if we had it . What kind of animal ? " They were both kneeling on the bottom blanket and the old woman was extricating herself from the clinging grasp of the other . She did not know what the animal was called , she said , but her efforts to describe it convinced Mary that she had nearly grabbed either a raccoon or a badger , which had been sniffing curiously at them while they slept . " Then y ' ought to thank heaven it got away , " Mary exclaimed . " Such beasties as them would ' a ' thawed y'r arm up ' fore I could ' a ' put the tommyhawk on ' im ! I swear , Ghetel , that appetitieo ' your'n will be the death of us !  |p157Ghetel  seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had escaped her clutches . " But I do like breakfast , " she growled as they moved out of the thicket to the river bank , their blankets draped over their shoulders like capes . They eventually did find a breakfast . Veering straight north inlandto save distance at a place where the river elbowed , they found not only a good fall of hickory nuts , but a pair of paw-paw trees , small but heavily laden . They shook down all the firm yellow-green fruits they could dislodge , and bound them up in a blanket to bring along . On the ground under the trees they found a dozen that had fallen and turned brown with ripeness and gave up a heavy , sweet smell . They opened these eagerly and dredged out the soft , sweet yellow pulp with their fingers , moaning with pleasure as they worked it over their tongues and sucked it off the big brown seeds and swallowed it . In a few minutes they were full and sticky , and permeated with the cloying odor of the stuff . They washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to regain the bank of the O-y-o , bringing the paw-paw aroma with them . The day was overcast and the ground remained soft from the night 's rain . Mary looked over her shoulder constantly as they moved along . Even though she was certain the rain had destroyed their traces near the camp , she knew they were leaving a spoor that would be easy to follow if the Indians had chanced onto it this morning . They rested on a stone ledge at the riverside early in the afternoon , breaking and munching hickory nuts . Mary 's breasts ached for the baby 's lips , and to keep from thinking about it , she talked optimistically about their progress , and about their wisdom in leavingthe salt camp . " We 'd not ha ' got away from the Shawnee town , " she mused aloud . " All those people . And dogs . No dogs at the salt camp , thanks be t ' God . " But the best o n't is , we 're on th ' right side o ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ' crossed it , short of stealin ' a canoe . And I f'r one deem the heathens handier at stealin ' than bein ' stole from . " Late that afternoon as they labored eastward along the bank of the O-y-o , Mary recognized on the opposite shore the mouth of the river that Goulart had called . . . she searched her memory for the Frenchp158word , but remembered only that it meant " the stony river " and that the Indians called it the Miami-zuh . She recalled that they had passed it in the afternoon of their last day coming down , and thus reckoned that she and Ghetel had walked some fifteen or twenty miles up the O-y-o valley in this first full day of their liberation . Fifteen or twenty miles , she thought . It sounded good ; they had done well indeed . But then she remembered all the days of coming down on horseback from Draper 's Meadows  --  the month of days  --  when they had made perhaps fifteen or twenty miles a day mounted , and then the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt creek ; and suddenly the distance they had struggled today seemed but a tiny first step on the long way home . Why , they would have to walk this far every day for a month and a half or two months to get home ! And this O-y-o valley , strenuous though it was , was gentle by comparison with the terrain they would meet along the New River through the Alleghenies . But come now , she told herself . Y 'll do no good thinkin ' discouragementso ' this sort ! A day is a day , and y 'll take each as it comes . If't requires two months o ' days , that 's little enough t ' trade f'r a lifetime back among y'r own ! They were famished by nightfall , and ate three more of the pawpawsapiece . Their blankets had dried during the day , and the evening was mild , so they did not have to huddle together for warmth . Each rolled up in her own blanket  --  redolent of paw-paw now , almost sickeningly so  --  and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hushing , owl-hooting darkness above the murmuringriver , letting the burning aches in her legs and back subside into an aching torpor of the- flesh , then into numbness , and slid off into a sleep haunted by space and uncertainty . They foraged for almost an hour the next morning , staying within sight of the river , but found nothing they recognized as edible . They had several pounds of paw-paws left , but by now their senses were so permeated by their over-sweet odor that the thought of eating one was nauseating . Ghetel wanted to range further inland , up the slopes into high ground where nut trees might be found , and Mary had to persuade her that their primary purpose was to cover distancep159upriver . Ghetel came along , a bit grimly ; evidently she had meant it when she said she appreciated breakfast . They slogged along through brushy bottomlands , wading small creeks and marshes , climbing slopes on all fours , struggling through brambles that ripped their tattered skirts and drew blood from their legs ; by early afternoon they were gasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fierce as bee-stings , and were so famished that the paw-paws were delectable again . And suddenly , after perhaps twelve miles , they emerged from a densely wooded downslope to find their way blocked by the mouth of a river that flowed into the O-y-o . Mary remembered this one . The word for buffalo . This was the river Goulart had pointed out to her as the Buffalo River . It was far too wide and apparently too deep to try to cross here . Ghetel 's face drooped in dismay and she sat down abruptly on the ground in a slumping posture of defeat , sweat dripping off the end of her shapeless nose . Mary looked at her and knew how she felt . But she had , of course , already considered such detours as this . " Eh , well , " she said with a wan and unconvincing smile , and pointed up the bank of the tributary with her tomahawk , " let 's us jus ' stroll up this side a stretch till we find a fordin ' place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Mary feared that if she sat there musing on it too long , she might consider turning back to the relative comfort and security of the salt camp . So she grabbed her hand and , with false gaiety , tugged at her until the old woman sighed and got to her feet . Mary sang softly as they went along : 0 ten times teen times ten a  --  way , But I 'll be ho  --  ome a  --  gain . But they spent the rest of that evening and all the next day going up the shore of the tributary , farther and farther from their guidewaythe O-y-o . It was depressing in the extreme to be struggling five , ten , maybe twenty miles , for all they knew , only for the purpose of returning to a point a stone 's throw away from where they had stood . It was almost as disheartening as going backwards . Butthere was nothing for it but to do this ; neither of them could swim . They were exhausted , hungry , scratched and bruised when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they came to a riffle that indicated a shallows . The branches of trees almost met over the river here , producing such a deep green gloom that they were unwilling to try a crossing before the next morning  --  especially in their spent condition . They piled leaves between two parallel fallen logs and spread their blankets . They went down to the river 's edge and forced themselves to eat the rest of their paw-paws , which by now were so ripe and familiar as to be almost revolting . And the steady diet of paw-paws and more paw-paws and nothing else had given them both a severe flux . Ghetel got up and stepped a few feet away , squatted with the hem of her skirt drawn up around her waist and discharged her bowels into the leaves with a loud gushing , spurting noise and came back with a distasteful expression on her face . A few minutes later Mary felt the call and went away to do the same . She did not like this . It was her experience that the flux had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could maintain . Something with heavy footsteps and deep wet breathing snuffled and grunted around them for almost an hour after midnight , waking them and then leaving them in such a state of fright that they did not sleep again until almost dawn . They were sure it was a bear , and sat up , back to back , Mary gripping the tomahawk , ready to defend themselves blindly in the darkness . When Mary heard Ghetel snore , she at last gave in to her own weariness and they both dozed sitting up until they were awakened by the shrilling of some woodland bird and glimpsed a pearly-coral dawn showing through the trees on the other side of the river . They wanted some strength for their attempt to ford the river , and so occupied themselves with searching for food until the light strengthened , pausing often to spew the scalding , fluid contents of their bowels onto the ground . The memory of their helpless fright during the long night caused Mary to think she should try to fashion some sort of weapons for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow-straight saplings , about two inches in diameter at their bases , cut them down with the tomahawk , shaved off the bark , cut them to lengths of about seven feet and then whittled their heavy ends to spear sharpness . This arming somehow heartened them for the crossing of the river.  |p161Mary  led the way into the cold , swift water , feeling the slick , rounded stones with her bare feet , probing ahead for depth and bracing herself against the current with the blunt end of her hickory spear , while the old woman clung desperately to the back of her dress and gasped and mumbled , prayers probably , in her language . With every additional inch of depth they reached , her toes ' traction on the slippery stones became more tenuous , and the certainty that they would be simply carried off their feet and swept into the relentless stream to drown became more definite , more dizzying . The river , which she had estimated at fifty feet wide , now seemed as broad as the O-y-o . The flow was generally only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression and feel the current tugging at her hips and waist , the end of the whole ordeal would seem to lie inches away in the watery void at her left . She seemed to have been looking at the same exposed roots on the far bank for hours when they suddenly were there in her hand and then she was scrambling up the bank with river water dribbling out of her skirt .  --  ' Ahhhhh HEEE ! " Ghetel roared with joyous relief . Unseen animals went rustling away across the leafy floor of the woods . They had made it . They were exhausted , trembling violently , but exultant . They hugged , pounding each other on the back and laughing almost hysterically in their triumph . They subsided eventually , and paused to wring out their skirts and the ends of their blankets , sighing and shuddering . Mary took note of her belt then , and decided she should keep a calendar of the days of their return , as she had of her descent . She counted back . This was the fifth day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied a triple knot to mark the beginning of their trek and then four more , single knots . Ghetel , meanwhile , was expressing her familiar concern : " Hungry , " she said . " I need a breakfast . " So they made a brief excursion up the slopes to look for food , being careful to keep the river in view . Mary was anxious to get back down the east bank of this river and rejoin the O-y-o . She was worried about being out of sight of it . High on the slope , where an old burn-over was covered with scrub and second-growth timber , they found a profusion of wild grape vines clinging to the small trees as if trying to haul them down and strangle them . The grapes were small , hardly bigger thanp162peas , but were in such dense bunches that it was only a few minutes ' work to fill a blanket with them and tie up its corners . Then they picked more and sat on the ground nibbling the powerfully bittersweetgrapes off their stems . They chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Thus filled , but left strangely half-satisfied for lack of bread or meat , they scrambled back down the slope to the river bottom and followed it northward toward the O-y-o . At midday , the weather close and overcast , when they were perhaps a fourth of the way back down the shore of the tributary , they were dismayed to find still another obstacle before them : a deep , wide creek flowing across their path into the river . Mary sighed . They would have to make a detour from their detour . This was worse even than she had suspected . They had been fugitive for five days now and , though they probably had walked sixty or seventymiles , they had progressed no more than thirty miles toward home , because of these necessary digressions from their route . In truth , she thought , because of these damnable side-trips , we 're probably further from home now than when we escaped ! But no . Looking at it that way will only drive you mad . This unexpected creek had added five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made their way up its south bank , crossed it on a fallen ash tree that had bridged it and then hiked and crawled back down its north shore to rejoin the Buffalo River . And thus by nightfall they still had not raised sight of the O-y-o . It was midmorningof their sixth day of freedom before they stood , weary and weakened by their flux , on the banks of the O-y-o again , now above the mouth of the Buffalo River . These last two and a half days , Mary thought , have brought us a hundred yards closer to home . It was so grimly absurd it was almost like a joke . But it was a joke she decided not to tell to Ghetel . The old woman was having enough trouble keeping heart as it was . " Eh , now ! " Mary exclaimed with a dreadful false jollity . " That wee diversion 's done with . Now we 've an easy road ahead f'r a good spell ! "  | ALONG a ridge crest deep in the Tennessee country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among dark pine trees . On the lead horse was the half-breed guide , Gander Jack , who was now dressed in the Indian mode . Gander Jack spoke English and Cherokee and frequently in his forty-one years had passed between Roanoke and the Cherokee towns south of the Cumberland . He was one of the few men who knew the way to the towns of the Southern Nations , and so had been hired as a guide at considerable expense by Will Ingles , who rode on the horse immediately behind him . Johnny Draper was on the third horse , leading a pack horse that carried their provisions and several pounds of mirrors , glass beads , combs and small tools to be used as gifts and ransom . Gander jack had suggested they bring rum , but Will had been opposed to it  --  first because he suspected it was prompted by Jack 's own considerablethirst , and second because he did not believe that rum was conducive to levelheaded dealings with Indians . At length , though , Will had conceded and brought a few gallons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the ridge and began to descend through a copse of junipers , emerging then on a clear slope overlooking a vast and brilliant stand of mountain ash : a profusion of small yellow leaves and stark red berries . Cedar waxwings , bluejays and finches shot to and fro among the ashes , feasting on the berries . On thep164distant slopes , forests of dark evergreens stood among the fading hardwoods , while shadows of clouds slid slowly up the valleys . The riders converged with a narrow mountain stream about halfwaydown the slope , a gushing , roaring , leaping watercourse among boulders . The descent was so steep that the horses all but slid down on their rumps . In half an hour then they rode out onto a gentle , U-shaped valley full of dry grass and pine growing in reddish earth . Here they could ride abreast . They went at a trot for an hour , their eyes shaded by their wide , three-cornered hats . Gander Jack wore a yellow bandana circled around his head . His hat hung behind his shoulder on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haze of smoke hanging along a wall of dark pines a mile ahead . " Cherokee town there , " Jack said . He reined in his horse ; Will and John did the same , though uncertain why . After a full minute of listening and watching , Jack clucked his tongue and they moved forward again , but at a slow walk . Will had broken out in a sweat in the still heat and ominous quiet . And suddenly , in the corners of his eyes , he detected the movement of figures . Glancing about , ' his hand tensing involuntarilyon the rifle that lay across his saddle , he saw that they were flanked by perhaps a dozen warriors on foot , some of them armed with bows and hide shields , others with guns . These were escorting them toward the town . It was eerie how they had materialized out here on this open space . They rode in among pines and the smell of woodsmoke , and found themselves suddenly within a clean , orderly village of remarkablysubstantial log houses , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , roofed with split wood . Stick-and-clay chimneys showed that the dwellings even had fireplaces . Handsome , brown-skinned young women , naked from the waist up , working at grain mortars and kettles and looms in the pleasant shade alongside the road , paused and stood up to watch these white men ride in . Children wearing not a stitch paused in their play and looked in awe at what Will presumed were the first white men they had ever seen . A clear stream curved in toward the heart of the town , and it was full of naked children and women washing . Will was impressed by the air of peace and order . He turned to look aside at Johnny , who caught his eye at once and remarked :  | " Nice town , ai n't it ? " Looking back , Will saw now that much of the population had moved in behind them , following quietly and watching with great curiosity . " Chief , " Gander Jack said softly , and Will turned to see a wellformedold man with grizzled hair coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking staff with white and yellow feathers at its tip . Jack raised his hand to him and reined in . The chief returned the salute , and Jack dismounted , stood before him and offered his hand . They clasped forearms and Jack began talking . The chief nodded , his quick eyes occasionally darting up to look at the white men . " Get down , " Jack said . " He do n't like you a-lookin ' down on ' im . " They slid off , eager to please . Will and Johnny and Gander Jack went into the lodge , a spacious and cool structure with a high ceiling , and there they smoked a pipe with the chief and some leading men of the town . They ate a meal from a large bowl containing beans and squash flavored with strips of a meat they could not identify by taste . Gander Jack was canny enough to wait until they had finished before telling them it was dog . Will felt a twinge of nausea , then put it out of his mind and forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He listened as Will described , with Jack translating , the massacre at Draper 's Meadows and told of his hope that the hostages might be located in the Shawnee country and ransomed through the offices of the neutral Cherokees . He told of the gifts of great beauty that he could bestow upon both the Shawnees and the Cherokees if his beloved family were returned to him . The chief listened to all this with his eyes hooded , and if his soul was stirred at all by the mention of the presents , he did not show it . He spoke quickly to Gander Jack and then stood up . " He 's never had a chance to talk directly to Englishmen , " Gander Jack said . " He has a few things on his mind and wants you to listen . ' Johnny leaned close to Will , smiling with half his mouth . " What say y ' , Will ? Shall we hear ' im out ? " " Ca n't say as I 've got anything more pressing t'do . Tell him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem ourselves lucky to share his wisdom . " Gander Jack let the chief get a few seconds ' head start talking , then stepped in at his first pause for breath and began translating : " He says he 's seen his cousins the Shawnees two times this year . . . and they 've told him what 's in their hearts .. . " The Shawnees took up the tomahawk against the English white men because they 've been drove from place to place by ' em . They used to live a good life but had to move away north to strange places when the English white men came close and made big farms and killed all the game . . . " Then they had to move west and find new lands , on the O-y-o , because more white English came . . . " He says he understands the hearts o ' the Shawnees . . . that he himself got wary when he saw your white faces come today . . . He fears that the Cherokee nation may one day have to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afore ' em . . . " He says the Shawnees wo n't give up their captives easy . He wants you to understand that they take captives and adopt them into their families to replace people who been killed or died because of the white men coming . .. " " Ask him if that means they 're likely alive , " said Will . Jack exchanged words with the chief , then told Will : " That 's up to the families . They 're given a captive to replace someone they 've lost . If their anger 's too strong , they might torture or kill that prisoner to have revenge . But if they believe that person is of good blood , they 'll adopt him , or her , and give the same comfort and protection they gave their own . " Will and Johnny traded anxious glances . Then Will extended another question that had been bothering him . " Ask him why the Shawnee , if they hate white men so dang much , hire on with the French . They 're just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumped for a second by that question . " He says , " replied Jack , " that the French are different from you . They hunt and trap and fish , just like the Shawnee , and they make small villages like the Indians , and farm only for food to eat themselves . . . He says they do n't try to drive the red man out and destroy his land and kill all the game . He says the French and the Indians canp167live side by side in a land and help each other . But not so with the English white men , and that 's why the Shawnees use the help o ' the French . . . " At this point the chief sat down . A buck , at a signal , brought forth the pipe again , with coals to light it , and it was passed around . Then the chief began talking again , this time with a less pontifical demeanor . " He says he 's glad you come to see him . He thinks y 're brave to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , love their families , and would do as you do . . . He says he 'd like to help you ransom your families , and he 'll say good words for you to any Shawnees who come here . But he says it ai n't likely any will . Wait . . . " The chief talked again , and waved toward the southwest . " He tells me there was a Cherokee named Snake Stick , from a village out yonder , came through here two days back , an ' this ' ere Snake Stick told him he was going up to talk with the Shawnees afore winter . He says if Snake Stick ai n't gone yet , y ' might hire him as y'r go-between . " Will 's eyes blazed with eagerness . " How far to this Snake Stick feller ? " " I know where his town is . Five days south an ' west , barrin ' floods or trouble . " Will pondered that a moment . They had ridden two weeks already into this strange country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five days deeper into the Cherokee lands would be risky indeed . He turned and glanced at Johnny . " It 's f'r Bettie an ' Mary an ' them , " Johnny said . " I ca n't go back knowin ' I had n't done all I could . " " Nor me . " He turned back to their guide . " Will y ' take us there , Jack ? " The half-breed shrugged , a sickly smile on his face . " I take it that means f'r a price , " Will said . The half-breed nodded . Then the Cherokee chief spoke again . Jack translated : " He says y ' oughter know that Snake Stick might not be inclined to do anythin ' for a white English . He thinks like a Shawnee , talks like a Shawnee . His heart ai n't ' xactly neutral . He goes up t ' visitp168the Shawnee an ' listens to ' em t ' git his blood all hot . Th ' chief warns us we oughter know that . " Will Ingles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief , thinking . Finally he said : " I reckon this ' ere Snake Stick 's like any other man . Like as not he 'd do fr us  --  f'r a price . Thank our chief here . Tell ' im I have some gifts for ' im , in pay f'r his hospitality . Then we 'll be a-gettin ' on , to go see this Snake Stick . " Gander Jack thought it would be a good idea to give the Cherokee chief and his friends some whiskey in return for their opinions and advice , but Will refused , knowing it was Jack 's own thirst that had prompted the suggestion . " And do n't you by God tell ' em we 've got any , either , " Will warned him . " This evenin 's goin ' smooth . No need to waste good liquor makin ' good Cherokees bad . Now hear me , Jack : I 'm a-sleepin ' with these jugs , and with my gun , and if I wake up hearin ' one squeak of a jug-stopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Nobody came into the hut that night to steal whiskey , but Will might as well have been standing sentry duty ; sleep just would not come , even though he was bone-weary and the pallet was far softer and drier than anything he had slept on for weeks . It might have been the sounds that kept him awake ; it might have been the smells . Now and then he would hear sounds of soft movement go past the hut , like moccasins on soft earth , like legging brushing against legging . When he heard something like this , he would stare at the oblong patch of lesser dark that was the doorway of the hut and would put his thumb on the cold flintlock hammer of the rifle , which lay across his waist . He would stare at that blackgrayoblong until it swam ; then he would look a little way above it , realizing that he could see it more clearly in the edge of his vision . A child coughing in its sleep somewhere in a nearby shelter made Will jump in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact was , though Johnny Draper and Gander Jack had seen not a hint of it , that Will Ingles was scared halfway to death . It had been getting worse night by night during their long ride into the Cherokee country , but he 'd been able to put it down . Now , lying in the dark in the middle of a Cherokee town , he was almost shrieking scared . And the thought of going a week deeper into tribe country ,  |p169to  parley with a nasty young Cherokee instead of a nice old one , made it worse . One minute he 'd be thinking how scared he was now , and the next he 'd be thinking how scared he was going to be next week . Damnation , it 's awful what a man 's got to go through to keep people believin ' he 's got guts , Will thought . Nobody had ever said Will Ingles did n't have guts . There had been too much evidence over the years that he did have . Anybody could say , and many did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of man nor devil . " Well , it was true Will Ingles had guts . But there were times , like now , when it seemed the main item in those guts was a white liver . I wonder if Johnny 's scared as I am , he thought . I wonder if he 's asleep or lyin ' there havin ' the gollywobbles like me . You can see it when Gander Jack 's scared . You ca n't ever see such a thing on Johnny . Nor you ca n't on me , neither . But I am . And I bet Johnny is , too . He heard a whisper of a sound outside and his hair stood up . His eyes bulged and he raised his head and spread his ears . It had sounded something like the noise when a man half-whistles . Like a sneak-signal . Like an Indian imitating an owl , maybe . Or maybe like an owl imitating an Indian , he thought , trying to smile it away . He kept his neck craned , listening , till it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't have heard a hoot owl on his shoulder . Nothing happened . He let his head back down and stared at the invisible black ceiling , the gray of the smoke-hole in its peak , and he poured cold sweat and listened to his heart clomp around in his chest like a mule on a plank floor . It 's just from bein ' in an Indian town , he thought . A white man do n't belong in an Indian town . Nor does a white woman , he thought . He had just thought of Mary . That was why he was here . in the middle of the night in themiddle of an Indian town : because his Mary was somewhere else inthe middle of the night in the middle of an Indian town . I mean , he thought , if she 's still alive , that 's likely where she is . He lay now , trying to pick up what she would be thinking . Theyp170had used to talk fanciful about being able to hear each other 's minds and see through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been . He imagined her thoughts as hard as he could , and came eventuallyto the conclusion that she was thinking about him . What if she 's doing this same thing and she hears how scared I am , he thought . I got to stop thinkin ' scared . It would n't do her good to know . That thought reminded him of something awful : It reminded him of the day of the massacre when he had seen her in captivity and had had to run away . She may read what 's in my heart about that , he thought . If she do , how could I ever look in her face again ? Pray God , she do n't know that , he thought . But he was afraid she did . When she started thinking about what he was thinking , she usually knew . She might think I 'm a poltroon , he thought . But by God , it ai n't what a man feels that counts , Mary , it 's what he does . And for you , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on down and talk to this bad Cherokee Snake Stick . I mean . . . Tears suddenly were running into his ears . I mean , I love ' ee , Mary , more than I love my life . And here in the middle of this Indian town I got no more reason for scare than you do in that Indian town you 're in . I mean , you 're but a woman !  |p171THE  big catfish lay on the silty creek bottom alongside a black sunken log , no more than ten inches down in crystal-clear water . It was the biggest catfish Mary had ever seen ; surely it was three feet long . Its gray-green back was so close to the color of the rreekbed that she never would have seen it but for the slight motion of its whiskers and the slow undulation of fins and tail as it held itself in place against the current . Mary squatted on the bank above the fish . Moving as stealthily as possible , she braced herself on one knee and raised her sharpened hickory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind her , squirming with impatience and whispering what might have been prayers or advice . " Hush ! " Mary whispered . Her hand was trembling , both because of anxiety and because she was shaky from hunger . They had walked three days since their detour around the Buffalo River without findingso much as a blackberry to eat . Ghetel today had resorted to eating grass to keep something in her stomach , but Mary had heard men say that was not a good thing to do , and so she had not . When the hunger had become unbearable in the last two days , she had simply drunk water until her stomach could hold no more . Then she would feel the hunger not in her belly but in the fibers of her limbs . And in her mind . Now she held the tip of the lance , which she had whittled to a narrow , needle-sharp point with the tomahawk , about a foot above the surface of the water and aimed it at a spot just an inch below thep172catfish 's undulating fin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not do when she struck : she must not hit an inch too high or too low , or the point would slip off the fish 's slippery side . She must strike hard enough that the point would penetrate the fish and not just knock it aside . And , as the point of the lance was not barbed to hold the fish , she must drive it all the way through the creature and pin him to the bottom and hold him there despite his thrashing , until they could plunge their hands into the water and get a grip on him . She had never realized until now that hunting was as much a thing of the mind as of the body . And when one was starving , it was hard for the mind to make the body wait until it was all figured out . She gathered the ready strength in her right arm until it felt like the cocked hammer of a gun . This was the first time in her experience that her life had depended on her killing a creature ; always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been necessary . They , like the Indians , had thought it to be man 's work . Her heart pounded . Now ! Her arm snapped down . The spear shaft swished into the water . It seemed to bend upward under the surface and stuck into the creek bottom . Clouds of roiling silt marked the place where the fish had been . She groaned and the old woman wailed a curse in her language . Because of refraction in the water , the fish had seemed higher than it actually had been . The lance had jabbed through the water a good two inches above it . It was a lesson she must remember the next time she had a fish lying under her sight like this . If I ever do , she thought . It had been so perfect . Too perfect . Big fish do n't just lie down where you can reach them every day , she thought . The old woman was stamping along the creek bank , ranting bitterly , yelling that she would do it next time . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up weakly , little starlike dots swimming behind her eyes . The dots went away . Water and mud dribbled off the end of her lance . She fixed a hard gaze on Ghetel . The old woman 's tantrum subsided like a pan of boiling milk lifted off the fire.  | " Y'do it next time , then , " Mary muttered . " Tai n't so easy as y 'd think . " On the eleventh day of their freedom they had to walk five miles upstream and then five miles downstream to get around another creek that had barred their progress up the bank of the O-y-o . That evening they found a clump of tall , wilting yellow flowers growing at the edge of a natural meadow . Mary had seen fields of these flowers near the Shawnee town and thus guessed that they were somehow edible . She and Ghetel tried eating the flower heads , then the leaves , but they were unbearably vile-tasting . Then Ghetel grabbed one of the stalks and pulled with all her strength . The flower came out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knobby root . Mary chopped off sections of this root with the tomahawkand found it to be white and crisp , almost as palatable as a raw potato . They pulled up all the stalks and obtained about a pound of the tubers . They ate them that evening and then lay down on a bed of leaves in the lee of a fallen log . With the awful gnawing gone out of their stomachs for the time being , they had only the pain in their bartered feet and legs to keep them awake . Those miseries soon were blanketed by their numbing exhaustion and they were asleep before midnight , under a huge sky full of chilly blue stars . On the twelfth day they had to go around another small tributary . Near this one , shortly before nightfall , they found a large fall of acorns under a chestnut oak . They had no fire nor kettle with which to boil the tannin out of the acorns , and so had to shell them and eat them bitter-raw . The first few tasted good even though bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallow . But again that night they slept with something in their stomachs and awoke with a bit of strength in their limbs to continue with the thirteenth day of their escape . That day , as if thirteen were indeed unlucky , they found absolutely nothing to eat and went to bed groaning with hunger and aching limbs . Mary lay looking up at the stars and listening to the river , and through the rents in her dress she examinedher body with her fingers . Her pelvic bones under her skin felt like wooden furniture covered with cloth . There seemed to be no flesh . Her belly , which had been so swollen and turgid with child atp174the start of this ordeal  --  the massacre at Draper 's Meadows now seemed years past , though it had been only three months  --  now sagged concave between her pelvis and her rib cage , and her breasts were hard and dry . They had stopped making milk . She looked at the stars until her eyes burned , to keep from thinkingabout the baby . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was almost as if there had never been a baby , except when she would envision its eyes and mouth . Mary finally went to sleep lulled by the rhythm of Ghetel 's snores , and dreamed of Tommy and Georgie and her mother . They had been gone two weeks from the salt camp when , toward evening , Mary glanced over the O-y-o and saw a canoe moving northward across it . The canoe was at this distance a mere sliver of sunlit gray on the green water . Mary stopped and the old woman almost stumbled over her . Mary pointed at the faraway moving shape . They watched it head straight for the northern shore and then it disappeared . She recognized the spot then . It was the mouth of the Scioto . Her heart thudded . " Ghetel ! " She found herself whispering . " There ! There w 'd be the Shawnee town ! Up that river there ! " The old woman stared , eyes bulging , mouth hanging slack . " Gott , " she exclaimed , " yesss ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means we 've come along a hundred and fifty miles ! Maybe more like two hundred , countin ' all them go-arounds ! " " So , eh ? " The old woman blew like a winded horse . " I 'm feelink like fife hunder . " They rested lying concealed in high grass overlooking the river and discussed the dangers of being this close to the Shawnee town . They had come up to a place almost directly opposite the mouth of the Scioto and now in the ruddy-gold cross-light of the sunset they could see some of the fields and huts of the town on the far shore , and the haze of smoke from cooking fires . Now and then the bark of a dog or a wisp of human voice would carry to them across the wide river . They would have to move in concealment and as quietly asp175possible , Mary warned . She remembered the little Indian farm on this side of the river where she and her fellow captives had been held in wait for the canoes to come and ferry them across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She tried to remember . She seemed to remember that there had been a large yellow dog sleeping in the shade of a canoe . If it was a regular ferrying place , of course , there would likely be danger of considerable Indian traffic : war parties , hunting parties . " We ought to lay here the night , " she said , " then head away from the river at sunup , and go around . " The old woman was gazing wistfully at the smoke across the river . " Dey got food over there , " she said , clutching her belly and nu king . " I could eat a dog or two . Ach . Dog , yet . " Mary 's stomach too was an unrelieved silent scream of hunger . Then she remembered the cornfield at the little Indian homestead . It might not have been harvested yet . The more she thought of corn , the less she wanted to lie here till morning . Sleep would be impossible anyway . She began to grow desperately brave . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the bluffs downriver and it was twilight when Mary and the old woman crawled through weeds Along a pole fence , watching the Indian hut for signs of light or movement , meanwhile making their way toward the cornfield . So fur t hey had not heard a voice nor smelled a wisp of smoke nor seen a spark of fireglow . But Mary remembered the young boys she had wen here and knew that they would be as alert as watchdogs if they were about . Sliding silent as snakes through the weeds alongside the fence , she and the old woman suddenly froze . Very close ahead they had heard a heavy footfall  --  or , rather , felt it through the soft ground on which they lay  --  and heard a heavy huff of breath like a sigh . As they flattened themselves further in the weeds with slamming heartbeats , they heard two more footfalls , followed by a dull metallic clunk . A large dark shape then moved beyond the screen of weeds not three yards in front of them , causing the metallic sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up into a dark brown eye , which was looking down at her.  |p176A  horse ! It was a roan horse with a bell on its neck . And at the moment she recognized what it was , the beast saw her in the weeds and shied . It half-reared , sidestepped , bell clanking loudly , then ran thumping and rustling into the scrub . Mary and Ghetel lay with their hearts pounding against the ground , covered with sudden cold sweat , now expecting the horse 's flight to bring someone out of the hut , which was but a few feet away . For five minutes they waited in the deepening twilight . There was not a sound or movement from the house . In the distance the horse 's bell was still clunk-clunking . " I do wonder , does this place be deserted , " she whispered to Ghetel . " Wait now . " She arose as smoothly as her grinding leg joints would allow , and stood swaying for a moment . Her feet throbbed and stung as she put her weight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the dizziness was gone she looked over the fence , which was a sort of corral ; two of its poles were down nearby , explaining why the belled horse was wandering about . She could see the entire hut and much of its setting now , and grew more certain that it was deserted . Gathering more daring than she had suspected she had , she crept up to the very wall of the hut and put her ear to it , then went around slowly to the front , raised a hide door-flap , stooped and looked into the dark interior , smelling the musty , smoky closeness inside . She trembled , ready to thrust with the sharp lance if anything moved . Suddenly a twig snapped just behind her and a figure moved with a swish . Mary 's scalp flushed with prickles and , her heart in her mouth , she spun and thrust the hickory lance with all her strength at a hulking human figure that was suddenly there in silhouette against the evening 's hazy red afterglow . " AIIII ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Mary recognized the cry and the shape as Ghetel 's and a shiver of horror cascaded down her flanks . " Jesus in Heaven ! " the old woman hissed , grabbing the shaft of the spear and yanking it out of the fabric of her dress . The point had missed Ghetel 's neck by an inch and ripped through the right side of her collar.  |p177Mary  was in an uproar of confusion , of sinking relief and rising fury . The two stood staring at each other for long seconds . " How dare y ' creep up on a body at a time like this ? " Mary finally hissed . " M'Gott ! I fought you would need me ! " The old woman 's voice too was quavering with indignation . They sagged toward each other then with shuddering sighs and hugged each other 's bones for support . The old woman patted Mary 's shoulder , and then the hazards of their situation dawned on them again . They had been loud with their gasps and exclamations . They stooped at the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the far shore of the river now , points of campfire light gleamed . A fingernail moon hung above a bluff in the east . Two owls were fluting to each other from different horizons . Mary wondered whether they were real owls . It was black inside the hut . The women had decided it was truly vacant . They felt around for things . They found only a broken clay pot , a strap of hide about a yard long and a bed of crushed boughs and leaves near the back wall . In the center of the hut was a circle of river stones around a pile of cold ashes . It was apparent that the Indian family had departed for some time , if not for good . They went out into the cornfield and found to their joy that the ears were nearly ripe but had not been harvested yet . Mary said grace under the slice of moon . " Thankee , Heavenly Lord , for this manna . " For a while then the only sounds were the rustling of cornstalks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . Mary soon felt a rising queasiness replacing her terrible emptiness . She swallowed a mouthful of the moist , starchy mass , then warned : " Must n't eat too much at once , Ghetel . Might be we 'll have a late supper too , eh ? " They went down to the river and drank water out of cupped hands , then back to the fence where they had left their blankets . They sat there in the weeds with their blankets draped over their shoulders , the night air chilling their ears and scalps , listening to the burbling and stitching of frantic digestion in their distended stomachs . Occasionally they rocked to and fro , for warmth and to help the food work down . After a while Mary realizedit would be hours before she would be able to eat again , but the old woman was still thinking of food as she had been for days , and she could not bear to ignore the cornfield before bedtime . She wentp178among the stalks and gnawed the kernels off of two more ears before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Da'st we sleep ' neath a roof ? " Mary ventured . She was growing drowsy over her full stomach . " I think there be frost a-comin ' on my head . " " 0 for a roof , yah . Why not , eh ? " They went in the hut and spread their blankets on the Indians ' old bed-square , and rolled up in them , each with her spear lying at hand , after Mary had worked a bark shingle of the back wall loose to provide an escape-hole should anyone enter by the front door . It was fearsome to be sleeping in the home of savages who might or might not return , and the possibilities bothered her for an hour even as she grew cozy and less and less inclined to move . She decided to leave that chance in God 's hands , and prayed so . Ghetel was not snoring yet , either , and late in the night Mary heard her chuckle . " What ? " A sigh from the old woman . Then : " Vas I mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this night you do n't spear good ! " They laughed softly , and then they were able to sleep . Mary woke with a gasp , the tense grip of a strong hand on her arm . Ghetel was clutching her , sitting up in her blanket and staring toward the grainy silver predawn light in the doorway . Somewhere out there , dry leaves were rustling loudly , as if many people were walking without concern for stealth . The two women freed themselves from their warm blankets and snatched up their spears . In her waking panic , Mary recollected details of their situation ; she remembered the escape door she had made in the back wall . On hands and knees she turned and lifted down the slab of bark and looked out into the nearby cornfield . The noise was coming from there . She could see cornstalks jerkingand moving . They dared not try to escape from this side . She watched , frozen , for Indians to emerge from the corn . The first face poked out among the leathery stalks . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly went almost silly with mirth . She reached back and grabbed Ghetel 's arm and pulled her down to the opening to show her the intruders . The faces were looking toward the hut . They had comical blackp179masks over their eyes , and busy little black noses . Then one of the raccoons rose on its hind legs , reached up with little hands and grasped an ear of corn . It shucked it skillfully and then started eating the tender kernels from the middle of the ear . " Eh ! " Ghetel cried . " It 's our corn ! GET ! " She scrambled to her feet and ran toward the front door with her hickory lance , abandoningall caution . By the time she had plunged into the corn patch , flailing with her stick , the furry little bandits had vanished and Mary was almost helpless with laughter . It seemed the misery of ages dissolved and sloughed off with this release . She was wiping her eyes when Ghetel returned stooping , grumbling , through the door . " Ah , Ghetel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dawn they picked as much corn as they could tie up in the blankets , breakfasting on plump ears as they worked . They watched over their shoulders toward the woods and thickets , and kept an eye on the river for canoes . Their laughter might have been heard across the river in this morning stillness . Sounds from the Shawnee town were drifting over clearly enough : snatches of voice ; the faraway thump of some tool ; the very distant gunshot of some hunter on the other side of the O-y-o . Mary was anxious to be well out of the vicinity of the town and this camp before broad daylight . They harvested rapidly the ears that the raccoons had not sampled . The little animals had done an amazing amount of sampling . . . " Hush ! " Mary whispered , listening . It was the clunking of the horse 's bell . Mary moved to the corral and saw the roan standing inside , looking at her . The animal appeared quite tame , evidently over its fright of the previous evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallen rails of the corral and then went into the hut and returned with the hide strap . " How 'd y ' like us t ' have a horse ? " she said to Ghetel , who was knotting the corners of a blanket full of corn . " Yah ! For dinner , you say ? " " Nay , for ridin ' ! " " Ah , ' at vould be acceptable also . My feets say so . Ha ! " Having won the horse 's allegiance with a handful of corn and a few syllables of sweet talk , Mary easily got the leather strap tied top180the thong that supported its bell . The horse was a mare , docile , long in the tooth , and so complacent and easily led that Mary presumed she was accustomed to white people . Probably stolen from whites , she thought . With quick and surprising ingenuity and some strips of leatherwood bark , Ghetel retied the blankets in such a way that they could be slung over the horse 's back with a bulging load of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready to continue upriver . They were more cheerful than they had ever seen each other . They were strengthened by a supper and a breakfast of corn . They had enough food to last for several days , and a horse to carry it and themselves . They had already proven themselves by their first hundred and fifty miles , and with this food and this wonderful heaven-sent mare , the next three or four hundred miles loomed comparatively easy . " You ride first , Mary , " the old woman offered magnanimously . " I lead . " Mary suspected Ghetel was afraid to go first on an untried horse , but of course did not venture that appraisal . " No , " she said . " Till we 're out o ' this vicinity , let 's us stay low . We 'll both walk . " " Ah , yah . " They tried to keep themselves far enough inland that they could not be seen from across the river , but soon found that the cane and undergrowth were impenetrable everywhere but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they could do was stay along the trail most of the time and hope they would not meet any parties of Indians coming down . It was a pleasant morning . Though they were in rags now , the walking and the food in them kept them warm , and the sun was pleasant on their faces when they were out of the shadows . The horse 's hooves thudded softly , a reminder of this gift of Providence , and the little bell on its neck clanked , a sound musical and civilized to their ears after the rushings and roars and deep silences of the wilderness they had heard for so long , after the gunfire and tortured screams and sobbings of grief that had begun their wanderings in this savage purgatory . The bell was a dull bronze ; old , and Mary wondered where it had come from . Civilized hands had made it , she was sure ; bells were civilized things . Maybe it was part of the bootyp181brought here by raiding Indians . The kind of thing LaPlante and Goulart traded for skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very trading post sometime , she thought . The blue and white checked pattern of shirt cloth moved in her mind behind her eyes . It seemed ages since she had been engaged in that business . Even that , in a way , seemed like civilization compared with the elemental subsistence of these last weeks . But she smiled to herself . It was good not to be the bounden partner of those Frenchmen any more . She was free . With corn to eat and a companion who , though erratic and difficult , was a companion nonetheless , and with a good horse with a civilized bell . But that bell , she thought suddenly . P'raps for safety it ought to be thrown away . She stopped the horse and reached to untie it . " Vat you do here , eh ? " " Get rid o ' this . Kind o ' noisy fr sneakin ' by Indians . . The old woman grabbed her hands and jerked them down . Mary looked at her in astonishment . " No , " Ghetel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good luck . Haf to keep . I had dream , the bell is good luck for us . " " Nonsense . It could be the death of us . . " She reached again ; again Ghetel shoved her hands away , with real roughness . Then the old woman 's face softened and brightened . She held a finger to her temple , indicating the source of an idea . She stooped and gathered a handful of leaves and stuffed them inside the bell , around the clapper . Then she tore off one of the rag tatters that had once been her dress , and bound up the bell to keep the leaves from falling out . " There , " she said . " So ve keep the bell . Is luck . " Mary shrugged . The little conflict of the moment was gone . And , in truth , she would have hated to throw the civilized little bell away into the wilderness anyway . Ghetel had done well , with her fond little superstition . The horse was proving a great comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ledge of limestone and slipped a leg over the animal 's broad back , tentatively , in case the mare was not accustomed to a rider . Gone are the days , she thought , when I could just spring on . The horse turned her ears and quivered her mane and tried to look back , but Ghetel held her firmly by the lead . Mary slidp182the rest of her weight onto the horse 's back in the space in front of the bundles of corn . The mare blew softly but stood steady . " Eh , now . Lead on , Ghetel , I think she 's no objection whatever . " Mary was lulled by the motion of the horse 's progress , and realized how weary she was . Her legs tingled and throbbed in waves . Having no underclothing , and scarcely any outer garments , she was directly against the horse 's hide , could feel the friction against the insides of her thighs like a massage soothing away the stress , could feel the animal 's flesh giving slightly over its ribs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into fits of dozing , or rather trances of oblivion , as she did not close her eyes ; and faces and scenes from Draper 's Meadows  --  the faces of her mother and the boys , Will sitting before the hearth luxuriating while she washed and kneaded his feet after a strenuous day ; the ticking of the old grandfather clock as she lay awake looking at his sleeping profile after love while the pleasure of it in her loins ebbed into the deepest sort of ease such dreams of their old hard but heavenly life drifted like smoke behind her eyes . Will had often said that the kindest thing people could do for each other was tend to each other 's feet at day 's end , and he had " done " her feet almost as often as she had done his ; she could feel now Will 's strong , warm hands kneading her arches almost to the limit of bearability , sometimes making her legs twitch , and his loving fingers flexing her toes , pulling them until their joints popped softly but surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ankles until her calves would relax  --  oh what a sweet good man was her Will ! Capable of the biggest and boldest efforts but kindly and attentive to the smallest need , always having time to give to anyone who needed him , however tired he was or how full of tomorrow his mind might be . . . I 'm a-comin ' back t ' y , William Ingles ; oh I vow I 'll reach ' ee . . . Suddenly a bolt of dread snapped her out of this reverie . In her mind she had seen a looming of dark faces . She opened her eyes onto the bright innocent yellow and crimson of autumn foliage , seeing nothing ahead but the horse 's neck and ears and Ghetel 's wild iron-gray hair and the gauntlet-stripe scars on the sagging skin of her back . But the feeling would not leave ; it was the feeling which on that July Sunday morning had made her glance repeatedly at thep183cabin door . She could not ignore it . " Ghetel. ! I 'm a-gettin ' off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to her , reflecting the alarm she had detected in Mary 's voice . She halted the mare and Mary slid off to the ground . The pain of the sudden weight on her half-rested feet and legs almost made her fall . " Listen , " she whispered , " something'sa-tellin ' me we ought to get off this trail . . . " At that moment the mare 's ears pricked up and she gave a low nicker , her head turned toward the shadows under a lofty wood . From somewhere in those shadows came the muffled sound of a man 's voice . They listened . A moment later it came again , louder . Mary jabbed with a finger toward a thicket of sycamores and locusts lying down the slope at their left , close to the river bank , and both the women hauled at the neck-halter to bring the animal along . They made a din of rustling and crackling on the leaf-andtwigcarpeted floor of the thicket , and had just halted the mare behind a head-high clump of scrub when Mary saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afoot , all warriors or hunters , going westward along the trail , toward the Shawnee town . They wore no war paint but carried their muskets at their sides . Several of the braves , in pairs , carried poles across their shoulders and there were dead animals and fowl hanging from these poles by their feet or necks . Mary counted thirteen men passing , then a brindled pack horse with the whole carcasses of two small deer over its back , then another horse , a large bay , carrying a black bear strapped across it , the bear 's hanging head swaying and bobbing with the horse 's movements . Ghetel watched them and kept crouching lower and lower , as if wishing the earth would swallow and hide her big pink and gray body . Mary watched under the mare 's neck , stroking to keep her from starting or neighing . The hunters took a long time in passing . They were casual and jovial , talking and sometimes grunting out short , coughlike bursts of laughter . The two women remained still for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage had faded . They stood letting their heartbeats and breathing return to normal , watching the trail for any sign that the group might have been only part of a larger body . At last a horsyp184smile spread over Ghetel 's face and she looked at Mary with some wonder . " I don ' know how you know , " she said , beginning to shake her head , " but I listen to you after now . " " Tell y ' what I fear , " Mary said . " That afore this day 's done , them hunters will look down an ' see our tracks a-comin ' thisaway , an ' send somebody back here t ' see who we be . That 's what I fear as much as meetin ' more savages headlong . " Ghetel considered this , nodding and running her tongue thoughtfully over her back gums with elaborate ruminating movementsof her lower jaw . Finally she announced : " Ven I vatch to th ' back , you vatch to th ' front . My turn to ride now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to climb up , den . " And when Mary led the mare alongside a fallen log Ghetel could use as a mounting block , the old woman hoisted her broad bony rump onto the horse 's back as if she were getting onto a sidesaddle . Then , to Mary 's astonishment and amusement , she raised her left leg , instead of her right , and lowered it over the other side so that she was astraddle but backward , looking over the horse 's rump . She turned and looked down at Mary . " Now ve go , " she said , " and I see ' em if they follow . " Mary stared at her for a moment , mouth hanging open , then shook her head . " So be it ! " she laughed . " Hang on ! " And so they continued , up an Indian trail through the blazing fall foliage in the valley of the beautiful river , keeping a vigil fore and aft.  |p185THEIR  great fortune in obtaining the horse seemed also to have extended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild , dry , southerly winds , sun-gilded , fleecy clouds cruising across a pearly blue sky . The wind soughed high in the trees above them , sent shivers across the surface of the river and stripped off the first loose leaves of autumn . A gust would boom in the crowns of the towering hardwoods ; leaves would spill off and whirl away like yellow snowstorms . Deep drifts of ochre and orange and crimson leaves deepened on the forest floor , fragrant and crisp and easy underfoot . Docile wasps and weary flies stitched leisurely through slanting sunbeams . Mary and Ghetel went on through this dry , balmy weather , taking turns riding and leading the mare , wading and limping through the rustling leaves , carrying their homemade lances upraised , like a pair of tatterdemalion remnants of some Amazonian cavalry . Mary sang her little homing ballad often as they went along . Ghetel had abandoned her retrospective mode of riding the first time the mare lunged roughly up a bluff and there was no inane to hang onto . The nights were dry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , more slowly certainly than if they had dared try to kindle a fire to cook it in any manner . Drying on the cob day by day , it made a gritty and starchy meal , almost like eating chalk , so they did not eat as much as they would have if it were more palatable . The few handfuls of berries , walnuts , wild grapes and persimmons they found each day were a wonderful relief . Because of her lack of molars , Ghetel had to find some way to crackp186and pulverize her corn , and usually smashed it with the blunt side of the tomahawk on a rock until she had a small dirty pile of yellowwhitegrit that she could wash down with water . She ingested a fair amount of dirt and stone dust due to this primitive milling process . Mary 's own teeth were beginning to ache and loosen because of their wretched diet , and she would have strange twinges and itches in her gums , and could suck a taste of rot from between her grindingteeth . But at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately took satisfaction in the little hard stools they left behind every morning . Mary estimated that they were covering twice as much distance each day as they had before acquiring the wonderful animal , partly because the horse could carry them both across creek mouths and shallow rivers they would have been afraid to wade on foot . The mare was a good forder. , not skittish at entering water , and would with good footing make her way across a strong current as high as her withers , with the two women astride her , the water reaching their hips , Mary clutching the mane , Ghetel embracing Mary 's scrawny waist . And when the mare would clamber out on the far bank , both the women would fuss over her , hug her neck , kiss her muzzle , stroke her throatlatch , hand-feed her a little corn and perhaps let her rest and graze if they were in grassy country . Mary had always loved horses , but never had she loved one with the same choking , tear-starting love she felt for this benevolent lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so desperately needed it . Sometimes she would look into the deep brown , soft-lashed eyes and would feel a rush of appreciation that felt almost like a prayer . " Ah , God , " she exclaimed once , " would that people could be so good ! " But sometimes that kind of communion could devastate her soul , because into that same rich upwelling of emotion the images of her three lost children would rush , as if through a gate suddenly left unguarded . On their third day with the horse , they came to a sandy-bottomed tributary that Mary distinctly remembered from the trip down in the captivity of Captain Wildcat . The Indians had crossed it in a canoe and had secreted the vessel in a canebrake on this shore . " Wait , " she said , and leaving Ghetel with the horse , pushed herp187way into the tall , waving yellow-green stalks , holding her hickory lance in front of her , both to part the reeds and to be ready in case she should come upon a water moccasin  --  or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of a canoe . A loud splash a few feet in front of her made her recoil and break out in a cold sweat , and she stood with thudding heart until she decided that she had only startled a sunning bullfrog . She crept farther into this world of black mud and shimmering vertical lines , her shoes filling with cold water , but found no sign of a canoe . Eh , well , she thought . Likely some outbound party 's left it on t' other shore . As she started to turn back , her eye caught a glistening dark lump in the shallows almost at her feet ; it was pulsating . It was a huge bullfrog , half submerged , gathering itself to leap away . With a quick , desperate stab of her spear she impaled it . She turned her face from its sudden awful thrashing and squirming and waited until it was still . " May-ry ? May-ry ? " the old woman had begun querying , when Mary emerged from the brake proudly holding up her stick with the limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel . Look . Our first meat . " They twisted its big legs off and slid the slimy skin off as if pulling off stockings , and hunkered there on the river bank like a pair of aborigines , gnawing at the cold raw pink-white meat . Mary glanced up once from her own bone-picking and saw a string of slobber running from Ghetel 's underlip as she threw away her froglegbones and started examining the rest of the frog . When Ghetel reached for it and began pulling off its tiny little arms , Mary had to look away . Something about the look of Ghetel 's ' hunger had sent a cold bolt of unnameable horror through her . They went five miles up the west bank of that river , stumbling through ravines and forcing their way through thickets and bramblesthat cut and lashed their skin and further shredded their rags , before finding a shallows of sand and gravel bottom where they could ride the mare across . Then they returned down the east bank . Here they had to lead the horse and walk through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few leathery , hard , wrinkled grapes within reach , but obviously their season was past and they were no pleasure to eat . Nonetheless , the women gathered a few bunches and slipped them into the blanket bundles with their remaining corn . They were certain that there would come a time when even these would taste good . They were smeared with their own blood when they struggled at last out of the thorn ticket . They rinsed their limbs with river water , dug little black thorn-ends out of their wounds and continued downstream toward the O-y-o . Almost immediately they came to a creek mouth no more than knee-deep but strewn for yards with mossy , flat , sharp-edged rocks the size of dinner plates and tabletops , which tilted and slid and turned under their feet . By the time they had teetered and crashed across these to the other side , their rotten shoes had finished falling apart , and they were forced to abandon them and continue down the shore on bare , bloody feet that felt as if every bone in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabs of twigs and stones in their soles , until their tender feet were at last so full of throbbing pains that new jabs could scarcely be felt . They took turns riding , but it seemed their feet hurt even worse hanging free beside the horse 's ribs than when they were being walked on . And , even more alarming , the mare herself was limping since the passage over the rocks . Mary examined her and found oozing abrasions , one on the pastern of her left foreleg and one under her right hind fetlock  --  very critical places , Mary knew , which could render her lame and useless if they were unlucky . So the women both dismounted and walked . They stopped for the day at midafternoon when the O-y-o came in view . Here they retied the neck halter into a hobble and set the mare to grazing . Mary limped about for a while looking for comfrey to make dressings for their feet and the mare 's legs , but found none and presumed that the season for finding it was now past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dredge up some muck from the river 's edge and put it on the mare 's wounds , feeling that this would at least soothe them . While stooping there she saw a long dark shape lying among the reeds  --  a rotting log , she thought at first  --  which closer examination revealed to be a ruined Indian canoe , half-sunk inp189the shallows , with slabs of its bark cover fallen away from its hickory frame . This only reminded her that their entire route followed wellusedIndian trails , and that there could be no carelessness or excessivenoise . And though she yearned for the comfort of a campfire , for hot water to heal their feet , and she probably could have started one even without flint and steel  --  she had watched squaws at the Shawneetown ignite tinder with an easily made bow-and-drill device  --  it would be foolhardy in the extreme to do it . She packed the cool black muck on the horse 's fetlock and pastern while Ghetel sat nearby , watching with an approving look while mashing corn and wild grapes together on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water to the meal later and made it into a purple paste that , while strange and awful to the palate , was certain to be nourishing , and did extend their little store of corn somewhat . Each time they arose to move about their camp , flashes of pain shot up from their battered feet . Mary remembered then the thoughts she had had so recently about Will , about their very personal attention to each other 's feet . She looked at the poor hag beside her , at her wrinkled , scratched skin hanging like wattles off her arms , and suddenly was drawn out of herself by a great tug of pity . " Come , Ghetel , " she said . And then for an hour as the late afternoon sun warmed their faces , they sat at the river 's edge , and Mary kneaded and palpated the old woman 's misshapen feet , those bundles of bones and calluses and knobby joints , with the rich mud , while Ghetel groaned deep with pain and delight . Mary talked of Will as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then tears would run off the end of her nose . Ghetel worked on Mary 's feet then , and talked to her about old Holland , whence she had come twenty years ago , " when I vas gutluckinklike you , " and about great kitchens she had known , with copper pots and ladles and sausages hanging from the rafters , and cheeses maturing in cloth , and butter in the churns , and big porcelainovens fragrant with new bread , until Mary was driven to ex-claim : " Have mercy ! Y 're caressin ' me at one end an ' torturin ' me at t ' other ! "  |p190Their  feet gave them agony the next morning when they first put their weight on them , but as they limbered with the walking , the pain lessened to a healthy ache and it became apparent that they really were much better . Neither of them rode the horse that morning , but walked and led her and studied her gait . She did not limp , and did not start limping as the day wore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much good for her as for them . " We like as not can ride ' er tomorrow , " Mary said . They went eastward all that morning , seeing no sign of Indians and finding nothing but a fall of acorns to supplement their dwindlingcorn . At midday their course began to veer southeasterly , and Mary went back over her mental library of landscapes . As she recollected , there were still three major river mouths to be crossed before they would reach the great northeasterly curve in the O-y-o 's rivercourseand find the place , that pleasant point , where the waters of the New River flowed into the O-y-o . P'raps seventy or eighty miles to that place , she thought . But it could add up to two hundred if them three rivers ' twixt here and there detour us much . Their good weather gave out at midday . A sudden chill blasted over the river valley , sending millions of leaves spinning away in red and yellow whirlwinds , buffeting the treetops with an intimidating rush and moan . Iron-gray clouds came scudding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in five minutes the river was flint-colored and seething with whitecaps . Chilly gusts blew the women 's hair over their faces and flattened it against their scalps , and the air around them was full of spinning leaves and twigs . Their rags flapped and fluttered around them and they inched along squinting , staying close in the lee of the mare . And soon their skin -- most of it exposed now by the disintegration of the clothes  --  was being pelted by cold , driven raindrops that stung like sleet . The wind increased , so cold and powerful it seemed to suck out their breath . An enormous dead beech tree gave up its foothold on the slope a few yards above them and crashed to the ground , splitting and splintering smaller trees as it bore them to earth . The mare shied , reared and bolted . Mary hung onto its neck bridle through ten awful seconds , her feet hardly touching the ground , until shep191dragged the beast to a nervous , snorting standstill fifty yards father on . Ghetel , emitting little yelps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that strange , arm-pumping trot that had carried her through the gauntlet . Steeling themselves against the wet cold and the shouting wind , they walked the rest of the afternoon away , both hanging on to the mare as if they might otherwise be blown aside into the river . Mary , though she had lived close to the edge of the wilderness most of her adult life , had never felt quite this way : like a weightless little speck of chaff lost in a universe of tumultuous elements , shrieking trees and indifferent mountains . But finally , about sunset time , when the wet leaves were cold and limp underfoot and the wet tatters of clothing stuck to the pasty gooseflesh of their skin , a dull rose glow began to burnish the bluffs across the seething river . Great horizontal rents opened in the purple clouds above the western horizon and glowed scarlet like bloody wounds . Soon a slice of setting sun looked through these rents and glinted in every droplet on every twig and every blade of grass . And finally the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud ; and the storm receding across the river made a vast , bruise-colored backdrop for a perfect rainbow that seemed to straddle the river . Even through her misery , Mary felt she was seeing the work of a God whom she had not thought much of for many weeks . She and Ghetel rolled up together in a wet cocoon of wool blankets that night , hugging , skin to skin , and shivered until the feeble furnaces of their hearts warmed their blood . While they slept , bold chipmunks and squirrels crept close and nibbled at the little pile of musty corn they had emptied out of their blankets. , Mary rode first the next morning . Ghetel , walking barefooted on sparkling frost , led the horse . The ground was blanketed with wet leaves of every hue from livid crimson to flame-yellow , all their colors intensified by the wet and frost and wan morning sunlight . Ghetel was singing something to herself in Dutch , just above a whisper , her breath and the mare 's breath condensing . Mary had her blanket over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tote in one blanket now . They had agreed that the one ridingp192would enjoy the blanket , as the one walking would generate her own heat . But if Ghetel was warm she did not show it . Her skin was raised in bumps like a plucked turkey 's , and every few seconds a great tremor would shake her from one , end to the other . God , but she is a rugged old thing , Mary thought . But I 'd best trade places with her and give her the blanket right quick or she 's like t ' come down with a grippe ere this day is out . She hugged herself inside the blanket . In just a minute , she thought . Gusty weather came again the next day . Dark clouds sped over the hilltops trailing veils of rain . The wind was so strong that a cloud would pass from horizon to horizon in a minute 's time . Shrubberyshook and rattled as if being slapped to and fro by an invisible giant hand . The air was always full of flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clung against the wind but invariably was picked off and swirled away , and the trees were almost bare now , bare and gray and brown , and their stark , desolate nakedness had a chilling effect on the spirit . Mary pondered on this as she walked along . I do believe the sight o ' them autumn leaves , like the colors o ' flame , kept my poor soul warm just like watchin ' a fire will do f'r a body . . . And she found herself thinking as she rode , looking down at Ghetel , who was at that moment walking and leading the mare : If only these blankets was red , a nice hot red instead o ' this cold gray , we 'd be a sight warmer . . . And then she smiled at her fancy . Y 're goin ' a bit daft there , girl . Best y ' get down an ' let of Ghetel sit up here a-rockin ' and a-daydreamin ' a spell . . . That day they came to another river mouth too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel gazed at the far shore and groaned . These detours seemed to frustrate her even more than they did Mary  --  perhaps because , unlike Mary , she did not know the lay of the land , and every new stream was just another unexpected obstacle , as if God were spitefully throwing down new rivers in their path every day to make their way longer . So they turned and started up this latest river.  |p193In  skirting a marsh in this river 's valley , they found a stand of browning arrowleaf stalks . They tied the horse nearby and spent an hour wading in the cold ooze , feeling with their toes for the tubers , stooping to pull them up when they found some . They gathered five or six pounds of them , put them in the bundle with the musty corn and continued upstream . This river was wide and was running fast with brown water from the recent rains . It appeared they would have a long trek up its banks before finding a place to cross . And all the while they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the O-y-o River , their guide through the wilderness , dropping farther and farther behind them . They tried to make a meal of the arrowleaf tubers that evening , encamped under an overhanging ledge with the flooding river roaringnoisily a few feet below . The raw tubers had an awful , woody , bitter taste . " If'n we had a pot t ' bile ' em in , " Mary grimaced , " I swear right now I 'd risk buildin ' a fire to do it . " But they were filling . They had traveled perhaps twenty-five miles up this nameless river , when , the next day , Ghetel pointed down and cried , " Look ! a britch ! " At a place where the river thundered down over a kind of rock step , a mass of driftwood had become lodged . It extended all the way across the river , a tangle of bleached logs and limbs and roots , and indeed was like a bridge . The brown water rushed through and under it , but it stayed , a great knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ghetel urged with a happy , yellowtoothedgrin . But Mary looked at it dubiously . It seemed firm enough , but . . . " Wait now , " she said . " I 'm getting a bad feeling about this . It do n't look none too sure t ' me , somehow . " Ghetel turned a darkening face on her , then pointed upstream . " Eh , how far you vant to go up dis riffer , eh ? Look ! " Above the driftwood bridge the river was still deep and swift . They might have to go another twenty-five miles before finding a fording place , maybe farther . And that would mean fifty or more back down the other bank to regain the O-y-o . That was an awful prospect.  |p194And  here was this bridge , as if put here by Providence to save them three or four days ' travel . But the bridge nonetheless gave her a premonition of dread . And she was learning to take her premonitions seriously . " Vatch me , " Ghetel was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She reached out , grasped a protruding limb for a handhold , put one foot on one of the logs . Then , cautiously , she lifted the other foot off the shore . She stood a moment on the end of the bridge , then began flexing her knees , rocking her weight on the lodgment , testing its solidity . Then she bounced more violently , crying , " Vatch ! Vatch ! It stays ! " Do n't , Mary thought . It seemed too reckless a taunting of Fate . But it held . Ghetel backed onto the shore , grinning . " Easy , " she said . " See ? " " Aye , for us , p'raps . But a horse canno ' walk logs , Ghetel . " " I t'ink she can do . It is like a britch , May-ry . Like a britch . " " I have this feeling . . . " " Go to the deffil wit ' a feelink ! " Ghetel 's face was growing stormy with impatience . " If you don ' come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve 'll see ! Who need you and your feelink ? " " No , Ghetel , please . .. " Yah , by damn ! Or I go alone ! " " Then let 's test it all the way across first . " " Yah ! I do . " The old woman , bent upon showing what a lark it would be , swung lightly up onto the driftwood again . She walked the logs lightly , and found a handhold every yard or so . In two minutes she stood on the opposite shore , holding her arms up gaily and grinning . Then she hopped onto the driftwood again and came back . " You see ? " " But the horse . . " It is like a britch . " And so Mary gave in . She and Ghetel combined their strength to pull the horse down to the water 's edge . It did not want to go . It dug its hooves in on the bank and refused to step onto the logs . Mary looked into its panicky brown eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel panted . It would not.  | " Eh , then , ve shall see , " Ghetel growled . " You pull , May-ry . I put a stick up dis animal 's hinder and she vill go , ve see . " She got one of the hickory lances and went around behind the mare . Gently at first , then harder as the horse continued to balk , she jabbed at its rump with the point . The abject terror and pain in the mare 's eyes made Mary want to cry . But she talked to it and cajoled and encouraged and pulled at the neck-halter with one hand while hanging onto a limb with another . At last the mare yielded and took a step forward . She got a good footing on the log jam with her forehooves and , finding something under her , resisted a little less . But she was still very skittish . The water roaring underfoot was frightening her and Mary did not blame her . Ghetel roared a curse or command in Dutch and jabbed the hickory point straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mare gave up the shore and scrambled so suddenly onto the logjam that she almost knocked Mary off into the river . Now Mary inched backward along the logs , reaching back for handholds , pulling at the halter , trying to ignore the rush of the water below , the swaying and trembling of the driftwood jam under the horse 's weight . The animal was surprisingly sure-footed , and was coming along now . Whenever she stopped or threatened to panic , Ghetel would prod her on with the now bloody lance , and she would lunge forward a step . These quick moves were dangerous , but obviously the mare was not going to progress without them . They were midway across the jam now , with a mere fifteen feet to go . Suddenly , both the mare 's forefeet broke through the matted driftwood and into the water . She began neighing pitifully and throwing her head about . Her rump was high ; her chest rested on the logs . She strained with her rear haunches , trying to lift her forelegs up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind hoof slipped sideways off a log and poked through the debris , then the other hind leg plunged through on the other side of the log . A broken limb had penetrated her right side just behind the ribs ; it was impossible to tell how far . The mare was screaming , herp196chest resting on the drift with her legs in the water . The water under the horse was running with red stain . Mary cried encouragements to her , unconscious commands and entreaties , beginning to sob , hauling upward on the halter as if she could extricate the shrieking mare 's legs by sheer force of lifting . Ghetel stood on the logs behind the horse , her ugly face working with disbelief and anguish . She began shouting in Dutch . She dropped her lance and grabbed the horse 's tail and pulled up on it with all her might . The log jam trembled with their exertions and the steady pressure of the river 's flow . Limbs and logs shifted and groaned . " It 's going to break ! " Mary cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its piteous scream , and trying with futile spasms of movement to free itself . With each movement the wound in her side was torn wider and deeper . And now the old woman was climbing past the horse , motioning frantically at Mary as she came toward her . " Get off ! Get off ! " Mary turned away from the beloved beast and scrambled on all fours to the shore . She stood shaking and crying as Ghetel jumped to the ground beside her . She could n't look at the suffering beast now . She clapped her hands over her ears to shut out its pitiful cries . She looked at the ground and cried helplessly at this latest great loss . Ghetel stood making helpless gestures with her hands and looking back and forth between Mary and the horse . Finally she said , " Wait , " and climbed back onto the logjam and crept toward the animal . The mare suddenly fell still , as if trusting this person to come help her . She kept repeating a low , wet nickering deep in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the mare 's back . Then she started forward again , pausing beside the horse 's head to untie the halter and bell-rope . She brought these things , all their belongings , ashore . She closed a big hand firmly over Mary 's upper arm and started to propel her downstream away from the dying animal . Suddenly it began shriekingand tossing its head again . " Oh , stop it , stop it ! " Mary sobbed . " I ca n't bear it any more ! " They were a hundred yards down the east bank now but the horse 's cries were still audible over the rush of the river . Mary felt as if she would hear them when she was a hundred miles away.  |p197About  an hour 's walk downstream they stopped to rest . Mary felt ten times as weak as she had felt before . It was as if they had lost not only the horse 's own strength but also an equal amount of strength the horse , had given them just by being . They sat on a black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her face in her hand for a while and then turned a cold visage to Ghetel . " You are a stupid old woman . " Ghetel winced and glanced down , but then raised her eyes to Mary 's and reached over to pat her on the shoulder , saying : " Eh , now . No . Ve could not do any help . " Mary pulled away from the extended hand . After a moment , she said : " You told me you were going to listen to me when I feel some-thing . " Ghetel nodded . " Yah . " " But you would n't listen . " " Eh , now , May-ry . Forget dis . " Her voice was a little brusque now . She was sorry about the horse and she knew she was responsible and did not care to have the blame for that added to her present miseries . " You said right after I felt them Indians a-comin ' that you 'd listen to me from that time on . . . " Ghetel jumped up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eh ? " she roared . " Eh , May-ry Inkles ? I fink I listen to you too much already ! If I did not listen to you I vould be in a varm Indian house ! With a fire and a full belly ! " " Aye , y ' would be , eh ? A belly full o ' squash an ' dog meat , that 's what full of ! " " A belly full , anyway ! My stomach du n't care whether the meat said ' roff , roff ' or ' m0000 ' when it was alive ! " " Do n't it now ? " Mary snapped bitterly . " But it was ' ee cornplainin ' about th ' Indian victuals , not I. ' T was ' ee blatherin ' about all y'r fine kitchens an ' y'r fine Dutchy dinners an ' all . . . " And while Mary was railing on this way , falling back , as she did when upset , into her mother 's brogue , while she was pouring out all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman hadp198begun to pat her shoulder , and had sat down beside her on the log again . And when Mary 's invective had run down and some of the hurt had eased out of her breast , she became aware that her head was leaning on the old woman 's shoulder , and Ghetel was gently strokingdown her matted hair and saying , A gut girl now . A gut girl ' . And you 're all I haf in dis vorid , May-ry Inkles . All I haf. "  |p199THEY  ran out of corn . They ate the last of it on the O-y-o River bank at a place where the river course came down from the north and went a long way west . Mary recognized the place , even though the foliage of summer was now gone and the evening sky was full of marching black clouds instead of sunset : It was the place where the Indians had stopped to gaze down the broad valley and she had caught Captain Wildcat staring at her in that strange and smug way as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to tell Ghetel about it . Ghetel cared about nothing now but that they had eaten the last of their corn . They had detoured around two more rivers and two creeks since the one where they had lost the horse two days before . Now they sat looking down the great , slate-gray river and held their blankets over their heads and clenched tight at their throats to keep them from being blown off by the relentless wind . Finally , unsettled by Ghetel 's dark and lifeless stare , Mary ventured : " I know where we are . " She forced a smile . " We 're just about exactly halfway home , accordin ' to my reckonin ' . " Ghetel said nothing for a while . Then : " Eh . Half . " " Y 'd not 've thought we could come this far , would ' ee ? " " Nor go farder . " " Oh , yes . " She tried to be cheerful . She knew that Ghetel was now blaming her for their unspeakable circumstances , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every painful step they took and with every hollow twinge of hunger shep200felt , and that the resentment would surely only get worse from here on because food was getting to be almost impossible to find , . and within a day or two they would be leaving the relatively easy terrain of the O-y-o valley and turning up into the steep and boulder-strewn valley where the waters of the New River twisted through the towering mountains of the Allegheny range . " I reckon we 've walked all in all about three hundred fifty mile in less'n three weeks , " she went on . " Do n't that make ' ee feel some'at proud ? It does me , I 'll say as much ! " " Eh ! " " Come on , then . There 's still an hour o ' light . Then we 'll find us a nice cozy place out o ' this wind , an ' we 'll get all snug an ' I 'll do the kindness to y'r feet , eh ? What say'ee t ' that ? " She rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood leaning on her hickory spear . Under her blanket , in her knotted rope belt , hung the tomahawk . Its cold steel head against her naked flank made her shudder . But she did not want Ghetel to carry it . Since the loss of the horse , she had little faith in Ghetel . Ghetel would probably lose it , as she had lost her lance , and as she had lost them the horse . And they could not afford to lose the tomahawk . They simply would be out of all luck if they lost the tomahawk . She reached down . " Up , now , dear , " she said . Reluctantly , the surly old woman took the hand and groaned to her feet . Her gray face under the dark cowl of the blanket was full of hollows now , and in the gloom , with strands of wild , dirty white hair blowing over her face , she looked like a spectre , like a witch . The muffled bell hung on the strap around her neck . Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she 's reached th ' end of it all . A marvel that she can still get up . I 'm a-goin ' back t ' Will . There 's strength fr me in that . But what 's she got t ' look to , other'n a fat hot Dutch supper someday ? " That 's m ' good darlin ' , it is , " Mary encouraged , turning her and starting to lead her up the river bank . " Oh , I d'know what I sh 'd do without ' ee ! " They had not found a bite of anything edible by the next eveningand it was then that the old woman started talking about the horse . The sun had at last broken through the cold dark cloud-cover ,  |p201just  in time to glow like a dying campfire between the river bluffs downstream . It reflected in Ghetel 's eyes as she looked back down the river . She suddenly started spewing a stream of Dutch invective so bitter and unexpected that Mary stopped where she was and came back to stand in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes she looked like a madwoman . " What is this ? " Mary demanded . " Dat horse . How vas I so stupid ? " " Nah , nah , Ghetel . It 's a past thing . I 'm sorry too , but we tried and it failed . Do n't blame y'self . . . " The old woman was clenching her fist against her chin and the fist was trembling . " No ! I mean the meat ! The meat . " " What ? What meat ? " " The horse ! The horse ! " Mary blinked and stepped back . " Oh , no . Don ' say . . " " Ve should haf meat ! Dat horse dies . Ve should haf . .. " She made a sudden motion with her fist as if striking the poor beast between the eyes with a tomahawk . Then she turned to Mary with eyes ablaze . " Listen , " she hissed , and her mouth worked into a ghastly smile . " Gif me the ax , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary laid a hand on her wrist . The old woman 's arm was tense and trembling . Mary licked her lower lip and tried to figure out how to talk to her . This was a new kind of thing to deal with . " Dear , " she said , in a soothing way as if trying to teach something to a child , " now , we 've come three days a-walkin ' since that sorry day . We 've come along good , an ' I wager we 've done fifty miles . Now , we 're no such fools , you an ' me , as t ' go back fifty miles f'r a poor nag . Th ' buzzards ' as got ' er by now , anyway , if not a panther . . . " " All dat meat ! Gif me the little ax ; I go back . . . " She snatched suddenly at Mary 's blanket , tried to claw it open and get the tomahawk . Her hands were strong and she pulled the blanket away and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and got her hickory lance between her and Ghetel , stopping her . " And besides , " Mary continued , more firmly now , " we loved thathorse . She was our friend , give to us by God when we needed ' er . That 's why we never thought t ' eat ' er . Never even thought o n't . . . " Ghetel 's face set in a strange , cunning resignation . Wherever herreason was , she could comprehend that at this moment , Mary wasp202armed and she was not . But a shrewd little smile stayed on her face as she seemed to acquiesce . " Now if'n y ' see my way o ' thinkin ' , " Mary went on in a level voice , " kindly hand me back m ' blanket there , dear , as I 'm likin ' t ' freeze . .. " Ghetel gave her the blanket and Mary draped herself in it and smiled as if everything were nice and ordinary , but she stayed on her guard and kept the spear at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lee of a rock outcropping , and Mary massagedthe old woman 's feet for a long time . Then they rolled up in their separate blankets and about an hour later Mary went to sleep waiting for Ghetel to go to sleep . When Mary woke the next morning before dawn , the old woman was gone . She had taken her blanket and the tomahawk and Mary knew she had set out to go back fifty miles to butcher their old friend the horse . Mary knelt in her blanket for a few minutes , trying to figure out what to do . She was furious with the old woman , who had let the misery in her ' guts overpower the reason in her head and the nobility in her soul . For a moment Mary thought about simply forgetting the crazy hag and pressing on alone toward home . She still had her blanket and her spear . The loss of the tomahawk was a serious matter . But not having the old woman to feed and humor and contend with would give her much greater freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent , but she was erratic and sometimes threatening , and could not be depended on to act wisely . But for those very reasons , the old woman would surely get herself lost or killed or would go completely crazy running around in circles desperately seeking food . Mary imagined the old woman attacking a bear or something with the tomahawk to kill it for food and getting killed herself instead ; then she envisioned her getting lost and wandering alone in the forest screaming and mad . And then , having imagined this , there was nothing to do but get up and draw the blanket around herself and , using her spear as a walking stick , go back down the river and try to find Ghetel whilep203there was still a chance of finding her . It was terrible to go back even a step . But the main reason she had to go back was because it was unthinkable to proceed up into the dark mountains and roaring gorges and the cold , howling nights of the approaching winter without a companion . The sun was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the way up into the sky over the ridges , when Mary heard a strange moaning and mumbling nearby at her left . She had come perhaps three miles , and before her was the mouth of a creek they had circumvented the day before . Mary paused and held her spear aslant before her , and moved with stealth toward the sound . The leaves crushed loudly under her feet . At the edge of the creek bank she stopped and looked down . In her drab blanket , Ghetel was as colorless as the sere landscape and Mary would hardly have seen her but for the movement of her rocking . The old woman sat on an exposed sycamore root at the creek 's edge , rocking back and forth , groaning and talking to herself . The tomahawk lay on the ground a few feet away . Mary 's pity flooded out to the old wretch . Poor soul , she thought . Jus ' could n't face one o ' these creek walkarounds alone . Mary edged down the creek bank and picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman stopped crying and rocking and turned her face to Mary . It was wet with tears and snot and her nose was red . She showed no surprise at the sight of Mary . It was impossible to imagine where her mind was . Mary extended her hand . " Come , dear . Y ' been goin ' the wrong way . " However much or little the old woman comprehended , she apparently had forgotten about or given up hope of finding the horse . More important , she seemed to understand that she must follow Mary . Without Mary , the wilderness was utterly pathless and there was no such thing as direction . Mary was like a compass needle , steadily pointing toward somewhere , and if the old woman had learned anything in her morning alone it was the utter emptinessof having no guide . It was perhaps a worse emptiness than thatp204of hunger . And so Ghetel was compliant and followed Mary , followed her and stayed close , as they continued northward along the winter-gray O-y-o and came at last to the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary recognized it at once , despite the change the season had wrought . There was that wide river mouth coming down through the narrow but lush bottomland , between those steep and darkflankedmountains . There on the opposite side of the mouth was that spacious grove where they had camped , and where the medicine brave had made the hickory frame to carry the baby girl in . . . She put that thought of the baby out of her mind quickly and led Ghetel southeastward to the place where the Indians had hidden the canoes after coming across . It would be good if we could find a canoe , she thought . It was not that she wanted to cross the river here , particularly ; this side of the valley looked as easy to walk as the far side , and if they could stay on this bank for a while , they would have the river between themselves and the Indian road . But the river was broad and slow here , and going up it in a canoe would be a needed relief from walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to rest and heal . Also she knew that a canoe turned upside down on a river bank , with a deep bed of leaves under it , would make a good shelter against cold rains . November , according to her calendar of knots , was but a week or so ahead , and she knew what November could be like in the high and harsh Alleghenies . But here again she found no canoes . If there were any canoes at the mouth of this tributary , they were on the far shore and it was useless to think of them . She came back to the place where Ghetel squatted rocking on her haunches and gazing forlornly across the river mouth . " Eh , now , Ghetel . They 's no canoes here , so it 's time we get on our shanks an ' git . " The old woman shook her head slowly and extended a gnarled hand toward the river . " Vat use ? Ve nefer find a place to cross dis big ' tin . " " Ah ! But y ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have t ' cross this'n . We go up this'n all th ' way t ' home ! " Ghetel looked up at her as if this were beyond comprehension , orp205was perhaps just a ruse to get her on her feet . " Home , " she said low and flat , as if dismissing the word . " Aye ! Home ! Trust me now , dear . I know the way . " I hope I know the way , she thought , remembering the tortuous route along creeks and over ridges and game trails and under cliffs by which the Indians had brought her down . And interspersed among the memorized landmarks in her mind there were those blank spaces : the hours , sometimes whole days , when she had been so absorbed in grief and the pain of coming childbirth that she had not been able to observe the route at all . But I know the way . Far enough up this river , regardless of the shortcuts th ' savages carried me over , I 'll come to places I know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was telling the truth , " I sure do know the way . Come along . 0 ten times te  --  en times ten a  --  way . . . " And it made her voice sound so good that old Ghetel actually smiled as she unfolded her creaking bones and stood up.  |p206JOHNNY  DRAPER leaned close to Will Ingles and said in his ear : " This ' ere Snake Stick 's sour as gooseberry vinegar . Reckon whiskey 'd sweet ' im up a mite ? " Will looked at Snake Stick . The deep furrows in the Indian 's cheeks ran down beside and then under the downturned corners of his mouth , and there were two deep vertical creases between his brows . A man would have to frown for forty years straight to get such a grouchy set to his face as that , Will thought . " I don ' know , " he murmured to Johnny . " It could just as likely craze ' im an ' make ' im do what he 'd like to do to us . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick warned , his eyes looking even harder . " English talk straight to Snake Stick . " He thumped himself on his massive hard chest . Then he leaned forward , his face lighted from below by the little smokeless council fire . Twenty men of the village sat behind him , making a semicircle in the lodge , looking as if they were competing among themselves to appear as grim as Snake Stick , who now asked : " English say word whiskey ? " " Aye , " Will replied , thinking : Lordy , but they got a keen ear fr that word . " English give Snake Stick whiskey . " The chief seemed to be very intrigued that Will Ingles ' name sounded so much like " English , " and had been addressing him disdainfully as " English " since the white men 's arrival here this afternoon.  |p207Will  nodded and delved into the duffel pouch he carried slung by a strap over his shoulder , and brought out a pewter flask covered in leather . He pulled the stopper and handed the flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief reached for it that he had quite a weakness for it ; the Indian was trying to look casual but his cold eyes were suddenly blazing . He put it to his mouth and sucked hard on it , thus taking a lot of whiskey in what appeared to be a short swig . He might have been fooling his red comrades , but Will Ingles had watched men drink enough to know that Snake Stick had probably diminished the contents by a good third . The chief put the flask down on the floor in front of him and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand . His eyes were watering . He said : " English have more whiskey on horse ? " " That I have . " " Snake Stick could take it from English and English could not do anything to stop him , " the chief said with an arrogant half-smile . " No , " said Will . " Snake Stick could not . " The chief 's eyes narrowed hard . " English say no ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob a guest . I admire this in the red man . " The chief 's eyes fell and then came back to Will 's . " But English would give Snake Stick much whiskey , for his braves to drink . " With two turns of his head he indicated those who sat around him . " Yes , I 'd do that . . . if Snake Stick would promise to try to help me in this matter with the Shawnee . If not , then no . I 'll give whiskey to a Cherokee who 'll be my friend . " The chief blew a breath so boozy that Will envisioned it bursting into flame over the council fire , then picked up the flask and took another powerful pull . Christ 's good name , Will thought , I better get this heathen 's word in five more minutes , or ' e wo n't be fit to give it . And he was not entirely sure he could hang anything on Snake Stick 's honor anyway . It had been Will 's experience in life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as that of an amiable man . " English will bring whiskey for my men , " Snake Stick announced . " Gander Jack , " Will said to the guide without looking at him ,  | " would y ' trot out an ' fetch me one o ' them demijohns ? " He felt the guide rise and leave behind him . He heard the shuffling of many moccasins as Jack left , and realized that the darkness in the lodge behind him had been filling with people . People coming in very stealthily . And he knew too that they would not be coming in unless Snake Stick was permitting it . He fought down a shudder . This Cherokee seemed a treacherous wretch indeed , and Will admitted the possibility that he and Johnny , and maybe even Gander Jack , might well be enjoying the final confabulation of their careers . Jack returned with the demijohn . He put it on the ground in front of Will and looked at him with raised eyebrows , a signal whose particular significance Will could only guess at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will thought . I 'd sure like to confer with Jack here an ' see what ' e thinks . Will thumbed the wax off the jug 's neck and pulled the stopper . Snake Stick pointed to the jug and then to Will and Johnny and Jack . Will hoisted the demijohn with both hands and took a pull . Then Johnny took a long , gurgling drink , passed it to Jack and sighed , licking his lips . Jack then came forward and gave it to Snake Stick , who sampled it heartily and passed it to the brave on his right with some Cherokee talk that Will guessed to mean save some for me . The braves passed it around while Snake Stick 's black eyes flashed with volatile thoughts . The Cherokee 's eyelids drooped a little now , making his malevolentgaze look shifty . Will 's doubts about his trustworthiness increased . " English listen : Snake Stick is not happy you come here and ask this thing . " He swiped his hand downward . " Snake Stick will not be proud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Shawnee will say to Snake Stick , Why do you talk with English ? ' They will say , If you are so near English to talk , you should strike him . ' " " Then I reckon you would answer , Because the Cherokee are not at war with the English . ' " " They are not at this day , " Snake Stick grumbled . " Tomorrowyes . Snake Stick this day is at war with the English in his heart . " Will 's nostrils distended and he said : " I remind you that todayI 'm a guest in your lodge , and that y 're a guest in my jug , big feller , an ' I think we 'd do well as each other 's guest not to talk hostile . "  |p209Will  heard Gander Jack take a quick breath behind him , but he had borne about enough of Snake Stick 's insolence and it was hard to remain diplomatic . " If my whiskey makes Snake Stick snap like a cur dog , maybe I 'll just cut Snake Stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes flashed . But he was enough of a chief to understand the protocol of guests and hosts , and so contained himself . Gander Jack looked back and forth between them . He saw that Mr. Ingles had actually gotten away with that bold talk , and he looked at him with considerable respect . Still , the exchange had done anything but put him at ease . This was a formidable white man who could look and talk and act like one of those chiefs in the white man 's Bible , but he was in a place where one could be too formidablefor his own good . Will Ingles said now : " Even if you 're at war with English men in your heart , I hope you 're not at war with English women and children . Your Shawnee brothers killed the mother of my woman , and they killed my brother 's baby son . They took away my woman and my sons . I do not care what you feel in your heart about the English , but sure it 's no brave deed t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'r Shawnee brothers if their Great Spirit would smile on them for this . Ask ' em if the Frenchmen are better people than the English if they hire red men to make war on those who can not fight . " Snake Stick had glowered at Will Ingles through this , and now he put his hands on his thighs and took a deep breath and made ready to debate . He was gathering answers from back in his head , where the whiskey was working . " The French men do not fear the Great Spirit . The French men have medicine men of their Great Father . Wear black squawclothes . They forgive the Shawnee for what he must do in war . " " What in blue thunder is he talkin ' about ? " Johnny asked . " Priests , " Will said . " I heard Colonel Washington tell Jim Pattonabout ' em . The French make odd use of ' em . . . " " English not make low-talk , " the Cherokee warned again . " I was just a-sayin ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will said to Snake Stick . " You 'd do better to stay with your own . " The chief thought on this and chose not to argue it . He picked up the jug and took another deep swig.  | " You drink my whiskey , " Will said , " so I reckon you 're willin ' to talk business with me . " " English talk . " " Good , then . When you go up to your Shawnee brethren , if y ' please , ask after a woman named Mary Ingles  --  Mary Ingles  --  and her two little sons . And a woman named Bettie Draper . Bettie Draper . They were taken from a settlement near the upper  --  Jack , what is it they call the New River ? " " Chi-no-da-ce-pe . " " Chi-no-da-ce-pe , " said Will . " Far up by Blue Ridge . " " Mer English , " the chief said . " Mer English with two sons . And other woman . . . " " Bettie Draper . Can you remember those ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenard . I would buy him back too . " Snake Stick shook his head . " Not buy English man back . Shawneeat war with English men . " " Ask anyway . Henry Lenard was not a soldier . He was a hunter . " " A hunter can be a soldier . Not sell back . " " Let the Shawnee decide who they 'll sell back . I 'm only askin ' you to carry my offer , " Will said , trying to mask his impatience . " How much is English offer ? " " I 'll show you . " Will leaned forward on his crossed legs and stood up . " Jack , m'lad , help me bring in the packs . " They went out through the crowd of Indians , who parted to let them reach the door . The sky was starry and the air was crisp outside the lodge where the horses were tied . " How 're we doin ' , Jack ? " Will asked . He had been so scared at first that he 'd thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamned mean Indian had braved him up . He was almost having fun . " If he do n't kill us , we 're doin ' better than I 'd ' a ' thought , " Jack muttered . They unstrapped the packs and carried them into the lodge , and spread their goods out where Snake Stick could see them all . His warriors and chieftains crowded close around and admired the treasures . Their eyes were covetous but their faces remained closed . Will tried to look at the stuff from their point of view . He had invested everything he had in this junk . After a while the chief raised his eyes , and Will was sure he hadp211memorized every item , the brown liquor jugs in particular . " How much for Snake Stick to do this ? " he said . Will thought quickly . " All that lays on this blanket , " he said . " Or , all the whiskey in these . " " Snake Stick could take all this from English , not go to Shawnee . " Again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor of Snake Stick . And if you betrayed me thataway , all the Cherokee septs would soon know . ' Cause I 'd tell ' em of my disappointment , " " Dead English could tell no stories to Cherokees . " " I am your guest . " " After you leave Snake Stick 's town , you not guest . My braves could silence you . " " I reckon they could . But some of your braves would have to die to silence me . And the rest would know you lacked honor . You could never silence that . " Will was sweating inside his clothes . He knew such talk was dangerous , but he felt that boldness , not timidity , was the only answer to Snake Stick 's taunts , or threats , or whatever they were , He does n't intend to do such a thing anyway , or he 'd be a fool to talk about it , Will thought . He 's just a-testin ' my resolve and my wits . " If Snake Stick take all this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mer English and Bettie Dra-pah ? " " Then you bring it all back here and send for me , and we 'll talk again . " He was banking on the hope that this Cherokee would be persuasive on his behalf , rather than haul all this up to the O-y-o country and back in vain , or simply do nothing and make himself a rich man . However well or badly Snake Stick might do , Will could see that this transaction would take until next summer at least . His dear ones well might have been killed or lost or ruined by then . They might be lost beyond all findin ' already , he thought . Or changed beyond all redemption . But y ' ca n't let yourself think like that , he told himself . Y ' ca n't do a thing without faith . Even if havin ' faith is just a matter of foolin ' y'rself as long as y'can.  |p212MARY  sat on frosty ground and stared at the bright colors of her toes . They were the only colorful things she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . The colorful toes glowed through her lassitude and held her attention . They were gray-blue with bruises and there was bright red blood oozing out around her toenails . Ghetel 's feet were the same . Now that they had entered this valley , the luxury of walking through the level , grassy , leaf-strewn O-y-o bottomlands was a memory . Here every mile they walked was a gauntlet designed to bruise and abrade their heels and ankles and cut their soles and stave their toe-bones . The bottomlands and creekbeds were littered with boulders and splintered logs , jumbled stones and pebbles , the rock debris and forest trash that had been sliding down the mountainsidessince Creation . They had not eaten anything for four days except a handful of acorns they had found under an oak at the top of a bluff they had climbed to shortcut a bend in the river . They had made several such shortcuts . Perhaps they had saved themselves as much as five miles altogether , but in their weakened condition it seemed that they had added five vertical miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rocks and shrubs , pausing every twenty feet or so to hug the slopes and breathe against the ground until they could raise the strength to go on a few more feet . Then , after resting a few minutes on the ridges with thep213raw wind whipping them , they would start down the opposite slopes , more sliding than walking , slamming into tree trunks and stone outcrops , slashing and bruising their flesh and tearing their dresses . Now even their precious blankets were growing tattered at the edges , and had snag-holes in them . Ghetel had falled into a profound and gloomy silence in these last two days , speaking only to answer direct questions and sometimes not even then . Now Mary looked up from her own pulsating , stinging , aching feet and glanced over at the old woman , who was contemplating her own . Suddenly Ghetel turned her head and caught Mary 's eyes with a malevolent stare and there was a tremblinggrimace contorting her mouth . " I listened to you , " she said . Ah , Lord above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive got to try to cheer the old thing up yet again . " Aye , dear , " she said , forcing a benign smile . " Y 've listened to me , an ' we 've come more'n three hundred miles with no hurt t ' speak of , eh ? " " I hurt . " " Eh , well . I feel same as you , not m ' very best ever . But I 'm whole , an ' y 're the same . An ' damn'ee , we 're no squaws . Keep in mind , Ghetel m ' darlin ' , we 're free as birds ! " Ghetel looked incredulous at this cheery lecture . Finally she said , indignantly : " Free as birds ? Eheh ! You know how free is a bird ? Alvays a bird goes here for a seed , and he goes dere for a gnat . And dat 's all he does in his whole day ! And he nefer yet gets enough . So dere for your freedom of a bird ! Hah ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's brain was still alive after all ! She grinned into Ghetel 's wrinkled scowl . " Well , y'see then ! We really are as free as birds , then , ai n't we ? " And Ghetel , after scowling for a moment , actually laughed . It was a little miracle . They had come to recognize hickory , walnut and oak trees from a distance , and would go to them if they were accessible . The season for berries and wild grapes was past , but there were still nuts to be found  --  sometimes.  |p214Now  they were toiling up a steep , rock-studded slope toward a pair of likely looking hickories , a few yards above the river , whose shaggy bark made them conspicuous . Mary had given Ghetel her pointed lance to use as a walking-staff , as the old woman seemed to need its support more than she did . As they climbed , their breath was shallow and harsh and their feet dragged through the rustling leaves on the slope . It was a dry morning , without wind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress and the wet murmur of the river below , a vast silence filled the valley . The winter-stripped trees were stark , and without foliage to screen it , the hard angularity of the terrain was forbidding : mountainsides tilting skyward , V-shaped ravines full of mossy boulders and detritus , huge fallen tree trunks strewn like jackstraws on the slopes and in the gullies or sometimes leaning half-fallen , hung in the branches of other trees . Some of the mountain ridges ended abruptly in sheer gray rock cliffs facing over the river . From some of these rock faces , water seeped and dribbled and darkened the rock , and in places , mountain springs and freshets would simply spew over the ramparts of such cliffs into space , disintegrating to mist before reaching the valley floor . When Mary and Ghetel reached the hickories they found that squirrels had been working there before them . The ground below the trees was covered with husk-quarters and a few broken , yellowbrownnutshells , but most of the nuts were gone and the few that remained were marked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutmeats . The two women scratched over the leafy slope for fifteen minutes for a yield of a dozen good nuts . Like most of their recent disappointments , this gave Ghetel an excuse to glower in silent accusation at Mary . They sighed and sat down on a lichen-mottled slab of limestone , to break the nutshells and get to the tiny breakfast within . Mary pulled the tomahawk from her belt and , before she could crack the first nut , Ghetel said : " Gif me the ax . " " Mmm ? Well , wait , I will . . . " Now . Me first . " Mary shrugged , and started to hand it to her , to humor her as she had done so often recently , when a sudden caution turned in thep215back of her mind . Ghetel already had the hickory spear , and if Mary gave her the tomahawk too , the unhappy old woman would be in possession of both their weapons . Mary hesitated . She was surprised by the thought , by what seemed an unwarranted suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not shake off that strange whisper of dread . " Gif me , " Ghetel said . " Ahm , would y'give me the spear there first ? " Mary asked , as nonchalantly as she could . " W'y vant dat ? " " Because I , uhm , I want t ' poke about in the leaves and see if I can find a few more nuts . This is scarce enough t ' keep a bird alive . " She offered the little bird joke to try to gauge Ghetel 's frame of mind . But the old woman 's eyes only narrowed and she held out her hand for the tomahawk . Mary held out her hand for the spear , and for a moment they sat there like that , the tentative uneasiness hanging between them , until Mary began to fancy that , even if this dread were only a product of her imagination , Ghetel could surely read it and get the idea of having both weapons , even if she had not been thinking of it before . " Give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight throat it almost came out a whisper . She chose to call it the stick , not the spear , lest she betray her fears . " Ach ! Like a child ! " Ghetel sighed , and picked up the stick and extended it to Mary . Point first , Mary noticed . And when she closed her hand around the stick , Ghetel closed her hand around the tomahawkhandle . They exchanged them simultaneously . Am I imagining all this ? Mary wondered . If so , then indeed I must seem childish to ' er . And as Ghetel bent over her hickory nuts with the tomahawk , Mary , with the familiar spear shaft in her hand , remembered the strange ghastly feeling she had had watching Ghetel tear off the little arms of the frog . I 'm a-gettin ' too spooky , she thought . I 'm a-gettin ' feelings I need n't . All the same , she resolved as she scratched among the leaves with the stick , looking for more nuts while keeping Ghetel in the corner of her eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-gonnap216cut me one o ' these hickory saplin 's hereabout an ' make another spear . The overcast sky that afternoon was swept a shimmering blue by a northerly breeze . The last rags of the sun-washed clouds disappeared up the valley , and the towering landscape , ridge after ridge , brightenedfrom the colors of lead and pig-iron to silver and brass . The leafless trees were engraved in clarity : white and tan limbs , blueblackshadows . Cliff faces a mile away showed their flinty details as if they were close enough to touch . The women were picking their way over the shingle at a river bend , gingerly placing each step of their bleeding feet among the rocks , when they heard a small clatter off to their left toward the river 's edge and looked up and saw the fawn . He was a little white-tail , a few months old , no bigger than a large dog but walking high on his stilt legs away from them , looking back over his shoulder at them , as much in curiosity as fear . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water 's edge . Both women at once seemed to realize that they had him cornered on the point , being between him and the woods ; they heard each other gasp and whisper and each saw the other turn the point of her spear toward him . Mary could actually feel her little reserves of strength rushing to readiness in her breast and arms . Her hurting feet were nothing now as she turned toward the creature , staring unblinking at him . This was their greatest stroke of fortune yet . A hundred times more wonderful than a cold catfish lying on a creekbed . This creaturecould feed them red meat for a week or more . His hide could make moccasins . In her mind Mary was already building a fire , risk or no risk , to cook their first meal , to cure the rest of the flesh for food to eat along the way . She held the spear-pole with both hands , angling it forward from her right hip . Instinctively , she and Ghetel were moving in concert , slowly closing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to flee between them or around them . The fawn stopped at the water 's edge now , and turned its left flank to them , its face toward them as if it were watching one of them with each limpid brown eye . Its glistening black nose trem/bled as it tried to identify them by scent . Doubtless they were the first human beings it had ever seen . It still did not seem to have become afraid ; it stretched its neck toward Ghetel , who was now ten feet from it . Mary was closing in on its flank . Another yard , she thought , and I can strike . Her hands were shaking and she was almost nauseated by her desire to feel the lance plunge into that soft hide of brown and black . She heard a clatter of rock behind her , and at the same instant the fawn looked in that direction , seemed to comprehend its danger . It contracted an inch suddenly as its legs tensed for flight . Mary lunged desperately at the fawn with her spear , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive was running past her toward the fawn . Pain slammed through her knees and hip and arms as she fell on the rocky shingle . Hooves were clicking in the stones a few feet away and Ghetel was roaring something , and then the hooves rattled up the shore and away and something hard skittered along the rocks in that direction . Mary opened her eyes and looked back over her shoulder to see the fawn and a doe , its mother , springing like jackrabbits down the shore and then out of sight up a wooded slope . Ghetel 's thrown spear slid to a stop among the rocks behind them . Mary put her face against the pebbles and winced and sobbed and waited for the physical pain to go away . She knew from her cold and empty feeling and from Ghetel 's abandoned howls of frustration that the pain of their failure would be with them much longer than this of the stone bruises . " Ah , Ghetel , this looks t'be a lovely , fat an ' juicy ' un ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feast for a kink ! " Mary was holding up a brown stalk she had pulled from the mud at the water 's edge . Mud-clots and water dribbled from the gray root . Ghetel had just torn some nameless scrub-plant from between two rocks and was brushing dirt off its reddish-brown taproot . They had been acting this way , desperately silly , since their failure to kill the fawn . For a few hours after its escape they had wailed and prayed and fallen into silent rages of frustration . Then , as if freed from any more hope of getting meat to eat , they had been swept with a wave of giddy cheerfulness  --  even Ghetel  --  and hadp218returned to foraging for anything that grew within reach , whether they knew it was edible or not . They had stopped at every bush that had large winter buds , and had picked off handfuls of the buds and eaten them like nuts as they stumbled along . It was like eating wood , though often more bitter . Some of the buds were too hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soften a mouthful of them in their saliva until they could chew them apart and swallow them . And they would pretend to each other this way that they were indescribablysucculent and delicious . It was a dismal joke , but it was a joke and they would repeat it and repeat it and break out in high , wild laughter , the steep mountainsides echoing the laughter . Then there had come a time when they could not bear to chew another dry , tough bud , and they had remembered arrowleaf tubers . They could not find any arrowleaf stalks along these swift waters , but they began to see every sedge and cattail as a banner signaling the location of some succulent root or tuber below . They began pulling up whatever the ground would let loose of , and chopping out stubborn roots with the tomahawk . Then they would wash the dirt off the roots and rhizomes they had gathered , and continue upstream , mincing on their bruised and lacerated feet , making desperatelyhigh-spirited remarks about the delicacy of what they were eating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some were crisp and could be snapped between the fingers like turnip flesh , and easily chewed , tasteless or bitter or spicy in flavor . Others , no matter how promising their shape or color , were nothing but wood . Some of these woody ones , however , had soft and palatable bark that could be gnawed off before the root was thrown away . And others , they found , had tough and stringy bark that was bitter and inedible , but inside the bark there would be a whitish or yellowish core with the consistency of a potato or onion . The tomahawkwas indispensable to the task of digging these and getting to the flesh of them . The women were spending perhaps two hours of every day on their hands and knees , going nowhere , digging and chopping and peeling roots and snapping off buds . The tomahawk blade grew nicked and blunt and less useful . Mary experimentedp219with different kinds of stone and finally learned to identify the kinds that would whet steel . And so she was able to keep an edge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more a weapon , it 's a tool  --  despite its rough usage . Every time she would pull up a new root or pull down a withered berry and start to put it in her mouth , she would think fleetingly : pray this'n 's not poisonous . She had heard the menfolk talk about poisonous plants and berries and leaves , and she herself knew preciouslittle about them . She would simply look at one a moment , and if she got no forebodings , she would try to eat it . She had learned to trust her forebodings . And anyhow , she would think , the big poison of all is to have nothin ' , nothin ' , nothin ' whatsoever in th ' belly . Poison or no , this diet included many things not intended for human innards , and the women were afflicted by a succession of fluxes and blockages , nauseas and intoxications they had never experienced before . One day both of them began vomiting helplessly , spewing up green fluid and undigested plant fiber , until they were empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak to get to their feet . They hardly slept at all that night , a night of cold moon and shimmering frost on the ground , owl-hoots flutingamong the mountaintops , disturbed every few minutes by the sudden explosive spasms of their own retchings . By the next morning they were feverish and yellow-faced and covered with cold sweat , but the spasms had moved deeper , now clutching at their bowels until they would double over in agony and pray to die . By that afternoon they were stopping every few yards to excrete scalding gray waters . Then even that went dry while the need continued . Mary would stop , not hearing Ghetel 's footsteps behind her , and would look back to see the old woman squatting on the trail redfaced , groaning as if in childbirth , trying to pass something that would not move . Then it would be Mary 's turn to squat and strain without success . And then there came the trouble with seeing . The river would suddenly turn black ; cliffs would turn yellow . Mary would see two Ghetels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness with blazing white edges ballooned out of the ground in front of Maryp220and swallowed her with a rush of noise  --  hissing and voices  --  and then left her standing , weaving , in a landscape piercing white and shadowless as if illuminated by lightning . And then these things , or some of these things , would cure themselves , and the women would be lucid and even-tempered again for a while , and would try to determine which of the roots or berries or buds had poisoned them , so that they could avoid them next time . But of course they had no way of knowing , as they had tried anything they could chew and swallow , so they were doomed to be overcome every few days by the same afflictions . Despite all these miseries , Ghetel seemed to be having a resurgenceof that brave good humor that had first incited Mary 's admirationon the day of the running of the gauntlet . Mary studied her from time to time and marveled . It 's almost more than I can bear at my age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least . Once the old woman must have been quite fat . Mary had noticed , when first seeing her at the Shawnee town , that her frame was massive and her flesh was loose as if she had lost perhaps thirty or forty pounds of fat between the time of her capture and the time of her arrival at the Indian village . Now there was nothing massive about her any more . She was burning her flesh up from inside . She was a framework of heavy bones draped with a hide that once had been full and now was empty . Wrinkled folds of flesh hung from her arms like thrums on the sleeve of a hunting coat . Her breasts drooped like empty wallets and the skin of her legs bagged and wrinkled at the knees and ankles like hose ten sizes too big . Her shanks were covered with running sores . Her nails were split and broken and caked with black dirt . Her unruly white hair was matted with twigs and leaves and filth , and much of it was coming out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had scratched constantly at lice , and from the end of her nose there perpetually hung a string of snot . Her eyes were sunk in wrinkled red pouches and her face was cadaverous . Somewhere once quite long ago , Mary had seen a face that looked like this , and she had been trying to remember where , and now suddenly with an awful jolt she remembered : In Philadelphia when she was a little girl , in the cellar of a house nearby , neighbors had discovered the body of a derelictp221woman who had crawled in there and died as much as a month before . Mary , with other children of the neighborhood , had had a horrified glimpse of the corpse as it was brought out to the dead wagon . It could have passed for Ghetel 's twin . Yet here was this wretch , looking fully like a cadaver that would not lie down ; here in this roaring huge wilderness , in this valley where surely no white human had ever been before , except Mary and her fellow captives last summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at this moment on a boulder tearing strips of cloth from the rags of her dress to wrap around her feet , still trying to take care of herself . The old muffled horse-bell still hung useless from her neck like a pendant . " Ah , " the old woman said , looking at her new footgear and then turning to smile at Mary . " Now I make a pair for you , eh ? " Mary choked back a sudden swollen ache in her throat , and the old hag-face shimmered beyond a film of tears . " Thankee , yes , Ghetel . Yes , God lov'ee ! " Mary stopped , aghast . She stood there leaning on her spear , an awful panic of confusion building up in her . In their way lay a river mouth . It came out from between two mountains swift and deep , and swirled into the river they had been following . It was not just another river course to be detoured ; worse , it was a river that did not exist among the succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the opposite bank for that whitish beach that would be the salt lick where she and Bettie and Henry had camped and worked on the way down . That salt lick was supposedto be her next landmark . She had not noted a river here . " Vat ? " asked Ghetel , who had stopped beside her . I ca n't tell ' er . I must n't tell ' er I think I 've got us lost . She 'd kill me sure . " Vat ? " Ghetel repeated . " Oh , m'dear . Just another tiresome walk-around , is all . " She forced herself to smile . " But we sh 'll make quick work of it , sha n't we ? Sha n't we , old friend ? By now we sure know what t ' do aboot rivers in our way , do n't we ? " And so they turned south and west , though the compass in herp222head said south and east . And as they climbed over cold mossy boulders and snarls of driftwood , she ransacked her memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrong turn ; she tried to keep from lying down and giving up . The dark swift water rushed by , almost beneath their feet . Mary looked down into it with a dreadful longing . She was thinking how simple and quiet it would be , how easy it would be to terminate this infinity of miseries , to find eternal rest from this struggle , to take one step sideways off this rock , into this nameless river.  |p223AS  if reflecting her somber doubt , this canyon blackened as they climbed , crawled and hobbled up its twisting course among the mountains . Much of the rock debris underfoot was black , and there were wide strata of gleaming black rock along the cliff faces . A heavy overcast had ended the spell of bright cold weather , deepening the gloom of the valley , dulling the details of the forests . The water looked like ink . Ghetel 's brief period of good humor seemed to be guttering out like a candle under the influence of this hellish gorge and Mary 's own dark preoccupation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rasping breath , the sliding and grinding of shale and rock underfoot , the ominous , hollow rushing of the dark river and the moan of the wind in the trees high on the hillsides . The leaves had fallen out of Ghetel 's beloved bell , and now it clunked dismally as they struggled along . I just do n't remember this black valley , Mary told herself time after time . If I 'd come by it once I 'd not have forgot it . I remember a valley farther up where the stone was blue . But I do n't remember this black valley . I 'm sure I 've never been by this black valley ! She kept watching the opposite shore for sight of the salt spring . Surely we 'd ha ' come to th ' salt spring by now . Surely . If n we were on the proper river . Once her heart leaped when she saw a line of white at the shoreline in a riverbend ahead . There , she thought , wanting to shout it , there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw that it was not a whitep224beach , but the swift white water of a riffle . The shores were relentlessblack and gray . She sank to the ground and re-tied on her feet the strips of cloth , which had grown pitch black . " What a bleedin ' dirty place , " she muttered , looking up at the crumbling black cliff at their backs . " Have y ' ever seen th ' like ? " " Yah . Coal , is all . " " Oh , aye ! But it is , ai n't it ? " She had seen coal in Philadelphia , but only in wagons , on the way to hearths . She had never thought of it making up mountains . " But you can not eat coal , " Ghetel said . " Ghetel , leave me be awhile . I have t ' think . Go look f'r victuals . Something . But leave me be . " Mary sat for a long time on the rock , pondering . She shut her eyes and made herself concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate on landmarks and their sequence as she rememberedthem , and tried to separate from them all the disorientation she had been suffering since entering this valley of coal . She put her mind far back to the day of the massacre at Draper 's Meadows and came day by day through her memory down the New River , the fording places the Indians had used , the burning spring , the salt lick , to the O-y-o , past its tributaries to the Shawnee town , on down to the ' salt lick of the big bones , and then started back up . She studied on each landmark until her head ached , trying to imagine where she could have made a mistake that would have lost the New River . She would think until she was dizzy , then would breathe deep and think some more . And finally , after more than an hour , she opened her eyes . There was only one explanation , and it calmed her and made her peaceful inside : There was no way they could be lost . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be anything else . This coal river was just another tributary . The only reason she could not remember it was that somehow she had not seen it as the Indians were bringing her down . Somehow she had failed to notice it , and that was why it had appeared so shockingly , so unexpectedly , today , and thrown her into such a whirl of confusion . It was just another tributary that , like the others , they must cross when they could and then descend on the other side to regain the New River.  |p225She  saw Ghetel sitting on a log nearby , rocking back and forth with her arms folded over her belly , looking at her . " You prayed ? " " Aye , after a fashion , " said Mary . " I too prayed . " " Good . Now let 's us cross this river . " They went in gasping with the shock of the cold , there at the riffle . It was the only shallow place they had seen , and although the water was alarmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very impatient to get across it and back down to what she was now sure was the New River . She was beginning to feel that if she slept a night up in this black valley she would never get her sense of direction straightened out thereafter . The spear-poles helped . With them , they sounded the rocky bottom that they could not see , and they leaned on them when the current pushed hard against their bodies . They prayed all the way across . They got back down to the river mouth before dark . Mary guessed they had walked some eight miles up and eight miles down that gloomy gorge . Those miles , and the strain and effort of wading the cold river , had so weakened them that they were forced to sit and rest every ten minutes or so by the day 's end . There was no light left by which to search for food . Their blankets were still damp from the crossing and from two or three brief rain showers that had fallen during their descent through the canyon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the stony passage of the day . Both women were further weakened by the scouring bowels that had been draining their vigor for days . And now with dusk came a slow , steady rain that promised to continue much of the night . Mary hurt in every joint , and her heart seemed to be fluttering more than beating . A few feet above the river mouth they found the hulk of a great beech tree that had long since fallen . Its center was rotted out , leaving a cavity some three feet wide , floored with the soft punk of decay and drifted leaves . Mary jabbed into the cavity several times with her spear , both fearing and hoping that it might be serving as some animal 's lair . Then they dragged themselves in , rolled intop226each other 's arms for warmth with the blankets wound around them and passed out to the hiss of rain . In the night a pair of gray foxes , one carrying a dead partridge , trotted to the log , smelled the intruders , bristled , skulked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening , then turned and left to find other quarters , their damp bushy tails low over the ground , taking their partridge with them . Oh , heavenly God , she 's dead . " Ghetel . Ghetel ! " She shook the old bony shoulder violently . The old woman did not respond . In the snug worm-eaten hollow of the log , enveloped by the smell of decay , it was too much like being in a coffin . Then Ghetel rolled onto her back and groaned , and exhaled a rank breath into Mary 's face . She began to stir , then sank back into torpor . Mary hugged her . She 's not dead . But she 's ready to lie here and die . Mary raised herself painfully onto an elbow . Daylight outside the end of the log showed only a stretch of ground covered with wet dead leaves . But she could hear , in the hiss of rain and the drummingof the rivers , all that hopeless wild inhospitable space out there . And within the fastness of this log it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound a sleep before . It would be so nice just to lie here and not wake up , ever , she thought . One could die quite nice here . She closed her eyes and listened to the hush . But then she opened her eyes . She needed to make water . And besides , she could n't just up and die . Will was waiting for her to come home . She could n't make Ghetel move . So she strained and pulled and dragged her own blanket free and wriggled out into the dank , rainy air , drew her blanket over her head , and stood shivering , legs apart , pissing , looking around . The dark river was high and fast . It had risen to a level within a few feet of the log . We might well ' a ' been swept into th ' river , she thought with a strange , bemused indifference , an ' back down to th ' O-y-o . An ' lost all that ground we 've gained so hard . But o ' course we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She staggered listlessly down to the bank of the New River , her feet chilled by the wet leaves , the filthy rags of her footclothsp227dragging , and stood there looking upriver for landmarks . The river was gray-green , more than half a mile wide , sizzling with rainspatters , rushing down the V-shaped valley . The iron-gray mountainsidesslanted up , their summits out of sight in the rainclouds . The whole valley looked as forbidding and hellish as the coal valley had seemed yesterday . And what nagged her was that it looked no more familiar . Surely we 'd have come to the salt lick by now , , she thought , if we was really on the right river . No , damn ' eel Do n't admit them doubts again . She closed her eyes and swayed . She heard the horse bell . Ghetel was up and moving , then . God , I 'm empty . She reached inside the blanket and ran her hand over her belly . It was swollen hard now , as when it had contained the baby . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been flat , even hollow . Now it was so full of emptiness that it was bloated . What is that smell ? It grew stronger as she went toward the river 's edge . " May-1y . " Ghetel came alongside , waddling and staggering , clutching her filthy blanket about her and carrying her spear . And then Mary saw it . The river had cast it up amid the shore drift : a doe 's head , considerably decomposed , its eyes milky , tongue gray . It had been neatly cut off just behind the skull , cast away , perhaps , by Indian hunters upstream . Shuddering , Mary bent and picked it up by grasping one of its cold , wet ears , and carried it up toward the beech log . Ghetel walked beside her , staring at it . Mary put it on top of the log , as if setting a table , and drew the tomahawk out of her belt . " It 's putrid , " she said . " Yah . " " Hope it do n't sicken us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin slid off the slimy meat easily . There was flesh on the jaw muscles . It was pasty white , a little blue , even , and they almost gagged as they chewed it . There was n't much else but the tongue . Mary got it loose and threw away the rest of the head so she would n't have to see the eyes . She split the stinking tongue lengthwise and gave half of it top228Ghetel . They sat down on opposite sides of the log to eat , as neither could stand to watch the other eating offal . The stench of the rotten head was still in their nostrils and hands and clothing that afternoon when they passed opposite the mouth of another large river that flowed into the New from the east . It looked familiar , though Mary was beginning to suspect that winter had changed the aspect of everything so completely that she might never recognize another landmark against the ones she had engraved in her memory . And if so , she thought , then we sh 'll just have to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her , and Mary felt a rush of sympathy for her . On faith alone , she thought . That 's all poor Ghetel 's been a-travelin ' on this whole way . " Dem deers , " Ghetel said at twilight as they were inching their way over rain-slick rock slabs at the river 's edge . " Oh , all dem deers ! I want ' em ! " " Eh ? " Mary stopped and looked back . Ghetel was pointing toward the opposite shore . There at the river 's edge a quarter of a mile away there were three white-tail bucks and two does , their heads down as if grazing . Mary felt her hand tighten instinctively on the shaft of her spear-stick and wished she could be on that side of the river . I 'd get one , she thought . I swear I 'd get one and we 'd make a fire an ' roast it so nice .. . And then she noticed something . The deer were all licking at the beach . And the beach was pale , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ghetel ! " she whispered intensely . " It 's th ' salt lick ! " Her heart frolicked inside her ribs . " Vat 's ? " " The salt lick ! Ghetel ! I know just where we be ! " " I fought you alvays know dat . " " Aye , but . . . " Two of the bucks had raised their head and were looking across the river . They had heard the voices . They were alert , beautiful , tinyp229at this distance , the enormous dark mountainside rising a thousand feet into the clouds behind them . Ghetel raised her spear over her head and shouted : " You ! I could eat you raw ! " " You raw ! You raw ! " the mountainside echoed . They found shelter under a shelf of rock stratum twenty feet above the river that night . It was not quite a cave ; it was perhaps three feet from floor to ceiling at its entrance and six feet deep into the cliff . The dry floor was littered with sticks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fragment of a clay pot near the back . A charred flat stone on the floor and soot on the ceiling showed that somebody , however long ago , had enjoyed a fire . At one end , Mary found a scattering of cracked turkey or duck bones and some flakes of flint , including two sharp but broken arrowheads . Dast we try a fire ? Oh , she thought , how I should love t ' look in a fire after all this lonesome cold an ' gray ! She shaved a fistful of tinder from a stick with the edge of the tomahawk , stacked twigs near at hand , and knelt , shivering , over it with the tomahawk in her left hand and a piece of flint in her right . She struck several sharp , glancing blows against the steel with the flint . But the flint was so small and light that she could produce only a spark or two . She exchanged it for another scrap of flint but it was even smaller . The sparks flew like little stars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tinder . After a while , breathing hard , cursing , knuckle and thumb smarting and bleeding , she gave up and sat back on her haunches , all but crying with frustration . " Well , I reckon we 're just not meant . .. " " Hssssst ! " Ghetel was peering out into the twilight , listening . And then Mary heard it : a syllable in human voice from across the river through the hush of rain , and shortly after , another and another , and the clatter of hooves . Words were indistinguishable , but the inflections of the voices left no doubt that Indians were passing on the opposite shore . Maybe her imagination was tricking her , but in the murky gloom over there she thought she saw figures moving downstream among the tree trunks . After a while the sounds were swallowed up by the rain and the river but the two women huddled motionless for some time longer.  |p230And  when they rolled into their blankets , she gave a prayer of thanks to the same Providence she had been cursing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignite a fire . They left the cave early the next morning , too cold and hungry to sleep past dawn . They went flinching along the stony river bank for five minutes , their aching-cold feet punished unbearably by each step , their stiff toes seeming to stub on every rock . Finally Ghetel stopped and sat on a log , saying , " No , no , no . Gif me de ax . " Mary hesitated . " Come , come . Gif , " Ghetel insisted , putting her palm up and wagglins hgr fingers for it . She took ' ' W ' ' a ) nd bent down to a leatherwood shrub and deftly scored a branch and stripped off several strands of bark . Then she tore four large rectangles of cloth from the remains of her skirt . Mary sat and looked on , curious . The old woman worked , talking to herself , her breath condensing in the bitter air . Every few minutes she had to stop and put her stiffened fingers between her thighs to warm them . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant hunger , her blood seemed more and more sluggish , her heartbeats more feeble and uneven , and her extremities seemed to be getting no blood at all to warm them . It was , she thought , as if her heart were trying to pump cold sorghum instead of blood . Ghetel raked a pile of dry leaves onto each of the pieces of cloth . Then she placed her right foot on one of the piles , drew the edges of the cloth up around her ankle , and tied a strip of bark around the ankle . She did the same then with the other foot , so that she now had , in effect , a bag of leaves bound around each foot , " Now you , " Azshe said . Mary was touched ; her eyes brimmed as she watched the miserableold creature kneel at her feet and struggle with her gnarled and benumbed fingers to knot the stubborn bark . She helped her rise , and smiled at her . The old woman grinned broadly , quite pleased with herself . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to walk carefully to keep from snagging or loosening the makeshift shoes , and had to stoop and retie them often , and replace the crushed leaves , but the waxy tth and cushioning were luxuriou ' and Mary turned often to Ghetel with smiles and sighs and happy head/shakes to express how much she appreciated them . This in turn kept the old woman much more genial than she might have been otherwise . Mary saw the flames first . For a moment she was baffled by the sight of yellow-orange fire billowing out of the riverbed a mile ahead . Then she remembered . She stopped and pointed at it . Ghetel looked up from her careful negotiation of the rocky shore and her eyes bugged . Delight and then fear passed rapidly over her features , then she hung onto Mary 's arm and looked to her for explanation . Mary told her about the odorous air that bubbled from the mud , and how the Indian had ignited it . " Must be them Indians we heard last night thrown a brand into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They found a rock ledge directly across the river from the burning spring , and brushed up a thick pile of leaves under it . Then they foraged up and down a nearby ravine for two hours . They were uncommonly lucky , and brought in half a pound of acorns , eight walnuts and a handful of wildflower bulbs that looked something like wild onion . Almost gleeful , they huddled in their blankets against the biting cold , gazed across the broad river at the cavorting pillar of flame and its reflection on the water and ate their variety of victuals as a purple dusk gathered . " Odd . We wanted a fire so last night . Now here we jus ' wait a day an ' , I be blessed , we got one . Hum ? " It was too far away for them to feel any of its heat , of course . But as the nourishment from their repast stole out into their limbs and owls hooted and wolves wailed among the mountains , they gazed at the flames long into the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least were warmed by the sight of the distant fire.  |p232SOMETIME  in the long , cold hours after midnight , the wind strengthened and backed into the northwest . It began moaning up the valley , rattling the millions of bare branches . Then it gusted suddenly to a gale strength , shrieking along the steep mountainsides , sweeping leaves off the ground , flinging a hail of broken twigs through the forest and blowing down shallow-rooted trees . Mary and Ghetel were jolted awake by the ripping and snapping and thudding of great limbs and tree trunks , and in terror clutched at their blankets , which the icy wind threatened to tear from their bodies as it scoured all the leaves of their bedding out of their alcove and pelted them with flying debris . They huddled together , squinting . Across the river , their friendly pillar of flame from the burning spring leaped and ducked and fluttered horizontally over the water before the force of the wind , then with a pouf was blown out . They sat clinging to each other in the howling darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , trying to keep their blankets tight around their shoulders and anchored under their feet . There was no such thing as sleep now , just shivering and waiting , clutchingeach other when some huge splintering , slamming weight would thump to earth above or below them . The wind sang through a range of demon voices , now harsh as a wildcat 's yowl , now lowing , now shrill as a man whistling through his teeth , sometimes all those at once . Toward dawn a fierce hissing joined in and the women lowered their faces to their knees to protect them from the needlestingsof sleet.  |p233It  was maddening . It seemed to Mary that this pitiless cold lashing had gone on for a year . She clenched her jaws to keep from screaming because to scream would be to become a part of the wild-devil 's soul of the storm itself and she knew there would be no coming back from that . Mary had some confidence that she could anchor her own soul against the storm until daybreak , but she feared for Ghetel 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back for the horse , Mary had suspected was unstable and at times on the very brink . A woman in her state c 'd easy go stark mad this night , Mary thought . And so from time to time she would reach over and find Ghetel 's hand and squeeze it reassuringly , hoping to keep her in touch with her reason . They crawled from cold water into colder air , out of still another creek . They lodged themselves in a crevice between two boulders , to keep themselves from slipping back into the cold swift water if they should faint . They were shuddering and gasping , unable to stand up without support . It was the second creek they had waded this day . It had been breast-deep . The first one had only come to their hips . They stayed there pressed between the boulders and tried to recover their breath , but after five minutes , Mary felt she would die of chill or shake her brittle-cold body to pieces with shivering if she did not start moving . " Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . " " No . No farder . " " Come now . " The old woman glowered and shook her head , her slack lower lip wobbling to and fro as she did . It was chapped and split and bleeding . In these last two days , Mary had seen Ghetel eat the flaking skin off her lips and chew it as if it were food . They had not found anything truly edible since they . had left the place of the burning spring . They had been chewing buds and slippery elm bark and the hairy , hard , sour berry clusters they had found on a small stand of red sumac . None of this seemed to be giving them any strength that they could feel . It filled and stretched their shrunken stomachs , butp234the exhausted fibers of their flesh still clamored for nutrients with a hunger of their own . Ghetel embraced the cold boulder and put the side of her face against it and closed her eyes . " Y ' must come , Ghetel . " A powerful spasm of shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I do not have to do vat you say . " " Oh , but y ' do . " " No . I die from doink vat you say . " " You 'll die here . " " Because I listent to you ! " " Come . " She stretched out a gray , cold hand and grasped Ghetel 's wrist . The old woman jerked free and struck at the hand . Feeble though the blow was , it hurt Mary 's bones . No ! ' " Ghetel . . . " " No ! Damn , damn ! Do n't touch again or I kill you ! " " Ghetel ! " Mary was stunned . She reached to her face to pull back a rope of wet hair that hung over her eye , as if to see this rebellious outburst better . " I kill you , " Ghetel muttered . This new thought seemed to have fixed itself in her desperate brain . " Kill you . " Mary tried to smile , feeling that the old wretch was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But her smile crumbled when she saw Ghetel cast a sidelong glance at the tomahawk , which still hung in a loop of Mary 's belt . She rememberedsuddenly that premonition she had had days ago about giving Ghetel the tomahawk to crack hickory nuts . She inched back , bracingherself against the boulder , to get out of Ghetel 's reach . She lowered the point of her hickory spear between them defensively . Ghetel turned painfully and leaned now with her right shoulder against the rock , and in turn held her spear-point directed at Mary . They stood like this for minutes . Mary 's heartbeat was skipping and fluttering . The old woman 's eyes were terrible , watering with the cold but burning with naked hate . Her filthy white hair , matted and snarled with leaf crumbs and moss and pieces of scab , was plastered wetly against the right side of her face . Mary began shaking her head in disbelief and backing around thep235rock to get out of this creek gorge , to get away from that treacherous stare . She had kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of captivity . She could not comprehend how Ghetel could now turn on her . Unless she had truly lost her reason . Sometimes on this trek  --  during the storm at the burning spring , especially  --  Mary herself had barely managed to cling to her own reason . But never even then had she harbored any notion to hurt Ghetel . Dear God , she thought , what have we got but each other ? She hauled herself painfully up a slope among leafless shrubs , looking back constantly for fear that Ghetel would come at her from behind with her spear . When she reached the high ground where the hill sloped off toward the river , she stood looking back with her spear in her hand , looking back at the boulders at the edge of the creek , watching to see Ghetel come out , come out smiling and contrite , she hoped , ready to go on . Oh , I ca n't bear it , she thought . To have come this far together and then to lose her . She ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to go , without me . Maybe she 'll get herself together and come along and we 'll be all right as we were before . . . Ghetel , gray as a ghost , came slowly out . from behind the boulder , stopped there holding her spear and peering around like a hunter until she saw Mary standing above her . Mary felt a surge of compassion . " Good , " she called down . " Come along now , dear . I knew y'could . . . " The old woman began laboring up the slope toward her , her mouth working as if she were counting her steps or telling her feet to go . The old bell clunked and clanked . When at last she had approached within four yards , she stopped and stood gasping . But now again she lowered her lance tip threateningly toward Mary . She 's still half daft , Mary thought . Lord , give me the wit to talk ' er back to ' er senses . " Ghetel ! Imagine this ! I recognize this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-twenty mile from home ! Oh , I reckon that sounds a lot , but we 've come five or six hundred already , and we 're quite all right , are n't we now ? Another hundred will be easy for such as us , now , wo n't it ?  |p236But  at the same time she was asking herself : A hundred miles ? Can I really even go a hundred more yards ? Nothing changed in the old woman 's face . She shuffled forward a step , still holding the sharpened stake and glaring like a soldier on attack . Mary moved on a few steps along the river bank , sidesteppingmore than walking so that she might keep a wary eye on Ghetel . In the meantime , she cajoled : " Good ! Why , y 're a-comin ' right along . Did n't think y ' could , now did ' ee ? Oh , that 's a fine lady , that is . I knew y ' were n't th ' kind as ' d give up . Nay , Ghetel . Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can count on . .. " The old woman was getting alarmingly close . Mary feigned a burst of gaiety and fairly danced away , as quickly as her aching , exhausted limbs would allow , putting another fifteen feet of safe distance between them . " Come along , dear ! Oh , I feel just so fine about ' em last two cricks , how we just crossed ' em right where we come to ' em , eh ? And did n't have to do a walk-arourid ? Oh , I feel it , this is a fine day for gettin ' along ! Just a fine day ! Why , another week o ' days like this'n an ' surely we 'll be almost home , home to a big of table covered with hot bread , an ' quail pot pies , an ' a great pitcher o ' milk  --  an ' Ghetel , I promise ' ee , I sh 'll make ' ee one o ' my huckleberrycobblers , that are a legend in Virginny . . . " Thus chattering away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that had almost gone barren during their weeks in the wilderness , Mary coaxed Ghetel along for another two miles through a cold sifting rain that afternoon , around the bases of steep hills , over ledges and screes and knots of roots , and through tangles of driftwood , coaxed her along , staying a safe distanceahead of her , fearing her and pitying her and never knowing what was going on in the brain behind that hideously wrinkled and mottled face , that strange , menacing silence . Until , with about an hour 's daylight left , they came to another torrential , steep-sided creek , this one far too wide and fast to wade at its mouth . Mary stopped and looked at it , aghast . She looked up the awful chasm through which it poured , and there was no shallows within sight before it curved away into the mountains . Her little strength , which she had talked into a high state by cajoling Ghetel , suddenly drained out of her with a rush , and she nearly fell down . WI " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bell and felt a hand clutch her blanket . The crazy old woman had closed the gap between them while Mary stood stunned by this obstacle.  |p238MARY  tried to snatch her blanket out of Ghetel 's grasp and hurry out of her reach . But she had too little strength . Her sudden movement simply threw her off balance and she fell with bruising impact on the rocky slope . Ghetel , hardly any stronger , was pulled down with her and fell on her with a grunt and a clattering of the bell . Mary tried to wriggle out from under her and push her back . They grunted and breathed harshly , and stirred leaves and dislodged rocks . Ghetel clutched Mary 's blanket and pulled , as if trying to climb on her and crush her . She had dropped her spear and was clawing at the blanket with both hands . Mary tried to squirm out from under the stinking , desperate , persistent embrace . Their weight on the rocks under her was grinding her flesh against her bones . Mary 's heart was pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her exhausted muscles . Mary at last got a leg free and pressed her knee into the old woman 's throat . The old woman squeezed out a gurgling groan and twisted her head aside , and her yellow teeth clamped down on the naked flesh of Mary 's thigh . She seesawed her jaws as if to bite out a mouthful of the flesh . One of her big front teeth worked loose and fell out . Mary made a fist and struck several times at Ghetel 's temple . With her aching cold fingers and swollen joints , every blow was as painful as striking a rock . But one last blow did cause Ghetel to open her mouth to yowl in pain . Blood was oozing from her toothmarks in Mary 's thigh . Now Mary 's blanket was almost pulled off of her , and she was  |p239naked  on the cold ground except for her belt and the few remaining tatters of her dress . She felt the icy steel blade of the tomahawk turning against the flesh of her waist and realized that Ghetel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its loop in her belt . She grew truly desperate now , overcoming even her physical lethargy and reaching down to grasp the steel head of the weapon and to try to pull it away from Ghetel . For several seconds they strained against each other and wheezed and grunted . Then the loop of yarn broke and the painful bite of the steel edges on Mary 's fingers was too much to bear , and the old woman had the tomahawk . On gaining possession of it , Ghetel began to rise , as if to be in a better position to strike with it . Freed of her opponent 's weight , Mary quickly scrambled aside and got onto all fours . Her right hand found the worn shaft of one of the spears and she picked it up as she rose to her feet . The old woman now was standing , a few feet away and up the slope above Mary , raising the tomahawk to strike . Mary swung the end of the lance in a swift arc at the moment when Ghetel brought the tomahawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hickory and the tomahawk flew out of her hand . She roared in pain as the weapon sailed through the air , swishing through bare twigs , struck a stone ledge several yards down the slope , clattered down a scree of loose shale , ricocheted off a mossy rock at the river 's edge and splashed into the deep , fast , dark water of the tributary . Ghetel 's yelp of pain echoed away into the rush of water and space as the two women watched this precious tool of their survival vanish forever . Even Ghetel , a moment ago seemingly so crazy and bent on destruction , now appeared to comprehend the awfulness of this loss . She stood , gaping down at the place where it had disappeared , slowly and unconsciously folding her barked fingers into the comfort of her other hand , something like fear or shame dawning in her face , transforming her face from a Fury 's mask to that of a guilty child . It was as if the rage leaving her were filling Mary , like some scalding liquid being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on her , eyes blazing , her scrawny naked limbs shaking with outrage , trembling lips shaping words of damnation . " Oh . Oh , ye . . great . . . dull . . . sow ! Oh , thou demon ofp240stupidness ! D' you know what y 've done to us now ? Eh ? Do you ? Oh , you hateful blunderer ! I 'd ha ' better left ' ee with y'r terrible big appetites back there wi ' th ' savages t ' be their squaw ! Aye , that 's th ' full measure of ' ee , damn y'r greedy , whining soul to th ' Infernal blazes ! " Her voice rose to a shriek as she poured this out , and she began advancing on Ghetel holding her spear like a long club . And Ghetel began backing away , blinking , raising her hands to protect herself . " Aye ! Now y 've got your wits back , have n't ' ee , now th ' damage is done ? Oh , tha ' reechy . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she laid on with the long stick , pounding the old bony flanks and shoulders as if beating dust out of a carpet , the stick whistling and whacking , the old woman howling and shrilling , the bell clanking . Now there was none of the brave dignity that had carried Ghetel through the gauntlet . She stumbled backward a few steps and then fell on her rump and sat with her hands laced over her head , begging for mercy . By then Mary had expended all the strength of her outburst , and she dropped the end of the stick to the ground and stood leaning on it , hauling in deep , rasping breaths , exhalations steaming in the chilly air , her ribs rising and falling under her gray , bruised skin , the nipples of her little hard-dried breasts puckered in the cold . And all was still again in a moment , except for Mary 's strenuous breathing and Ghetel 's low , whimpering lamentations in Dutch . Mary was chilling quickly after the heat of her outburst . The cold , raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She eased herself down the slope and picked her ragged blanket up from the ground and wrapped it around herself like a hooded cloak . She took up her spear , and then also the one Ghetel had dropped , set her jaw and turned up the course of the tributary to seek a place to cross it . She did not look back to see whether Ghetel was following or not . She was still too angry , and too full of trepidation about being in the wilderness without a cutting tool , to concern herself with Ghetel . She 's been as much bother as a stubborn mule anyhow , Mary thought indignantly . Glad t ' be shed of ' er , truly . And she 's so miserable , I reckon she 'd be better off dead . She thinks so too , or acts like it . Well , by heaven , ' t is a relief , withal , and I sh 'll enjoyp241light goin ' the rest o ' the way home . Reckon it 's easier to find edibles f'r one than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced along the steep and rock-strewn slope , placing her numb and bleeding feet carefully , hauling herself over ledges and root snarls , dragging the spears with one hand while with the other she fought to keep snagging branches from stripping her of her precious blanket . But she had not progressed a quarter of a mile before she was aware of a terrible aching knot in her throat , so thick and aching that it forced out little strangling noises and made her mutter the name of God over and over , and squeezed out unexpected curtains of tears that she had to wipe away so she could see to continue . It was growing dark now , the dull grays and greens of moss and sycamore dimming to dark gray , and the other tree trunks and the water almost black , and the day cold slid down to evening cold . She heard a rustle of leaves a few yards ahead and looked up to glimpse a wolf trotting ahead of her with its tail low to the ground , pausing now and then to turn its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , propping herself against a fallen tree trunk as thick as she was tall , where she caught her breath and tried to keep from calling Ghetel 's name back down the valley . She busied herself for a few minutes by untying the yarn rope from her waist . She swept off the blanket and stood for a moment shaking it out and rearranging it , finally drapingit around herself in a fashion that allowed her to rope it at the waist , pull two corners of it forward over her shoulders and tie them down in front , thus in effect making a wool dress that left her hands free for the business of carrying the spears and grasping handholds . It was not as warm as before , as her hands and head were bare , but it would be better for moving through tangled brush . And while she was thus dressing herself , she kept glancing back down the chasm . Tears stung her eyelids and her bosom ached , and the lack of her companion spread like a stain over the whole wild landscape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed Ghetel  --  probably as much as Ghetel needed her . But Ghetel did not appear , and when Mary had stalled for ten minutes at the fallen log she told herself that she must get along and try to find a fording place before dark , and that she must not retracep242her steps to go back and fetch Ghetel or she would not manage to get herself home . The old thing 's naught but trouble , she reminded herself . She 's like an anchor and she 's gone daft and wants to kill you , as you 've just seen . You 'd be the worst kind of a fool to go back and get her . If you plan ever to get the last hundred mile up this canyon , y 've got to forget about her just as you forgot about the baby , and put her behind forever . That thought , which she had forbidden herself for so many weeks , sank in on her loneliness and remorse so heavily that she leaned back against the fallen tree trunk and squeezed her eyes shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the anguish had passed . She faced up the gorge and , holding a spear in each hand as walking-sticks , her bone joints grinding in their sockets , the rock bruises of her fight with Ghetel making her wince with every step , she limped forward . Sometimes under the rustle of her footsteps and the rasp of her breathing she would imagine that she heard a voice , and would stop and listen , and would strain to listen through the pulse-poundings in her head and the rush of wind and water , but was never certain she heard a voice , though one seemed to be there , just under the hiss of space and the whiffling of wind , a hair-thin suggestion of a human voice . It made her spine tingle and her heart ache . It was the most utterly lonesome sound she had ever heard , even though she was not sure she was hearing it . Objects  --  tree trunks , rocks , hanging vines  --  were losing their outlines , receding into the deep gray of dusk . Mary eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table to study a place that might provide a crossing . The river fell rapidly here , riffling and spilling over and around slabs and shelves of rock . From here as far as she could see up the stream there were ghostly lines across the watercourse , showing where the water spilled white and foaming over ledges , as if pouring down a flight of rugged stairs . Aye , here I could cross , she thought . Come daylight . Must find a place to lie down and wait out the night , sleep if I can . It 'll take strength I do n't have left now to cross here . Something moved in the corner of her eye , something on thep243shore a little way upstream , on her side of the stream . She tried to look directly at it , but saw nothing at first in the half-light . She turned back to the stream , then detected movement again . This time she saw it . A wolf was standing among the boulders looking at her , perhaps forty feet away . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's edge . They stood together for a moment , then began slinking cautiously toward where she stood . They moved with an eerie silence , or seemed to , as nothing could be heard over the burbling and shushing of the stream . Sometimes they would stop and then she would lose sight of them . Their dull markings blended them into the leafless undergrowth and leaves and rockfill of the mountainside and they were invisible now , except when they moved . A few feet at a time , they were approaching her , coming close down along the water 's edge , weaving among the rocks , close enough to be visible now against the darker wet mass of rock , now stopping to sniff the air , raising and lowering their heads to peer at her , in much the same manner as shortsighted old men will squint and move their heads to make out someone who has entered their room . Mary held " her lances pointed toward the wolves . Her heart was whamming but seemed to be pumping ice-cold blood . She sidled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the cold , wet , sharp-edged rock with her bare feet . What do wolves do ? she thought . She had heard them howl many nights among the mountains , but far away ; none , as far as she knew , had come this close . Unless maybe when we were sleeping , she thought . What do they do ? Jump on you ? Or do they wait till you lie down ? Likely they have their ways o ' knowin ' whether you 're weak , she thought . Once she had heard Henry Lenard tell Will that a wolf can sense dying . They 're not too cowardly to attack , he had said , but they 're smart enough not to risk throwing themselves at something that might be stronger than themselves . Like Indians , Will had observed . Aye , Henry had nodded , like Indians . Mary remembered this old conversation , and she made a decision then that she would have to cross the rapids now , as she dared not lie down on this side of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she still heard the keening of that voice but now she suspected that what she had been hearing , or imagining she had heard , were the warnings of her own fears . Her blanket was reasonably dry and she wanted to keep it that way so she could get warm when she reached the other side of the stream . She laid the spears down within reach , pointed toward the wolves and , keeping an eye on them , began fumbling with numb fingers to untie the knots with which she had fashioned her blanketdress . She took off the blanket and rolled it into a bundle and tied the bundle with the rope of yarn . All that remained of her dress was a few rags of cloth hanging from her shoulders . The dank cold searched over all her body , and she shuddered , knowing that the swift water would be even colder . The wolves , though she had not really seen them moving , were a mere ten or twelve feet away , still watching her . One opened its mouth and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it licked its muzzle and peered at her . Mary put the blanket bundle on her shoulder and slipped the yarn-rope over her head so she could carry the bundle high on her shoulder while keeping both hands free . She gave the wolves one last long look , then with a sudden sense of exhilaration , told them , " Bye now , lads , I got t ' be a-leavin ' . " At the sound of her voice , one cocked its head quizzically and the other side-stepped a few feet in retreat . Then Mary picked up her hickory sticks and turned her back on the wolves and put one leg down into the strong and icy current . The shock of the cold went up her leg , making her hip-joint ache and sending a cascade of shudders from her scalp down to her knees . She lowered her other foot into the water and leaned against the current . She felt ahead for footing with her toes and thus went out an inch at a time into the roaring water . Again she thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure she heard a voice . She was concentrating with all her attention on footing and balance , staring down into the blackness of the stream as if she could penetrate it and see where footholds and dropoffs were , and afraid to look up from this concentration , but now she could hear a voice and it was calling her name . She braced the lances against the bottom and leaned on them and slowly turned her head to look around for the source of the sound.  |p245Ten  yards downstream there was Ghetel , creeping along the bank , hanging onto rocks with one hand . Her drained face and white hair were like a faint , pale lantern against the deep twilight grays of the gorge . Here she came now , that stubborn , cranky , half-mad , hostile old crone who had complicated the flight , and Mary had never in her life been so glad to see anyone . " Here ! " she hallowed back . And then she remembered the wolves . They had seen and heard the old woman 's approach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their backs at her . They were not scared , and were not going to run away , but were backing off to appraise this newly arrived creature , perhaps to determine whether she had death on her . And as Ghetel saw Mary , and began moving more purposefully toward her , crying something incomprehensible over the noise of the rapids , the wolves stopped and turned and began moving toward her , somehow emboldened . " Ghetel ! Look ' ee up ! " Mary raised one of the sticks and pointed it toward the predators . " Wolves ! " The old woman paid no attention . She was busy crying her greetingsor pleadings or apologies or whatever they were , and climbing over and tottering around the boulder heaps and slabs of rock toward the fording place . " Wolves ! " Mary cried again . The old woman was almost opposite Mary now , still jabbering her words , her bell just audible , and the shadowy wolves had come down within ten feet of her , their gray legs tensed and bent as if coiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river was a maddening barrier of sound , baffling their efforts to make their urgent words understood . Mary pointed repeatedlyand violently toward the stalking beasts , but Ghetel , perhaps thinking she was shaking the stick threateningly at her , kept coming toward Mary , talking , and then in a moment she was at the water 's edge , pleading and gesturing , a mere arm 's length from the larger of the two wolves , which crouched on a rock ledge at the level of Ghetel 's shoulders and seemed to be aiming his muzzle directly at her throat . " Ghetel ! " Mary screamed hoarsely , and then in desperation , forgetting how precarious was her balance in the current , she shiftedp246her grip on the spear in her right hand , cocked it over her shoulder and threw it at the wolf . The moment exploded into confusion and movement . Mary lost her balance and fell forward into the fast water . The wolf , struck in the shoulder by the pointed stick , gave a fierce , snarling yap of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Ghetel , startled by the explosion of savage sound and motion , lunged forwardoff the bank and plunged into the icy water . The wolves scrambled and bounded away in the rocks , yelping with fright and rage . Mary and Ghetel were on hands and knees in the swift , shallow water now , trying to get handholds and kneeholds on the rocks of the bottom and keep their faces above water . The current tugged at Mary 's blanket bundle , pulling the strap of yarn tightly across her throat . The icy water swirled and pressed around them , threatening to lift and carry the women away into the deep pool below the ford . Ghetel , now totally occupied with hanging on for her life , had released her hold on her blanket , and the water carried it off of her and away . Mary at last got a foot under herself and teetered to a standing position . She shouted Ghetel 's name and extended to her one end of the lance she still held in her left hand . The old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind to grab for it . With the last of her waning strength , hardly able to draw breath because of the stunning coldness of the water , Mary pulled on the staff until Ghetel could get her feet under her . And now , all but naked , gasping , quaking and moaning , the two women stumbled and floundered in near-darkness through the roaring rapids , each holding one end of the hickory spear , one or the other usually falling and trying to rise , until Mary 's outstretched right hand encountered something solid and rough above the waterline in front of her : a root . She clung to it , crying , " Ghetel , we 're over ! Hold tight ! " She pulled herself toward the bank with the dwindling strength of her right arm and with the other pulled on the staff to drag Ghetel the last few feet . The root was part of the exposed , gnarled root of a big sycamore that had been almost undermined by the flow of the stream . It provided a profusion of handholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were so spent and stiff with cold that their climb out of the creek occupied some five minutes , during which they were in danger of falling back in . It was almost totally dark now . Mary staggered onto the steep bank , trying to support herself with the staff , but fell among stones and driftwood debris , and lay there sucking for breath and enduring waves of shuddering that swept from one end of her aching frame to the other . Ghetel was somewhere nearby in the deep dusk , gasping and voicing long , pitiful , quavering moans . Mary felt that the cold had gone into the marrow of her bones and through her innards , and that the remaining warmth of her heart itself was about to wink out like a candle . To bend a finger hurt , and so it took her a long time to remove the blanket bundle that was slung around her neck and untie the knots that had held it together . As she worked on it , teeth chattering , nose running , fingers stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blanket sliding away into the stream . What an incalculable loss that seemed now . Two women , one blanket . Surely it could be the difference between surviving or not surviving . And something else had been lost this awful day , she seemed to remember ; yes : as if it had happened twenty years ago and just now returned as a memory from childhood , she saw the tomahawk skitteringdown the slope and disappearing into the river . . . Ye God but this day has cost us dear , she thought . And there had been still something else . Her mind was almost too numb to remember , but then she did recollect : the spear she had thrown at the wolves . Aye ! That was gone too ! In the benumbing traversal of the stream even the frightful encounter with the wolves had slipped out of her mind . There . A knot loosened and she drew the end out and groped for the other knot . A tomahawk and a spear and a blanket , she thought . Almost everything of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could make another spear , she thought . Oh , no , we ca n't ! Without the tomahawk we can make nothing . God help us . And we 'd ha ' lost none of it but for the folly o ' that great antic bitch of a Dutchwife lyin ' over there . . .  |p248The  indignation made her heart glow a bit stronger . She thought , defiance flaming up in her breast and warming her blood : Well , by Heaven , old Ghetel , we shall see just how long I 'll put up with a troublesome piece o ' baggage th ' like of you . . . But then she remembered the unbearable aching emptiness , the loneliness , when Ghetel had been out of sight behind her . " Come , dear , " she said , rising with agony to her feet and letting the partially wet blanket fall open and advancing toward the sounds of Ghetel 's misery , " let 's us bundle now in this blessed blanket , or . . . or we 're goners for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had blundered weakly about in the darkness , every stinging cold raindrop and every touch of their sodden rags provoking a bone-rattling shudder , seeking some overhang or hollow log under which to roll up , finally getting under a huge log that had fallen across a fissured outcropping ; they had raked enough fallen leaves into the fissure to insulate their cocoon against the clammy earth under them and the dank air above , and had burrowed into the leaf pile and pulled the blanket around themselves and lain skin on skin in an embrace , waiting for their bodies to produce some faint warmth for each other . But each found the other cold as death ; Mary remembered her father icefishingonce , and two fish lying in a snowbank ; their contact now was like that . Their heartbeats were weak flutters and skips . Each felt the other 's tremors as well as her own . They lay breast to breast and belly to . belly , each one 's arms full of the other 's bones . No warmth came , for a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the senses and a dulling of minds , a slowing and thickeningof dreams , as if thought itself were congealing ; and Mary 's last nameable thought was that this nothingness was the relief of death . She waited and listened inside her head for familiar voices and watched behind her eyes for light or familiar faces or other hints of heaven . The rain stopped . For a while water drops dribbled and pattered off the twigs to the leaves of the forest floor and the clouds above the trees dissolved to let starlight through , and after a while there was a sliver of a moon over the mountain , and after it had ridden for two hours into the sky above the gorge , all the leaves on the groundp249looked like silver flakes in their sheen of moonlit new frost . Across the river , from high on a ridge , spun the eerie tremolo of a wolf 's howl . Moonlight flickered like cold flame on the fast black water . In the blanket covered with leaves under a slanting tree trunk , nothing moved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary lay in total darkness remembering dying ; before the blanknesshad come she had been thinking that that was the experience of dying , but now she knew that she had not died , but had only gone unconscious , because now she was alive , had just now been awakened by a dream of wolves and could hear them now outside , far away , howling in the cold . And in a way she was disappointed that she had not died , because death had seemed like a rather fair place after all , certainly better than what she had been enduring for the last four or five weeks and had yet to endure for another week or two . But no , she thought now , I do n't really want to die so far away from Will , I do n't want to die without Will knowing whether I 'm alive or not or where I am . I do n't really want to die at all while Will 's still alive because I 'm his wife and he counts on me . Nay , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to die at all because I 'm young and Will 's young and we have to beget us another family to go on in place of our three tads them bloody savages has cost us ; Will would n't be happy atall if they was no Ingles children t ' reap what he 's sown . He might find another wife if I was to perish here , she thought . Now I do n't like the thought o ' that hardly atall , so let 's just not have any more thoughts of this dyin ' business . . . Mary 's breathing was slow and steady now and her heartbeat was thumping along steadily , not fluttering like a candle in a draft as it had been , and she could hear that Ghetel 's breathing was all right too . Oh , Dear God , but we come near enough t ' have a peek at you this night , I swear we did . Ghetel and me both . She remembered that after the crossing of the cold fast stream they both had been too chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to each other . Ghetel had simply followedp250her and they had hollowed out and padded up this crevice they were in , and Ghetel had crawled in beside her , and maybe Ghetel had thought she was dead , too . Old Ghetel got sane again after that crossing , Mary thought . Guess she was just too miserable t ' think any more about killin ' me . An ' now here we are sleepin ' close as a man and wife do . After her takin ' after me with th ' tomahawk and me thrashin ' her with that hickory pole . Oh , God , do n't it beat all ! Somehow during the night , after they had gone unconscious , instead of their hearts stopping , instead of the cold creeping the rest of the way in and snuffing out their hearts , their hearts had driven the cold back , driven it back out of their torsos and their limbs and finally even out of their feet , and the warmth of their blood had eventually reached to their skin ; then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel 's and Ghetel 's had reached Mary 's , and they had been heating each other the way a hot stone warms your feet when you step off the cold floor and slip into bed . They had warmed each other so well that even the damp blanket felt dry now . The utter numbness had gone out of Mary 's feet and they ached in a dull way now , even , from time to time , felt as if they were being struck with thousands of little needles , which would make her legs twitch , and she was glad she could feel them . It was not truly what one could call warm here in this blanket , but it was not terribly cold , and where the two women 's bare skin touched , there actually was warmth . It 's a miracle what 's happened while we slept , Mary thought . Thank ' ee , 0 Lord in Heaven , for another little miracle . I reckon I 've thought some unworthy thoughts your way from time to time since last July ; still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' way you have , but y ' do seem to come around an ' look after us now and then after your fashion , so I must guess you have n't forgot us altogether . Now I admit Will and me often forgot our prayers , sometimes for days at a time , as they 's so much t ' do when you live out here this side o ' th ' mountains and have to make and do everything , just everything , for yourself , so we often forgot , it 's true , and maybe that 's why ' y ' brung th ' Shawnee savages down on us . As that horseback preacher said last spring , might be y 're a jealous an ' wrathful God , and need reg'lar devotions from us thy mortal children  --  like Willp251hisself needed it a lot from Tommy an ' Georgie  --  but Lord , Lord it do n't seem fair what y 've done to us . Or maybe all this misery is just random , she thought then , and God has nothin ' t ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more charitable way to consider God , but soon she was ashamed of herself for having thought that anything could happen without God 's intervention . I wonder me what Ghetel will be like on th ' morrow , Mary thought . Back to herself , I pray . I figger there 's a hundred mile more to go , provided we do n't lose our way , an ' more if we do , and I surely ca n't go a hundred mile while a-fightin ' a crazy woman every step , now can I ? Mary was drowsy again and her limbs were buzzing with the sleep feeling , but she wanted to run the succession of landmarks up out of her memory one more time , because the difficulties of the last few days had rather befogged them . There were n't many landmarks left . They had come back past most of them . The next one she could recall was the big creek where the Indians had washed the paint off of themselves and had painted the trees . That was the creek where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of a Shawnee baby . Let 's see , she thought . We was ten or twelve days  --  twelve , if I remember correct  --  down from Draper 's Meadows when we come down out o ' that crick , an ' I remember we crossed th ' New River there at a shallows to th ' other bank there . She could remember that , and was sure she would recognize it , but beyond that the prospect became quite bewildering , with hardly a landmark . She could remember that they had ridden for several days north along a high-level ridge without a glimpse of the New River . Lordy , she thought , a shiver of awe running down her flanks , I ca n't guide us up that crick and up that ridge because I was half out o ' my head when we come down it and it 's all either blank or dreamy . I could n't find our way back the way we come those few days ; I got to keep us right along the New River . I das' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered , as she had wondered before , why the Indians had left the New River and gone up that mountain ridge . The only reason they take a way , she thought , is ' cause it 's most passable.  |p252That  'd likely mean we came down over the mountain way because the New River for some stretch in there was too rough f'r good travel . Her heart sank and she felt even more hollow than she had been feeling all these hungry , tiring weeks . God knows what we 're a-gonna find the valley like after we get above that painted-tree creek , she thought . God help us . Lord , she thought , I hope y 've had your fill o ' punishin ' me , for I 've a feelin ' I 'll need all y'r kind aid and guidance to get through this next week or two . And then Ghetel groaned and shifted in her sleep , one of her legs drawing away from one of Mary 's , leaving it cold where it had been almost warm , and Mary lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her own , hugging her still with one arm , this old woman who had tried to kill her , and it was strange , the strangest thing ever , because after trying to kill and beat each other they had needed each other so much that Mary had lingered waiting for Ghetel to come along and Ghetel had come along the ravine crying for Mary . They had needed each other because it was more than one could bear to be out here in this land alone . But Mary knew , even as she held the sleeping hag for the warmth of life , that she would have to be on guard every minute Ghetel was awake , and that she must never sleep while Ghetel was awake . I 'd better just stay awake now till morning so 's she wo n't wake up afore me , Mary thought . And that was what she was thinking when the wooliness moved into her head and she went to sleep.  |p253IN  PHILADELPHIA when she was a little girl , Mary had taken pity on a pariah dog she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been something wordlessly good in its dark brown eyes when it had looked up at her , and she had gone into the house and taken a blood pudding from the pantry , stolen it out past her parents and given it to the pariah dog . Then she had gone back in the house thinking about the dog , and that night the dog had scratched at the door . Mary awoke now to a sound of scratching , dreaming about the dog . She started awake . It was early dawn . Ghetel was sitting up , half out of the blanket , her legs still covered , doing something that made that scratching sound , and Mary was instantly defensive , angry at herself for not staying awake . Stealthily , she extricated her arm from the blanket and reached behind her to grasp the handle of the pointed pole which she had placed in her side of the hollow the night before . Ghetel was clawing at the rotten bark on the underside of the big fallen tree that sheltered them . Bark debris and woodpunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the half-light , would scrabble in the decaying wood for a moment , then pause and put something to her mouth . Th ' poor thing 's eatin ' punk , Mary thought . She 's a-goin ' to kill herself yet to fill ' er guts . Mary herself was nothing but a tremendous craving hollowness ; the blood pudding of her dream wasp254still tantalizing the back of her mind , even though she had never liked blood pudding . " Enough o ' that , dear , " Mary said wearily , and at the sound of her voice Ghetel jerked around like a child caught stealing . But then she said , in a voice that sounded actually cheerful : " Nah , May-ry . All 's well . " " Please don ' eat wood . Y ' make me ill . " Hauling against an enormous weariness , Mary crept out of the blanket and stood up outside the shelter in a frost-covered world , squatted on painwrackedlegs to make steamy water , shivering and surveying the weather and trying to get her bearings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast stream they had crossed last evening rushed and gurgled nearby . The sky above the ravine was pinkish-blue and the leafless trees on a ridge far downstream caught the early-morning sunlight and gleamed a soft rosy yellow . Promise of a fair day but cold . It would be hours before the sun could mount high enough to light these deep valleys . And us with one blanket a-tween us now , Mary thought . One and t ' other of us 'll have to go naked in turn . Nay , she thought then , angrily : She lost her blanket . She 'll go naked . Forgive me , she thought then . Of course we 'll take our turns . If the old thing 'll cooperate we will . I think she be a-needin ' a lecture . She heard footsteps above ; over the noise of the stream she heard leaves crushing . She stood and turned , hoisting the spear . A deer came down between two mossy ledges of rock , going toward the creek . It was a buck with fine antlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then went on down to the stream . It was too far away for her to throw the spear at it . She took a few cautious , wobbly steps toward it , her skin in gooseflesh , frost biting her bare feet , her breath condensing . The buck raised its head from drinking and bounded away up the bank . The white under its tail disappeared in the brush . Ah well , Mary thought . Nothing lost . No expectations for that'n . She went back and peered under the log . Ghetel was sitting in the dim cranny , the blanket up over her shoulders , a mass of wood-rotp255in her upturned palm . She was probing in it and putting things in her mouth . She was too intent to see Mary loom over her . Mary bent down and looked closely , then shuddered violently . Ghetel was picking little dark beetles out of wood dust and eating them . Ghetel became aware of Mary , raised her eyes and suddenly hid her hands in the blanket . She looked angry . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary 's mouth gaped . She saw a blaze of red behind her eyes . She reached in and grabbed the edge of the blanket and jerked it with all her might , dragging it off Ghetel and dumping her over . " You find a blanket , " she snapped . She flung the blanket around her shoulders , took one hard last glance at the awful-looking bundle of baggy gray skin and protruding bones floundering to sit up under the log , then stalked away down the creek bank . About thirty yards farther on she stopped , stood looking at the cliffs , took a deep breath and sighed it out , and waited until she heard Ghetel 's neck-bell and querulous mutterings coming along behind her . She turned and watched her catch up , meandering as if drunk , kicking up leaves as she stumbled forward , her baggy skin flapping as loose as the rags of her dress , holding something forward in her palm . " Forgif ? " she said plaintively , drawing near . " Here . I bring you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ghetel , hear me , I must tell you how it 's to be if we go on together . . . Listen ! " Ghetel stood there twitching and trembling with the cold , eating the rest of the beetles , then dusted the wood punk off her palms , and waited , ruminating on her revoltingcud , staring ingenuously at Mary with her bleared hazel eyes , waiting for admonitions she perhaps understood were deserved . Older'n my mother , Mary thought , yet I must now scold ' er down like a nose-pickin ' child . " Ghetel , I come away ' cause I got a pinin ' for a faraway place and my husband who needs me . That , dear , is why I 'm not t ' be stopped , by starvin ' , nor sickness , nor any kind o ' hurt . Nor'lI I be stopped by a woman who grudges me my purpose . " I know your purpose is weaker , as you 're goin ' t ' no one . And Lord knows y'r gut rules ye more'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd eat bugs !  | " Many ways , I know , y 're stronger'n me . Oh , aye ! How you took that whuppin ' at the Shawnee town ! Now , I 'd 've died I 'm sure ! I admired that more'n you could know . " But now , dear , having purpose , I 'm the stronger one . And though I need ' ee quite some , why , I sh 'll just go on alone if ' ee ever serve me as bad as ' ee did yesterday ! Aye , leave ' ee back , and a good riddance , too ! Now , are we agreed , eh ? " The old woman had swallowed her bugs . She nodded and stood hugging her bosom and shaking . " Aye , aye . Vat I done yesterday I do n't remember . But I do n't hurt you again , May-ry . Oh , I am cold ! " " We must get a-movin ' or we 'll seize up frozen . Now , listen , Ghetel , I sh 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , but only if ' ee promise to give me it back when I say . A promise ? " " Yah , a promise . " " I mean your true word , God as your witness . " " Yah . Gott I swear . " " So be it . Now come . " They reached the mouth of the roaring creek and turned southeastwardlate in the morning . The descent had taken them hours because they had had to cross two great , precarious rockslides where any misstep sent stones and boulders tilting out from under their feet and rattling and crashing down into the creek . They had also been slowed by Ghetel 's new taste for bugs . She had picked up a sharp-edged piece of flat rock , and at virtually every downed tree she had lagged behind to hew rotten bark away with the stone and look for such beetles as she had enjoyed for breakfast . Mary , grew impatient , and was constantly coaxing her on . But in a way it was better ; as long as Ghetel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed less desperate , less sullen toward Mary , less dangerous . Ghetel had found no more bugs despite all her stalling and hacking , but she seemed certain that she would , and was comparativelyhappy . Crossing the rockslides had done awful damage to their feet . The skin was off most of their toes and ankles and they left little red smudges of blood wherever they stepped . Mary had a deep gash in the arch of her right foot and a puncture in the sole of her left wherep257a locust-thorn had gone in at least an inch . She had pulled it out but a part of the point had broken off and was deep in the flesh . Ghetel had caught her left foot between two jagged rocks , and in trying to lift one off had badly ground up the flesh of her little toe . But , as the white bone was visible , they had been able to inspect it and see that the toe was not broken . Every part of their feet had been stubbed and jammed and scraped countless times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise that the new pain could be felt through the old pain . And so when they reached the narrow strip of bottomlandin the New River gorge , they sat down on a drift log in the weak November sunlight and , despite the chill of it , made plasters of the icy mud and caked each other 's feet in them . They spent an hour there , sitting side by side on the log , the blanket across both their backs , facing the sun , all the weight off their feet , letting the mud dry and pull the sharp pains out of their feet . " Notice ? " Mary said . " Y'can count your heartbeat by th ' throbbin 's in your feet . " They did that for a while as the sun shone on their faces and closed eyelids . Ghetel jerked awake suddenly , saving herself from falling backward off the log . They sat in the hush of the river valley and waited for the courage to put their weight back on their feet and go . A flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush ten feet away : a cardinal . He sat on a swaying twig looking about with abrupt little turns of his crested head , his bead-black eyes almost invisible in the band of black around the base of his beak . Mary was seeing him with an intense clarity of vision brought on by her utter emptiness , a kind of seeing in which he was not just a bright red bird in a wintry landscape of browns and grays and dying greens , but was a flying vehicle designed to carry the vibrancy of its life from place to barren place and thus to keep all places from being without the beauty of life . Mary had never had such a thought before , and she was staring at the bird the way she had stared at the burning spring several nights before , warming her soul at it , when Ghetel moved abruptly beside her and flung the rock she had been carrying . The toss was feeble and inaccurate ; the rock struck low in the bush , shaking it , and the cardinal fluttered away untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? " she demanded.  |p258Ghetel  's eyes were blazing , happily . " I just t'ink : There are alvays birds , here , dere . . . and a bird is not much to eat , but it is more den a bug ! We carry rocks , eh ? And one time now and den , ven ve trow ve don ' miss , eh ? And ve vill eat a bird dat day , eh ? " Mary shook her head . Ghetel and her gut . But when they put their weight on their feet , groaning with the returning pain and then getting used to it , and started to move on , Mary stooped alongside Ghetel and gathered rocks of good throwing size , enough of them to carry at the ready in one hand . It was true , there were always many birds darting about , even in this stark season , and one bird , one cardinal or mockingbird , even one small oriole or robin or a tiny sparrow , would be more nourishment than they had taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working things out in the lightheadednessof hunger , maybe that is what the redbird was telling us , all bright red and full of life like that . Early in the afternoon they reached the creek of the painted trees . By that time they had gathered and thrown several handfuls of stones , but had come nowhere near bringing down a bird , and Mary was beginning to understand that if they ever did hit one of the swift little creatures with their feebly-thrown missiles , it would be more by chance than by aim . She had resigned herself to that . Still , there was a chance , and so they carried rocks and they stalked birds and threw at them as they went along . But somehow as they progressed they saw fewer birds , and Mary sensed that somehow the birds were warning each other . The river and the paint-tree creek both were higher and faster than they had been in July . They could not wade across the New River at the shoal ; it would have been too high and fast now even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would have to do still another walk-around to get across the paint-tree creek . So they turned up through the brushy , narrow canyon . The narrow bottomland where they had camped on the way down was under water now , just saplings and bushes sticking up out of the water , and where the sides of the gorge were too steep to walk on the two women waded in the cold water up to their knees and held to a bush , a tree , a root , a vine . They were extremely weak now and didp259not trust their benumbed legs to support them even in this shallow water , so they would not let go of one handhold until they had a new one . This creek twisted like a snake around the base of steep mountainswhose sides seemed to mount to the very center of the sky , and the sun was down from sight early in the afternoon so there was not even that faint warmth to bless their skin . The ravine was so narrow that Mary sometimes had to hang onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountainsides were not moving together to crush her . They went about five miles up the west side of this creek before they found a place of riffles and decided they could cross there . Mary decided . The old woman was simply following along now , moaning with hunger or pain or both , stopping now and then to heave a rock weakly at some bird . They waded across the creek easily , simply clenching their teeth and letting the egg- and fist-sized pebbles of the bottom torture their feet as they would ; that did not matter any more ; they just had to get across this creek and back down to the river before dark . Mary had assumed a similar attitude about her stomach . It was simply going to gnaw and hurt and give her that awful , weakening hollowness , and that was the way it was . She did not try to find just any old thing to put into it anymore ; she simply was not as desperate as Ghetel to have something in it for the sake of having something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing in it at all than to have it half full of such trash as Ghetel was continually picking up and gnawing and swallowing : bark and seed pods and husks , fungus off the dead trees , dead moss full of dirt , and now , even beetles and grubworms . But as dusk came down and they returned to the valley of the river , Mary 's hunger made her so faint that the world around her began humming and swooping , and she realized that even though she could stand the misery of starving , her body would not keep going much longer on nothingness . It really had exhausted all the residue of roots and sumac berries and slippery-elm bark she had eaten days before and was now consuming itself , and will or no , or Will or no , her body would simply stop here . The truth was that she could not ignore her hunger any longer ; she could not just rise aboveit.  |p260And  so in the last light of this day she hunted food alongside Ghetel with an equal urgency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They found a few acorns , cracked them with rocks and ate the dried-up , leathery , bitter meats . They threw rocks in vain at a few sparrows . They threw the spear at a raccoon and missed . And when Ghetel at last barked an old log that yielded a few squirming grubs , Mary did take a few in her palm and , trying to think of faraway things , threw them into her mouth and swallowed them , unable to bear the thought of chewing them . When they were down she gave a great shudder . And she had a grim thought then that made her smile : If you don ' eat worms , they 'll be eatin ' you . She felt a little stronger in the morning . Clouds had come up from the southwest , again dulling the colors of the valley but warmingthe air a bit . There was no frost this morning and the ground was soft and moist , squishy with cold damp . Ghetel was reasonably cheerful , being warmer and not quite so famished as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand , spontaneous hug . We 'll do all right mostly , Mary thought . But when times are at their worst , I must watch ' er . To keep Ghetel complacent , Mary decided to devote a while to feeding before they started up the gorge this morning . They found a quantity of the sour , fuzzy sumac berries in an old burnt-over draw , but could eat only a handful as they were brown and dusty dry and disintegrating . They flaked old shelf funguses off dead trees , gray , leathery and foul-tasting , but filling , and pulled a few water's-edge stalks and ate their bitter bulbs . Still queasy about the eating of worms , though now resigned to it , Mary helped Ghetel hunt for grubs . They found none . But Mary remembered how Henry Lenard had used to turn up rocks to find earthworms for fishbait . And somehow the thought of healthy pink earthworms this morning seemed less revolting than that of the white grubs , which reminded her too strongly of maggots . So , in the humus-rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began turning rocks over , and in fifteen minutes had a palm full of glistening , reddish-pink crawlers . Ghetel , delighted , fell to the same work and soon had a good handful.  |p261All  right now , Mary told herself , do n't think , just do it . Just like a bird . She shut her eyes and put three or four in her mouth and chewed them quickly and swallowed them . They were tough and slimy and cold and strangely sourish , and left her teeth gritty . But there was no doubt : it was meat . It would strengthen her fibers and enrich her blood . She ate the rest , and , under the influence of those thoughts , they tasted more palatable each mouthful . " Eh well , dear , " she said to Ghetel , who was beaming now , " truly that was the best breakfast we 've had in an age , say what ? Y ' ready to walk now ? Here , you wear the blanket a while first . " Ghetel nodded and flung it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her now ; since their fight , she had hardly said a dozen sentences , but would often discourse with herself in Dutch as they struggled along . Within a few hours of walking , Mary began to notice a change in the aspect of the valley above the painted-tree creek . The mountainsideswere steeper and more forbidding , and were footed right on the river 's edge . There was no level bottomland to walk on . The river tumbled furiously , glassy green and white , among boulders as big as houses , which lay at the bases of the cliffs from which they had fallen . The mountainsides soared steeply a thousand feet or more up from the roaring riverbed , darkly forested all the way from the water 's edge to their crests . Huge , water-weathered gray trees , undermined by the river 's force , lay jammed among the boulders , their gnarled roots upended , their branches in the tugging river , sometimes entangling great masses of dead bushes and reeds that had been swept into their clutches by old floods . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fallen into the river , leaving stark blue-gray cliff faces as precipitous as walls , hundreds of feet high , topped with full-size forest trees which , from this distance , looked tiny as blades of grass . Ahead stood a mountainside whose entire slope from the crest to the base was covered by the scar and scree of an avalanche : an enormous slide of boulders and dirt leaning a third of the way up the mountainside , full of splintered trees and jutting root-boles , massiveash and walnut trees bent double or twisted open like segments of frayed rope by the weight and force of the rockfall ; above was thep262bald face of new rock from which it all had come , slanting a thousand feet into the sky . We 'll have to cross all that rubble , Mary thought . Pray it 's done all the fallin ' it 's going to do . Inured though they were by now to the power and indifference of the wilderness , the two women felt the grim force of this gorge pressing on their senses and squeezing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy , craggy , roaring canyon was like being on the floor of the den of a giant , who might step on them at any moment without noticing or caring . Mary felt as tiny as any one of the lice now making their way through the folds of her own flesh . It 's no wonder the Indians take the ridge road around it , she thought . For a moment she considered turning back to the painttreecreek and going that way . Nay , she thought . I 'd get us lost in the mountains for sure . At least I know this awful gorge leads to home . There was nothing so simple as walking now ; it was now mostly a business of climbing , scooting , crawling and sliding over and around the gigantic rubble of the riverbed . To skirt a squarecorneredrock chunk the size of a barn they would have to climb over two or three as large as cabins . Often they would find their way barred by a huge snarl of fallen trees or drifted brush , and would snake through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking thorns and splinters , snagging and losing still more of their skimpy rags , forever afraid that their efforts would dislodge some key log and cause the whole jam to rend itself apart and crush them or drop them into the torrent below . By midafternoon , they were in a trance of exhaustion . Mary lay face down on a huge tilted slab of gray rock . Blue-green splotches of lichen grew dim , then sharp , then dim again , an inch before her eyes , while the river drummed loud and faint and loud in her ears . She might have slept . She was not sure . But after an indefinite time she became aware that she was very cold and it was time to move . Looking up the raging stream , between the V-shaped canyon walls , they could see range after range of such steep-edged mountainssitting with their feet in the river , each mountain a degree higher and hazier than the one in front of it , a progression of fading grays marching into the distance until they were indistinct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from either side of the river , ragged wraiths of mist curled and shifted upward , like a slow dance of ghosts . Now Mary began to suspect that the Indians ' avoidance of this gorge was as much from a fear of evil spirits as of terrain . They crossed the debris of the avalanche late that afternoon . It took them an hour to climb through the boulders and rubble and dead wood . Several times , rocks loosened under their feet and bounced and crashed down into the river ; worse , they heard stones clattering and bumping above them once , and hugged themselves against a jutting log , expecting to be buried in a rockfall . The wind was cold , the stones were cold , the water , when they had to step into it and wade around the bases of bluffs , was very cold . Their skin was clammy and white and usually covered in gooseflesh . They would get hot and winded while climbing , and when they had to stop to rest , the wind would chill them immediately . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wear it while they were wading ; and when they dropped down to rest they would huddle together in it . They finally found a place where a finger of land sloped gently enough that they could walk in the woods , on a cushion of dead leaves . Here they found another hollow log lying on its side and decided this would be their camp for the night . They had to shout to make themselves heard over the roar of the river . Mary wondered how they would be able to sleep in such noise . Sometimes during the day the noise had pressed so hard on her soul that she had thought she would scream and go mad . It was as constant and loud as the windstorm the night they had spent across from the burning spring . Mary thought it was making her heart beat faster . Under this constant drumming of wilderness , the faint metallic sounds of the bell were welcome , like delicate music , a civilized sound . Here in the woods they turned over rocks and found a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary was hungrier than she had been yet . There had been periods downriver when they had not eaten anything for four or five days , but even then she had not been as famished as she was now . So she ate the worms this time with no thought except how good they were.  |p264Ghetel  was behaving rather well . She seemed distant and distracted , but she was not giving Mary those hostile looks , and she had been following well . Really , very well , Mary thought . I may not be havin ' any more trouble with ' er . I mean if I can keep ' er full of worms . Let 's hope there wo n't be a hard freeze where the worms go deep , she thought . It 's nice to be able just to turn over a few rocks and find meat . She was beginning to think of the worms in terms of meat now instead of as worms . That was good . They filled the hollow log with leaves and burrowed in with the blanket . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of the river was muffled a bit and it was not so intimidating . As they lay together skin on skin they grew warmer , and as they grew warmer , their aches and bruises eased a little and they grew sleepy . Mary appreciated Ghetel 's body heat , and she thought a great deal about her and tried to imagine what must be in her mind . She 's truly stalwart , Mary thought . She really is something out of the ordinary . She felt tears sting her eyes as she held the old bones close . Thou'rt close as family , she thought to the old woman . Like family , a great botheration sometimes . But what we two 've been through 'd bind folks closer'n family . She remembered the uneasiness she had had that day so long ago , when she had been afraid to give Ghetel the tomahawk . She had been right about that . The old woman really had wanted to hurt her ; she 'd been out of her noggin . It was n't hard to understand , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been able to read Ghetel 's intentions was because the two of them had become so close through this ordeal . It was almost like what she had heard about twins . There was some bridge between them . We 're close as twins , you and me , because we been dependin ' on each other so long out here in these valleys where there ai n't anything else but you and me , she thought . Aye , old thing . You 're family . And when we get home , I 'll have Will see to't that y'have anything your heart desires , I will . She wondered how far they had come today . Surely not more'n ten or fifteen miles , she thought , though it seemed more like fifty , allp265that climbin ' an ' scootin ' . She smiled at the thought : Been days since I had any skin on my feet . Now my knees and my hindy end 's likewise . Ghetel 's breathing was gurgly . She coughed in her sleep , jerking violently , enveloping Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary patted her gently , rhythmically on the back , as if soothing her baby . Her baby . For a moment she pictured her baby . Or , rather , a little shape . She could not see its face . She had been careful not to know its face . Now she could not have remembered its face if she had tried to . She envisioned a little shape , nursing at the breast of Otter Girl . She was slipping into sleep . She saw Will . She saw herself with Will . He was asking her where the baby was , their baby that he had never seen . There was a blank space in her mind when she fell asleep because she did not know how she would answer that when he asked her . The valley seemed to widen as they went on the next morning . The river was about a quarter of a mile wide , running shallow , its surface roiled . The noise of its flow was less overwhelming here in this wider space . There were broad flat tables of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do.They progressed without great difficultyfor three or four miles . The sun was trying to break through the gray clouds that hid the mountaintops . They could see it as a pale smear in the dark sky , but sometimes the mist in the draws would swirl over it like smoke and blot it out again . Something was drumming on Mary 's ears . She grew aware of it little by little , some deep rumble beyond the rushing of the river . They rounded a bend and it became louder . " Look'ee , Ghetel ! " Mary pointed . A mile ahead there was a line of greenish-white extending from bank to bank . Beyond that was a great dark mountainside topped with clouds . " A waterfall , ai n't it ? " Ghetel peered up the river , her mouth hanging open . Her lower front teeth were yellow and there was gray matter against her gums . Her lower lip was a rim of bleeding sores and scabs . She nodded and looked at Mary with a question in her eyes . Mary knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  |p266As  they went up , the falls became more distinct , louder , more formidable . They were like a giant 's stairsteps , over which the graygreenwater fell roaring five or ten feet at a drop , seething white at the foot of each cascade . The falls extended from shore to shore , broken only by a small wooded island that lay in the great pool below them . The shore here was sand and shingle . Trees stood high out of the sand , their gnarled , grotesque root boles three or four feet above the ground where the soil had washed out from under them . As the women moved along and came opposite the island , they saw that there was a smaller island at the top of the falls , with brush growing on it . The dark water seethed with foam here in the pool . The air was wet with the fall 's mist . Mary kept studying the falls at the right shore , where they would have to pass , to see whether there would be a dry place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; they would be swept away . It looked bad . There was no sloping ground to ascend . The falls roared over their rock shelves right at the base of a perpendicular bluff of striated rock . No , she thought . Oh , no . We just ca n't come up blocked here . Not after all this . Let 's go closer . Must be we can find a way up . The narrow shore of shingle and sand dwindled to nothing as they crept under the bluff . Soon they were standing right in the falls ' spray , on a narrow ledge of wet rock with the foamy water swirling a few inches below their feet . They held onto the sheer rockface and stared , nearly hypnotized , at the glassy curtain of water falling beside them . Mary clung with her fingertips to the cold , wet rock , squinting up the cliff looking for a way up , her heart tripping , her skin and rags growing damp . The hissing , rumbling force of the plunging river was pounding her senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cliff they were clinging to was moving , tilting with them on it . She swallowed rapidly against panic . Her mouth was dry . " Go back ! " she cried . She turned her face toward Ghetel and shouted it again . " GO BACK ! " The old woman 's face was a mask of cringing terror . She clung to the rock , frozen , afraid to move a muscle . There was no room forp267Mary to go around her and lead her back to safety ; the ledge was too narrow . Mary was trapped on the lip of rock , her legs beginning to twitch and quiver uncontrollably , and Ghetel was frozen between her and the route back to the shore . And that awful notion of giving up , of stepping so easily off into the water and putting an end to all this suffering , was beginning to insinuate itself in her head again . What 's it matter ? she thought again . And somehow that thought calmed her . Her legs stopped quaking . She grinned at Ghetel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ghastly as a death 's head ; she could feel her mouth corners drawn back and down against her teeth , and the strain around her eyes . Got to move her , Mary thought . Got to . We 're both going to fall in a minute if we do n't get back . Leaning her precious spear against her left arm , she freed her right hand to reach over and touch Ghetel 's left hand , which was locked , rigid as a root , in a tiny crevice at eye level . She patted the hand gently for a moment , then closed her hand over it and gently tried to pull it loose , to move it over a few inches and make Ghetel understand that they were to go back . But the old hand grew even harder ; the fingers dug in like talons . A terrified , keening wail started coming from Ghetel 's open mouth and she pressed her face against the rock . Her eyes were wild . Dear God , she thinks I 'm trying to throw her in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Or she 'll try to throw me in . She took her hand off Ghetel 's . The old woman stopped wailing . Mary searched her mind for something to say . Then : " Ghetel , hon , " she yelled , " I know an easier way ! I know a wayaround ! " She forced another squinting smile , and looked past Gheteltoward the way they had come , and nodded . The look in Ghetel 's eyes changed a bit . She shut her mouth and looked suspiciously at Mary 's face for a moment , as if not sure she should turn her attention away from her for even an instant . Mary nodded and looked downstream again , nodding emphatically . At last Ghetel began turning her head , but kept her eyes on Mary as long as she could . Finally she was looking the other way.  |p268Now  , Mary thought . She 's lookin ' the way of safety ; maybe now she 'll go . Slowly , she moved her hand toward Ghetel 's again , and lightly patted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scream started , and in the same instant she released the rock to fling Mary 's hand away . The motion nearly dislodged Mary from the face of the cliff , and Ghetel herself tottered for a moment before hooking her talons into the crevice again . An enervating shiver sizzled through Mary 's body and her heart seemed to be twitching in her neck . She clung to the cliff with both hands herself now , face pressed against the rock , the water still roaring ominously beside her . That had been too close . She breathed deeply until she could think . Eh well . No gentle coaxing was going to do it , she realized . Sometimes there 's but one way to get through that thick Dutch head . She locked her own left hand more firmly into its fingerhold . With her right she took the shaft of the hickory stock and swung it out behind her over the water , then yelled : " God damn'ee , Ghetel ! MOVE ! " And she swung the stick to whack across the bony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her balance was too precarious for that . But she struck her again , then again , yelling like a banshee : " MOVE , Y'CLOD ! GET THAT REECHY CARCASS 0 ' YOUR'N OUT OF MY PATH ! MOVE , DAMN ' EE ! " Ghetel looked at her , flinching , and she seemed suddenly more afraid of Mary than of moving ; she began to move . She inched back along the cliff . Mary followed her . In a minute they were back on the beach . They were so weak they sank to the ground . Mary moved close to Ghetel and drew the blanket over them both . They sat there for a long time , trembling , while Ghetel moaned to herself and said things in Dutch . When they had calmed themselves , Mary got up and went a few yards down the shore , pausing now and then to peer up the mountainside . After a while she found a gap in the cliff where they could climb up by holding roots and ledges and get onto the slope above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far above . The climb took two hours , and they became dizzy when they paused and looked down through the bare trees onto the huge jagged waterfall far below them , the relentless gray-green water andp269swirls of white foam . The mountain slope they were on curved to their right , following a bend in the river above the falls . They had gone a mile around the mountain , a hundred feet above the water , when they saw below them a juncture of two rivers , one coming toward them from the east , the other from the south . These two rivers joined at the base of this mountain to make the river they had been following ; it was their combined waters that they could still hear rushing over the falls a mile behind them . But the sight of this wide fork of rivers stopped Mary in her tracks and threw her into confusion . One of these two forks , she thought , is the New River . But which one ? There were no landmarks in her memory to answer that question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghetel was hovering at her shoulder , waiting , as ever , for her to lead on . Mary knew she must choose one fork or the other immediately , because if the old woman sensed that she was uncertain of the way , she might well grow rebellious again . Mary chose the fork leading right , toward the south , for two reasons . First , it looked to be just a little wider and thus probably was the main rivercourse . Second , because there was no way to get to that other river without crossing this one . And so she led Ghetel down the slope closer to the river bank . She proceeded as if she were absolutely certain they were on the New River . But she knew there would always be a doubt in her mind as to whether that other stream had been the New River , her highway to home . And if I ever find out it was , she thought , it 'll be too late by then . That doubt became a burden , as heavy as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , she was : that other person she was carrying was the Mary Ingles who believed that the stream not taken was the right stream . Her footsteps , heavy and painful enough already , were dragged down with reluctance . And the gorge up which they were moving now was even more gigantic and ominous . Now every ridge they could see came directly to the river 's edge and ended in a sheer cliff dropping fifty to ap270hundred feet to the river , where the current over the centuries had cut under the mountainsides . Ten feet offshore from where Mary and Ghetel now slid and crawled , there were three or four rock chunks in the river , big as ships , with trees growing on top of them . The women were passing under a steep gray cliff now , a hundred feet high , from which those huge monoliths evidently had fallen into the river . Across the river in a shadowy , narrow ravine , a creek poured over a stone ledge and cascaded in twenty-foot leaps down the picturesque , narrow notch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place Mary would have lingered hours to gaze at under any other circumstances . Now , in her frightened and doubtful state of mind , things of great beauty saddened her . Ghetel was coming along automatically now , stumbling a few yards , sitting down to rest and rub her feet , talking to herself . She had not said a word about the pounding Mary had given her with the stick at the falls . She seemed to be retreating into herself , drawing a - cloak of resistance around herself to shut out the miserable realities of their plight . I could do that too , Mary thought , if I had but to follow ; if I need n't think . That other river back there , she thought . Oh , that haunts me !  |p271IN  the three days since they had passed the falls , they had found nothing to eat . They had seen hickory trees and walnut trees and oaks high on the slopes above , but invariably , on climbing to them , they found nothing but a few broken shells . Squirrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp plants with succulent roots up here in this stony gorge because there was no still water anywhere . All the rain that fell and all the sleet that melted poured down steep rivulets into creeks , raced over shallow brown rock-and-pebble streambeds and plunged over ledges into this river , which hurried recklessly down its zigzag course as if desperate to get out of these high Alleghenies and down into the stately O-y-o , now more than a hundred miles behind . There were not even any worms now . There was no soil at the river 's edge , only rock . And up the slopes , the ground had hardened with cold ; if there were earthworms in it , they had burrowed deep . There were fish in the river and the creeks : big , swift , beautiful fast-water fish , but they were not like a catfish , to lie lazily on a shallow bottom inviting a spear ; they were darters , seen in a flash and gone deep ; and Mary had nothing with which to make a serviceablefishhook . Even if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bait . And even if she had had a fishhook and bait , she probably would have had no patience to sit and fish . She was driven and tormented by her uncertainty about this river . She could notp272rest in this thundering gorge , not knowing whether it was the New River or not . She had decided to give herself six days to turn up a landmark , any landmark she would remember having seen before the Indians had set off overland . If she did not see anything she recognized by then , she would contrive some means to get across this river  --  floating on a log or something , whatever the risk  --  and would go back down to that river that had led up to the east and follow it until she recognized something . She had grown that desperate . She was sure they had walked six hundred miles or more since they had fled from the Indians . To have come six hundred miles through a hostile wilderness and suffered such hardships , all in vain , would prove a God too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would scowl at the wintry sky several times a day and demand to know why a decent woman like herself had been thrown into this dank and thundering hell-pit . There were not even birds in this gorge , it seemed . She could remember seeing no small woodland birds since passing the falls ; this was a craggy land fit only for hawks and eagles and vultures , all of which she had seen diving from cliff-tops or wheeling over the gorge . You could not throw a rock up there and knock one down to eat . Likely you could not even bring one down with a rifle . She had seen wild turkeys at a distance , but they were nervous and impossible to approach . And the forest animals were simply too wary and agile to kill for food without a gun . In these three days above the falls they had glimpsed a fox , three wolves , or one wolf three times , a blazing-eyed lynx crouched on a bluff looking down at them from twenty feet above , an elk on the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had glimpsed the face of some cat-creature , as big as the face of a man , in a clump of bushes five feet ahead of them , before it disappeared with a swish and a rustle . They had not seen any bears for weeks , which was all right with her . The cold weather had also retired the snakes . That 's just as well for the snakes , Mary thought , as I 'd stone one and eat ' im now if I could find one . Ghetel had groaned all night ; neither of them had slept . The night had seemed a year long . Mary , herself eaten up inside with cramps and gnawings , had fallen into spells from time to time , inp273which she would be looking at the cold stars glittering above the cliff-tops , then would be awakened , by a shudder or a fibrillation of her heart , to the realization that she was still looking at the cold stars but that she had not been seeing them for a while . And Ghetel would still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or would suddenly jerk her knees up and curl herself into a ball , hugging herself , her bony knees slamming into Mary 's side . And then the blanket , which had been arranged so carefully over them to keep all their limbs covered , would be pulled askew and Mary would have to sit up , shivering , to rearrange it and tuck in its edges . During those hours , she would think of virtually nothing but the tragic loss of Ghetel 's blanket . In those early morning hours with the frost seeming to fall on them directly from the bitter blue-white stars , the loss of that blanket would grow in her mind to be the greatest of their misfortunes , greater than the loss of the tomahawk , greater than their want of food , greater than their need of shoes . In the daytime her great preoccupation would be that awful growing certainty that they were on the wrong river , and that they would perish before having a chance to verify and correct their mistake . It must be a simple matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest misfortune is always the same : that we 're starved nigh to death . Mary felt , as she had been feeling all night , the pebbles of the narrow beach grinding against her fleshless bones , even through the crushed bed of moss and drift leaves they had laid down , and she thought : William might well not even know me if he saw me now . Surely I scarce weigh six stone anymore . Her stomach gripped . She drew her legs up and squinted against the pain and drew cold air through her clenched teeth , and the cold air on her teeth sent needles of pain through her face , into her eyeballs . Her gums were rotting and her teeth were loose and sensitive to cold , even to biting . It was an agony to drink water , and chew a root . And another strange thing had happened to her , something she had realized one long , sleepless , thoughtful night somewhere along the way , one night when she had been going one by one over thep274effects of the ordeal : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she ought to have had her monthlies by now . She had gone through them once since the baby 's birth , while she was still in captivity , but she should have had them once again , just a few days ago . It was good not to have the bother of them , of course , but still they were something her body always had done when it was supposed to , and now it was , she suspected , a sign , along with the loose teeth and the swollen joints and the constant coldness and the periods of distorted vision and unclear thinking , a sign that she was truly starving  --  not just desperately hungry , but starving . She thought about these things and waited for the daylight , though she now felt such an overwhelming lassitude that she did n't know whether she could even get to her feet , come morning  --  or why she should . It was doubly hard to think about getting up and moving now that she suspected she was following the wrong river  --  and perhaps going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky had turned peach-colored above the walls of the chasm . Now Mary could see the rivercourse again , could see the boulders and shrubs gradually set themselves out from the massive silhouettes of the cliffs , and the hopelessness of the night receded into the back of her mind again as it did every morning when she could look up the river and see their way . It took her five minutes to stand up . First she would sit up with a groan . Then she would fold a leg a little at a time , wincing , then the other leg , until both feet were flat on the ground . Then she would push her weight forward or pull on a limb until her weight was on her feet . Then she would squat there a while , resting , moaning at the stabs of pain in her knees and feet and hips , until she was ready to haul herself to a standing position . Some mornings , if there was nothing to hold onto and lift herself , she would turn over onto her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as if her leg and ankle and hip joints froze in the night . It was like breaking them loose every morning . Then after she had helped Ghetel get up , and had walked gasping a few hundred feet ,  |p275the  joints would stop grinding and shooting their pains through her , and she would be ready for another day 's going . The desultory clunking of Ghetel 's bell bothered Mary now . Now that her head was in a fuddle over this dubious maze of rivers , the hell seemed a silly thing , a stupid indulgence . But she ought to wear a bell , Mary joked grimly to herself sometimes ; she is , after all , such a mule . This morning they came to a place where the river curved away to their left . Along the outside of its curve , where they were now limping along , the river had carved its way into the base of a high cliff . There was a stretch of several hundred feet ahead of them where the water swirled along right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the roiling water and the stone wall to walk . Mary stopped and studied it . They had come to such places every day since the falls . There were only two ways , sometimes only one , to get past these places . Either was horrible in its particular way . She tried the direct way first . Steeling herself against the cold and clutching at handholds in the sheer stone , she probed the water with the hickory pole in her left hand . She felt a rock bottom . It was shallow enough here for a first step . She stepped down into the water ; she felt the shock of it shoot up into her chest and make her heart skip . Then she probed ahead with the pole again and found another solid place . She put her left foot on it and then brought her right foot over . The icy water was swirling around her hips now , and she moved her right hand from one crevice to another , then reached out again with the pole . It found no bottom this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . She shifted her grip to the upper end of the pole and shoved it farther down until her hand was in the river . The whole length of the pole was underwater and was touching nothing . That meant it was over her head and they could not wade along the base of the cliff and would therefore have to do it the other way . The cold water was seizing up her joints again . She turned her face back along the cliff and started inching her way back across the distance she had come . Ghetel was sitting there in the blanket , as if in a stupor , just waiting to be told what to do . Mary climbed back ontop276the bank , shaking violently . She had to struggle briefly with Ghetel to get the blanket , and wrapped herself in it . " Let 's go back a ways , " she said . " We 've got to climb this'n , I 'm afraid . " Ghetel got up and followed without question , her bell clunking dismally ; she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or the other . They went back beyond the place where they had slept . Every step back was twice as hard as any step in the right direction , and Mary would almost despair whenever she had to expend her waning strength backtracking from a dead end . Mary found a place at last where they could start up the slope , a place where there were roots and rocks to haul themselves up by , to climb the mountain and pass over above the cliff . They spent the rest of the morning on this passage . They could go only a few feet before stopping to slump against a tree trunk or to lie face down against the slope hanging by roots to get their breath while their legs twitched and trembled from the strain . They would stop when the dizziness came , when the huge rampart they were ascending would seem to waver and tilt and threatened to dump them off into the dark river below . Then they moved across the lip of the cliff , scooting and sliding rather than walking , afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would faint and fall off through space . There were evergreen trees up here , dark green , carpeting the scrabbly soil with their fallen needles . The women sat for a while on this carpet , warmed by the sun , and seemed to be able to breathe more deeply up here than down in the confining , shadowy valley with its dank air . Up here the noise of the river was a whisper instead of a roar , and the sky was like new blue steel and seemed almost close enough to reach up and touch . Mary felt a strange lightness , almost an elation , and pressed herself tighter to earth against the feeling that she might simply float off in the wind . Strands of her hair blew across her face . She was startled by a voice . It was Ghetel . It was the first thing Ghetel had said in days without first being spoken to . She said : " I vant to be an iggle . " Mary was pleased . Ghetel 's mind seemed somehow to have sur/faced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her with a smile . " Aye . Likewise . " Ghetel was grinning a strange , wild grin . " I vould fly down , " she said , in a crackling voice , holding her hands curved like talons ; then she added , clamping the talons suddenly , very hard , on Mary 's upper arm : " and GET YOU ! " She grinned crazily and clutched and shook Mary 's arm , tugging and shoving at it with those bony , unbelievably strong fingers . The bell clanked with her motions . Mary was alarmed . The grip hurt , but Mary was afraid to struggle , on this high place , with a grinning , fierce-eyed woman who possibly believed herself to be an eagle . Mary forced a smile . " And why would you get me ? " " Because . . . I am hungry ! " She nodded violently , still wideeyed , still clutching the arm . " But I 'm your friend . " Ghetel shook the arm to and fro a moment , then said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why am I bad ? " " Bad voman , " Ghetel said , squeezing the arm harder , " you ate your baby . " Mary 's mouth fell agape . " What say you ? " Ghetel stuck her jaw forward so that her lower teeth were in front of the upper , and seesawed her jaw from side to side , wrinkling her nose . " You ate your baby . You had a baby . I know . Now it is all gone . " Mary jerked her arm out of the clutch . " I did NOT ! " The hands grabbed her again . Mary pulled , shouting : " I did no such a thing , madwoman ! " " Den I ate your baby . " She let go of Mary 's arm suddenly and looked sad . Mary tightened her other hand on the hickory stick to be ready , but hoped to talk Ghetel out of this spell . " Why 'd you do that ? " she asked . " Hungry . " " Eh , well . " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made her own left hand hard like an eagle 's claws and grabbed Ghetel 's arm and squeezed as tightly as she could , digging her broken , jagged fingernails in hard . " I am hungry , too , " she said in a harsh voice . " Remember that ! "  |p278Ghetel  's eyes suddenly went shrewd . She looked at Mary 's eyes until stared down , then looked down at Mary 's hand on her arm . " It hurts , " she said . " Well I know . " Ghetel winced , then put her hand on Mary 's hand and tried to remove it . After a moment , Mary let go , and sat looking at Ghetel , alert . The old woman seemed to have been subdued . She would not look in Mary 's eyes . " So now , " Mary said . " Let 's get off this mountain and go on . " And they did . But Mary could not shake the old woman 's crazed and awful words out of her mind . Yesterday Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , into hell . And today Ghetel , speaking in unearthly tones on a mountaintop , had said Mary was a bad woman . Because of the baby , she had said . The old woman was tetched , of course . But it is said that the tetched know God . For a mile or so after coming down from the mountain that afternoon , they had comparatively easy going . They were in the inside of a bend in the river now , and the river had deposited a few hundred yards of silt and gravel along the base of a mountain . The other side of the river was another undercut cliff . The curving beach was overgrown with shrubs and there was a low place where the mouth of a backwater had silted up ; in this stale pool they found a stand of reeds , and hobbled over to pull them up and muck about for their roots . The yield , after they had all but turned the slough upside down , was a dozen black-skinned , fingersizedtubers which , when snapped in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the repulsive dark covering as they could , and then , teeth aching , they masticated the crunchy , tastelessflesh as if it were the finest delicacy . Two more of Ghetel 's front teeth came out in the mass , and she picked them out and put them on the ground . The longer they chewed the pulp , the bigger it became . Soon their shrunken stomachs were turgid with the mass they had swallowed ; a few minutes of near-nausea followed , and theyp279kept swallowing it back until it subsided . Mary had been unable to eat the last one of the tubers , and she secreted it in her hand for later as they left , smeared with cold mud but almost happy , and continuedup the bank toward the next bend in the river . Mary was singing , but just above a whisper . Over the hush of wind and water they began detecting a low rumble . It was a familiar sound , a dreaded sound . Ghetel looked terrified , and stopped where she stood on the narrow spit of land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary said . " No fear . Likely we can climb right past this'n . " She was not going to make the mistake of getting wedged in as she had at the other falls , even if she had to climb a mile-high mountain to get around it . As they worked their way into the bend of the river , they saw an enormous black bird swoop low over the shore a few yards ahead and disappear on the other side of a huge rock . Eagle , Mary thought at first . But then a shadow flickered over their path . Looking up , she saw another great dark bird , descending on graceful outstretched wings turned up at the tips . A buzzard . It was a moment before she remembered the meaning of buzzards : there would be something dead up there . " Hurry , " she said . There were three buzzards there , hunched over something small , working on it , now and then pushing one another aside , beating each other with their wings , hobbling awkwardly on the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast , seething , churning pool of water and the right edge of a waterfall visible around the bend . Sunlight striking the rising mist made a fragment of rainbow at the river 's edge . Mary plucked up her courage and hobbled over the rock shouting , " Hey , hey ! " at the buzzards and swinging her stick . The birds arched their wings and stumbled about , then beat the air and rose off , one at a time . The object of their attention lay near the edge of a slanting table of rock where it had been washed up : a little mass of dark fur , tornp280open to show tattered pale flesh and white bone . It appeared to have been a muskrat or some such thing , probably killed by a plunge over the waterfall . It was not fresh , and the buzzards had been at it for a while , leaving little . It was tainted with the contents of its own shredded bowels . Mary squatted at the water 's edge and washed the little wreck of a carcass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extracted the little flesh the buzzards had left . This amounted to two or three ounces of flesh and organs for Ghetel and a like amount for herself . There are some things I sha n't want to tell back home when I get there , Mary thought . Leaving my babe with a squaw , for one . And eating after buzzards . But truly I 'm not a bad woman , Heavenly Lord . Or thou 'd not have give me meat . Thank'ee , 0 Lord , she thought , remembering to give grace only after she had eaten . This waterfall was as beautiful as the other had been fearsome . Perhaps it was the sunny day , the shaft of rainbow leaning above it . Perhaps it was that they were looking at it with a little something in their stomachs . The river was wide here , came flowing broad and smooth down from a curve between gently sloping hills and then spilled twenty or thirty feet over the great crooked stone sill of the falls , foaming and misting and thundering onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pool at its base . And this cascade would be easier to bypass . A heap of boulders lay where the falls swept past the shore , and these could be climbed to put the women on the upper level of the river . They lifted and pulled themselves up these and in ten minutes were above the falls . The mountainside they were traversing now was steep but not precipitous , and they were able to walk upright most of the time , not having to hang on with their hands . They . were passing through a magnificent forest of beech , hickory , oak and ash now , on a floor of dead leaves , now and then veering to skirt some massive outcroppingof solid rock , green with moss and splotched with blue-green lichen . They were shuffling through dry leaves on that forest floor , alongsidejust such a subtly colored bluff , when the strange sweatingp281started . Mary felt her skin prickling all over . Her vision blurred as sweat ran into her eyes . When she wiped her hand across her brow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanks . Her face kit hot just under the skin but icy on the surface . And the hues of the mottled rocks faded suddenly , everything going white and shadowless . Her heartbeat was racing . Suddenly her knees went limber and she sat down abruptly . Her stomach hurt  --  no more than it had been hurting for weeks , but differently . It was as if someone were inside it stabbing outward with a sharp object . Her stomach contractedhard with each pain , making her bend forward . Ghetel had stopped beside her , and was looking down at her , but her face was not clear ; it was as if in silhouette . " Ghetel ! I . . . I think we shouldn't 've et those roots . Ah ! Ah ! Share me th ' blanket , would y ' please ? Oh ! Oh , dear heaven . You feel it too ? Oh ! OH ! " She doubled over and her forehead touched her knees . Ghetel knelt by Mary and saw that she was shivering visibly . Her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sheen of perspiration . Ghetel knelt beside her , confused , and drew her inside the blanket with her . She held her there and looked around her at the trackless woods , the ranks of dark mountains stretching away up the rivercourse . When Mary was not moving ahead , Ghetel had no notion of where to go or what to do . She knelt there and hugged the convulsing young woman to her , while the sun descended behind a ridge and left them in chilly blue shadows . The other shore of the river was bathed in a creamy , rosy glow of winter sunlight , and that glow diminished upward as the sun descended . It was during this time that Ghetel too began to wince with stomach pains and feel dizzy and wet . She slowly keeled over , drawing Mary to the ground with her , and they lay there on the leafy slope for a measureless time as the valley darkened . After a while they began feeling a powerful backing-up of pressure in their chests . Mary began heaving first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies were trying to get rid of the alien matter in their stomachs . They retched dryly for a long time , retched and moaned , shiveringand drooling uncontrollably . Night came , unnoticed . There were blank spaces in time , then moments of feverish , **25;8684;TOOLONG , then more cold blank spaces . Sometimes Mary would come to and be aware of Ghetel writhing beside her , of her own tripping heartbeat and stomach spasms , of the profuse watering from her mouth and nose , of the darkness and the cold , the sound of the river , the tilt of her body as she lay on the slope . Once she saw , or imagined she saw , the face of a wolf in the starlight a few feet away . Then she would dream of falling  --  soaring , rather  --  from high , bright places . Her head ached . The stars were brilliant . There was a hard , heavy knot in her stomach , as if she had swallowed a stone , but she was no longer heaving . Her throat was raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like wool and tasting like soap . She had never in her life felt so weak and shaky . Her lower body felt as if it were full of hot water . The poison of the roots , whatever they were , seemed to have spent itself , and she presumed that she would be all right now  --  though the bowels had yet to be heard from before she could say it was all over . Ghetel was sleeping , breathing heavily beside her , sometimes murmuring incoherent words . The blanket was in disarray . The ground was sparkling with frost and Mary 's legs were uncovered , stinging with cold . She tugged at the blanket until she and Ghetel both were covered as well as they could be , and the next awareness she had was of pale pink light over the mountain on the other side of the river . She could feel the damp cold coming up from the ground , permeating her flesh , making her bones ache . She lay there shivering , waiting for sufficient daylight to move by , and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it had been before the poisoning had dispersed her senses . This , she remembered , was to have been the day when , if she had not yet seen a familiar landmark , she was going to try to cross this river and go back down the other bank to that other river that had beckoned so strongly to her premonitions , the river just above the first falls . But how am I to do that when I 'm doubtful I can even get me up off the ground ? she thought . How can I cross the river here ? It 's still wide and wild and I 've not the strength to ride a log across . Andp283we 're too close to the falls . We 'd be dashed in the falls afore we 'd get halfway across . Maybe we could go back below the falls and put in a log and hang on it , she thought . Nay , she argued . We 'd be beat to death on the rapids . We might even get carried all the way down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this river and y 'd have to go where the river takes it . It was some days to get from that falls to this one but I reckon if you were floatin ' a log y 'd be swept back down to ' em in a few hours . She felt the worst wave of helpless frustration she had experienced at any step along this endless , aching , soul-crushing journey . There 's just nought to do but go on up this one and find a ford , she thought . It 's just another o ' these eternal walk-arounds , and from the looks o ' this river it could well be a hundred-mile walkaround . The night 's sickness had left them so weak and cold and shaky that they had to support each other when they finally arose with the dawn and started on up the river bank . They trudged awkwardly along , the blanket drawn over their shoulders , leaning on each other , their legs limber and wobbly , hands palsied , and sometimes when one started to cave in , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held each other up , they brought each other down . The toil of moving eventually worked out the shaky hollowness left by the poison and replaced it with the old familiar aches . About midmorning Mary 's bowels got out of control and she squatted moaning by the wayside every few minutes , groaning and spewing out the scouring fluid , while wave after wave of shivers ran down from her temples to her thighs . As if following Mary 's leadership even in this , Ghetel was soon having to stop every hundred yards to suffer the same miserable scouring . Each such stop left them feeling colder and more exhausted . There was an eerie kind of lightheadedness now , and a distortion of time , as if the roots had drugged them . Mary would look at an object , a tree or a chunk of rock , a few hundred feet ahead ; then she would walk , her mind full of thoughts as light and formless as clouds , for what seemed an hour , and then when she **31;8711;TOOLONG know exactly what , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Without looking at Harry , Campbell holds out a glass which has become empty , as has Pru 's little glass of creme de menthe . The green of it has all gone into her eyes . The minister is telling her , and Nelson , " Truly , under some circumstances , even for the most devout it can be the appropriate recourse . At a later date , the wedding can be consecrated in a church ; we see a numbernow of these reaffirmations of wedding vows . " " Why do n't they just keep living in sin right here ? " Harry asks . " We do n't mind . " " We do indeed , " Ma says , sounding smothered . " Hey Dad , " Nelson calls , " could you bring me another beer ? " " Get it yourself . My hands are full . " Yet he stops in front of Pru and takes up the little liqueur glass . " Sure it 's good for the baby ? " She looks up with an unexpected coldness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him are frozen grass . " Oh yes , " she tells him . " It 's the beer and wine that are bad ; they bloat you . " By the time Rabbit returns from the kitchen , Campbell is allowinghimself to be brought around . He has what they want . a church wedding , a service acceptable in the eyes of the Grace Stuhls of this world . Knowing this , he is in no hurry . Beneath the girlish lashes his eyes are as dark as Janice 's and Ma 's , the Koerner eyes . Ma Springer is holding forth , the little rounded toes of her aqua sneakers bouncing . " You must take what the boy says with a grain of salt . At his age I did n't know what I believed myself , I thought the government was foolish and the gangsters had the right idea . This was back in Prohibition days . " Nelson looks at her with his own dark eyes , sullen . " Mommom , if it matters so much to you , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does Pru think ? " Harry asks , giving her her poison . He wonders if the girl 's frozen stiffness of manner , and those little waits while her smile gets unstuck , are n't simply fear : it isp201she who is growing another life within her body , and nobody else . " I think , " she responds slowly , so quietly the room goes motionless to hear , " it would be nicer in a church . " Nelson says , " I know I sure do n't want to go down to that awful new concrete City Hall they 've built behind where the Bijou used to be , some guy I know was telling me the contractorraked off a million and there 's cracks in the cement already . " Janice in her relief says , " Harry , I could use some more Campari . " Campbell lifts his replenished glass from his low place on the hassock . " Cheers , good people . " He states his terms : " The customaryprocedure consists of at least three sessions of counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose we can consider the interview . " As he addresses Nelson particularly , Harry hears a seductive note enrich the great mellow voice . " Nelson , the church does not expect that every couple it marries be a pair of Christian saints . It does ask that the participants have some understanding of what they are undertaking . I do n't take the vows ; you and Teresa do . Marriage is not merely a rite ; it is a sacrament , an invitation from God to participate in the divine . And the invitation is not for one moment only . Every day you share is meant to be sacramental . Can you feel a meaning in that ? There were wonderful words in the old prayer book ; they said that marriage was not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly ; but reverently , discreetly , advisedly , soberly , and in the fear of God . ' " He grins , having intoned this , and adds , " The new prayer book omits the fear of God . " Nelson whines , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little prim , " How long would these sessions of instructions take ? " It is like she is sitting , in that straight-backed dining-room chair , on an egg that might hatch too soon ; Harry tells himself he should try to fuck her tonight , just to keep her loose.  | " Oh , " Campbell says , rolling his eyes toward the ceiling , " I should think , considering the various factors , we could get three of them in in two weeks . I just happen , the officious clergyman said , to have my appointment book here . " Before reaching into the breast pocket of the seersucker coat , Campbelltaps out the bowl of his pipe with a finicky calm that conveysto Harry the advantages of being queer : the world is just a gag to this guy . He walks on water ; the mud of women , of making babies , never dirties his shoes . You got to take off your hat : nothing touches him . That 's real religion . Some rebellious wish to give him a poke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prompts Harry to say , " Yeah , we want to get ' em in before the baby comes . He 'll be here by Christmas . " " God willing , " Campbell smiles , adding , " He or she . " " January , " Pru says in a whisper , after putting down her glass . Harry ca n't tell if she is pleased or displeased by the gallantway he keeps mentioning the baby , that everybody else wants to ignore . While the appointments are being set up she and Nelson sit on that sofa like a pair of big limp Muppets , with invisible arms coming up through the cushions into their torsos and heads . " Fred had his birthday in January , " Ma Springer announces , grunting as she tries to get out of the Barcalounger , to see the minister off . " Oh Mother , " Janice says . " One twelfth of the world has January birthdays . " " I was born in January , " Archie Campbell says , rising . He grins to show his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . My parents were ancient . It 's a wonder I 'm here at all . " The next day a warm rain is beginning to batter the yellowingleaves down from the trees in the park along Cityview Drive as Harry and Nelson drive through Brewer to the lot . The kidp203is still persona non grata but he 's asked to check on the two convertibles he crunched , one of which , the Royale , Manny is repairing . The ' 72 Mercury , hit twice from the side , was more severely damaged , and parts are harder to get . Rabbit 's idea had been when the kid went off to school to sell it for junk and write off the loss . But he did n't have the heart not to let the boy look at the wrecks at least . Then Nelson is going to borrow the Corona and visit Billy Fosnacht before he goes back to Boston to become an endodontist . Harry had a root canal job once ; it felt like they were tickling the underside of his eyeball . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no entirely good way . The Toyota 's windshield wipers keep up a steady rubbery singsong as the Brewer traffic slows , brake lights burning red all along Locust Boulevard . The Castle has started up again and yellow school buses loom ahead in the jam . Harry switches the wipers from Fast to Intermittent and wishes he still smoked cigarettes . He wants to talk to the kid . " Nelson . " " Unhh ? " " How do you feel ? " " O.K. I woke up with a soreness in my throat but I took two of those five-hundred-milligram vitamin Cs Melanie talked Bessie into getting . " " She was really a health nut , was n't she ? Melanie . We still have all that Granola in the kitchen . " " Yeah , well . It was part of her act . You know , mystical gypsy . She was always reading this guru , I forget his name . It sounded like a sneeze . " " You miss her ? " " Melanie ? No , why would I ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implied question . " She was getting pretty grouchy toward the end . " " You think she and Charlie went off together ? " " Beats me , " the boy says . The wipers , now on Intermittent , startle Rabbit each timep204they switch across , as if someone other than he is making decisionsin this car . A ghost . Like in that movie about Encounters of the Third Kind the way the truck with Richard Dreyfuss in it begins to shake all over and the headlights behind rise up in the air instead of pulling off to one side . He readjusts the knob from Intermittent to Slow . " I did n't mean your physical health , exactly . I meant more your state of mind . After last night . " " You mean about that sappy minister ? I do n't mind going over to listen to his garbage a couple times if it 'll satisfy the Springer honor or whatever . " " I guess I mean more about the marriage in general . Nellie , I do n't want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little in the side of Harry 's vision ; the yellow buses ahead pull into the Brewer High driveway and the line of cars begins to move again , slowly , beside a line of parked cars whose rooftops are spattered with leaves the rain has brought down . " Who says I 'm being railroaded ? " " Nobody says it . Pru seems a fine girl , if you 're ready for marriage . " " You do n't think I 'm ready . You do n't think I 'm ready for anything . " He lets the hostility pass , trying to talk meditatively , like Webb Murkett . " You know , Nelson , I 'm not sure any man is ever a hundred per cent ready for marriage . I sure as hell know I was n't , from the way I acted toward your mother . " " Yeah , well , " the boy says , in a voice a little crumbled , from his father 's not taking the bait . " She got her own back . " " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to understand . After we got back together that time , we 've both been pretty straight . We 've even had a fair amount of fun , in our dotage . I 'm just sorry we had so much working out to do , with you still on the scene . " " Yeah , well . " Nelson 's voice sounds breathy and tight , and he keeps looking at his knees , even when Harry hangs that tricky left turn onto Eisenhower Avenue . The boy clears his throat and volunteers , " It 's the times , I guess . A lot of the kidsp205I got to know at Kent , they had horror stories worse than any of mine . " " Except that thing with Jill . They could n't top that , I bet . " He does n't quite chuckle . Jill is a sacred name to the boy ; he will never talk about it . Harry goes on clumsily , as the car gains momentum downhill and the spic and black kids strolling uphill to school insolently flirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " There 's something that does n't feel right to me in this new development . The girl gets knocked up , O.K. , it takes two to tango , you have some responsibility there , nobody can deny it . But then as I understand it she flat out refuses to get the abortion , when one of the good things that 's come along in twenty years along with a lot that 's not so good is you can go have an abortion now right out in the open , in a hospital , safe and clean as having your appendix out . " " So ? " " So why did n't she ? " The boy makes a gesture that Rabbit fears might be an attempt to grab the wheel ; his grip tightens . But Nelson is merely waving to indicate a breadth of possibilities . " She had a lot of reasons . I forget what all they were . " " I 'd like to hear them . " " Well for one thing she said she knew of women who had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have a baby . You say it 's easy as an appendix but you 've never had it done . She did n't believe in it . " " I thought she was n't that much of a Catholic . " " She was n't , she is n't , but still . She said it was n't natural . " " What 's natural ? In this day and age getting knocked up like that is n't natural . " " Well she 's shy , Dad . They do n't call her Pru for nothing . Going to a doctor like that , and having him scrape you out , she just did n't want to do it . " " You bet she did n't . Shy . She wanted to have a baby , and she was n't too shy to manage that . How much younger 're you than she ? "  | " A year . A little more . What does it matter ? It was n't just a baby she wanted to have , it was my baby . Or so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did you think about it ? " " I thought it was O.K. , probably . It was her body . That 's what they all tell you now , it 's their body . I did n't see much I could do about it . " " Then it 's sort of her funeral , is n't it ? " " How do you mean ? " " I mean , " Harry says , in his indignation honking at some kids at the intersection of Plum Street who saunter right out toward him , this early in the school year the crossing guards are n't organized yet , " so she decides to keep pregnant till there 's no correcting it while this other girl babvsits for vou , and your mother and grandmother and now this nance of a minister all decide when and how you 're going to marry the poor broad . I mean , where do you come in ? Nelson Angstrom . I mean , what do you want ? Do you know ? " In his frustration he hits the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the avenue dips down beneath the blackened nineteenth-century stones of the underpass at Eisenhower and Seventh , that in a bad rainstormis flooded but not today . The arch of this underpass , built without a keystone , by masons all long dead , is famous , and from his earliest childhood has reminded Rabbit of a crypt , of death . They emerge among the drooping wet pennants of lowcostfactory outlets . " Well , I want  --  " Fearing the kid is going to say he wants a job at Springer Motors , Harry interrupts : " You look scared , is all I see . Scared to say No to any of these women . I 've never been that great at saying No either , but just because it runs in the family does n't mean you have to get stuck . You do n't necessarily have to lead my life , I guess is what I want to say . " " Your life seems pretty comfy to me . " Cocky and cool , Nelson 's voice has climbed up onto a ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weiser , the forest of the inner-city mall a fogged green smear in the rearview mirror.  | " Yeah , well , " Harry says , " it 's taken me a fair amount of time to get there . And by the time you get there you 're pooped . The world , " he tells his son , " is full of people who never knew what hit ' em , their lives are over before they wake up . " " Dad , you keep talking about yourself but I do n't see what it has to do with me . What can I do with Pru except marry her ? She 's not so bad , I mean I 've known enough girls to know they all have their limits . But she 's a person , she 's a friend . It 's as if you want to deny her to me , as if you 're jealous or something . The way you keep mentioning her baby . " This kid should have been spanked at some point . " I 'm not jealous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Do n't feel sorry for me . Do n't waste your feelings on me . " They pass Schoenbaum Funeral Directors . Nobody out front in this rain . Harry swallows and asks , " Do n't you want out , if we could rig it somehow ? " " How could we rig it ? She 's in her fifth month . " " She could go ahead have the baby without you marrying her . These adoption agencies are crying for white babies , you 'd be doing somebody else a favor . " " Pru would never consent . " " Do n't be too sure . We could ease the pain . She 's one of seven , she knows the value of a dollar . " " Dad , this is crazy talk . You 're forgetting this baby is a person . An Angstrom ! " " Jesus , how could I forget that ? " The light at the foot of Weiser , before the bridge , is red . Harry looks over at his son and gets an impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light turns green . A bronze plaque on a pillar of pebbled concrete names the mayor for whom the bridge was named but it is raining too hard to read it . He starts up again , " Or you could just , I do n't know , not make any decision , just disappear for a while . I 'd give you the money for that . " " Money , you 're always offering me money to stay away . "  | " Maybe because when I was your age I wanted to get away and I could n't . I did n't have the money . I did n't have the sense . We tried to send you away to get some sense and you 've thumbed your nose at it . " " I have n't thumbed my nose , it 's just that there 's not that much out there . It is n't what you think , Dad . College is a rip-off , the professors are teaching you stuff because they 're getting paid to do it , not because it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about geography or whatever any more than you do . It 's all phony , they 're there because parents do n't want their kids around the house past a certain age and sending them to college makes them look good . My little Johnny 's at Haavand . ' My little Nellie 's at Kent . ' " " Really , that 's how you see it ? In my day kids wanted to get out in the world . We were scared but not so scared we kept running back to Mama . And Grandmama . What 're you going to do when you run out of women to tell you what to do ? " " Same thing you 'll do . Drop dead . " DISC O. DATSUN . FUEL ECONOMY . Route 111 has a certain beauty in the rain , the colors and the banners and the bluish asphalt of the parking lots all run together through the swish of traffic , the beat of wipers . Rubbery hands flailing , Help , help . Rabbit has always liked rain , it puts a roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing you caught , " he blurts out to Nelson . " You 're too much me . " Nelson gets loud . " I 'm not you ! I 'm not caught ! " " Nellie , you 're caught . They 've got you and you did n't even squeak . I hate to see it , is all . All I 'm trying to say is , as far as I 'm concerned you do n't have to go through with it . If you want to get out of it , I 'll help you . " " I do n't want to be helped that way ! I like Pru . I like the way she looks . She 's great in bed . She needs me , she thinks I 'm neat . She does n't think I 'm a baby . You say I 'm caught but I do n't feel caught , I feel like I 'm becoming a man ! " Help , help . " Good , " Harry says then . " Good luck . "  | " Where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Where 's that ? " " Here . Stop making it so hard for me to fit in at the lot . " They turn into the lot . The tires of the Corona splash in the gutter water rushing toward its grate along the highway curb . Stonily Rabbit says nothing.  |p210A  NEW SHOP has opened on Weiser Street in one of those scruffy blocks between the bridge and the mall , opposite the enduring old variety store that sells out-of-town newspapers , warm unshelled peanuts , and dirty magazines for queers as well as straights . From the look of it the new store too might be peddling smut , for its showcase front window is thoroughly masked by long thin blond Venetian blinds , and the lettering on its windows is strikingly discreet . Gold letters rimmed in black and very small simply say FISCAL ALTERNATIVES and below that , smaller yet , Old Coins , Silver , and Gold Bought and Sold . Harry passes the place by car every day , and one day , there being two empty metered spaces he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes in . The next day , after some business at his bank , the Brewer Trust two blocks away , he comes out of Fiscal Alternatives with thirty Krugerrands purchasedfor $377.14 each , including commission and sales tax , coming to $11,314.20 . These figures had been run off inside by a girl with platinum hair ; her long scarlet fingernails did n't seem to hamper her touch on the hand computer . She was the onlyp211person visible , at her long glass-topped desk , with beige sides and swivel chair to match . But there were voices and monitoring presences in other rooms , back rooms into which she vanished and from which she emerged with his gold . The coins came in cunning plastic cylinders of fifteen each , with round blue-tinted lids that suggested dollhouse toilet seats ; indeed , bits of what seemed toilet paper were stuffed into the hole of this lid to make the fit tight and to conceal even a glimmer of the sacred metal , So heavy , the cylinders threaten to tear the pockets off his coat as Harry hops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside the front door , Pru sits knitting on the gray sofa and Ma Springer has taken over the Barcalounger to keep her legs up while some quick-lipped high yellow from Philly is giving her the six o'clock news . Mayor Frank Rizzo has once again denied charges of police brutality , he says , in a rapid dry voice that pulls the rug out from every word . Used to be Philadelphia was a distant place where no one dared visit , but television has pulled it closer , put its muggy murders and politics right next door . " Where 's Janice ? " Harry asks . Ma Springer says , " Shh . " Pru says , " Janice took Nelson over to the club , to fill in with some ladies ' doubles , and then I think they were going to go shopping for a suit . " " I thought he bought a new suit this summer . " " That was a business suit . They think he needs a three-piece suit for the wedding . " " Jesus , the wedding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't mind them . Nelson hates them . " " He says that just to get his grandmother going , " Ma Springer calls , twisting to push her voice around the headrest . " I think they 're really doing him good . " Neither woman notices the hang of his coat , though it feels like a bull 's balls tugging at his pockets . It 's Janice he wants . He goes upstairs and snuggles the two dense , immaculate cylinders into the back of his bedside table , in the drawer where he keeps a spare pair of readingp212glasses and the rubber tip on a plastic handle he is supposed to massage his gums with to keep out of the hands of the periodontistand the pink wax earplugs he stuffs in sometimes when he has the jitters and ca n't tune out the house noise . In this same drawer he used to keep condoms , in that interval between when Janice decided the Pill was bad for her and when she went and had her tubes burned , but that was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole tidy tin box of them , after an indication , the lid not quite closed , perhaps he imagined it , that Nelson or somebody had been into the box and filched a couple . From about that time on he began to feel crowded , living with the kid . As long as Nelson was socked into baseball statistics or that guitar or even the rock records that threaded their sound through all the fibers of the house , his occupation of the room down the hall was no more uncomfortable than the persistence of Rabbit 's own childhood in an annex of his brain ; but when the stuff with hormones and girls and cars and beers began , Harry wanted out of fatherhood . Two glimpses mark the limits of his comfort in this matter of men descending from men . When he was about twelve or thirteen he walked into his parents ' bedroom in the half-house on Jackson Road not expectinghis father to be there , and the old man was standing in front of his bureau in just socks and an undershirt , innocently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style that always looked sad and dreary to Harry anyway , and here was his father 's bare behind , such white buttocks , limp and hairless , mute and helpless flesh that squeezed out shit once a day and otherwise hung there in the world like ' linen that had n't been ironed ; and then when Nelson was about the same age , a year older he must have been for they were living in this house already and they moved when the kid was thirteen , Harry had wandered into the bathroom not realizing Nelson would be stepping out of the shower and had seen the child frontally : he had pubic hair and , though his body was still slim and pint-sized , a man-sized prick , heavy and oval , unlike Rabbit 's circumcised and perhaps because of this looking brutal , and big . Big . Thisp213was years before the condoms were stolen . The drawer rattles , stuck , and Harry tries to ease it in , hearing that Janice and Nelson have come into the house , making the downstairs resoundwith news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his news for Janice . To knock her out with it . The drawer suddenly eases shut and he smiles , anticipating her astonished reception of his precious , lustrous , lead-heavy secret . As with many anticipated joys it does not come exactly as envisioned . By the time they climb the stairs together it is later than it should be , and they feel unsettled and high . Dinner had to be early because Nelson and Pru were going over to Soupy , as they both call Campbell , for their third session of counseling . They returned around nine-thirty with Nelson in such a rage they had to break out the dinner wine again while with a beer can in hand he did an imitation of the young minister urging the church 's way into the intimate space between these two . " He keeps talking about the church being the be-riide of Ke-riist . I kept wanting to ask him , Whose little bride are you ? " " Nelson , " Janice said , glancing toward the kitchen , where her mother was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nelson insisted . " What does He do , fuck the church up the ass ? " Pru laughed , Harry noticed . Did Nelson do that to her ? It was about the last thing left a little out of the ordinary for these kids , blowing all over the magazines these days , giving head they call it , there was that movie Shampoo where Julie Christie who you associate with costume dramas all decked out in bonnets announced right on the screen she wanted to blow Warren Beatty , actually said it , and it was n't even an X , it was a simple R , with all these teen-age dating couples sitting there holding hands as sweetly as if it was a rerun of Showboat with Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel , the girls laughing along with the boys . Pru 's long-boned mute body does not declare what it does , nor her pale lips , that in repose have a dry , pursed look , an expression maybe you learn in secretarial school . Great in bed , Nelson had said.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pisses me off . He gets me to say these things I do n't believe and then he grins and acts jolly like it 's all some kind of crappy joke . Mom-mom , how can you and those other old ladies stand him ? " Bessie had come in from the kitchen , her mug of Ovaltine steaming as she stared it steady and her hair pinned tight up against her skull with a net over it all , for bed . " Oh , " she said , " he 's higher than some , and lower than others . At least he does n't choke us on all the incense like the one that became a Greek Orthodox priest finally . And he did a good job of getting the diehards to accept the new form . My tongue still sticks at some of the responses . " Pru offered , " Soupy seemed quite proud that the new service does n't have obey . ' " " People never did obey , I guess they might as well leave it out , " Ma said . Janice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Really you should n't put up such resistance , Nelson . The man is leaning over backwards to give us a church service , and I think from the way he acts he sincerely likes you . He really does have a feel for young people . " " Does he ever , " Nelson said , soft enough for Ma Springer not to hear , then mimicking loudly , " Dear Mater and Pater were aincient . It 's such a whnnnder I got here at all . In case you - Le bunderwhy I have this toadstool look . " " You should n't mind people 's physical appearance , " Janice said . " Oh but Mater , one simply does . " For some while they went on in this way , it was as good as television , Nelson imitating Soupy 's mellow voice , Janice pleading for reason and charity , Ma Springer drifting in some world of her own where the Episcopal Church has presided since Creation ; but Harry felt above them all , a golden man waiting to take his wife upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a rerun of M*A*S*H came on that Nelson wanted to see , the young couple looked tired and harried suddenly , sitting there on thep215sofa , being beaten into one . Already each took an accustomed place , Pru over on the end with the little cherry side table for her creme de menthe and her knitting , and Nelson on the middle cushion with his feet in their button-soled Adidas up on the reproduction cobbler 's bench . Now that he did n't go to the lot he did n't bother to shave every day , and the whiskers came in as reddish bristle on his chin and upper lip but his cheeks were still downy . To hell with this scruffy kid . Rabbit has decided to live for himself . When Janice comes back from the bathroom naked and damp inside her terrycloth robe , he has locked their bedroom door and arranged himself in his underpants on the bed . He calls in a husky and insinuating voice , " Hey . Janice . Look . I bought us something today . " Her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she took the shower to help clear her head . Slowly her eyes focus on his face , which must show an intensity of pleasure that puzzles her . He tugs open the sticky drawer and is himself startled to see the two tinted cylinders sliding toward him , still upright , still there . He would have thought something so dense with preciousnesswould broadcast signals bringing burglars like dogs to a bitch in heat . He lifts one roll out and places it in Janice 's hand ; her arm dips with the unexpected weight , and her robe , untied , falls open . Her thin brown used body is more alluring in this lapsed sheath of rough bright cloth than a girl 's ; he wants to reach in , to where the shadows keep the damp fresh . " What is it , Harry ? " she asks , her eyes widening . " Open it , " he tells her , and when she fumbles too long at the transparent tape holding on the toilet-seat-shaped little lid he pries it off for her with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spills out upon the quilted bedspread the fifteen Krugerrand . Their color is redder than gold in his mind had been . " Gold , " he whispers , holding up close to her face , paired in his palm , two coins , showing the two sides , the profile of some old Boer on one and a kind of antelope on the other.  | " Each of these is worth about three hundred sixty dollars , " he tells her . " Do n't tell your mother or Nelson or anybody . " She does seem bewitched , taking one into her fingers . Her nails scratch his palm as she lifts the coin off . Her brown eyes pick up flecks of yellow . " Is it all right ? " Janice asks . " Where on earth did you get them ? " " A new place on Weiser across from the peanut store that sells precious metals , buys and sells . It was simple . All you got to do is produce a certified check within twenty-four hours after they quote you a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate any time , so all you lose is their six per cent commission and the sales tax , which at the rate gold is going up I 'll have made back by next week . Here . I bought two stacks . Look . " He takes the other thrillingly hefty cylinder from the drawer and undoes the lid and spills those fifteen antelopes slippingly upon the bedspread , thus doubling the riches displayed . The spread is a lightweight Pennsylvania Dutch quilt , small rectangular patches sewed together by patient biddies , graded from pale to dark to form a kind of dimensional effect , of four large boxes having a lighter and darker side . He lies down upon its illusion and places a Krugerrand each in the sockets of his eyes . Through the chill red pressure of the gold he hears Janice say , " My God . I thought only the government could have gold . Do n't you need a license or anything ? " " Just the bucks . Just the fucking bucks , Wonder Woman . " Blind , he feels amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretching the fabric of his Jockey shorts . " Harry . How much did you spend ? " He wills her to lift down the elastic of his underpants and suck , suck until she gags . When she fails to read his mind and do this , he removes the coins and gazes up at her , a dead man reborn and staring . No coffin dark greets his open eyes , just his wife 's out-of-focus face , framed in dark hair damp and stringy from the shower and fringy across the forehead so that Mamie Eisenhower comes to mind . " Eleven thousand five hundredp217more or less , " he answers . " Honey , it was just sitting in the savings account drawing a lousy six per cent . At only six per cent these days you 're losing money , inflation 's running about twelve . The beauty of gold is , it loves bad news . As the dollar sinks , gold goes up . All the Arabs are turning their dollars into gold . Webb Murkett told me all about it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is still examining the coin , stroking its subtle relief , when he wants her attention to turn to him . He has n't had a hard-on just blossom in his pants since he ca n't remember when . Lotty Bingaman days . " It 's pretty , " Janice admits . " Should you be supporting the South Africans though ? " " Why not , they 're making jobs for the blacks , mining the stuff . The advantage of the Krugerrand , the girl at this fiscal alternatives place explained , is it weighs one troy ounce exactly and is easier to deal with . You can buy Mexican pesos if you want , or that little Canadian maple leaf , though there she said it 's so fine the gold dust comes off on your hands . Also I liked the look of that deer on the back . Do n't you ? " " I do . It 's exciting , " Janice confesses , at last looking at him , where he lies tumescent amid scattered gold . " Where are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in thought , and rests on her lower lip . He loves her when she tries to think . " In your great big cunt , " he says , and pulls her down by the lapels of her rough robe . Out of deference to those around them in the house  --  Ma Springer just a wall 's thickness away , her television a dim rumble , the Korean War turned into a joke  --  Janice tries to suppress her cries as he strips the terrycloth from her slippery body and the coins on the bedspread come in contact with her skin . The cords of her throat tighten ; her face darkens as she strains in the grip of indignation and glee . His underwear off , the overhead light still on , his prick up like a jutting piece of pink wreckage , he calms her into lying motionlessand places a Krugerrand on each nipple , one on her navel ,  |p218and  a number on her pussy , enough to mask the hair with a triangle of unsteady coins overlapping like snake scales . If she laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kneeling at her hips , Harry holds a Krugerrand by the edge as if to insert it in a slot . " No ! " Janice protests , loud enough to twitch Ma Springer awake through the wall , loud enough to jar loose the coins so some do spill between her legs . He hushes her mouth with his and then moves his mouth south , across the desert , oasis to oasis , until he comes to the ferny jungle , which his wife lays open to him with a humoring toss of her thighs . A kind of interest compounds as , seeing red , spilled gold pressing on his forehead , he hunts with his tongue for her clitoris . He finds what he thinks is the right rhythm but does n't feel it take ; he thinks the bright overhead light might be distracting her and risks losing his hard-on in hopping from the bed to switch it off over by the door . Turning then in the half-dark he sees she has turned also , gotten up onto her knees and elbows , a four-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in the gloom as her face peeks around one shoulder . He fucks her in this positiongently , groaning in the effort of keeping his jism in , lettinghis thoughts fly far . The pennant race , the recent hike in the factory base price of Corollas . He fondles her underside 's defenselessslack flesh , his own belly massive and bearing down . Her back looks so breakable and brave and narrow  --  the long dent of its spine , the cross-bar of pallor left by her bathing-suit bra . Behind him his bare feet release a faraway sad odor . Coins jingle , slithering in toward their knees , into the depressions their interlocked weights make in the mattress . He taps her ass and asks , " Want to turn over ? " " Uh-huh . " As an afterthought : " Want me to sit on you first ? " " Uh-huh . " As an afterthought : " Do n't make me come . " Harry 's skin is bitten as by ice when he lies on his back . The coins : worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janice straddles him , vast and globular in the patchy light that filters from the streetlight through the big copper beech . Shep219picks up a stray coin and places it glinting in her eye , as a monocle . Lording it over him , holding him captive , she grinds her wet halves around him ; self to self , bivalve and tuber , this is what it comes to . " Do n't come , " she says , alarmed enough so that her mock-monocle drops to his tense abdomen with a thud . " Better get underneath , " he grunts . Her body then seems thin and black , silhouetted by the scattered circles , reflecting according to their tilt . Gods bedded among stars , he gasps in her ear , then she in his . After this payoff , regaining their breaths , they can count in the semi-dark only twenty-nine Krugerrands on the rumpled bedspread , its landscape of ridged green patches . He turns on the overhead light . It hurts their eyes . By its harshness their naked skins seem also rumpled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest until , naked on his knees on the rug , a late strand of spunk looping from his reddened glans , he finds , caught in the crack between the mattress and the bed side-rail , the precious thirtieth . He stands with Charlie gazing out at the bleak September light . The tree over beyond the Chuck Wagon parking lot has gone thin and yellow at its top ; above its stripped twigs the sky holds some diagonal cirrus , bands of fat in bacon , promising rain tomorrow . " Poor old Carter , " Harry says . " D' ya see where he nearly killed himself running up some mountain in Maryland ? " " He 's pushing , " Charlie says . " Kennedy 's on his tail . " Charlie has returned from his two weeks ' vacation with a kiss of Florida tan undermined by some essential pallor and maybe by the days intervening . He did not come from Florida directly . Simultaneouslywith his return Monday a card sent from Ohio arrived at Springer Motors , saying in his sharply slanted book-keeper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gt . Smokies . Southern belles , mile after mile . Now near Akron , exploded radial capital of the world . Fuel economy a no-no out here , big fins &; V-8s still reign . Miss you all lots . Chas . The joke especially for Harry was on the other side : a picture of a big flat-roofed building like a quarter of a pie , identifiedas KENT STATE STUDENT COMPLEX , embracing the largest openstacklibrary in northeastern Ohio . " Sort of pushing yourself these days , are n't you ? " Harry asks him . " How was Melanie all that while ? " " Who says I was with Melanie ? " " You did . With that card . Jesus , Charlie , a young kid like that grinding your balls could kill you . " " What a way to go , huh champ ? You know as well as I do it 's not the chicks that grind your balls , it 's these middle-aged broads time is running out on . " Rabbit remembers his bout with Janice amid their gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? " " We moved around . Sarasota , Venice , St. Pete 's . I could n't talk her out of the Atlantic side so we drove over from Naples on 75 , old Alligator Alley , and did the shmeer  --  Coral Gables , Ocean Boulevard , up to Boca and West Palm . We were going to take in Cape Canaveral but ran out of time . The bimbo did n't even bring a bathing suit , the one we bought her was one of these new ones with the sides wide open . Great figure . Do n't know why you did n't appreciate her . " " I could n't appreciate her , it was Nelson brought her into the house . It 'd be like screwing your own daughter . " Charlie has a toothpick left over from lunch downtown , ap221persimmon-colored one , and he dents his lower lip with it as he gazes out the tired window . " There 's worse things , " he offers bleakly . " How 's Nelson and the bride-to-be ? " " Pru . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of his trip , to make him pull them out one by one . Miles of Southern belles . Fuck this guy . Rabbit has secrets too . But , thinking this , he can picture only a farm , its buildings set down low in a hollow . " Melanie had a lot to say about Pru . " " Like what ? " " Like she thinks she 's weird . Her impression is that shy as she seems she 's a tough kid up from a really rocky upbringing and is n't too steady on her feet , emotionally speaking . " " Yeah well some might say a girl who gets her kicks screwing an old crow like you is pretty weird herself . " Charlie looks away from the window straight up into his eyes , his own eyes behind their tinted spectacles looking watery . " You should n't say things like that to me , Harry . Both of us getting on , two guys just hanging in there ought to be nice to each other . " Harry wonders from this if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tail . Charlie continues , " Ask me whatever you want about Melanie . Like I said , she 's a good kid . Solid , emotionally . The trouble with you , champ , is you have screwing on the brain . My biggest kick was showing this young woman something of the world she had n't seen before . She ate it up  --  the cypresses , that tower with the chimes . She said she 'd still take California though . Florida 's too flat . She said if this Christmas I could get my ass out to Carmel she 'd be happy to show me around . Meet her mother and whoever else is around . Nothing heavy . " " How much  --  how much future you think you two have ? " " Harry , I do n't have much future with anybody . " His voice is whispery , barely audible . Harry would like to take it and wirebrush it clean.  | " You never know , " he reassures the smaller man . " You know , " Stavros insists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If life offers you something , take it . " " O.K. , O.K. I will . I do . What 'd your poor old mother do , while you were bombing around with Bimbo in the Ever-glades ? " " Well , " he says , " funny thing there . A female cousin of mine , five or so years younger , I guess has been running around pretty bad , and her husband kicked her out this summer , and kept the kids . They lived in Norristown . So Gloria 's been living in an apartment by herself out on Youngquist a couple blocks away and was happy to babysit for the old lady while I was off and says she 'll do it again any time . So I have some freedom now I did n't used to have . " Everywhere , it seems to Harry , families are breaking up and different pieces coming together like survivors in one great big lifeboat , while he and Janice keep sitting over there in Ma Springer 's shadow , behind the times . " Nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't abuse it now . You asked about Nelson . The wedding 's this Saturday . Immediate family only . Sorry . " " Wow . Poor little Nellie . Signed , sealed , and delivered . " Harry hurries by this . " From what Janice and Bessie let drop the mother will probably show up . The father 's too sore . " " You should see Akron , " Charlie tells him . " I 'd be sore too if I had to live there . " " Is n't there a golf course out there where Nicklaus holds a tournament every year ? " " What I saw was n't any golf course . " Charlie has come back from his experiences tenderized , nostalgicit seems for his life even as he lives it . So aged and philosophicalhe seems , Harry dares ask him , " What 'd Melanie think of me , did she say ? " A very fat couple are prowling the lot , looking at the little cars , testing by their bodies , sitting down on air beside the driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlie watches this couple move among the glittering roofsp223and hoods a minute before answering . " She thought you were neat , except the women pushed you around . She thought about you and her balling but got the impression you and Janice were very solid . " " You disillusion her ? " " Could n't . The kid was right . " " Yeah how about ten years ago ? " " That was just cement . " Harry loves the way he ticks this off , Janice 's seducer ; he loves this savvy Greek , dainty of heart beneath his coat of summer checks . The couple have wearied of trying on cars for size and get into their old car , a ' 77 Pontiac Grand Prix with ivory hardtop , and drive away . Harry asks suddenly , " How do you feel about it ? Think we can live with Nelson over here ? " Charlie shrugs , a minimal brittle motion . " Can he live with me ? He wants to be a cut above Jake and Rudy , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 've told them , Charlie , if you go I go . " " You ca n't go , Chief . You 're family . Me , I 'm old times . I can go . " " You know this business cold , that 's what counts with me . " " Ah , this is n't selling . It 's like supermarkets now : it 's shelfstacking , and ringing it out at the register . When it was all used , we used to try to fit a car to every customer . Now it 's take it or leave it . With this seller 's market there 's no room to improvise . Your boy had the right idea : go with convertibles , antiques , something with a little amusement value . I ca n't take these Jap bugs seriously . This new thing called the Tercel we 're supposed to start pushing next month , have you seen the stats ? One point five liter engine , twenty-inch tires . It 's like those little cars they used to have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses . " " Forty-three m.p.g. on the highway , that 's the stat people care about , the way the world 's winding . " Charlie says , " You do n't see too many bugs down in Florida . The old folks are still driving the big old boats , the Continentals ,  |p224the  Toronados , they paint ' em white and float around . Of course the roads , there is n't a hill in the state and never any frost . I 've been thinking about the Sun Belt . Go down there and thumb my nose at the heating-oil bills . Then they get you on the airconditioning . You ca n't escape . " Harry says , " Sodium wafers , that 's the answer . Electricity straight from sunlight . It 's about five years- off , that 's what Consumer Reports was saying . Then we can tell those Arabs to take their fucking oil and grease their camels with it . " Charlie says , " Traffic fatalities are up . You want to know why they 're up ? Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs now and back into alcohol . Two , everybody 's gone to compacts and they crumple like paper bags . " He chuckles and twirls the flavored toothpick against his lower lip as the two men gaze out the window at the river of dirty tin . An old low-slung station wagon pulls into the lot but it has no wooden rack on top ; though Harry 's heart skips , it is not his daughter . The station wagon noses around and heads out into 111 again , just casing . Burglaries are up . Harry asks Charlie , " Melanie really thought about "  --  he balks at " balling , " it is not his generation 's word  --  " going to bed with me ? " " That 's what the lady said . But you know these kids , they come right out with everything we used to keep to ourselves . Does n't mean there 's more of it . Probably less as a matter of fact . By the time they 're twenty-five they 're burnt out . " " I was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now this new girl of Nelson 's  --  " " I do n't want to hear about it , " Charlie says , pivoting to go back to his desk . " They 're about to get married , for Chrissake . " Running . Harry has continued the running he began up in the Poconos , as a way of getting his body back from those sodden years he never thought about it , just ate and did what he wanted , restaurant lunches downtown in Brewer plus the Rotary everyp225Thursday , it begins to pack on . The town is dark he runs through , full of slanty alleys and sidewalks cracked and tipped from underneath , whole cement slabs lifted up by roots like crypt lids in a horror movie , the dead reach up , they catch at his heels . He keeps moving , pacing himself , overriding the protestof his lungs and making of his stiff muscles and tired blood a kind of machine that goes where the brain directs , uphill past the wide-eaved almost Chinese-looking house where the butch women hammer , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television or else snuggle into whatever it is they do early or else saving electricity , women wo n't get paid the same as men until ERA passes , at least having a nest of them moving into the neighborhood not like blacks or Puerto Ricans , they do n't breed . Norway maples shade these streets . Not much taller than when he was a boy . Grab a low branch and hoist yourself up into a hornets ' nest . Split the seeds and stick them to your nose to make yourself a rhinoceros . Panting , he cuts through their shadow . A slim pain cuts through his high left side . Hold on , heart . Old Fred Springer popped off in a blaze of red , anyway Rabbit has always imagined the last thing you 'd see in a heart attack would be red , does n't think that 'll be for him somehow , a long slow wrestle with black cancer probably . Amazing , how dark these American houses are , at nine o'clock at night . A kind of ghost town , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coop , only a brownish bit of glow showing through a window crack here and there , night light in a child 's room . His mind strides on into a bottomless sorrow , thinking of children . Little Nellie in his room newly moved into Vista Crescent , his teddies stacked in a row beside him , his eyes like theirs unable to close , scared of dying while asleep , thinking of baby Becky who did fall through , who did die . A volume of water still stood in the tub many hours later , dust on the unstirring gray surface , just a little rubber stopper to lift and God in all His strength did nothing . Dry leaves scrape and break underfoot , the sound of fall , excitement in the air . The Pope is coming , and the wedding is Saturday . Janice asks him why is his heart so hardp226toward Nelson . Because Nelson has swallowed up the boy that was and substituted one more pushy man in the world , hairy wrists , big prick .

Once clowning on the way to school along the gutter that now is dry he slipped on the slime and fell in , got his knickers soaked , those corduroy knickers they used to make you wear , swish swish , and the long socks , incredible how far back he goes now , he can remember girls in first grade still wearing high-button shoes : Margaret Schoelkopf , she was so full of life her nose would start to bleed for no reason . When he fell in the gutter of ice-plant water his knickers were so wet he had to run home crying and change , he hated being late for school . Or for anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so much care where he went but he had to be home on time , and for most of his life this sensationp227would overtake him , anywhere , in the locker room , on a 16A bus , in the middle of a fuck , that he was late for somewhere and he was in terrible dark trouble , a kind of tunnel would open in his mind with Mom at the end of it with a switch . Do you want a switching Hassy ? she would ask him as if asking if he wanted dessert , the switches came off the base of the little pear tree in the narrow back yard on Jackson Road ; how the yellowjackets would hover over the fallen rotting fruit . Lately he no longer ever feels he is late for somewhere , a strange sort of peace at his time of life like a thrown ball at the top of its arc is for a second still . His gold is rising in value , ten dollars an ounce or so in the papers every day , ten times thirty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think how Pop slaved . Janice putting that monocle on was a surprise , the only trouble with her in bed is she still does n't like to blow , something mean about her mouth and always was , Melanie had those funny saucy stubborn cherry lips , a wonder Charlie did n't pop his aorta in some motel down there in the sands , how lovely it is when a woman forgets herself and opens her mouth to laugh or exclaim so wide you see the whole round cavern the ribbed pink roof and the tongue like a rug in a hall and the butterfly-shaped blackness in the back that goes down into the throat , Pru did that the other day in the kitchen at something Ma Springer said , her smile usually wider on one side than the other and a bit cautious like she might get burned , but all the girls coming up now blew , it was part of the culture , taken for granted , fuck-and-suck movies they call them , right out in the open , you take your date , ADULT FILMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where in Rabbit 's day they used to go see Ronald Reagan being co-pilot against the Japs .

One thing he does hate is seeing bits of food , rice or cereal or whatever , hanging in the little hairs of a face during a meal . Poor Mom in those last years.  |p228His  knees are jarring . His big gut jounces . Each night he tries to extend his run among the silent dark houses , through the cones of the streetlights , under the ice-cold lopsided moon , that the other night driving home in the Corona he happened to see through the tinted upper part of the windshield and for a second thought , My God , it is green . Tonight he pushes himself as far as Kegerise Street , a kind of alley that turns downhill again , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data Development and an old stone farmhouse that all the years he was growing up had boarded windows and a yard full of tumbledown weeds milkweed and thistle and a fence of broken slats but now was all fixed up with a little neat sign outside saying Albrecht Stamm Homestead and inside all sorts of authentic hand-made furniture and quaint kitchen equipment to show what a farmhouse was like around 1825 and in cases in the hall photographs of the early buildings of Mt . Judge before the turn of the century but not anything of the fields when the area of the town was in large part Stamm 's farm , they did n't have cameras that far back or if they did did n't point them at empty fields . Old man Springer had been on the board of the Mt . Judge Historical Society and helped raise the funds for the restoration , after he died Janice and Bessie thought Harry might be elected to take his place on the board but it did n't happen , his checkered past haunting him . Even though a young hippie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry the old Stamm place is full of ghosts , those old farmers lived weird lives , locking their crazy sisters in the attic and strangling the pregnant hired girl in a fit of demon rum and hiding the body in the potato bin so that fifty years later the skeleton comes to light . Next door the Sunshine Athletic Associationused to be , that Harry as a boy had thought was full of athletes , so he hoped he could some day belong , but when twenty years ago he did get inside it smelled of cigar butts and beer gone fiat in the bottom of the glass . Then through the Sixties it fell into dilapidation and disrepute , the guys who drank and played cards in there getting older and fewer and morep229morose . So when the building came up for sale the Historical Society bought it and tore it down and made where it was into a parking lot for the visitors who came by to the Stamm Homesteadon their way to Lancaster to look at the Amish or on their way to Philadelphia to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it tucked away on what used to be Kegerise Alley but an amazing number do , white-haired most of them . History . The more of it you have the more you have to live it . After a little while there gets to be too much of it to memorize and maybe that 's when empires start to decline . Now he is really rolling , the alley slants down past the body shop and a chicken house turned into a little leather-working plant , these ex-hippies are everywhere , trying to hang on , they missed the boat but had their fun , he has pushed through the first wave of fatigue , when you think you ca n't drag your body another stride , your thighs pure pain . Then second wind comes and you break free into a state where your body does it by itself , a machine being ridden , your brain like the astronaut in the tip of the rocket , your thoughts just flying . If only Nelson would get married and go away and come back rich twenty years from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own instead of crawling back ? Too crowded out there . The Pope , Jesus , you have to hope he is n't shot , just like America to have some nut take a shot to get his name in the papers , that Squeaky Fromme who used to lay the old cowboys for the Manson ranch , all the ass that Manson had you 'd think it would have made him nicer since it 's being sexually frustrated that causes war , he read somewhere . He knows how the Pope feels about contraception though , he could never stand rubbers , even when they gave them to you free in the Army , this month 's Consumer Reports has an article on them , page after page , all this testing , some people apparently prefer bright-colored ones with ribs and little nubbins to give the woman an added tickle inside , did the stafferson the magazine all ask the secretaries to screw or what , some people even liked ones made out of sheep intestine , the very thought of it makes him crawl down there , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to the end of the article , he was so turned off . He wonders about his daughter , what she uses , country methods they used to kid about in school , squat on a cornstalk , she looked pretty virginal in that one glimpse of her and who would n't be , surrounded by rubes ? Ruth would set her straight , what pigs men are . And that barking dog would be a discouragement too . There is a longer way home , down Jackson to Joseph and over , but tonight he takes the shortcut , diagonally across the lawn of the big stone Baptist church , he likes the turf under his feet for a minute , the church facade so dark , to the concrete steps that take you down onto Myrtle , and on past the red , white , and blue post office trucks parked in a row at the back platform , the American flag hanging limp and bright over the fake gable out front , used to he you should n't fly the flag at night but now all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soaking up the last dribble of energy flying the flag . Myrtle leads into Joseph from the other end . They will be sitting around waiting for him , watching the boot ) tube or going on about the wedding , getting silly about it now that it 's so close and Soupy has declared all systems go , they 've invited Charlie Stavros after all and Grace Stuhl and a hatch of other biddies and a few friends from the Flying Eagle and it turns out Pru or Teresa as they call her in the announcement they want to send out has an aunt and uncle in Binghamton , New York , who will come down even if the father is some sorehead who wants to strangle his daughter and put her in the potato bin . In he will come and Janice will make her usual crack about him killing himself with a heart attack , it 's true he does get very red in his white face , he can see in the mirror in the foyer , with his blue eyes , Santa Claus without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair gasping for a while to get his breath , but that 's part of the fun , giving her a scare , poor mutt what would she do without him , have to give up the Flying Eagle and everything , go back to selling nuts in Kroll 's . In he will come and there Pru will be sitting on the sofa right next to Nelson like thep231police officer who takes the criminal from one jail to another on t he train without letting the handcuffs show , the one thing Harry is fearful of now that Pru is in the family is stinking up the room with his sweat . Tothero had it that time in the Sunshine , an old man 's sour sad body smell , and getting out of bed in the morning sometimes Harry surprises it on himself , this faraway odor like a corpse just beginning to sweeten . Middle age is a wonderful country , all the things you thought would never happen are happening . When he was fifteen , forty-six would have seemed the end of the , rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life was to show up you 'd think it would have by now . . Yet at moments it seems it has , there are just no words for it , it is not something you dig for but sits on the top of the table like an unopened dewy beer can . Not only is the Pope coming but the Dalai Lama they bounced out of Tibet twenty years ago is going around the U.S.A. talking to divinity schools and appearingon TV talk shows , Harry has always been curious about what it would feel like to be the Dalai Lama . A ball at the top of its arc , a leaf on the skin of a pond . A water strider in a way is what the mind is like , those dimples at the end of their legs where they do n't break the skin of the water quite . When Harry was little God used to spread in the dark above his bed like that and then when the bed became strange and the girl in the next aisle grew armpit hair He entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now He had withdrawn , giving Harry the respect due from one well-off gentleman to another , but for a calling card left in the pit of the stomach , a bit of lead true as a plumb bob pulling Harry down toward all those leaden dead in the hollow earth below . The front lights of Ma Springer 's big shadowy stucco house blaze , they are all excited by the wedding , Pru now has a constantblush and Janice has n't played tennis for days and Bessie evidently gets up in the middle of the night and goes downstairs to watch on the bigger TV the old Hollywood comedies , men in big-brimmed hats and little mustaches , womenp232with shoulders broader than their hips swapping wisecracks in newspaper offices and deluxe hotel suites , Ma must have seen these movies first when she had all black hair and the Brewer downtown was a great white way . Harry jogs in place to let a car pass , one of those crazy Mazdas with the Wankel engine like a squirrel wheel , Manny says they 'll never get the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streetlight , notices Janice 's Maverick is n't parked out front , sprints down the brick walk and up the porch steps , and at last on the porch , under the number 89 , stops running . His momentum is such that the world for a second or two streams on , seeming to fling all its trees and housetops outward against star-spangled space . In bed Janice says , " Harry . " " What ? " After you run your muscles have a whole new pulled , sheathed feel and sleep comes easy . " I have a little confession to make . " " You 're screwing Stavros again . " " Do n't be so rude . No , did you notice the Maverick was n't left out front as usual ? " " I did . I thought , How nice . ' " " It was Nelson who put it out back , in the alley . We really ought to clean out that space in the garage some day , all these old bicycles nobody uses . Melanie 's Fuji is still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson . Hey , are you going to talk all night , or what ? I 'm beat . " " He put it there because he did n't want you to see the front fender . " " Oh no . That son of a bitch . That little son of a bitch . " " It was n't his fault exactly , this other man just kept coming , though I guess the Stop sign was on Nelson 's street . " " Oh Christ . " " Luckily both hit their brakes , so it really was just the smallest possible bump . "  | " The other guy hurt ? " " Well , he said something about whiplash , but then that 's what people are trained to say now , until they can talk to their lawyer . " " And the fender is mashed ? " " Well , it 's tipped in . The headlight does n't focus the same place the other does . But it 's fine in the daytime . It 's really hardly more than a scratch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked fenderbenderstrikes again . " " He really was terrified to tell you . He made me promise would n't , so you ca n't say anything to him . " " I ca n't ? Then why are you telling me ? How can I go to sleep now ? My head 's pounding . It 's like he has it in a vise . " " Because I did n't want you noticing by yourself and making a scene . Please , Harry . Just until after the wedding . He 's really very embarrassed about it . " " The fuck he is , he loves it . He has my head in a vise and he just keeps turning the screw . That he 'd do it to your car , after you 've been knocking yourself out for him , that 's really grati-tude . " " Harry , he 's about to get married , he 's in a state . " " Well , shit , now I 'm in a state . Where 're some clothes ? I got to go outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it ever get new batteries ? " " I 'm sorry I told you . Nelson was right . He said you would n't be able to handle it . " " Oh did he say that ? Our own Mr. Cool . " " So just settle down . I 'll take care of the insurance forms and everything . " " And who do you think pays for the increase in our insurance rates ? " " We do , " she says . " The two of us. "  |p234St  . John 's Episcopal Church in Mt . Judge is a small church that never had to enlarge , built in 1912 in the traditional lowsidedsteep-roofed style , of a dark gray stone hauled from the north of the county , whereas the Lutheran church was built of local red sandstone , and the Reformed , next to the fire station , of brick . Ivy has been encouraged around St. John 's pointed windows . Inside , it is dark , with knobby walnut pews and dados and , on the walls between stained-glass windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in memory of the dead gentry who contributed heavily here , in the days when it looked like Mt . Judge might become a fashionable suburb . WHITELAW . STOVER . LEGGETT . English names in a German county , gone to give tone to the realms of the departed after thirty years as wardens and vestrymen . Old man Springer had done his bit but the spaces between the windows were used up by then . Though the wedding is small and the bride an Ohio workingman'sdaughter , yet in the eyes of passersby the gathering would make a bright brave flurry before the church 's rust-red doors , on the verge of four o'clock this September the twenty-second . A person or persons driving past this Saturday afternoon on the way to the MinitMart or the hardware store would have a pang of wanting to be among the guests . The organist with his red robe over his arm is ducking into the side door . He has a goatee . A little grubby guy in green coveralls like a troll is waiting for Harry to show up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only decent to decorate the altar at least , Fred would have died to see Nellie married in St. John 's with a bare altar . Two bouquets of white mums and baby 's breath come to $38.50 , Rabbit pays him with two twenties , it was a bad sign when the banks started paying out in twenties instead of tens , and yet the two-dollar bill still is n't catching on . People are superstitious . This was n't supposed to be a wedding at all but in fact it 's costingplenty . They 've had to take three rooms over at the Four Seasons Motel on Route 422 : one for the mother of the bride ,  |p235Mrs  . Lubell , a small scared soul who looks like she thinks they 'll all stick forks into her if she drops her little smile for a second ; and another for Melanie , who came across the Commonwealth with Mrs. Lubell from Akron in a bus , and for Pru , who has been displaced from her room  --  Melanie 's old room and before that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mim , whom Bessie and Janice did n't want in the house at all but l tarry insisted , she 's his only sister and the only aunt Nelson has got ; and the third room for this couple from Binghamton , Pru 's aunt and uncle , who were driving down today but had n't checked in by three-thirty , when the shuttle service Harry has been running in the Corona picked up the two girls and the mother to bring them to the church . His head is pounding . This mother bothers him , her smile has been on her face so long it 's as dry as a pressed flower , she does n't seem to belong to his generation at all , she 's like an old newspaper somebody has used as a drawer liner and then in cleaning house you lift out and try to read ; Pru 's looks must have all come from the father 's side . At the motel the woman kept worrying that the messages they were leaving at the front desk for her tardy brother and sisterin-lawwere n't clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got damp and ruined . A case of Mumm 's second-best champagne waits back in the Joseph Street kitchen for the little get-together afterwards that nobody would call a reception ; Janice and her mother decided they should have the sandwiches catered by a grandson of Grace Stuhl 's who would bring along this girlfriend in a serving uniform . And then they ordered a cake from some wop over on Eleventh Street who was charging one hundred and eighty-five American dollars for a cake , a cake  --  Harry could n't believe it . Every time Nelson turns around , it costs his father a bundle . Harry stands for a minute in the tall ribbed space of the empty church , reading the plaques , hearing Soupy 's giggle greet the three dolled-up women off in a side room , one of those outof-sightchambers churches have where the choir puts itself intop236robes and the deacons count the collection plates and the communionwine is stored where the acolytes wo n't drink it and the whole strange show is made ready . Billy Fosnacht was supposed to be best man but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Laid-Back called Slim is standing around with a carnation in his lapel waiting to usher . Uncomfortable from the way this young man 's slanted eyes brush across him , Rabbit goes outside to stand by the church doors , whose rust-red paint in the Septembersun gives back heat so as to remind him of standing in his fresh tan uniform on a winter day in Texas at the side of the barracks away from the wind , that incessant wind that used to pour from that great thin sky across the treeless land like the whine of homesickness through this soldier who had never before been away from Pennsylvania . Standing there thus for a breath of air , in this pocket of peace , he is trapped in the position of a greeter , as the guests suddenly begin to arrive . Ma Springer 's stately dark-blue Chrysler pulls up , grinding its tires on the curb , and the three old ladies within claw at the door handles for release . Grace Stuhl has a translucent wart off-center on her chin but she has n't forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the only one here went to your wedding too , " she tells Harry on the church porch . " Not sure I was there myself , " he says . " How did I act ? " " Very dignified . Such a tall husband for Janice , we all said . " " And he 's kept his looks , " adds Amy Gehringer , the squattest of these three biddies . Her face is enlivened with rouge and a flaking substance the color of Russian salad dressing . She pokes him in the stomach , hard . " Even added to them some , " the old lady wisecracks . " I 'm trying to take it off , " he says , as if he owes her something . " I go jogging most every night . Do n't I , Bessie ? " " Oh it frightens me , " Bessie says . " After what happened to Fred . And you know there was n't an ounce extra on him . " " Take it easy , Harry , " Webb Murkett says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can injure the walls of your intestines , jogging . The blood all rushes to the lungs . "  | " Hey Webb , " Harry says , flustered . " You know my mother-in-law . " " My pleasure , " he says , introducing himself and Cindy all around . She is wearing a black silk dress that makes her look like a young widow . Would that she were , Jesus . Her hair has been fluffed up by a blow-dryer so it does n't have that little-headed wet-otter look that he loves . The top of her dress is held together with a pin shaped like a bumblebee at the lowest point of a plunging V-shaped scoop . And Bessie 's friends are staring at gallant Webb with such enchantment Harry reminds them , " Go right in , there 's a guy there leading people to their seats . " " I want to go right up front , " Amy Gehringer says , " so I can get a good look at this young minister Bessie raves so about . " " ' Fraid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb . " Oh , " Cindy says , " Webb got his eighteen in already , he was over there by eight-thirty . " " Who 'd you get to take my place ? " Harry asks , jealous , and unable to trust his eyes to rest on Cindy 's tan decolletage . The tops of tits are almost the best part , nipples can be frightening . Just above the bumblebee a white spot even her bikini bra hides from the sun shows . The little cross is up higher , just under the sexy hollow between her collarbones . What a package . " The young assistant pro went around with us , " Webb confides . " A seventy-three , Harry . A seventy-three , with a ball into the pond on the fifteenth , he hits it so far . " Harry is hurt but he has to greet the Fosnachts , who are pushing behind . Janice did n't want to invite them , especially after they decided not to invite the Harrisons , to keep it all small . But since Nelson wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also even though Peggy has let herself slide there is that aura about a woman who 's once upon a time taken off all her clothes for you however poorly it 's turned out . What the hell , it 's a wedding , so he bends down and kisses Peggy to one side of the big wet hungry mouth he remembers.  |p238She  is startled , her face broader than he remembers . Her eyes swim up at him in the wake of the kiss , but since one of them is a walleye he never knows which to search for expression. 011ie 's handshake is limp , sinewy , and mean : a mean-spirited little loser , with ears that stick out and hair like dirty straw . Harry crunches his knuckles together a little , squeezing . " How 's the music racket , 011ie ? Still tootling ? " 011ie is one of these reedy types , common around Brewer , who can pick out a tune on anything but never manage to make it anywhere big . He works in a music store , Chords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weiser Street near the old Baghdad , where the adult movies show now . Peggy , her voice defensive from the kiss , says , " He sits in on synthesizer sometimes with a group of Billy 's friends . " " Keep at it , 011ie , you 'll be the Elton John of the Eighties . Seriously , how 've you both been ? Jan and I keep saying , we got to have you two over . " Over Janice 's dead body . Funny , just that one innocent forlorn screw , and Janice holds a grudge , where he 's forgiving as hell of Charlie , just about the only friend he has left in fact . And here is Charlie . " Welcome to the merger , " Harry kids . Charlie chuckles , his shrug small and brief . He knows the tide is running against him , with this marriage . Still , he has some reserve within him , some squared-off piece of philosophy that keeps him from panicking . " You seen the bridesmaid ? " Harry asks him . Melanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em went over into Brewer last night and got drunk as skunks , to judge from Nelson . How 's that for a way to act on the night before your wedding ? " Charlie 's head ticks slowly sideways in obliging disbelief . This elderly gesture is jarred , however , when Mim , dressed in some crinkly pants outfit in chartreuse , with ruffles , grabs him from behind around the chest and wo n't let go . Charlie 's face tenses in fright , and to keep him from guessing who it is Mim presses her face against his back so that Harry fears all her make-up willp239rub off on Charlie 's checks . Mim comes on now any hour of the day or night made up like a showgirl , every tint and curl exactly the way she wants it ; but really all the creams and paints in a world of jars wo n't counterfeit a flexible skin , and rimming your eyes in charcoal may be O.K. for these apple-green babies that go to the disco but over forty it makes a woman look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth are bared as she hangs on , wrestling Charlie from behind like an eleven-year-old with Band-Aids on her knees . " Jesus , " Charlie grunts , seeing the hands at his chest with their purple nails long as grasshoppers , but slow to think back through all the women he has known who this might be . Embarrassed for her , worried for him , Harry begs , " C'm on , Mim . " She wo n't let go , her long-nosed tarted-up face mussed and distorted as she maintains the pressure of her grip . " Gotcha , " she says . " The Greek heartbreaker . Wanted for transporting a minor across state lines and for misrepresenting used cars . Put the handcuffs on him , Harry . " Instead Harry puts his hands on her wrists , encountering bracelets he does n't want to bend , thousands of dollars ' worth of gold on her bones , and pulls them apart , having set his own body into the jostle for leverage , while Charlie , looking grimmer every second , holds himself upright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was . Pried loose at last , she touches herself rapidly here and there , putting each hair and ruffle back into place . " Thought the boogyboo had gotten you , did n't you Charlie ? " she jeers . " Pre-owned , " Charlie tells her , pulling his coat sleeves taut to restore his dignity . " Nobody calls them used cars anymore . " " Out west we call them shitboxes . " " Shh , " Harry urges . " They can hear you inside . They 're about to get started . " Still exhilarated by her tussle with Charlie , and amused by the disapproving conscientious man her brotherhas become , Mim wraps her arms around Harry 's neck andp240hugs him hard . The frills and pleats of her fancy outfit crackle , crushing against his chest . " Once a bratty sister , " she says breathily in his ear , " always a bratty sister . " Charlie has slipped into the church . Mim 's eyelids , shut , shine in the sunlight like smears left by some collision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark swerves of rubber , the gouges of crippled metal left to mark where somethingunthinkable had suddenly happened to someone . Though it happened the day 's traffic continues . Hold me , Harry , she used to cry out , little Mim in her hood between his knees as their sled hit the cinders spread at the bottom of Jackson Road , and orange sparks flew . Years before , a child had died under a milk truck sledding here and all the children were aware of this : that child 's blank face leaned toward them out of each snowstorm . Now Harry sees a glisten in Mim 's eyelids as in the backs of the Japanese beetles that used to cluster on the large dull leaves of the Bolgers ' grape arbor out back . Also he secs how her earlobeshave been elongated under the pull of jewelry and how her ruffles shudder as she pants , out of breath after her foolery . She is sinking through all her sins and late nights toward being a pathetic hag , he secs , one of those women you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Mom 's strong bones in her face to save her . He hesitates , before going in . The town falls away from this church like a wide flight of stairs shuffled together of roofs and walls , a kind of wreck wherein many Americans have died . He hears the side door where the organist hurried in open , and peeks around the corner , thinking it might be Janice needing him . But it is Nelson who steps out , Nelson in his cream-colored three-piece marrying suit with pinched waist and wide lapels , that looks too big for him , perhaps because the flared pants almost cover the heels of his shoes . As always when he sees his son unexpectedly Harry feels shame . His upper lip lifts to call out in recognition , but the boy does n't look his way , just appears to sniff the air , looking around at the grass and down toward the houses of Mt . Judge and thenp241up the other way at the sky at the edge of the mountain . Run , I larry wants to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mim 's perfume at the intake of breath . Softly the child closes the door again behind him , ignorant that he has been seen . Behind the ajar rust-red portal the church is gathering in silence toward its eternal deed . The world then will be cloven between those few gathered in a Sunday atmosphere and all the sprawling fortunate Saturday remainder , the weekday world going on about its work . From childhood on Rabbit has resented ceremonies . He touches Mim on the arm to take her in , and over the spun glass of her hairdo sees a low-slung dirty old Ford station wagon with the chrome roof rack heightened by rough green boards crawl by on the street . He is n't quick enough to see the passengers , only gets a glimpse of a fat angry face staring from a back window . A fat mannish face yet a woman 's . " What 's the matter ? " Mim asks . " I do n't know . Nothing . " " You look like you 've seen a ghost . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all this ? " " Me . Aunt Mim ? It seems all right . The chick will take charge . " " That 's good ? " " For a while . You must let go , Harry . The boy 's life is his , you live your own . " " That 's what I 've been telling myself . But it feels like a copout . " They go in . A pathetic little collection of heads juts up far down front . This mysterious slant-eyed Slim , smoothly as if they were paying him , escorts Mim down the aisle to the second pew and indicates with a graceful sly gesture where Harry should settle in the first , next to Janice . The space has been waiting . On Janice 's other side sits the other mother . Mrs. Lubell 's profile is pale ; like her daughter she is a redhead but her hair has been rinsed to colorless little curls , and she never could have had Pru 's height and nice rangy bearing . She looks , Harry ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overp242to him her desiccated but oddly perfect smile , a smile such as flickered from the old black-and-white movie screens , coy and certain , a smile like a thread of pure melody , that when she was young must have seemed likely to lift her life far above where it settled . Janice has pulled back her head to whisper with her mother in the booth behind . Mim has wound up in the same pew as Ma Springer and her biddies . Stavros sits with the Murkettsin the third pew , he has Cindy 's neckline to look down when he gets bored , let him see what country-club tits look like after all those stuffed grape leaves . In willful awkwardness the Fosnachts were seated or seated themselves across the aisle , on what would have been the bride 's side if there had been enough to make a side , and are quarrelling in whispers between themselves : much hissed emphasis from Peggy and stoic forwardgazingmutter from 011ie . The organist is doodling through the ups and downs of some fugue to give everybody a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ruddy goatee dips about an inch above the keyboard during the quiet parts . The way he slaps and tugs at the stops reminds Harry of the old Linotype he used to operate , the space adjuster and the way the lead jumped out hot , all done with computer tapes now . To the left of the altar one of the big wall panels with rounded tops opens , it is a secret door like in a horror movie , and out of it steps Archie Campbell in a black cassock and white surplice and stole . He flashes his What ? Me worry ? grin , those sudden seedy teeth . Nelson follows him out , head down , looking at nobody . Slim slides up the aisle , light as a cat , to stand beside him . He must be a burglar in his spare time . He stands a good six inches taller than Nelson . Both have these short punk haircuts . Nelson 's hair makes a whorl in back that Harry knows so well his throat goes dry , something caught in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ has been silent this while . With both plump hands lifted , Soupy bids them all stand . To the music of their rustle Melanie leads in Pru , from another side room , along the altar rail . The secret knowledgep243shared by all that she is pregnant enriches her beauty . She wears an ankle-length crepey dress that Ma Springer calls oatmeal in color and Janice and Melanie call champagne , with a brown sash they decided to leave off her waist lest they have to tie it too high . It must have been Melanie who wove the little wreath of field flowers , already touched by wilt , that the bride wears as a crown . There is no train or veil save an invisible organic pride . I'ru 's face , downcast and purse-lipped , is flushed , her carroty hair brushed slick down her back and tucked behind her ears to reveal their crimped soft shell shapes hung with tiny hoops of gold , her eyes imparting green as she glances toward Nelson and then the minister . Harry could halt her with his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Melanie gives all the old folks a merry eye ; Pru 's long red-knuckled fingers communicate a tremble to her little bouquet of baby 's breath . Now her bearing as she faces the minister is grave with that gorgeous slowed composureof women carrying more than themselves . Soupy calls them Dearly Beloved . The voice welling up out of this little man is terrific , Harry had noticed it at the house , but here , in the nearly empty church , echoing off the walnut knobs and memorial plaques and high arched rafters , beneath the tall central window of Jesus taking off into the sky with a pack of pastel apostles for a launching pad , the timbre is doubled , richer , with a rounded sorrowful something Rabbit had n't noticed hitherto , gathering and pressing the straggle of guests into a congregation , subduing any fear that this ceremony might be a farce . Laugh at ministers all you want , they have the words we need to hear , the ones the dead have spoken . The union of husband and wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended by God for their mutual joy . Soupy bats his eyelids between phrases , is his only flaw . Harry hears a faint groan behind him : Ma Springer standing on her legs too long . Mrs. Lubell over past Janice has removed a grubby-looking handkerchief from her purse and dabs at her face with it . Janice is smiling . There is ap244dark dent at the corner of her lips . With a little white hat on her head like a flower she looks Polynesian . Ringingly Soupy addresses the rafters : " If any of you can show just cause why they may not lawfully be married , speak now ; or else for ever hold your peace . " Peace . A pew creaks . The couple from Binghamton . Dead Fred Springer . Ruth . Rabbit fights down a crazy impulse to shout out . His throat feels raw . The minister now speaks to the couple direct . Nelson , from hanging lamely over on the side , his eyes murky in their sockets and the carnation crooked in his lapel , moves closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The back of his neck looks so thin and bare above his collar . That whorl . Pru has been asked a question . In an exceedingly small voice she says she will . Now Nelson is being questioned and his father 's itch to shout out , to play the disruptive clown , has become something else , a prickling at the bridge of his nose , a pressure in the two small ducts there . Woman , wife , covenant , love her , comfort her , honor and keep her , sickness , health , forsaking all others as long as you both shall live ? Nelson in a voice midway in size between Soupy 's and Pru 's says he will . And the burning in his tear ducts and the rawness scraping at the back of his throat have become irresistible , all the forsaken poor ailing paltry witnesses to this marriage at Harry 's back roll forward in hoops of terrible knowing , an impalpable suddenly sensed mass of human sadness concentrated burningly upon the nape of Nelson 's neck as he and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fumble in their thick red new prayer books after the name and number of a psalm announced ; Soupy booms angelically above their scattered responses , wife , a fruitful vine , to which Rabbit can not contribute , the man who fears the Lord , because he is weeping , weeping , washing out the words ,  |p245the  page , which has become as white and blank as the nape of Nelson 's poor mute frail neck . Janice looks up at him in jaunty surprise under her white hat and Mrs. Lubell with that wistful cleaning-lady smile passes over her grubby handkerchief . He shakes his head No , he is too big , he will overwhelm the cloth with his effluvia ; then takes it anyway , and tries to blot this disruptive tide . There is this place the tears have unlocked that is endlessly rich , a spring . " May you live to see your children 's children , " Soupy intones in his huge mellow encompassing fairy 's voice . " May peace be upon Israel , " he adds . And outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vows taken in the shaky young voices under the towering Easter-colored window of Christ 's space shot and the Lord 's Prayer mumbled through and the pale couple turned from the requisite kiss ( poor Nellie , could n't he be just another inch taller ? ) to face as now legally and mystically one the little throng of their blood , their tribe , outside in the sickly afternoon , clouds having come with the breeze that flows toward evening , the ridiculous tears dried in long stains on Harry 's face , then Mim comes into his arms again , a sisterly embrace , all sorts of family grief since the days he held her little hand implied , the future has come upon them darkly , his sole seed married , marriage that daily doom which she may never know ; lean and crinkly in his arms she is getting to be a spinster , even a hooker can be a spinster , think of all she 's had to swallow all these years , his baby sister , crying in imitation of his own tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the after-church smiles of the others flicker about them like butterflies born to live a day . Oh this day , this holiday they have made just for themselves from a mundane Saturday , this last day of summer . What a great waste of gas it seems as they drive in procession to Ma Springer 's house through the slanted streets of the town . Harry and Janice in the Corona follow Bessie 's blue Chrysler in case the old dame plows into something , with Mim bringing Mrs. Lubell in Janice'sp246Maverick , its headlight still twisted , behind . " What made you cry so much ? " Janice asks him . She has taken off her hat and fiddled her bangs even in the rearview mirror . " I do n't know . Everything . The way Nellie looked from the back . The way the backs of kids ' heads trust you . I mean they really liked that , this little dumb crowd of us gathered to watch . " He looks sideways at her silence . The tip of her little tongue rests on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She says , " If you 're so full of tears you might try being less mean about him and the lot . " " I 'm not mean about him and the lot . He does n't give a fuck about the lot , he just wants to hang around having you and your mother support him and the easiest way to put a face on that is to go through some sort of motions over at the lot . You know how much that caper of his with the convertibles cost the firm ? Guess . " " He says you got him so frustrated he went crazy . He says you knew you were doing it , too . " " Forty-five hundred bucks , that was what those shitboxes cost . Plus now all the parts Manny 's had to order and the garage time to fix ' em , you can add another grand . " " Nelson said the TR sold right off . " " That was a fluke . They do n't make TRs anymore . " " He says Toyotas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are outselling them all over the East . " " See , that 's why Charlie and me do n't want the kid over at the lot . He 's full of negative thinking . " " Has Charlie said he does n't want Nelson over at the lot ? " " Not in so many words . He 's too much of a nice guy . " " I never noticed he was such a nice guy . Nice in that way . I 'll ask him over at the house . " " Now do n't go lighting into poor Charlie , just because he 's moved on to Melanie . I do n't know what he 's ever said about Nelson . " " Moved on ! Harry , it 's been ten years . You must stop living in the past . If Charlie wants to make a fool of himself chasingp247after some twenty-year-old it could n't matter to me less . Once you 've achieved closure with somebody , all you have is good feelings for them . " " What 's this achieving closure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's a phrase people use . " " Those hussies you hang out with over at the club . Doris Kaufmann . Fuck her . " It stung him , that she thinks he lives in the past . Why should he be the one to cry at the wedding ? Mr. Nice Guy . Mr. Tame Guy . To Hell with them . " Well at least Charlie 's avoiding marriage so that makes him less of a fool than Nelson , " he says , and switches on the radio to shut off their conversation . The four-thirty news : earthquake in Hawaii , kidnappingof two American businessmen in El Salvador , Soviet tanks patrolling the streets of Kabul in the wake of last Sunday 's mysterious change of leadership in Afghanistan . In Mexico , a natural-gas pact with the United States signals possible longtermrelief for the energy crisis . In California , ten days of brush fire have destroyed more acres than any such fire since 1970 . In Philadelphia , publishing magnate Walter Annenberg has donated fifty thousand dollars to the Catholic Archdiocese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope John Paul the Second is scheduled to celebrate Mass on October the third . Annenberg , the announcer gravely concludes , is a Jew . " Why did they tell us that ? " Janice asks . God , she is dumb still . The realization comforts him . He tells her , " To make us alleged Christians feel lousy we 've all been such cheapskates about the Pope 's platform . " " I must say , " Janice says , " it does seem extravagant , to build such a thing you 're only going to use once . " " That 's life , " Harry says , pulling up to the curb along Joseph Street . There are so many cars in front of number 89 he has to park halfway up the block , in front of the house where the butch ladies live . One of them , a hefty youngish woman wearing an Army surplus fatigue jacket , is lugging a big pink roll of foilbackedinsulation up onto the front porch.  | " My son got married today , " Harry calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinks and then calls back , " Good luck to her . " " Him . " " I meant the bride . " " O.K. , I 'll tell her . " The expression on the woman 's face , slit-eyed like a cigar-store Indian , softens a little ; she sees Janice getting out of the car on the other side , and calls to her , in a shouting mood now , " Jan , how do you feel about it ? " Janice is so slow to answer Harry answers for her , " She feels great . Why would n't she ? " What he ca n't figure out about these butch ladies is not why they do n't like him but why he wants them to , why just the distant sound of their hammering has the power to hurt him , to make him feel excluded . Somehow , this Slim person , driving a canary-yellow Le Car with its name printed a foot high on the side , has made it from the church with bride , groom , and Melanie ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their cinnamon-brown ' 73 Dodge Dart with a Fiberglas-patched fender ; and even Soupy has beat their time , because his snappy little black Opel Manta with vanity plate ST JOHN is also parked by the curb this side of the maple that Ma Springer has been seeing from her front bedroom for over thirty years . These guests already crowd the living room , while this flustered little fat girl in a stab at a waitress uniform tries to carry around those hors d'oeuvres that are costing a fortune , muddled things that look like cheese melted on Taco Chips with a sprig of parsley added ; Harry dodges through , elbows lifted out of old basketball habit in case somebody tries to put a move on him , to get the champagne in the kitchen . Bottles of Mumm 's at twelve dollars apiece even at case price fill the whole second shelf of the fridge , stacked 69-style , foil heads by heavy hollow butts , beautiful . CHAMPAGNE PROVIDED AT SHOTGUN WEDDING , he thinks . Angstrom Foots Bill . Grace Stuhl 's grandson turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than two hundred fifty , with a bushy pirate 's beard , and he has teeny weenies frying in a pan on the stove and somethingwrapped in bacon in the oven . Also a beer he took from the fridge open on the counter . The noise in the living room keeps growing , and the front door keeps opening , Stavros and the Murketts following Mim and Ma 's brood in , and all the fools come gabbling when the first cork pops . Boy , it 's like coining , it ca n't stop , the plastic hollow-stemmed champagne glasses Janice found at the Acme are on the round Chinese tray on the counter behind Grace Stuhl 's grandson 's beer , too far away for Harry to reach without some of the tawny foam spillingonto the linoleum . The glasses as he fills them remind him of the gold coins , precious down through the ages , and a latch inside him lifts to let his sorrow out . What the hell , we 're all going down the chute together . Back in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nervous little toast she 's worked up , ending with the Pennsylvania Dutch , " 1 ) ir seid nur eins : halt es selle weg . " " What does that mean , Mom-mom ? " Nelson asks , afraid something'sbeing put over on him , such a child beside the blushing full-grown woman he 's crazily gone and married . " I was going to say , " Bessie says irritably . " You are now one : keep it that way . " Everybody cheers , and drinks , if they have n't already . Grace Stuhl glides a step forward , into the circle of space cleared by the breakfront , maybe she was a great dancer fifty years ago , a certain type of old lady keeps her ankles and her feet small , and she is one . " Or as they always used to say , " she proposes , " Bussie waiirt ows , kocha dut net . Kissing wears out , cooking do n't . " The cheers are louder . Harry pops another bottle and settles on getting drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get them to your mouth before they break in your fingers , and the little fat girlfriend has an amazing bosom . All this ass , at least there 's no shortage of that , it just keeps arriving . It seems an age since he lay awake disturbed by the entrance intop250this house of Pru Lubell , now Teresa Angstrom . Harry finds himself standing next to her mother . He asks her , " Have you ever been to this part of the world before ? " " Just passing through from time to time , " she says , in a wisp of a voice he has to bend over to hear , as at a deathbed . How softly Pru had spoken her vows at the ceremony ! " My people are from Chicago , originally . " " Well , your daughter does you proud , " he tells her . " We love her already . " He sounds to himself , saying this , like an impersonator ; life , just as we first thought , is playing grownup . " Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " But it 's never been easy for her . " " It has n't ? " " She takes after her father 's people . You know , always going to extremes . " " Really ? " " Oh yes . Stubborn . You dare n't go against them . " Her eves widen . He feels with this woman as if he and she have been set to making a paper chain together , with inadequate glue , and the links keep coming unstuck . It is not easy to hear in this room . Soupy and that Slim are giggling now together . " I 'm sorry your husband ca n't be here , " Harry says . " You would n't be if you knew him , " Mrs. Lubell replies serenely , and waggles her plastic glass as if to indicate how empty it is . " Lemme get you some more . " Rabbit realizes with a shock that she is his proper date : old as she seems this woman is about his age and instead of naked in dreamland with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's girlfriend he should be in mental bed with the likes of Mrs. Lubell . He retreatsinto the kitchen to look after the champagne supply and finds Nelson and Melanie busy at the bottles . The countertop is strewn with those little wire cages each cork comes trapped in . " Dad , there may not be enough , " Nelson whines . These two . " Why do n't you kids switch to milk ? " he suggests , taking a bottle from the boy . Heavy and green and cold ,  |p251Tike  money . The label engraved . His own poor dead dad never drank such bubbly in his life . Seventy years of beer and rusty water . To Melanie he says , " That expensive bike of yours is still in the garage . " " Oh I know , " she says , innocently staring . " If I took it back to Kent someone would steal it . " Her bulging brown eyes show no awareness that he has been curt , feeling betrayed by her. 1 le tells her , " You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , we 've said hello . " Did she leave the motel room he was paying for to go shack up with Charlie ? Harry ca n't follow it all . As if to make things right Melanie says , " I 'll tell Pru she can use the bike if she wants . It 's wonderful exercise for those muscles . " What muscles ? Back in the living room , nobody has been kind enough to take his place beside the mother of the bride . As he refills her readily proffered glass he says to her , " Thanks for the handkerchief . Back in the church . " " It must be hard , " she says , looking up at him more cozily now , " when there 's only one . " There 's not only one , he wants to tell her , drunker than he thought . There 's a dead little sister lying buried in the hill above its , and a long-legged girl roaming the farmland south of Galilee . Who does she remind him of , Mrs. Lubell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thelma Harrison , beside the pool . The Harrisons maybe should have been invited , but then you get into things like Buddy Inglefinger 's feelings being hurt . And Ronnie would have been gross . The organist with the goatee ( who invited him ? ) has joined Soupy and Slim now and something in the gaiety there leads the minister to remember his duty to others . He comes and joins Harry and the mother , a Christian act . " Well , " Harry blurts to him . " What 's done is done , huh ? " Becky a skeleton by now , strange to think . The nightie they buried her in turned to cobwebs . Her little toenails and fingernailsbits of confetti scattered on the satin . Reverend Campbell 's many small tobacco-darkened teeth dis/play themselves in a complacent smile . " The bride looked lovely , " he tells Mrs. Lubell . " She gets her height from her father 's people , " she says . " And her straight hair . Mine just curls naturally , where Frank 's sticks up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down . Teresa 's is n't quite that stubborn , since she 's a girl . " " Just lovely , " Soupy says , his smile getting a glaze . Harry asks the man , " How does that Opel of yours do for mileage ? " He takes out his pipe to address the question . " Up and down on these hills is n't exactly optimum , is it ? I 'd say twenty-five , twenty-six at best . I do a lot of stopping and starting and with nothing but short trips the carbon builds up . " Harry tells him , " You know the Japanese make these cars even though Buick sells ' em . I heard they may not be importing any after the 1980 model . That 's going to put a squeeze on parts . " Soupy is amused , his twinkling eyes tell Mrs. Lubell . TowardHarry he slides these eyes with mock severity and asks , " Are you trying to sell me a Toyota ? " Mom getting to be a skeleton too , come to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones . " Well , " Harry says , " we have a new little front-wheel drive called the Tercel , do n't know where they get these names from but never mind , it gets over forty m.p.g. on the highway and is plenty of car for a single man . " Waiting for the Resurrection . Suppose it never comes ? " But suppose I get married , " the small man protests , " and have an enormous brood . " " And indeed you should , " Mrs. Lubell unexpectedly pipes up . " The priests are leaving the church in droves because they 've got the itch . All this sex , in the movies , books , everywhere , even on the television if you stay up late enough , no wonder they ca n't resist . Be grateful you do n't have that conflict . " " I have often thought , " Soupy tells her in a muted return ofp253his great marrying voice , " I might have made an excellent priest . I adore structure . " Rabbit says , " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia gave the Catholics fifty thousand so they could put up this platform for the Pope without all this squawkingfrom the civil liberties people . " Soupy sniffs . " Do you know how much publicity that fifty thousand is going to get him ? It 's a bargain . " Slim and the organist seem to be discussing clothes , fingering each other 's shirts . If he has to talk to the organist Harry can ask why he did n't play " Here Comes the Bride . " Mrs. Lubell says , " They wanted the Pope to come to Clevelandbut I guess he had to draw the line somewhere . " " I hear he 's going to some farm way out in nowhere , " Harry says . Soupy touches the mother of the bride on the wrist and tips his head so as to show to Harry the beginnings of his bald spot . " Mr. Annenberg is our former ambassador to the Court of St. James in England . The story goes that when presenting his credentials to the Queen she held out her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , How 're ya doin ' , Queen ? ' " His growl is good . Mrs. Lubell laughs outright , a titter jumps from her to her shame , for she quickly covers her mouth with her knuckles . Soupy loves it , giving her back a deep laugh as from a barrel-chested old fart . If that 's the way they 're going to carry on Rabbit figures he can leave them to it , and using Soupy as a pick makes his move away . He scouts over the gathered heads looking for an opening . It 's always slightly dark in the living room , no matter how many lights are on or what the time of day , the trees and the porch cut down the sun . He 'd like a house some day with lots of light , splashing in across smart square surfaces . Why bury yourself alive ? Ma Springer has Charlie locked in a one-on-one over by the breakfront , her face puffy and purplish like a grape with the force of the unheard words she is urging into his ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ram 's but now whittled to an old goat 's , nodding almost greedily , like a chicken pecking up grains of corn . Up front , silhouetted against the picture window , the Murketts are holding forth with the Fosnachts , old 011ie no doubt letting these new folks know what a clever musical fellow he is and Peggy gushing , backing him up , holding within herself the knowledge of what a shiftless rat he amounts to domestically . The Murketts belong to the new circle in Harry 's life and the Fosnachts to the old and he hates to see them overlap ; even if Peggy was a pretty good lay that time he does n't want those dismal old high-school tagalongs creeping into his country-club set , yet he can see flattery is doing it , flattery and champagne , 011ie ogling Cindy ( do n't you wish ) and Peggy making cow-eyed moos all over Murkett , she 'll flop for anybody , 011ie must be very unsatisfying , one of those very thin reedy pricks probably . Harry wonders if he 'd better not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall of razzing he feels too delicate to push through , after all those tears in church , and remembering Becky and Pop and Mom and even old Fred who are n't here . Mim is on the sofa with Grace Stuhl and that other old biddy Amy , and Christ if they are n't having a quiet little ball , the two of them recalling Mim as a child to herself , the Diamond County accent and manner of expressing things making her laugh every minute , and she reminding them , all painted and done up in flowerpot foil , of the floozies they sit and watch all day and night on television , the old souls do n't even know they are floozies , these celebrity women playing Beat the Clock or Hollywood Squares or giving Mery or Mike or Phil the wink sitting in those talk show soft chairs with their knees sticking up naked , they all got there on their backs , nobody cares anymore , the times have caught up with Mim and put her on the gray sofa with the church folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandson are still in the kitchen and the girlfriend , after going around with the teeny weenies under her tits in a tricky little warmer with a ketchupdip , seems to have given up and joined them ; they have inp255there the little portable Sony Janice sometimes watches the Carol Burnett reruns on as she makes supper , and from the sound of it  --  cheers , band music  --  these useless drunken kids have turned on the Penn State  --  Nebraska game . Meanwhile there 's Pru in her champagne-colored wedding dress , the littlereath off her head now , standing alone over by the three-way lamp examining that heavy green glass bauble of Ma Springer 's , with the teardrop of air sealed inside , turning it over and over under the wan light with her long pink hands , where a wedding ring now gleams . Laughter explodes from the Fosnacht-Murkett group , which Janice has joined . Webb pushes past Harry toward the kitchen , his fingers full of plastic glasses . " How about that crazy Rose ? " he says , going by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .600 lately and only needs four more hits to be the first player ever to get two hundred hits in ten major league seasons . But it does n't mean that much , the Phillies are twelve and a half games out . " What a showboat , " Rabbit says , what they used to say about him , nearly thirty years ago . Perhaps in her conspicuous pregnancy Pru is shy of pushing through the crowd to join the others of her generation in the kitchen . Harry goes to her side and stoops down to kiss her demurewarm cheek before she is aware ; champagne makes it easy . " Are n't you supposed to kiss the bride ? " he asks her . She turns her head and gives him that smile that hesitates and then suddenly spreads , one corner tucked awry . Her eves have taken green from contemplating the glass , that strange glossy egg Harry has more than once thought would be good to pound into Janice 's skull . " Of course , " she says . Held against her belly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . He senses that she had been aware of his approaching in the side of her vision but had held still like a deer in danger . Among these strange people , her fate sealed by a ceremony , of course she is afraid . Rabbit tries to comfort his daughter-in-law : " I bet you 're beat . Do n't you get sleepy as hell ? As I remember it Janice did . "  | " You feel clumsy , " Pru allows , and with both hands replaces the green glass orb on the round table that is like a wooden leaf all around the stem of the standing lamp . Abruptly she asks , " Do you think I 'll make Nelson happy ? " " Oh sure . The kid and I had a good long talk about it once . He thinks the world of you . " " He does n't feel trapped ? " " Well , frankly , that 's what I was curious about , ' cause in his position I might . But honest to God , Teresa , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up he 's always had this sense of fairness and in this case he seems to feel fair is fair . Listen . Do n't you worry yourself . The only thing bothering Nelson these days is his old man . " " He thinks the world of you , " she says , her voice very small , in case this echo is too impudent . Harry snorts ; he loves it when women sass him , and any sign of life from this one is gratefully received . " It 'll all work out , " he promises , though Teresa 's aura of fright remains intense and threatens to spread to him . When the girl dares a full smile you see her teeth needed braces and did n't get them . The taste of champagne keeps reminding him of poor Pop . Beer and rusty water and canned mushroom soup . " Try to have some fun , " he tells Pru , and cuts across the jammed room , around the boisterous Murkett-Fosnacht-Janice crowd , to the sofa where Mim sits between the two old ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sister ? " he asks Amy Gehringer . While Grace Stuhl laughs at this Amy struggles to get to her feet . " Do n't get up on my account , " Rabbit tells her . " I just came over to see if I could get any of you anything . " " What I need , " Amy grunts , still floundering , so he pulls her up , " I must get for myself . " " What 's that ? " he asks . She looks at him a little glassily , like Melanie when he told her to drink milk . " A call of nature , " Amy answers , " you could say . "  |p257Grace  Stuhl holds up a hand that when he takes it , to pull her up , feels like a set of worn stones in a sack of the finest driest paper , strangely warm . " I better say goodbye to Becky , " she says . " She 's over there talking the ear off Charlie Stavros , " Harry tells her . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to know the subject ; or does he imagine that ? He drops down onto the sofa beside Mim wearily . " So , " she says . " Next I got ta marry you off , " he says . " I 've been asked , actually , now and then . " " And whajja say ? " " At my age it seemed like too much trouble . " " Your health good ? " " I make it good . No more smoking , notice ? " " How about those crazy hours you keep , staying up to watch 01 ' Blue Eyes ? I knew he was called 01 ' Blue Eyes , by the way . I just did n't know which 01 ' Blue Eyes , I thought a new one might have come along . " When he had called her longdistanceto invite her to the wedding she said she had a date with a very dear friend to see 01 ' Blue Eyes and he had asked , Who 's 01 ' Blue Eyes ? She said Sinatra , ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he answered , You know where I 've been , right here and she said , Yeah , it shows . God , he loves Mim ; in the end there 's nothing to understand you like your own blood . Mim says , " You sleep it off during the day . Anyway I 'm out of the fast lane now , I 'm a businesswoman . " She gestures toward the other side of the room . " What 's Bessie trying to do , keep me from talking to Charlie ? She 's been at him an hour . " " I do n't know what 's going on . " " You never did . We all love you for it . " " Drop dead . Hey how do you like the new Janice ? " " What 's new about her ? " " Do n't you see it ? More confident . More of a woman , some-how. "  | " Hard as a nut , Harry , and always will be . You were always feeling sorry for her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he suddenly says . " You 're getting more and more like him . Especially from the side . " " He never got a gut like mine . " " He did n't have the teeth for all those munchies you like . " " You notice how this Pru looks like him a little ? And Mom 's big red hands . I mean , she seems more of an Angstrom than Nelson . " " You guys like tough ladies . She 's pulled off a trick I did n't think could be pulled off anymore . " He nods , imagining through her eyes his father 's toothless profile closing in upon his own . " She 's running scared . " " And how about you ? " Mim asks . " What 're you doing these days , to feed the inner man ? " " I play golf . " " And still fuck Janice ? " " Sometimes . " " You two . Mother and I did n't give it six months , the way she trapped you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? How does money work , out in Vegas ? You really own a beauty parlor , or you just a front for the big guys ? " " I own thirty-five per cent . That 's what I got for being a front for the big guys . " He nods again . " Sounds familiar . " " You fucking anybody else ? You can tell me , I 'll be on that plane tomorrow . How about the broad bottom over there with the Chinesey eyes ? " He shakes his head . " Nope . Not since Jill . That shook me up . " " O.K. , but ten years , that 's not normal , Harry . You 're letting them turn you into a patsy . " " Remember , " he asks , " how we used to go sledding on Jackson Road ? I often think about it . " " That happened maybe once or twice , it never snows aroundp259here , for Cry-eye . Come out to Lake Tahoe ; now there 's snow . We 'll go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on nut by yourself , we 'll fix you up with somebody really nice . Blonde , brunette , redhead , you name it . Good clean small-town girl too ; nothing crude . " " Mim , " he says , blushing , " you 're the limit , " and thinks of telling her how much he loves her , but there is a commotion at t lie front door . Slim and the organist are leaving together and they encounter t here a dowdy couple who have been ringing the disconnected doorbell for some time . From the look of them they are selling encyclopaedias , except that people do n't do that in pairs , or going door-to-door for the Jehovah 's Witnesses , except that instead of The Watchtower they are holding on to a big silverwrappedwedding present . This is the couple from Binghamton . They took the wrong turn off the Northeast Extension and found themselves lost in West Philadelphia . The woman sheds tears of relief and exhaustion once inside the foyer . " Blocks and blocks of blacks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the wonder of it . " Oh , " Pru cries from across the room , " Uncle Rob ! " and throws herself into his arms , home at last . Ma Springer has made the Poconos place available to the young couple for a honeymoon in these golden last weeks of warm weather  --  the birches beginning to turn , the floats and canoes pulled in from the lake . All of it wasted on the kid , they 'll be lucky if he does n't burn the cottage down frying his brain and his genes with pot . But it 's not Harry 's funeral . Now that Nelson is married it 's like a door has been shut in his mind , a debt has been finally paid , and his thoughts are turning again to that farm south of here where another child of his may be walking , walking and waiting for her life to begin.  |p260One  evening when nothing she likes is on television Ma calls a little conference in the living room , easing her legs wrapped around with flesh-colored bandages ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to visualize an entire creature made out of the flesh the bandage manufacturers are matching , it would make the Hulk look healthy ) up on the hassock and letting the man of the house have the Barcalounger . Janice sits on the sofa with a post-dinner nip of some white creamy poison fermented from coconut milk the kids have brought into the house , looking girlish beside her mother , with her legs tucked up under her . Nice taut legs . She 's kept those and he has to take his hat off to her , tiddly half the time or not . What more can you ask of a wife in a way than that she stick around and see with you what happens next ? Ma Springer announces , " We must settle now what to do with Nelson . " " Send him back to college , " Harry says . " She had an apartmentout there , they can both move into one . " " He does n't want to go , " Janice tells them , not for the first time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the question still excitingto him , though he knows he 's beaten . " Oh Harry , " Janice says wearily , " nobody knows . You did n't go to college , why should he ? " " That 's the reason . Look at me . I do n't want him to live my life . I 'm living it and that 's enough . " " Darling , I said that from his point of view , not to argue with you . Of course Mother and I would have preferred he had graduated from Kent and not got so involved with this secretary . But that 's not the way it is . " " He ca n't go back to college with a wife as if nothing happened , " Bessie states . " They knew her out there as one of the employees and I think he 'd be embarrassed . He needs a job . " " Great , " Harry says , enjoying being perverse , letting the women do the constructive thinking . " Maybe his father-in-law can get him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , " Ma Springer says . " There 's no help there . " " Uncle Rob was a real swinger , though . What does he do up in the shoe factory ? Punch the holes for the laces ? " Janice imitates her mother 's flat , decided rhythm . " Harry . Nelson must come to work at the lot . " " Oh Christ . Why ? Why ? This is a huge country . It has old factories , new factories , farms , stores , why ca n't the lazy brat get a job at one of them ? All those summers he was back from Kent he never got a job . He has n't had a job since that paper route when he was fourteen and needed to buy records . " Janice says , " Going up to the Poconos a month every summer meant he could n't get anything too serious , he used to complain about it . Besides , he did do some things . He babysat for a time there , and he helped that high-school teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels and the cellar full of rocks that stored heat . " " Why does n't he go into something like that ? That 's where the future is , not selling cars . Cars have had it . The party 's over . It 's going to be all public transportation twenty years from now . Ten years from now , even . Why does n't he take a night course and learn how to program a computer ? If you look at the want ads , that 's all there is , computer programmers and electronic engineers . Remember when Nelson rigged up all those hi-fi components and even had speakers hooked up on the sunporch ? He could do all that , what happened ? " " What happened is , he grew up , " Janice says , finishing off the coconut liqueur , tilting her head back so far her throat shows the pale rings that when her head is held normally are wrinkles . Her tongue probes the bottom of the glass . With Nelson and Pru part of the household , Janice drinks more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Johnny Carson or Saturday Night Live , her smoking has gotten back up to over a pack a day in spite of Harry 's nagging to get her to quit . Now in this discussion she 's acting as if he is some natural disturbance they must let boringly run its course.  |p262He  is getting madder . " I offered to take him on in Service , there 's the department they can always use an extra man , Manny 'd have him trained as a full-fledged mechanic in no time . You know what mechanics pull down an hour now ? Seven bucks , and it costs me over eight to pay ' em that what with all this fringe stuff . And once they can work faster than the flat rate they get bonuses . Our top men take home over fifteen thousand a year and a couple of them are n't much older than Nelson . " " Nelson does n't want , " Janice says , " to be a grease monkey any more than you do . " " Happiest days of my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " " It is n't easy , " Ma Springer decides to tell them , " being old , and a widow . In everything I do , after I pray about it , I try to ask myself , Now what would Fred want ? ' And I know with absolute certainty in this instance he would want little Nellie to come work on the lot if that 's what the boy desired . A lot of these young men now would n't want such a job , they do n't have the thick skins a salesman has to have , and it 's not so glamorous , unless you began by following the hind end of a horse around all day the way the people of my generation did . " Rabbit bristles , impatient . " Bessie , every generation has its problems , we all start behind the eight ball . Face the facts . How much you gon na pay Nelson ? How much salary , how much commission ? You know what a dealer 's profit margin is . Three per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut down to nothing by a lot of new overhead you ca n't pass on the customer with these fixed prices Toyota has . Oil going up takes everything up with it ; in the five years I 've been in charge heating costs have doubled , electricity is way up , delivery costs are up , plus all these social security hikes and unemployment to pay so the bums in this country wo n't have to give up their yacht , half the young people in the country go to work just enough to collect unemployment , and now the interest on the inventory is going out of sight . It 's just like the Weimar thing ,  |p263|peo|ple  's savings are being washed right down the tube , everybodyagrees there 's a recession coming to curl your hair . The economy is shot , Ma , we ca n't hack it , we do n't have the disciplinethe Japs and Germans do , and on top of this you want nlc to hire a piece of dead weight who happens to be my son . " " In answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as she shifts the sorer leg on the hassock , " the minimum wage is going to be three-ten an hour so if he works forty hours a week you 'll have to give him a hundred twenty-five a week , and then the bonuses you 'd have to figure on the usual formula , is n't it now something like twenty per cent of the gross profit on the sale , and then going to twenty-five over a certain minimum ? I know it used to be a flat five per cent of the net amount of the sale , but Fred said you could n't do that with foreign cars for some reason . " " Bessie , with all respect , and I love you , but you are crazy . You pay Nelson five hundred a month to start with and set commissions on top of that he 's going to be taking home a thousand a month for bringing in the company only twenty-five hundred . To pay Nelson that amount it should mean he sells , depending on the proportion of new to used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency that does n't move twenty-five a month overall ! " " Well , maybe with Nelson there you 'll move more , " Ma says . " Dreamer , " Harry says to her . " Detroit 's getting tooled up finally to turn out subcompacts a dime a dozen , and there 's goingto be stiffer import taxes any day now . Twenty-five a month is optimum , honest to God . " " The people that remember Fred will like to see Nelson there , " she insists . Janice says , " Nelson says the mark-up on the new Toyotas is at least a thousand dollars . " " That 's a loaded model , with all the extras . The people who buy Toyotas are n't into extras . Basic Corollas are what we sell mostly , four to one . And even on the bigger models the carry/ing costs amount to a couple hundred per unit with money going to Hell the way it is . " She is obstinate and dumb . " A thousand a car , " she says , " means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you figure it . " " What about Jake and Rudy ! " he cries . " How could the kid sell even five without cutting into Jake and Rudy ? Listen , if you two want to know who your loyal employees are , it 's Jake and Rudy . They work all the shit hours you ask ' em to , on the floor nights and weekends , they moonlight to make up for all the low hours you tell ' em to stay away , Rudy runs a little bike repair shop out of his garage , in this day and age , everybodyelse begging for handouts , they 're still taking a seventyfivebase and a one-fifty draw . You ca n't turn guys like that out in the cold . " " I was n't thinking so much of Jake and Rudy , " Ma Springer says , with a frown resting one ankle on top of the other . " How much now does Charlie make ? " " Oh no you do n't . We 've been through this . Charlie goes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , Charlie pulls down around three-fifty a week  --  rounds out to over twenty thousand a year with the bonuses . " " Well , then , " Ma Springer pronounces , easing the ankle back to where it was , " you 'd actually save money , taking Nelson on instead . He has this interest in the used cars , and that 's Charlie 's department , has n't it been ? " " Bessie , I ca n't believe this . Janice , talk to her about Charlie . " " We 've talked , Harry . You 're making too much of it . Mother has talked to me and I thought it might do Charlie good to make a change . She also talked to Charlie and he agreed . " Harry is disbelieving . " When did you talk to Charlie ? " " At the reception , " Ma Springer admits . " I saw you looking over at us . " " Well my God , whajja say ? " This is some old lady , Rabbit thinks , sneakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffy throat , funny silver/browed eyeglasses , and all . Once in a while , in the winters since old Fred cashed in , she has visited the lot wearing the mink coat he gave her for their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary , and there was a glitter on that fur like needles of steel , like a signal crackling out of mission control . She says , " I asked him how his health was . " " The way we worry about Charlie 's health you 'd think he was in a wheelchair . " " Janice has told me , even ten years ago he was taking nitroglycerine . For a man only in his thirties then , that 's not good . " " Well what did he say , how his health was ? " " Fair , " Ma Springer answers , giving it the local two syllables , Fai-ir . " Janice herself claims you complain he does n't do his share anymore , just sits huddled at the desk playing with paperworkhe should leave for Mildred to do . " " Did I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayer . He has always thought of her darkness as a Springer trait but of course old man Springer was fair , thin-skinned pink ; it is her mother 's blood , the Koerners ' , that has determined her coloring . She flicks her cigarette at the ashtray impatiently . " More than once , " she says . " Well I did n't mean your mother should go fire the guy . " " Fire was never used as a word , " Ma Springer says . " Fred would never have fired Charlie , unless his personal life got all out of hand . " " You got to go pretty far to get out of hand these days , " Harry says , resenting that this is the case . Ma Springer rolls her weight uncomfortably on the sofa . " Well I must say , this chasing that girl out to Ohio  --  " " He took her to Florida , too , " Harry says , so quickly both women stare at him with their button-black eyes . It 's true , it galls him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Melanie himself and had nowhere to take her anyhow . " We talked about Florida , " Ma Springer says . " I asked him if now that winter 's coming he might n't be better off down there . Amy Gehringer 's son-in-law , that used to work in anp266asbestos plant in New Jersey until they got that big scare , has retired down there on the compensation , and he 's under fifty . She says he tells her there are a lot of young people coming down there now , to get away from the oil crisis , it 's not just the old people like in all the jokes , and of course there are jobs to be had there too . Charlie 's clever . Fred recognized that from the start . " " He has this mother , Ma . An old Greek lady who ca n't speak English and who 's never been out of Brewer hardly . " " Well maybe it 's time she was . You know people think we old people are such sticks in the mud but Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and buried two husbands right in the county , went out to visit her son in Phoenix and loved it so she 's bought her own little condominium and even , Grace was telling me , her burial plot , that 's how much she pulled up her roots . " " Charlie 's not like you , Harry , " Janice explains . " He 's not scared of change . " He could take that green glass egg and in one stride be at the sofa and pound it down into her dense skull . Instead he ignores her , saying to Ma , " I still have n't heard exactly what you said to Charlie , and he said to you . " " Oh , we reminisced . We talked about the old days with Fred and we agreed that Fred would want Nellie to have a place at the lot . He was always one for family , Fred , even when family let him down . " That must mean him , Rabbit thinks . Letting that shifty little wheeler-dealer down is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , " Janice interposes , in that smooth matronly voice she can do now but that sounds phony at this moment . " All the time I was , you know , seeing him , he was absolutely ready to stand aside and have me go back . " Bragging about her affair to her own mother . The world is running down fast . " And so , " Ma Springer sighs  --  she is wearying of this , her legs hurt and are n't improving , old people need their privacy " we tried to come to an understanding of what Fred would want and came up with this idea of a leave for Charlie , for six months with half pay , and then at the end we 'd see how Nellie was working out . In the meantime if the offer of another job comes Charlie 's way he 's to be free to take it , and then we 'll settle at that point with two months ' pay as a bonus , plus whateverhis Christmas bonus would be for all of 1979 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over there today while you were playing golf . " He had been carrying an 83 into the last hole and then hooked into the creek and took an 8 . It seems he 'll never break 90 there , unless he does it in his sleep . Webb Murkett 's relaxed swing is getting on his nerves . " Sneaky , " he says . " I thought you did n't trust yourself to drive the Chrysler in Brewer traffic anymore . " " Janice drove me over . " " Aha . " He asks his wife , " How did Charlie like seeing you there on this mission of mercy ? " " He was sweet . This has all been between him and Mother . But he knows Nelson is our son . Which is more than you seem to . " No , no , I know he is , that 's the trouble , " Harry tells her . To old lady Springer he says , " So you 're paying Charlie thousands to hand Nelson a job he probably ca n't do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 're going to lose sales without Charlie , I do n't have half the contacts around town he does . Not just Greeks , either . Being single he 's been in a lot of bars , that 's where you win people 's trust around here . " " Well , it may be . " Ma Springer gets herself to her feet and stamps each one softly on the carpet , testing if either is asleep . " It may all be a mistake , but in this life you ca n't always be afraid of mistakes . I never liked that about Charlie , that he was unwilling to get married . It bothered Fred too , I know . Now I must get myself upstairs and see my Angels . Though it 's not been the same since Farrah left . " " Do n't I get a vote ? " Harry asks , almost yelling , strapped asp268he feels into the Barcalounger . " I vote against it . I do n't want to be bothered with Nelson over there . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has time to appreciatehow big she is , how broad from certain angles , like a tree trunk seen suddenly in terms of all the toothpicks it would make , all those meals and days gone into this bulk , the stiff heavy seesaw of her hips , the speckled suet of her arms , " as I understand Fred 's will , he left the lot to me and Janice , and I think we 're of a mind . " " Two against three , Harry , in any case , " Janice says , with a winning smile . " Oh screw you , " he says . " Screw Springer Motors . I supposeif I do n't play dead doggie you two 'll vote to can me too . " They do n't deny it . While Ma 's steps labor up the staircase , Janice , beginning to wear that smudged look she gets when the day 's intake catches up with her , gets to her feet and tells him confidentially , " Mother thought you 'd take it worse than you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addictive . " October first falls on a Monday . Autumn is starting to show its underside : out of low clouds like a row of torn mattresses a gray rain is knocking the leaves one by one off the trees . That lonely old maple behind the Chuck Wagon across Route 111 is bare now down to its lower branches , which hang on like a monk 's fringe . Not a day for customers : Harry and Charlie gaze together through the plate glass windows where the posters now say COMING , ALL NEw COROLLAS  --  New 1.8-liter engineNew aerodynamic styling  --  Aluminum wheels on SRS models  --  Removable sunroof /moonroo f  --  Best selling car in the world ! Another paper banner proclaims THE COROLLA TERCEL  --  First Front-Wheel Drive Toyota  --  Toyota 's Lowest Price &; Highest Mileage  --  33 Est . MPG  --  43 EPA Estimated Highway MPG . " Well , " Harry says , after clearing his throat , " the Phillies wentp269out with a bang . " By shutting out the Montreal Expos on the last day of the season , 2-0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League East . " I was rooting for the Expos , " Charlie says . " Yeah , you hate to see Pittsburgh win again . They 're so fuckingjivey . All that Family crap . " Stavros shrugs . " Well , a team of blacks like that , you need a slogan . They all grew up on television commercials , the box was the only mother they had . That 's the tragedy of blacks these days . " It relieves Harry , to hear Charlie talk . He came in half expecting to find him crushed . " At least the Eagles screwed the Steelers , " he says . " That felt good . " " They were lucky . That fumble going into the end zone . Bradshaw you can expect to throw some interceptions , but you do n't expect Franco Harris to fumble going into the end zone . " Harry laughs aloud , in remembered delight . " How about that barefoot rookie kicker the Eagles got ? Was n't that beautiful ? " Charlie says , " Kicking is n't football . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have a big toe like a rock . " " For my money they can ship all these old soccer players back to Argentina . The contact in the line , that 's football . The Pit . That 's where the Steelers will get you in the end . I 'm not worried about the Steelers . " Harry sniffs anger here and changes the subject , looking out at the weather . Drops on the glass enlarge and then abruptly dart down , dodgingly , leaving trails . The way he wept . Ever since earliest childhood , his consciousness dawning by the radiatorsin the old half-house on Jackson Road , it has been exciting for Harry to stand near a window during a rain , his face inches from the glass and dry , where a few inches away it would be wet . " Wonder if it 's going to rain on the Pope . " The Pope is flying into Boston that afternoon . " Never . He 'll just wave his arms and the sky 'll be full of bluebirds . Bluebirds and horseshit. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit rude ; no doubt about it , Charlie is prickly this morning . " Ja see those crowds on television ? The Irish went wild . One crowd was over a million , they said . " " Micks are dumb , " Charlie says , and starts to turn away . " I got ta get hot on some NV-1s . " Harry ca n't let him go . He says , " And they gave the old Canal back last night . " " Yeah . I get sick of the news . This country is sad , everybody can push us around . " " You were the guy wanted to get out of Vietnam . " " That was sad too . " " Hey . " " Yeah ? " " I hear you had a talk with Ma Springer . " " The last of a long series . She 's not so sad . She 's tough . " " Any thoughts about where you 're going to be going ? " Nelsonand Pru are due back from the Poconos Friday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hit a few bars . " " How about Florida , you 're always talking about Florida . " " Come on . I ca n't ask the old lady to move down there . Whatwould she do , play shuffleboard ? " " I thought you said you had a cousin taking care of her now . " " Gloria . I do n't know , something 's cooking there . She and her husband may be getting back together . He does n't like scrambling his own eggs in the morning . " " Oh . Sorry . " Harry pauses . " Sorry about everything . " Charlie shrugs . " What can you do ? " This is what he wants to hear ; relief bathes him like a kind of light . When you feel better , you see better ; he sees all the papers , wrappers and take-out cup lids that have blown across the highway from the Chuck Wagon , lying in the bushes just outside the window , getting soaked . He says , " I could quit myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Me , I can sellp271anywhere , that 's no worry . Already I 've had some feelers . News travels fast in this business . It 's a scared business . " " I told her , Ma , Charlie 's the heart of Springer Motors . Half the clients come in because of him . More than half . ' " " I appreciate your putting in a word . But you know , there comes a time . " " I guess . " But not for Harry Angstrom . Never , never . " How about Jan ? What 'd she have to say about giving me the gate ? " A tough question . " Not much , that I heard . You know she ca n't stand up to the old lady ; never could . " " If you want to know what I think cooked my goose , it was that trip with Melanie . That cooled it with both the Springer girls . " " You think Janice still cares that much ? " " You do n't stopcaring , champ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw in kindergarten . Once you care , youalways care . That 's how stupid we are . " A rock in space , is the image these words bring to Rabbit 's mind . He is interested in space , and scans the paper every day for more word on these titanic quasars on the edge of everything , and in the Sunday section studies the new up-close photos of Jupiter , expecting to spot a clue that all those scientists have missed ; God might have a few words to say yet . In the vacuum of the heart love falls forever . Janice jealous of Charlie , we get these ideas and ca n't let go , it 's been twenty years since he slept with Ruth but whenever in some store downtown or along Weiser he sees from behind a woman with gingery hair bundled up carelessly behind , a few loops flying loose , his heart bumps up . And Nelson , he was young at the time but you 're never too young to fall , he loved Jill and come to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair flat down the back and that numb look daring you to hurt her , though Jill of course was of a better class , she was no Akron steamfitter 's daughter . Harry says to Charlie , " Well at least now you can run out to Ohio from time to time . "  |p272Charlie  says , " There 's nothing out there for me . Melanie 's more like a daughter . She 's smart , you know . You ought to hear her go on about transcendental meditation and this crazy Russian philosopher . She wants to go on and get a Ph.D . if she can worm the money out of her father . He 's out there on the West Coast fucking Indian maidens . " Coast to coast , Rabbit thinks , we 're one big funhouse . It 's done with mirrors . " Still , " he tells Charlie , " I wish I had some of your freedom . " " You got freedom you do n't even use . How come you and Jan keep living in that shabby old barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , it 's keeping her childish . " Shabby ? Harry had never thought of the Springer place as shabby : old-fashioned maybe but with big rooms full of the latest and best goods , just the way he saw it the first time , when he began to take Janice out , the summer they were both workingat Kroll 's . Everything looked new and smelled so clean , and in the side room off the living room a long wrought-iron table held a host of tropical plants , a jungle of their own that seemed the height of luxury . Now the table stands there hollow and you can see where it 's stained the hardwood floor with rusty drippings . And he thinks of the gray sofa and the wallpaper and watercolors that have n't changed since the days he used to pick Jan up for a night of heavy petting in the back of Pop 's old De Soto and maybe it is shabby . Ma does n't have the energy she did and what she does with all her money nobody knows . Not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper beech outside their bedroom window is dropping its nuts , the little triangular seedpods explode and with all the rustling and cracklingit 's not so easy to sleep . That room has never been ideal . " Childish , huh ? " " Speaking of which , " Charlie says , " remember those two kids who came in at the beginning of the summer , the girl that turned you on ? The boy came back Saturday , while you were out on the golf course , I ca n't think of his name . "  | " Nunemacher . " " Right . He bought that orange Corolla liftback with standard transmission out on the lot . No trade-in , and these new models coming in , I quoted him two hundred off the list . I thought you 'd want me to be nice to him . " " Right . Was the girl with him ? " " Not that I could see . " " And he did n't trade in that Country Squire ? " " You know these farmers , they like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a band saw . " " My God , " Harry says . " Jamie bought the orange Corolla . " " Well come on , it 's not that much of a miracle . I asked him why he waited so long and he said he thought if he waited to fall the ' 79s would be down in price a little . And the dollar would be worth less . The yen too as it turns out . " " When 's he taking delivery ? " " He said around noon tomorrow . That 's one of the NV-1s I got ta do . " " Shit . That 's when I have Rotary . " " The girl was n't with him , what do you care ? You talk about me ; she was younger than Melanie . That girl might have been as young as sixteen , seventeen . " " Nineteen is what she 'd be , " Rabbit says . " But you 're right . I do n't care . " Rain all around them leads his heart upward by threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday after Rotary with the drinks still working in him Harry goes back to the lot and sees the orange Corolla gone and can hardly focus with happiness , God has kissed him out of space . Around four-thirty , with Rudy on the floor and Charlie over in Allenville trying to wrap up a used-car package with a dealer there to clear the books a little before Nelson takes over , he eases out of his office and down the corridor and out throughp274the shop where Manny 's men are still whacking metal but their voices getting louder as the bliss of quitting time approaches and out the back door , taking care not to dirty his shirt cuffs on the crash bar , and out into air . Paraguay . On this nether portion of the asphalt the Mercury with its mashed-in left side and fender and grille still waits upon a decision . It turns out Charlie was able to unload the repaired Royale for thirty-six hundred to a young doctor from Royersford , he was n't even a regular doctor but one of these homeopathic or holistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles and tells you to eat carrots or just hum at a certain pitch for three hours a day , he must be doing all right because he snapped up that old Olds , said a guy he admired at college had driven one like it and he 'd always wanted one just that color , evidently  --  that purply-red nail-polish color . Harry squeezes himself into his Corona the color of tired tomato soup and slides out of the lot softly and heads down 111 the way away from Brewer , toward Galilee . Springer Motors well behind him , he turns on the radio and that heavy electrified disco beat threatens to pop the stereo speakers . Tinny sounds , wiffling sounds , sounds like a kazoo being played over the telephone come at him from the four corners of the vinyl-upholstered interior , setting that hopeful center inside his ribs to jingling . He thinks back to the Rotary luncheon and Eddie Pastorelli of Pastorelli Realty with his barrel chest and stiff little bow legs now , that used to do the 440 in less than fifty seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the upper blocks of Weiser , which were mostly parking lots and bars these days , and little businesses like vacuum-cleaner repair and pet supplies that had n't had the capital to move out to the malls , Eddie trying to tell them that some big glass boxes and a corkscrew-ramped concrete parking garage are going to bring the shoppers back in spite of all the spic kids roaming around with transistors glued to their ears and knives up their wrists . Harry has to laugh , he remembers Eddie when he was a second-string guard for Hem/migtown High , a meaner greaseball never stayed out of reform school . Donna Summer comes on singing , Dim all the lights sweet darling . . . When you see pictures of her she 's much less black than you imagine , a thin-cheeked yellow staring out at you like what are you going to do about it . The thing about those Rotarians , if you knew them as kids you ca n't stop seeing the kid in them , dressed up in fat and baldness and money like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you respect the world when you see it 's being run by a bunch of kids turned old ? That 's the joke Rabbit always enjoys at Rotary . With a few martinis inside him Eddie can he funny as hell , when he told that joke about the five men in the airplane the tip of his nose bent down like it was on a little string and his laugh came out as an old woman 's wheeze . Knapsack ! hee hee hee . Rabbit must try to remember and try it out on the gang at the Flying Eagle . Five men : a hippie , a priest , a policeman , and Henry Kissinger , the smartest man in the world . But who was the fifth ? Donna Summer says to turn her brown body white , at least that 's what he thinks she 's said , you ca n't be sure with all this disco wowowow , some doped-up sound engineer wiggling the knobs to give that sound , the words do n't matter , it 's that beat pushed between your ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sandstone . A billboard pointing to a natural cave . He wonders who goes there anymore , natural caves a thing of the past , like waterfalls . Men in straw hats . Women with not even their ankles showing . Natural wonders . That smartass young female announcer  --  he has n't heard her for a while , he thought maybe the station had fired her , too sassy or got pregnant  --  comeson and says that the Pope has addressed the UN and is stopping in Harlem on his way to Yankee Stadium . Harry saw the cocky little guy on television last night , getting soaked in Boston in his white robes , you had to admire his English , about his seventh language , and who was the deadpan guy standing there holding the umbrella over him ? Somep276Vatican bigwig , but Pru did n't seem to know any more than he did , what 's the good of being raised a Catholic ? In Europe , gold rose today to a new high of four hundred forty-four dollars an ounce while the dollar slipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road twists among the hilly fields . Harry calculates , up eighty dollars in less than three weeks , thirty times eighty is two thousand four hundred , when you 're rich you get richer , just like Pop used to say . In some of the fields the corn stands tall , others are stubble . He glides through the ugly string town of Galilee , on the lookout for the orange Corolla . No need to ask at the post office this time . The vegetablestand is closed for the season . The pond has some geese on it , he does n't remember those , migrating already , the green little turds they leave all over the fairways , maybe that was the reason that doctor . . . He turns off the radio . BLANKENBILLER . MUTH . BYER . He parks on the same widened spot of red dirt road shoulder . His heart is pounding , his hands feel swollen and numb , resting on the steering wheel . He turns off the ignition , digging himself in deeper . It 's not as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car , the pigsty whiff is n't in the air , the wind is from the other direction , and there is no insect hum . They have died , millions . Across the silence cuts the far-off whine and snarl of a chain saw . The new national anthem . Oho say can you saw . . . The woods are a half-mile off and ca n't be part of the Byer farm . He begins to trespass . The hedgerow that has swallowed the stone wall is less leafy , he is less hidden . A cool small wind slips through the tangled black gum and wild cherry and licks his hands . Poison ivy leaves have turned , a Mercurochromered , some of them half-dyed as if dipped . As he ventures down through the old orchard , a step at a time , he treads on fallen apples lying thick in the grass grown to hay . Must n't turn an ankle , lie up here and rot as well . Poor trees , putting out all this wormy fruit for nothing . Perhaps not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exist they were doing the same . Strange thought . Harry looks down uponp277the farmhouse now , the green door , the birdbath on its pale blue pillar . Smoke is rising from the chimney ; the nostalgic smell of burning wood comes to him . So close , he gets behind a dyingapple tree with a convenient fork at the height of his head . Ants are active in the velvety light brown rot inside the trunk , touching noses , telling the news , hurrying on . The tree trunk is split open like an unbuttoned overcoat but still carries life up through its rough skin to the small round leaves that tremble where the twigs are young and smooth . Space feels to drop away not only in front of him but on all sides , even through the solid earth , and he wonders what he is doing here in his good beige suit , his backside exposed to any farmer with a shotgun who might be walking along in the field behind him and his face posed in this fork like a tin can up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , he who has an officewith his name on the door and CHIEF SALES REPRESENTATIVE onhis business cards and who a few hours back was entertaining other men in suits with the expense and complications of his son 's wedding , the organist going off with this Slim and the couple turning up so late he thought they were Jehovah 's Witnesses ; and for some seconds of panic can not answer himself why , except that out here , in the air , nameless , he feels purely alive . Then he remembers : he hopes to glimpse his daughter . And what if he were to gather all his nerve and go down and knock at the green door in its deep socket of wall and she were to answer ? She would be in jeans this time of year , and a sweatshirtor sweater . Her hair would be less loose and damp than in its summer do , maybe pulled back and held by a rubber band . Her eyes , widely spaced , would be pale blue little mirrors . Hi . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm more than that , I think . Like what ? Is your mother 's name by any chance Ruth Byer ? Well . . . yes.  |p278And  has she ever talked to you about your father ? My father 's dead . He used to run the school buses for the township . That was n't your father . I 'm your father . And that broad pale face in which he saw his own would stare at him furious , disbelieving , fearful . And if he did at last make her believe , she would be angry at him for taking from her the life she had lived and substituting for it one she could never live now . He sees that these fields where his seed may have taken hold hold nothing of harvest for him but , if he seize it , the space at his back to escape in . Yet he stands , in his tired summer suit  --  time to have it cleaned and stored in the big plastic clothes bag until next April  --  transfixed by the motionlessnessof the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races in steady alarm at his having strayed so far off track . You have a life and there are these volumes on either side that go unvisited ; some day soon as the world winds he will lie beneath what he now stands on , dead as those insects whose sound he no longer hears , and the grass will go on growing , wild and blind . His idling heart jumps at a rustle close behind him in the orchard . He has lifted his arms and framed the first words of his self-explanation before he sees that the other presence is not a person but a dog , an old-looking collie with one red eye and its coat loaded with burrs . Rabbit is uncomfortable with dogs anyway and knows collies to be especially nervous and prone to attack , Lassie to the contrary . This dog is blacker than Lassie . It stands the length of a long putt away , head cocked , the hair behind its ears electric , set to bark . " Hi , " Harry says , his voice a hoarse shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The collie cocks its narrow head at a sharper tilt , as if to favor the sore eye , and the long white hair around its throat like a bib riffles where the breeze flattens it . " You a good doggie ? " Harry asks . He envisions the distance to the car , sees himself running , the dog at his legs in two seconds , the tearing of cloth , the pointed yellowish canines , thep279way dogs lift that black split upper lip to bare the little front teeth in fury ; he feels his ankle pinned as if between two grindingcogwheels , his fall , his arms up in a futile attempt to save his face . But the dog makes a decision in its narrow skull . Its dropped tail cautiously wags , and it lopes forward with that horrible silent lightness of four-footed animals through the orchard grass . It sniffs at Harry 's knees and then leans against his legs , allowing its neck to be scratched as Harry keeps up a whispered patter . " Nice boy , good girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't let them smell your terror . You sure know you 're out in the country when you meet dogs running around without collars just like bears . Distantly , a car door slams . The sound echoes off the barn wall so that at first he looks in the wrong spot . Then he sees through the fork of the apple tree , about a six-iron away allowingfor the slope , the orange Corolla in the big bare spot between the house and the garage , which has the yellow shell of the school bus behind it . So a wild hope is confirmed , but most of his mind stays with the opaque bundle of muscle and teeth at his knees , how to keep it from barking , how to keep it from biting . Tiny brains , change in a second , a collie belonging to old Mrs. Haas down Jackson Road lived in a barrel , snapped one time when nobody expectedit , he still has the faint white scar on two middle fingers , pulling them loose felt like skinning a carrot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car door slam and , flattening its ears , rockets down through the orchard . Around the Corolla it sets up a barking that is frantic but remote , delayed by echo and space . Harry seizes the moment to scurry back to a tree farther away . From there he sees the car 's driver step out , lanky Jamie , no longer wearing dirty dungarees but pinkish bell-bottoms and a red turtleneck shirt . The collie jumps up and down , greeting , apologizing for barking at the unfamiliar car . The boy 's drawl drifts up through the orchard , doing singsong dog talk , the words indistinct . Rabbit drops his eyes a moment to the earth ,  |p280where  two yellowjackets are burrowing into a rotten apple . When he looks again , a girl , the girl , her round white face unmistakable , her hair shorter than in June , steps out of the Corolla'spassenger side and hunkers down to the dog , mingling herself with its flurry . She turns her face away from a thrust of the dog 's muzzle and stares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watches . He sees when she stands that she is dressed trimly , in dark brown skirt and russet sweater , a little plaid jacket squaring up her shoulders so she looks sharp , collegiate , a city girl . Still there is that certain languor of her legs as she takes a stride or two toward the house . Her voice lifts in calling . Both their young faces have turned to the house , so Rabbit takes the opportunity to retreat to yet a farther tree , slimmer than the one previous . But he is close to the tangled hedgerow now and perhaps against this invisible in his light suit , camouflaged among pieces of sky . Down below , echoing off the stucco and cinder-block walls , the cries of greeting and pleasure have a melancholy , drifting sound . From out of the house , following a thin slam of its door , a fat elderly woman has emerged , moving under the burden of her own weight so cautiously that the collie , herding , nudges her forward , encircling her legs . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon when it went by the church on the day of the wedding , but it can not be Ruth , for her hair , that had been a kind of soft and various wiry fire , is an iron cap of gray fitted to her head , and her body is enormous , so big her clothes from this distance seem wide as a sail . In pants and shirt this person advances plodding to admire the new car . There is no exchange of kisses , but from the way they all rotate and slide one past another these three are well acquainted . Their voices drift to Harry unintelligibly . The boy demonstrates the liftback . The girl taps the old woman , as if to say , Go on ; she is being teased . Then they fish from the car 's interior two tall brown paper bags , groceries , and the collie dog , bored with these proceedings , lifts its headp281and points its nose in the direction where Harry , his heart thunderous , is holding as still as the man concealed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sunday papers . The dog begins to bark and races up into the orchard toward him ; Harry has no choice but to turn and run . Perhaps he makes it through the hedgerow before the people look up and see him . They call out for the dog  --  " Fritzie ! Fritzie ! "  --  in two female voices . Twigs scratch his hands ; the loose stones of the old wall nearly trip him , and scuff one shoe . Now he flies . The red earth marred by tractor treads skims underfoot . Yet the dog , he sees glancing behind , will overtake him before he can reach the car ; already the creature , its hair and ears swept flat by its speed , has broken through the hedgerow and is streaming along beside the corn stubble . Oh Christ . Rabbit stops , wraps his arms around his face , and waits . The house is out of sight below the rise of land ; he is all alone with this . He hears the dog 's claws rattle past him in momentum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He feels his legs being nosed through his trousers , then leaned on . The dog does n't want to bring him down but to gather him in , to herd him also . " Nice Fritzie , " Harry says . " Good Fritzie . Let 's go to my car . Let 's trot along . " Foot by careful foot he consumes the little distance to the shoulder of the road , the dog bumping and sniffinghim all the way . The cries from the house , invisible , persist raggedly ; the collie 's tail , uncertainly wagging , pats Harry 's calves while the long skull inquires upward with its sick red eye . Harry pulls his hands up to the level of his lapels . Dirty yellow drooly teeth would skin his fingers like a carrot grater . He tells Fritzie , " You 're a beautiful girl , a wonderful girl , " and eases around the back of the Corona . The chain saw is still zippingalong . He opens the driver 's door and slides in . Slams it . The collie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shepherding come to an end . Harry finds the car key in his pocket , the engine starts . His heart is still pounding . He leans over toward the passenger 's window and scrabbles hisp282fingers on the glass . " Hey Fritzie ! " he shouts and keeps up the scrabbling until the dog starts to bark again . Bark . Bark bark bark . Laughing , Rabbit pops the clutch and digs out , the thing inside his chest feeling fragile and iridescent like a big soap bubble . Let it pop . He has n't felt so close to breaking out of his rut since Nelson smashed those convertibles . Webb Murkett is handy about the house ; he has a cellar full of expensive power tools and subscribes to magazines with titles like Fine Woodworking and Homecra f t . In every corner of the garrison colonial he and Cindy have shared for the seven years of their marriage there are hand-made refinements of rounded , stained , and varnished wood  --  shelves , cabinets , built-in lazy susans with as many compartments as a seashell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . There is a way of working with rotten wood , and making it as solid as marble , and like marble swirled and many-shaded ; this art is on display in the base of several lamps and in a small bowl holdingan untouched spiral of cigarettes on the butler's-tray table , which Webb has also fashioned , down to its gleaming copper hinges shaped like butterflies . Some of these objects must have come from the homes of Webb 's previous marriages , and Harry wonders what these phantom women have kept , that so much remains . Webb 's previous marriages are represented in his great long sunken living room only by color photographs , in ensembleframes of unusual proportion that Webb himself has cut and grooved and cemented together of Lucite , of children too old to be his and Cindy 's , caught in a moment of sunshine on the flagstone stoop of another suburban house , or in a sailboatagainst the blue of a lake that the Kodak chemicals are permitting to fade to yellow , or at a moment of marriage or graduation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Nelson , and infants of a third generation stare out un/smiling , propped on a pillow or held in firm young arms , from among the many smiles of these family groups . Harry has several times in Webb 's house slyly searched these photos for the sight of a former wife ; but though there are women beheaded or sliced to a splinter by the edge of a frame or another picture , and here and there an unidentifiable mature hand and forearm intrudes behind a set of children 's heads , no face seems preserved of the vanished mistresses of all this fleeting family happiness . When Webb and Cindy entertain , built-in speakers bathe the downstairs rooms in a continuous sweetness of string music and spineless arrangements , of old show tunes or mollified rock classics , voiceless and seamless and with nagging dental associationsfor Harry . Behind a mahogany bar that Webb salvaged from the tavern of a farmer 's hotel being demolished in Brewer and then transported with its brass rail to a corner of his living room , he has constructed a kind of altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet in a point and shelves that come forward on a lazy-tongs principle with not only the basics of whiskey , gin , and vodka but exotic drinks like rum and tequila and saki and all the extras you could want from bitters to powdered Old-Fashioned mix in little envelopes . And the bar has its own small refrigerator , built in . Much as he admires Webb , Harry thinks when he gets his own dream house he will do without the piped music and such elaborate housing for the liquor . The bathroom , though , enchants him , with its little enamelled dishes of rosebud-shaped soap and furry blue toilet seat cover and its dazzling mirror rimmed with naked light bulbs like actors have in their dressing rooms . Everything in here that does n't shine is tinted and scented . The toilet paper , very dulcet , is printed with old comic strips , each piece a panel . Poor Popeye , eating shit instead of spinach . And the towels have W and M and L for Lucinda intertwined in such a crusty big monogram he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet underparts if she forgot and rubbed herself hard . But Harry wonders if this downstairs bathroom is ever used by the Murketts and theirp284rather pasty-looking little kids or is set up primarily for guests . Certain mysterious artifacts in it  --  a big sort of sugar bowl , white , with a knobbed lid painted with two women dressed in filmy gowns sitting on clouds or a sofa that fades into nothing , and their feet in pink ballerina shoes and their ankles crossed and the toes of one woman touching the other 's and one bare arm of each intertwined above the knob , yet when the lid is lifted utterly empty , so empty you feel nothing has ever been put inside ; and a pink plastic hand on a stick , meant maybe for a comic backscratcher ; and an egg-shaped jar a third full of lavender crystalline salts ; and a kind of tiny milkman 's carrier of what he takes to be bath oils ; and a flexible plastic cylinder holding a pastel rainbow of powder puffs like a stack of pancakes  --  allseem put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two black dowels between the bathtub and the toilet , for exhibitmore than use . To think of little Cindy though , pouring that oil into her bath and then just soaking there , playing with herself with the backscratcher , her nipples poking through the blanket of soapsuds . Harry feels sexy . In the mirror that makes things too vivid his eyes stare with a pallor almost white like the little frost-flowers that appear on the skin of a car in the morning and his lips look bluish ; he is drunk . He has had two tequila fizzes before dinner , as much Gallo Chablis as he could grab during the meal , and a brandy and a half afterwards . In the middle of the second brandy the need to urinate came upon him like yet another pressure of happiness , added to his health and prosperity and the privilege of being there sitting across a coffee table from Cindy watching her body rotate within the strange coarse cloth of the exotic Arab-looking thing she is wearing , her wrists and her feet , bare but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her thighs in a bikini . Besides himself and Janice the Murketts have invited the Harrisons and for a new thrill the moronic Fosnachts , whom they just met at Nelson 's wedding two weeks ago . Harry does n't suppose the Murketts know he and Peggy had a fling years back when 011ie had donep285one of his copouts , but maybe they do , people know more than you ever think they do , and it turns out it does n't much matter . Look at what you read every week in People magazine , and you still keep watching television , the actors all dope addicts and adulterers . He has an urge to look into the medicine cabinet framed by the rim of showbiz bulbs and waits until a gale of laughter from the drunken bunch in the living room arises to drown out any possible click of him opening the mirror-door . Click . The cabinet has more in it than he would have supposed : thick milk-glass jars of skin cream and flesh-tint squeeze bottles of lotion and brown tubes of suntan lotion , Parepectolin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chloraseptic , that mouthwash called Cepacol , several kinds of aspirin , both Bayer and Anacin , and Tylenol that does n't make your stomach burn , and a large chalky bottle of liquid Maalox . He wonders which of the Murketts needs Maalox , they both always look so relaxed and at peace . The pink poison ivy goo would be downstairs handy for the kids , and the Band-Aids , but how about the little flat yellow box of Preparation H for hemorrhoids ? Carter of course has hemorrhoids , that grim over-motivated type who wants to do everything on schedule ready or not , pushing , pushing , but old Webb Murkett with that gravelly voice and easy swing , like the swing you see crooners use at celebrity tournaments , unwrapping one of those little wax bullets and poking it up his own asshole ? You have to go into a squat and the place is not easy to find , Rabbit remembers from his own experience , years ago , when he was sitting all day at the Linotype on that hard steel bench , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of his fingertips , every slip a ruined slug , everybody around him unhappy , the kid still small , his own life closed in to a size his soul had not yet shrunk to fit . And what of these amber pill bottles with Lucinda R. Murkett typed in pale blue script face on the prescription labels ? White pills , lethally small . He should have brought his reading glasses . Harry is tempted to lift one of these containers off its shelf in hopes ofp286deciphering what illness might have ever found its way into that plump and supple delectable body , but a superstitious fear of fingerprints restrains him . Medicine cabinets are tragic , he sees by this hard light , and closes the door so gently no one will hear the click . He returns to the living room . They are discussing the Pope 's visit , loudly . " Did you see , " Peggy Fosnacht is shouting , " what he said in Chicago yesterday about sex ! " The years since Harry knew her have freed her to stop wearing dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her person and opinions both ; she 's become the kind of woman who looks permanently out of press , as a protest of sorts . " He said everything outside marriage was wrong . Not just if you 're married , but before you 're married too . What does that man know ? He does n't know anything about life , life as she is lived . " Webb Murkett offers in a soft voice , trying to calm his guest down , " I liked what Earl Butz said some years ago . He no play-a the game , he no make-a the rules . ' " Webb is wearing a maroon turtleneck under a coarse yarny gray sweater that has something to do , Rabbit thinks , with Scandinavian fishermen . The way the neck is cut . Harry and Ronnie came in suits ; 011ie was with-it enough to know you do n't wear suits out even on a Saturday night anymore . He came in tight faded jeans and an embroidered shirt that made him look like a cowboy too runty to be out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy Fosnacht yells . " See if you 're a pregnant slum mother and ca n't get an abortion legally if you think it 's such a game . " Rabbit says to her , " Webb 's agreeing with you , " but she does n't hear him , babbling on headlong , face flushed by wine and the exciting class of company , her hairdo coming uncurled like taffy softening in the sun . " Did any of you watch except me  --  I ca n't stop watching , I get so furious  --  the performance he put on in Philly where he said absolutely No to women priests ? And he kept smiling , whatp287really got my goat , he kept smiling while spouting all this sexist crap about only men in the priesthood and how it was the conviction of the church and God 's decision and all that , so solly . He 's so smooth about it , I think is what gets to me , at least somebody like Nixon or Hitler had the decency to be frantic . " " He is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this outburst by his wife . He is into cool , you can see . Music , dope . Just on the fringes , but enough to give you the pitch . " He sure can kiss those nigger babies , " Ronnie Harrison comes in with , maybe trying to help . It 's fascinating to Rabbit how long those strands of hair are Ronnie is combing over his bald spot these days , if you pulled one the other way it would go below his ear . In this day and age why fight it ? There 's a bald look , go for it . Blank and pink and curved , like an ass . Everybody loves an ass . Those wax bullets in the yellow box  --  could they have been for Cindy ? Sore there from , but would Webb ? Harry has read somewhere that male homosexuals have a lot of trouble with hemorrhoids . Amazing the things they try to put up  --  fists , light bulbs . He squirms on his cushion . " I think he 's very sexy , " Thelma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enunciated . He looks at her through the enhancing lens of liquor : thin lips and that unhealthy yellowy color . Harry can hardly ever look at her without seeing Ronnie 's prick , flat like a board on the upper side it 's so thick . " He is a beautiful man , " Thelma insists . Her eyes are half-shut . She 's had a glass or two too many herself . Her throat rises absolutely straight , like a person trying not to hiccup . He has to look down the front of her dress , velvet that mousy blue of old movie seats , the way she 's holding herself . Nothing much there . That little stocky guy in white with all those gold buttons and different funny hats , to see him as sexy you 'd have to be a nun . Ronnie is stocky like that , actually . She likes thick men . He looks down the front of her dress again . Maybe more there than you 'd think.  |p288Janice  is saying , she has known Peggy for ages and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked today , I do n't know if you were watching , Peggy , was when he came out on the balcony of that cathedral in Washington , before he went to the White House , to this crowd that was shouting , We want the Pope , we want the Pope , ' and he came out on the balcony waving and shouted , John Paul Two , he wants you ! ' Actually . " " Actually " because the men had laughed , it was news to them . Three of them had been out on the Flying Eagle course today , summer had made one last loop back to Diamond County , bringing out fat buds on the magnolias by the sixth tee . Their fourth had been the young assistant pro , the same kid who had shot a 73 the day Nelson got married . He hits a long ball , Webb was right , but Harry does n't like his swing : too wristy . Give him a few years around his waist he 'll be hooking everything . Buddy Inglefinger had been dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives did n't like his tarty girlfriends . But 011ie Fosnacht is no substitute . The only thing he plays is the synthesizer , and his sloppy wife wo n't stop blabbering . " I 'd like to find it amusing , " Peggy says , hoisting her voice above the laughter , " but to me the issues he 's trampling on are too damn serious . " Cindy Murkett unexpectedly speaks . " He 's been a priest in a Communist country ; he 's used to taking a stand . The American liberals in the church talk about this sensus fidelium but I never heard of it ; it 's been magisterium for two thousand years . What is it that offends you , Peggy , if you 're not a Catholic and do n't have to listen ? " A hush has surrounded her words because they all except the Fosnachts know that she was Catholic until she married Webb . Peggy senses this now but like a white sad heifer having charged in one direction can not turn herself around . " You 're Catholic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not used to this kind of spotlight , the baby of their group . " I was raised as one , " she says.  | " So was my daughter-in-law , it turns out , " Harry volunteers . He is amused by the idea of his having a daughter-in-law at all , a new branch of his wealth . And he hopes to be distracting . He hates to see women fight , he 'd be happy to get these two off the spot . Cindy comes up from that swimming pool like a wet dream , and Peggy was kind enough to lay him when he was down . But no one is distracted . " When I married a divorced man , " Cindy explains levelly to the other woman , " I could n't take communion anymore . But I still go to Mass sometimes . I still believe . " Her voice softens saying this , for she is the hostess , younger though she is . " And do you use birth control ? " Peggy asks . Back to nowhere , Fosnachts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd the way it was . Cindy hesitates . She can go all girlish and slide and giggle away from the question , or she can sit still and get dignified . With just the smallest of dignified smiles she says , " I 'm not sure that 's any of your business . " " Nor the Pope 's either , that 's my point ! " Peggy sounds triumphant , but even she must be feeling the battle slipping away . She will not be invited here again . Webb , always the gentleman , perches on the arm of the easy chair in which cumbersome Peggy has set herself up as antiPopeand leans down a deft inch to say to his guest alone , " I think Cindy 's point , as I understand it , is that John Paul is addressing the doctrinal issues for his fellow Catholics while bringing good will to every American . " " He can keep his good will along with the doctrine as far as I 'm concerned , " Peggy says , trying to shut up but unable . Rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad her having gotten good at screwing since 011ie left her had seemed to him at the time , ten years ago . Cindy attacks a little now , " But he sees the trouble the church has got into since Vatican Two . The priests  --  " " The church is in trouble because it 's a monument to a lie ,  |p290run  by a bunch of antiquated chauvinists who do n't know anything . I 'm sorry , " Peggy says , " I 'm talking too much . " " Well , this is America , " Harry says , coming to her rescue , somewhat , " Let 's all sock it to each other . Today I said goodbye to the only friend I 've ever had , Charlie Stavros . " Janice says , " Oh , Harry , " but nobody else takes him up on it . The men were supposed to say they were his friends . Webb Murkett tilts his head , his eyebrows working toward Ronnie and 011ie . " Did either of you see in the paper today where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to David Rockefeller . I 'm no great admirer of tricky Dick 's , but I must say the way he 's been excluded from apartment houses in a great city is a disgrace to the Constitution . " " If he 'd been a jigaboo , " Ronnie begins . " Well how would you like , " Peggy Fosnacht has to say , " a lot of secret service men checking your handbag every time you came back from the store ? " The chair Peggy sits in is squared-off ponderous modern with a pale fabric thick as plywood ; it matches another chair and a long sofa set around that kind of table with no overhang to the top they call a Parsons table , which is put together in alternating blocks of light and dark wood with a curly knotty grain such as they make golf club heads of . The entire deep space of the room , which Webb added on when he and Cindy acquired this house in the pace-setting development of Brewer Heights , gently brims with appointments chosen all to harmonize . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vertical folds of the slightly darker pull drapes , and reproductions of Wyeth watercolors lit by spots on track lighting overhead echo with scratchy strokes the same tints , and the same lighting reveals little sparkles , like mica on a beach , in the overlapping arcs of the rough-plastered ceiling . When Harry moves his head these sparkles in the ceiling change location , wave upon wave of hidden silver . He announces , " I heard a kind of funny story at Rotary the other day involving Kissinger . Webb , I don'tp291think you were there . There were these five guys in an airplane that was about to crash  --  a priest , a hippie , a policeman , somebodyelse , and Henry Kissinger . And only four parachutes . " Ronnie says , " And at the end the hippie turns to the priest and says , Do n't worry , Father . The Smartest Man in the World just jumped out with my knapsack . ' We 've all heard it . Speaking of which , Thel and I were wondering if you 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an Ann Landers column printed in the Brewer Standard , the respectable paper , not the Vat . The second paragraph is marked in tidy ballpoint . " Readit aloud , " Ronnie demands . He does n't like being given orders by sweaty skinheads likeHarrison when he 's come out for a pleasant low-key time withthe Murketts , but all eyes are on him and at least it gets them off the Pope . He explains , more to the Fosnachts than the others , since the Murketts seem to be in on the joke already , " It 's a letter to Ann Landers from somebody . The first paragraph tellsabout a news story about some guy whose pet python bit him in the stomach and would n't let go , and when the paramedics camehe yelled at them to get out of his apartment if they 're going to hurt his snake . " There is a little laughter at that and the Fosnachts , puzzled , try to join in . The next paragraph goes : The other news story was about a Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his putter on the 16th green of a country club . ( The goose honked just as he was about to sink one . ) The reason for printing those letters was to demonstrate that truth is stranger than fiction . Having read this aloud , he explains to the Fosnachts , " The reason they 're razzing me with this is last summer I heard about the same incident on the radio and when I tried to tell them about it at the club they would n't listen , nobody believed me . Now here 's proof it happened . " " You chump , that 's not the point , " Ronnie Harrison says . " The point is , Harry , " Thelma says , " it 's so different . Youp292said he was from Baltimore and this says he was from Washington . You said the ball hit the goose accidentally and the doctor put him out of his misery . " Webb says , " Remember  --  A mercy killing , or murder most foul ? ' That really broke me up . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , pleased however . " According to Ann Landers , then , it was murder most foul , " Thelma says . " Who cares ? " Ronnie says , getting ugly . This clipping was clearly her idea . Her touch on the ballpoint too . Janice has been listening with that glazed dark look she gets when deep enough into the booze . She and Webb have been tryingsome new imported Irish liqueur called Greensleeves . " Well not if the goose honked , " she says. 011ie Fosnacht says , " I ca n't believe a goose honking would make that much difference on a putt . " All the golfers there assure him it would . " Shit , " he says , " in music , you do your best work at two in the morning , stoned half out of your mind and a lot of drunks acting up besides . " His mention of music reminds them all that in the background Webb 's hidden speakers are incessantly performing ; a Hawaiian melody at the moment , with Vibra-Harp . " Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe it was a very little caddy with feathers . " " That 's music , " Ronnie sneers , of 011ie 's observation . " Hey Webb , how come there is n't any beer in this place ? " " There 's beer , there 's beer . Miller Lite and Heineken 's . What can I get everybody ? " Webb acts a little jumpy , and Rabbit worries that the party is in danger of flattening out . He misses , whom he never thought he would , Buddy Inglefinger , and tries to say the kind of thing Buddy would if he were here . " Speaking of dead geese , " he says , " I noticed in the paper the other day where some anthropologist or something says about a fourth of the animal species on earth right now will be extinct by the year 2000. "  | " Oh do n't , " Peggy Fosnacht protests loudly , shaking herself ostentatiously , so the fat on her upper arms jiggles . She is wearing a short-sleeved dress , out of season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of it gives me the creeps . " Nobody asks her why . Rabbit at last says , " Why ? You 'll still be alive . " " No I wo n't , " she says flatly , wanting to make an argument even of that . The heated flush the papal argument roused in Cindy still warms her throat and upper chest , that with its tiny gold cross sits half-exposed by the unbuttoned two top buttons or stringlatchesof the Arab-style robe , her tapering forearms looking childishly fragile within its wide sleeves , her feet bare but for the thinnest golden sandals below the embroidered hem . In the commotion as Webb takes drink orders and Janice wobbles up to go to the john , Harry goes over and sits on a straight chair beside their young hostess . " Hey , " he says , " I think the Pope 's pretty great . He really knows how to use TV . " Cindy says , with a sharp quick shake of her face as if stung , " I do n't like a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the line somewhere . That 's his job . " " He 's running scared , " Rabbit offers . " Like everybody else . " She looks at him , her eyes a bit Chinesey like Mim said , the fatty pouches of her lower lids giving her a kind of squint , as if she 's been beaten or is suffering from ragweed , so she twinkleseven as she 's being serious , her pupils large in this shadowy center of the room away from the track lighting . " Oh , I ca n't think of him that way , though you 're probably right . I 've still too much parochial school in me . " The ring of brown around her pupils is smooth chocolate , without flecks or fire . " Webb 's so gentle , he never pushes me . After Betsey was born , and we agreed he 's been father enough , Webb , I could n't make myself use a diaphragm , it seemed so evil , and he did n't want me on the Pill , what he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed , you know , like the men are paid to do in India , what do they call it , a vasectomy . Rather than have him do thatp294and do God knows what to his psyche , I went impulsively one day and got myself fitted for the diaphragm , I still do n't know if I 'm putting it in right when I do it , but poor Webb . You know he had five other children by his other wives , and they 're both after his money constantly . Neither has married though they 're living with men , that 's what I would call immoral , to keep bleeding him that way . " This is more than Harry had bargained for . He tries to confess back at her . " Janice had her tubes cauterized the other year , and I must say , it 's great not to have to worry about it , whenever you want it , night or day , no creams or crap or anything . Still , sometimes she starts crying , for no reason . At being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would too . " Cindy 's lips are long and in their lipstick lie together with a wised-up closeness of fit , a downward tug at the end of sentences , he has never noticed before tonight . " But you 're a baby , " he tells her . Cindy gives him a wise slanting look and almost toughly says , " I 'm getting there , Harry . I 'll be thirty this April . " Twenty-nine , she must have been twenty-two when Webb started fucking her , what a sly goat , he pictures her body all brown with its little silken slopes and rolls of slight excess inside the rough loose garment , shadowy spaces you could put your hand in , for the body to breathe in that desert heat , it goes with the gold threads on her feet and the bangles around her wrists , still small and round as a child 's , veinless . The vehemence of his lust dries his mouth . He stands to go after his brandy but loses his balance so his knee knocks against Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is standing at the top of the two steps that lead upward out of the living room , with the out-of-date dull green loden coat she came in draped around her shoulders . She looks down at them like one placed above and beyond , driven away . Ollie , though , is seated around the Parsons table waiting for Webb to bring the beer and oblivious of his wife 's withdrawal.  |p295Ronnie  Harrison , so drunk his lips are wet and the long hair he brushes across his bald spot stands up in a loop , asks 011ie , " How goes the music racket these days ? I hear the guitar craze is over now there 's no more revolution . " " They 're into flutes now , it 's weird . Not just the girls , but guys too , who want to play jazz . A lot of spades . A spade came in the other day wanted to buy a platinum flute for his daughter 's eighteenth birthday , he said he read about some Frenchman who had one . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guess what a flute like that would cost . ' He said , I do n't give a flying fuck , man , ' and showed me this roll of bills , there must have been an inch of hundred-dollar bills in it . At least those on top were hundreds . " Any more feeling-out with Cindy would be too much for now ; Harry sits down heavily on the sofa and joins the male conversation . " Like those gold-headed putters a few years ago . Boy I bet they 've gone up in value . " Like Peggy , he is ignored . Harrison is boring in . These insurance salesmen : they have that way of putting down their heads and just boring in until it 's either scream or say , sure , you 'll take out another fifty thousand of renewable life . Ronnie says to 011ie , " How about electric stuff ? You see this guy on television even has an electric violin . That stuff must cost . " " An arm and a leg , " 011ie says , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light square of the table in front of him . " Just the amplifiers take you into the thousands , " he says , pleased to be talking , pleased to sound rich . Poor sap , when most of his business is selling thirteen-year-old dumplings records to make them wet their pants . What did Nelson used to call it ? Lollipop music . Nelson used to be serious about the guitar , that one he saved from the fire and then the one they got him with a big pearl plate on the face , but the chords stopped coming from his room after school when he got his driver 's license . Ronnie has tilted his head to bore in at a different angle . " You know I 'm in client service at Schuylkill Mutual and myp296boss told me the other day , Ron , you cost this company eight thousand seven hundred last year . ' That 's not salary , that 's benefits . Retirement , health insurance , participation options . How do you handle that in your operation ? If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're in the soup . People expect it and without it they wo n't perform . " 011ie says , " Well , I 'm my own employer in a way . Me and my partners  --  " " How about Keogh ? You got ta have Keogh . " " We try to keep it simple . When we started out  --  " " You got ta be kidding , 011ie . You 're just robbing yourself . Schuylkill Mutual offers a terrific deal on Keogh , and we could plug you in , in fact we advise plugging you in , on the corporate end so not a nickel comes out of your personal pocket , it comes out of the corporate pocket and there 's that much less for Uncle to tax . These poor saps carrying their own premiums with no company input are living in the dark ages . There 's nothing shady about rigging it this way , we 're just using the laws the government has put there . They want people to take advantage , it all works to up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keogh , do n't you ? You 're looking kind of blank . " " It 's something like social security . " " A thousand times better . Social security 's just a rip-off to benefit the freeloaders now ; you 'll never see a penny of what you put in . In the Keogh plan , up to seventy-five hundred goes untaxed , every year ; you just set it aside , with our help . Our usual suggestion is , depending on circumstances  --  how many dependents you got ?  --  " " Two , if you count the wife . My son Billy 's out of college and up in Massachusetts studying specialized dentistry . " Ronnie whistles . " Boy , you were smart . Limiting yourself to one offspring . I saddled myself with three and only these last few years am I feeling out of the woods . The older boy , Alex , has taken to electronics but the middle boy , Georgie , neededp297special schools from the start . Dyslexia . I 'd never heard of it , but I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any goddamsense at all out of anything written , and you 'd never know it from his conversation . He could outtalk me at this job , that 's for certain , but he ca n't see it . He wants to be an artist , Jesus . There 's no money there , 011ie , you know that better than I do . But even with just the one kid , you do n't want him to starve if you were suddenly out of the picture , or the good woman either . Any man in this day and age carrying less than a hundred , a hundred fifty thousand dollars straight life just is n't being realistic . A decent funeral alone costs four , five grand . " " Yeah , well  --  " " Lemme get back to the Keogh a minute . We generally recommenda forty-sixty split , take the forty per cent of seventy-five hundred in straight life premiums , which generally comes to close to the hundred thou , assuming you pass the exam that is . You smoke ? " " Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you the name of a doctor who gives an exam everybody can live with . " Ollie says , " I think my wife wants to go . " " You 're kidding , Foster . " " Fosnacht . " " You 're kidding . This is Saturday night , man . You got a gig or something ? " " No , my wife  --  she needs to go to some anti-nuclear meeting tomorrow morning at some Universalist church . " " No wonder she 's down on the Pope then . I hear the Vatican and Three-Mile Island are hand-in-glove , just ask friend Harry here . 011ie , here 's my card . Could I have one of yours please ? " " Uh  --  " " That 's O.K. I know where you are . Up there next to the fuck movies . I 'll come by . No bullshit , you really owe it to yourself to listen to some of these opportunities . People keep saying the economy is shot but it is n't shot at all from where I sit , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Come on , Ron . 011ie wants to go . " " Well , I do n't exactly but Peggy  --  " " Go . Go in peace , man . " Ronnie stands and makes a hamhandedblessing gesture . " Got pless Ameri-ca , " he pronounces in a thick slow foreign accent , loud , so that Peggy , who has been conferring with the Murketts , patching things up , turns her back . She too went to high school with Ronnie and knows him for the obnoxious jerk he is . " Jesus , Ronnie , " Rabbit says to him when the Fosnachts have gone . " What a snow job . " " Ahh , " Ronnie says . " I wanted to see how much garbage he could eat . " " I 've never been that crazy about him either , " Harry confesses . " He treats old Peggy like dirt . " Janice , who has been consulting with Thelma Harrison about something , God knows what , their lousy children , overhears this and turns and tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why he minds 011ie . " Nothing like a little booze to freshen up old sore points . Ronnie laughs to attract attention and slaps Harry 's knee . " You screwed that big pig , funny eyes and all ? " Rabbit pictures that heavy glass egg with the interior teardrop of air back in Ma Springer 's living room , its smooth heft in his hand , and imagines himself making the pivot from pounding it into Janice 's stubborn dumb face to finishing up with a onehandedstuff straight down into Harrison 's pink brainpan . " It seemed a good idea at the time , " he has to admit , uncrossing his legs and stretching them in preparation for an extended night . The Fosnachts ' leaving is felt as a relief throughout the room . Cindy is tittering to Webb , clings briefly to his coarse gray sweater in her rough loose Arab thing , like a loving pair advertisingvacations abroad . " Janice had run off at the time with this disgusting greasy Greek Charlie Stavros , " Harry explains to anybody who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you do n't need to tell us . We 've all heard the story , it 's ancient history . "  | " What is n't so ancient , you twerpy skinhead , is I had to kiss Charlie goodbye today because Janice and her mother got him canned from Springer Motors . " " Harry likes to say that , " Janice said , " but it was as much Charlie 's idea as anybody 's . " Ronnie is not so potted he misses the point . He tips his head and looks at Janice with a gaze that from Harry 's angle is mostly furry white eyelashes . " You got your old boyfriend fired ? " he asks her . Harry amplifies , " All so my shiftless son who wo n't even finish college with only one year to go can take over this job he 's no more qualified for than , than  --  " " Than Harry was , " Janice finishes for him  --  in the old days she would never have been quick with sass like that  --  and giggles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His cock is n't the only thick thing about Harrison . " This is what I like , " Webb Murkett says in his gravelly voice above them . " Old friends . " He and Cindy side by side stand presiding above their circle as the hour settles toward midnight . " What can I get anybody ? More beer ? How about a light highball ? Scotch ? Irish ? A CC and seven ? " Cindy 's tits jut out in that caftan or burnoose or whatever like the angle of a tent . Desert silence . Crescent moon . Put the camel to bed . " We-ell , " Webb exhales with such pleasure he must be feeling that Greensleeves , " and what did we think of the Fosnachts ? " " They wo n't do , " Thelma says . Harry is startled to hear her speak , she has been so silent . If you close your eyes and pretend you 're blind , Thelma has the nicest voice . He feels melancholy and mellow , now that the invasion from the pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a sap from Day One , " he says , " but she did n't used to be such a blabbermouth . Did she , Janice ? " Janice is cautious , defending her old friend . " She always had a tendency , " she says . " Peggy never thought of herself as attractive , and that was a problem . " " You did , huh ? " Harry accuses.  |p300She  stares at him , having not followed , her face moistened as by a fine spray . " Of course she did , " Webb gallantly intervenes , " Janice is attractive , " and goes around behind her chair and puts his hands on her shoulders , close to her neck so her shoulders hunch . Cindy says , " She was a lot pleasanter just chatting with me and Webb at the door . She said she sometimes just gets carried away . " Ronnie says , " Harry and Janice I guess see a lot of ' em . I 'll have a brew as long as you 're up , Webb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend is their obnoxious son Billy , is how they got to the wedding . Webb , could you make that two ? " Thelma asks Harry , her voice softly pitched for him alone , " How is Nelson ? Have you heard from him in his married state ? " " A postcard . Janice has talked to them on the phone a couple times . She thinks they 're bored . " Janice interrupts , " I do n't think , Harry . He told me they 're bored . " Ronnie offers , " If you 've done all your fucking before marriage , I guess a honeymoon can be a drag . Thanks , Webb . " Janice says , " He said it 's been chilly in the cabin . " " Too lazy no doubt to carry the wood in from the stack outside , " Harry says . " Yeah , thanks . " The p f f f t of opening a can is n't near as satisfying since they put that safety tab on to keep idiots from choking themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a fire in the wood stove all day long . " " Burning it all up so somebody else can chop . He 's his mamma 's boy . " Thelma , tired perhaps of the tone the Angstroms keep setting , lifts her voice and bends her face far back , exposing a startling length of sallow throat . " Speaking of the cold , Webb . Are you and Cindy going away at all this winter ? " They usually gop301to an island in the Caribbean . The Harrisons once went with them , years ago . Harry and Janice have never been . Webb has been circling behind Thelma getting a highball for someone . " We 've talked about it , " he tells Thelma . Through the haze of beer laid over brandy there seems an enchanting conspiracy between her bent-back throat and Webb 's arched and lowered voice . Old friends , Harry thinks . Fit like pieces of a puzzle . Webb bends down and reaches over her shoulder to put a tall weak Scotch-and-soda on a dark square in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going on , " where they have a golf course . You can get a pretty fair deal , if you shop around for a package . " " Let 's all go , " Harry announces . " The kid 's taking over the lot Monday , let 's get the hell out of here . " " Harry , " Janice says , " he 's not taking over the lot , you 're being irrational about this . Webb and Ronnie are shocked , to hear you talk about your son this way . " " They 're not shocked . Their kids are eating ' em alive too . I want to go to the Caribbean and play golf this winter . Let 's bust out . Let 's ask Buddy Inglefinger to be the fourth . I hate the winter around here  --  there 's no snow , you ca n't ice-skate , it 's just boring and raw , month after month . When I was a kid , there was snow all the time , what ever happened to it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Webb observes . " Harry , maybe it 's time to go home , " Janice tells him . Her mouth has thinned to a slot , her forehead under her bangs is shiny . " I do n't want to go home . I want to go to the Caribbean . Butfirst I want to go to the bathroom . Bathroom , home , Caribbean , in that order . " He wonders if a wife like that ever dies of naturalcauses . Never , those dark wiry types , look at her mother , stillrunning the show . Buried poor old Fred and never looked back . Cindy says , " Harry , the downstairs john is plugged , Webbjust noticed . Somebody must have used too much toilet paper . " " Peggy Gring , that 's who , " Harry says , standing and wondering why the wall-to-wall carpeting has a curve to it , like thep302deck of a ship falling away on all sides . " First she attacks the Pope , then she abuses the plumbing . " " Use the one in our bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the stairs , turn left , past the two closet doors with the slats . " " . . . wiping away her tears . . . , " Rabbit hears Thelma Harrison saying dryly as he leaves . Up the two carpeted steps , his head floating far above his feet . Then down a hall and up stairs in different-colored carpeting , a dirty lime , more wear , older part of the house . Someone else 's upstairs always has that hush . Tired nights , a couple talking softly to themselves . The voices below him fade . Turn left , Webb had said . Slatted doors . He stops and peeks in . Female clothes , strips of many colors , fragrant of her . Get Cindy down there in that sand , who can say , talking to him about her diaphragm already . He finds the bathroom . Every light in it is lit . What a waste of energy . Going down with all her lights blazing the great ship America . This bathroom is smaller than the one downstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shag carpeting and towels and tinted porcelain all brown , with touches of tangerine . He undoes his fly and in a stream of bliss fills one of this room 's bright bowls with gold . His bubbles multiply like coins . He and Janice took their Krugerrands from the bedside table drawer and together went downtown and into the Brewer Trust with them and nestled them in their little cylinders like bluetinteddollhouse toilets into their stout long safe-deposit box and in celebration had drinks with their lunch at the Crepe House before he went back to the lot . Because he was never circumcised he tends to retain a drop or two , and pats his tip with a piece of lemon-yellow toilet paper , plain , the comic strips were to amuse guests . Who was Thelma saying would wipe away her tears ? The shocking flash of long white throat , muscular , the swallowingmuscles developed , she must have something , to hold Harrison . Maybe she meant Peggy using toilet paper to wipe away her tears had clogged the toilet . Cindy 's eyes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with poor Peggy , telling himp303instead about her diaphragm , Jesus , inviting him to think about it , her sweet red dark deep , could she mean it ? Getting there , Harry : her voice more wised-up and throaty than he ever noticed before , her eyes pouchy , sexy when women 's lower lids are like that , up a little like eggcups , his daughter 's lids he noticed that day did that . All around in here are surfaces that have seen Cindy stark naked . Harry looks at his face in this less dazzling mirror , fluorescent tubes on either side , and his lips look less blue , he is sobering up for the drive home . Oh but blue still the spaces in his eyes , encircling the little black dot through which the world flows , a blue with white and gray mixed in from the frost of his ancestors , those beefy blonds in horned helmets pounding to a pulp with clubs the hairy mammoth and the slant-eyed Finns amid snows so pure and widespread their whiteness would have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dead live in us though their brains are black and their eyesockets of bone empty . His pupils enlarge as he leans closer to the mirror , making a shadow , seeking to see if there truly is a soul . That 's what he used to think ophthalmologists were looking at when they pressed that little hot periscope of a flashlight tight against your eye . What they saw , they never told him . He sees nothing but black , out of focus , because his eyes are aging . He washes his hands . The faucet is one of those single-handed Lavomaster mixers with a knob on the end of the handle like a clown 's nose or big pimple , he can never remember which way is hot and which cold , what was wrong with the old two faucets that said H and C ? The basin , though , is good , with a wide lip of several ledges to hold soap without its riding off , these little ridges most basins have now do n't hold anything , dinky cheap pseudo-marble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know plumbing suppliers who can still provide the good stuff , even though there 's not much market for it . The curved lavender bar he has right in his hands must have lost its lettering making lather for Cindy 's suntanned skin , suds in her crotch , her hair must be jet black there , her eyebrows are : you shouldp304look at a woman 's eyebrows not the hair on her head for the color of her pussy . This bathroom has not been so cleaned up for guests as the downstairs one , Popular Mechanics on the straw hamper next to the toilet , the towels slung crooked on the plastic towel holders and a touch of damp to them , the Murketts showering just a few hours ago for this party . Harry considers opening this bathroom cabinet as he did the other one but thinking of fingerprints notices the chrome rim and refrains . Nor does he dry his hands , for fear of touching the towel Webb used . He has seen that long yellow body in the Flying Eagle locker room . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't contagious but still . He ca n't return downstairs with wet hands . That shit Harrisonwould make some crack . Ya still got scum on your hands , ya jerkoff . Rabbit stands a moment in the hall , listening to the noise of the party rise , a wordless clatter of voices happy withouthim , the women 's the most distinct , a kind of throbbing in it like the melody you sometimes hear in a ragged engine idling , a song so distinct you expect to hear words . The hall is carpeted here not in lime but in a hushed plum , and he moves to follow its color to the threshold of the Murketts ' bedroom . Here it happens . It hollows out Harry 's stomach , makes him faintly sick , to think what a lucky stiff Webb is . The bed is low in modern style , a kind of tray with sides of reddish wood , and the covers had been pulled up hastily rather than made . Had it just happened ? Just before the showers before the party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the low bed he imagines in afterimage her damp and perfect toes , those sucky little dabtoes whose print he has often spied on the Flying Eagle flagstones , here lifted high to lay her cunt open , their baby dots mingling with the moles on Webb 's back . It hurts , it is n't fair for Webb to be so lucky , not only to have a young wife but no old lady Springer on the other side of the walls . Where do the Murketts put their kids ? Harry twists his head to see a closed white door at the far other end of the plump305carpet . There . Asleep . He is safe . The carpet absorbs his footstepsas , silent as a ghost , he follows its color into the bedroom . A cavernous space , forbidden . Another shadowy presence jars his heart : a man in blue suit trousers and rumpled white shirt with cuffs folded back and a loosened necktie , looking overweightand dangerous , is watching him . Jesus . It is himself , his own full-length reflection in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the grain shows through as through powder . The mirror faces the foot of the bed . Hey . These two . It has n't been just his imagination . They fuck in front of a mirror . Harry rarely sees himself head to toe except when he 's buying a suit at Kroll 's or that little tailor on Pine Street . Even there you stand close in to the three-way mirrors and there 's not this weird surround of space , so he 's meeting himself halfway across the room . He looks mussed and criminal , a burglar too overweight for this line of work . Doubled in the mirror , the calm room holds few traces of the Murketts ' living warmth . No little lacy bits of underwear lying around smelling of Cindy cunt . The curtains are a thick red striped material like a giant clown 's pants ballooning , and they have window shades of that room-darkening kind that he keeps asking Janice to get ; now that the leaves are letting go the light barrels through the copper beech right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making nearly fifty thousand a year and this is how he has to live , he and Janice will never get themselves organized . The far window here with its shade drawn for a nap must overlook the pool and the stand of woods everybody has up here in this development between the houses , but Harry does n't want to get himself that deep into the room , already he 's betraying hospitality . His hands have dried , he should go down . He is standing near a corner of the bed , its mute plane lower than his knees , the satiny peach bedspread tugged smooth in haste , and he impulsively , remembering the condoms he used to keep in a parallel place , steps to the curly maple bedside table and ever so stealthily pulls out the small drawer . It was openp306an inch anyway . No diaphragm , that would be in the bathroom . A ballpoint pen , an unlabelled box of pills , some match folders , a few receipts tossed in , a little yellow memo pad with the roofingcompany logo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clippers , some paper clips and golf tees , and  --  his thumping heart drowns out the mumble of the party beneath his feet . At the back of the drawer are tucked some black-backed Polaroid instant photos . That SX-70 Webb was bragging about . Harry lifts the little stack out delicately , turns it over , and studies the photos one by one . Shit . He should have brought his reading glasses , they 're downstairs in his coat pocket , he must get over pretending he does n't need them . The top photo , flashlit in this same room , on this same satiny bedspread , shows Cindy naked , lying legs spread . Her pubic hair is even darker than he imagined , the shape of it from this angle a kind of T , the upright of the T infolded upon a redness as if sore , the underside of her untanned ass making a pale blob on either side . At arm 's length he holds the glazed picture closer to the bedside light ; his eyes water with the effort to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , out of focus beyond her breasts , which droop more to either side than Harry would have hoped , smiles with nervous indulgence at the camera . Her chin is doubled , looking so sharply down . Her feet look enormous . In the next shot , she has turned over , showing a relaxed pair of buttocks , fish-white with an eyelike widening staring from the crack . For the next couple of photos the camera has switched hands , and old Webb , stringy and sheepish , stands as Harry has often seen him after a shower , except without the hard-on , which he is helping with his hand . Not a great hard-on , pointing to ten o'clock , not even ten but more like a little after nine , but then you ca n't expect a guy over fifty to go for high noon , leave that to the pimply teen-agers : when Rabbit was fourteen in soc sci class , a spot of sun , the shadow of Lotty Bingaman 's armpit as she raised her hand with a pencil in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Webb hasp307length but not much bulk at the base ; still , there he is , game and even with the pot belly and gnarled skinny legs and shit-eating expression somehow debonair , not a hair on his wavy head out of place . The next shots were in the nature of experiments , by natural light , the shades must have all been up , bold to the day : slabby shapes and shelves of flesh interlocked and tipped toward violet by the spectrum of underexposure . Harry deciphers one bulge as Cindy 's cheek , and then the puzzle fits , she is blowing him , that purply stalk is his prick rooted in her stretched lips and the fuzzy foreground is Webb 's chest hair as he takes the picture . In the next one he has improved the angle and light and the focus is perfect on the row of one eye 's black lashes . Beyondthe shiny tan tip of her nose , her fingers , boneless and blue-knuckled , with grubby nails , hold the veined thing in its place , her little finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about flutes ? For the next shot Webb had the idea of using the mirror ; he is standing sideways with the camera squarely where his face ought to be and Cindy 's own dear face impaled , as she kneels naked , on this ten-o'clock hook of his . Her profile is snub-nosed and her nipples jut out stiff . The old bastard 's tricks have turned the little bitch on . But her head seems so small and round and brave , stuck on his prick like a candy apple . Harry wants in the next picture to see come like toothpaste all over her face like in the fuck movies , but Webb has turned her around and is fucking her from behind , his prick vanished in the fish-white curve of her ass and his free hand steadying her with his thumb sunk where her asshole would be ; her tits hang down pear-shaped in their weight and her legs next to Webb 's appear stocky . She 's getting there . She will get fatter . She will turn ugly . She is looking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her balance while Webb 's one hand operates the camera , Cindy laughed at that moment a big red laugh like a girl on a poster , with this yellow prick in her from behind . The light in the room must have been dying that day for the flesh of both the Murketts appears goldenp308and the furniture reflected in the mirror is dim in blue shadow as if underwater . This is the last picture ; there were eight and a camera like this takes ten . Consumer Reports had a lot to say a while ago about the SX-70 Land Camera but never did explain what the SX stood for . Now Harry knows . His eyes burn . The party noise below is lessening , perhaps they are listening for a sound from upstairs , wondering what has happened to him . He slips the Polaroids back into the drawer , face down , black backs up , and tries to slide shut the drawer to the exact inch it was open by . The room otherwise is untouched ; the mirror will erase his image instantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aching great erection . He ca n't go downstairs like this : he tries to tear his mind loose from that image of her open mouth laughing at the sight of herself being fucked , who would have thought sweet Cindy could be so dirty ? It takes some doing to realize that other boys are like you are , that dirty , and then to realize that girls can go right along with it takes more than one lifetime to assimilate . Rabbit tries to fling away that laugh , out of his mind , but it has no more carry to it than a handkerchief . He tries to displace what he has just seen with his other secrets . His daughter . His gold . His son coming down from the Poconos tomorrow to claim his place at the lot . That does it , the thing is wilting . Holding gloomy Nelson firmly in his mind , Harry goes into the bathroom and turns on the faucet as if washing his hands in case somebody down below is listening while he undoes his belt and tucks himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen her laugh that same laugh at poolside , at something he or Buddy Inglefinger or even some joker from outside their group altogether has just said . She 'd go down on anybody . As he descends the stairs his head still feels to be floating on a six-foot string attached to his big shoes . The gang in the long living room has realigned itself in a tighter circle about the Parsons table . There seems to be no place for him . Ronnie Harrison looks up . " My God , whatcha been doin ' , jacking off ? " " I 'm not feeling so great , " Rabbit says , with dignity.  | " Your eyes look red , " Janice says . " Have you been crying again ? " They are too excited by the topic among themselves to tease him long . Cindy does n't even turn around . The nape of her neck is thick and brown , soft and impervious . Treading to them on spongy steps across the endless pale carpeting , he pauses by the fireplace mantel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polaroid snaps propped up , one each of the Murketts ' little children , the five-year-old boy with an outsize fielder 's mitt standing sadly on the bricks of their patio , and the three-year-old girl on this same hazily bright summer afternoon , before the parents took a nap , squinting with an obedient and foolish halfsmileup toward some light-source that dazzles her . Betsey is wearing both pieces of a play-muddied little bikini and Webb 's shadow , arms lifted to his head as if to scare her with horns , fills one corner of the exposed square of film . These are the missing two shots from that pack of ten . " Hey , Harry , how about the second week of January ? " Ronnie hoots at him . They have all been discussing a shared trip to the Caribbean , and the women are as excited about it as the men . It is after one when he and Janice drive home . Brewer Heights is a development of two-acre lots off the highway to Maiden Springs , a good twenty minutes from Mt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developer left trees , and six hours ago when they drove up this road each house was lit in its bower of unbulldozed woods like displays in the facade of a long gray department store . Now the houses , all but the Murketts ' , are dark . Dead leaves swirl in the headlights , pour from the trees in the fall wind as if from bushel baskets . The seasons catch up to you . The sky gets streaky , the trees begin to heave . Harry can think of little to say , intent upon steering on these winding streets called drives and boulevards . The stars flickeringp310through the naked swaying treetops of Brewer Heights yield to the lamp-lit straightaway of the Maiden Springs Pike . Janice drags on a cigarette ; the glow expands in the side of his vision , and falls away . She clears her throat and says , " I suppose I should have stuck up more for Peggy , she being an old friend and all . But she did talk out of turn , I thought . " " Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . I know she keeps thinking of leaving him . " " Are n't you glad we have all that behind us ? " He says it mischievously , to hear her grapple with whether they did or did n't , but she answers simply , " Yes . " He says nothing . His tongue feels trapped . Even now , Webb is undressing Cindy . Or she him . And kneeling . Harry 's tongue seems stuck to the floor of his mouth like those poor kids every winter who insist on touching their tongues to iron railings . Janice tells him , " Your idea of taking this trip in a bunch sure took hold . " " It 'll be fun . " " For you men playing golf . What 'll we do all day ? " " Lie in the sun . There 'll be things . They 'll have tennis courts . " This trip is precious to him , he speaks of it gingerly . Janice drags again . " They keep saying now how sunbathing leads to cancer . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition where she should n't be in the sun at all , it could kill her she 's told me . I 'm surprised she 's so keen on going . " " Maybe she wo n't be in the morning on second thought . I do n't see how Harrison can afford it , with that kid of theirs in defective school . " " Can we I wonder ? Afford it . On top of the gold . " " Honey , of course . The gold 's already gone up more than the trip will cost . We 're so pokey , we should have taken up travellingyears ago . " " You never wanted to go anywhere , with just me. "  | " Of course I did . We were running scared . We had the Poconos to go to . " " I was wondering , it might mean leaving Nelson and Pm just at the time . " " Forget it . The way she hung on to Nelson , she 'll hang on to this baby till the end of January . Till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " And then leaving Nelson at the lot alone with too much responsibility . " " It 's what he wanted , now he 's got it . What can happen ? Jake and Rudy 'll be around . Manny 'll run his end . " Her cigarette glows once more , and then with that clumsy scrabbling motion that always annoys him she stubs it out . He hates having the Corona ashtray dirty , it smells for days even after you 've emptied it . She sighs . " I wish in a way it was just us going , if we must go . " " We do n't know the ropes . Webb does . He 's been there before , I think he 's been going since long before Cindy , with his other wives . " " You ca n't mind Webb , " she admits . " He 's nice . But to tell the truth I could do without the Harrisons . " " I thought you had a soft spot for Ronnie . " " That 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You like him , all that vulgarity . He reminds you of basketballdays . Anyway it 's not just him . Thelma worries me . " " How can she ? She 's a mouse . " " I think she 's very fond of you . " " I never noticed . How can she be ? " Stay off Cindy , he 'll let it all out . He tries to see those photographs again , hair by hair in his mind 's eye , and already they are fading . The way their bodies looked golden at the end , like gods . Janice says with a sudden surprising stiffness , " Well , I do n't know what you think 's going to happen down there but we 're not going to have any funny stuff . We 're too old , Harry . " A pick-up truck with its high beams glaring tailgates him blindingly and then roars around him , kids ' voices jeering.  | " The drunks are out , " he says , to change the subject . " What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asks . He answers primly , " Waiting for something to happen that did n't . " " Oh . Were you sick ? " " Heading toward it , I thought . That brandy . That 's why I switched to beer . " Cindy is so much on his mind he can not understand why Janice fails to mention her , it must be deliberate . All that blowing , Lord . There 's birth control . White gobs of it pumping in , being swallowed ; those little round teeth and the healthy low baby gums that show when she laughs . Webb on front and him from behind , or the other way around , Harry does n't care . Ronnie operating the camera . His prick has reawaked , high noon once more in his life , and the steering wheel as they turn into Central Street caresses its swollen tip through the cloth . Janice should appreciate this : if he can get it up to their room intact . But her mind has wandered far from sex , for as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says aloud , " Poor Nelson . He seemed so young , did n't he , going off with his bride ? " This town they know so well , every curb , every hydrant , where every mailbox is . It gives way before them like a veil , its houses dark , their headlights low . " Yeah , " he agrees . " You sometimes wonder , " he hears himself go on , " how badly you yourself fucked up a kid like that . " " We did what we could , " Janice says , firm again , sounding like her mother . " We 're not God . " " Nobody is , " Rabbit says , scaring himself.  |p313THE  HOSTAGES have been taken . Nelson has been working at Springer Motors for five weeks . Teresa is seven months pregnant and big as a house , a house within a house as she mopes around Mom-mom 's in those maternity slacks with Spandex in front and some old shirts of Dad 's he let her have . When she walks down the upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when she tries to help in the kitchen she drops a dish . Because there are five of them now they have had to dip into the good china Mom-mom keeps in the breakfrontand the dish Pru dropped was a good one . Though Mommomdoes n't say much you can see by the way her throat gets mottled it 's a deal for her , the kind of thing that is a big deal for old ladies , going on about those dishes that she and Fred bought fifty years ago together at Kroll 's when the trolley cars ran all up and down Weiser every seven minutes and Brewer was a hot shit kind of place . What Nelson ca n't stand about Pru , she farts . And lying on her back in bed because she ca n't sleep on her stomach , she snores . A light but raspy little rhythmic noise he ca n't ignore ,  |p314lying  there in the front room with the streetlights eating away at the windowshades and the cars going by on the street below , free . He misses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wonders if Pru has what they call a deviated septum . Until he married her , he did n't notice that her nostrils are n't exactly the same size : one is more tear-drop-shaped than the other , as if her thin pointy nose with its freckles had been given a sideways tweak when it was still soft back there in Akron . And then she keeps wanting to go to bed early at just the hour after dinner when the traffic outside picks up and he is dying to go out , over to the Laid-Back for a brew or two or even just down to the Superette on Route 422 to check out some new faces after the claustrophobia of hanging around the lot all day trying to deal around Dad and then coming home and having to deal around him some more , his big head grazing the ceiling and his silly lazy voice laying down the law on everything , if you listen , putting Nelson down , looking at him so nervously , with that sad-eyed little laugh , Did I say that ? , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with Dad is he 's lived in a harem too long , Mom and Mom-mom doing everything for him . Any other man around except Charlie who was dying in front of your eyes and those goons he plays golf with , he gets nasty . Nobody except Nelson in the world seems to realize how nasty Harry C. Angstrom is and the pressure of it sometimes makes Nelson want to scream , his father comes into the room all big and fuzzy and sly when he 's a killer , a body-count of two to his credit and his own son next if he can figure out how to do it without looking bad . Dad does n't like to look bad anymore , that was one thing about him in the old days you could admire , that he did n't care that much how he looked from the outside , what the neighbors thought when he took Skeeter in for instance , he had this crazy dim faith in himself left over from basketball or growing up as everybody 's pet or whatever so he could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone , leaving a big dead man on Nelson 's chest . He tries to explain it to Pru and she listens but she does n't understand.  |p315At  Kent she was slender and erect and quick in her way of walking , her terrific long carrotty hair up in a sleek twist when it was n't let flat down her back looking ironed . Going to meet her up at the new part of Rockwell around five , a student out of water , he would feel enlarged to be taking this working woman a year older than he away from the typewriters and files and cool bright light ; the administration offices seemed a piece of the sky of the world 's real business that hung above the tunnels of the classes he wormed through every day . Pru had none of that false savvy , she knew none of the names to drop , the fancy dead , and could talk only about what was alive now , movies and records and what was on TV and the scandals day to day at work , who burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the other secretaries at work was fucking the man she worked for without much liking him but out of a kind of flip indifference to her own life and body and it thrilled Nelson to think how that could be Pru just as well , there was a tightness to lives in Pennsylvania that loosened out here and let people drift where they would . It thrilled him how casually tough she was , with that who-cares ? way of walkingbeside him , smelling of perfume , and a softer scent attached to her clothes , beneath all those trees they kept bragging about at Kent , that and all those gyms in the Student Center Complex and having the biggest campus bus system in the world , all that bullshit heaped on to try to make people forget the only claim to fame Kent State would ever have , which was May 4 , 1970 , when the Guardsmen fired from Blanket Hill . As far as Nelson was concerned they could have shot all those jerks . When in ' 77 there was all that fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know Pru then . At one of the bars along Water Street she would get into the third White Russian and tell him horror stories of her own growing up , beatings and rages and unexplained long absences on her father 's part and then the tangled doings of her sisters as they matured sexually and began to kick the house down . His tales seemed pale in comparison . Pru made him feel better about being himself . With so manyp316of the students he knew , including Melanie , he felt mocked , outsmarted by them at some game he did n't want to play , but with Pru Lubell , this secretary , he did not feel mocked . They agreed about things , basic things . They knew that at bottom the world was brutal , no father protected you , you were left alone in a way not appreciated by these kids horsing around on jock teams or playing at being radicals or doing the rah-rah thing or their own thing or whatever . That Nelson saw it was all bullshit gave him for Pru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workingman's-type bar in north Akron they used to go to in her car  --  she had a car of her own , a salt-rotted old Plymouth Valiant , its front fender flapping like a flag , and this was another thing he liked about her , her being willing to drive such an ugly old clunker , and having worked for the money to pay for it  --  Nelson could tell he looked pretty good . In terms of the society she knew he was a step up . And so was she , in terms of this environment , the local geography . Not only a car but an apartment , small but all her own , with a stove she cooked her own dinners on , and liquor she would pour for him after putting on a record . From their very first date , not counting the times they were messing around with Melanie and her freaky SLDK friends , Pru had taken him back to her apartmenthouse in this town called Stow , assuming without making any big deal of it that fucking was what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clipped him tight and secure into his own coming . He had fucked other girls before but had n't been sure if they had come . With Pru he was sure . She would cry out and even flip a little , like a fish that flashes to the surface of a gloomy lake . And afterwards cooking him up something to eat she would walk around naked , her hair hanging down her back to about the sixth bump on her spine , even though there were a lot of windows across the apartment courtyardshe could be seen from . Who cares ? She liked being looked at , actually , in the dancing spots they went to some nights , and in private let him look at her from every angle , her big smooth body like that of a doll whose arms and legs and head stayedp317where you set them . His intense gratitude for all this , where another might have casually accepted , added to his value in her eyes until he was locked in , too precious to let go of , ever . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes Mom , Search for Tomorrow on Channel 10 and then Days of Our Lives on 3 and back to 10 for As the World Turns and over to 6 for One Life to Live and then 10 again for The Guiding Light , Nelson knows the routine from all those days before they let him work at the lot . Now Pru farts because of some way the baby is displacing her insides and drops things and says she thinks his father is perfectly nice . He has told her about Becky . He told her about Jill . Pru 's response is , " But that was long ago . " " Not to me . It is to him . He 's forgotten , the silly shit , just to look at him you can see he 's forgotten . He 's forgotten everythinghe ever did to us . The stuff he did to Mom , incredible , and I do n't know the half of it probably . He 's so smug and satisfied , is what gets me . If I could just once make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it go . " " What good would it do , Nelson ? I mean , your father 's not perfect , but who is ? At least he stays home nights , which is more than mine ever did . " " He 's gutless , that 's why he stays home . Do n't you think he would n't like to be out chasing pussy every night ? Just the way he used to look at Melanie . It is n't any great love of Mom that holds him back , I tell you that . It 's the lot . Mom has the whip hand now , no thanks to herself . " " Why , honey . I think from what I 've seen your parents are quite fond of each other . Couples that have stayed together that long , they must have something . " To dip his mind into this possibility disgusts Nelson . The wallpaper , its tangled pattern of things moving in and out of things , looks evil . As a child he was afraid of this front room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mom-mom 's television . Cars passing on Joseph Street , underneath the bare maple limbs , wheel sharp-edged panels around the walls , brightp318shapes rapidly altering like in those computer games that are everywhere now . When a car brakes at the corner , a patch of red shudders across the wallpaper and a pale framed print of a goateed farmer with a wooden bucket at some stone well : this fading print has always hung here . The farmer too had seemed evil to the child 's eyes , a leering devil . Now Nelson can see the figure as merely foolish , sentimental . Still , the taint of malevolenceremains , caught somewhere in the transparency of the glass . The red shudders , and winks away ; a motor guns , and tires dig out . Go : the fury of this unseen car , escaping , becoming a mere buzz in the distance , gratifies Nelson vicariously . He and Pru are lying in the old swaybacked bed he used to share with Melanie . He thinks of Melanie , unpregnant , free , having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses in Oriental religion . Pru is dead sleepy , lying there in an old shirt of Dad 's buttoned at the breasts and unbuttoned over her belly . He had offered her some shirts of his , now that he has this job he has had to buy shirts , and she said they were too small and pinched . The room is hot . The furnace is directly under it and heat rises , there 's nothing they can do about it , here it is the middle of November and they still sleep under a sheet . He is wide awake and will be for hours , agitated by his day . Those friends of Billy 's are after him to buy some more convertibles and though the Olds Delta 88 Royale did sell for $3600 to that doctor Dad says and says Manny backs him up on this that by the time you figure in the deductible on the insurance and the carrying costs there really was n't any profit . And now the Mercury is in the shop though the insurance man wanted to declare it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual antique like this , parts at a premium and the front end screwed up like somebody had done it deliberately , Manny estimates that the repair costs are going to come in four to five hundred above the settlement check , they ca n't give you more than car book value , and when he asked Manny if some of the mechanics could n't do it in their spare time he said , looking sop319solemn , his brow all furrowed and the black pores in his nose jumping out at you , Kid , there is no spare time , these men come in here for their bread and butter , implying he did n't , a rich man 's son . Not that Dad backs him up in any of this , he takes the attitude the kid 's being taught a lesson , and enjoys it . The only lesson Nelson 's being taught is that everybody is out for their own little pile of dollars and nobody can look up to have any vision . He 'll show them when he sells that Mercury for forty-five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LaidBackmoney like that is nothing to . This Iranian thing is going to scare gas prices even higher but it 'll blow over , they wo n't dare keep them long , the hostages . Dad keeps telling him how it costs three to five dollars a day every day to carry a car in inventory but he ca n't see why , if it 's just sitting there on a lot you already own , the company even pays rent to itself , he 's discovered , to gyp the government . Pru beside him starts to snore , her head propped up on two pillows , her belly shiny like one of those puffballs you find in the woods attached to a rotten stump . Downstairs Mom and Dad are laughing about something , they 've been high as kites lately , worse than kids , going out a lot more with that crummy crowd of theirs , at least kids have the excuse there is n't much else to do . He thinks of those hostages in Tehran and it 's like a pill caught in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always pushing on him , when it wo n't go down or come up . Take a single big black helicopter in there on a moonless night , commandos with blackened faces , a little piano wire around the throats of those freaky radical Arabs , uuglh , arg , you 'd have to whisper , women and children first , and lift them all away . Drop a little tactical A-bomb on a minaret as a calling card . Or else a tunnel or some sort of boring machine like James Bond would have . That fantastic scene in Moonraker when he 's dumped from the plane without a parachute and free-falls into one of the bad guys and steals his , ca n't be much worse than hang gliding . By the moonlight Pru 's belly-button is casting a tiny shadow , it'sp320been popped like inside out , he never knew a pregnant woman naked before , he had no idea it was that bad . Like a cannonball , that hit from behind and stuck . Once in a while they get out . They have friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Laid-Back still gathers , guys and these scumbags from around Brewer still hanging around , with jobs in the new electronics plants or some government boondoggle or what 's left of the downtown stores ; you go into Kroll 's these days , where Mom met Dad in prehistoricdays , you go in through that forest where Weiser Square used to be and it 's like the deserted deck of a battleship just after the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor , a few scared salesladies standing around cut off at the waist by the On Sale tables . Mom used to work at the salted nut and candy section but they do n't have one anymore , probably figured out after thirty years and six people died of worms it was n't sanitary . But if there had n't been a nut counter Nelson would n't exist , or would exist as somebody else , which does n't make sense . He and Pru do n't know all their friends ' first names , they have first names like Cayce and Pam and Jason and Scott and Dody and Lyle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Laid-Back enough you get asked along to some of their parties . They live in places like those new condos with stained rough-planking walls and steep-pitched roofs like a row of ski lodges thrown up on the side of Mt . Pemaquid out near the Flying Eagle , or like those city mansions of brick and slate with lots of ironwork and chimneys that the old mill money built along the north end of Youngquist or out beyond the car yards and now are broken up into apartments , where they have n't been made into nursing homes or office buildings for cutesy outfits like handcraftedleathershops and do-it-yourself framers and young architects specializing in solar panels and energy saving and young lawyers with fluffy hair and bandit mustaches along with their business suits , that charge their young clients a flat fee of three hundred dollars whether it 's for a divorce or beating a possession rap . In these neighborhoods health-food stores have sprung up , andp321little long restaurants in half-basements serving vegetarian or macrobiotic or Israeli cuisine , and bookstores with names like Karma Paperbacks , and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indian silk and those drifter hats that make everybody look like the part of his head with the brain in it has been cut off . Old machine shops with cinder-block sides now sell pieces of unpainted furniture you put together yourselves , for these apartments where everybody shares . The apartment Slim shares with Jason and Pam is on the third floor of a tall old house on the high side of Locust , blocks beyond the high school , in the direction of Maiden Springs . A big bay of three four-paned windows overlooks the deadened heart of the city : where once the neon outlines of a boot , a peanut , a top hat , and a great sunflower formed a garland of advertisement above Weiser Square now only the Brewer Trust 's beacons trained on its own granite facade mark the center of the downtown , four great pillars like four white fingers stuck in a rich black pie , the dark patch made by the planted trees of the so-called shopping mall . From this downtown the standard sodium-yellow lamps of the city streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and on into suburbs whose glow flattens to a horizon swallowed by hills that merge with the clouds of night . Slim 's front bay windows have in their upper panes the stained-glass transom lights , those simplified flowers of pieces of purple and amber and milky green , that are along with pretzels Brewer 's pride . But the old floors of parqueted oak have been covered wall-to-wall with cheap shag carpeting speckled like pimento , and hasty- plasterboard partitionshave divided up the generous original rooms . The high ceilings have been lowered , to save heat , and reconstituted in soft white panels of something like pegboard . Nelson sits on the floor , his head tipped back , a can of beer cold between his ankles ; he has shared two joints with Pru and the little holes in the ceiling are trying to tell him something , an area of them seems sharp and vivid and aggressive , like the blackheads on Manny 's nose the other day , and then this look fades and anotherp322area takes it up , as if a jellyfish of intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall is a large grimacing poster of Ilie Nastase . Slim belongs to a tennis club out next to the Hemmigtown Mall and loves Ilie Nastase . Nastase is beaded with sweat , his legs thick as posts . Hairy , knotty posts . The stereo is playing Donna Summer , something about a telephone , very loud . Out in the center of the room between Nelson and some potted ferns and broad-leaved plants like Mom-mom used to have in that side room off the living room ( he remembers sitting with his father looking at them some day when an awful thing had happened , a thing enormous and hollow under them while the leaves of the plants drank the sunlight as these bigger plants too must do when the sun comes slanting in the tall bay windows ) there is a space and in this space Slim is dancing like a snake on a string with another skinny boy with a short haircut called Lyle . Lyle has a narrow skull with hollows at the back and wears tight jeans and some long-sleeved shirt like a soccer shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is queer and though Nelson is n't supposed to mind that he does . He also minds that there are a couple of slick blacks making it at the party and that one little white girl with that grayish kind of sharp-chinned Polack face from the south side of Brewer took off her shirt while dancing even though she has no tits to speak of and now sits in the kitchen with still bare tits getting herself sick on Southern Comfort and Pepsi . At these parties someone is always in the bathroom being sick or giving themselves a hit or a snort and Nelson minds this too . He does n't mind any of it very much , he 's just tired of being young . There 's so much wasted energy to it . He sees on the ceiling that the jellyfish intensity flitting across the holes is energy such as flows through the binary bits of computers but he ca n't take it any further than that . At Kent he was curious about computer science but in just the introductory course Math 10061 in Merrill Hall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Jewish kids and Koreans with faces flat as platters just breezing along like it was plain as day , what a function was , it did n't seem to be anythingp323you could actually point to , just the general idea somehow of the equation , another jellyfish , but how to extract it out ? It beat him . So he figured he might as well come home and share the wealth . His father was holding him on his lap that day , the sensation of a big warm sad-smelling body all around and under his has stayed with him along with a memory of a beam of sunlight eating into the crescent edge of a furry leaf in that iron table of green plants , it must have been around when Becky died . Mom-mom ca n't last forever and when she kicks the bucket that leaves him and Mom in charge of the lot , with Dad up front like one of those life-size cardboard cutouts you used to see in car showrooms before cardboard became too expensive . Those blacks mooching around so superior , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to outstare them , not taking responsibility for anything though , makes him itch with fury , though the joints should be working him around toward mellow by now . Maybe another beer . Then he remembers the beer between his knees , it 's cold and heavy because it 's full and fresh from Slim 's fridge , and takes a sip . Nelson studies his hand carefully because it feels holding the can as though he has a mitten on . Why does n't Dad just die ? People that age get diseases . Then he and Mom . He knows he can manage Mom . He 's not that young , he 's turned twenty-three , and what makes him feel foolish among these people , he 's married . Nobodyelse here looks married . There is sure nobody else pregnant , that it shows . It makes him feel put on display , as a guy who did n't know better . To be fair to her Pru did n't want to come out , she was willing to sit over there like one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching The Love Boat and then Fantasy Island with poor old Mommom , she 's been fading lately , Dad and Mom used to sit home with her but now like tonight they 're out somewhere with that Flying Eagle crowd , incredible how irresponsible grownups so-called get when they think they 're ahead of the game , Mom has told him all about their crazy gold , maybe he should havep324offered to stay home , him and Pru with Mom-mom , she 's the one with all the cards after all , but by that time Pru had gotten herself dolled up thinking she owed Nelson a little social life because he was working so hard and always housebound with her  --  families , doing everything for each other out of imagined obligation and always getting in each other 's way , what a tangle . Then once Pru got here and got a buzz on , the madwoman of Akron took over , she decided to play to the hilt the token pregnantwoman , throwing her weight around , dancing in shoes she really should n't even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic strapping like that gimp the playground supervisors at the Mt . Judge Rec Field used to have you braid lanyards for a whistle out of , there was even he remembers a way of weaving called butterflies , you could make a keyholder this way as if kids ever had keys to hold . Maybe she 's doing it out of spite . But he has undergone an abandonmentof his own and enjoys watching her from a distance of his own , through the smoke . She has flash , Pru , flash and glitter in this electric-green beltless dress she bought herself at a new shop over on Locust where the old retired people are being forced out by gentrification , the middle class returning to the cities . Sleeves wide as wings lift when she whirls and that cannonball of a stomach sticks out tugging up her dress in front to show more of the orange elastic stockings the doctor told her to wear to save her young veins . Her shiny platforms can barely shuffle on the shag carpeting but she leaves them on , showing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body as if skewered through a spot between her shoulder blades writhes to the music while her arms lift green and her fantastic long hair snaps in a circle , again and again . Nelson can not dance , which is to say he will not , for all dancing is now is standing in place and letting the devil of the music enter you , which takes more faith than he 's got . He does n't want to appear a fool . Now Dad , Dad would do it if he were here , just like when Jill was there he gave himself to Skeeter and never looked back even when all the worst hadp325happened , such a fool he really believes there is a God he is the apple of the eye of . The dots on the ceiling do n't let Nelson take this glimpse higher than this and he returns his eyes to Pru , painfully bright in the dazzle dress , its flow like a jewel turned liquid , her face asleep in the music above her belly , which is solid and not hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hates for a second that in himself which can not do it , just as he could not join in the flickering mind play of computer science and college generally and could not be the floating easy athlete his father had been . The dark second passes , dissolved by the certainty that some day he will have his revenge on them all . Pru 's partner for some of the dancing has been one of the sassy Brewer blacks , the bigger one , in bib overalls and cowboy boots , and then Slim comes out of a twirl over by the potted plants with Lyle and swings into orbit with Pru , who keeps at it whether or not anybody is there , up and down , little flips of her hands , and a head toss . Her face does look asleep . That hooked nose of hers sharp in profile . People keep touching her belly , as if for luck : in spinning and snapping their fingers their loose fingers trail across the sacred bulge where something that belongs to him too is lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect her and keep her clean ? She is too big , he would look like a fool , she likes the dirt , she came out of it . Once she drove him past her old home in Akron , she never took him in , what a sad row , houses with wooden porches with old refrigerators on them . Melanie would have been better , her brother played polo . At least Pru should take off her shoes . He sees himself rising up to tell her but in truth feels too stoned to move , obliged to sit here and mellow between the fluffy worms of the carpet and the worm holes of the ceiling . The music has gas bubbles in it , popping in the speakers , and Donna Summer 's zombie voice slides in and out of itself , doubling , taking all parts . Stuck on you , stuck like glue . The fairy that Slim stopped dancing with offers Pru a toke and she sucks the wet tip of the joint and holds it down deep without losing a beat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees that to an Akron slump326kid like this Brewer is a city of hicks and she 's showing them all something . A girl he noticed before , she came here with some big redfacedclod who actually wore a coat and tie to this brawl , comes and sits in the floor beside Nelson under Ilie Nastase and takes the beer from between his ankles to sip from it . Her smiling pale round face looks a little lost here but willing to please . " Where do you live ? " she asks , as if picking up with him a conversation begun with someone else . " In Mt . Judge ? " He thinks that 's the answer . " In an apartment ? " " With my parents and my grandmother . " " Why is that ? " Her face shines amiably with sweat . She has been drinking too . But there is a calm about her he is grateful for . Her legs stretch out beside his in white pants that look radiant where that jellyfish of strangeness moves across them . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought no point in looking for a place until the baby comes . " " You have a wife ? " " There she is . " He gestures toward Pru . The girl drinks her in . " She 's terrific . " " You could say that . " " What does that tone of voice mean ? " " It means she 's bugging the shit out of me . " " Should she be bouncing like that ? I mean , the baby . " " Well , they say exercise . Where do you live ? " " Not far . On Youngquist . Our apartment is n't near as grand as this , we 're on the first floor back , overlooking a little yard where all the cats come . They say our building might be going condo . " " That good or bad ? " " Good if you have the money , bad if you do n't I guess . We just started working in town and my  --  my man wants to go to college when we get our stake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to college and it 's absolutep327horse poop . " She has a pleasant puffy look to her upper lip and he 's sorry to see , from the way she holds her mouth , that he 's left her nothing to say . " What do you work at ? " he asks her . " I 'm a nurses ' aide in an old people 's home . I doubt if you know it , Sunnyside out toward the old fairgrounds . " " Is n't it depressing ? " " People say that but I do n't mind it . They talk to me , that 's mostly what people want , company . " " You and this man are n't married ? " " Not yet . He wants to get further along in life . I think it 's good . We might want to change our minds . " " Smart . That chick in green out there got herself knocked up and I had no choice . " Not much answer to this either . Yet the girl does n't show boredom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot he watches Jake and Rudy prattle away and he envies how they do it without feeling idiotic . This strange face hangs opposite his calmly , mildly attentive , the eyes a blue paler than you almost ever see and her skin milky and her nose slightly tipped up and her gingery hair loosely bundled to the back . Her ears are exposed and pierced but unadorned . In his stoned conditionthe squarish white folds of these ears seem very vivid . " You say you just moved to town , " Nelson says . " Where 'd you move from ? " " Near Galilee . Know where that is ? " " More or less . When I was a kid we went down there to the drag race strip a couple times . " " You can hear the engines from our place , on a quiet night . My room is on the side and I used to always hear them . " " Where we live there 's always traffic going by . My room used to be out in back but now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , though nothing else about her is small , especially . Her thighs really fill those bright white pants . " What does your father do , he a farmer ? " " My father 's dead . " " Oh . Sorry . "  | " No , it was hard , but he was getting along . He was a farmer , you 're right , and he had the school bus contract for the town-ship . " " Still , that 's too bad . " " I have a wonderful mother though . " " What 's wonderful about her ? " In his stupidity he keeps sounding combative . But she does n't seem to mind . " Oh . She 's just very understanding . And can be very funny . I have these two brothers  --  " " You do ? " " Yes , and she 's never tried to make me feel I should back down or anything because I 'm a girl . " " Well why would she ? " He feels jealous . " Some mothers would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says women get more out of life . With men , it 's if you do n't win every time , you 're nothing . " " Some momma . She has it all figured . " " And she 's fatter than I am and I love her for that . " You 're not fat , you 're just nice , he wants to tell her . Instead he says , " Finish up the beer . I 'll get us another . " " No thanks  --  what 's your name ? " " Nelson . " He should ask her hers but the words stick . " Nelson . No thanks , I just wanted a sip . I should go see what Jamie 's doing . He 's in the kitchen with some girl  --  " " Who 's showing her tits . " " That 's right . " " My theory on that is , those that got real tits to show do n't . " He glances down . The vertical ribs of her russet knit sweater are pushed slightly apart as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white cloth of her slacks , taut in wrinkles where belly meets thighs in a triangle , has a radiance that manifeststhe diagonal run of the threads , the way the cloth was woven and cut . Below that her feet are bare , with a pinkness along the outer edge of each big toe fresh from the pressure of her discarded shoes.  |p329The  girl has been made to blush by this survey of her body . " What do you do since college , Nelson ? " " I just veg out . No , actually , I sell cars . Not your ordinary tacky cars but special old convertibles , that nobody makes anymore . Their value is going to go up and up , it has to . " " Sounds exciting . " " It is . Jesus , the other day in the middle of town I saw this white Thunderbird parked , with red leather seats , the guy still had the top down though it 's getting pretty cold , and I nearly flipped . It looked like a yacht . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Jamie and I just bought a Corolla . It 's in his name but I 'm the one that uses it , there is n't any bus that goes out to the fairgrounds anymore and Jamie has a job he can walk to , in this place that makes bug-killers , you know , those electric grids with a purple light that people put outdoors by their pools or barbecues . " " Sounds groovy . Must be a slack season for him though . " " You 'd think so but it 's not , they 're busy making them for next year , and they ship all over the South . " " Huh . " Maybe they 've had enough of this conversation . He does n't want to hear any more about Jamie 's bug-killers . But the girl keeps going , she 's relaxed with him now , and so young everything is new to her . Nelson guesses she 's three or four years younger than he is . Pru is over a year older , and that irritates him right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these blacks and queers she 's not afraid of . " So I really should put in my half , " she is explaining , " even though he makes twice what I do . His parents and my mother loaned us the down payment equally though I know she could n't afford it . Next year if I can get a part-time job somewhere I want to begin nurse 's training . Those RNs make a fortune doing just what I 'm doing now , except they 're allowed to give injections . " " Jesus , you want to spend your whole life around sick people ? "  | " I like taking care of things . On the farm until my father died there were always animals . I used to shear my own sheep even . " " Huh . " Nelson has always been allergic to animals . " Do you dance , Nelson ? " she asks him . " No . I sit and drink beer and feel sorry for myself . " Pru is bouncing around now with a Puerto Rican or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the shop now . He does n't know what disease they get as kids , but their cheeks have worse than pocks  --  like little hollow cuts all over . " Jamie wo n't dance either . " " Ask one of the fairies . Or just go do it by yourself , somebody'llpick you up . " " I love to dance . Why do you feel sorry for yourself ? " " Oh . . . my father 's a prick . " He does n't know why this popped out of his mouth . Something about the goody-goody way in which the girl speaks of her own parents . But in thinkingof his father , what strikes Nelson about the large bland face that appears to his inner eye is a mournful helplessness . His father 's face bloats like an out-of-focus close-up in some war movie in the scramble of battle before floating away . Big and white and vague as on that day when he held him on his lap , when the world was too much for the two of them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stands . Luminous long legs . Her thighs make a kind of lap even when she stands . Her pink-rimmed bare feet sunk in the shag rug so close nearly kill him , they are so sexy . What did she say that for ? Making him feel guilty and scolded . Her own father is dead . She makes him feel he 's killed his . She can go fuck . She goes and dances , standing shy along the wall for a minute and then moving in , loosening . He does n't want to watch and get envious ; he heaves himself up , to get another beer and steal another look at the girl in the kitchen . Sad , tits by themselves , on a woman sitting up . Little half-filled purses . Jamie 's face and hands are broad and scraped-looking and he has loosened his tie to let his bull neck breathe . Another girl is reading his palm ; they are all sitting around a little porcelain kitchen table , with spots worn blackp331where place settings were , that Nelson feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of Marlon Brando in the blackleatherget-up of The Wild One . Another shows Alice Cooper with his green eyelids and long fingernails . The refrigerator with its cool shelves of yogurt in paper cups and beer in sharply lettered sixpacks seems an island of decent order amid all this . Nelson is reminded of the lot , its rows of new Toyotas , and his stomach sinks . Sometimes at the lot , standing in the showroom with no customers in sight , he feels return to him from childhoodthat old fear of being in the wrong place , of life being run by rules nobody would share with him . He returns to the big front room with its fake ceiling and thinks that Pru looks ridiculously older than the other dancers : a little frizzy-haired girl called Dody Weinstein interning in teen fashions at Kroll 's and Slim and this Lyle in the soccer shirt back together again and Pam their hostess in a big floppy muu-muu her body is having fits within , while the wan lights of Brewer fall away beyond the bay window , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be picked up while she stands to one side shivering from side to side in time to the music . One night in a lifetime , one life in a night . She looks a little self-conscious but happy to be here , out of the sticks . The black bubbles in the speakers pop faster and faster , and his wife with her cannonball gut is about to fall flat on her face . He goes to Pru and pulls her by her wrist away . Her spic thug of a partner dead-pan writhes to the girl in white pants and picks her up . Babe it 's got ta be tonight , babe it 's got ta be tonight . Nelson is squeezing Pru 's wrist to hurt . She is unsteady , pulled out of the music , and this further angers him , his wife getting tipsy . Defective equipmentbreaking down on purpose just to show him up . Her brittle imbalance makes him want to smash her completely . " You 're hurting me , " she says . Her voice arrives , tiny and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear . As she tries to pull her wrist away her bangles pinch his fingers , and this is infuriating . He wants to get her somewhere out of this . He pulls herp332across a hallway looking for a wall to prop her up against . He finds one , in a small side room ; the light-switch plate beside her shoulder has been painted like an open-mouthed face with an off-on tongue . He puts his own face up against Pru 's and hisses , " Listen . You shape up for Chrissake . You 're going to hurt yourself if you do n't shape up . And the baby . What 're you tryin ' to do , shake him loose ? Now you calm down . " " I am calm . You 're the one that 's not calm , Nelson . " Their eyes are so close her eyes threaten to swallow his with their blurred green . " And who says it 's going to be a him ? " Pru gives him her lopsided smirk . Her lips are painted vampire red in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizes her hatchet face , her dead calm bloodless look . That blank defiance of the poor : you ca n't scare them enough . He pleads , " You should n't be drinking and smoking pot at all , you 'll cause genetic damage . You know that . " She forms her words in response slowly . " Nelson . You do n't give a shit about genetic damage . " " You silly bitch . I do . Of course I do . It 's my kid . Or is it ? You Akron kids 'll fuck anybody . " They are in a strange room . Flamingos surround them . Whoeverlives in this side room with its view of the brick wall across two narrow sideyards , initially intended for a servant probably , has collected flamingos as a kind of joke . A glossy pink stuffed satin one drapes its ridiculous long black legs over the back of the sofabed , and hollow plastic ones with stick legs are propped along the walls on shelves . There are flamingos worked into ashtraysand coffee mugs and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes and palms and sunsets , souvenirs of Florida . For one souvenir a trio of them were gathered in knickers and Scots caps on a felt putting green . Some of the bigger ones wear on their hollow drooping beaks those limp candylike sunglasses you can get in five and dimes . There are hundreds , others gays must give them to him , it has to be Slim who lives in here , that sofabed would n't be enough for Jason and Pam.  | " It is , " Pru promises . " You know it is . " " I do n't know . You 're acting awfully whorey tonight . " " I did n't want to come , remember ? You 're the one always wants to go out . " He begins to cry : something about Pru 's face , that toughness out of Akron closed against him , her belly bumping his , that big doll-like body he used to love so much , that she might just as easily have entrusted to another , its clefts , its tufts , and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to her . All their render times , picking her up on the hill and walking under the trees , and the bars along Water Street , and his going ahead and letting her out there in Colorado make such a sucker of him while he stewed in Diamond County , nothing . He is nothing to her like he was nothing to Jill , a brat , a bug to be humored , and look what happened . Love feels riddled through all his body like rot , down clear to his knees spongy as punk . " You 'll do damage to yourself , " he sobs ; tears add their glitter to the green of her dress at the shoulder , yet his own crumpled face hangs as clear in the back of his brain as a face on a TV screen . " You 're strange , " Pru tells him , her voice breathier now , a whispery rag stuffed in his ear . " Let 's get out of this creepy place . " " That girl you were talking to , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug-killers . " " You talked together a long time . " " She wanted to dance . " " I could see you pointing and looking at me . You 're ashamed of my being pregnant . " " I 'm not . I 'm proud . " " The fuck you are , Nelson . You 're embarrassed . " " Do n't be so hard . Come on , let 's split . " " See , you are embarrassed . That 's all this baby is to you , an embarrassment . " " Please come . What 're you trying to do , make me get down on my knees ? " " Listen , Nelson . I was having a perfectly good time dancingp334and you come out and pull this big macho act . My wrist still hurts . Maybe you broke it . " He tries to lift her wrist to kiss it but she stiffly resists : at times she seems to him , body and soul , a board , flat , with that same abrasive grain . And then the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is not withholding depths within but there are no depths , this is what there is . She gets on a track sometimes and it seems she ca n't stop . His pulling at her wrist again , only to kiss it but she does n't want to see that , has made her altogether mad , her face all pink and pointy and rigid . " You know what you are ? " She tells him , " You 're a little Napoleon . You 're a twerp , Nelson . " " Hey do n't . " The space around her vampire lips is tight and her voice is a dead level engine that wo n't stop . " I did n't really know you . I 've been watching how you act with your family and you 're very spoiled . You 're spoiled and you 're a bully , Nelson . " " Shut up . " He must n't cry again . " I was never spoiled , just the opposite . You do n't know what my family did to me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it never sounded like any big deal . You expect your mother and poor old grandmother to take care of you no matter what you do . You 're horrid about your father when all he wants is to love you , to have a halfway normal son . " " He did n't want me to work at the lot . " " He did n't think you were ready and you were n't . You are n't . You are n't ready to be a father either but that 's my mistake . " " Oh , even you make mistakes . " The green she is wearing is a hateful color , shimmery electric arsenic like a big fat black hooker would wear to get attention on the street . He turns his eyes away and sees over on a bureau top some bendable toy flamingos have been arranged in a copulating position , one on top of the other 's back , and another pair in what he supposes is a blow job , but the droopy beaks spoil the effect . " I make plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I , nobodyp335has ever taught me anything . But I 'll tell you one thing Nelson Angstrom I 'm going to have this baby no matter what you do . You can go to Hell . " " I can , huh ? " " Yes . " She has to weaken it . Her very belly seems to soften against his , nestling . " I do n't want you to but you can . I ca n't stop you and you ca n't stop me , we 're two people even if we did get married . You never wanted to marry me and I should n't have let you , it turns out . " " I did though , I did , " he says , fearful that confessing this will make his face crumple again . " Then stop being a bully . You bullied me to come here and now you 're bullying me to go . I like these people . They have better senses of humor than the people in Ohio . " " Let 's stay then . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sees . A plaster cast of Elvis Presley with votive candles in red cups at its base . An aquarium withoutfish in it but full of Barbie dolls and polyplike plastic things he thinks are called French ticklers . Tacked-up postcards of women in tinsel triangles somersaulting , mooning , holding giant breasts in their silver-gloved hands , postcards from Germanyprinted on those tiny ridges that hold two views , one coy and one obscene , depending on how you move your head . The room all over has the distinctness and variousness of vomit that still holds whole green peas and orange carrot dice from the dinner of an hour ago . He ca n't stop looking . As he moves from one horror to the next Pru slips away , givinghis hand a squeeze that may be apologetic for all they 've said . What have they said ? In the kitchen the girl with bare tits has put on a T-shirt saying ERA , Jamie has taken off his coat and his necktie . Nelson feels very tall , so tall he ca n't hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they all laugh . In a dark bedroom off the kitchen someone is watching the eleven-thirty special report from Iran , time slips by in that rapid spasmodic skid of party time . When Pru returns to him asking to go she is dead pale , a ghost with the lipstick on **26;8744;TOOLONG later I discovered that every word that was spoken in the grotto beneath the mountain was carefully taken down by an agent of the Magadhan secret service . Somehow , Varshakara had managed to cut a narrow channel straight through the soft stone of the mountain to the grotto . Fortunately , Prince Jeta was too important to be arrested while the person of an ambassador from the Great King was sacred . The journey back to Rajagriha was interminable . The dusty road was jammed with people , carts , contingents of soldiers , camels , elephants . Everyone was eager to get back to the city before the sun set and the gates were shut . I must say I could never get used to the way that Indians relieve themselves in public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without observing dozens of men and women squatting cheerfully at the side of the road . Jaina and Buddhist monks are the worst offenders . Since a monk may eat only what he has managed to beg , tainted food is often put into his bowl , sometimes deliberately . Once the food is in the bowl , he is obliged to eat it . As a result of a truly atrocious diet , most monks suffer from every sort of stomach disorder  --  in public view . I saw , perhaps , a dozen Buddhist monks . Each wore castoff rags , and carried a begging bowl . None wore the yellow robes that are today characteristic of the order because , in those days , most dedicated Buddhistsstill lived in the wilderness , remote from temptation . But eventuallythe solitary life proved to be at variance with the order 's need to record and transmit all the sutras , or words , that the Buddha ever spoke . Gradually those men and women who were truly devoted to the Buddha formed communities . Even during my first visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peripatetic than it had been at first . The original disciples had traveled with the Buddha and , except during the rainy season , he was always on the move . During his last years , he tended to move in a circle that started and ended at Shravasti , where he spent the rainy season in a park that had been given to the order by Prince Jeta and not by a Shravasti merchant named Anathapindika , who used to claim that he had paid Prince Jeta an enormous amount of money for the park . Since Prince Jeta was always careful to avoid credit or praise for anything that he did , Anathapindika is now credited with being the Buddha 's most generous patron . I have never known a man quite so noble as Prince Jeta . When the rains stopped , the Buddha would sometimes revisit his Shakya home in the foothills of the Himalayas . Then he would walk south through the republics , visiting such cities as Kushinara and Vaishali . He would then cross the Ganges at the port of Pataliputra and go south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month in a bamboo grove just inside the city wall . He always slept beneath the trees . He preferred to beg for his food in country lanes rather than in the crowded streets of Rajagriha . During the heat of the day he wouldp201meditate beneath a tree , and all sorts of people would come to see him , including King Bimbisara . I should note here that the sight of holy men squatting beneath trees is a common one in India . Many have been known to sit in the same position for years . Rain-drenched , sun-scorched , wind-flayed , they live on whatever food is brought them . Some never speak ; some never stop talking . From Rajagriha , the Buddha would move on to Varanasi . Here he was always received like a conquering hero . Thousands of curious people would accompany him to the deer park where he had first set in motion the wheel of the doctrine . Because of the crowds , he seldom stayed long at the deer park . In the dead of night he would leave Varanasi for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the rains began , he would return to Shravasti . The Buddha was revered by everyone , including those Brahamans who might have regarded him as a threat to their prestige . After all , he belonged to the warrior class . But he was more than a warrior , more than a Brahman . He was the golden one . So the Brahmans feared him because he was like no one else . But then , strictly speaking , he was no one . He had come ; and he had gone . F T E R A J A T A S H A T R Upaid me the dowry , he said , " You must now buy yourself a house . It must not be too large , nor too small . It must be midway between my house and the king 's palace . There must be a central courtyard with a well of purest water . There must also be ten different kinds of flowering bushes . Suspended between two trees , there must be a swing that will allow two people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The sleeping room must have a wide bed with a canopy of Cathay cloth . There should also be a divan next to a window that looks onto a floweringtree . " After itemizing all the things that my house must have , hep202made two great high arches of his brows and asked , " But where is this perfect place to be found ? My dear , we must search . There is not a moment to lose ! " Needless to say , Ajatashatru had already found us our ideal house . In fact , he owned it . So I ended by giving back to my father-in-law half the dowry money in order to buy a pleasant if somewhat dilapidated house in a noisy street . To my surprise , no attempt was made to convert me to devil-worship before the wedding . I was not expected to do anything more than act out the groom 's part in an ancient Aryan ceremony that is not unlike our own . As in Persia , the religious part of the ceremony is performed by the priestly caste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest attention to what they say and do . In the late afternoon I arrived at the long low wooden house of Ajatashatru . At the entrance I was cheered by a large crowd of common people , who commented favorably on my appearance . I was resplendent , if very hot , in a cloth-of-gold shawl and a turban which a servant had taken one hour to wind and adjust . The king 's own barber had outlined my eyes with black and administered lac to my lips . He had then decorated my body with tinted sandalwood paste , transforming my chest into the leaves and branches of a tree whose delicately drawn trunk made its way down my belly to the genitals , which were painted to resemble roots . A glittering serpent circled the calf of each leg . Yes , the barber was a Dravidian and could not resist this pre-Aryan touch . In hot weather , fashionable Indians ofter cover themselves with sandalwoodpaste on the ground that it makes them cool . It does no such thing . One sweats like a horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfume . I was attended by Caraka and the entire embassy . By now , we all dressed as Indians . Weather had triumphed over patriotism . We were greeted at the palace door by Ajatashatru and Varshakara . They were even more gorgeously dressed than I. Varshakara wore Burmese rubies the color of his teeth , while the heir to the throne wore a thousand thousand diamonds , as the Indians would say . Diamonds hung in chains about his neck , covered his fingers , fell in cascades from the lobes of his ears , girdled the huge belly . According to ancient custom , Ajatashatru offered me a silver cup filled with honey and curds . After I had drunk this cloying mixture , I was led into the central courtyard , where a brightly colored tent had been set up . On the far side of the tent was my as yet unseen bride-tobe , with her mother , grandmother , sister , aunts , female attendants . On our side were the men of the royal family , led by King Bitnbisara , who greeted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one the Aryans of far-off Persia and the Aryans of Magadha. "  | " You reflect , Lord , as does the Great King Darius , the true light of the Aryans , and I am happy to be the humble bridge between the twin shining Lords of all the world . " I had prepared this nonsense in advance , and a great deal more that can be safely forgotten . All that mattered was the striking of the proper note , which was to pretend that Persia and Magadha were now united against the federation of republicsand , if necessary , Koshala . Flanked by Bimbisara and Ajatashatru , I entered the tent . Silver hoops blazed . Flowers had been made into a thousand thousand Note , Democritus , that I am now actually thinking in that flowery Indian dialect and then translating my thoughts , such as they are , into stony Greek . The styles of the two languages are entirely unlike , even though many words are similar . Anyway , there were a lot of floral wreaths , and the close air smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathayan rugs . One was remarkably beautiful  --  a blue dragon against a white sky . Later , when Ajatashatru asked his daughter what she most desired , she said the rug . He wept with joy . Nothing , he declared , would make him happier than to see the Gathay dragon rug in the house of his favorite daughter . But we never got the rug . This was the sort of happiness that he tended to deny himself . The tent was divided in two by a rose-colored curtain . On our side of the curtain , Brahmans chanted passages from the Vedic texts . At enormous length , the perfect love that existed between Rama and Sita was recalled . I was amused to note that the nobles did not even pretend to listen . They were too busy examining one another 's costumes and painted skin . Finally the high priest of Magadha lit a fire in a brazier . Then he was joined by three Brahmans . One held a basin of rice ; one held a basin Of ghee ; one held a basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel the tree on my chest losing its leaves . I was sweating the way that Cyrus insisted that each Persian soldier must sweat before he is allowed to eat his one and only meal of the day . From the other side of the rose-colored curtain , we could hear the voices of the ladies as they chanted mantras . Then King Bimbisara whispered something to the high priest . A moment later the curtain was raised , and the ladies of the royal family now faced the men . My first impression was that the headdresses were almost as tall as the ladies themselves . My wife later told me that since some of the headdressestake a day and a night to arrange , the lady who has been so adorned is obliged to sleep on an inclined board in order not to disturb the marvel that has been created for her . Between the old queen and the chief wife of Ajatashatru stood a smallp204pretty girl . She might have been six years old  --  or twenty-six . The reel circle that Indian ladies so delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed simply , as a virgin . For a moment the men stared at the women , and the women pretended not to look at the men . I was pleased to see that the breasts of ' both sexes were covered , a tribute to that original Aryan modesty which has been so effectively undone by the languorous climate of the Gangeticplain . Finally , the high priest bestirred himself . He took a basket of uncookedrice from a servant woman and made seven small piles on a rug . While this was being done , Ajatashatru crossed the dividing line between the men and the women . As he took his daughter by the hand , Varshakara nudged me . " Go to them , " he whispered . I joined father and daughter at the sacred fire . I had already learned my responses ; fortunately , these were few . " Cyrus Spitama , " said Ajatashatru , " Aryan warrior , lord ambassador of the Persian king , take my daughter , Ambalika , and promise that you will observe the Aryan vows , that you will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said that I would do these things as best I could . Then Ajatashatru tied the end of my upper garment to the end of hers . Together Ambalikaand I fed the fire with rice and ghee . I found this part of the ceremony comfortable , since we were with the son of the Wise Lord in a sunless place . Then I took the girl by the hand and led her around and around the fire until someone placed a small millstone in front of Ambalika . She stood on the stone for a moment . I still have no idea what the millstone signified . Uncomfortably knotted together , we took seven steps , making sure that both her foot and mine would rest for an instant on each of the seven heaps of rice . I know what they represented : the seven mothergoddessesof pre-Aryan India . Those ladies are eternal , and everywhere . When we had finished hopping across the dragon rug , the high priest sprinkled us with water which was sufficiently cooling to remind me how hot I was ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consummation of our marriage could not take place until we had slept side by side for three nights . The origin of this strict abstinencewas explained to me at the time but I have forgotten it . We were also obliged , on the first night in our house , to watch together the north star , a reminder to the newlywed Aryan couple that it is from the north that the tribes originally came . . . and to which one day they will return ? I liked Ambalika . I was prepared not to . After all , I have made it a point to expect the worst in life , and the fact that I am occasionally disappointed in my expectations is a source of ( lark solace.  |p205I  t was about midnight when the last of the wedding party left the house . My father-in-law was quite drunk . " My dear , " he sobbed , " these tears are the tears of that unique sorrow which comes from knowing that never , never again in this life will I know such perfect joy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyelashes stung him , producingreal tears of pain . Frowning , he rubbed his eyes with the back of u diamond-sparkling hand . " Oh , my dearest dear , treat well the lotus of my heart , the favorite of my children ! " In a swirl of perfumed robes and bright jewels , the royal family departed , and I was left alone with my first wife. l looked at her , wondering what to say . But I need not have worried . Ambalika had been exquisitely trained in the women 's quarters . She was like a worldly lady who had spent a half-century at court . " I think , " she said , " that after you light the sacred fire , we had better go up to the roof and look at the north star . " Of course . Fire is sacred to us , too , " I added . " Naturally . " Ambalika was never to show the slightest interest in the Vise Lord or Zoroaster . But tales of life at the Persian court intrigued her enormously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been prepared for us by the half-dozen servants who had reported for duty earlier that day . Ostensibly , they were a gift from the old queen . Actually , they were all members of the secret service . How can one tell ? If a Magadhan servant is efficient and obedient , he is a secret agent . Ordinary servants are lazy , dishonest and cheerful . Together we climbed the rickety stairs to the roof . " Termites , " said Ambalika softly . " My lord and master , we 'll have to try to smoke them out . " " How can you tell that there are termites ? " " It 's just one of the things that we are obliged to know , " she said , rather proudly . " Like the sixty-four arts , which I was taught by the old queen , who really does know them . She 's from Koshala , where they still believe that ladies should learn such things . Magadha 's different . Only t he whores are taught the arts here , which is such a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their wives boring and so they lock them up and spend all their days and nights at the halls or in the houses of the whores who are supposed to be perfectly lovely . One of my maids worked for a whore and she told me , You think your palace quarters ; ire beautiful  --  well , wait until you 've seen So-and-so 's house . ' Of course , I 'd have to wait forever because I could never visit such a person . But iiien can . Anyway , I hope that you 'll wait until I 'm quite old before you start visiting such places . " A tent had been pitched on the roof of the house . By the light of a half-moon , we could see the five smooth hills of the old town . " ' There 's the north star . " Ambalika took my hand and together wep206stared at what Anaxagoras thinks is a rock , and I wondered , as I often do , just where it was that we all came from . Where had the Aryans first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or from the great plains of Scythia ? And why did we come south to Greece , to Persia , to India ? And who were the dark-haired people whom we found in the Sumerian and Harappan cities and where did they come from ? Or did they simply spring from the earth , like so many flowers on a lotus whose time it is to bloom ? Democritus wants to know why the lotus is sacred to eastern peoples . This is why . As the lotus makes its way from the mud to the surface of the water , it forms a chain of buds . Once the lotus bud leaves the water for the air , it opens , flowers , dies ; it is then replaced by the next bud of an endless chain . I suspect that if one were to meditate long enough on the lotus , the idea of simultaneous death and rebirth would occur to one . Of course , it may well have been the other way around : a believer in reincarnation decided that the image of the lotus reflected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went inside our roof top tent . I removed my shawl . The tree on my chest had barely survived the rain of my sweat . But Ambalika was fascinated . " That must 've been a lovely tree . " " So it was . Have you a tree ? " " No . " She removed her shawl . Since I did not share her father 's passion for children , I was relieved to find that she was a fully developed woman . Around each small breast , leaves and flowers had been drawn . At her navel , a white-faced bird stretched its red wings beneath the flowering breasts . " This is Garuda , " she said , patting herself . " The sun bird . Vishnu rides him . He brings very good luck , except to serpents . He is the enemy of all serpents . " " Look , " I said , and showed her my serpent-ed legs . Ambalika had a pretty , most natural laugh . " That means you will have to obey our laws or my Garuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three days we must lie together without making love ? " Ambalika nodded . " Three days , yes . But it wo n't seem long . You see , I know all the sixty-four arts . Well , most of them , anyway . I 'll keep you amused . Mind you , I 'm not an expert at any of them . I mean , I 'm not a whore . I play and improvise on the lute . I dance quite well . I sing  --  not so well . I can act in the old plays very well , particularly when I play one of the gods like Indra . I prefer acting the part of a man-god . I can also write down poetry that I make up in my head but I ca n't make it up on the spur of the moment , the way the old queen does , and I do n't really fence with a sword or staff , though I 'm a good archer . I can make artificial flowers so that you 'll think they 're real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p207Ambalika  described the varying degrees of proficiency with which she practiced each of the sixty-four arts . I 've long since forgotten the full list . But I do recall wondering how any man , much less woman , could have been equally adept at all those things that she named , as well as being a sorcerer , a carpenter , a thinker-up of tongue twisters , and a teacher of birds  --  particularly the last . Every Indian lady has at least one screeching , brightly plumaged bird that she has taught to say " Rama " or " Sita . " When I think of India , I think of talking birds  --  of rivers and rain , of a sun like god . Ambalika was as good as her word . She kept me amused and preoccupiedfor three days and three nights , and though we slept side by side in the roof pavilion , I was able to observe the Vedic law . When I told her that Ajatashatru had called her his favorite daughter , she laughed . " I never met him until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the old queen who picked me . I 'm her favorite granddaughter . Was n't the horse sacrifice wonderful ? The old queen was so excited . Now I can die fulfilled , ' she told us afterwards . You know , she 's going to die very soon . The last horoscope was not good . Look ! There 's a shooting star . The gods are having a party . They 're throwing things at one another . Let 's make a wish . " Since I had not yet met Anaxagoras , I could not tell her that what she took to be a handful of pure light was nothing but a chunk of fiery metal on its way to earth . " Does your father have a favorite wife ? " I asked . " No . He likes new ones . Not wives , of course . They cost you far too much money in the long run , and he 's already got three . He might marry another one  --  or even two . But only after he 's king . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sleeps with the elegant whores . Have you ever gone with him to one of their houses ? " " No . When you say he has no money ... " " My sisters and I often talk about dressing up as young men and sneaking into a whore 's house when she 's having a party so that we can see her practice all the arts properly . Or , perhaps , we could go as veiled dancers but , of course , if we were ever caught ... " " I 'll go . Then I 'll tell you what it 's like . " " I do n't think that 's the sort of thing you should say to your very first wife before you 've experienced her . " " But would n't it be much worse to tell her after ? " " True . About my father not having money ... " The child was quick . She had heard me . She had hoped to distract me . When she failed , she was candid but cautious . She touched one ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she frowned and touched her compressed lips with a reddened forefinger . She was an excellent mime . I was being warned not to discuss the subject in our house , even on the roof at midnight . " He is too generous with everyone , " she said in a loud voice.  | " He wants people to be happy . So he gives them too many presents . That 's why he ca n't afford new wives , which makes us all very happy . Because we want him for ourselves . We do n't want to share him . " This little speech was a masterpiece of the twenty-eighth art , which is acting . The next day while we were swinging side by side in the center of the courtyard , she whispered in my ear , " All my father 's money is being used to raise an army to fight the republics . That 's supposed to be a secret but all the women know it . " " Why does n't the king raise the army ? " " The old queen says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse sacrifice he 's the universal monarch . So why should he go to war now ? " I did not tell her that Darius , not Bimbisara , was universal monarch because , from the beginning , I assumed that Ambalika 's first loyalty would be to her family and not to me . Consequently , I took for granted that whatever I told her of a political nature would be reported to her father or Varshakara . " What does the king think of your father 's plans ? " " He does n't know . How could he ? The old queen wo n't tell him , because she 's afraid of my father . I ca n't think why . After all , she 's his mother . " " But the chamberlain would tell him . " " No one knows what the chamberlain tells anyone in secret . " Ambalikasuddenly looked twice her age . " But he does hate the republics . " " So he has told me . " " Yes , everyone knows what he says . " She was ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a sixty-fifth art , would it be diplomacy or conspiracy ? We were interrupted by the arrival of Ambalika 's grandfather Prince Jeta . As this was the third day , he brought us gifts and we entertained him in the main room of the house . Despite the elegance of the furniture and the hangings , it was impossible to disguise the fact that the house would soon collapse from termites and rot . As always , my fatherin-lawhad done well on the transaction . When Ambalika made as if to withdraw , Prince Jeta motioned for her to stay . " After all , how often does a man get to meet one of his grand-daughters ? " Ambalika remained . Prince Jeta turned to me . " You have been invited , officially , to the court of King Pasenadi . " Prince Jeta spoke with none of the urgency that I knew he felt . " The king himself would like to receive you before the rains begin . " " He does me honor . " I made the usual speech , adding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron leaves for Persia . " " That will be at the beginning of next month , Lord Ambassador . " Prince Jeta smiled and I was careful not to acknowledge the slightestp209distress that he should know of the highly secret arrangements made between Varshakara and me . We had set a price for the iron and we had agreed that the iron be exchanged for gold at Taxila . All in all , I was well pleased with my first commercial treaty . I was not pleased that Prince Jeta knew about it . " Since your caravan will go through Shravasti , I had hoped that you might accompany it . " " We 'll be well guarded , too , " said Ambalika , suddenly interested . " You know , there are bands of thieves from one end of Koshala to the other  --  river pirates , too . Even so , I long to see Shravasti . The old queen tells me that there is no more beautiful city in the world . " " I agree with her , " said Prince Jeta . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've only seen the land between the two rivers , as we call our little world . " " Naturally , I shall try to make the trip , " I began . " Oh , say yes ! " Ambalika had a child 's sense of urgency . Everything must be now . Lais has much the same quality . Prince Jeta smiled at his granddaughter . " Your husband will also want to meet the Buddha , about whom you 've heard such terrible things in the women 's quarters . " " That 's not true , Prince Jeta . Many of our ladies admire the Lord Buddha . " Ambalika was suddenly a tactful royal princess . " Do you ? " " I do n't really know . I ca n't say that I like the idea of being blown out like a candle . I think that Mahavira is much more interesting . " " Have you seen and heard Mahavira ? " Prince Jeta was curious . Ambalika nodded . " When I was about six , the lady-in-waiting took me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river road . Mahavira was sitting in the dirt in front of the convent . I 've never seen such a crowd ! " " What did he say that you remember ? " Prince Jeta seemed genuinely interested in his granddaughter . Because she was my wife ? " Well , I liked his description of the creation of the world . You know , how everything is really a part of this giant man , and that we 're somewherearound his waist . Of course , Mahavira 's geography is not what we 've been taught at school , but I did like all those different circles of oceans . There is one of milk and one of clarified butter and one of sugar cane . Oh ... " She had a habit of interrupting herself . " I particularly liked his description of the first cycle of creation , when everyone was six miles high and we were all twins and each twin brother would marry his sister twin , as they do in Persia today , and there was no work for anyone to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil would ever want . One tree had leaves that became pots and pans . Another tree grew every kind of food , already cooked . I liked that tree the best . I was a greedy child , I 'm afraid . Then there was a tree thatp210grew clothes and another that grew palaces , though I do n't see how you could pluck a palace like a banana . But perhaps when the palace was ripe , it would come to rest on the ground , which was made of sugar , while the water was wine ... " Ambalika interrupted herself again . " But I 'm not being serious . I 'm only telling you what I remember . He was very old , I thought . I also remember how pleased I was that he was properly dressed , and not sky-clad . " That night our marriage was agreeably consummated . I was pleased . She was pleased . Presumably the Vedic gods were pleased , for nine months later my first son was born . Not long after the wedding , at the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience with King Bimbisara . He received me in a small room that looked out upon dry , dusty gardens , loud with swarminglocusts . Bimbisara was to the point . He was always very much the warrior king if not quite the universal monarch . Incidentally , until I went to Cathay I thought that the idea of a universal monarch was peculiarly Aryan , witness our own Great King . But in Cathay I was told that , once upon a time , a single monarch had ruled all the Middle Kingdom  --  their name for Cathay  --  in perfect harmony with heaven and that one day he will come again and he will be known as the son of heaven . As there is only one deity , there must be only one universal monarch . In actual fact , of course , there are as many false gods in the sky and on earth as there are kings and princes in the world . Yet it is clear to me that all mankind hungers for oneness . The Cathayans are in no way related to the Aryans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wise Lord has inspired them . I asked Bimbisara for permission to go with the caravan to Shravasti . " You are free to go , my son . " Bimbisara treated me as a member ofhis own family , which indeed I was according to Vedic law . " I am curious to meet the Buddha . " Obviously , I made no reference to King Pasenadi 's urgent invitation . " I would give up my kingdom to follow the Buddha , " said Bimbisara . " But I am not allowed . " " The universal monarch may do as he pleases . " At a king 's court , on ( ' is never entirely sincere . Bimbisara tugged at his violet beard . " There is no universal monarch , " he smiled . " As you know . And if there was one , he would probably be Darius . I say this only in private , of course . Your Darius is lord of a great many lands . But he is not lord , as he claims , of all the lands . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord King . " " As you can see . " He repeated vaguely . " If the Buddha should ask you about the horse-sacrifice , say that I was obliged to pay homage to the Aryan gods . "  | " Will he disapprove ? " " He never disapproves . He never approves . But , in principle , he holds all life sacred . Therefore , animal sacrifice is always wrong , just as war is always wrong . " " But you are a warrior and a king and an Aryan . You must sacrifice animals to your gods and kill your enemies in war and wrongdoers in peace . " " And to the extent that I am all these things , I may not know enlightenmentin this incarnation . " There were real tears in the king 's eyes , as opposed to those free-flowing fluids that were forever gushing from his son 's eyes . " I have often hoped that one day I might be able to put away all this . " He touched the jeweled turban that he wore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the Buddha 's eightfold way . " " Why do n't you ? " I was genuinely curious . " I am weak . " With everyone else , Bimbisara was guarded , cautious , cryptic . With me , he was often startingly candid . I suppose that because I was so entirely outside his world , he felt that he could speak freely to mite  --  of nonpolitical matters . Although I was married to his granddaughter , I was still the Great King 's ambassador : one day my embassy would end . Out of delicacy , no one at court ever referred to my eventual depar-t tire . Nevertheless , the return to Persia was always on my mind and , at tntr last meeting , it was also on Bimbisara 's mind . For all he knew , I might decide to continue with the caravan back to Persia . For all I knew , I might very well do just that . My mission had been accomplished . Trade between Persia and Magadha had been established ; and t here was no reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gold and the other iron . But at the time of my audience with Bimbisara , I was undecided . I certainly did not intend to abandon Ambalika . On the other hand , I did not know how she might feel at the thought of leaving India . I also dreaded what Ajatashatru might say and do if I told him that I was going home . I would be drowned in tears , if not the Ganges . " I am weak , " Bimbisara repeated , drying his eyes with his shawl . " I still have work to do here . I am trying to set up a sangha of all the village chiefs . I meet them individually , of course . Now I want them to come together at least once a year and tell me their problems . " " You will make Magadha a republic . " I smiled , to show that I was Joking . I confess that I was somewhat disturbed that he should want to discuss internal politics with a foreigner. lint Bimbisara was simply thinking aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Control them , and you flourish . Oppress them , you perish . I am the first king of Magadha who has known , personally ' , every chief . That is why I am universal monarch . No , I am not making a republic . " Ile had heard nie , after all . " I despise those statesp212where every man with property thinks himself a king . It is unnatural . There can be only one king in any country , as there can be only one sun in the sky or one general at the head of an army . Tell Pasenadi that our affection for him is constant . " " Yes , Lord King . " Bimbisara seemed now ready to get to a point , which I was having some difficulty in anticipating . " Tell him that his sister flourishes . Tell him that she has performed the horse sacrifice . Tell him to disregard those who wish to . . . make trouble between us . They will not succeed , as long as I live . " I looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian king . In fact , he would be offended and alarmed if you did not gaze at him directly  --  but humbly . " Go to the Buddha . Prostrate yourself before the golden one . Tell him that in the thirty-seven years that have passed since we first met , I have practiced six times a month the eightfold morality . Tell him that only recently have I begun to comprehend the truth of what he once said to me : That the only absolute attainment is absolute abandonment . ' Tell him that I have made a private vow that in one year 's time I shall abandon earthly things and follow him . " No one will ever know whether or not King Bimbisara was serious about giving up the world . I believe that he thought he was , which in religious matters counts for slightly more than nothing . Ajatashatru said farewell to me in the chancellery of his father 's palace . For a lover of pleasure , he spent a good deal of his time dealing with the king 's privy council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the actual work of administeringthe country , aided by some thirty councilors , many of them hereditaryand most of them incompetent . As palace chamberlain , Varshakara was in charge not only of the court but of the secret police . Needless to say , he was more powerful than the chancellor , and he would have been more powerful than the king had Bimbisara not chosen to rule in close alliance with the village headmen who not only looked upon the sovereign as a friend at a very corrupt and intricate court but , in his name , they collected taxes , deducted their share and sent on the rest to the treasury . The king was seldom cheated . As at Susa , various councilors administer different functions of the state . Traditionally , in every reign , the high priest is close to the king . But the Buddhist Bimbisara seldom consulted the official custodian of the Vedic gods whose single moment of glory had been the recent celebration of the horse sacrifice . From amongst the privy council , the king appoints a minister for war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's magistrates and hears in his court those cases that do not directly go to the king ; he also appoints a treasurer and a chief tax collector . These last two officials are of great importance and , traditionally , they die rich . But under Birbisara , they were kept on ap213short leash . He had got around them by his alliance with the village chiefs . There are a host of sub-ministers who are known as superintendents . Since all raw metals belong to the king , the iron mines are administered by a superintendent who demanded from me no more than a patriotic five percent of the export value of his master 's iron , which I paid . Since all forests belong to the king , the elephants , tigers , exotic birds , wood for building and firewood come under a single superintendent . In fact , almost every profitable aspect of Indian life is regulated by the state . There are even superintendents in charge of gambling , of the sale of distilled liquors , of the houses of prostitution . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a monarch is vigilant , he can , if he chooses , make things happen rapidly . Otherwise , the day-to-day administration of the state is a slow business , which I regard as a good thing . What you do not do can never be entirely wrong . This , Democritus , is a political and not a religious observation . The thirty members of the privy council sat on low divans in a highvaultedroom on the ground floor of the palace . In a sense , this room corresponds to the second room of our chancellery . As I entered , Ajatashatrurose . As I bowed low  --  to a father-in-law as well as to a prince  --  he came toward me , took me in his arms . " You will not abandon us , my dear ! Oh , please say you wo n't ! " For once the eyes were not full of tears . They were as bright and shiny as a tiger 's when he stares straight at you from a tree 's low branch . I made a graceful , prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long room . He lowered his voice , as people do in palaces all over the world . " Dearest one , tell King Pasenadi that his nephew cares for him as if he were his own son . " " I shall , Lord Prince . " " Tell him "  --  Ajatashatru was now whispering in my ear ; his breath smelled of curry  --  " tell him , as delicately as possible , that our police have learned that there will be an attempt on his life . Very , very soon . You understand  --  and he will understand  --  that we can not openly warn him . It would be embarrassing for us to admit that we have agents in Koshala . But you are neutral . You are from outside . You can tell him to be on his guard . " " But who are the conspirators ? " Then I allowed myself a courtier 's inspiration . " The federation of republics ? " Ajatashatru was obviously grateful for a suggestion that had not , for the moment , occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it almost is , anyway . That is why they are working closely , secretly and , oh , so treacherously with the chief conspirator who is "  --  soundlessly , Ajatashatru mouthed the words  --  " Virudhaka , the son of the king . " I do n't know why I was shocked . After all , the man for whom I was mulled killed his father-in-law . But a father-in-law is not a father and thep214Aryan belief in the father 's sacredness is an essential part of their code . Did I believe Ajatashatru ? I have long since forgotten . But I suspect that I did not . He had a tendency to speak the way a bird sings ; he trilled , chattered , made the air vibrate with meaningless sound . At noon the next day Varshakara accompanied me as far as the north gate of Rajagriha . The first part of the caravan had left before dawn and nearly two miles now separated the head of the caravan from its tail . I was to travel at the center , accompanied by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not certain whether or not I would return with the caravan to Persia . I had been cut off from the real world for more than two years , during which no message had ever got through to me from Susa . I was feeling isolated , to say the least . " We regard Pasenadi as a good ally . " Varshakara spat a wad of crimsonbetel juice at a pariah dog , staining the creature 's ear . To the north , as far as the eye could see , a thousand iron-filled bullockdrawncarts moved slowly through a cloud of yellow dust . The smelted iron was of unusually good quality , thanks to a member of my embassy who was able to teach the Magadhans how to smelt iron in the Persian way . " Because a weak ally is a good ally ? " To joke with Varshakara was rather like poking a stick at a tiger in a flimsy cage . " Sometimes . Sometimes not . But we certainly prefer the old man to his son . " Since the Indian mob at whose center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of our being overheard . " Is it true ? " I asked . Varshakara nodded . " Before the end of the rainy season , there will be a new king . " " I hope that I 'm not there . " " I hope that you can prevent it . " " How ? " " You must warn the old man . I 'm sure that Persia does n't want a strong king in Koshala any more than we do . " " How can there be a strong king if the Buddhists control the coun-try ? " Varshakara looked surprised . " But they do n't . And if they did , what difference would it make ? " Obviously , Varshakara had forgotten his speech to me on the danger Buddhists and Jains present to the established order . Since I thought him mad , I spoke very carefully . " It was my understanding that the monasteries are full of republicans and that they have set out deliberately to weaken Koshala  --  and Magadha , too . " " Quite the contrary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road from Varanasi . " The Jains and the Buddhists are an enormous help to any king . No , it 's Pasenadi himselfp215who is at fault . He is a holy man who thinks only of the next world ... or of no world , or whatever it is those people believe in . This may be admirable in a man but not in a king . The old fool should have abdicated long ago . Then we could have . . . tamed the son . " Although Varshakara 's analysis of Pasenadi 's character did not interestme  --  on principle I never believed a word that he said about political matters  --  I was intrigued to learn that he now appeared to approve of Buddhism . I asked him why . Varshakara 's answer seemed candid . " Any religion that believes that this world is a kind of illness to be got rid of by prayer and by respecting all life and by not wanting earthly possessions is enormously helpful to a ruler . After all , if people do n't want material things , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect all life , they will never try to kill us or overthrow our government . Frankly , we do our best , through the secret police , to encourage the Jains and the Buddhists . Naturally , if we ever saw them as a threat ... " " But their virtues are entirely negative . They wo n't work . They are beggars . How can you make soldiers out of them ? " " We do n't try . Besides , those are just the monks . The majority of the Jains and the Buddhists simply honor Mahavira and the Buddha , and then they go on about their business like everyone else  --  with one difference . They cause us less trouble than everyone else . " " Because they are republicans at heart ? " Varshakara laughed . " Even if they were , what could they do ? Anyway , the world does not interest them , which is very nice for those of us who absolutely dote on the world as it is . " My bullock cart was now at hand . Varshakara and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through the crowd to where my guards were waiting . Although they were dressed as Indians , they were armed as Persians . I insisted that the cart be equipped with an awning and cushioned seats . To my surprise , I had been obeyed . Once Caraka and I were seated , the driver 's whip touched the flanks of the bullocks and , with a jolt , we began the **27;8772;TOOLONG journey to Shravasti . Ambalika did not go with me because she was sick with the fever . Since there was a good possibility that she was also pregnant , we both agreed that it was dangerous for her to travel . " But you will come back , wo n't you ? " Ambalika looked her age , and most forlorn . " Yes , " I said . " As soon as the rainy season is over . " " Then you 'll be able to watch me give birth to your son . " " I shall pray to the Wise Lord that I shall be home by then . " I t+rnbraced her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the three of us will go up to Susa. "  |p216THE  CARAVAN CROSSEDthe Ganges at the river port of Pataligama where the ferrymen are celebrated not only for their clumsiness but for the delight that they take in any sort of disaster . On our account , they had two occasions for high merriment , each involving the loss of a wagonload of iron on a day when the river was as flat and as smooth as a polished-metal mirror . Because of the sun 's heat , we traveled by night and slept by day . We saw no thieves until we entered the forest just south of Vaishali . Here we were attacked by several hundred well-armed bandits who made a great deal of noise but did us no damage . This particular band is esteemedthroughout India because no one may join who is not a legitimateson of a third-generation member of the thieves ' guild . Thieving is so profitable that this particular guild does not want an age-old businessruined by amateurs . The Licchavi capital of Vaishali is also the capital of the union of republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted by the governor of the city , who showed us the congress hall where delegates from the other republics meet . But since congress was not in session , the huge wooden hall was empty . We were also taken to the birthplace of Mahavira , an undistinguished suburban house which already has the unmistakable look of a shrine . It took me a long time to realize that both the Buddha and Mahavira were something far greater than teachers or prophets in the minds of their adherents . They were thought to be greater than any or all of the gods . I found this concept as dizzying as it is appalling . Although ordinary Buddhists and Jains continue to pray to Varuna and Mithra and the other Vedic gods , they regard all these gods as inferior to the twenty-fourth enlightened one and the twenty-fourth maker of river-crossings on the ground that no god can achieve nirvanaor kevala without being reborn as a man . I shall repeat that , Democritus . No god can become enlightened and achieve extinction without first being reborn as a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time  --  now , too , I suppose  --  actually thought that at a given moment in history twop217human beings had evolved to a higher state than that of all the gods that ever were or ever will be . This is titanism , as the Greeks would say . This is madness . While I was in Vaishali , I got the sense that although the republics expected an attack from Magadha , they were having some difficulty in raising troops . This always happens in countries where every man of property thinks himself a king . You can not fight a war with ten thousandgenerals . Despite those unrelenting tributes to the wisdom of the people one must endure hereabouts , any fool knows that the people are not only easily manipulated by demagogues but susceptible to bribery . Worse , the people are seldom eager to submit to the sort of discipline without which no war can be prosecuted , much less won . I predict a return of the tyrants to Athens . Democritus disagrees . It was dawn when we arrived at the north bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . Since the slow , thick , heat-narrowed river makes a wide curve at that particular point , Shravasti is crescentshaped . On the land side , it is surrounded by high brick walls and formidable watchtowers . On the river side , there are all sorts of wharves and docks and warehouses  --  the usual jumble of an Indian river port . A flimsy wooden palisade separates the port from the city proper ; obviously the inhabitants do not fear an attack from the river . In a country without bridges and warships , water is the perfect defense . I was pleased to note that the Great King could seize Shravasti in a day . I was equally pleased to note that in the early morning light , the high towers of Shravasti appeared to be made of roses . Since the caravan was continuing north to Taxila , there was no reason for it to cross the river . So I said farewell to all the embassy except my personal guards and the invaluable Caraka . As we were ferried across the river I began to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers and ferryboats , to crossings and the farther shore . In fact , halfway across the river , when I saw how rapidly the caravan on the north shore had begun to shrink while , simultaneously , the walls and towers and temples of the city were expanding , I was reminded vividly of Prince Jeta 's image . In fact , approaching the residence of the golden one himself , I found myself experiencing , as it were , the image . The shore that I had left was familiar , ordinary life . The river was the torrent of existence in which one might easily drown . Before me was not so much the city of Shravasti as what the Buddhists refer to as " the farther shore from birth and death . " My arrival at Shravasti had been anticipated , and I was met at the clock by a glittering delegation . Prince Jeta himself introduced me to the governor of the city and his suite . These worthies tend to be somewhatfairer of skin and hair than their Magadhan equivalents . They also have about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magadhan court . But then , King Pasenadi had no pretensions to universal monarchhood ; also , he had no chamberlain like Varshakara , whose secret police and sudden arrests made for a constant tension . Whatever Koshala 's misfortunates as a state , life was obviously quite pleasant for those able to live in comfort at Shravasti , that most opulent and luxurious of this world 's cities . " Honored guests usually come from the south and then we meet them at the gates , with a most attractive ceremony . But here at the river ... " The governor apologized for the large mob of dock workers , fishermen , boatmen . They shoved and jostled us , despite a contingent of city policemen who would push back the crowd , which would then push back the police . Although everyone was quite good-natured , it is always an alarming experience to find oneself drowning in the dark odorous flesh of an Indian crowd . Suddenly the cordon of police broke and the pressure of the mob hurled us against the wooden stockade . Fortunately , my Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persians drew their swords . The crowd backed off . Then , in a loud voice , the governor gave orders for the gates to be opened . But the gates remained shut . We were now marooned between the suddenly predatory crowd and the wooden stockade . " This is the way things are in Koshala , " said Prince Jeta , striking down a thief 's arm that had managed to insinuate itself between two Persian guards . " Well , the people seem . . . cheerful , " I said . " Oh , they are remarkably cheerful . " " And there are so many of them , " I added inanely . " Oh , yes , fifty-seven thousand families live in Shravasti . " Meanwhile the governor of the city was shouting orders at the top of his voice while pounding on the gates with his fists . After what seemed an entire cycle of Vedic creation , the wooden gates swung creakily open and just inside the stockade , I was relieved to see a line of troops , spears at the ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more haste than dignity . Horse-drawn chariots were waiting for us but I said that I preferred to walk , for " after three weeks in a bullock cart my legs are stiff . " And so at the head of a somewhat irritable procession , I walked the length of what luckily proved to be the shortest of the four straight avenues that converge on caravan square . Each of the three long avenues begins , respectively , at the southwest , southeast and south gates , and each represents the terminus or point of departure of a caravan route . The vast wealth of Shravasti is due to geography  --  the city is at the crossroads not only for the caravans that go between east and west but for those that go from north to south . As a result , the city is dominated by wealthy magnates , which means that , practically speaking , the Brah/mans and warriors take second and third place to the merchant class , an anomaly in the Vedic world that is much resented by the displaced or , rather , ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Brahmans are entirely dependent upon the merchants , who are like merchants everywhere  --  interested in trade , money , peace . It is only in wartime that the ruling classes come into their own , obliging the merchants to take cover until the danger is past . Prince Jeta believed that the reason why the merchant class supports the Buddhists and the Jains is that the two orders respect all life and disapprove of war . The two orders also appeal to those villagers who worship the pre-Aryan gods . For one thing , villagers prefer peace to war ; for another , they detest those huge and wasteful slaughters of horses and bulls and rams that the Brahmans are forever offering up to the Vedic gods . No villager wants to give up his bullock to anyone , Aryan or non-Aryan , man or god . I think it altogether possible that one clay the Buddhist and Jaina orders will displace the Aryan gods , thanks to the effort of the wealthy merchants in combination with the nonAryanpopulation of the countryside . Until I came to India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular blank walls of different heights arranged haphazardly along winding lanes . Even at Babylon , the houses that look upon the long straight streets are as blank and as windowless as those of any Persian or Greek city . Were it not for the occasional Greek arcade , the monotony would be depressing , particularly in those climates where the common people tend to live out-of-doors all year around . But Shravasti is unlike the western cities . Every house displays windowsand balconies , and the roofs are fantastically turreted . Walls are often decorated with scenes from Rama 's endless life . Many of these paintings are beautifully done  --  or redone  --  since each year the rains wash them away . Some householders now cover their walls with basreliefs , and the effect is delightful . As the governor and I moved slowly down the center of the crowded avenue , horse-drawn chariots made way for us while rich merchants peered down at us from the tops of elephants . Unlike the crowd at the port , the city people were decorous . But then , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention Babylonians , Egyptians , Greeks and even visitors from behind the Himalayas , the yellow folk of Cathay . " To the left , " said Prince Jeta , ever the compassionate guide , " are the bazaars and the manufactories . " He need not have told me . I could hear or smell the specialty of each of the streets or lanes that led from the avenue . One smelled of flowers ; another stank of curing hides . Some quarters were loud with the noise of metal being pounded while others were filled with the sounds of singing birds , to be sold as pets or food. " ' ho the right are the governor ent buildings , the great houses , thep220king 's palace . While here "  --  we were now in the enormous central square  --  " caravans from all over the world meet . " Shravasti 's caravan square is an astonishing sight . Thousands of camels , elephants , bullocks and horses fill the largest city square that I have ever seen . Day and night , caravans arrive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both beasts and men while , entirely at random , tents are pitched and booths set up . Everything is bought and sold by imperturbable merchants . Solemnly they hop from wagonload to wagonload , eyes as sharp and glittering as the eyes of those carrion birds which appear once a battle 's done . From caravan square the royal way proceeds to a green park , at whose center is an elaborate wood-and-brick palace . If somewhat less impressive than Bimbisara 's recent creation , it is far more beautiful . By then I was exhausted . So was my escort . They were , also , less than pleased by the long , hot walk that I had subjected them to . Once inside the palace , they got their revenge . " The king has said that you are to attend him the moment you arrive . " The sweating chamberlain was very happy . I was not . " But I am dusty ... " " Today the king is indifferent to protocol . " " In that case , the king will not mind if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be indifferent to protocol , Lord Ambassador , but he expects to be obeyed in all things . " " But I have gifts from the Great King ... " " Another time . " " I 'm sorry , " whispered Prince Jeta . As the chamberlain led me through a series of high-ceilinged rooms , inset with plaques of silver , with mother-of-pearl and ivory , I was very much aware that the splendor of the surroundings was in vivid contrast to the grubbiness of my person . Finally , without ceremony , I was shown into a small room where ogival windows looked onto trees , flowering vines , a marble fountain with no water in it . Silhouetted against the window were two elderly Buddhist monks with shaved heads . For a moment I thought that I had been brought to the wrong room . I stared dumbly at the two old men . They smiled at me . They looked like brothers . Then the smaller of the two said , " Welcome , Cyrus Spitama , to our court . " As I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " No , no . You are a holy man . You must kneel only for those who worship ... fire , is n't it ? " " We only worship the Wise Lord . The fire is simply his messenger to us . " Although I was much too tired to preach more of a sermon than that , I found the king 's sweetness relentless.  | " Of course . Of course . You worship a sky god . So do we , do n't we , Sariputra ? " " Yes , indeed . We have every sort of god imaginable , " said the tall , fragile-looking Sariputra . " Including those that are unimaginable , " added Pasenadi . " The Wise Lord is the only god , " I said . " We also have only gods , too . Do n't we , Sariputra ? " " Quantities , my dear . " I was by now used to the way Indian holy men address their disciples ... as if speaking to small children whom they love . The " my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing " my dear 's " of Ajatashatru , whose use of endearments was always calculated to keep others off-guard . " I think that is a contradiction , " I said stilly . " We have those , too , " said King Pasenadi mildly . " In fact , life itself is a contradiction if only because "  --  Sariputra giggled  --  " birthis the direct cause , in every single case , of death . " The two old men laughed happily . Since I was by now in a thoroughly bad temper , I became formal . " I come to you from the Achaemenid , from Darius the Great King , the lord of all the lands , the king of kings . " " My dear , we know , we know ! And you will be able to tell us all about Darius when we receive you at our court , in state . Then , and only then , will we receive the messenger  --  no , the ambassador of that Persian king whose presence in the valley of the Indus River has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , for now , we are simply two old men who would follow the eightfold path . As a king , I can not go as far as I would like . But , fortunately , I am now an arhat , while Sariputra here is unusullyclose to enlightenment . " " My dear , I am no such thing ! I serve the Buddha and the order , in little ways . . . " Listen to him , Cyrus Spitama ! It was Sariputra who created the order . It is he who makes all the rules . It is he who sees to it that whatever the Buddha says or has said will be remembered . Why , ti ; u-iputra himself remembers every single word that the Buddha has spoken since that day in the deer park at Varanasi . " " My dear , you exaggerate . It is Ananda , not I , who remembers every word . All that I do is put those words into verses that even little children can learn . " He turned to me . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not well . " I had the sense that I was going mad . I could not believe that one of these two old men ruled a country as large as Egypt , and that the other was the head of the Buddhist order . They struck me as perfect simpletons . " I can see that you do n't see . But you are tired . Even so , you will want to know what happened . In due course , a young lady arrived in Shra/vasti . She said that she was from the Gotama clan , just like the golden one himself ! Oh , I was thrilled ! After we were married , the golden one told me what a lovely joke had been played on me . Apparently the Shakyas did not want to mix their noble blood with the royal house of Koshala . On the other hand , they did not dare to offend me . So they sent me a common prostitute . And I married her . But when I found out , was I angry , dear Sariputra ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no , I was not . " Pasenadi looked hurt . " Oh , yes , you were . You were in such a temper that we feared for you . " " I seemed to be , perhaps . " " My dear , you were . " " My dear , I was not . " Mercifully , some great hand has eliminated the rest of that scene from my memory . It is possible that I fainted dead away . The Persian embassy was housed in a small building at one end of the palace gardens . Between us and the palace , there were fountains , flowers , trees  --  and silence . Even the peacocks made no sound  --  were their tongues slit ?  --  while the band of sacred monkeys would watch us , in perfect silence , from the treetops . At the center of a great city , the king had created a forest retreat . During the week that I was allowed to prepare myself for the formal presentation to the king , Prince Jeta took me in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building that overlooked the river . In the prince 's civilized company , my encounter with the two silly old men seemed like a fever-dream . But when I told Prince Jeta the story of my receptionby King Pasenadi , he was both amused and perturbed . " The old man is like that , " he said . We were seated on the roof of Prince Jeta 's house . As the sun set over dull-blue hills , the clouds made strange streak patterns , a characteristic of the start of the monsoon season . The sky-dome that covers the Indian earth is mysteriously heightened  --  atrick of light ? I do n't know the reason but the effect is awesome , and for man diminishing . " Does Pasenadi 's behavior explain why the state dissolves ? " " Things are not that bad . " Prince Jeta spoke precisely . " Koshala is still a great power . Pasenadi is still a great king . " I mouthed the word " Spies ? " Prince Jeta nodded . But up to a point , he had meant what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now both an arhat and a king , and it is very hard to be both . I know , in my own small way . " " What is an arhat ? " " The word means one who has killed the enemy . ' In this case , human desire . "  | " Like the Buddha . " " Except that an arhat still exists  --  unlike the Buddha , who has come and gone . There are those who think that since Sariputra is every bit as holy as Gotama , he , too , has achieved nirvana . But this is not possible . Buddha is always singular  --  in the present tense . In the past , there have been twenty-three Buddhas . In the future , there will be one more Buddha and that will be the end of that , for this cycle of time . " " Sariputra is actually considered ... holy ? " " Oh , yes ! There may be some doubt about Pasenadi , but there is none about Sariputra . After the Buddha , he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the sole creator of the order . It was he who gave the monks their rules . Now he and Ananda are assembling every word that the Buddha has said . " Do they write down these words ? " " Of course not . Why should they ? " " They should n't . " In those days I believed that whenever holy words were written down , they lost their religious potency . I believed that the Wise Lord 's words must live not in writing on a cowhide but in the mind of the true believer . Unfortunately , I could not explain this to my Zoroastriancousins at Bactra , who had picked up from the Greeks the mania for writing . Democritus thinks that the first religious texts were Egyptian . Who knows ? Who cares ? I still believe that the writing down of hymns and sacred stories is bound to diminish religious feeling . Certainly , there is nothing more magical than a religious narrative or injunction or prayer at work in the mind , just as there is nothing more effective than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory the words of Truth . Nevertheless , over the years , I have changed . I now want a complete written record of my grandfather 's words on the simple ground that if we survivors do not make it , others will , and the true Zoroaster will vanish beneath a stack of illuminated oxhides . Without ceremony of any kind , we were joined on the roof by a handsome man of forty . He wore full armor , and carried a helmet that looked to be made of gold . Prince Jeta dropped to his knees . I went to one knee , assuming , correctly , that this was Virudhaka , the heir to the throne . Virudhaka was quick to put us at our ease . With a graceful gesture he motioned for us to sit on the divan . " We shall see each other officially tomorrow , Lord Ambassador . But I thought it might be more pleasurablefor us to meet like this , with our noble friend . " In the name of the Great King , I agreed . Out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three questions were very much on my mind . Was he contemplating parricide ? If he was , would he succeed ? If he succeeded , what would that mean for Persia ? Unaware of my dark thoughts , Virudhaka asked a number of intelli/gent questions about Persia . Other than Bimbisara , he was the first Indian of high rank to acknowledge the extent of the Great King 's power . " In some ways , " he said , " Darius seems very close to being the long-predicted universal monarch . " " We think , Lord Prince , that he is the universal monarch . " All the color had now gone out of the sky . Night birds soared and dived . The air smelled of rain . " But should n't this universe include Koshala ? and the republics ? and Magadha ? and the south of India ? And back of those mountains "  --  he pointed to the high dark Himalayas  --  " there is Cathay , a world far larger than Persia and all the western lands put together . Ought not Cathay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said that they claim to have their own universal monarch . " I was tactful . Virudhaka shook his head . " There are many kingdoms in Cathay . But they lack the monarch who will unite them . " " Monarch ? Or god ? " asked Prince Jeta . " I should think that a true universal monarch would have to be very like a god . " " I thought you Buddhists were atheists . " Virudhaka laughed to show that he was serious . " No , we accept all the gods . They are a necessary part of the cosmic landscape . " Prince Jeta was serene . " Naturally , the Buddha ignores them . Naturally , the gods venerate him . " " I steer clear of these matters , " said Virudhaka . " I have only one interest . That is Koshala . " He turned to me . " We have our problems . " " What kingdom has not , Lord Prince . " " Some less than others . Bimbisara now claims to be the universal monarch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You heard . " " But I ca n't say that I understand it . After all , Bimbisara 's entire country is not as large or as rich as the Great King 's satrapy of Lydia . " From the beginning , it was my policy to awe but not to alarm the Indians . I doubt if I was particularly successful . " And Lydia is only one of twenty satrapies . " " That may be , " said Virudhaka . " But in this part of the world , only the Indus valley is subject to Persia , and that . . . satrapy is a long way from Koshala . Also , your king must know that we have never been defeated in war . What concerns us is this : Bimbisara claims to be universalmonarch . Yet the horse sacrifice went badly . He had hoped to acquireVaranasi . He failed . Now my cousin Ajatashatru is raising an army . This means that when the rainy season ends , he will cross the Ganges and we shall be at war . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swimmer beneath the water  --  " that Prince Ajatashatru fears only the republics . " " He fears them as much as we do , which is not at all . " Virudhaka wasp225sharp . " No , the war will be directed not against the republics but against us . We will win , of course . " " Of course , Lord Prince . " I waited for the inevitable request . " Persia controls the Indus valley . " " But , as you 've just said , the satrapy of India is a long way from Koshala . " I let Virudhaka 's own words mock him . But he was unabashed . " In the dry season , " he said , " five hundred miles need not be a world away . " As we talked we vanished into the moonless night , our disembodied voices mingling with the voices from the riverbank far below . At one point there was a lull in the conversation , and suddenly I felt that we had become extinct . Is this nirvana ? I wondered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was direct , for an Indian prince . He told me that he wanted an alliance with Persia against Magadha . When I asked him what Persia would gain by such an arrangement , the prince proceeded to overwhelm me with good things . " We control the overland route to Cathay . We have a monopoly on the silk trade . We are the center for every important route to and from the farthest east . From Burma we import rubies and jade . Through us you can reach the south of India not only by land but also by water , once the port of Champa reverts to us . " There was a good deal more in this vein . Then he told me exactly how many troops would be needed and when they would be needed , and where . Virudhaka 's speech to me had been carefully prepared . As the prince spoke , I could imagine the expression on Darius ' face when I told him of all the wealth that I had seen assembled in Shravasti 's caravan square . I could also imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that the prince wanted to make an alliance with Persia . Here , at last , was the perfect pretext for the conquest of all India . The Persian army would be welcomed by Koshala . Magadha would then be crushed and Koshala would be absorbed , painlessly . Darius was a master of the delicate art of attaching to himself someoneelse 's kingdom . But then , every Persian schoolboy knows by heart Cyrus ' famous speech to the Medes : " Through your present submission you have preserved your lives . As for the future , if you behave in the same manner , no ill will befall you , unless it be that the same person will not govern you that governed you before . But you shall live in the same houses and you shall cultivate the same land ... " This speech defines the perennial policy of the Achaemenid . Nothing changes for a conquered people but the sovereign ; and since the Achaemenidis always a just sovereign , he is usually received with joy , as Cyrus was by the Medes . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semblance of ' power to the old ruling houses . There was no reason why Ajatashatrtt and Virudhaka could not remain asp226satraps . . . no reason except that any Achaemenid who trusted either of those subtle princes would be a fool . " I will do what I can , Lord Prince . " I was both enigmatic and encouraging  --  inthe best Susan style . " There is not much time . The rains are about to begin . When they do , the sea route will be impossible , while the overland trail will be  --  Where does your caravan stop during the monsoon ? " " At Taxila . I 've allowed three months to complete the final negotia-tions . " " But you could return to Persia when the rains stop ? " " Yes . But since you feel . . . pressed for time , I could send a draft of a treaty between us to the satrap of India . He would then send it up to Susa and we could have an answer before the start of the dry season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was playing for time . First the caravan must get through . Then I must report to Darius . Then .. . Who knows ? Virudhaka was now on his feet . We rose too . The three of us were somewhat darker than the night sky . Virudhaka gave me a ritual embrace . " The privy council will prepare a treaty , " he said . " I hope that you will work with them . I also hope that you will personally translate the treaty into Persian . That 's all-important . " " The king ... " Prince Jeta said the phrase , and no more . " The king will agree , " said Virudhaka . " He is not yet entirely detachedfrom his kingdom . " Then he was gone . Prince Jeta and I strolled to the parapet and looked down . A thousand small fires burned in the blackness like so many earth-trapped stars . The river people were preparing their evening meal . As we looked down , I whispered into Prince Jeta 's ear what I had been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both hands . " They wanted you to tell me this . " " No doubt . But is it true ? " Prince Jeta shook his head . " The son is loyal to the father . Why should n't he be ? The son has a free hand . Pasenadi seldom interferes . He  --  " Prince Jeta paused . Then he said , " We are being sent a message . But what is it ? What do they really want ? " " They want a war with the republics . " " With Koshala too . But they can not face both the federation and Koshala . So if they could divide Koshala by making trouble between father and son ... " Prince Jeta did not need to finish . " It is clever , " I said . " Except that , if we were to tell no one "  --  Prince Jeta looked at me as if he could actually make out my expression in the dark  --  " there would be no division , would there ? " We agreed to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p227of  course , each of us intended to use this information to further his own ends because that is the way of courts and the world . Yet I was puzzled because Prince Jeta had seemed puzzled . Had Ajatashatru lied to me ? And if he had , why ? THE NEXT MORNING , while I was being dressed in Persian costume for my presentation to the king , the first of the monsoon rains crashed over the rooftops of Shravasti . A few moments later I was joined by the wet and disheveled Caraka . " There 's something wrong , " he announced , ignoring the all-attentive barber . " The king has been in council all morning . The prince is on the walls , with the archers  --  " Caraka stopped , at last aware of the barber . " Can it be ... " I began but did not finish a sentence whose meaning Caraka understood . " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't think so . " As the barber brushed my lips with lac he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew what we did not know . At noon I was escorted to the crowded reception hall . Although the gifts from the Great King had been placed at the foot of the silver throne , the throne itself was empty . The usually serene and rather cold-blooded Koshalan nobles seemed anxious as their voices blended in with the sound of the rain falling on the tile roof . I stood in the doorway , my embroidered splendor unremarked . Finally the chamberlain saw me . Hurrying forward , he dropped his wand of office . Then he picked it up the wrong way around , saluted me incorrectly and stammered , " I am sorry , Lord Ambassador . You must think us savages . But there 's been  --  Please . Come with me . Your suite , too . " We were shown into a sntall chamber just off ' the anteroom . Then thep228door was not shut , but slammed behind us . Caraka and I exchanged a look . The rain on the roof was now so loud that we could barely hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Long life to the king ! " Caraka whispered , " Which king ? " I spread my hands . I was as prepared to deal with Virudhaka as I was with Pasenadi . My only fear was that war might break out between Magadha and Koshala before Darius could take advantage of the situation . Suddenly a conch shell sounded three blasts . Since this is the traditionalcall to battle , I was , for the first time , alarmed . Had the royal house been overthrown ? Were enemy soldiers in the palace ? The chamberlainappeared ; he was out of breath , as if he had been running . " The king is on the throne , " he said . " This way , Lord Ambassador . " We were hurried into the audience chamber , where a glittering figure sat upon the silver chair . In one hand , a sword ; in the other , an ivory sceptre . The chamberlain announced the arrival of the embassy from the Great King of Persia . Then , escorted by ushers , I walked toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wispy monk that I had met my first day in Shravasti . Not until I had saluted the sovereign did I realize that this stern , bejeweled monarch was indeed Pasenadi . The face was as carefully painted and as empty of expression as any Vedic god . There was no trace at all of the giggling monk whom I 'd met with Sariputra . With cold formality the king said , " We hope for good relations with our brother in Persia . " The voice was loud , distinct , emotionless . " We shall work to that end . We send him our fraternal blessing . We  --  " Pasenadi stopped . He seemed to have lost track of what he was saying . There was a long , slightly embarrassed moment as we stared at the king , who was looking past us at the door . Although I heard footstepsbehind me , I did not dare turn my back on the king . Then Virudhakapassed me ; he was dripping with rainwater . At the foot of the throne he made a filial salute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear , he said , " It is true . " Pasenadi put down the sceptre . He got to his feet . He held the hilt of the sword in both hands , as if it were a torch to light some bloody way . " We have just learned that our beloved brother King Bimbisara has been deposed by his son Prince Ajatashatru , who asks for our blessing . We do not give it . Cursed is the son who raises his hand against the one who begat him . Cursed is the land whose sovereign usurps his father 's place . Cursed is Ajatashatru . " With remarkable agility the old man skipped down the steps to the floor , and king , prince , councilors of state swept from the room . Then the chamberlain hurried us out of the room . The formal ceremonies ofp229the court at Shravasti were plainly in abeyance , and the Great King 's gifts remained unaccepted . Caraka was particularly glum ; after all , we had carried those chests of rugs and jewels halfway across the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not to have the Great King 's gifts acknowledged . " " War takes precedence , " I said with statesmanlike sagacity . " But since there can be no fighting until the dry season , we 're bound to see the king quite soon . " But we saw neither king nor prince for two months . Daily , despite the rains , delegations from every corner of the kingdom arrived at court . The privy council was in constant session . Meanwhile the street of the metalworkers was shut off to everyone except spies , and it was as a spy that Caraka penetrated the quarter . " Swords , spearheads , armor , " he reported . " They work nights as well as days . " War had indeed taken precedence over all other activities . It was Prince Jeta who told me what had happened at Rajagriha . In a council meeting Ajatashatru had asked for permission to cross the Ganges River and attack the federation of republics . Although Bimbisarahad agreed that the federation could not withstand the Magadhanarmies , he made the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worth the effort of a war . Besides , was he not already universal monarch ? He took very seriously the horse sacrifice . Too seriously , as it turned out . A few days later , without consultinghis father , Ajatashatru claimed Varanasi in his mother 's name . Bimbisara was furious ; he said that Varanasi was an integral part of Koshala . With that , he dismissed the council . The next evening , shortly after sunset , Ajatashatru 's personal guards entered the royal palace and arrested the king . Since the move had been as swift as it was unexpected , there was no resistance . " Bimbisara is now being held prisoner at Vulture 's Peak . That 's a tower in the old town . " Prince Jeta betrayed neither surprise nor grief . Ile knew the world . " It is said that no one has ever escaped from Vulture 's Peak . " " What happens now ? " " My son-in-law and your father-in-law is a fierce and determined man who appears to want war . If that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were seated on the inner verandah of Prince Jeta 's house . Just opposite us a row of banana trees trembled in the rain-scented wind . " I would not have thought it , " I said . " Ajatashatru always ... wept so easily . " " Ile was playing a part . Now he will be himself . " " No . I le will simply play a new part , without  --  or perhaps with  --  all those tears . Most lives at a court , " I added , with Iirahmanical certainty , " are spent putting on and taking off masks . "  |p230Prince  Jeta was amused . " You sound like one of us . Only instead of changing masks , we change existences . " " But unlike the courtier , you have no memory of your earlier selves . " " Except for the Buddha . He is able to remember each of his previous incarnations . " " Like Pythagoras . " Prince Jeta ignored this obscure reference . " But the Buddha once said that if he were actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , he would have no time left to live out this one , which is the most important of all , since it is the last . " There was a sudden gust of wind . Clusters of unripe bananas were torn from the branches opposite us . The rains fell . " Bimbisara told me that he hoped to become a monk in a year 's time . " " Let us pray that he will be allowed to . " For a time we watched the rain . " How curious , " I said finally , " that Ajatashatru should have wanted me to warn Pasenadi against his son . " " But how shrewd ! While we look for a plot in Shravasti , he executes one in Rajagriha . " " But why go to the trouble of misleading me ? " " To put you off the scent . After all , sooner or later , he must deal with Persia . " Prince Jeta gave me an odd look . " One day all of us will have to deal with Persia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our richest countries . " " Not seized , Prince Jeta . The rulers of the Indus Valley asked the Great King to include them in his empire . " I sounded rather like an eighty-year-old court eunuch from the time of Cyrus . " Forgive me . I was tactless . " Prince Jeta smiled . " Anyway , Ajatashatruwants to make as much trouble for Koshala as he can . What can not be seized from without must be acquired through division from within . So he tries to turn son against father . " " Has he ? " " He does n't need to . Pasenadi wants to be both a king and an arhat . That 's not possible . So Virudhaka is not . . . happy . And who can blame him ? " Several days later , Caraka presented me with a personal message from Ajatashatru ; it was written on cowhide with red ink , a suitable color . Together we deciphered the difficult lettering . The gist was : " You are as close to our heart as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were our own son . You will then mourn , as do I , the death of my father , the universal monarch Bimbisara . He was in the seventy-eighth year of his life and in the fifty-first year of his glorious reign . The court will be in mourning until the end of the rainy season , when we shall expect our beloved son , Cyrus Spitama , to attend us at our coronation . " Needless to say , there was no reference to how Bimbisara died . Somep231days later we learned that Ajatashatru had personally strangled his father with that silken cord which Indian protocol requires in the case of a deposed sovereign . I passed a number of uneasy weeks in the steaming , rank gardens of Pasenadi 's palace . Neither king nor prince sent for me . There was no message of any kind from Susa . There was even silence from the caravanat Taxila . My isolation was broken , finally , by the arrival of Prince Jeta and the monk Sariputra . They appeared , unannounced , on the verandah . I helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Sariputra in the garden , " said Prince Jeta , " and I told him how much you would like to talk to him . " I excused the lie . I was desperate for company , even that of a Buddhist arhat with black gums . While Caraka sent for wine , Sariputra sat on the floor and Prince Jeta sat on a cushion . I perched on a stool . The old man bestowed on me what I took to be a smile . " My dear  --  " he began . Then stopped . " Perhaps you would like to question him . " Prince Jeta looked at me expectantly . " Or , perhaps , " I said perversely , recalling my own spiritual mission , " he would like to question me . " " The Buddha has been known to ask questions . " Prince Jeta was tactful . " As has Sariputra . " " Yes . " There was something in the old man 's unremitting benignity t hat reminded me of a well-fed baby ; on the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serpent 's . " Do you like games , my child ? " " No , " I said . " Do you ? " " Eternal games , yes ! " Sariputra laughed , alone . " Why , " I asked , " have you no interest at all in the Wise Lord and in his prophet Zoroaster ? " ' All things are interesting , my child . And since it is plainly interestingfor you to tell me about your Wise Lord , you must . This very minute ! ' frith can not wait , they say . I ca n't think why . Everything else does . But tell me . " I told him . When I had finished , Sariputra said to Prince Jeta , " This Wise Lord sounds exactly like Brahma trying to pass himself off as a Persian . Oh , those gods ! They change their names from country to country and think that we wo n't notice . But we always do ! They ca n't fool us , can they ? Or escape us . But that Brahma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks he s the creator . Imagine ! Oh , you should have heard him when lie carne to the Buddha that first time . No , not the first time , the second time . The first time was when lie begged the Buddha to set the wheel ( if the doctrine in motion . Oh , Brahma was very insistent , very persua/sive . Because he knows that he 'll have to be reborn as a human being before he can obtain nirvana , and when he 's reborn the only way that he 'll be able to achieve nirvana is through the Buddha . He 's not really a fool , you know . He just sounds like one . Anyway , the Buddha allowed himself to be persuaded since Brahma is the best of the gods , which is not saying very much , is it ? So the Buddha agreed  --  that was after their first visit  --  to set the wheel in motion , which was a great sacrifice for the Buddha , since he himself had already achieved nirvana and is no longer here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Brahma came to him a second time . At Rajagriha it was . We must ask Ananda exactly when and where , he remembers everything , no matter how trivial . This was all before my time . So Brahma told the Buddha , I am Brahma . I am the great Brahma , the king of the gods . I am uncreated . I have created the world . I am the sovereign of the world . I can create , alter and give birth . I am the father of all things . ' Now , we all know that this is perfect nonsense . But the Buddha is always polite . He is also sublime . If you exist , Brahma , ' he said most gently , you were created . If you were created , you will evolve . If you evolve , your aim must be release from the fire and the flux of creation . Therefore , you must become what I already am . You must take the last step on the eightfold path . You must cease to evolve and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " Never before or since have I heard such blasphemy . " Oh , he was upset . Would n't you be ? I mean , there he is , just like your Wise Lord  --  ever so full of himself and ever so powerful , or so he thinks . Yet if he is all-powerful , then he is quite capable of not being , a state that he craves but can not obtain , which is why he begged the Buddha to set the wheel of the doctrine in motion . " " You are absolutely certain that this was indeed the Wise  --  I mean Brahma who spoke to the Buddha ? " " Of course I 'm not certain ! This is all a dream , my dear , and in dreams some things make less sense than others . I mean , it all depends on where you are standing when you sleep , does n't it ? " I confess that I had the sense that I , too , was either dreaming or going mad . " Zoroaster actually heard the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Brahma heard the answers of the Buddha . " Sariputra noddedencouragingly , as if a dull student had succeeded in adding one to one . " Out of reverence , I am obliged to say that Zoroaster heard the answers of the Wise Lord , and not the other way around . " " I say it the other way around , out of reverence for the Buddha . There is only one Buddha at any given moment . " " There is only one Wise Lord . " " Except when he sneaks off to India and tries to pass himself off as Brahma . Anyway , he 's not the only god . He 's just the most conceited . "  |p233As  best I could , I maintained my rigid courtier 's mask . " You deny that the Wise Lord is the sole creator of all things ? " " Of course , my dear . And so do you . " Then the wicked old man repeated back to me what I had chanted for him from the holiest of our texts : " Ahura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wise Lord . After the act of creation , he became the Wise Lord , eager for increase , wise , free from adversity , manifest  --  ' I 've forgotten the rest of his attributes that you so kindly recited for us just now . My memory is not what it was . " I continued grimly , "  --  ever ordering aright , bounteous , all-perceiving . ' " " Yes , yes . And by his clear vision Ahura Mazdah saw that the destructivespirit would never cease from aggression . . . ' And so he goes and makes a trap for the destructive spirit when he invents , out of infinite time , time of the long dominion . Oh , my dear , this is all so elaborate ! f he is the all-powerful creator , why did he invent the destructive spirit to begin with ? What is the point ? But once it was invented , why must he go to the trouble of battling his own invention ? This was really not very wise of him , was it ? And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must constantly do battle with his very first Grea-t ion . . . Well , that is definitely not kind . " " The fact of evil is not kind , Sariputra . But as good exists , so does evil , and the battle between the two must continue until good triumphs at he end of time of the long dominion . " " Since the good will win , anyway , why bother with the battle ? " " Because it is the will of the Wise Lord . Out of himself , he created ill human souls at once . And these eternal spirits exist with him until t hey are obliged to take human form . Then they make a choice . They follow either the Truth or the Lie . If they follow the Truth , they will earn merit . If the Lie ... " " Yes , dear child . Slow as my brain is , I have grasped the concept . But why make everyone suffer so ? " " How else is evil to be overthrown ? " " IUy removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and can  --  first self , then world . " " The world is . The self is . Evil is . Good is . Contest is  --  inevitable , and ordained . " " ' Then it is better not to be at all , is n't it ? And that can be achieved by following the eightfold way . " The old man was even more maddening than the worst of our local sophists . " All things struggle  --  " I began. "  --  except those that do n't , " he ended . " But your Wise Lord , just like , fir own proud , if ' rather tricky Brahma , is as in the dark as the rest of its creations . I le has no idea where he is going any more than he knows where he dune from . "  | " The Wise Lord knows that he will trap and destroy the evil Ahriman in time of the long dominion . When he does , all souls will be saved . " " So he says . But he , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Then was . Now is . But will he be ? " " Before the Wise Lord was the Wise Lord . " " And before that ? He says , if you quote him correctly , before the act of creation , I was not lord . ' If he was not , who was ? And where did this creator come from ? " " Time  --  " " Ah , time ! But where does time come from ? " " Time was . Is . Will be . " " Perhaps . Perhaps not . I talk , dear child , of first things because they interest you . They do not interest us . We have no curiosity about the origin of things , about creation . We have no way of knowing what was first , or if there is such a thing as a first thing in time or space , or outside time or space . It is all the same . Gods , men , ghosts , animals , fish , trees ... these are all manifestations of a creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flux and nothing remains the same . Is that not true ? " " There is a single source  --  " I began . But Sariputra was no longer listening to me . " The first thing I do with our novitiates is to take them to cemeteries where I show them decomposingbodies . We study the new life that springs from the dead . We watch the maggots lay their eggs in the putrefying flesh . Then the eggs hatch and a new generation of maggots eats its fill until in time  --  of a very very short dominion , my dear  --  there is nothing but bone left and the poor maggots starve and die . But out of their dust come plants , insects , invisible kernels of life , and the chain goes on and on and on  --  and who would not want to break that painful chain if he could ? " " The chain breaks when the Wise Lord prevails and all is light . " " I must say that sounds very like Brahma . But as he himself admits  --  that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more idea just how things will end than he knows how he himself started . He is in mid-river , like the rest of us . Naturally , his river is greater than ours , but the principle of any river is the same . As you yourself sang so beautifully . . . no , no , really beautifully , Time is mightier than both creations  --  the creation of the Wise Lord and that of the destructive spirit . ' With us , child , time is only a part of the dream from which you must awaken if you are to be enlightened . " " And extinguished ? " " You have learned the lesson , Cyrus Spitama ! " The wicked creature applauded me . Although not one of Sariputra 's arguments could be intelligently defended , I remembered Darius ' command . I was to learn as well as to teach or , to put it another way , one can not teach without first knowingp235just what it is that others believe to be true . In those days I never doubted my mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the same time I was deeply curious about the origin  --  if any  --  of creation ; and , somewhat embarrassingly , Sariputra had drawn attention to a curious gap in Zoroaster 's perception of divinity . Yes , Democritus , you , too , have noticed the same omission . But that is because you are interested only in what is material . We are interested in what is holy . I agree that it has never been clear how or when or why the Wise Lord was born out of infinite time , which itself can never be truly understood , since what is infinite is , by definition , not only not yet but never yet . But until I met the Buddhists , I did not think it possible for a religion or philosophy or world view of any complexity to exist without a theory of creation , no matter how imprecise . But here was a sect or order or religion which had captured the imagination of two powerfulkings and many wise men , and the order had done so without ever taking seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Worse , Buddhists regard all gods with the same sort of amiable contemptthat educated Athenians do . But the Athenians are fearful of prosecution by public opinion , while the Buddhists are indifferent to the superstitions of the Brahmans . They do not even care enough about the gods to turn them into devils the way Zoroaster did . The Buddhists accept the world as it is , and try to eliminate it . Meanwhile , in the here and now , they suggest that it is probably better than not for the ordinary Buddhist layman to be joyful , friendly , equable and compassionate ; members of the order , however , must relinquishnot only the sorrows of this world but the joys as well . " After we 've studied the rotting corpses , I remind the novitiates how truly disgusting the living body is . Since many novitiates are young , t hey are still attracted to women , which of course links them to the chain of being . So I show them how the body of the most beautiful woman is like a wound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole body is covered with a clammy skin that  --  " " Slow as my brain is , I have grasped the concept , " I said , evening somewhat the score . " My dear , if you really have , you are now spinning for yourself the wheel of doctrine ! Such a clever child . " Sariputra looked at Prince Jeta . Although the monk 's face was smiling , the eyes were as bright and unblinking as a parrot 's . He was a disconcerting figure . " I think , " said Prince Jeta , " that the time has come for our friend to attend the Buddha . " " Why not ? " I ) ernocritus wants to know exactly who the Buddha was and where he carne from . The first question is probably not answerable . I know that I asked it often enough when I was in India , and I received ap236marvelous variety of responses . Indians do not have our interest in facts ; their sense of time is different from ours , while their apprehension of reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter because the world is only shifting matter . They think that they are dreaming . THIS IS WHAT I THINKI know about the Buddha . At the time that I met him  --  more than a half-century ago  --  he was about seventy-two or - three years old . He was born in the Shakya republic , which is located in the foothills of the Himalayas . He came from a warrior family called Gotama . At birth , he was named Siddhartha . He was brought up in the capital city of Kapilavastru . At one time Gotama 's father held high office in the republic , but he was hardly a king , as certain snobs at Shravasti and Rajagriha still like to pretend . Siddhartha married . He had one son , Rahula  --  which means link or bond . I suspect that the child must have begun life with another name , but I never found out what it was . He certainly proved to be a bond with that world which the Buddha was to eliminate  --  for himself . At the age of twenty-nine Siddhartha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was acutely conscious that he was " liable to birth because of self , and knowing the peril in whatever is liable to birth , he sought the uttermost security from this world 's bonds  --  nir-vana . " Siddhartha 's quest took seven years . He lived in the forest . He mortifiedthe flesh . He meditated . In due course , through his own efforts  --  or simply because he had evolved in the course of all his previous incarnations ?  --  he understood not only the cause of pain but its cure . He saw all that was and all that will ever be . In a magical contest he defeated the evil god Mara , who is lord of this world . Siddhartha became the enlightened one or the Buddha . Since he hadp237eliminated not only himself but the tangible world as well , he is higher than all the gods : they are still evolving and he is not . They continue to exist within a world that he has entirely dissolved . Since enlightenmentis an end in itself  --  the great end , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the world that he had awakenedfrom returned to him , as it were , when the high god Brahma came down from heaven and begged him to show others the way . But the Buddha was not interested . Why speak , he said , of what can not be described ? But Brahma was so insistent that the Buddha agreed to go to Varanasi and set in motion the wheel of the doctrine . He expounded the four truths ; and he revealed the eightfold path . Yet at the same time , paradoxically , the entire exercise was  --  is  --  pointless because he had abolished this world and all other worlds , too . " Everything subject to causation , " the Buddha said , " is like a mirage . " For him , human personality is something like a bad dream  --  to l ) e got rid of , preferably , by waking up to . . . nothing ? There is a point beyond which I can not follow the Buddha . But then , he is enlightened and I am not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the Wise Lord . For Buddhists and Jains , the world deterioates ; therefore , extinctionis the goal of the wise . For Zoroaster , each man must make his way either toward the Truth or the Lie , and in eternity he will be judged for what he did or did not do in the course of only one life . Finally , after a time in heaven or hell , all human souls will share in the Wise Lord 's victory over Ahriman , and we shall achieve a perfect state of being that is not so different from the Buddha 's sunyata , or shining void  --  if that is the right translation of a word which explains so precisely the inexplicable . For the Indians , all creatures are subject to constant reincarnation . Punishment and rewards in any given life are the result of previous deeds , in previous lives . One is totally subject to one 's karma , or destiny . For us , there is suffering or joy in time of the long dominion and , finally , union with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is endless death and rebirth , only broken for a very few by nirvana , which is nothing , and sunyata , which is what it is if it is . Democritus thinks that the two attitudes are not so far apart . I know flat they are entirely unlike . Admittedly , there is something luminous it slippery about the Buddha 's conception of sunyata ; in fact , the more I think of his truths , the more I feel that I am trying to catch with two clumsy hands one of those swift eels that writhe at night in hot southern was , ablaze with cold light . At the core of the Buddhist system there is an empty space which is not just the sought-after nirvana . It is perfect atheism . To my knowledge , the Buddha never discussed any of the gods exceptin the most offhand way . I le never denied them ; he simply ignoredp238them . But despite his formidable conceit , he did not set himself in place of the gods because , by the time he had set in motion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , which is the ultimate stage of evolution . But while he still inhabited Gotama 's flesh , he allowed others to create the sangha in order to alleviate for the chosen few some of life 's pain . At first only men could be admitted to the order . But then Ananda persuaded the Buddha that women should be admitted too . They would live in their own communities , and follow the eightfold path . Although the Buddha was complaisant , he did make a joke , much quoted by misogynists . " Had the order been made up only of men , Ananda , it would have lasted a thousand years . Now that women have been included , it will last only five hundred years . " In either case , I suspect he was unduly optimistic . Toward the end of the rainy season I accompanied Prince Jeta to the park which he may or may not have sold to the merchant Anathapindikafor the Buddha 's use . Here live a thousand monks , disciples , admirers . Many ascetics sleep out of doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quartered in a large building with a thatched roof . Not far from this monastery , a wooden hut had been erected on a low platform . Here on a mat sat the Buddha . Since the hut was built without walls , he lived in full view of the world . Sariputra welcomed us to the monastery . He moved like a boy , with a skipping step . He did not carry a parasol . The warm rain seemed never to bother him . " You 're in luck . Tathagata is in a mood to talk . We 're so glad for you . Since the full moon , he 's been silent . But not today . " Sariputra patted my arm . " I told him who you were . " If he expected me to ask him what the Buddha had had to say about the Persian ambassador , he was disappointed . I was ceremonious . " I look forward to our meeting . " I used the word upanishad , which means not just a meeting but a serious discussion about spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavilion that had been built on a platform approached by eight shallow steps  --  one for each part of the eightfold way ? At the first step , a tall heavyset yellow man greeted Sariputra , who then introduced him to us . " This is Fan Ch'ih , " said Sariputra . " He has come from Cathay to learn from the Buddha . " " It is not possible not to learn from the Buddha . " Fan Ch'ih spoke the Koshalan dialect even better than I , despite an accent that was rather worse . Since Fan Ch'ih and I were to become close friends , I will only note here that he had not come to India to learn from the Buddha ; he was on a trade mission from a small nation in southeast Cathay . Later he told me that he had come to the park that day in order to meet the Persian ambassador . He was as fascinated by Persia as I was by Cathay.  |p239We  followed Sariputra up the steps and into the hut , where all of those who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who remained seated on his mat . I could see why he was called the golden one . He was as yellow as any native of Cathay . Not only was he not Aryan , he was not Dravidian either . Obviously , some tribe from Cathay had crossed the Himalayas to sire the Gotama clan . The Buddha was small , slender , supple . He sat very straight , legs crossed beneath him . The slanted eyes were so narrow that one could not tell if they were open or shut . Someone described the Buddha 's eyes as being as luminous as the night sky in summer . I would not know . I never actually saw them . Pale arched eyebrows grew together in such a way that there was a tuft of hair at the juncture . In India this is considered a mark of divinity . The old man 's flesh was wrinkled but glowing with good health , and t he bare skull shone like yellow alabaster . There was a scent of sandalwoodabout him that struck me as less than ascetic . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either his head or his body . Occasionallyhe would gesture with the right hand . The Buddha 's voice was low and agreeable , and seemed to cost him no breath . In fact , in some mysterious way , he seemed not to breathe at all . I bowed low . He motioned for me to sit . I made a set speech . When I was finished , the Buddha smiled . That was all . He did not bother to answer me . There was an awkward moment . Then a young man suddenly asked , " 0 Tathagata , is it your view that the world is eternal and all other views false ? " " No , child , I do not hold the view that the world is eternal and all other views false . "  --  Chen , is it your view that the world is not eternal and all other views are false ? " No , child , I do not hold the view that the world is not eternal , and all other views are false . " The young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite , if the body was similar or not similar to the soul , if a holy man exists or does not exist after death , and so on . To each question the Buddha gave the youth the same answer or non-answer that he had given to the question whether or not the world was eternal . Finally the young man asked , " What objection , then , does Tathagata perceive t() each of these theories that he has not adopted any one of them ? " " Because , child , the theory that the world is eternal , is a jungle , ailderness , a puppet show , a writhing , and a chain forever attached to misery , pain , despair and agony  --  this view does not contribute to averrion , absence of desire , cessation , quiescence , knowledge , supreme wisdomand nirvana . " Is this lathagata 's answer to each question ? " The Buddha nodded . " ' Phis is the objection I perceive to these appar/ently conflicting theories , and that is why I have not adopted any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own ? " There was a pause . I must confess that the blood was suddenly high in my cheeks , and I felt as if I had the fever . I wanted , desperately , to know the answer or non-answer . " The Buddha is free from all theories . " The voice was mild . The eyes seemed to be looking not at us but upon some world or non-world that we could not comprehend . " There are things , of course , that I know . I know the nature of matter . I know how things come into being and I know how they perish . I know the nature of sensation . I know how it is that sensation comes , and how it goes . I know how perception begins and ends . How consciousness starts , only to stop . Since I know these things , I have been able to free myself from all attachment . The self is gone , given up , relinquished . " " But Tathagata , are you . . . is the priest who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reborn ? " " To say that he is reborn does not fit the case . " " Does that mean he is not reborn ? " " That does not fit the case either . " " Then is he both reborn and not reborn ? " " No . Simultaneity does not fit the case . " " I am confused , Tathagata . Either he is the one thing or the other or even both things at the same time , yet  --  " " Enough , child . You are confused because very often it is not possible to see what is right in front of you because you happen to be looking in the wrong direction . Let me ask you a question . If a fire was burning in front of you , would you notice it ? " " Yes , Tathagata . " " If the fire went out , would you notice that ? " " Yes , Tathagata . " " Now , then , when the fire goes out , where does it go ? to the east ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the question is to no point , Tathagata . When a fire goes out for lack of fuel to burn , it is . . . well , it is gone , extinct . " " You have now answered your own question as to whether or not a holy man is reborn or not reborn . The question is to no point . Like the fire that goes out for lack of fuel to burn , he is gone , extinct . " " I see , " said the young man . " I understand . " " Perhaps you begin to understand . " The Buddha looked in my direction . I can not say that he ever looked at me . " We often hold this discussion , " he said . " And I always use the image of the fire because it seems easy to understand . " There was a long silence . Suddenly Sariputra announced , " Everything subject to causation is ap241mirage . " There was another silence . By then I had forgotten every question that I had meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out . Prince Jeta spoke for me . " Tathagata , the ambassador from the Great King of Persia is curious to know how the world was created . " The Buddha turned those strange blind eyes toward me . Then he smiled . " Perhaps , " he said , " you would like to tell me . " The Buddha 's bared teeth were mottled and yellow , disconcertingly suggestive of fangs . I do n't know what I said . I suppose I described for him the simultaneouscreation of good and evil . Repeated my grandfather 's doctrines . Observed those narrow eyes which were aimed  --  there is no other verb  --  in my direction . When I had finished , the Buddha made a polite response . " Since no one can ever know for certain whether or not his own view of creation is the correct one , it is absolutely impossible for him to know if someone else 's is the wrong one . " Then he dropped the only important subject that there is . The next silence was the longest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the thatched roof , of the wind in the trees , of the monks chanting in the nearby monastery . Finally I remembered one of the many questions that I had intended to ask him : " Tell me , Buddha , if the life of this world is an evil , why then is the world ? " The Buddha stared at me . I think that this time he might actually have seen me , even though the light inside the hut was now as dim and as green as pond water when one opens one 's eyes below the surface . " The world is full of pain , suffering and evil . That is the first truth , " he said . " Comprehend that first truth , and the other truths will be evident . Follow the eightfold way and  --  " "  --  and nirvana may or may not extinguish the self . " There was a slight gasp from those present . I had interrupted the Buddha . Nevertheless , I persisted in my rudeness . " But my question is : Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , is that it causes pain to no purpose ? " The Buddha was benign . " My child , let us say that you have been fighting in a battle . You have been struck by a poisoned arrow . You are in pain . You are feverish . You fear death  --  and the next incarnation . I am nearby . I am a skilled surgeon . You come to me . What will you ask me to do ? " " Take out the arrow . " " Right away ? " " Right away . " " You would not want to know whose bow fired the arrow ? " " I would be curious , of course . " I saw t he direction that he was taking.  | " But would you want to know before I took out the arrow whether or not the archer was tall or short , a warrior or a slave , handsome or ill-favored ? " " No , but  --  " " Then , that is all that the eightfold way can offer you . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poison , which is this world . " " But once the arrow has been removed and I am cured , I might still want to know whose arrow struck me . " " If you have truly followed the way , the question will be immaterial . You will have seen that this life is a dream , a mirage , something produced by the self . And when the self goes , it goes . " " You are Tathagata  --  the one who has come and gone and come again . When you are here , you are here . But when you go , where do you go ? " " Where the fire goes when it 's gone out . My child , no words can define nirvana . Make no attempt to catch in a net of familiar phrases that which is and is not . Finally , even to contemplate the idea of nirvana is a proof that one is still on the near-side of the river . Those who have achieved that state do not try to name what is nameless . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal the flesh . Let us take a ride , if we can , on the ferryboat that goes to the far side . Thus we follow the middle way . Is this the right way ? " The Buddha 's smile was barely visible in the twilight . Then he said , " As the space of the universe is filled with countless wheels of fiery stars , the wisdom that transcends this life is abysmally profound . " " And difficult to comprehend , Tathagata , " said Sariputra , " even for those who are awake . " " Which is why , Sariputra , no one can ever comprehend it through awakening . " The two old men burst out laughing at what was obviously a familiar joke . I remember nothing more of that meeting with the Buddha . I think that before we left the park , we visited the monastery . I believe that I first met Ananda then . He was a small man whose life work was to learn by heart everything that the Buddha was reported to have said and done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said anything to me that he had not said a thousand times before . " No . He uses the same images over and over again . The only new thing  --  to me  --  was the paradox about awakening . " " But it was not new to Sariputra . " " Well , Sariputra sees him more than anyone else , and they tell each other complicated jokes . They laugh a good deal together . I do n't know at what . Although I am sufficiently advanced that I can smile at this world , I can not laugh at it just yet . "  | " But why is he so indifferent to the idea of creation ? " " Because he thinks it , literally , immaterial . The ultimate human task is to dematerialize the self . In his own case , he has succeeded . Now he has set up the wheel of the doctrine for others to turn as best they can . He himself is come  --  and he is gone . " Democritus finds these ideas easier to comprehend than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation is in flux and that what we take to be the real world is a kind of shifting dream , perceived by each of us in a way that differs from that of everyone else , as well as from the thing itself . But the absence of deity , of origin and of terminus , of good in conflict with evil . . . The absence of purpose , finally , makes the Buddha'struths too strange for me to accept . IN T H E L A S T WEEK O F the rainy season , the river flooded . The yellow waters rose , covered the quays , burst through the wooden stockade , half drowned the city . Those who had tall houses like Prince Jeta simply moved to the upper stories . But those whose houses were on a single level were forced to move onto their roofs . Fortunately , the palace enclave was on a slightly higher ground than the rest of the city , and my own quarters were flooded only to the depth of an ankle . On the second day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly our meal was interrupted by a series of blasts on a conch shell . Then we heard the ominous sounds of metal striking metal . Since floods and civil disobedience go together in India , we were all agreed that those who had been dispossessed by the river had suddenly attacked the palace . Attended by Persian guards , we hurried to the palace . I remember how the hot wind blew the rain in our eyes . I remember the slipperiness of the mud beneath our feet . I remember our surprise when we found that the garden entrance to the palace was unguarded.  |p244Swords  drawn , we entered the vestibule , which was waist-deep in water . Although there was no one in sight , we could hear shouts in other parts of the building . At the entrance to the reception hall , we saw an amazing sight . The king 's guards were fighting one another  --  but very slowly , because the water hampered their movements . As we watched this curious dreamlike battle , the doors to the hall were flung open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons lowered for attack . At the sight of the spear carriers , the guardsmen sheathed their swords . In silence , the fighting stopped . In silence , King Pasenadi appeared in the doorway ; he had a long chain about his neck , which an officer of his own guard held in one hand . In the watery silence , the rhythmic clatter of the king 's chain made the sort of harsh music that Vedic gods delight in . As the king passed us , I bowed . But he did not see me . In fact , no one paid the slightest attention to the Persian embassy . Once the king was out of sight , I waded to the door of the reception hall and saw a dozen dead soldiers floating in the red-streaked yellow water . At the far end of the room , the throne had been overturned and several men were trying to put it back onto the dais . One of the men was Virudhaka . When Virudhaka saw me , he left to the others the task of righting the silver chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one end of his wet cloak . I remember thinking how odd it was for a man drenched in blood and river water to want to dry his sweaty face with a wet cloth . " As you see , Lord Ambassador , we are quite unprepared for cere-mony . " I dropped to one knee . I had seen quite enough to know what was expected of me . " May the gods grant long life to King Virudhaka . " Caraka and Fan Ch'ih also recited this pious hope . Virudhaka 's response was grave . " What the gods have given me this day , I shall do my best to prove worthy of . " There was a crash as the throne again slipped off the dais . All in all , not the best beginning to a reign . " It has been my father 's wish to abdicate for some years . " Virudhaka spoke smoothly . " This morning he sent for me , and he begged me to let him surrender the burden of this world . And so , today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , granted his wish and taken his place . " Obviously , the Buddha 's insistence that this world is a dream had had an effect not only on Virudhaka but on the entire court . No one ever referred , in my presence at least , to the bloody overthrow of Pasenadi . On the few occasions when his name was mentioned , it was said that he had gone into a much longed for retirement in the forest . He was said to be absolutely content ; there were even rumors that he had achieved nirvana.  |p245In  actuality , later that same day Pasenadi was hacked into a number of small pieces , which were then offered as a sacrifice to the river god . Since the river promptly returned to its banks , the sacrifice was plainly acceptable . Not long after , Prince Jeta and I met in a crowded street where the air was so filled with dust from the dried river mud that we were obliged to hold dampened cloths to our faces ; and took shallow breaths . As we strolled toward caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , but at the last moment he always changed his mind . Another month , ' he would say . Obviously he stayed one month too long . " " Obviously . But he was so old . Why did n't . . . he wait ? " In India , it is always a good idea to substitute pronouns for great names . " Fear . He is a devout man , and even though it was plain to him that his father was destroying Koshala , he was willing to wait . But when Ajatashatru seized power in Magadha , he knew that there would be war . So he did what he felt he had to do , to save what is left of the kingdom . " We stopped at a booth filled with odd-looking glazed pottery from Cathay , recently introduced by Fan Ch'ih . " Do you approve of what he did ? " Prince Jeta sighed . " How can I ? I am a Buddhist . I do not believe in hurting any living thing . Also , the ... dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince Jeta pointed at a dragon-headed pot  --  " I am told that there are many creatures like that in Cathay . " " So Fan Chi'ih tells me . The best medicine is made from dragon 's bone . " I waited for an answer to my question . Prince Jeta bought the pot . " If anyone can save this country from Ajatashatru , it is the new king , " he said . " What was the Buddha 's reaction ? " " The Buddha laughed  --  like a lion . " " He is not compassionate . " " How can he be ? He has come and gone . Kings are simply a part of that distracting puppet show that the perfect one no longer attends . " During the hot season , Ambalika arrived from Rajagriha with our son . Prince Jeta offered his granddaughter and great-grandson a wing of the river mansion , and I moved in with them . Meanwhile , a message had come to me from Susa by way of Taxila . The Great King denounced me for having paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had reopened the old trade route between Persia and Magadha , he was more pleased than not with his slave and I was a hero at court , or so the letter from the chancellor for the east implied . I was to come home immediately . Carefully , I made my plas . I ordered ( : uraka back to Rajagriha ,  |p246where  he would act as business agent for the Great King . He would also prepare a second caravan of iron from Magadha , at a more reasonable price than the one that I had agreed to . Ambalika and our son would remain in Shravasti until I sent for them , or until I returned myself . To everyone 's pleased surprise , the war between Magadha and Koshaladid not take place . Although Ajatashatru sent troops to Varanasi , he did not try to seize the city . Meanwhile , Virudhaka led the Koshalan army not south to his own beleaguered city of Varanasi , but east to the Shakya republic . In a matter of days , the republic collapsed and its territory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a war footing . All in all , I was happy to be going back to Persia , where battles take place at a considerable distance from Susa , and the high crime of parricideis virtually unknown amongst our Aryans . Although I found it curiously abominable that India 's two most powerful Aryan kings should be murdered by their sons , Prince Jeta seemed not at all perturbed . " We have an old saying , Princes , like crabs , eat their own parents . ' " Ultimately my embassy to the Indian kingdoms was conductedmost bloodily in the astrological sign of the crab . Practically speaking , I found Virudhaka much easier to deal with than his father . For one thing , he was a superb administrator and , briefly , Koshala was again what it must have been in those great days that everyone so enjoyed telling me about . But then , I have never visited any city in the world where I was not told that I had just missed the golden age . I seem never to be on time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient ritual that took place in a fairground just outside the city . I do n't remember much about the elaborate ceremonies except that they seemed a bit hurried . I do recall the magical moment when the new king took three steps on a tiger skin , in imitation of the three steps that the god Vishnu took when he crossed creation and filled the universe with light . Ananda says that the Buddha did the same thing shortly after his enlightenment . But as far as I can tell , the Buddha himself never seems to have mentioned this remarkable tour of the universe to anyone except Ananda . It was my , perhaps mistaken , impression that the Buddha was not given to such exaggerated gestures . Although Virudhaka had begged the Buddha to attend his investiture , the perfect one had seen fit to leave Shravasti the night before . He was last seen on the road to the land of the Shakyas . It was later said that the Buddha knew that the king intended to attack his native country and that he wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , when I asked Prince Jeta if this theory was true , he shook his head . " The Buddha would not have cared one way or the other . All attempts to involve him in politics failed . To the end , he laughed at the puppet show . It 's true that the Shakyas thought that he might help savep247them because he seemed to approve of their sangha . Perhaps he did . But it was not the Shakyan but the Buddhist sangha that interested him  --  if anything did . " This conversation took place during my last visit to India . With sufficientluck , Democritus , you will live long enough to be able to say of something that it is the last , and know for certain that what you have said is simple truth . I shall never again look upon scarlet parrots , yelloweyedtigers , sky-clad madmen . I shall never again travel in that hot flat land where swift pale rivers rise and fall , and there is always a crossing to be made . " Why did Virudhaka attack the Shakyas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He wished to avenge the insult to his father . As an arhat , Pasenadi was obliged to forgive the Shakyans for sending him a prostitute for a wife . As a warrior , Virudhakacould never forgive this insult . " " But there must be some other reason . " I never accept the official reason for anything . In the second room of the chancellery at Susa , I have myself invented altogether too many noble pretexts for necessary if ugly actions . " Virudhaka feared the republics as much as Ajatashatru . I suppose he thought that if he were to break them first , he would be more powerful than his cousin . Who knows ? Virudhaka had no luck . " But on coronation day Virudhaka seemed blessed by heaven . For one thing , just after he took the last of his three steps on the tiger skin , all the gods came down from heaven and up from hell to greet him , and the crowds cheered this charming spectacle . " Here comes Vishnu , " said Prince Jeta . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal man , the god Vishnu loomed over the heads of the excited mob . The god 's handsome face was blue-black , and he wore a tall elaborate headdress . In one hand he held a lotus , like the Great King . In the other he carried a conch shell . I was relieved that he had not chosen to wear his other two arms that day . While Vishnu slowly walked toward the tiger skin where Virudhaka stood , the people fell prostrate . Many of them wriggled toward him in order to touch the hem of his robe . Suddenly the fairground seemed to be full of humanheadedsnakes . Just behind Vishnu was his wife Lakshmi . The goddess ' nipples had been painted vermilion , and the golden skin shone with ghee , as do her statues at the city 's gate . As the two high gods adorned Virudhaka with wreaths , the ecstatic crowd began to howl and dance like haoma-drunk Magians . " What on earth are they ? " I asked Prince Jeta . " On earth , as in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was amused at my bewilderment . Caraka laughed too . " Your Vishnu has been in India too long , " he saidp248to Prince Jeta . " He 's the same color as one of our old gods . " " I 'm sure that they are all related . " Prince Jeta 's politeness required a change of subject . " Naturally , this is a very rare occasion . Only once or twice in a generation will a king summon all the gods to his side . " As Prince Jeta spoke , the baleful red-faced Indra materialized at the far end of the field . In one hand he held a thunderbolt ; in the other he clutched a huge flask of soma , from which he swigged . Nearby , all in black , eyes ablaze , stood Agni in a chariot drawn by fire-red horses . Brilliantly , eerily , from every direction , the Vedic gods solemnly converged upon King Virudhaka . Prince Jeta was not entirely sure of my reaction . Nor was I , even to this day . Had I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present ? It is possible . Certainly , the performance was awesome . But it was only a performance , as Prince Jeta assured me . " The gods , " he said , " are being impersonated by actors . " " But these actors are giants ! " " Each god is actually two actors . One sits on the shoulders of the other and the robes cover both of them . The effect is convincing , is n't it ? " " And alarming . " I had the sense that I was in a haoma-dream . " Do the people really believe that these are their gods ? " Prince Jeta shrugged . " Some do . Some do n't . " " Most do , " said Caraka . He turned to Prince Jeta . " You Aryans got the idea from us . At the New Year , when our people come to the temples to make sacrifice , all the gods appear . They threaten the people with plague and famine . So to avoid disaster , the temple priests beg the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a really good performance , a temple 's revenue can double . " " In that case , was it Brahma or a couple of actors who came to see the Buddha in the deer park ? " I teased Prince Jeta . " I would n't know . I was not there . " The answer was serene . " But then , neither was the Buddha , since he was already extinguished . So Brahma  --  or his impersonator  --  was wasting his time . " I must confess that those huge deities moving about the crowded fairground had a most unnerving effect on me . In a sense , all my grandfather'schief devils were being impersonated , and I saw what a Zoroastrianhell might be like . But Ambalika enjoyed herself hugely . " They seem so real ! Which is just as good as being real , is n't it ? " She had attended the coronation in the entourage of the old queen . Ambalika was somewhat plumper than she had been before my son was born . " I 'm not too heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her greeting to me when I met her at the city 's gate . In a tactless moment I had once complained to her that everyone at the court of Magadha was too fat , including myself . In three years , I had nearly doubled my weight . " No . You are exactly right . "  | " If I 'm not , tell me . " We were in the main garden of Prince Jeta 's house . " I 'll tell you . " I was entirely delighted by Ambalika . I told her so . " Then you 'll let me come to Susa ? " " If I can . " " Because I 'm certain you 'll never come back here . " Ambalika looked sad but sounded cheerful . I told her that I was certain to come back for the prosaic reason that " there is bound to be more trade between Persia and Magadha . Koshala , too . " This proved to be true . In fact , before I left Shravasti , I was approachedby every important merchant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down several fortunes in bribes , I did accept a retainer 's fee from the potters ' guild in the form of a loan without interest . The loan itself would be paid off by the guild if I saw to it that Persian imports of Indian pottery were not taxed . I made this arrangement so that Ambalika and my children  --  she was again pregnant  --  would be taken care of in case Prince Jeta should die or be disgraced . Naturally , I assumed that when I next saw my wife and children , I would be with the lord of all India , Darius the Great King . In the autumn of that year , I attached myself to a westbound caravan . In addition to my personal guards , I was accompanied by Fan Ch'ih . All the other members of his original expedition had been killed or died of the fever or gone home . " The people of Cathay do n't like to travel . " Fan Ch'ih smiled his constant but never annoying smile . " Since Cathay is the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . " Because the days were dry and cool , we rode horseback . In fact , the weather was so splendid that one was absolutely happy to be young and alive  --  all in all , a rare sensation . During our journey to the west I learned a great deal about Cathay , which I shall come to in the proper place . I had expected to impress Fan Ch'ih with the splendors of the Persian empire . Instead , he impressed me with the magnificence  --  alleged , of course  --  of the Cathayan world , where once upon a time there had been a single empire known as the Middle Kingdom . But as empires will , this one broke up , and today Cathay is comprised of a number of contending states like India . Also , again like India , these states are not only constantly at war with one another but there is not a duke or marquis or earl in his fortress who does not dream of one day making himself the single master of a recreatedMiddle Kingdom . " But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  receives the mandate of heaven . "  |p250I  remember hearing that phrase for the first time at the same momentthat I saw the dreamlike towers of Taxila in the hazy violet distance . Usually the traveler smells a city before he sees it . This time one saw the towers first , then smelled the cook-fires ' smoke . " We call the mandate of heaven , the awesome royal glory , " I said . " One of our old devil-gods was its sole bestower and he , and he alone , could give the glory to a ruler , just as he alone could take it away . Now we know that it is not a devil-god but the Wise Lord who bestows or withholds the awesome royal glory . " " Master K'ung would say that the bestower was heaven , which is the same thing , is n't it ? " A few years later I was to meet Master K'ung , and of all men that I have known , he was the wisest . Take my word for it , Democritus . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the only man in the western world who ever knew this remarkable teacher . No , Master K'ung  --  or Confucius , as he is also called  --  was not like Protagoras . Confucius was not clever . He was wise . Eventually I shall try to explain the difference between the two . But my best may not be enough . After all , Greek is the language of the hair-splitter and the debate-winner ; it is not the language of the God , as opposed to gods.  |p253ARRIVED  AT SUSA , FOURyears less three days after I had set out on my embassy to the sixteen kingdoms of India , a perfect misnomer even at the time of my departure . In the Gangetic plain there were fewer than sixteen kingdoms , and no one has ever bothered to count how many nations there are to the south . The chancellery agreed with me that future ambassadors would be posted only to the kings of Magadha and Koshala . Although the court was still at Susa , Darius himself had moved on to winter quarters at Babylon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already begun its slow progress by wagon to the west . Of the royal family , only Xerxes was in residence . During my absence the harem war had ended with an outright victoryfor Atossa , as if there had ever been any real doubt . Except for making me chief Zoroastrian , she almost never failed in anything that she undertook . She had obliged Darius to recognize Xerxes as his heir , and that was that . I was received by the crown prince in the private quarters . As I was about to fall prostrate Xerxes caught me with his left arm and we embraced like brothers . Looking back , I now realize how fortunate we were . Each was in his prime . Unfortunately , each was unaware of the fact . I was weary of travel . Xerxes was weary of Mardonius . No man ever knows when he is happy ; he can only know when he was happy . We drank Helbon wine while I told Xerxes of my adventures in India . 1 le was enthralled . " I must lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat 's . " The Great King 's too old . He 'll have to send me . Except "  --  the brows that normally met in a straight line now formed a cleft  --  " he wo n't . He 'll send Mardonius . " " You could both go . And Mardonius would serve under you . " " If I 'm allowed to go . " The light in the gray eyes went out . " He gets everything . I get nothing . He has had a hundred victories . I 've had none ' . " " You conquered Babylon , " I said . " Or you were about to just before I left . "  | " I put down a rebellion , nothing more . But when I asked to be made king of Babel like Cambyses , the Great King said no . He said it was quite enough for me to administer Babylonia , which I do . I 've also built a new palace , which I 'm allowed to stay in only when he 's not there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xerxes liked his father . I suspect that he did not . Certainly , he resented the confusion over the succession , and he took as a deliberate insult the fact that he was never given a military command of any importance . Yet he was entirely loyal to Darius ; and feared him just as Darius feared Atossa . " Why are you here so late in the season ? " I asked . In private we always spoke directly to each other , and looked each other in the eye . " Cold , is n't it ? " The room was freezing . There 's no city in the world with such abrupt shifts in weather as Susa . The previous day had been positively sultry . Yet that very morning when I crossed from my quartersin the north section of the palace to Xerxes ' apartments , the ornamentalpools had been covered with thin layers of iridescent night-ice and my breath hovered like smoke in the bright air . I could understand how the aging Darius came to abhor cold weather ; at the first hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the Great King 's chief mason . " Xerxes held up his hands . The short nails were impacted with cement . " He was so pleased with the palace that I built in Babylon  --  for me , not for him  --  that he 's put me in charge of finishing this one . He 's also given me a free hand at Persepolis . So I build and build . Spend and spend . I 've replaced most of the Egyptian builders with Ionian Greeks . They 're the best at stonework . I 've even got some of your Indians as wood-carvers . I 've accumulatedjust about everything , except money . Darius doles it out , a sheep 's worth at a time . I do n't think I 've seen an archer since the Greek wars . " That was the first time I heard the slang word archer , the name the Greeks give to the gold coin that shows the crowned Darius holding a bow in one hand . Current Persian joke : No Greek is impervious to a Persian archer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I was in India . I say his version because there is no such thing as a true account of anything . Each sees the world from his own vantage point . Needless to say , a throne is not the best place from which to see anything except the backs of prostrate men . " After a long siege , Miletus fell . We killed the men . We shipped the women and children here to Susa . The Great King plans to settle them somewhere nearby so , till then , we 've got several thousand very attractiveyoung Milesians living in the old barracks . Take your pick . They 've pretty much stopped their weeping and wailing . In fact , I 've establishedone young widow in my harem . She 's teaching me Greek , orp255trying to . She 's clever , like all Milesians . " This clever lady was the aunt of Aspasia . We must keep that a secret , Democritus . The Athenians would ostracizePericles if they knew that the mother of his illegitimate son was the niece of the Great King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wit to figure out the connection . They would n't . But Thucydides would . A cold wind rattled the awning that had not yet been taken down for the winter . Through the open portico I could see brown leaves whirling . I thought of my school days in that same palace , and I shivered ; it seemed always to be winter when I was a child at Susa . " After we took Miletus , a group of Medes  --  who else ?  --  set fire to the temple of Apollo at Didyma and burned the whole thing to the ground , oracle and all . Then that idiot Artaphrenes sent a message to all the Greek cities saying that the burning of the temple was in revenge for the burning of the temple of Cybele at Sardis . " " But was n't it ? " " Brother of my youth , the priesthood of Apollo at Didyma , the priesthoodof Apollo at Delos , the priesthood of Apollo at Delphi are all supported by the Great King . Each year he sends them divisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for the Greek oracle at Delphi . No , we do not . The wars are over now . Besides , the priests learned their lesson . Nowadays , oracles seldom comment on political ' natters . " Anyway , the Great King has been making apologies ever since . He 'll also have to pay to rebuild the temple . And that means less money for Persepolis . " In those days , Xerxes could drink half a dozen flagons of unmixed Helbon wine at a sitting without ill effect . On the other hand , even in my youth I always mixed wine with water  --  like a Greek . Xerxes ordered the cupbearer to bring us more wine . He then describedthe collapse of the Carian revolt . " After Miletus fell , that was the end for those yokels . What else ? Histiaeus was captured and put to death by the idiot at Sardis , which made the Great King angry because the liked Histiaeus and never blamed him for any of the Milesian business . But of course the charge against the old conniver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pirate during the last years of his life . Your mother was very upset when he was executed . " Xerxes always found my mother 's intrigues amusing . " They were n't friends after Miletus rebelled . Or so I gathered . I would n't really know . " I was always careful to distance myself from the Greek faction . " Only in the sense that they never saw each other again . But they were still devoted to each other . " Xerxes grinned . " I know , " he saidp256and , of course , he did . Xerxes had a dozen spies in the harem  --  unlike Darius , who tended to ignore harem intrigues unless they involved Atossa . Needless to say , Darius spied on her constantly and she spied on him . They were like neighboring sovereigns . " After Miletus , we sent the fleet up the Ionian coast . The Greek cities surrendered . Then our fleet  --  mostly Phoenicians now  --  passed through the straits , and the local tyrant was so alarmed that he went home to Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great King 's most loyal vassals , he was perfectly safe . Now he 's a traitor . " Thus , casually , Democritus , did Xerxes refer to Miltiades , a minor Persian vassal who less than three years later was elected supreme commander by the Greek allies . He is given credit for the so-called Greek victory at Plataea . Democritus tells me that Miltiades was not at Plataea , but at Marathon . Small details like this are no doubt important to a Greek history . This is a Persian history . " Then , last spring , Mardonius was given command of both the fleet and the army . " Since Xerxes loved Mardonius like a brother , Mardonius ' success was all the more unbearable to him . " In less than six months Mardonius conquered Thrace and Macedonia . Not since Cambyses gave us Egypt has anyone added so much territory to the empire . It 's lucky for me that he is the Great King 's nephew and not his son . " " Why are n't you given the same opportunities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the traditional gesture of homage to the Great King on state occasions . " My life is too valuable , they say . But how am Ito be Great King myself if I 've never taken the field ? Oh , I need victories ! I need to be like Mardonius . Only ... " Xerxes ' arm fell to the table . The open palm became a fist . " Queen Atossa ? " " Yes . Thanks to her , I am the heir . And thanks to her , I am less than my cousin , less than my brothers , less than you . " " You are certainly more than I. " " Well , yes , of course . But I have n't seen India , and you have . And because of you , we 're now in a position to annex a whole world . Well , let 's pray that that will be my work . Let 's also pray that Darius allows Mardonius to go on fighting the Greeks , which Mardonius wants to do . I ca n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want . " Does n't the Great King want to avenge the burning of Sardis ? " " Any one of a hundred generals could manage that . All you have to do is burn down Athens . That 's easy . And pointless . But India ! " Xerxes was happier for all the wine he had drunk . He gripped my forearm ; his fingers were roughened from military practice . " When you report to the Great King , tell him that I must  --  well , no , you ca n't tell him that he must do anything but ... " " I can hint . I can also speak to Queen Atossa. "  | " Do n't . She 'll want me safe in Babylon . " " If she thought that the conquest of the Indian kingdoms would be easy , she would let you go . She 's not a fool , to say the least . " Xerxes used a dagger 's tip to clean the mortar from under a thumbnail . " She might be helpful . It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I go , you 'll come with me . " Happily , we plotted glory , as the young do ; an exquisite pleasure denied the old when all plots are at an end , like the spider 's web when the spider 's dead . " If we 're lucky , we 'll have set things in motion before Mardonius is tip and around . " Xerxes suddenly nicked his thumb . Bright blood made two tiny red pearls . He licked the blood away . " Is Mardonius ill ? " " Wounded . " Xerxes tried not to look pleased . " He was ambushed on his way back from Macedonia . By Thracians . A leg tendon was severed . So now he limps about , full of complaints even though he sits every day at the Great King 's table . Sits at his right hand when I 'm not there , and Darius feeds him from his own plate . " " But if he 's wounded , that 's the end of the Greek business . " I always slid my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his father 's indifference to him . But , no , indifference is not the right word . Darius saw Xerxes as an extension of Atossa , daughter of Cyrus ; and Darius was not only in awe of his wife and her son but fearful of them . I shall soon come to the reason for this . " It should be the end . Certainly , there 's nothing else for us in the west except Mardonius ' ambition to be satrap of all the Greeks . Luckily , he 's not fit for a spring campaign . And I am . So with a bit of . . . good fortune "  --  Xerxes used the Greek phrase  --  " I shall lead the Persian army this spring . And we 'll go east , not west . " Xerxes then spoke of women . He found the subject endlessly interesting . He wanted to know all about Amnbalika . I told him . We agreed that my son should be brought up at the Persian court . Xerxes then told me about his principal wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Atossa . At first , I did n't know why . " " Because of Otanes ' money , I should 've thought . " " That was a consideration . But Atossa is deeper than that . Atossa chose Amestris because Amestris is like Atossa . " Xerxes smiled without much pleasure . " Amestris studies all the accounts . She administers my household . She spends hours with the eunuchs , and you know what that means . " " She is political ? " " She is political . Atossa wants to make sure that after she dies , I 'll be looked after by yet another Atossa . Naturally , I revere my mother . Because of her , I am the heir . " " The eldest living grandson of Cyrus was bound to be the heir . "  | " I have two younger brothers . " Xerxes did not need to say more . It had always been his fear that he would be superseded not by Artobazanesbut by one of his own royal brothers . After all , when Darius became Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a grandfatherliving . Admittedly , this anomalous situation is not apt to recur in Persian history ; even so , there are still many precedents for the passing over of the eldest son in favor of a younger one : witness my current master , Artaxerxes . " We must get you a Persian wife . " Xerxes changed the dangerous subject . " You must marry one of my sisters . " " I ca n't . I 'm not one of The Six . " " I do n't think that the rule applies to the royal girls . We 'll ask the law-bearers . " Xerxes finished the last flagon of wine . He yawned contentedly . " The law-bearers will also have to pick a wife for that Indian . . . ? " " Ajatashatru . " Xerxes grinned . " I shall personally go to his wedding . " " That would be a great honor for Magadha . " " I 'll also attend his funeral , an even greater honor . " The next day we left Susa in a hailstorm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was not in the least distressed , but Xerxes always regarded bad weather as a sign of heaven 's spite and he was forever trying to find some way of punishing the rain or the wind . " What is the point to being lord of the universe , " he used to say , " if you ca n't go hunting because of a storm ? " I tried to teach him serenity , without much luck . Once I even went so far as to describe the Buddha to him . Xerxes laughed at the four noble truths . I was irritated . I ca n't think why . I had found the Buddha himself a chilling , even dangerous figure . But one could hardly fault those noble truths which are obvious . " Are they so amusing ? " " Your Buddha is . Does n't he know that wanting not to want is still wanting ? His truths are n't noble . They are n't even true . He has no answer to anything . There is no way not to be human except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . Southwest of the crumbling row of red sandstone hills that marks the natural end of Susa 's countryside , the weather became warm and mild ; and Xerxes ' temper promptly improved . By the time we got to Babylon even he could not fault heaven 's arrangements . Shortly before midnight we were at the city 's gates . Tactfully but inaccurately the guards hailed Xerxes as king of Babel . Then , with a roaring sound , the great cedarwood gates swung open and we entered the sleeping city . On either side of the broad avenue that leads to the new palace , the tiny thornfires of the poor shone like earthbound stars . Wherever one is on earth , they are there.  |p259SINCE  I HAD EXPLOREDa world that no one at court had ever heard of , much less seen , I felt that my return would cause a good deal of excitement and I was rather looking forward to being a center of attention . I should have known better . The court is all that matters to the court . My absence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , Fan Ch'ih 's appearance made people laugh . Fortunately , he was not distressed . " They look very odd to me , too , " he said serenely . " They also smell very bad  --  like old ghee . I suppose that 's because they have so much hair on their bodies . They look like monkeys . " Since the bodies of the yellow men of Cathay are almost entirely hairless , their sweat has a most curious odor , like boiled oranges . I reported to the first room of the chancellery . Nothing had changed there . I was sent to the second room , where the same eunuchs sat at the same long tables , keeping accounts , writing letters in the Great King 's name , conducting the tedious business of the empire . The fact that I had been to India interested them not at all . An under-chamberlain told me that I might be received in private audience by the Great King quite soon . But then again . . . The Persian court is eternal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look much older , " she said . Then we embraced . As usual , she asked me no questions about myself . She was not interested in India either . " You must go see your old friend Mardonius . Right away . He 's absolutely the most powerful man at court . " Lais responded to power in rather the same way that a waterdiviner'srod will bend if it detects the slightest moisture beneath the earth . " Darius dotes on him . Atossa is furious . But what can she do ? " " Poison him ? " I suggested . " She would if she thought she could get away with it . But as I keep telling her , Mardonius is no real threat . How can he be ? He 's not the Great King 's son . ' Nephews have inherited before , ' she says . She 's lost four teeth this year . ' l'hey just fell out . But if you ca n't understand what she 's saying , do n't let on . Pretend you 've understood every word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you like Xerxes ' palace ? " We were on the roof of Lais ' apartment in the new palace . To the north , just past the ziggurat , Xerxes ' building loomed in all its goldglazedsplendor . " Yes , what I 've seen of it . I 've only been to the chancellery . " " The interior is beautiful . And comfortable . Darius likes it so much that poor Xerxes has been obliged to move back here when the court 's at Babylon , which it is more and more . " Lais lowered her voice . " He 's aged . " Lais gave me her secret witch-look . In her world nothing is natural . If Darius had aged , it was not time 's usual work but a magical spell or potion . With a rustling sound , Lais ' ancient eunuch appeared in the doorway . He looked at her . He looked at me . He looked at her again . He withdrew . They knew each other so well that they could communicate without words or signs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous . " I hope you 'll like him as much as I do . " " I 've always liked your Greeks . Where is this one from ? Sparta ? " Lais has never liked the fact that I can see through her in much the same way that she claims that she can see through others . After all , I am the grandson of the holiest man that ever lived , as well as the son of a sorceress . I have powers denied the ordinary . Democritus has asked for a demonstration of these powers . I am giving you one . My memory . The Greek was not much older than I. But then , my mother is not much older than I. He was tall . He had a pale face and Dorian-blue eyes . Except for sandals instead of shoes , he wore Persian dress , and looked most uncomfortable . I had guessed right . He was Spartan . How could I tell ? The dark-red hair that fell to his shoulders had never been washed except by the rain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reverent . " King of Sparta . " " King no longer . Son of Ariston no longer . Thanks to Delphi . " " The prophetess has been removed . " Lais sounded as if she herself had been responsible for the change . " Too late for me . " At the time I had not the slightest notion what they were talking about . Later I came to know altogether too much about the so-called Spartan Scandal  --  a somewhat inapposite title when one considers how many scandals there are in Sparta every year , usually involving bribed officials . Of all the Greeks , the Spartans are the most archer-mad . The Spartan constitution requires not one but two kings , a stupid arrangement . Demaratus fell out with the other king , Cleomenes , who bribed the prophetess at Delphi to say that Demaratus was not the sonp261of Ariston . Once Demaratus had been proved illegitimate , he was king no longer . Hippias had told us that day at Darius ' hunting lodge that this would happen ; but Hippias had not been believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oracle could prove who had sired whom so many years after the act . But the oracle prevailed , and like every other discredited Greek king or tyrant or general , Demaratus promptly came up to Susa , where Darius took him in . Demaratus was given lands in The Troad , and made a general . We exchanged the usual civilities . Then with a sense of having lived through all of this before with Histiaeus , I said , " You are now trying to persuade the Great King to attack Athens in the spring . When Athens falls , will you want the Great King to conquer Sparta , too ? " " Only Athens , " said Demaratus . I noticed that the cold blue eyes were the same color as the glazed blue tiles of the Ishtar Gate just opposite us . " The Spartan army is stronger than the Persian army . " " No army is stronger than the Great King 's ! " Lais said nervously . " Except Sparta 's , " said Demaratus . " That is a fact . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire his feet . He wore open sandals that revealed toes as black as a Babylonian peasant 's . Trying to look at neither feet nor hair , I ended by staring at Demaratus ' beard . It was so thick with old dust that it looked to be made of baked clay . " Without allies , Sparta is vulnerable , " I said . " Sparta depends on the Athenian fleet . But if Athens falls ... " I did not state the obvious . Demaratus gave me a murderous look . Then , irritably , he pushed back the long Persian sleeves . " Eretria , Euboea and Athens . Those are the Great King 's targets for the coming year . The matter of Sparta is something else , and will be settled by Spartans . Meanwhile , Mardonius will lead the army again . " Lais looked at me as if I should be pleased . I looked at her in order to remind her that our faction was not that of Mardonius and the Greeks but of Xerxes and Atossa . " Are you certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was answered by Lais . " No , " she said . " The physicians say that he 'll never walk again . " " Mardonius is the Great King 's best general . " Demaratus was flat . " If he has to , he can lead the expedition in a litter . But he wo n't have to . I 've seen the leg . It will heal . " " If it does n't "  --  and Lais looked suddenly grave and sibylline  --  " there is no reason why a Spartan king could not lead the army . " I ) einaratus ' black toes clenched like two fists . I looked away . " There is a very good reason why I could not lead the army . " The voice was oddly mild . " I am not Persian  --  yet . " hater that day I.ais and I had a furious quarrel . I told her that the lastthing iii the world " you and I should want is anotIier Greek expedition . " " Our future is in the west , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year or two . What difference will it make ? Xerxes is still going to be Great King one day , and when he is , thanks to Mardoniusor Demaratus , he will be the lord of all the Greeks from Sigeum to Sicily , and sea lord , too . " Lais and I were now on different sides . In fact , after that day we did not speak to each other again for several years . Since I supported Xerxes , I did my best to bend Persian policy to the east , while Lais continued to receive all the Greeks at court in order to support their numerous causes . Yet she kept warm her friendship with Atossa . Years later , when Lais and I were on better terms , she told me how she had managed to stay in with both factions . " I convinced Atossa that I was poisoning Mardonius . Very slowly , of course , so that when he died everyone would blame his death on the leg that would n't heal . " " But what did Atossa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was replaced as general , I said to her , What 's the point to killing him ? ' and she agreed that there was none . So I stopped the so-called poisoning . " Shortly after my meeting with Demaratus I was received by Atossa , who deplored the fact that I had turned on Lais . " After all , your mother saved your life . " " You saved my life , Great Queen . " " True . But I did it for Lais . How I hate this city . " Although the third house of the harem of Xerxes ' palace was more sumptuous than its equivalent at Susa , Atossa complained constantly of the heat , the noise , the Babylonians  --  not that she ever saw any Babylonians other than those who had always been at court . " Naturally , I am pleased with you . " Atossa 's speech had indeed been impaired by the recent loss of several crucial teeth . She compensated for this disability by pursing and smacking her enameled lips in a most distracting way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xerxes . I know that you quarreledwith your mother about the Greeks and Mardonius . Mardonius  --  " She checked herself . I suspect now that she was tempted to tell me that her brilliant nephew Mardonius would soon be dead , thanks to Lais . But if that was the moment 's temptation , she did not yield to it . Instead , Atossa kicked at the old tattered rug with one bright silver shoe . Wherevershe went , the old rug traveled with her . I think that she was superstitious about it . I know that I was . Atossa addressed the rug . " They say that Mardonius will not be able to take the field this spring . " Then she looked straight at me . " Tell me about India . " I told her about India . The old eyes shone with greed . " Rich , rich ! " she kept repeating . " And easily gained , " I said . " By Xerxes. "  | " He can not be risked . " Atossa was firm . " He must prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies . " " Too dangerous . Especially now . In these times . We are all so old . Oh , the tomb ! " Because of the impairment to her speech , the queen was particularly hard to follow when she shifted too quickly the subject . I looked at her dully . " The tomb . The tomb of Darius . " She arranged her lips carefully about each syllable . " It 's enraging . " " The moon symbol ? " The devil symbol decorates the facade of Darius ' tomb , as a balance to the Wise Lord 's sun . Hystaspes had died at the tomb  --  in a rage at the blasphemy . Hystaspes is now in the tomb ; and the moon symbol is still on the facade . " That is as it should be . " Atossa detached a flower from the garland about her neck and threw it at the image of Anahita in the corner . " The moon is her symbol , and I would not lie under any other . No , something else has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tomb . Old I Iystaspes and two of Darius ' brothers are already there on one shelf . Then Darius and I and my sister Artystone will occupy another shelf , while six of the nephews are to fill the remaining two shelves . It was all worked out by Darius and me . Now , only this morning , Darius has assigned the place that was to have gone to young Artaphrenes to I'armys . To Parmys , of all people ! She died last week , by the way . Most painfully , I 'm told ! " Atossa pressed a thin yellow hand against the spot where her breast had been . " Yes , the same sickness . But I had Democedes . And survived . She had only Egyptians . And died , most painfully . They say that at the end she weighed less than a year-old child . " This pleasurable reverie was swiftly dispelled by the thought of Parmys " with us in that rock chamber for all eternity . Oh , I tell you it is intolerable ! And mysterious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is , why has he done the unthinkable ? Except to annoy me , which he has succeeded in doing . I can not bear to think that for all eternity I must lie beside the daughter of a murderer and a traitor and an impostor . " I must say that I had forgotten all about Parmys , the daughter of the Magian usurper Gaumata . Lais had told me how astonished the court had been when Darius announced that he intended to marry her . They were even more mystified by his explanation : " Impostor or not , the Magian was Great King for a year . Therefore , his daughter Parmys is t he ( laughter of a Great King of Persia . Therefore , it is suitable that she he my wife . " " You must promise me in the name of Anahita  --  well , of the Wise Lord  --  that when Darius is dead and I am dead you will persuade Xerxes to remove that dreadful woman from the tomb . Swear ! " As I swore , Atossa regarded me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing that I will be able to do about it in the flesh . But the goddess is strong . The goddess is everywhere . " Atossa 's red eyes glared at me . " I shall do what I can . But surely a word from you to Xerxes  --  " " He has received that word . But he is forgetful . He is also apt to be influenced by other considerations . " She did not elaborate . " So I count on you . On you alone . " Atossa had other complaints . She seldom saw Xerxes . When the court was at Susa or Ecbatana , he was either at Babylon or Persepolis . " He has a mania for building . " Atossa frowned . " So did my father , of course . But it is a very expensive hobby , as he discovered . And endless . " Over the years , I was to watch Xerxes create at Persepolis the most beautiful complex of unfinished buildings in the world . When Callias came to Persia for the peace negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was so awed by what Xerxes had built that he ordered one of his slaves to make drawings of the principal buildings . At this very moment , the Athenians are busily imitating Xerxes ' work . Fortunately , I have seen the originals . Fortunately , I shall never see Phidias ' crude copies . Atossa admitted to a certain loneliness , and isolation . " I have Lais , of course . But she is deranged by Greek politics . Ordinarily I 'm perfectly content with the eunuchs . After all , they 've been my eyes , my ears , my hands ever since I was a child . But this new crop is n't at all like the old . They are either too much like women or too much like men . I do n't know what 's gone wrong . In my father 's time , they were perfectly balanced and absolutely devoted . They knew what you wanted without being told . Now they are arrogant and dull and careless , and both rooms of the chancellery are a shambles . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks from Samos . They 're very good-looking , of course . Even intelligent . But they do n't make good eunuchs . They do n't make good anything at all , except troublemakers . You know that Lais is connivingagain . " " Yes . I 've met the king of Sparta . " " In the harem , Lais is known as the queen of Greece . No , I do n't mind . If it were n't for her , I 'd never know what those troublesome people are up to . " " What are they up to ? " On serious matters I asked Atossa direct questions , to which she sometimes gave direct answers . " They want a spring offensive . Athens is to be destroyed , and so on . The whole thing is absolutely useless , but Hippias  --  " " Always Hippias . " " Do n't interrupt . " " I was echoing , Great Queen . " " Do n't echo . Hippias has convinced Darius  --  again  --  that the Athenianswant him back as tyrant . Darius is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treason . She shouted it , knowing that the secret service would repeat every word to Darius . Thus they communicated with each other . Not until after Darius ' death did I learn why she did not fear him ; why he feared her . " Darius is muddled . He actually thinks that Athens wants to restore the tyrants now that all the other Greek cities have become democ-racies . " I was startled . " But surely the Ionian cities are  --  "  --  are all democracies now . The tyrants are gone , every last one of them . Thanks to Mardonius . At first , Darius was furious . But then he realized how clever Mardonius was . " Atossa 's eyes were like dusty enamel by torchlight . " Mardonius is clever . Too clever , I sometimes t funk . Anyway , as he went from city to city , he realized that the tyrants were unpopular because they were loyal to Persia . " " An excellent reason for retaining them . " " So I would have thought . But Mardonius is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the leading Greek merchants . You know , the sort of people who control the rabble when it gets together and starts voting . Then , suddenly , in the Great King 's name , Mardonius dismissed the t Tyrants . Just like that . Now he 's the hero of the Ionian democracies . Breath-taking , really . " " Although the tyrants are gone , I 'm sure that Mardonius left a queenin Ilalicarnassus . " This was the sort of thing that amused Atossa . " Oh , yes . Artemisia is still queen . She is also a beautiful widow . " " Actually , she 's a rather plain widow . " " All queens are to be regarded as beautiful , " said Atossa firmly . " Exccceptby their husbands . Anyway , now , thanks to Mardonius , Persia is in t he ridiculous position of being the sponsor of democracy in the Ionian cities while trying to overthrow the Athenian democracy in order to restore the tyranny .

" Atossa gave one of her remaining teeth an experimental tap and winced with pain . " It 's lucky or Mardonius that he conquered Thrace and Macedonia . Otherwise I ) ; trigs might have been very angry with him . As it is , Darius listens to t irdonius , and only to him . This season , anyway . And that means that there will be another Greek campaign , with or without Mardonius. l finless ... Tell me more about India . " ltossa was a highly practical and realistic politician . She knew that , . owner or later , Xerxes must prove himself in war , and in the light of Mardonius ' victories , sooner was better . Although Atossa had no fear of Xerxes ' failing to win battles  --  was he not Cyrus ' grandson ?  --  she feared that he might he murdered by the ( : obryas faction . She also knew thatp266it is far easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-guarded prince at a court . When I had finished , Atossa said the awesome words " I will speak to Darius . " In all the years that I knew her , I do n't suppose that I heard her use this phrase more than three times . It was like a declaration of war . Gratefully I kissed her hand . Once again we were fellow conspirators . I tried several times to see Mardonius , but he was too ill to receive me . The leg had turned gangrenous and there was talk of amputation . Everyone said what a shame it was that Democedes was no longer alive . Fan Ch'ih was delighted with Babylon . " There are at least six men from Cathay living here , and one is a partner of the Egibis . " All the world knows  --  except Democritus  --  that Egibi and sons are the richest bankers in the world . For three generations they have financed caravans , fleets , wars . I never knew any of them well , but Xerxes was altogether too familiar with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly short of money and the Egibis were invariably helpful and sometimes reasonable . Ordinarily they lend money at twenty percent . For Xerxes , they would reduce the rate to ten percent , which made it possible for him to start if not complete a dozen palaces during his lifetime , as well as conduct the Greek wars . Xerxes ' wife Roxanna was a granddaughter of an Egibi . She was very much ashamed of a connection that very much amused him . " They can not refuse money to a relative , " he would say . Darius despised bankers , which was curious , since he himself was essentially a man of the marketplace . I suppose that he wanted to eliminate the middle-man . In any case , he financed the realm through tribute and plunder . According to Xerxes , Darius almost never took a loan . " But then , I do n't think my father ever understood the system . " I never told the Great King Xerxes that there was very little about finance that his predecessor had not understood . Darius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious . Although he is supposedto have learned the trick of short-changing the citizens from Hippias , I think that it was the other way around . On the other hand , the gold coinage was always honest in Darius ' day . " I am the archer , " he would say , ringing one of his coins on the table . " That is my face , my crown , my bow . Men must appreciate my true weight . " They did . They do . Only recently has the gold coinage been debased . I was able to arrange several meetings between Fan Ch'ih and Xerxes . As interpreter , I saw to it that they got on well . Not only was I able to interest Xerxes in India but Fan Ch'ih 's stories of the cities of Cathay excited both of us . " How large the world is ! " Xerxes exclaimed at one point . We had just run out of maps and Fan Ch'ih was not very explicit when it came to describing the approaches to Cathay . Ile did tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high mountains to the east of the old Shakya republic ; the other crossed the wide northern desert beyond the Oxus River . Fan Ch'ih himself had come by sea to the Magadhan port of Champa . " But it took me more than a year , " he said . " And I do n't want to go back that way . I want to find a good overland route  --  a silk road , connecting us with you . " Later , in Cathay , Fan Ch'ih told me that he had been deliberately vague about the approaches to what they call the Middle Kingdom because he had been overwhelmed by the immensity of Darius ' empire . " I had thought Persia would be like Magadha . Instead , I found a universal monarch who , luckily for us , had no idea just how much of a universe there is . So I decided that it would not be a good idea for him to visit Cathay . A Persian army on the Yellow River would be highly disturbing . " Note the contrast between a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Greek is always ready to betray his native land . Although the Middle Kingdom is split into dozens of warring states , no man of Cathay  --  except , perhaps the so-called son of heaven  --  would dream of asking help from the army of an alien race . The yellow people are not only exceptionally intelligent , they are perfectly convinced that of all the world 's people they are unique . In their eyes , we are barbarians ! That 's why only a few adventurous souls like Fan Ch'ih ever leave Cathay . The rest are indifferent to what lies beyond their Middle Kingdom . Fan Ch'ih had been quick to make a number of business arrangements with Egibi and sons . Skillfully he exploited their passion for silk or Cathay cloth . He sold what he had ; bought what he could afford ; borrowed against future profits . While I was still waiting for a private audience with the Great King , Fan Ch'ih had managed to finance a convoy of cargo ships to take him t o India , where he would transfer his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enter Cathay through the high mountains , a long and hazardous journey of the sort that young men embark upon without a second thought . After a brief period of mourning for Parmys , Darius held a levee and I took this opportunity to present Fan Ch'ih at court . At first there were all sorts of objections from the second room of the chancellery . Was the yellow man really an ambassador ? If so , from what king ? If he was simply a merchant , he could not be received . That was definite . Finally Xerxes intervened and Ambassador Fan Ch'ih was commanded to attendthe Great King and present him with the duke of Lu 's acknowledgment of the Great King 's lordship over him . At noon we arrived in the hall of columns . Xerxes had only just finished this handsome building , situated to the northwest of the palace . I was received courteously by the court chamberlain . I was treatedp268gravely by the Persian nobles , who have never quite known what to make of me . On principle , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I am a noble . Nevertheless , though not one thing or the other , I am close to the royal family , and so all the nobles offer me polite smiles , proffered cheeks , whispered compliments  --  all except for Gobryas . He never gave me more than a nod . As part of the Atossa-Xerxes faction , I was the enemy . I noted that the old man 's whiskers had undergone yet another transformation . From a harsh red , they had changed like autumn leaves to a dull gold . Although Mardonius was nowhere in sight , more than a hundred of the Great King 's sons and nephews were present . For the first time I saw Artaphrenes , the son of the satrap of Lydia . He looked like his father except for the expression of the face , which was positively stonelikewith ambition . At his side was the Median admiral Datis , whom I had met years before at the hunting lodge on the road to Pasargada . The Greek contingent was grouped to the left of the throne . Hippias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm of Milo , now a handsome man . I bowed to Hippias . I embraced Milo , who said with wonder , " You 've turned black . " " Too much fire eating , " I said , backing off . I did not want to speak to the king of Sparta . Fan Ch'ih stayed close to me . The nobles stared at him as if he were some sort of strange animal . He stared right back . Although Persian architecture was not to his taste , he did admire the splendor of the costumes . " Only , " he asked suddenly , " where are the Egibis ? " " This is the court . " I thought that was answer enough . " I know . I also know that they lend money to the crown prince . So why are n't they here ? " " This is the court , " I repeated . " The Egibis are bankers , merchants . The Great King can not receive them . " " But his family does business with them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the nobles may wait upon the Great King . Is n't it the same in Cathay ? " " It has been said that , perhaps , it was so in the old days . " Fan Ch'ih was a master of the uninformative reference , usually attributed to his teacher , Master K'ung . In each of the Great King 's capitals , court ceremonial conforms to whatever protocol obtained before the creation of the Persian empire . At Memphis , he is pharaoh , and a god . At holy Pasargada , he is clan leader . At Babylon , he is a Chaldean king whose power is granted him by a priesthood who takes the line that although the city might currentlybelong to a mortal Persian king , the court 's ceremonial must never cease to be anything less than an earthly reflection of Bel-Marduk'simmortal glory . As a result , musicians play music rather more suitable for an evening with prostitutes than for a levee of the Greatp269King while temple dancers make distractingly obscene movements as they render homage to Ishtar who is Cybele who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Babylon the high priest of Bel-Marduk acts as master of ceremonies . That day the high priest was in excellent voice . He stood at the entrance to the hall of columns and howled at us in old Chaldean . Then the guards commander roared , " The Great King Darius , lord of all the lands , king of Babel , king of kings ! " Darius appeared in the doorway , the sun behind him . As he put his foot on the long Sardis rug that leads to the throne , we prostrated ourselves . The Great King was dressed in the purple Median robe that only the sovereign may wear . On his head was the high felt cidaris circled by Cyrus ' blue-and-white fillet . In his right hand , he held the golden sceptre ; in his left hand , he held the golden lotus . The court chamberlain carried the ceremonial fly whisk and folded napkin . The guards commandercarried the footstool . A member of the Babylonian royal family held the traditional golden parasol over the Great King 's head . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few paces behind the Great King walked the crown prince . As Darius made his slow stately progress down the center of the hall , the priests of Bel-Marduk began solemnly to chant . Although we were supposed to be looking at the redwash floor , we were all watching the Great King . Darius was now blond as a Scythian . I looked for signs of age , and found them  --  always an easy thing to do , except in one 's own mirror . Several months earlier , Darius had suffered some kind of paralysis . As a result , he dragged , very slightly , his left leg , and the left hand , which held the lotus , looked stiff . Later I was told that Darius had no strength at all in the entire left side of his body and that the lotus had been tied to his fingers . Nevertheless , Darius ' face was still handsome and he did not seem to he more than usually painted . The blue eyes were clear . Even so , the contrast between him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head taller than his father ; and he was young . In Xerxes ' left hand was a golden lotus . The right hand was still empty . I suspect that Darius was perfectly aware that there was no one in t hat hall who was not wondering how long it would be before there was a new occupant of the lion throne  --  except that the lion throne was not used in Babylon . At the insistence of the priests , the Great King was obliged to sit in a somewhat unimpressive gilded chair that had been used by the Akkadian kings for a thousand years , or so the high priest maintained . When Babylon rebelled for the last time , Xerxes had the chair chopped up and burned . As Xerxes watched the smoky flames , he said , " You see , I was right ! Its new wood . They fake everything here . "  |p270The  cult of antiquity has always been a kind of madness at Babylon . Credit for this must be given to Nabonidus , the last Babylonian king . He spent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nabonidus was so busy trying to decipher the contents of the foundation stone of a thirty-two-century-old temple that he never noticed that he was no longer king until he returned to the city one evening and found Cyrus in residence at the new palace . At least that 's the story the black-haired people like to tell . Actually , Naboniduswas captured , imprisoned , freed . He then went back to his digging . Between Nabonidus and his friend Amasis , the pharaoh of Egypt , the past was  --  and is  --  constantly being not only disinterred but imitated . Nothing can ever be old enough or ugly enough for the true lover of antiquity . Worse , all sorts of long-forgotten religious rites have been revived , particularly in Egypt . To Cyrus ' ever-lasting shame , he encouragedthe antiquarian passion of his Babylonian and Egyptian subjects ; worse , it was his policy to identify the Achaemenids with every extinct dynasty of any note . Except for Xerxes , all of his successors have continuedthe madness . For more than twenty years a dozen Magians labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible genealogies for Darius . Eventually he was related to everyone from Zeus to Amon Ra , and always in the direct line ! Darius took his seat . Xerxes stood behind him . We got to our feet and stood , hands in our sleeves , heads respectfully bowed . The Babylonian high priest intoned the Great King 's titles ; then followed an erotic dance by women from Ishtar 's temple . The whole ceremony was very un-Persian . Armed with lists , the court chamberlain began to whisper into Darius ' ear things that he needed to know . Since Darius was now rather deaf , there was a good deal of confusion . Quite often the wrong person was awarded the command of a nonexistent frontier post . Nevertheless , Darius insisted that he alone make every appointment , unlike Xerxes , who turned over to the chancellery all routine assignments . As a result , Darius never lost control of the machinery of a government which Xerxes never mastered . Darius then spoke of general matters . From time to time he would mispronounce simple words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whole paralysis of the left side . Democedes once told me that there is absolutely nothing to be done when this has happened . But if the patient is a powerful and willful man , certain herb poultices can be prescribed on the ground that " they will cause the patient practicallyno harm . " He was a rare physician . All was well on the northern borders , said Darius . The tribes were quiet . There had been civil disobedience in Armenia . The Great King had put a stop to it . There were the usual alarms out of Egypt . Butp271Egypt was like Babylon , filled with religious fanatics , madmen , adventurers . The Great King had restored tranquillity . As Darius spoke , I watched the Greeks . Demaratus and Hippias jointly headed a group of perhaps twenty exiles . Except for Hippias , there were no longer any tyrants at the court . That era was finished . The current Greeks were disgruntled generals , admirals , magistrates , who felt , often rightly , that they had been ill treated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the Athenian assembly is uncommonly perverse . Any citizen can be sent packing if a majority of the city 's occasionally corrupt but always frivolousassembly votes for ostracism . Sooner or later , just about every distinguished man of state is exiled . Democritus thinks that I exaggerate . I do n't . One day they will rid themselves of General Pericles simply because he bores them . " In the matter of the west . " Darius crossed his arms . Sceptre and lotus changed sides just as crook and flail do when Egypt 's pharaoh chooses to symbolize his dominion over the double realm . " We are well pleased with our nephew Mardonius . He has broken the power , such as it was , of the western Greeks . The Thracians have sent us earth and water in acknowledgment of our sovereignty . King Alexanderof Macedonia has sent us earth and water . He is our slave , forever more . The matter of the western Greeks is settled . There will be no spring campaign . " Although Xerxes was obliged to remain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his lips begin to part in a half-smile . There were no smiles from the Greeks . The Great King had spoken from the throne . Only in private audiences could the Greeks argue for war and , of course , they would . Darius would not have a peaceful winter . The Great King looked about the room . When he saw me , he nodded . We now receive our ambassador to the sixteen kingdoms beyond the Indus River . We commend Cyrus Spitama for having opened a trade route between our satrapy of India and the countries of ... of ... " There was a good deal of muttering between Darius and the court h.unberlain . The chamberlain had difficulty pronouncing the words Koshala and Magadha , which , in any case , Darius could not hear . Irritably , Darius silenced the chamberlain with a prod from the sceptre. " ... and the sixteen countries , " said Darius firmly . " The first caravan arrived at Bactra just before the full moon , with a large consignment of smelted iron . In the coming year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... from these far-off places . Approach , Cyrus Spitama . " Two ushers came forward . They escorted me to the throne . I prostrated myself at the golden footstool . You are now my eyes , " said Darius.  |p272The  chancellor had already told me that I was to be made king 's eye . This meant that as a high officer of state I would be able to draw a comfortable salary from the treasury . I would also be able to stay at any of the royal palaces and travel wherever I chose , at government expense , accompanied by a ceremonial guard and a herald whose cry " Way for the king 's eye ! " was enough to make half the population of the empire fall to the ground with terror . At regular intervals , each satrapy is investigated by a king 's eye . Whatever complaints the citizens have against the satrap and his administration are brough to the attention of the king 's eye , who has the power to redress them on the spot . For the time that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surrogate . Since many of the satrapies are enormously rich and complex  --  I think particularlyof Egypt and Lydia and India  --  a corrupt king 's eye dies rich . I was not corrupt . Of course , I was never sent to a rich province . I did one tour of duty in the Ionian cities , where there is no great wealth , and another in Bactria , which is poor . I expressed my gratitude to the Great King , and to the Wise Lord who had inspired him . Finally , Darius gave me an amiable kick on the shoulder . He had heard enough of my gratitude . As I got to my feet I could see how haggard the painted face was . But the eyes were still bright , even mischievous . " There is , " the Great King announced , " to the east of the east , a land which is known as Cathay . " Darius was plainly enjoying himself at the expense of the Greeks , who had not the slightest interest in my embassy . Curiously enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure of new worlds to conquer . It was their view that Persia was large enough as it was . They have always lacked curiosity . " This far-off land is full of cities and rivers , full of gold and cows . " Darius was now speaking for his own amusement , and perhaps mine . " The people are descended from a yellow god and they live on either side of a yellow river that never goes dry . Once upon a time they had a heaven-sent ruler . But since he died the nobles do nothing but quarrel with one another , just as we used to do . What was once a single rich kingdom is now an unhappy land of small and turbulent states in need of a great king who will protect them and give them a sound currency and perfect justice . The lord of one of these countries to the east of the east is now ready to offer us earth and water . He has sent us an ambassa-dor . " All of this was somewhat disingenuous , to say the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an embassy . But Darius knew exactly what he was doing . He wanted to whet the interest of the clans . He wanted to convince them of a fact which he had always known : Persia 's future lies to the east , and to the east of the east . Fortunately , Fan Ch'ih did not understand a word of Persian , and I told him only what I wanted him to hear . Then I told the Great Kingp273what he wanted to hear . As no one present understood the Indian dialect that Fan Ch'ih and I used , I was able to mistranslate and misinterpretfreely . Fan Ch'ih prostrated himself before the Great King . If nothing else , our inward-looking court was distracted by his appearance . Everyone stared at him . Although there are yellow men in every important Persiancity , no noble would have seen one up close unless he was in trade , a not very likely prospect since a Persian noble may not trade or borrow money  --  in theory , anyway . The yellow people of Cathay are simply a rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he saw . From head to toe , Fan Ch'ih was dressed in crimson Cathay cloth . He was a good-looking man , about my age . Of the warrior class , he had served in the army of one of the leading families of the duchy of Lu . Unlike most young men of his race and class , he wanted to see the outside world . In order to do so , he had made trade with the west the pretext for his journey to India and to Persia . Fan Ch'ih said , " I do reverence to the Great King . " In translation , I changed Great King tr universal monarch . Fan Ch'ih said , " I am here to reopen the overland trade route betweenCathay and Persia . " I translated this exactly . I also added , " I come as ambassador from the duke of Lu , a land as large and as rich as Lydia . My master says that should you come to him with your armies , he will offer you earth and water and submit to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall of columns , except amongst the Greeks . For the Greek , what is not Greek is not . Darius looked very happy . " Tell your master that I shall come to him with all my hosts . Tell him that I shall take with my own hands the earth and water that he offers me . Tell him that I will then make him my satrap of . . . of all Cathay . " Darius was superb . He had no more idea what Cathay was like than I did . We might just as well have been talking about the moon . But to the court , Darius sounded knowledgeable , sern  --  nc , all-powerful . Fan Ch'ih was plainly puzzled by our exchange , which was considerablylonger than his own mild request for the reopening of a trade route . I said to Fan Ch'ih , " The Great King will protect any caravan that goes from Persia to Cathay . He commands you to make a list for him of those things that your country has to exchange for Persian gold or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall obey his command . Tell him that he has answered my heart 's desire . " I said to the Great King , " If you come to Lu , you will answer the hart 's desire of its ruler , who promises to serve you loyally as satrap of all Gathay. "  |p274The  performance that Darius and I gave was the talk of the court for the rest of the winter . Even the dullest of the Persian nobles was now intrigued by a possible campaign to the east , and to the east of the east . Overnight it became the fashion to wear something of Cathay cloth . As a result , every scrap of silk in the market was sold out , to the delight of the Egibi banking interests , who then  --  as now  --  control the silk trade . Persian gold would be spent for Cathay cloth , and Egibi and sons would not only make twenty percent on their loan to Fan Ch'ih , they would also make an additional profit on the sale of silk in the markets . The Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darius always preferred small rooms to large . In this , he resembled the mountain lion who makes its lair in a cleft in the rock ; also , like most of the lords of this world that I have known , he invariably sat with his back to the wall . I found him peering at a stack of accounts . With age , he could read only if the writing was held very close to his face . I did obeisance . For some minutes he paid no attention to me . As I listened to his heavy breathing , I could hear a somewhat ominous lionlike rumbling in his chest . Finally he said , " Get up , King 's Eye . Let 's hope you 're not as flawed as the King 's real eyes . " I studied him intently from beneath respectfully lowered lids . The unevenly dyed hair and beard were in their usual disorder . The unpaintedface was sallow . In his stained and rumpled tunic , he could have been a Greek horse trainer . The weakened left arm and hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top , and one was not aware of any physical disability . " You paid too much for the iron . " " Yes , Great King . " One did not argue with Darius . " But I shall want a second consignment . This time we will pay not in gold but in kind . Do you know what these people want ? " " I do , Lord . I 've prepared a list and given it to the second room of the chancellery . " " Where it will vanish forever . Tell the councilor for the east that I want the list today . " Darius put down the documents that he had been holding in his good right hand . He sat back in his chair . He smiled broadly . The teeth were strong , yellow  --  yes , lionlike . That is my persistentimage for the Great King . " I dream of cows , " said the lion , in character . " They exist , Lord . Millions of them , waiting to be herded . " " How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the army were to leave for the Indus valley next spring they could spend the summer  --  which is the Indian rainy season , at Taxila . Then when the good weather starts , in our autumn , you would have four months in which to conquer Koshala and Magadha . " " So from beginning to end , I shall need one year . " Darius shoved the documents to one side , revealing the copper map that I had preparedp275for him . He tapped the metal with the gold ring on his forefinger ; there was a ringing sound . " Explain to me the distances . The kind of terrain . And what about all these rivers ? I 've never seen so many rivers in one country . How swift are they ? Will we need a fleet ? Or is there enough wood to build one there ? If not , will we have to bring the wood ? And what sort of boats ? " In the course of one hour , I have never been asked so many questions . Fortunately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's memory was perfect and he never asked the same question twice . Darius was particularly curious about Ajatashatru . He laughed when I told him that I was the son-in-law of his vassal-to-be . " It 's perfect ! " he said . " We 'll make you satrap of Magadha . After all , you 're a member of their royal family , and it is our policy to change things as little as possible . I suppose we 'll have to darken you up a bit . They 're all black , are n't they ? " " The common people , yes . But the ruling class is almost as light as we are . They 're Aryans , too . " " Whatever that may be . Anyway , we 'll dip you in henna . Although , come to think of it , you 're pretty black as it is . Now , what about all those people in Cathay ? Are they as yellow as that one you brought to court ? " " So I have heard , Lord . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes look very odd , do n't they ? How do I get to Cathay ? " Darius was already dreaming of Cathayancows . I pointed to the northeast corner of the map . " There is a pass through these mountains . But it is only open in the hot season . It 's a six-month journey , they say . " " What about by sea ? " " It would take at least three years  --  from Persia . " " That means one year from India . We would pass many islands , I should think . Rich islands . " " Islands , peninsulas , the mainland . Fan Ch'ih says that south of Ca-t hay there is nothing but jungle . But he also says that there are a number of good ports  --  and many pearls . " If one wanted to hold Darius ' attention , one was always well advised to mention things like pearls . " Well , we shall collect the Cathayan pearls once we have herded t hose Indian cows . " With a frown , Darius took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . I felt odd . I had seen his father make t he same gesture a hundred times . Darius was suddenly aware of what lie had done in front of me . " I can still ride a horse , " he said . He was natter-of-fact . " And lead an army , Lord . " I bowed low . " And lead an army . Xerxes would like to go to India . " Darius ' smile was sometimes boyish , despite the square straggling beard that almost hid the full , chafed lips . " I lc complains to you , I know . "  |p276I  felt the blood rise in my cheeks . Thus , charges of treason began . " Lord , never does he complain ... " But Darius was in a good mood . " Nonsense . As I have loyal eyes "  --  he indicated me  --  " so I have loyal ears . I do n't blame the boy . In fact , I would blame him if he did not complain . He 's the same age as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen is responsiblefor the life my son leads . She wants him safe . So I am guided by her . " Darius had a brief fit of coughing . Then he said , " I am not too old to lead the army . " The fact that Darius felt the need to repeat such a declaration was , for me , the first sign that he knew that he had begun to fail . " I 've stayed out of those Greek wars because they are not worth my time and effort . I also ca n't abide the Greeks . At the last levee in Susa , I counted more Greeks than Persians in the hall of columns . " Darius may have had difficulty reading , but he could count with the greatest of ease . " I am surrounded by Greeks , hungry for archers . " I was always faintly shocked when Darius used this slang expression . " Of both kinds , " he added . " But now I 've done with the whole lot of them . There 'll be no spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would n't be able to lead the army even if there was a campaign . So he made me a speech about all the battles that have been won by generals in litters , which is nonsense . I can still ride from sunrise to sundown . " With that non sequitur , Darius convinced me that he would never take the field again . I was delighted . Soon Xerxes would have his chance . " You 've done well . " Darius pushed the map to one side . " Tell the chancellery what you think we should send to Cathay . Write those two kings  --  you know , the Indian ones  --  that the Great King smiles upon his slaves . The usual sort of thing . And tell them that we shall dispatch a caravan before the end of the coming year . " Darius smiled . " Do not mention that I myself will be the caravan master . And that all our merchandise will be metal  --  swords , shields , lances ! Before I die , I shall be . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Universal monarch . " " I shall be the first universal monarch . I dream of pearls and silk  --  of islands and Cathay ! " If Darius had been ten years younger , and I had been ten years older , I am convinced that all the known world that mattered would now be Persian . But , as I had guessed , Darius never again led the clans into battle . In less than five years , he would be lying next to his father in the rock tomb outside Persepolis.  |p277MARDONIUS  RECEIVEDme aboard a houseboat moored to the new palace quay . The commanderin chief of the armies and the navies of the Great King looked pale and fragile , and even younger than he actually was . He lay in a hammockthat was suspended between two beams . As the boat responded to the river 's currents , the hammock swayed of its own accord . " When the boat rocks , the pain is less , " Mardonius said as I crawled down the ladder to his quarters . The festering leg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flies . A brazier of burning sandalwoodcould not disguise the smell of rotting flesh that filled the cabin . " Ugly , is n't it ? " " Yes . " I was to the point . " Cut it off . " " No . I must have two legs . " " You can die of this sort of rot . " " The worst is over . Or so they say . If it is n't ... " Mardonius shrugged ; then grimaced with pain from the effort . All about us , we could hear the usual sounds of a busy port . Men shouted and hawsers creaked and the circular Babylonian boats made a slapping sound as they moved against the river 's current . " Does n't the noise bother you ? " Mardonius shook his head . " I like it . When I shut my eyes , I think I 'm still with the fleet . Do you want to sail with me next spring ? " " To Thrace ? " I do n't know why I was so tactless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a part of his fleet was lost in a storm . Mardonius frowned . " Yes . Thrace , too . Where your relatives are now in rebellion . " " Abdera may be in rebellion , but not Lais ' family . They are all pro-I'ersian . " " I met your grandfather . I had no idea he was so rich . " " I 've never met him , I 'm sorry to say . I do know that he was always loyal to the Great King . " " Ile 's Greek . " Mardonius tugged at the cords of his hammock to snake it swing along a wider arc . " Why have you been excitingp278Xerxes with those tales of India ? " Mardonius was accusing . " He asked me . And I told him . If you like , I 'll tell you the same stories . Our future is in the east . " " That 's because you were brought up on the eastern frontier . " Mardoniuswas irritable . " You have no idea what Europe is like . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Darius tried to conquer Europe , remember ? He was badly beaten . " " That 's treason , " said Mardonius , with no attempt at lightness . " The Great King has never been defeated . " " Just as his commanders are never wounded ? " I always spoke as an equal to Mardonius . I do n't suppose that he liked it , but since he and I and Xerxes had been as one for so many years , he could hardly complain . Finally , Mardonius was more fond of me than I was of him . This always gives one an advantage . Since I could never command an army , I was no threat to him . He also thought that he could influence the advice that I gave to Xerxes . " That was a stupid mistake . " Mardonius shifted his weight in the hammock . I tried not to look at the leg and , of course , looked at nothing else . " There 's no reason why you could n't lead the armies into India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have never wavered from it to this day . But Mardonius was the sole executor of the western policy . He did not have an easy task . The Great King had lost interest in Europe after his defeat on the Danube ; his days were spent fretting about the northern tribes , and thinking up new ways of making money . By and large , Darius had had no real desire for further conquests until I fired his imagination with my tales of India and Cathay . For several hours Mardonius and I argued in that stinking cabin , whose constant rocking made me somewhat ill . Although Mardonius knew of my private audience with Darius , he was too shrewd to ask me what had been said . Perhaps he already knew . There are not many secrets at the Persian court . It was already common knowledge that I had come down to Babylon with Xerxes . " I want Xerxes to lead the next Greek expedition . I 'll be second in command . " I could see that Mardonius thought that he was being subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not at all subtle . " But Amestris will make him go . " Mardonius smiled . " She is a great influence on our friend . " " So I 've heard . Does she want him to go ? " " Of course she does . She hates seeing me get all the glory . I do n't blame her . That 's why I 'm willing to share the credit for the conquest of Europe . " " Exactly how much of Europe do you expect to acquire ? " This was a real question . In those days we knew even less than we know nowp279about the extent and variety of the western lands . Phoenician traders had given us a good idea of the ports or potential ports along the northern coast of the Mediterranean . But the interior of that densely forested and largely empty continent was then , as it is now , a mystery , not worth unraveling  --  in my view , of course . " On principle , we should destroy Athens and Sparta and bring the inhabitants here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would occupy Sicily . It is an enormous island where we can grow enough grain to feed all Persia , which will make us less reliant on this damned barley . " Mardoniusmade a face . " If you want to understand the Babylonians , just think of barley  --  and palm wine . They live on nothing else , and look at them ! " " They 're quite handsome , as black-headed people go . " " I 'm not speaking of beauty . I do n't want prostitutes . I want soldiers , and there are none here . " But soon there were . Almost the entire Greek faction at court joined us in the cabin . The aged Hippias and I embraced . " This will be my last campaign , " he whispered in my ear . Although he was old and the teeth in his mouth were loose , he could still ride a horse as if he and the horse were one . " I dreamt last night that my mother held me in her arms . That is always a good sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Athens , offering a sacrifice to Athena . " " Let us hope so , Tyrant . " I was polite . Demaratus was not . " Let us hope that there is a campaign . " The Spartan looked at me without pleasure , and the others took their lead from him . Even Milo 's rosy face was sad at the thought that I might be , truly , an enemy . As I excused myself , Mardonius insisted that I come see him again . " Next time I 'll have a map of Europe for you , of the sort that should gladden any king 's eyes . " He laughed . The Greek conspirators did not . The sun was hot as I climbed the steps from the wharf to the low gate t hat marks the end of the avenue of Bel-Marduk . Here my guards and herald were waiting . I had almost forgotten them . I was still not used to the pleasures and annoyances of high rank . It is one thing to be honored in a strange country like Magadha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quite another to walk or ride down the iiiairr avenue of Babylon , attended by guards whose swords are drawn , and by a herald whose clear voice proclaims , " Way for the king 's eye ! " And way is made . People shrink as if from a fire that might burn them , which the king 's eye is . When the court is at Babylon , the city is overcrowded . The temples are busy not only with religious services and ritual prostitution but , most important ( Sall , with moneychanging and moneylending . It is said that banking was invented by the Babylonians . This may be true . Butp280it is also true that , elsewhere , and quite independently , the Indians and Cathayans have worked out their own systems . I was always struck by the fact that the interest rates in each part of the world are usually the same . Yet there has been little or no regular contact between the three lands . I find this truly mysterious . I made my way on foot through the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guards , I was able to reach the main offices of Egibi and sons without too much jostling  --  and spitting . The black heads take revenge on their Persian masters by spitting on them whenevera sufficiently large crowd provides adequate cover . The facade of the world 's most important banking establishment is a featureless mud wall in which is set a plain cedar door with a small window . At my approach , the door opened . Black slaves with ritually scarred faces bowed me into a small courtyard where I was met by the head of the family , a smiling little man named Shirik . When my herald proclaimed the presence of the king 's eye , he dropped to his knees . Respectfully , I helped him up . Shirik was amiable , watchful , and entirely unimpressed by me . He showed me into a long high room whose walls were lined with shelves on which were stacked thousands of clay tablets . " Some of those records go back more than a century , " he said . " To the days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , we were not slaves . There is a legend that we were Jewish captives , brought here after Jerusalem fell . But we were never slaves . We had established ourselves in Babel long before their arrival . " We were joined by Fan Ch'ih and the Cathay man who served Shirik . We sat at a round table , surrounded by clay tablets that represented millions of sheep , tonnes of barley , stacks of iron and nearly all the archers ever minted . I think that I might have done well at banking had I not been so carefully trained to be neither a priest nor a warrior . Although I have the Persian noble 's contempt of trade , I lack his passion for war and hunting and drinking wine to excess . Although I have a priest 's deep knowledge of religion , I am not certain what is true . Although I once heard the voice of the Wise Lord , I confess now in my old age that to hear and to listen are two different things . I am puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am willing to finance a caravan to Cathay . I am impressed by Fan Ch'ih . So is my colleague , from the neighboring duchy of Wei . " Shirik indicated his yellow assistant , an unprepossessing creature with a blind eye , pale as moonstone . Shirik was precise in all his references . He knew that Wei was not a kingdom but a duchy . To the extent that he was able to obtain the information that he needed  --  no , craved  --  he got everything right . Except for Darius , I have never met a man with such a passionate interest in the details of this world.  | " Naturally , there are difficulties , " said Shirik , beginning to place the borrower on the defensive . " Numerous but surmountable , Lord Shirik . " Fan Ch'ih was now beginning to learn to speak a sort of Persian that nicely complemented Shirik 's own oddly accented but entirely fluent Persian . Shirik was Babylonian , and to this day the people of Babel avoid learning Persian on the never admitted ground that , sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absorbed by Babylon 's older and superior culture . For a time we discussed the approaches to Cathay . The safest seemed to be overland from Shravasti to the mountain passes . We were all agreed that the sea route is endless , and that the trail from Bactria to the east is not passable because of the Scythian tribes . While we talked , Shirik moved the ivory disks of an abacus so swiftly that they made a blur like a hummingbird 's wings . " Naturally , a single caravan is worthless . " Shirik offered us wine in solid-gold cups whose bright grandeur was in startling contrast to all t hose dusty tablets that lined the walls , so like the tumbled mud bricks of some dead city . But then , those unprepossessing but entirely alive tablets had made possible the golden cups . " Let us say that the caravan reaches Lu or Wei . Let us say that a second caravan returns safely to Babylon with goods whose value are in excess of what was sent out . Let us say that all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that the first caravan will not arrive and eleven to one that if it does , the return caravan will never reach Babylon . " I assumed that he had , somehow , worked out these odds on the abacus . " But I am willing to gamble . For five generations it has been the dream of our family to open a route between Babylon  --  that is , Persia  --  and Cathay . We have always had our connections with the Indian kingdoms . " Shirik turned to me . " The merchant-banker that you did business with at Varanasi is a valued colleague of ours . Of course , he and I shall never meet in this world , but we manage to correspond once or twice a year , and do what business we can . " It took less than an hour for Shirik to make his offer to me . " We believe that this enterprise would be a great success if you were to accompany the caravan as the Great King 's ambassador to the Middle Kingdom . As you know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does , " said Fan Ch'ih , " and it does not . " " An observation , " said Shirik , " worthy of the Buddha . " I was amazed to hear the name of the Buddha on the lips of a Babylonianhanker two thousand miles from the banks of the Ganges River . There was little that Shirik did not know about the world he was obliged to deal with.  | " I would also suggest , most humbly , that you take your leave before the start of the spring campaign . " " There will be no spring campaign , " I said . Shirik smiled his gentle , secret smile . " I can not contradict the king 's eye ! I am too humble , Lord . So let me say that should there be , by some miracle , a combined land-and-sea attack on Eretria and Athens , the expense of mounting that invasion will be enormous . Should such a campaign take place , Egibi and sons will be obliged to make their contribution , ever so gladly , gladly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures , I would suggest to the king 's eye who honors us with his presence today , that he whisper in the ear of that glorious sovereign whose eye he is , that an embassy should be sent to Cathay before the Persian fleet leaves Samos . " " There will be no Greek war this year . " I was firm in my ignorance . " I have spoken  --  " I almost made the error that the courtier must never make : repeat in public a private conversation with the Great King. "  --  to the Lord Admiral Mardonius , yes . " Swiftly , Shirik saved me from indiscretion . " Your dearest friend , after your truly dearest friend , the Lord Xerxes the crown prince , the viceroy of Babel . . . Yes , yes , yes . " He treated me rather the way that a Greek philosopher who happens to be a slave will treat his master 's son . He was both subservientand imposing , courteous and contemptuous . " Yes , " I said . " I have just come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not physically able to lead the expedition . " " The last part is all too true . Lord Mardonius will not lead the Great King 's forces . But there will be a war . The decision has been made . The command will be divided . I tell you no state secrets for if these were indeed high secrets , how would poor Shirik of the house of Egibi know them ? One commander will be Artaphrenes , the son of the satrap of Lydia . The other will be Datis the Mede . Six hundred triremes will rendezvous at Samos . They then will sail for Rhodes , Naxos , Eretria , Athens . But you know all this , Lord . You take pleasure in allowing a humble old man to make a fool of himself by telling you what is known to all who attend the Great King 's councils . " I did my best to pretend that I was indeed a repository of state secrets . Actually , I was entirely taken aback . Although I was not surprised that the banker might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that Mardonius knew nothing of the spring campaign , and I was entirely certain that Xerxes was ignorant of his father 's plans . If Shirik was correct , then , for reasons unknown , the Greek faction had once again persuaded the Great King to commit himself to a war in the west . I agreed with Shirik that embassy and caravan should travel as one , and I said that I would propose myself to the Great King as ambassador . But as we made our plans I could think of nothing but Darius ' duplicity . He had promised me an invasion of India . Naturally , Great Kings arep283not obliged to honor promises made to their slaves . Yet by Darius ' own admission , Persia 's interest was to the east . Why had he changed his mind ? In those days Xerxes liked to wander about Babylon in disguise . He would wear a Chaldean cloak in such a way that the hood covered the telltale square-cut beard . With face covered , he looked like a moderatelyunsuccessful young merchant from some upriver village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say , " If they are going to kill me , they will kill me . If it happens , it happens . " Eventually , it happened . In our youth , thanks to Atossa , Xerxes was never entirely on his own . Wherever he went , guards were always close at hand . Even so , I must say that these expeditions always made me uneasy . " Why expose yourselflike this ? " " I enjoy it . Anyway , since no one ever knows in advance just when I plan to vanish  --  including me  --  that rules out ambush , does n't it ? " Xerxes and I vanished the day after my conference with Shirik . My heralds and guards were dismissed , while Xerxes ' personal guards were dressed to resemble farmers come to market . Then , contentedly , Xerxes led me through the quarter of those privately owned brothels which are far superior to the temple establishments . In a good private house , it is possible to dine well , listen to music , enjoy the resident girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls are often lovely ; and always clean . Xerxes ' favorite house was in an alleyway between the back wall of t he temple of Ishtar and the camel market . The owner and mistress of the revels was a bewhiskered woman who had no idea who we were . But she always remembered with simulated fondness the handsome gray-eyed young Persian who paid her well and made no trouble . At the door she greeted us with her usual " Gallant young princes , you are like the sun in a dark place ! Enter , enter ! " Somewhat incongruously , she spoke the language of the old Babyloiiiancourt , where she had spent her childhood as , she claimed , a concubineof Nabonidus . But the other house owners in the district assured us that she had been not a concubine but a cook . Babylonian malice is always elaborate and amusing if one is not the butt . " By now , " said an aged competitor , " the old thing really believes that she was queen of Babylon . But she was the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice lads go near her place . She has every sort of disease . And , of course , she 's a eunuch . Did n't you know ? Have n't you noticed the little beard ? " As always , we paid in advance , which delighted Xerxes . He enjoyed pretending that he was an ordinary mortal . As always , I paid for both of us . The crown prince may not carry a purse . We were then shownp284into a large room at the top of the house , where we lay side by side on a low divan . Remembering Xerxes ' preference for Helbon wine , our hostess sent us a dozen flagons . Each was delivered by a different girl  --  an amiable way of showing us the house 's wares . In another room , Phrygian music was played . When the last girl had set down the last flagon of wine and departed , I told Xerxes about my visit to Shirik . Xerxes lay back on a cushion , cup in hand ; he shut his eyes and murmured , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " I asked . The room was warm and the smell of frankincense permeated everything , including the wine . I can not think why people are so attached to that cloying scent . I suppose because it is so rare . The satrap of Arabia provides the Great King with more than sixty thousand pounds a year , as tribute . " My father tells me nothing . We talk about building . We talk about "  --  Xerxes made a large gesture to indicate the satrapy of Babylon  --  " all this , and how it should be governed , as opposed to the way I govern it . He finds fault . " Xerxes sighed . " Datis is no threat . But my cousin Artaphrenes ... " The voice trailed off . " Let 's hope he 's inherited his father 's military prowess . I was there when Sardis burned , thanks to the old man 's negligence . " " Gobryas was never good at war , and look at his sons . " Suddenly Xerxes smiled for the first time since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mardonius will not be in command . " Xerxes clapped his hands , and a girl appeared in the low doorway . " I want Lydian music , " he said . " And Lydian food . " In no time at all , we were provided with both . While course after course was brought us , melody after melody was played us on twelvestringharps . Between courses , we were able to talk . " I did my best , " he said . " I told Darius we should go east next spring . " Xerxes plunged his hand into an earthenware pot filled with honeyed kid and pine nuts . " What did he say ? " " He agreed . He said , Yes , we should go east . ' That 's his way , of course . He said should and made me think that he had said would . But ... something 's odd . He really was excited by what you told him . " " Then why  --  " " I do n't know why . I never know why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . Particularly Hippias . He has some hold over my father . I ca n't think what . Yet every time the old man says , ' By Athena and Poseidon , I swear that I shall once again make sacrifice on the Acropolis ' "  --  Xerxes mimicked to perfection Hippias ' sonorousvoice , in which an old man 's quaver had only recently begun to sound  --  " Darius gets tears in his eyes and swears to help him . " " What about the king of Sparta ? "  | " Ask your mother . " Xerxes was sour . " I 've had no dealings with him . I suppose he wants us to restore him to power . What else ? He 's supposedto be a good soldier . Let 's hope Lais teaches him to bathe occasionally . " " Lais and I have quarreled . " " Over the Greeks ? " I nodded . " And you . And Mardonius . " Xerxes raised himself up on one elbow . He pulled me so close to him that the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could smell the sandalwood scent of his clothes and feel the warmth of his lips as he whispered into my ear , " Is she poisoning Mardonius ? " I drew back . " No , " I said in an ordinary voice . " I do n't think that the girl loves him at all . " " But I was told that she does , that she pines for him , day after day , a drop at a time , in the cup . " Xerxes was amused at our game . " I think that the girl wants certain people to think that she is in love when she is not . " Xerxes nodded . " I understand . Even so ... " To my delight , a pair of Indian dancers performed for us . Twins from ' l'axila , they were astonished when I addressed them in their own language . I asked them to perform the famous nautch dance , and they obliged . Xerxes was fascinated at the way their bellies moved first in one direction and then in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that he was still not entirely certain of the succession . " There is no way that you can not succeed . " I confess that I was somewhat bored with what I took to be groundless fears . Xerxes had been crown prince for several years . He had no rival . " Gobryas still wants his grandson to succeed , " Xerxes was obsessed . " And Artobazanes has never forgotten that once upon a time , he was crown prince . " " I must say I 'd almost forgotten . " The court had been at Ecbatana when Darius suddenly announced that Ile was leaving for the northeast frontier and since Persian  --  actueelly , Median  --  custom requires that whenever the ruler leaves the country , an heir must be designated , he chose his eldest son , Artobazanes. 1t tin ' time , Xerxes and I were perhaps thirteen or fourteen years old . I t I night nothing of the announcement until Lais asked me how Xerxes I1.ld reacted . When I said not at all , she shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to disguise his terror. 1Iter all , if Darius had not come back from the frontier , Artobazanes ss wild have been Great King and all of Atossa 's sons would have been put to death . " s we finished flagon after flagon of wine , Xerxes spoke of his brotherp286Ariamenes as a potential threat . Ariamenes was also satrap of Bactria , a territory prone to rebellion . " Spies tell me that he plans to take my place . " " How ? " " Poison . Rebellion . I do n't know . " " What does Atossa think of this . . . son of hers ? " " It was Atossa who warned me . " Xerxes shook his head , in a puzzled way . " You know , of all my brothers and half-brothers the only one that I ever liked was Ariamenes , who means to kill me . " " Unless you kill him first . " Xerxes nodded . " Unfortunately , Bactria is far away . That is why I had hoped "  --  he let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the northern route to Cathay  --  through Bactria . " Xerxes gave me a slow blink of his cat 's eyes . I turned to ice . " That is a most ... awesome commission . " How , I wondered desperately , was I going to kill the satrap of Bactria in his own capital ? " Well , you 've not been given it yet . But bear in mind that you may one day be obliged to demonstrate your love for your brother-in-law . " Dumbly , I looked at him through the same haze of wine that he looked at me . Then Xerxes embraced me . He was jubilant . " I 've had it out with the law-bearers . And I 've won . On new year 's day , you will marry my sister . " " I am not worthy . " That is the usual response . But , for once , I thought it apt . Who was Ito marry a daughter of the Great King ? I said as much , and more . But Xerxes ignored my demurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least , I must have you in the family . Atossa is delighted . " " What does the Great King say ? " " At first he was not pleased . But then he started to talk about Zoroasterand about what a disappointment he 's been to your grandfather'sfollowers , whom he values above all the Magians . You know the sort of harangue he gives when he wants to get something for nothing . Anyway , by the time he 'd finished , he had convinced himself that it was his idea that you marry one of his daughters in order to mingle the blood of Cyrus the Great with that of holy Zoroaster . Mingle my blood , that is , since he 's no more related to Cyrus than you are . " The rest of the day that we spent in the brothel is something of a blur . I remember sharing the Indian twins with Xerxes . I remember vomiting . I remember that our hostess gave me some powerful potion that immediately cleared my head , which then began to ache . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostling crowds to the new palace . At the foot of the ziggurat I asked , " Which of your sisters am I to marry ? " " You 're going to marry . . . uh ... " Xerxes stopped . He thought hard ; then shook his head . " I do n't remember . I 've only met two of the five.  |p287Anyway  , Atossa says that the one you 're getting is the best of the lot . Why do n't you ask Lais ? She knows the harem . " " I no longer talk to her . " " Well , ask Atossa . Or just wait and see . " Xerxes grinned in the brazen light . " After all , what difference does it make ? You 're marrying an Achaemenid , and that 's all that matters in this world . " FOR REASONS UNKNOWN , the Great King had turned his face once again to the west . There would be no expedition to the east in his reign . I said farewell , sadly , to Fan Ch'ih . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the next five years I enjoyed various high offices at Darius ' court , including the muchsought-afterrank of king 's friend , a title that I still hold but would not dare use at the present court . It has always been my view that one 's title and one 's actual status ought , reasonably , to coincide . As king 's eye , I was sent to inspect the Ionian cities . I enjoyed that tour of duty . For one thing , I was made much of , not only because ofmy rank but because I was half-Greek . For another , I was able to visit Abdera , where I met my grandfather , who received me like an only son . He was rich . He was witty . He was a sophist before the tribe was invented . Of course , Protagoras was a young woodcutter on his propertyand it is possible that he influenced my grandfather . It is equally possible that my grandfather influenced him . I also met my uncle  --  your grnulfat her Democritus . He was then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . I shall not pursue a subject you know better than I.From Abdera , I set sail for home . This uneventful sea journey ended at Hilicarnassus , where we made landfall one bright dawn when the stars were still to he seen in the west . As I went ashore , I half expected to find my younger self gaping not only at his first view of the sea but at the mature specter of the impressive king 's eye that he was to be/come . But instead of my youthful self , I saw the grown-up Mardonius in the flesh . He was sitting on the end of the mole , surrounded by fishermen unloading their nets . " Way for the king 's eye ! " my herald bawled . " Way is made . " Mardonius got to his feet and bowed low . " Welcome to Halicarnassus . " " Lord Admiral ! " As we embraced I could feel the fleshless body through his heavy cloak . It had been two years since he was wounded , and he was still not recovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes reflected with the clearness of a child the morning 's bright sea light . " I am entirely out of the world , " he said as we crossed the waterfront to the street that leads up the hill to Artemisia 's palace . " Invisible . Forgotten . " " Invisible to the court . But not forgotten . What are you doing here ? " Mardonius paused at the foot of the hill . He was breathing hard and sweat shone on his brow . " When I lost my command , I told the Great King that I would like to retire from court . " " Forever ? " " Who knows ? I mean , the only true forever is death . Is n't that so , dear cousin ? " He gave me an odd look . " Who would have thought that you 'd ever marry into our family ! " " Their family . " And I mimicked his tone : " Dear cousin . " " Mine , too , by blood . Yours through marriage . And Xerxes ' unswervinglove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace , Mardonius took my arm . He did not limp so much as swagger , the body swinging from side to side as he tried not to put too great a weight on the shattered leg . Halfway up the hill he let go my arm . " Climbing is the worst , " he gasped ; and sank onto a limestone ledge . I sat beside him . Below us the houses of the town looked like so many game dice strewn at the rough edge of the purple channel that separatesthe mainland from the dark-green mountains of the island of Cos . Home of the god Pan , I thought  --  then checked myself . I thought of the pirates who live in those lovely mountains , of the island 's lax civil administration , of the taxes in arrears . I was very much the stern inspector , the entirely incorruptible king 's eye . Mardonius then told me that " As soon as the young Artaphrenes and Datis left for Greece , I came to Halicarnassus . And I 've been here ever since . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mardonius gave me a somewhat challenging look . " I expect to be in command next year . " " But will there be a campaign next year ? Once Athens is destroyed , what 's the point ? " I picked at a small stone fish that had been imbedded in the limestone , a relic from the time of the Babylonian flood.  | " The point is Greater Greece . Sicily . Italy . " Mardonius grinned . " I never showed you my map , did I ? " " No . But then , I never showed you my map of the Indian kingdoms . " " We shall never agree . " " No . But why should you care ? " I was somewhat bitter . " You always win . You have some sort of magic over the Great King . When you say attack the Greeks , he attacks . " " Hippias has the magic . He is the sorcerer . " Mardonius was serious . " I only pray his spells are still effective . Old as he is , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Demaratus , who stays at Susa , where he has the Great King to himself . " " What do you think Demaratus wants ? " " The world ! What else is worth having ? " Mardonius positively shouted in my ear ; and the pale face turned , briefly , coral-pink . That was when I realized that not only was he going to recover but he would once again obtain if not the world , the command of the Great King 's forces . A goatherd with his flock approached us . He bowed low ; said something in dialect and moved on . Plainly , he had no notion who we were . We were simply foreigners on the way to the sea palace . Mardonius 's reaction was the same as mine . " We govern millions of people , " he said , with a certain wonder , " and they never even know our names . " " Not ours , perhaps . But they know that Darius is the Great King . " Mardonius shook his head . " That goatherd does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made a bet . While Mardonius rested on his rock perch , I made my way through the flock of goats to the herder , who looked alarmed . I said something to him ; he said something to me . I found his primitive Dorian dialect as baffling as he found my Ionian ( ; reek . Eventually we worked out a language suitable for my purpose , which was , simply , to ask , " Who is your sovereign ? " " Demetrius , young lord . He owns the whole of the back of that mountain over there . He owns this flock . " " But who is Demetrius ' lord ? " The man frowned , and thought . As he wrestled with this new con- cept , a louse took advantage of the stillness to make a swift journey from the hair that was pulled back from the herder 's left ear to the tangled heard that started halfway up his cheeks . The louse found a safe refuge in the beard forest , and I was pleased : those who are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " he said at last . I pointed to the gray palace above us . " What about the queen ? " " Queen ? " Ile said the word as though he had not heard it before . " The lady who lives up there ? "  | " Oh , the lady ! Yes , I 've seen her . She rides a horse like a man . She 's very rich . " " She is the queen of Halicarnassus . " The man nodded . The phrase was plainly unfamiliar to him . " Yes , yes , " he said . " The goats are straying , young Lord . " " But who is her lord ? " " Her husband , I suppose . " " She is a widow . Yet there is one person above her , and he is her sovereign . " Once again I had produced an unfamiliar word . " Sovereign ? " he repeated . " Well , I do n't come over to this side of the mountain all that much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " " But surely you know the name of the Great King . He is your sovereignand he is my sovereign , and everyone in the world knows his name . " " And what would that be , young Lord ? " Mardonius was delighted to win the bet . I was not . " There must be some way of reaching those people , " I said . " Why bother ? He looks after his goats and pays some sort of rent to a landowner who pays tax to the queen who pays tribute to the Great King . So what more can we want of a yokel like that ? Why should he bother his head with who we are , or who Darius is ? " As we made our way to the top of the cliff , sweat covered Mardonius ' face like a warm Indian rain . " The court is not the world , " he said somewhat unexpectedly . " No . " I was very much king 's eye . " But it is our world  --  and theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You have never been to sea . " Mardonius ' response was cryptic . When I reminded him that I had crossed the southern sea , he shook his head . " That 's not what I meant . You 've never commanded your own ship . There is nothing like it . " " Yes , sea lord . " I mocked him amiably . But he could not respond ; he was again out of breath . We sat on a broken column just opposite the palace and watched the suppliants come and go . " What news of Xerxes ? " Mardonius mopped his face with a sleeve . The sun had lost its dawn-chill , and the heat now seemed to rise from the earth itself . " He 's at Persepolis , " I said . " Building . " " Building ? " Mardonius picked up a pine cone . " That 's no life . " He pulled back the cone 's hard leaves in search of nuts . Finding none , he threw the cone at the tree that bore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the armies against Athens . " This was a lie , but I made no comment . " Darius agreed . " " Yet Xerxes was not allowed to go . " Mardonius rubbed his hand over the rough granite surface of thep291column . " Xerxes must have victories , " he said , caressing the stone as if it were a horse . " Last year when I realized that I was n't going to be strong enough to take the field , I advised Darius to call off the spring offensive in the west and send the army to that monkey-land of yours . " " Is this true ? " The question was rude . Because I did not know the answer . " A Persian noble may not lie , " said Mardonius , not smiling . " Even , " he added , " when he does . " He looked in pain . " Yes , it 's true . I want only one thing  --  to be the conqueror of the Greeks , and I do n't want to share that distinction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year Xerxes would take the army across the Indus River . " " Then next year you would take the army west ? " " Yes , that 's what I wanted . But that 's not what I got . " I believed Mardonius . After all , it was no secret that he wanted to be satrap of the Greeks in Europe . Since it now looked as if young Artaphreneswould enjoy that high office , I changed the subject . " Is Queen Artemisia contented with her position ? " Mardonius laughed . " Which one ? She has several . " " I speak as king 's eye . She ignores the satrap . She deals directly with the Great King . The satrap is not happy . " " But Artemisia is happy , and so are the people . This is a Dorian city , and the Dorians tend to worship their royal families . And then , of course , she 's popular in her own right , as I discovered . When I dismissed the Ionian tyrants , I dismissed her , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I wanted to replace a dynasty as old as the gods of the Aryans , I would have to fight her in the field . " " Hand to hand ? " " There was that implication . " Mardonius grinned . " Anyway , I sent her a soothing message , followed by my handsome person , with leg intact . " " Did she greet you on the floor ? " on the throne . Then on the bed . Floors are for the very young . She is a formidable woman and I 'd give a ... I 'd give my bad leg to marry her . But that is not possible . So I live quite openly with her , as if I were consort . It 's amazing . These Dorians are not like other Greeks , or anyone else . The women do as they please . They inherit property . They even have their own games , just like the men . " Except for Halicarnassus , I have never visited a Dorian city . I suspect that Halicarnassus must be the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dorian women always annoyed Xerxes . Eventuallyhe divorced or sent away his Dorian wives and concubines on the ground that he could not bear their melancholy . They actually resent being sequestered in the harem ! I have found that there is no attitude so bizarre that one will not encounter it sooner or later if one travels far enough.  |p292Artemisia  received us in a long low room with small windows that looked toward the sea and dark-green Cos . She was somewhat stouter than I remembered , but the golden hair was still golden and the face was agreeable despite the recent birth of a second chin . My herald announced me , as is the custom . The queen bowed not to me but to my office , as is the custom . After she had welcomed me to Halicarnassus , I told her of the Great King 's affection for his vassal . In a loud voice she swore obedience to the Persian crown ; then our attendantswithdrew . " Cyrus Spitama is a ruthless inspector . " Mardonius was now in a good mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by half . " He stretched himself out on a narrow bed that had been so placed that he could see the harbor from the window . He told me that most of his days were spent watching ships come and go . That morning , at first light , when he had recognized the sails of my ship , he had hobbled down to the port to greet me . " My treasury is the Great King 's . " Artemisia was formal . She sat erect in a high wooden chair . I sat almost as erect in a chair that was not quite as high as hers . " So is my army , and so am I. " " I shall tell that to the lord of all the lands . " " You can also tell him that when Artemisia says that she is his , she really is . But not for the harem . For the battlefield . " I must have looked as surprised as I was . But Artemisia was perfectly placid in her belligerence . " Yes , I am willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any battle that the Great King sees fit to fight . I had hoped to join the spring offensive against Athens , but I was rejected by Artaph-renes . " " So now we console each other , " said Mardonius . " Two generals without a war to fight . " Artemisia was somewhat too masculine for my taste . Physically , she was a well-fleshed woman , but the fair hard face that she turned toward me was that of a Scythian warrior . All she lacked was the mustache . Yet Mardonius told me that of the many hundreds of women that he had known , she was the most satisfying to make love to . One never knows what others are really like . We spoke of the war in Greece . We had heard no news since Artaphrenesburned the city of Eretria and enslaved its inhabitants . Presumably , he had occupied Athens by now . Thanks to Mardonius ' removal of the Ionian tyrants , the democratic element at Athens was pro-Persian , and the city was not expected to put up much resistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either pro-Persian or in Persia 's pay or both . As I spoke of our victory at Eretria , Mardonius fell silent and Artemisialooked concerned . This was not a subject calculated to delight our wounded lion . She cut short my profound analysis of the military sihia/tion in Greece : " We have heard that you were recently married to the daughter of the Great King . " Mardonius brightened . " Yes , he 's my cousin now . One day he 's a sort of Magian , guzzling haoma , and the next day he 's a member of the imperial family . " " I am not a Magian . " I never cease to be annoyed when people say this , as Mardonius knew . Boyhood friends are like that , when they are not open enemies . " So he says . But let him near a fire altar and he 'll grab the sacred twigs and chant the  --  " " Which of the noble ladies is mother to your wife ? " Firmly , Artemisia silenced Mardonius . " The Queen Atossa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great , for whom I was named . " I was somewhat surprised that Artemisiadid not already know my wife 's name . But perhaps she did ; and chose to pretend that she did not . " We are so far away , here by the sea , " she said . " Do you know that I have never been up to Susa ? " " You 'll come with me when I go back to court . " Mardonius slowly raised and lowered his bad leg , exercising the muscles . " I do n't think that would be tactful . " Artemisia gave us one of her rare smiles ; she looked womanly , even handsome . " What is this great lady your wife 's name ? " " Parmys , " I answered . Democritus wants to know more about my marriage . He is intrigued by my wife 's name . So was I. After listening to Atossa castigate Darius ' wife Parmys , I could not believe my ears when the court chamberlain told me that I was to marry Atossa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name , which he did , adding , " She is the most beautiful of Queen Atossa 's daughters . " That is a conventional court expression , which means if not the opposite , nothing at all . When I asked if she was called Parmys after the daughter of the usurper , the chamberlain could not or would not answer . Atossa was less than enlightening . " Parmys is a significant name for an Achaemenid , that 's all . You 'll find her very bad-tempered but intelligent . Two qualities I would n't want in a wife , if I were a man , which I 'm not , worse luck . Anyway , it is who not what she is that matters . Take her . If she becomes too disagreeable , beat her . " I took her . I beat her once . It did no good . Parmys was a woman of furious temper and strong will , an Atossa gone entirely wrong . Physically , she resembled Darius . But features that looked handsome when arranged on the Great King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were married she was eighteen , and horrified to get me for a husband . At the least , she had expected one of The Six ; at the most , the crown of some neighboring kingdom . Instead , she was wife to ap294mere king 's eye . To make matters worse , she was a dedicated devilworshiperand would stop her ears at any mention of Zoroaster . She so offended me on one occasion that I struck her as hard as I could with the back of my hand . She fell across a low table and broke her left wrist . It is said that a woman will love a man who treats her violently . This proved not to be true in the case of Parmys . From that moment on , she hated me more than ever . For several years I had my own establishment at Susa , and Parmys shared the women 's quarters with Lais , who , needless to say , liked her very much . There is no end to Lais ' perversity . I kept no concubines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took no more wives . So the two ladies were much together . I have never had any desire to know what they talked about . I can imagine their conversations all too well . After a daughter was born dead , I stopped seeing Parmys . When Xerxes became Great King , I asked him to take her back , which he did . She died while I was in Cathay . This is a very unhappy story , Democritus , and I see no point in dwelling on it . I questioned Artemisia about her relations with the satrap . As king 's eye , I was intent on righting wrongs and making a certain amount of necessary trouble . Artemisia answered my questions with serene good humor . " We have an excellent relationship . He never comes to see me and I never go to see him . I pay tribute directly to the treasury at Susa , and the treasurer seems content . He has visited me several times . " " Who is treasurer ? " Mardonius liked to pretend that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chancellery on the ground that he was too great for mere clerks . But he knew , as we all did , that the empire is governed by the clerks in the chancellery and by the eunuchs in the harem . " Baradkama , " I said . " He is thought to be honest . I know that he demands complete accounts of what is spent at Persepolis , and if a single consignment of cedarwood is not accounted for , heads roll . " " I wish I were as well served , " said Artemisia . " In my small way . " Suddenly a lyre was struck in the next room . Mardonius groaned ; and Artemisia sat very straight in her chair . In the doorway stood a tall fair-haired man , dressed as a beggar . He held a lyre in one hand and a walking stick in the other . Rather clumsily , he played the lyre with the hand that held the stick . As he approached us he tapped the floor with his stick , the way so many blind men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the blind are able to sense the presence of an obstacle before they come to it . I do n't know the explanation for this , but it is a fact . As a result , I seldom stumble , much less walk into a wall . Nevertheless , certain blind men  --  usually beggars  --  like to advertise their infirmity by tapping a stick in front of them as they walk . " Hail , O Queen ! " The blind man 's voice was loud and not at allp295pleasing . " And hail to thee , 0 noble Lords ! Let a humble bard delight you with the songs of his ancestor , blind Homer , who sprang from yonder mountain-crossed fast-river-blessed Cos . Yea , I am of the blood of him who sang of those Argives who sailed gainst high-gated Troy . Yea , I , too , sing the songs that Homer sang , tales of beauteous Helen and false Paris , of doomed Patroclus and his testy catamite Achilles , of lordly Priam and his calamitous fall ! Attend me ! " With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment of an imperfectly strung lyre . Not only was the singer 's voice unpleasant , it was deafening . Oddest of all was the song that he sang . Like all Greek-speakers , I know by heart quantities of Homer and I recognized many of the verses that fell  --  no , were ejected  --  from the blind man 's lips like stones launched by a sling . First he would sing us a verse from Homer 's Iliad , crudely emphasizing the six stresses to the line . Then he would sing an entirely new verse whose seven stresses to the line often contradicted entirely the meaning of what had gone before . I had the sensation that I was dreaming the sort of dream that one sometimes has after too large a Lydian dinner . When , finally , the bard stopped , Mardonius lay as still as a dead man while Artemisia sat rigid in her chair and the king 's eye gaped  --  or , perhaps , stared is the better word . " Lord Cyrus Spitama , " said Artemisia , " let me present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a low bow . " A humble bard takes pleasure in singing for an Argive lord . " " Actually , I 'm Persian , " I said , rather stupidly . " I mean , I 'm halfGreekof course ... " " I could tell ! The eyes ! The brow ! The commanding presence , so like Achilles ! " " Then you 're not blind ? " " No . But I am a true bard , descended from Homer , who lived across those straits . " He pointed at the window . Although Homer was born not on Cos , but on Chios , I said nothing . " His music flows through me . " " So I heard . " I was polite . Then I remembered his characterization of Achilles . " Surely Achilles was older than Patroclus , and surely , neitherone was a catamite . Were n't they lovers in the Greek fashion ? " " You must allow a certain license to my inspiration , noble lord . Also , it is no secret that my ancestor believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pigres is Homer born again , " said Artemisia . I could not tell if she was serious . Mardonius now lay with his back to us ; he snored . " The Persian Odysseus sleeps , " Pigres whispered . " And so we must speak softly , " he said , raising his voice . " But , oh , it is a long way from here to his home in Ithaca , where his wife Penelope plans to put him to death because she likes being queen of I t haca , her harem filled with men . "  | " But surely Penelope was happy to receive Odysseus and  --  " I stopped . Rather late , I had got the point . Pigres was raving mad . It has been said that Pigres only pretended madness because he feared Artemisia , who had seized the crown that was lawfully his at the time of their father 's death . If this story is true , then what had begun as a performance had ended as reality . Wear a mask too long and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artemisia 's rule , Pigres had reworked the entire Iliad . After each of Homer 's lines , Pigres wrote one of his own . The result was maddening , particularly when sung by him . He also wrote an unusually clever narrative about a battle between some frogs and mice which he modestly attributed to Homer . One summer afternoon he sang me this work in a perfectly pleasant voice and I was very much amused by the sharp way that he mocked all the pretensions of the Aryan warrior class  --  a class to which I do and do not belong . I applaudedhim sincerely . " This is marvelous work ! " " It should be , " he said , tilting back his head and pretending to be blind . " Homer composed it . I merely sing it . I am his voice only . " " You are Homer born again ? " Pigres smiled ; put his fingers to his lips ; tiptoed away . I have often wondered what became of him in Artemisia 's damp sea palace . It was at Halicarnassus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget who brought us the message . Some merchant ship , I suppose . I 've also forgotten exactly what we were told . But I do know that Mardonius and I were both so alarmed that we left Halicarnassus the next morning and together went up to Susa . TO THIS DAY ATHENIANS regard the battle of Marathon as the greatest military victory in the history of warfare . They exaggerate , as usual . What happened was this . Until Datis sacked Eretria and burned the city 's temples , Athens wasp297ready to surrender . The Athenian democratic party was headed by the Alcmaeonids , the clan of our noble Pericles ; and they had let it be known that if Persia would help them drive out the aristocratic party , they were more than willing to acknowledge the Great King as overlord . Precisely what they planned to do with Hippias is not clear . Althoughthe democratic party had often been allied with the Pisistratids , the age of the tyrants was at an end and even the word itself was now accursed , a word that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never understood why the tyrants fell into such disrepute . But then , the Greeks are the most volatile and fickle of all races because they are so easily bored . They can not bear for things to go on as they are . In their eyes , nothing old can be good , while nothing new can be bad  --  until it is old . They like radical change in everything except their notion of themselves as a deeply religious people , which they are not . Persians are the opposite . Great Kings may come and go , often bloodily , but the institution of kingship is as immutable with us as it is in India and Cathay . When Datis destroyed the city of Eretria , he lost the war . Had he made an alliance with the democrats of Eretria , they would have offeredDarius earth and water , and then , with Eretrian backing , he could have moved on to Athens , where he would have been made welcome . Democritus thinks that even if Eretria had not been destroyed , the Athenians would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Athens ' greatest commander , Themistocles , was expelled by the people that he had saved , he came up to Susa . I often talked to him about the Greeks in general and the Athenians in particular . Themistocles was confident that had Eretria been spared , the battle of Marathon would never have been fought . But when Eretria was destroyed , the panicky Athenians called upon their allies to come to their defense . As usual , the Spartans sent their regrets . This belligerent race is remarkably ingeniousat finding excuses for not honoring military alliances . Apparently the moon was full  --  or not full  --  or whatever . Although I have never investigated the matter , I would not be surprised if the Persian treasury had paid the Spartan kings to stay home . Baradkama , the treasurer , used to complain that of all those who received secret funds from the treasury , the Spartans were the greediest and the least reliable . Only the Plateans answered the desperate call of the Athenians . And so , just opposite the narrow channel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their stand in the plain of Marathonunder the leadership of the former tyrant Miltiades . With consummatepolitical skill , this one-time vassal of the Great King had managed to get himself elected general of Athens , in the conservative interest . Naturally , he was hated by the democrats . But thanks to Datis ' mistake ut Eretria , both factions rallied around him and our forces were stopped . No , I will not fight again a battle which , at this very moment ,  |p298in  every tavern of the city , old men relive at joyous length . I will say that Athenian losses were as great as Persian losses . But who in Athens believes that such a thing could be true ? In good order , our troops boarded the ships . Then Datis ordered the fleet to sail straight to the Piraeus . He hoped to be able to seize Athens before the Greek army returned from Marathon . As Datis ' fleet rounded Cape Sunium , the Alcmaeonids signaled him that the city was empty and that he should attack . But just off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the winds fell , the Athenian army was within the city and the Persian expedition was at an end . Datis sailed for home . In Halicarnassus we knew nothing more than the fact that Datis and Artaphrenes had been turned back . I have never seen Mardonius in such good spirits . He started to put on weight , and from time to time he even forgot to limp . " Next year I 'll be in command , " he said as we rode out of Halicarnassus . The smell of fermenting grapes was heavy in the air , and dark seething olives were thick upon the ground . " They 've had their chance , " he crowed . " And failed ! I should 've known . Years ago the sybil at Delos said I would die master of all Greece . " He turned to me , face glowing . " You can come with me . I 'll make you governor of Athens . . . No , that wo n't do . You do n't want to be governor of a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I prefer India , " I said . As it turned out , neither dream was fulfilled . Darius was furious at Datis ' failure . Out of loyalty to the elder Artaphrenes , Darius never blamed the younger . He simply put him on the inactive list  --  to Xerxes ' delight . But when the crown prince asked if he might lead the next expedition against Athens , the Great King said that there was not enough money . He would need time to fill the treasury , build a new fleet , train more armies . The last years of Darius ' life were unexpectedly peaceful . He had now accepted the fact that he would never again lead an army . He had also come to believe , wrongly , that there were no generals whose competencehe could trust . Although Mardonius was still Darius ' favorite , the Great King liked to treat his ambitious nephew as a man of his own age , with the same sort of infirmities . " What a pair we are , " Darius would say in the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging to Mardonius ' arm . " Two old soldiers who 've seen their day . Look at that leg of yours ! I 'd cut it off if it were mine . Nothing wrong with a wooden leg , once your fighting days are over . And they 're over for us . Oh , it 's sad ! " Darius enjoyed torturing Mardonius . I ca n't think why . After all , he liked his nephew better than any man of my generation . I suppose that when Darius realized that he himself would never fight again , hep299wanted Mardonius to join him in his redundancy  --  and grief . Yes , it was grief that one saw in the old Darius ' eyes when he watched the young officers at their exercises . Mardonius was less than pleased to be removed from the roster of the active . Once , in the gardens at Ecbatana , I saw him do a ghastly jig to show Darius how well his leg had healed . Actually , Mardonius was never able to walk properly again . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no trouble at all in his war chariot , where he was strapped into place so that the bad leg bore no weight at all . The court during Darius ' last years was lively  --  and dangerous  --  with plots and counterplots . I ca n't say I remember that aspect of those days with much pleasure . For one thing , I had nothing to do . After being complimented on my work as king 's eye , I was relieved of my duties and given no new post . Yet I was never out of favor . I was still Darius ' son-in-law . I still bore the title king 's friend . What had happened was what so often happens at a court . I was no longer of any use to the sovereign . Also , I think that whenever Darius saw me in attendance , he was reminded of those cows that he had once dreamed of  --  and now would never herd . No one enjoys being reminded of all that he has not accomplished in his life . It was apparent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end . That is , in theory we realized that he would not live much longer , but in fact none of us could conceive of a world without him . Darius had been Great King all our lives . We had known no other . Even Xerxes could not really imagine himself in Darius ' place , and it could never be said that Xerxes lacked confidence in his own majesty . Atossa continued to dominate the harem . She had done her best to forward the eastern policy ; and she had failed . But then , no adventurousscheme was apt to appeal to Darius in those last years . He spent most of his time with his inner council . Daily he saw the guards commanderAspathines and the treasurer Baradkama . Darius was putting his house in order . The sudden death of Gobryas cleared the air . In fact , some weeks after Gobryas ' death , the former crown prince Artobazanes retired from court and moved to Sidon . He never came up to Susa again . Atossa had now lived long enough to witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks were less in evidence than usual , Demaratus had become an intimate of Darius . No doubt Lais ' witchcraft had been more than usually effective . Certainly , it was to her credit that he was tiow much cleaner than before , and no longer smelled like a caged fox . The other Greeks were either dead or out of favor . Xerxes continued to build palaces . There was nothing else for him to do except , secretly , to assemble the men and eunuchs that he would need to serve him once Darius was dead . It was at about this time thatp300Xerxes took up with Artabanus , a young Persian officer distantly related to the Otanes clan . Artabanus was poor ; and he was ambitious . In due course Xerxes would give him the command of his personal guard , while from the second room of the chancellery Xerxes took as personal chamberlain Aspamitres , a eunuch of unusual charm . Xerxes and Mardonius were once again as close as  --  I was going to say brothers , but in a royal family , kinship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , they were friends once more and it was understood that Mardonius would be Xerxes ' chief general . So , with great subtlety and much care , Xerxes selected the men who would contrive his ruin . Even with hindsight , I can not say that any of his appointments was wrong in itself . Ultimately , there is good luck and bad luck . My friend 's luck was bad  --  something he knew at the time , but I did not . During the last year of Darius ' life , I met several times with the Egibis in order to send out a private caravan to India . But something always went wrong . At about this time , I received a message from Caraka . He had sent a second convoy of iron from Magadha to Persia . Unfortunately , somewhere between Taxila and Bactra , the caravan vanished . I assume that the Scythians seized it . Before I left India , Caraka and I had worked out a private code . As a result , I was able to learn from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer existed , that Virudhaka was dead , that Ajatashatru was the master of the Gangeticplain . Since Prince Jeta was in good favor with Ajatashatru , my wife and two sons  --  the second child was a boy , too  --  were safe . Beyond that , I knew nothing . I missed Ambalika , particularly on those rare occasions when I was with Parmys . Five years after Fan Ch'ih 's departure , he sent me a message . He was still not in Cathay . But he said that the caravan was making progress . He had found a new approach to Cathay , and he had high hopes of opening up a silk road between Cathay and Persia . I read the letter to Xerxes , who was sufficiently interested to send on a copy to the Great King . A month later I received a formal acknowledgment from the councilor for the east , then  --  silence . In a sense , Mardonius was responsible for the death of Darius . As Mardonius regained his health , he became once more the center of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly wooed by Demaratus . Incidentally , I forbade Lais to receive any Greek in my house . While I was home , she obeyed me . But whenever I was away from Susa , every Greek hanger-on at court converged upon my house and there was nothing that I could do about it , short of expelling Lais  --  not the sort of thing one does to a Thracian witch . Mardonius wanted a final Greek war , while Xerxes wanted a victory in the field , any field . Mardonius tempted Xerxes with glory . Together , they would conquer Greece . Xerxes would be overall commander ; Mardoniushis second in command . Since there was no longer any talk ofp301India , I was excluded from their councils . I was not unhappy . I had always disapproved of the Greek wars because I knew the Greeks . Xerxes did not . It is my impression that Darius wanted peace . Although , at the time , he had been angry with Datis for failing to destroy Athens , he certainly did not brood over the matter . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city seriously . How could he , when their leading men were forever coming up to Susa to beg him to help them betray their native cities ? Although Darius admired the Greeks as soldiers , he was deeply bored by their quarrels with one another . Finally he said , " Two campaigns are enough . " The first had been an unqualified success , while the second had been not only inconclusive but expensive . There was no need for a third campaign . But that did not stop Mardonius . He brought pressure to bear on everyone , including Queen Atossa , who agreed , finally , that the time had come for Xerxes to take the field . The retirement of Artobazanes had done much to allay her fears , and Xerxes seemed to have no rival . These combined pressures on Darius proved to be disastrously success-The Great King summoned us to the hall of seventy-two columns at Susa . Although I had no presentiment that this would be Darius ' last public appearance , I do remember thinking how changed he was from the vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . Where once a lion had moved amongst us , a fragile old man now crept toward the throne . The Great King was in his sixty-fourth year . Democritus wants to know how old Xerxes was at the time . Xerxes , Mardonius and I were all thirty-four . Herodotus thinks that Xerxes was only eighteen . So much for what is called history . Although our youth had left us , old age was as far away as childhood . As Xerxes helped his father into the high gold throne , every eye was on the failing sovereign and his successor . Darius wore the spiked war crown . In his right hand he clutched the gold sceptre . As discreetly as possible , Xerxes picked up his father 's useless left arm and place it on the arm of the throne . Xerxes stepped down from the throne . " The king of kings , " he said in a voice that carried throughout the hall . " The Achaemenid ! " We stood erect , hands in our sleeves . Looking at the row of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself and Milo so many years ago . Now a new set of youths had replaced us , just as Xerxes would soon replace the diminished figure on the throne . There is nothing like the unchanging court of Persia to remind one of tinI ' ' S impartial passage . When Darius spoke , the voice was weak but carefully pitched . " The Wise Lord requires us to punish the Athenians who burned our holy temples at Sardis. "  |p302This  was the formula that the chancellery always used to justify any expedition against the western Greeks . More than once , I remonstrated with the chamberlain . I also spoke to Xerxes . I did everything possible to get them to change the formula , but the chancellery is like the proverbial mountain which can not be budged . When I told them that the Wise Lord would have wanted those temples destroyed by the Greeks or by anyone else , no one at the chancellery paid the slightest attention to me . I also got no help from the Zoroastrian community . In order to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  --  quite happy to be the most ignored . They have long since disregarded my grandfather 's command to convert all those who follow the Lie . To be honest , so have I. Only the community at Bactra is still relatively pure , and militant . " We have ordered six hundred triremes to be built . We are levying troops from every part of the empire . We are increasing the tribute that each of the satrapies must pay . " Darius pointed the sceptre at Baradkama , who then read the tax roll . There was a soft sighing sound in the hall as each of the nobles noted those tax increases that affected him or his estates . Although the Persian clans are exempt from taxes of any kind , they are expected to provide those troops that form the core of the Persian army . In a sense , it is the Persians who pay most dearly when the Great King goes to war . Once the treasurer was finished , Darius resumed . " Our son and heir Xerxes will lead the expedition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a command ; yet his face did not change expression . " Our nephew Mardonius will command the fleet . " This was a surprise . Everyone had expected Mardonius to be appointedsecond in command . Perhaps the post of admiral implied as much ; perhaps it did not . The Great King chose not to elaborate . I looked at Mardonius , who stood to the right of the throne . Mardonius ' lips curved beneath his sculptured beard . He was happy . I was not . I would go to Greece with Xerxes . If I survived the campaign , I might one day return to India and visit Ambalika and our sons . I confess that I was deeply depressed . I saw no future for Persia in the west . More to the point , I saw no future for me except in the east . The collapse of my marriage to Parmys had made Ambalika seem all the more desirable to me . Democritus wants to know why I never took other wives . The answer is simple : I lacked the money . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought that one day I would either settle in Shravasti with Ambalika or bring her and  --  most important  --  my sons back to Persia . At the end of the audience , Darius used his right arm to push himself to his feet . For a moment he stood , swaying slightly ; the weight of the Great King 's body rested entirely on the right leg . When Xerxes made a move to help him , Darius gestured for him to stand back . Then Darius began the slow , hesitant , painful descent from the throne.  |p303On  the last step of the dais , Darius swung the weakened left leg forward onto what he took to be the floor . But he had miscalculated . There was still one more step . Rather like a tall gilded door slamming shut , the Great King swung toward us on his right leg and slowly  --  very slowly , so it seemed to the stunned court  --  he fell face down upon the floor . Although he still clasped in one hand the sceptre , the crown fell off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lethal gold was rolling straight toward me . I threw myself on my belly . Since there was no precedent for what had happened , we all played dead , did not dare stir as Xerxes and the court chamberlain helped Darius to his feet . As the Great King was half carried , half dragged past me , I could hear his heavy breathing and I could see upon the dull redwash floor a trail of bright fresh blood . He had cut his lip ; he had broken his good arm . The Great King had begun to die . There was no Greek war that year or the next . The war was postponednot because of Darius ' disability but because Egypt chose to go into rebellion rather than pay the new tax levies . And so the army that the Great King had raised for the conquest of Greece was now to be used for the pacification and punishment of Egypt . From one end of the earth to the other , heralds proclaimed that Darius would lead the army in the spring , and Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court was at sultry Babylon and Susa was buried beneath the worst blizzard in anyone 's memory , the Great King died at the age of sixty-four . He had reigned for thirty-six years . Death took Darius in  --  of all places  --  Queen Atossa 's bedchamber . They had quarreled . That is , he had wanted to quarrel with Atossa , or so she said . " I tried to keep the peace , as always . " I was in her private apartment at Babylon . This was the day before we were all to go to Pasargada for Darius ' funeral and Xerxes ' coronation . " I knew how ill he was . He did , too . Even so , he was in a terrible rage , supposedly at me but really at himself . He could not bear his own weakness , and I could n't blame him for that . I ca n't bear mine , either . Anyway , he came to me , secretly , in a lady 's litter with curtains drawn . He could no longer walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay there . " Atossa pointed to a place between her chair and me . " I knew he was dying . But I do n't think he knew . One does n't , you know . At a certain point when one is ill , all notion of time stops and you think you 'll never die because you 're still here , not dead . You are , and that is all . Nothing will change . " I tried to divert him . We used to play at riddles when we were  --  nuig . Oddly enough , he liked word games , the more elaborate the better . So I tried to distract him , proposed several games . But he was not  --  to be distracted . I le criticized Xerxes . I said nothing . Ile criticizedp304me . I said nothing . I know my place . " Atossa was given to exaggeration for effect . " Then Darius praised our son Ariamenes . He is the best of all my satraps . Thanks to him the northern tribes were driven out of Bactra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those savages . I want Ariamenes to lead the army into Egypt . I 've sent for him . ' I 'm afraid I could n't keep still at that point . Xerxes was promised the spring command , ' I said . And Xerxes is your heir . ' Then Darius started to cough . I can still hear that awful sound . " To my surprise , tears were streaming down Atossa 's face ; yet the voice was perfectly steady . " I should like to say that our last meeting was peaceful . But it was not . Darius could never forget that the only legitimacy he had on this earth was through me , and he hated his dependency . I ca n't think why . He may have got the crown through cunning , but with the crown he got me , too , and because of me he was the father of Cyrus ' grandson . What more could the man want ? I do n't know . I always found him hard to fathom . But then , I saw very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was unsettled by illness . I could see that . Even so , I never thought that he would send for Ariamenes . You 'll start a civil war , ' I said . Ariamenes will want to succeed you . But we wo n't let him . That is a promise , ' I said . Oh , I was hard . And Darius was furious . He tried to threaten me , but could not . The coughing had left him without any breath . But he glared at me , and made the sign of a knife cutting a throat . That gesture so infuriated me that I threatenedhim . If you encourage Ariamenes , I swear to you that I shall go myself to Pasargada . I shall raise with my own hands the standard of the Achaemenid . I shall summon the clans and we will make the eldest grandson of Cyrus our Great King . ' Then ... " Atossa sat back in her chair . " Darius raised his right arm and made a fist . Then the arm fell on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looked at me the way he used to look at strangers . Remember ? Polite , but ever so distant . Then he stopped breathing , all the while staring at me , ever so politely . " Atossa blinked eyes that were now sand-dry . Then she was all business . " Ariamenes is on the march to Susa . There will be civil war . " But thanks to Xerxes , there was no civil war . The day after Darius ' death , Xerxes left Babylon at the head of the ten thousand immortals . He took possession of the palace at Susa , and the treasury . From Susa he sent his father-in-law Otanes to confer with Ariamenes . I have never known the full details of that meeting . I do know that Ariamenes was won over without bloodshed . I assume that he was heavily bribed . In any case , as a proof of good will , he agreed to attend the coronation of Xerxes at Pasargada . I must say that it is very much to Xerxes ' credit that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , leniency is usually a mistake , since the man who can forgive the manp305who forgives him is rare indeed . But Ariamenes proved to be an exception . He was loyal to his brother . Later he died a hero 's death in the Greek wars . At the beginning Xerxes understood men ; and their vanity . ON A BRIGHT COLD DAY the body of Darius was placed in the rock tomb next to old Hystaspes and the unfortunate Parmys  --  whose remains were soon to be stands just opposite the tomb of Cyrus . The rest of us waited outside . I have never been so cold . It was the sort of icy day that makes the hairs in one 's nostrils freeze , while the sun blazes with the sort of intense light that gives no heat . I remember that the sky was perfectly clear except for the white plumes of smoke that rose from the fires where a thousand hulls would soon be offered up to the Wise Lord . Inside the temple , Magians presented Xerxes with a simple dish of sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional food , he put on the gold-embroidered Median cloak of Cyrus . Then Ariamenes pre sented Xerxes with Cyrus ' war crown , which he held in his hands until the Arch-Magian indicated the exact moment of the winter solstice . At that propitious instant Xerxes placed the crown upon his head and became Great King . Actually , the winter solstice had occurred earlier that clay , but Magians are seldom precise in such matters , worse luck . When Xerxes appeared at the door of the temple , we cheered him until our voices broke . I have never been so moved as I was that winter day when my lifelong friend stood before us , wearing the cloak of Cyrus and holding high the lotus and the scepter . I remember thinking that the gold-turreted crown on Xerxes ' head looked like an earthly  --  no , unearthly  --  fragment of the sun itself . So the reign began . The court stayed at Persepolis for a month . During this time I draftedp306his first proclamation . It is carved on a cliff not far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with praise of himself , in imitation of those ancient Elamite kings who are forever threatening the reader or listener with their awesome might . But I persuaded Xerxes to imitate his father , who had begun his first proclamation by praising the Wise Lord . Needless to say , I was under great pressure from the entire Zoroastriancommunity . When Xerxes finally agreed to acknowledge the primacy of the Wise Lord , I found myself for the first and only time in my life popular with every one of my numerous uncles , cousins , nephews . Several years later they were even more pleased when I persuaded Xerxes to drop all pretense that he ruled in Babylon and in Egypt at the pleasure of the local gods . " A great god is the Wise Lord , who created this earth , who created man , who created peace for man  --  " That last phrase was Xerxes ' own contribution , not mine . Unlike most rulers , he never enjoyed war for its own bloody sake . "  --  who made Xerxes king , one king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Then we listed all the lands that he governed . Although the recent disturbance in Bactria was mentioned in a somewhat minatory way , no mention was made of the revolt in Egypt . That was too delicate a matter . I was also able to persuade Xerxes to denounce the devas and their worshipers in far stronger terms than Darius had ever used . But Xerxes somewhat spoiled the effect by celebrating a characteristic of the Wise Lord called Arta  --  or righteousness . Now , if one regards Arta as simply an aspect of the single deity , no blasphemy has been committed . But in recent years the commonpeople  --  encouraged by certain Magians  --  have tended to regard mere aspects of the Wise Lord as separate deities . I 'm afraid that Xerxes himself inclined to this heresy . He prayed quite as much to Arta as he ever did to the Wise Lord . He even named his son , our present Great King , Arta-Xerxes . When Xerxes announced that the court would remain at Persepolis for a month , I was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time from the harem . When I alluded to this , he smiled . " You do n't know what a relief it is not to be advised by Atossa and Amestris . " He also thought it auspicious that his reign should begin in the heart of the Persian homeland , surrounded by clan leaders . At the coronation feast , fifteen thousand of the empire 's most importantmen dined in the main courtyard of Darius ' winter palace . I once saw the list of the animals slaughtered for that particular feast . I do n't think a single sheep or goose or bull was left alive in all the highlands . But despite the vast expense , the affair was highly auspicious , or so we thought . The grandees ate and drank for nine hours . Many were ill . All were ecstatic . The awesome royal glory had passed , in the most suitable way , to the true Achaemenid . This does not often happen.  |p307Xerxes  himself dined with his brothers in a curtained alcove just off a hall where sat one hundred king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcove from the room where we feasted . Later the curtain was drawn back and he drank with us . Later still , he went out into the courtyard and the cheering of the clans sounded like ocean waves when they strike the shore , rhythmically , in accordance with the moon . Yes , Democritus , beneath the surface of the outer seas , there are powerful tides of a sort that do not exist in the Mediterranean , where waves are caused by capricious winds . No , I do not know the reason for this . Somehow , ocean tides follow the waxing and the waning of the moon , in much the same way that the periods of women do . I sat between Mardonius and Artabanus . We were as drunk as everyone else . Only Xerxes remained sober . He mixed water with his wine , something that he rarely did . He was on his guard . After all , at the foot of his golden couch sat Ariamenes . The would-be usurper was a sturdy youthful man , with the arms of an ironworker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except Xerxes . I found Artabanus highly agreeable . I can not say that I took him very seriously , even though I knew that Xerxes was about to make him commander of the palace guard  --  a position of enormous power , since the guards commander not only protects the Great King but supervises the day-to-day maintenance of the court . Because Darius had always kept his guards commanders on a short leash , I assumed that Xerxes would do the same . Artabanus was a blond blue-eyed Hyrcanian a year or two younger than Xerxes . It was rumored that he liked to drink distilled barley from a human skull . Whatever his private habits , his public manners were most civilized . Certainly , he was deferential with me . I 'm afraid that I found him dull , which was just the impression that he wanted to make on us all . As it turned out , we were the dullards , not he . The guards commander at the Persian court is usually kept in check lry the court chamberlain . The wise sovereign does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is not hard to do . Since the chamberlain must have access to the harem , he is always a eunuch . Since virile soldiers are contemptuous of all eunuchs , a satisfactory host i lity is bound to exist between guards commander and court chamDerluin . On the recommendation of Amestris , Xerxes had already appointedAspamitres court chamberlain . All in all , the court was pleased . Everyone knew that when Aspamitres took a bribe , he gave good value nr return . He was also an excellent administrator , as I discovered on the of ' Xerxes ' coronation . At about the third course , Mardonius and I were moderately drunk . I remember that the dish before us was venison , cooked exactly the way I like  --  basted with vinegar and served with cock 's combs . I had
