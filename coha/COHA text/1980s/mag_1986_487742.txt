THE ENCHANTER . By Vladimir Nabokov . Translated by Dmitri Nabokov . G.P. Putnam 's Sons . 127 pp. $16.95. n the 1962 foreword to The Gift , written between 1935 and 1937 while he was living in Berlin and then in southern France , Vladimir Nabokov declared : " It is the last novel I wrote , or ever shall write , in Russian . " By 1937 he was already at work on his first English novel , The Real Life of Sebastian Knight , which was published in 1941 , the year after the Nabokovs left Paris for the United States . The Gift is generally regarded as not only the last but also the greatest of Nabokov 's Russian novels . Publication now , nine years after its author 's death , of The Enchanter ( Volshebnik ) , will alter neither assessment . It is only by a considerable stretch of the generic imagination that The Enchanter could be considered a novel , and by an ingenious allocation of pages that it has become a book . With generous margins and chapter breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five pages in the original typescript . The ? text is supplemented by : an excerpt from the afterword to Lolita that Nabokov first published in French , in 1956 ; part of a letter we are told he sent to his American publisher in 1959 ; a translator 's note ; and a lengthy postscript by the translator , who also happens to be the author 's only son . Shades of Charles Kinbote , the psychopathic assembler of scholarly apparatuses in Pale Fire ? Portions of the original Russian typescript , along with Vladimir Nabokov 's handwritten corrections , are , we are informed , reproduced as the endpapers of this posthumous discovery . I ascribe no sinister significance to the fact that Dmitri Nabokov was born the same year , 1934 , that his father published a novel titled Despair . And I have no reason to doubt the filial translator 's curious insistence that " no literary adventurer would have a leg to stand on if he were to question the authorship of The Enchanter . " I do not invite ampUtation , but I do note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are instructed not only that Dmitri Nabokov " races boats and cars , climbs mountains , and skis , " but also that " he is writing a pseudonymous novel . " " Play ! Invent the world ! Invent reality ! " urges the Baroness Bredow in Look at the Harlequins ! ( 1974 ) . And its sly author , whose Invitation to a Beheading ( 1938 ) begins with an invented epigraph by an invented Frenchman , one Pierre Delalande , delighted in pulling the legs of his readers , even out from under them . He might have enjoyed the suspicion that Dmitri , who was a 5-year-old in 1939 , when The Enchanter is said to have been written , is using Vladimir Nabokov as his pseudonym . The coy master himself appended the name V. Sirin to his earliest fiction , including , according to Dmitri , The Enchanter . It would be delicious to believe that The Enchanter is the greatest familial literary hoax since Thomas Hardy wrote his own biography and signed it with the name of Florence Emily Hardy , his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to believe that The Enchanter is not beirig published merely as the fossilized droppings of a literary lion , that it would be of compelling interest even if written by an unknown . Thanks to the industry of his heirs and devotees , Vladimir Nabokov has been as prolific posthumously as many authors are prehumously . The Nabokov-Wilson Letters ( 1979 ) , Lectures on Literature ( 1980 ) , Lectures on Russian Literature ( 1981 ) and Lectures on Don Quixote ( 1984 ) are spirited encores from beyond the grave . But The Enchanter is a novella whose chief appeal is as a rehearsal for Lolita , Nabokov 's own favorite . It is , in brief , the story of a 40-yearold man who asks himself : " What if the way to true bliss is indeed through a still delicate membrane , before it has had - time to harden , become overgrown , lose the fragrance and the shimmer through which one penetrates to the throbbing star of that bliss ? " He becomes so enamored of a roller-skating 12-yearold nymphet he encounters in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain access to her . When the mother finally dies , he whisks the child off to a rural hotel , where a pathetic attempt to take possession of her ends in disaster . In the appendix to Lolita ( " On a Book Entitled Lolita " ) Nabokov describes its prototype as a " short story some thirty pages long " in which " the man was a central European , the anonymous nymphet was French ; and the loci were Paris and Provence . " Not only is The Enchanter a few pages longer than remembered , but its local habitations and names are refined into abstraction . The main character could be studying to be- Humbert Humbert , but , though Nabokov recalls him as " Arthur " in his 1950s afterword , he remains anonymous , and moves in a vaguely European , but unspecified , setting , throughout The Enchanter : Lolita begins with a celebrated apostrophe to its elusive eponym by playing on her name : Lolita , light of my life , fire of my loins . My sin , my soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three steps down the palate to tap , at three , on the teeth . Lo . Lee . Ta . ( " Oh , my Lolita , " Humbert later laments , " I have only words to play with ! " ) However , the fille fatale of UrLolita is given neither a name nor a nationality . The Enchanter is Lolita without first-person narration , without the landscape of American popular culture , without Clare Quilty , without the inventive brio and without the exquisite tragicomedy . What the two works do have in common is the once risque , now reprobate theme of child molestation . And , though one was written in English and the other , Dmitri asserts , in Russian , they share the language of the baroque . When Vladimir Nabokov advertised the lost Russian novella to Putnam 's as " a beautiful piece of Russian prose , precise and lucid , " he was being arch in hopes of a contractual triumph . At least in its English version , which offers us " fleeting glimpses of incidental ephemera , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Niceties of style prevent us from ascertaining essential facts of the plot , like what exactly is the dire fate that befalls our girl-crazy protagonist when , surprised in sin , he rushes barefoot out into the street . We do not even know his occupation except that it is " a refined , precise , and rather lucrative profession " and " a limpid , elegant profession . " He is given " the keen eye of an appraiser of facets and reflections , " but that could as easily make him an author of Nabokovian prose as a jeweler . It is odd that though Nabokov , in " On a Book Entitled Lolita , " said of its Russian prototype that " I was not pleased with the thing and destroyed it sometime after moving to America in 1940 , " he suddenly , according to the letter reproduced in The Enchanter , found the manuscript on February 6 , 1959 , and offered it the same day for sale to Putnam 's . According to Dmitri , his father never got around to sending them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " The first little throb of Lolita went through me late in 1939 or early in 1940 in Paris , " when earlier , in The Gift , ? migr ? landlord Boris Ivanovich Shchyogolev outlines this plot for a novel he would like to write : an old dog  --  but still in his prime , fiery , thirsting for happiness  --  gets to know a widow , and she has a daughter , still quite a little girl  --  you know what I mean=when nothing is formed yet but already she has a way of walking that drives you out of your mind ? A slip of a girl , very fair , pale , with blue under the eyes  --  and of course she does n't even look at the old goat . What to do ? Well , not long thinking , he ups and marries the widow . . - . . Even with pornographic parody like Lolita , Vladimir Nabokov will always be caveat for the masses . And the fastidious stylist who , in the foreword to The Eye , boasted that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance , " will never be a favorite of those yvho regard fiction as an agent of social change . Asked about expatriate Alexander Solzhenitsyn , Nabokov always lauded the man 's courage but maintained a discreet silence about his artistry . When I taught in the Soviet Union , in 1980 , Nabokov 's work , especially Lolita , was , though proscribed , widely known and admired . Last summer , for the first time since his permanent exile , Nabokov was , published legally in his native land when an excerpt from Speak , Memory appeared in 64 , a chess magazine . I suspect that a Russian edition of The Enchanter will have to wait even longer than did its English version . I eagerly await Dmitri Nabokov 's next book . - ?
