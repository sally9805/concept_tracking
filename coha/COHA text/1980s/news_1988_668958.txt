A U.S. immigration judge ruled Monday that Carmine Esposito , dubbed by authorities as " the Al Capone of Italy , " can be deported from the United States because he entered the country illegally in 1984 . The ruling by Judge Craig Zerbe came one month after the government failed in an attempt to extradite Esposito to his native Italy , where he has been linked to 12 gangland slayings . Phil Parenti , attorney for Esposito , said that if deported , his client would seek to enter Brazil instead of returning to his native Italy , because Brazil does not have an extradition treaty with Italy . But Brian Perryman , deputy district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service , said that under the U.S. immigration law , Esposito would be deported to Italy and not Brazil . Defense lawyers spent the afternoon trying to shoot holes in the criminal charges in an effort to seek permanent residence status for Esposito , whose wife , along with the youngest of their five children , was born in America and is a U.S. citizen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door through extradition , they ' re trying to do through the back door through deportation , " Parenti said in an interview outside the courtroom . " You can only deport someone if he commits a crime here and he hasn ' t committed any crimes here , " Parenti said . " From the time he has been here , he has contributed to the economy hiring 20-something people . His wife and children have gotten accustomed to life here . " Esposito testified Monday that he came to New York in 1984 after purchasing a passport and entry visa for $1 , 000 . He said he burned the passport and purchased identity cards belonging to John Michael Phelan , a Milwaukee man who had lost his wallet . Under the name of Phelan , Esposito worked as a chef and part-owner of Bravissimo , an upscale retaurant at 508 N. Clark St. , a job he held until March 12 , 1987 , when 20 FBI agents and police officers raided the premises and arrested the entrepreneur , who speaks only Italian . Esposito , who allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an organized-crime outfit based in Naples , was charged by federal and Italian authorities with masterminding or carrying out 12 murders . In one murder , the girlfriend of a high-ranking member of Esposito ' s group was slain , tossed in a grave and covered with lime . In another case , a man was slain in his home by a group of men wearing police uniforms . As extradition proceedings dragged on for 19 months , all of the Italian charges against Esposito were dropped because prosecutors in Italy did not bring him to trial within 18 months of his arrest in Chicago , as required by Italy ' s speedy-trial law . During a hearing of more than nine hours on Monday , Italian Magistrate Paulo Mancuso , speaking through an interpreter , testified that Esposito had been convicted in absentia of Mafia connections and had been implicated in the 12 murders , as well as drug and weapons trafficking and extortion . Parenti , heeding the constant counsel of Esposito , sought to portray Italy ' s judicial system as corrupt . Under his questioning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the alleged murders . Parenti also noted that Esposito had not been found guilty of the other charges . " The charges should not be considered because they have not resulted in conviction , " Parenti said . " The charges are completely invalid and they know it . " Parenti also questioned the credibility of testimony made against Esposito by the " pentiti , " defectors from the New Camorra Organization who turned state ' s witnesses . One of them , Parenti said , had been allowed to escape from a prison hospital . Esposito occasionally spoke out during the hearing , saying at one point , " This is not fair . " At another time he said , " I no feel good and I no feel comfortable . " But after the long day in court , Esposito appeared to remain calm . As the hearing ended , he approached the Italian magistrate and proffered a cigarette . The magistrate declined the offer . CAPTION : PHOTO : Suspect may be deported .
