A quick and easy recipe for corporate virtue has long been the common one : Stir up a code of ethics and sprinkle the firm with a few outside directors renowned for their community concern . But a fresh look at data culled from 10 academic studies suggests that these actions merely pay lip service to a larger  --  and clearly unmet  --  problem : a business climate that condones malfeasance . Indeed , the studies together indicate that even the most upright people are apt to become dishonest and unmindful of their civic responsibilities when placed in a typical corporate environment . " The culprit is not personal values but corporate culture , " says William Frederick , a business professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has put the findings together in a soon-to-be-published volume . While Mr. Frederick ' s conclusion isn ' t entirely novel , using statistics to try and prove it is unprecedented . And corporate consultants say they welcome the work as supporting evidence derived from their own experience . Corporate codes of conduct " look good and sound good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Keller , vice president of Fairfax Group Ltd. , a New Mexico-based corporate security firm . Of course , there are those who dispute Mr. Frederick ' s claim about where the blame lies . August Bequai , a Washington lawyer who has written and lectured extensively on white-collar crime , says individual human nature  --  not company philosophy  --  is most responsible for unethical behavior . " If you expect the average businessman to be St. Augustine , " he says , " you ' re kidding yourself . " But the new data  --  tested to ensure reliability by accounting for such factors as dishonest answers  --  appear to bear out Mr. Frederick ' s view . They indicate , for example , that corporations with codes of ethics are actually cited by federal agencies for infractions more often than those that lack such standards . The reason , Mr. Frederick says , is that the codes themselves typically emphasize improving the companies ' balance sheets . A Washington State University survey of ethical codes at 202 Fortune 500 companies found that 75% fail to address the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , three-quarters of the codes fail even to mention some or all of the following : consumer relations , environmental safety and product safety . By contrast , more than three-quarters of the codes deal with conflicts of interest  --  which can affect the bottom line . " The codes are really dealing with infractions against the corporation , rather than illegalities on behalf of the corporation , " says Marilynn Cash Mathews , who conducted the Washington State research . Figures also show that companies that name outsiders to their boards of directors  --  purportedly to add a socially conscious perspective  --  are cited by federal agencies at least as often as those that remain insular . That , consultants say , is because the larger boards are still controlled by profit-driven executive committees . " When you bring in outsiders , you ' re only setting up straw men , " says Mr. Keller , the security consultant . Still , most managers don ' t show up at the office with peccable dispositions . Despite popular images of insatiable greed  --  and U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  middle- and upper-level managers profess to virtuous intentions . Some 220 Pittsburgh-area managers , for example , were asked to review independently a set of 18 values and then pick the ones most important in their lives . On average , self-respect ranked first ; experiencing pleasure came last . When asked to choose among 18 personal attributes , the Pittsburgh sample gave honesty the highest ranking , and obedience the lowest . " You can ' t find any connection between what people are saying and what ' s actually happening in the workplace , " says Mr. Frederick , who performed the Pittsburgh study with a research colleague , James Weber . " People ' s personal values are getting blocked by the needs of the company . " Earlier studies support that idea , Mr. Frederick says . He points , for instance , to work done in the mid-1970s by George England , a business professor long associated with the University of Minnesota . Mr. England found that while 91% of 1 , 072 U.S. managers he interviewed considered " trust " to be important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their careers . ( " Ambition , " on the other hand , was thought important by 75% of the managers , and 73% also said it could help them to be successful . ) Mr. Frederick also cites a survey  --  taken in the early 1980s by Barry Posner of Santa Clara University and Warren Schmidt , a California management consultant  --  that involved interviews with 6 , 000 executives and middle managers . The researchers found that more than 70% from each group said they felt pressure to conform to organizational standards , and often compromised personal principles . For those principles to remain intact on the job , a message of good conduct must come from on high , consultants say . " Nobody can create the moral tone like the chief executive , " says Norman Jaspan , whose New York-based security firm serves scores of Big Board companies . Adds Mr. Keller : " A company is like the military . The law comes down , and then people see how much they can get away with . " Even Mr. Frederick ' s supporters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in real life . Mr. Keller , for one , says he appreciates the fact that consultants soon can be armed with statistical evidence when trying to persuade a company to promote ethics in earnest . But , he concludes , " the Pope could come to some of these places , and I doubt they ' d change.
