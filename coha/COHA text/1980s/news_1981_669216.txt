As Londoners scurry , they talk about the weather , as always , and about the steep new taxes imposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe ( " You name it . . . He ' s taxed it " banner-headlined the conservative Daily Express ) , and about the brightest piece of news here for many months : the royal wedding set for July 29. // " Shy Di " is how the popular Fleet Street press refers to the first fiancee in the land , Lady Diana Spencer  --  though the image was dented somewhat when she appeared for her first gala evening with the Prince of Wales in a striking ( and daring ) strapless black dress which set people talking all over again. // One of the better headlines recently came over a brief item about Lady Diana sitting for her waxwork likeness at Madame Tussaud ' s : " The Di is Cast. " // Economic news generally here is so bad , and complaints so numerous against higher taxes on gasoline , cars , alcohol , tobacco , even motorscooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome relief. // The best wedding gift the US could give the royal couple would be the twang of American accents across the land this summer  --  and the reassuring rustle of dollar bills. // British tourist officials are counting on the pomp and splendor at St. Paul ' s to revive the tourist trade from the US. // Tourism has been down since the peak year of 1978 , when 1 , 964 , 000 Americans came here ( 15. 53 percent of the total tourist flow of 12 , 646 , 000 that year ) . // The number of US visitors fell off by 245 , 000 in 1979 as the strength of sterling made visits steadily more expensive . The figure stayed low last year . But officials hope the wedding will help push overall tourism up by a quarter of a million this summer , and they hope against hope that many of them will be free-spending Americans. // Those who can not come will at least be able to buy Wedgwood and Royal Doulton souvenirs ( candy dishes , loving cups , ceramic statuettes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already asking about orders. // And the stay-at-homes will see wide coverage on color television : At least one network ( CBS ) is moving its morning news program to London for the event . The ABC network has already booked 100 hotel rooms for extra camera crew and reporters. // Those who do come will see one of the biggest spectaculars since the coronation in 1953 and the biggest royal wedding since the marriage of the Prince ' s mother in 1947 . That wedding of a poised young heir to the throne to a dashing naval officer lifted the spirits of war-weary Britain . The July wedding has begun to do the same , 34 years later. // The Prince is not just royal . He is rich  --  of the richest . As Duke of Cornwall he owns 130 , 000 acres in nine counties . In 1979 his income has L500 , 000 ( $1. 2 million ) , half of which went to the Treasury in lieu of income taxes . Since he turned 21 11 years ago , a nest egg of L300 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London financiers. // The properties he owns include Dartmoor Prison , the famed cricket ground at the Oval , thousand of farms , and six or so ancient castles. // If he should ever find himself short of a shilling or two , there are always the 300 puffins he is entitled to claim each year from the Scilly Isles . Or the leg of roast mutton from Fordingham in Hampshire. // He can also fall back on any whales and porpoises that might be washed up on Cornish beaches . He is entitled to claim all of them. // One good thing about being royal  --  it means never having to worry about parking. // The Prince , of course , is driven in a black rolls-Royce the size of a small house . But lesser royals who drive themselves also find overcrowded and jammed London easier than the rest of us. // Visiting the Ministry of Defense on Horseguards Parade off Whitehall the other day , I noticed a splendidly sleek 4. 2 Daimler saloon , in British racing green , casually parked by a policebox . Closer inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvery racing club badges outside , one mounted on the hood complete with miniature Union Jack in enamel on the back. // A discreet inquiry or two , and I learned tht the mouth-watering car belonged to Prince Michael of Kent , visiting another government department at the time. // Did he always park his royal conveyance with such easy abandon ? " He , " came the emphatic reply from the uniformed guardian of the law on duty , " can park anywhere he likes. " // Back in the day-to - day world most British people live in , no one seems happy with the new Conservative budget . It is said that six members of the Cabinet itself have misgivings. // Industry says the minimum lending ( discount ) rate should have dropped by more than 2 percent . Engineers accuse the government of mismanagement . Small businesses say the package of help to them was too little , too late . Unions , of course , are angry at the chancellor of the exchequer ' s expectedly harsh tax burdens. // The great concern is that the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consumer , while not giving enough stimulus to private industry. // The government ' s own figure in the budget forecast unemployment rising to 3 million during 1982 and staying there until 1984 . National output this year is to fall 2 percent over last year . There is to be no balance-of-payments surplus at all in the first half of 1982. // The money supply will grow . Nationalized industries will need continued subsidies . Consumer spending is expected to fall because of the new taxes. // At least 1 out of every 5 cars on British roads is already owned and bought by companies , analysts say : and the figure could be as high as two-thirds . Prices are sky-high. // The economic editor of the centrist Times of London was so moved at the new dose of deflation that the headline on his post-budget article said simply : " Is there another tunnel at the end of the tunnel ?
