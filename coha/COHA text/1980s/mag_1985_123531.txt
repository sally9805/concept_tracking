Within the space of 16 minutes last Saturday , both ends of the Subway Series were derailed . The St. Louis Cardinals closed out the New York Mets in the NL East with a 7-1 victory over the Cubs , and the Toronto Blue Jays clinched the AL East title with a 5-1 win over the New York Yankees . // The Cards and Mets went at each other earlier in the week in a three-game series in St. Louis . The Mets trailed by three games coming in , but as Cardinal centerfielder Willie McGee said , " It was just like going up against a bear . He 's trying to corner you , and you 're trying your damndest to get out of the situation . " // The Mets won the first game 1-0 on Darryl Strawberry 's gigantic homer in the 11th . Pitchers Ron Darling and John Tudor provided the suspense  --  Darling went nine shutout innings and Tudor 10 . Some Mets called it the greatest game they ever played in , although they had less than kind words for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outpitched Joaquin Andujar to win the second game 5-2 for his 24th victory , despite a ninth-inning scare . " The coffin is open , and we are out , " said one Met. // New York was back in the old box after Thursday 's game . The Cards won 4-3 in typical fashion  --  all their runs came as the result of nine singles and aggressive running . Danny Cox went six strong innings before yielding to four members of the St. Louis Save Committee . // On Friday the two teams went about their separate tasks at home , and while the Mets beat the Expos 9-4 to cling to one last hope , the Cards clinched at least a tie with their 100th victory , 4-2 over Chicago . Tudor was back on the mound Saturday ; he pitched a four-hitter for his 21st win , and 20th in his last 21 decisions . The final out came at 4:44 p.m . E.S.T. , and afterward shortstop Ozzie Smith said , " What was irritating all year was hearing that the Mets were a better club than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Back in New York , the Mets were losing 8-3 to the Expos but receiving grateful ovations from their fans . // At 4:28 E.S.T. the long overdue Blue Jays finally did it . Toronto seemingly had the title wrapped up Friday night , what with a 3-2 lead with two out and none on in the ninth . But Tom Henke threw a fat fastball to Butch Wynegar , who had n't homered since June 7 , and Wynegar hit a shot over the rightfield wall . The roof then fell in as 1 ) Bobby Meacham singled off the glove of second baseman Damaso Garcia , 2 ) Rickey Henderson walked and 3 ) Don Mattingly hit a routine fly ball to right center that Lloyd Moseby simply dropped . The error gave the Yanks a 4-3 victory . // But Moseby was a hero the next day , hitting one of the Blue Jays ' three homers . The first was hit by catcher Ernie Whitt , an original member of the Jays , who said later , " All season people kept thinking that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back and winning today . " Ex-Yankee Doyle Alexander tied up the New York hitters , allowing only five hits and retiring 14 of the last 15 men he faced . His performance was even more remarkable because a stiff wind was blowing out to rightfield , favoring the Yankees ' left-handed hitters. // After the game , Toronto 's Cliff Johnson came into Yankee manager Billy Martin 's office with a bottle and told him , " I wanted to give you champagne because you gave me my start drinking it . " Johnson was referring , of course , to his 1977 season with the Yankees . // Martin allowed as how he was proud of the Yankees for fighting back , but , he said , " There 's no satisfaction in finishing second . Second place is for the birds . " // Actually , first place was for the birds , the Cardinals and Blue Jays .
