It 's time to lay off Hord Hardin , golf fans . No more jokes about the hopelessly stiff Augusta National chairman being a 19-handicap interviewer during the Masters ' green-jacket ceremony . No more groans about Hardin hogging the camera at the top of every Masters show to let us know how few commercials we 'll be seeing . And if Hardin wants to ask next year 's winner how much he weighs and how tall he is , the way he did Seve Ballesteros in 1980 , why he can go right ahead . All is forgiven , Hord . You 're our boy because , in effect , you tell CBS how to cover your golf tournament , not the other way around . // This proper relationship is unique in TV sports , but it made for two superb broadcasts last weekend . CBS does n't want to lose the Masters to ABC or NBC , so it shoots the tournament the way the Masters people want it shot  --  which is to say without gimmickry , hyperbole , loud voices or promos for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just golf  --  beautifully uncluttered shots of the greens of spring and stretches of what the late Henry Longhurst , for years a Masters commentator for CBS , once called " brilliant flashes of silence . " These were telecasts with announcing imperfections  --  " Crenshaw may not have a major championship , " Pat Summerall said at one point , " but as a human being he is one already "  --  that were soon forgotten . And they were easily forgotten because the Masters again proved itself a human event that happened to be shown by television , not a TV event that happened to be shown to humans . // The venerable Hardin , whose interviews of amateur Richard Fehr and Crenshaw this go-round were mercifully brief and fairly enlightening , deserves a pat on the back for keeping CBS 's coverage restrained . It 's Hardin , who since 1979 has maintained the Masters ' policy of one-year contracts with CBS at the relatively piddling sum , for a major event , of about $750,000 . This means CBS executive producer and director Frank Chirkinian , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event the way he 's supposed to or risk seeing the tournament on another network the following spring . In fact , with Chirkinian having produced the Masters for 26 years now , the Masters ' way has become his way . // Hardin 's predecessor as Augusta National chairman , the late Cliff Roberts , literally told CBS what to say ; he once banished announcer Jack Whitaker from the booth for five years when Whitaker referred to a stampeding gallery on the 18th fairway as a " mob . " Hardin exercises control more subtly , but last weekend CBS nonetheless obeyed the unwritten list of don'ts : Do n't talk about money  --  it 's too crass . Do n't run network promos , even if 60 Minutes is next . Do n't harp on terrible golf shots . Do n't chitchat with players on the course . Do n't estimate the size of the gallery . Do n't say trap , say bunker . Do n't say pin , say flag-stick . Remember , the event is calling the shots , not TV , even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observance of the Do n't List often produces delightful understatements . David Graham hit a timid putt last Saturday that hardly would have reached the windmill hazard on a miniature golf hole . Said the obligatory Englishman-in-the-booth , Ben Wright , " That is not his most distinguished effort . " Then there are some hilarious obfuscations made necessary by the announcers ' compliance with yet another commandment : Thou shalt honor the beauty of Augusta National . When Frank Glieber suggested that Saturday 's rain had made the course easier , Ken Venturi rushed to the rescue . " The rain , " he corrected , " has made this course absolutely beautiful . " // Aside from his one peccadillo , this may have been Venturi 's finest Masters as CBS 's resident analyst . His comments about the emotional equilibrium that first Mark Lye and then Crenshaw needed to maintain were fitting and satisfying . Summerall 's line as the likable Crenshaw stood victoriously on the 18th green  --  " I 've been here since 1968 and I cry every time "  --  was human and tender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hord , devise a rule requiring Weiskopf to stay in broadcasting . // During the Roberts era , the Masters used to send Chirkinian critique sheets . Here 's ours : 1 ) Evidently subscribing to the theory that American announcers do n't lend enough social class to prestige events , CBS used not one Brit in the booth but two . Clive Clark joined Wright , contributing little more than his accent . 2 ) Chirkinian still has the maddening habit of showing golf shot/golf shot/golf shot by the likes of Tommy Nakajima and Payne Stewart on the back nine , say , when he could be showing the leader on the front nine . We did n't see Lye , the 36-hole leader , until 55 minutes into Saturday 's telecast. // But this was the Masters ' way as much as it was Chirkinian 's . So here 's to you , Hord . Your green-jacket gig is cornball , but it 's not too much to bear .                   @ @
