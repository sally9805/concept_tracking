Mike Royko is on vacation . While he is gone , we are Table reprinting some of his favorite columns from the past . The following originally appeared in print on Nov. 8 , 1973 . <> A recent magazine survey shows that the average American male worries more about the size of his belly than any other part of his body . That probably surprises people who think that the sexual revolution would have provoked concern about other physical attributes , but the magazine Psychology Today says it ain ' t so . The survey shows that the stay-young-and-lean syndrome has changed the attitude toward a pot belly , which was once considered a fine thing for a young man to have . If the survey had been taken 35 years ago , they would have found pride , if anything , in a bulging middle . Of course , such a survey could not have been taken then . Any pollster who asked men to describe how they felt about parts of their own bodies would have been knocked down and beaten . The pot belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one . An alderman who didn ' t look well-fed would have been suspected of honesty , and therefore , of stupidity . It was the sign of maturity . A young man wasn ' t grown until he could belly up to the bar . And how could you belly up to the bar without a belly ? The finest athletes had them , especially bowlers , softball players , perch fishermen and furniture movers . So did all the civic leaders , such as the desk sergeant , the bookie and the tavern owner . The greatest stomach in our neighborhood belonged to Slats Grobnik ' s uncle , Beer-Belly Frank Grobnik . He claimed his stomach was the secret of his legendary strength and agility . He could lift a jukebox in his arms and dance with it , which he did every Saturday night in the tavern . " I ' d like to see some greasy tango dancer try it , " he ' d boast as he clumped around the saloon . He was proud of his talent ; so he was often offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Aragon Ballroom and they wouldn ' t let him in unless he checked his jukebox at the door . Like most men of great bellies , Frank used it to communicate emotions . When he finished a hearty meal of beer and hard-boiled eggs , he would thump it with his broad hand . Everybody knew Frank had just eaten by the deep sound that rolled through the neighborhood . He scratched it when he was tired and rubbed it when he was hungry . And when he was angry , he would thrust it forward and use it as a weapon . Those who felt the wrath of his belly said it was like being struck by a fat truck . It was always Slats ' dream to have a belly like his Uncle Frank ' s . But nature didn ' t intend it . He was so skinny you could actually see through him in a bright light . At the beach , he once drank too much strawberry pop and looked like a tall thermometer . Nature decided that Slats physical distinction would be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his father took one look and then asked the nurse , " What do we feed it  --  birdseed ? " His aunt Wanda , who had knowledge of the occult , asked Mrs. Grobnik : " Think back . Before Slats was born , did anything frighten you , or give you a bad shock . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Grobnik . " My husband did . " As Slats grew up , he became sensitive about his nose . Anytime another kid so much as sneezed , Slats thought he was being made fun of and would start swinging . Goofy Archie , who had hay fever , spent his entire summers sneezing and ducking . Because of Slats ' sensitivity , people tried to persuade him that a prominent nose was a mark of distinction . " Abraham Lincoln had a long nose , " his mother told him . Slats nodded sadly . " Yeah , that ' s probably why they plugged him . " The candy store man told him , " What you got kid , is a Roman nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock through the candy store window . " Nobody can call me a Dago , " he said . A teacher , trying to be progressive and kind , finally thought she had the solution . She asked Slats to play the part of Cyrano in a school play . " Cyrano ' s nose was rather long , " she told Slats , " but he was very brave and honorable and smart . " " Sounds like me , all right , " said Slats , giving the teacher a pinch . The teacher ' s idea didn ' t work . Slats read the script until he reached the part where Cyrano hides under the beautiful Roxanne ' s balcony and whispers sweet love words for a handsome , but inarticulate , young man to repeat to her . That ' s when Slats flung down the script and walked out , saying , " I ain ' t playing the part of no pimp. "
