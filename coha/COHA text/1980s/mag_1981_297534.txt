The U.S. begins reshaping its Middle East policies <P> Ai the consequences of the assassination of Anwar Sadat began to permeate Washington last week , the Reagan Administration found itself scrambling to patch together answers , however temporary , to a host of delicate questions raised by the death of the Egyptian leader . How best to beef up the regime of Hosni Mubarak , Sadat 's successor ? How to keep the Libyans at bay in the Sudan ? Perhaps most important , how to speed up the Egyptian-Israeli talks on Palestinian autonomy ? At stake is not only the influence of the United States in a crucial part of the globe , but , ultimately , issues of peace or war in the Middle East . <P> It was hardly propitious , then , that the Administration 's plan to sell five Airborne Warning and Control System planes to Saudi Arabia was rebuffed in Congress twice last week . After four hours of debate , the House of Representatives rejected the AW ACS deal , as expected . But the wide margin of the defeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also voted against the sale , 9 to 8 . Though the Administration had expected to lose that vote as well , Reagan lobbied committee members by telephone right to the last minute , and supporters of the sale took heart that the vote was so close . Said Republican Majority Leader Howard Baker : " We have a good chance to win this thing . The momentum is going our way . " <P> The AW ACS deal can be blocked only if both chambers reject it . So the Administration is pushing hard for approval from the full Senate , which is now scheduled to vote on the matter next week . Some of the White House lobbying has been less than subtle : in a swap for their votes , Democrat Dennis DeConcini of Arizona was informed that Reagan would not campaign against him next year , while Republican Charles Grassley of Iowa was told that his choice for U.S. Attorney back home would be quickly nominated . A more promising tactic to woo votes is the Administration 's proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuring members that certain conditions for the deal ( U.S. access to the data collected by the AW ACS , for example ) will be met . <P> While continuing to fight for the Saudi deal on Capitol Hill , the Administration also moved rapidly to send a strong signal of support to both Egypt and its beleaguered neighbor , the Sudan , which is threatened by the presence of 7,000 Libyan troops in nearby Chad . After conferring in Cairo with Mubarak and Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiri following Sadat 's funeral , Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the U.S. would speed up the delivery of arms already promised to Egypt and the Sudan . In addition , Washington last week dispatched two AW ACS planes from the U.S. to Egypt both to symbolize U.S. commitment and to improve that country 's air surveillance of Libya . Finally , officials in Washington and Cairo were still working out details of a monthlong joint military training exercise , code-named " Bright Star , " scheduled to begin next month in Egypt . Some 4,000 U.S. troops will take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The Sudan will join the exercise , and Washington is trying to persuade Oman and Somalia to participate too . <P>
