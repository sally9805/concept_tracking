Even as they sip their victory toasts , many Wall Street professionals predict that the Dow Jones Industrial Average won ' t stay above 2000 long . " A victory celebration and then a headache " is the prognosis of Alfred Goldman , the director of technical analysis for A.G. Edwards Inc. , a St. Louis securities firm . Many others agree , though there are still some bulls around . Here is a sampling of expert opinion about whither the Dow : Forward , Then Backward Mr. Goldman says the Dow will continue forward to 2050 or 2100 and then lurch into reverse , dropping to around 1800 . For several reasons , he says , " the market isn ' t ready to make a major move forward . " Among them are uncertainties regarding economic growth , corporate earnings , interest rates , and " the whodunit in Washington " concerning the Iran arms controversy . Groundhog Day Robert Stovall , the president and chief investment officer of Stovall Twenty-First Advisers , a New York money-management firm , says the average " will provide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dow will " poke its head over the 2000 level , see its shadow and promptly duck down again . " For the year , Mr. Stovall predicts a top of about 2200 and a bottom of about 1650 . Given his expectation of modest economic growth , a possible increase in inflation and no significant decline in interest rates , he figures there ' s " more risk than reward " in the market for the next several months . A Bad Sign Monte Gordon , the director of research for Dreyfus Corp. , the New York administrator of a family of mutual funds , says the market ' s cutting through the 2000 barrier " like a hot knife through butter " is actually a bad sign . He figures that a burst through the barrier is likely to be followed by a contraction , say to 1850 or 1875 . Impressed by the Tape Martin Zweig , the editor of the Zweig Forecast , a New York newsletter , is optimistic in the short run . " The tape has turned , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " Mr. Zweig points out that days in which up volume runs ahead of down volume 9 to 1 or better  --  as it did on Friday and Monday  --  are rarities . Two such days within a three-month stretch have led , on average , to further gains of 14% over the following six months , he notes . But Mr. Zweig expects the rally to fizzle after the Dow hits 2100 or so . " Every rally has an end , " he says . " My gut says this rally ' s going to be not of the longest duration . " Lot of Risk Even more apprehensive is Lucinda Mezey , the director of equity research for Provident National Bank in Philadelphia . " I guess it could get up to 2100 , but I think there is a lot of risk at that level and substantial risk even at the current level , " she says . Current stock prices , Ms. Mezey figures , are " generous " compared with book values , cash flows , earnings or dividends . She believes analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of Congress ' s commitment to dealing with the budget deficit . Moreover , the " locomotives that moved the market in 1986 " are unlikely to repeat their performance in 1987 , Ms. Mezey says . Those driving forces included a " precipitous decline in interest rates , " a major fall in the dollar against major foreign currencies , a dramatic drop in oil prices , a decline in inflation and improved quality for reported corporate earnings . Therefore , she says she wouldn ' t be surprised to see a 15% drop in the major market averages . Ms. Mezey also notes that the Dow has outperformed other market indicators because " people are still flocking towards quality . " Thus , the market as a whole is not doing quite so well as the new Dow record might indicate . A Year of Fluctuation Mary Farrell , a vice president and market analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins , a New York securities firm , says interest rates aren ' t likely to fall much , if at all . She says the outlook for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her colleagues at Paine Webber predict that the Dow will fluctuate within a trading range of about 1800 to 2200 for the year . Further Gains Elaine Garzarelli , a market strategist for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. , a New York securities firm , says the Dow " could go up another 15% to 20% before it would be overvalued . " Ms. Garzarelli sees 15% growth in corporate profits in 1987 and expects the Dow to hit 2300 or 2400 before the year ends . Ms. Garzarelli sees only three factors that could derail that forecast . One would be the Federal Reserve Board tightening credit . A second would be a recession , and a third would be a significant rise in interest rates . Ms. Garzarelli doesn ' t expect any of those things to happen . For the Fed to tighten credit , she says , " they ' d have to be fools . " Cautious Optimist Also optimistic , though with caution , is Yale Hirsch , the publisher of Smart Money newsletter and the annual Stock Trader ' s Almanac . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money out there is so fantastic that it ' s more likely we will keep going . " How far ? As Mr. Hirsch sees it , the Dow will rise to anywhere between 2300 and 2700 , depending on the effects of the unfolding Iran arms controversy . Backward , Then Forward Hildegard Zagorski , a market strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . , New York , says a spate of profit taking may ensue . But if it does , she expects it to be brief . " Some people say , ' When the Dow gets to 2000 I ' m going to sell , ' " she notes . Ms. Zagorski says that after a dip to 1970 or 1980 , additional buyers will step in and might well push the Dow to 2200 or higher between February and April . Secondary Optimism " I ' m bullish , " proclaims Michael Reid , the editor of Insider Indicator , a Portland , Ore. , newsletter . His main reason for optimism : " strength in the secondary issues . " For the stocks in the Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part on an increase in stock purchases by foreigners , especially the Japanese . But he says  --  mainly on the basis of buying patterns by corporate officers , directors and major stockholders  --  that the bigger gains ahead will be in the smaller stocks . " It ' s going to be a choppy market , " Mr. Reid adds . " It ' s not going to be a dull one , folks. "  --  - Table Biggest One-Day Gains DATE CLOSE GAIN %CHG .
