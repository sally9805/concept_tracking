Some of the nation ' s largest bank holding companies reported record earnings for the second quarter yesterday , largely thanks to loans made at unprecendently high interest rates when the cost of money to the banks was dropping sharply . Bankers and bank analysts said the conditions leading to the record earnings were unusual and repeat performances this year are unlikely . J.P . Morgan &; Co. , holding company for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , the nation ' s fifth-largest commerical bank , reported its earnings increased a record 45 percent from the second quarter of last year and topped earnings for any quarter in the company ' s history . Second- quarter income at Morgan was $101.5 million , compared with $69.8 million during the second quarter of 1979 . New England ' s largest bank holding company , First National Boston Corp . ( FNBC ) , parent company of the First National Bank of Boston , reported record quarterly earnings of $26.7 million , or $2.15 per share before securities transactions , compared with $20.8 million , or $1.69 per share , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per share , compared with $21.3 million , or $1.74 per share , a year ago . Chemical New York Corp. , holding company of Chemical Bank , the nation ' s sixth-largest commerical bank , reported that earnings rose 25.6 percent above the second quarter of 1979 .

Shawmut Corp. , holding company for the Shawmut Bank of Boston , reported earnings before securities transactions of $4.45 millionm , or $2.38 per share , compared with $4 million , or $2.16 per share last year . Alan Mckinnon , chief financial officer for the FNBC , said the " spread that opened up between the cost of short-term funds and the base ( lending ) rate " was a key to the company ' s performance during the second quarter . At the beginning of the quarter banks were paying more than 16 percent interest for funds . But interest rates moved down gradually through most of the remainder of the quarter and at the end of the period were below 10 percent . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 20 percent . In the traditional pattern , loan interest rates came down more slowly than the cost of funds to the banks . Increase in loan and lease demand , along with profits taken in bond trading help boost profits for the quarter , McKinnon said . For example , in the second quarter of last year , the corporation lost $81,000 in bond trading while this year there was a $4.2-million gain . McKinnon said high-technology firms in New England were largely responsible for keeping loan demand stong during the beginning of the recession . International lending was also up during the quarter . Lawrence Fuller , a bank analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York , said that throughout the country , and particularly in the West , banks that emphasize retail services for consumers had weaker second-quarter performances than the banks with large corporate business . Consumer loan demand slowed much more than corporate loan demand , he said . Fuller noted that many corporations took loans when rates were high to test if credit was available , bringing substantial profits to banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates " is not likely be as strong during the rest of the year , " Fuller predicted . That change should lead to smaller earnings for banks , he said .
