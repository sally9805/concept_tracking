When the U.S. team arrives in Moscow this week , the main item on its agenda will be President Reagan 's letter of July 25 to Mikhail Gorbachev . The secret missive contains a proposal for a transition to a world in which both superpowers could have large-scale strategic defenses . Under the President 's timetable , the deployment of such Star Wars systems would not occur for at least 7 1/2 years . That feature was promptly leaked and widely seen as a victory for Secretary of State George Shultz and other arms-control advocates : it opened the way to " delay " deployment of SDI as part of a grand compromise that would include deep cuts in offensive weapons . <P> Actually , the letter represented something of a victory for Pentagon hard- liners opposed to any concession on SDI . For one thing , SDI would not really be delayed , since there is no way the program would be ready for deployment in less than 7 1/2 years . Even more important , the letter contains a new wrinkle in an old debate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty , which restricts the development , testing and deployment of missile defense systems . <P> Last year hard-liners like Richard Perle asserted that SDI was exempt from the treaty 's constraints on development and testing because it is based on exotic technologies unavailable in 1972 . This Philadelphia-lawyerly reading was hotly disputed , not only by the Soviets but by the American negotiators who helped draft the treaty as well . It would in effect render the ABM treaty meaningless and open the way to a defensive arms race in space . That is just what the Pentagon wants and what the Soviets are determined to prevent . After &; months of wrangling , Shultz persuaded Reagan to adopt a cumbersome compromise : the U.S. would claim that the Pentagon 's " permissive " interpretation of the ABM treaty was correct but that it would nonetheless abide by the more " restrictive " reading that prohibits anything more than research on SDI . Uneasy with the Administration 's position , Congress has demanded access to the secret negotiating record . <P> This esoteric but critical issue erupted again during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to reiterate the restrictive interpretation , the Pentagon was pushing its permissive one . The Pentagon won . Reagan wrote to Gorbachev that during the 7 1/2 years before deployment is allowed , the U.S. reserves the right to proceed with the research , development and testing of SDI , " which is permitted " by the ABM treaty . Earlier this year Reagan touched off a storm of protest by declaring , at the Pentagon 's behest , that the U.S. would no longer be bound by the unratified SALT II limits on offensive weapons . Now he has called into question how much longer the U.S. will feel bound by the ABM treaty .
