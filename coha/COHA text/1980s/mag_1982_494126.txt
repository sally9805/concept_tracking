THE DEMOCRATS AFTER TED BY MORTON KONDRACKE DOES IT SEEM awfully early for people to be running for President , or , as Edward Kennedy did the other day , deciding not to run ? It may seem that way , but it is n't . George McGovern announced his 1972 candidacy on January .. 18 , 1971 . Jimmy Carter formally entered the 1976 race on December 12 , 1974 . And Philip Crane , for all the good it did him , announced his candidacy for the 1980 Republican nomination on August 2 , 1978 . It is true , though , that the 1984 Democratic candidates are much further along in their planning and organizing than Presidential contenders have been in previous years . Senator Gary Hart has hired Bill Romjue , President Carter 's Iowa campaign director in 1976 and 1980 , to begin organizing for Iowa 's party caucuses , which will occur on February 27 , 1984 . Senator John Glenn has signed a lease for 5,000 square feet of office space in a building at 444 North Capitol Street in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office building on Wisconsin Avenue above Georgetown , is deciding who will fit where in his campaign organization , and is expected to announce his candidacy formally during the first three months of next year . According to aides to Hart , Kennedy , and Mondale , the candidates this year are six to eight months ahead of the planning schedules of past election years , and they all agree about why this is so . Federal election laws state that as of January 1 , 1983 , money raised for a Presidential campaign or exploratory committee will be matched by public funds . To be out of the gate and ready to begin fundraising at maximum speed at the start of next year , candidates have to get ready this year . Part of getting ready is looking for and signing up the best political and fundraising talent available , finding supporters in the primary states , gathering intelligence about local issues , and scouting the opposition . In each election cycle , this process gets started earlier than in the one before . Now that Kennedy is out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about just how extensively organ-ized his campaign was . What they say provides a gauge with which to judge how far things have moved in other campaigns , where offi-cials are understand-ably reluctant to reveal too much . What Kenne-dy 's aides say reinforces his claim that it was " family considerations " ? not political ones-that'caused him to withdraw . Someone might have ended up beating Kennedy , but at the time he decided not to run , there was every reason for him to think he could win . Polls in New Hampshire indicated that television advertising could suppress the " character issue " in primary states , and although top party professionals ( reportedly including Massachusetts 's own Tip O'Neill ) feared that Kennedy could n't win a general election battle against President Reagan or some other Republican , he would have started the race with a long lead among Democrats . The last national poll on the subject , a Gallup poll in August , showed Kennedy with 43 percent support , Mondale with 13 percent , Glenn with 7 percent , and others with less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy was planning to start early and hit hard to hold his lead . The Kennedy strategy was to try for an early knockout in the first caucuses and primaries . In Iowa he had convinced former senator and governor Harold Hughes to switch his support from Senator Alan Cranston and to become one of his national co-chairmen . Kennedy was scheduled to make an unannounced trip to Iowa next spring , and to travel around by car with Hughes , talking to potential supporters for two days , before the national press realized what was happening and descended on the state . Kennedy was then to head back to Washington , and once the press had left Iowa , return for another tour with Hughes . Although Kennedy took a drubbing in Iowa in 1980 , he had a solid base of 35,000 out of the 100,000 or so persons who show up for caucuses-35,000 who stood with Kennedy even though Carter was charging that support for Kennedy would be interpreted in Iran as undermining American resolve . K ENNEDY 'S POSITION was strong in New Hampshire , whose primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discounted , as it would in Massachusetts the following week . But the Kennedy camp hoped to startle the press and the party with unexpected showings in a group of Southern primaries on March 13 . Private polls reportedly showed Kennedy leading in Florida , especially among Jews , Hispanics , and blacks in south Florida . Kennedy strategists also thought they had a chance at winning the Alabama primary . As reported by Tom Oliphant in the December 5 Boston Globe , Kennedy strategists were planning an effort to win an endorsement from George Wallace . They had hopes for a surprise showing in South Carolina , too , because its Democratic national committeeman , Don Fowler , was to be another national co-chairman . Most of all , though , Kennedy was counting on the votes of blacks , who were shown in polls as favoring Kennedy by margins of 8 and 9 to 1 . Kennedy was clobbered by Carter in the 1980 Illinois primary , but his strategists had hopes of winning in 1984 because state chairman Phil Rock had indicated willingness to switch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primaries and caucuses , and to raise money , Kennedy and his aides had planned to form an exploratory committee in early January . A suite of former Amtrak offices at 440 North Capitol Street had been selected , and some aides think it was the prospect of signing a lease for the offices that forced the timing of Kennedy 's decision . The campaign was to have been headed on a day-to-day basis by Dr. Larry Horowitz , chief of his Senate staff . New York lawyer Jack English was to be Kennedy 's traveling campaign adviser or a key political strategist . Accused in 1980 of sexism ( he had no women in top positions on his staff ) , Kennedy had hired Ranny Cooper , former head of the 1A/omen 's Campaign Fund , to be a deputy campaign manager . Mark Siegel , former executive director of the Democratic National Committee , was to have been another deputy , handling politics . Bill Carrick , a South Carolinian , would have been in charge of field operations . The Kennedyites also had planned to strike fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported by Oliphant , there were indications that Kennedy wanted to enlist Representative Morris Udall to be a key campaign spokesman , and there were discussions about Kennedy 's doing a return interview with Roger Mudd , now of NBC , whose famous CBS interview had contributed to Kennedy 's 1980 defeat . Financially , Kennedy 's plan called for raising $18.5 million during 1983 , so that it would not he necessary to depend ? as many 1980 candidates did ? on one Tuesday 's primary election performance to fund the next week 's primary campaign . The plan was so detailed that monthly fundraising goals had been set for the next eighteen months , and individuals had been assigned responsibility for holding specific fundraising events around the country . Even though he is out as a 1984 candidate , Kennedy undoubtedly will be a major power in the Democratic Party . He can influence who gets the nomination if he chooses ( or chooses not ) to tell his liberal , black , Hispanic , and labor followers whom he favors . No one in the party will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic , romantic shadow figure to the Democratic rank and file . Undoubtedly he will have a chance to bring down the house again at the 1984 Democratic Convention , and if Reagan runs and wins again , Kennedy will be back as the front-runner for 1988 , when no incumbent will be seeking reelection . Kennedy has hinted to some of his aides that he is seriously thinking about 1988 , and his new membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee will provide him with foreign policy and defense credentials that he now lacks . S OME COMMENTATORS , including William Safire , have suggested that there 's also a chance that Kennedy might be drafted at the 1984 convention if the economy is in such bad shape that the country is demanding a clear-cut liberal , and if the convention is hopelessly deadlocked . But this eventuality is very remote . " There 's no such thing as a real draft , " says Mark Siegel . " Such things have to be planned . Furthermore , the system is not designed to produce deadlocks , but a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a clear nominee at least by the first Tuesday in June . We have n't had two ballots at a national convention in either party since 1952 , and we wo n't have one in 1984 . " What does Kennedy 's withdrawal do for and to the other candidates ? In one sense , it means everything to them ; in another sense , it means nothing . All Kennedy 's opponents obviously are helped when the front-runner quits . His superb staff , key supporters , potential contributors , and constituencies are up for grabs . Who benefits most is debatable . The freeing-up of first-rate political professionals probably aids Glenn more than the others , since of the major campaigns his is the least organized and the most in need of major talent . Glenn has been relying for political advice on a pair of Washington business lobbyists , Robert Keefe and Tommy Boggs , who have limited connections in the various constituencies of the Democratic Party . Glenn probably will vie with Mondale for the endorsement of the AFL-CIO , but Mondale is more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hard for labor to decide between them . Kennedy 's liberal constituency might gravitate to Hart , who was McGovern 's 1972 campaign manager , or to California Senator Alan Cranston , who is making the nuclear freeze a centerpiece of his campaign , but that assumes that no new candidates , such as Udall or Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers , enter the field . The groups most adrift are blacks and Hispanics . Also free ? but one would scarcely say adrift ? are money-raisers and givers . One Glenn strategist said that on the day after Kennedy 's withdrawal , he assigned a worker to look over Kennedy 's federal campaign reports to compile lists of names . Other campaigns presumably are doing the same . But after Kennedy 's withdrawal , as before , the inherent weaknesses and strengths of the various candidates remain what they were , and the quest for the nomination remains , as one key Mondale aide put it , " a twenty-month , $26 million effort requiring an enormous campaign organization that can sustain itself whatever ups and downs occur . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best organized of any of the campaigns , possibly including Kennedy 's . Mondale aides do not dispute that , much as Mondale does not dispute the notion that Kennedy 's departure leaves him the frontrunner . The aides contend that Mondale has the largest group of identified workers around the country , the largest and most sophisticated " extended family " ? including former Carter Administration aides and the largest cadre of political professionals now working in Mondale 's political action committee , in his exploratory committee , or as volunteer advisers . M ONDALE 'S STATUS as front-runner will be tested within days , as the first public opinion polls suggest where Kennedy supporters have gone . His lead over Glenn was not all that great before Kennedy 's withdrawal ( six points ) , and may not be all that great afterward . Far more important than the polls , though , is the inherent strength of a candidacy ? that is , the ability to avoid mistakes , gauge opponents , set agendas , define issues , and appeal for popular support . One of Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide to Gary Hart , has described four styles of recent Presidential candidacy : " surfing , " " strategic , " " traditional , " and " positional . " Smith is reluctant to apply the labels to 1984 candidacies , but his description makes it easy for anyone else to do so . " Surfing " means " pointing your surfboard toward the shore , not trying to power your way through and hoping that you 'll make it while the waves knock everyone else over . " Carter was a surfer in 1976 . This year 's surfers might include Alan Cranston , Ernest Hollings , and Reubin Askew , plus anyone who decides to leap into the race at this late date . " Strategic " campaigning consists of having a definite idea about the times , being first to set the terms of debate , and targeting opponents ' points of weakness . All the candidates will be a mix of the types , but Gary Hart is trying to be the best strategist by defining a new agenda that bypasses that of older Democratic leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sheer weight of the Presidential incumbency , and Kennedy 's 1984 campaign , too , showed strategic sparks . " Traditional " campaigning , in Larry Smith 's formulation , consists of " running for President like you run for county sheriff : assembling an organization , collecting people , issuing statements , stimulating name recognition , responding to issues defined by others . It 's adhocery. - That sounds much like Mondale 's long-march approach to the 1984 campaign , but the Mondale family also contains a number of shrewd strategists , some of the same people who trounced Kennedy in 1980 . Finally , " positional " politics consists simply of being somebody or something and letting the electorate come calling . Eisenhower in 1952 was a war hero with nearly universal name recognition and public respect , though with rather undefined politics . Glenn is much the same in 1984 , though he does appear to be following a strategy ? that of being a centrist and appealing to the South and Midwest . HICHEVER of Smith 's categories they fit , Kenne- dy 's 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will say ? and some of them actually will mean ? that Kennedy 's action was a courageous act of self-denial , of placing dedication to family ahead of political ambition . Some will also argue that it was good for the Democratic Party , removing the Kennedy shadow from the nominating process and giving other ( perhaps more electable ) candidates a chance to lead . All of that is true enough , but it is true for this election cycle only . If Kennedy had run this time and lost ? either to another Democrat or to a Republican ? then he would have had his two chances and would have had to retire from Presidential politics . The country and the Democratic Party could have laid their Kennedy fixation to rest . But by withdrawing , he has kept himself a potential President for the future , so the party and country can not get over its preoccupation with him , and newer candidates ? Bill Bradleys , Mario Cuomos , Bruce Rabbits , Jim Hunts ? ca n't really come to the fore . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : Kennedy 's withdrawal just may have been the beginning of Campaign ' 88.
