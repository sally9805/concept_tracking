The current flood of books and articles about warfare and society reflects a growing scholarly conviction that war is too im-portant to be left to military historians . Few would want to echo Churchill 's assertion that " the story of the human race is War , " but the liberal nineteenth-century view that wars were regrettable interruptions of normal peaceful development seems , if anything , even more distorted . New research is piling up on the sociology of armies , the relationship between the state and the military , the demographic and other complex social consequences of war , including its impact upon women , the family and the framing of social policy . What was once regarded as almost a separate discipline narrowly preoccupied with strategy , generals , military institutions and weaponry , has been stretched and reshaped beyond recognition . These assaults upon traditional military history have not come exclusively from outside . Insiders have played a conspicuous role , and none more than John Keegan , formerly a teacher at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and now defense correspondent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , The Face of Battle and Six Armies in Normandy , made clear the general configuration of his interests . He explores the reality of war as experienced by those who particiGeoffrey Field teaches European history at SUNY , Purchase . He is at work on a book about Britain in World War II . ? pate in it . Large themes such as technological change , the social and economic sinews of war and the ways in which a nation 's military reproduces its values and traditions are woven into first-rate analysis of the immediate and practical problems of fighting and command . The result is a fascinating and intensely human picture of war as a cultural activity , a picture that is rigorously contextualized but invites wider speculation about the place of warfare in human history . Keegan 's new book is about command and styles of heroic leadership , a conventional enough subject , but not in the incisive way he approaches it . Through four case studies  --  of Alexander the Great , the Duke of Wellington , Ulysses S. Grant and Adolf Hitler  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Western history . His chosen framework  --  four variations on the theme of heroism  --  at times seems too narrow and schematic , but numerous historical comparisons widen the study 's focus and make it much more than a loosely linked quartet of commanders . Nor is Keegan 's interest confined to the past : indeed , the full implications of his treatment of heroism only become apparent at the end in a discussion of the leadership style appropriate to a nuclear world . The " mask of command " is the countenance a leader shows to his followers , those external attributes conducive to power over them , presented in a way that reflects their needs . In the case of Alexander the Great , it is the only image we have , for we know little of his inner life and ideas . His extraordinary career , in which he mastered the Greek world , conquered the Persian empire and projected his power as far as India , left a model of heroic leadership for ambitious men across the centuries . It was a highly theatrical style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-association with the gods set him apart , while his meticulous provisioning and close knowledge of and concern for his soldiers made him one of them . On the battlefield he sought victory by risk-taking and self-exposure . Attacking an enemy at his strongest point , always in front himself , this Homeric-type hero was totally absorbed in the thick of the fighting . Alexandrian heroism found innumerable imitators throughout the history of warfare , but increasingly , argues Keegan , a second theory of generalship predominated . Growth in the size and complexity of armies , intensification of drill and increasing use of reserve formations made it imperative for generals to position themselves close enough to see and know what was happening but suitably distant to be able to direct the battle as a whole . Just two centuries after Alexander , Philo of Byzantium asserted that a general must prescribe and direct the heroism of others : " It is your duty not to take part in the battle , for whatever you may accomplish by spilling your own blood could not compare with the harm you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " The next two case studies examine the evolution of this new style in the nineteenth century . Keegan 's admiration for Wellington is evident throughout , and his analysis of the Iron Duke 's command at Waterloo is a fine companion piece to his earlier descriptions of the fighting in The Face of Battle . We gain an excellent picture of Wellington 's tireless movement from one section of the battlefield to the next , in close range of the fighting , personally directing the action , using the topography to screen his troops , scrutinizing enemy movements in search of an advantage and moving decisively when an opportunity arose . Aloof , supervisory , known to his soldiers as " the long-nosed bastard that beats the French , " Wellington was , in Keegan 's words , " perhaps the most perfect embodiment of the gentlemanly ideal England has ever produced " : disciplined , modest , self-assured , reticent . Wearing civilian clothes , he avoided all self-dramatization and scorned Napoleon 's histrionics . His was a deliberately antiheroic style : efficient , unemotional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally hierarchical , where the best  --  by breeding and trainingmust rule with a firm hand . If Wellington 's style suited aristocratic Georgian England , Grant 's reflected both the mood of American democracy and the vast technological changes that transformed war in the next half-century . By the 1860s the growing density and accuracy of rifle and artillery fire created wider and more lethal " killing zones " than were previously imaginable . Railroads and the telegraph had also revolutionized logistics and communications . Keegan examines Grant , supreme commander of the Union armies , as an exemplar of the new professionalism . Trained at West Point , grasping fully the significance of river , rail and cable links , he was exceptionally good at anticipating the intentions of his opponents and ruthless in carrying the war into the heart of the Confederacy . In battle Grant remained close to the action , rallying dispirited regiments at Shiloh  --  the battle Keegan examines in detail  --  and gathering knowledge of conditions at first hand , but always keeping himself as protected as possible . He was neither in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of complete " forward control " ( one thinks of Guderian , Rommel and Montgomery in World War II ) . Yet this consciously unheroic professional with his plain , simple style and horror of display ( a stark contrast to the grandeur of Lee ) captured the popular imagination ; he seemed an expression of the Republic 's populism with his firm sense of the subordination of the military to civilian government and his recognition that the volunteer and largely untrained troops of a people 's army must be " led , not driven to battle . " Moltke and the European professionals may have disparaged the Civil War as " an affair of armed mobs , " but it can well claim the title of " the first modern war " ? in its industrial underpinning , the direct engagement of entire populations and the fact that it became a " total " conflict . Surprisingly , Keegan does not explore the disregard of Europeans for the lessons this conflict afforded . He also says little about the strategic devastations carried out by Grant and Sherman ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war ) , or their willingness to sacrifice large numbers of men to achieve their ends . Keegan 's final exemplar of command is Hitler , who , like Alexander , combined in one personality supreme political and ? Jmilitary power . We are all familiar with the planning inconsistencies that marred the invasion of Soviet Russia , with the Fiihrer 's preference for yes-men and the replacement of all but the most sycophantic of advisers . Numerous accounts have also detailed his stubborn refusal to contemplate the real circumstances of his armies in the East , which prevented any withdrawal and trapped the Sixth Army in the ruins of Stalingrad . Can there be anything new to add ? Astonishingly enough , Keegan offers a fresh and original perspective on Hitler 's strengths and deficiencies as a military leader , largely by close reference to his war experiences on the Western Front . The figure that emerges from this analysis is more soldier and front-fighter than politician . For Hitler politics was war or at least the preparation for war and his unswerving goal was to realize the victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloodiest battles on the Western Front , three times wounded and decorated with the Iron Cross for his bravery , Hitler 's identification with the war generation was complete . It permeated his personality , politics and generalship . The relentless stalemate of trench warfare sharpened his appreciation of new methods of warfare and new technology , especially the tank , the chief instrument of his bold strategies in Poland and France . But his own service having been exclusively in the West , he had no sense of the vast distances and immense climatic obstacles to campaigning in the East . He also adhered to the World War I doctrine that an army that has ceased to advance is best protected by holding its line . Already in World War I the immense scale of battles and the ferocity of the bombardment had produced a " Chateau generalship , " with the fighting being directed from fifty miles back . Hitler himself had served in the highly exposed position of messenger or battalion runner , preserving communication with the most forward troops . He preferred to run his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as a thousand miles from the action . Distance was typical of Eisenhower 's command , too , but he never attempted the same concentration of all operations and decisions . Confident of his ability to maintain direct control via newly developed wireless technology and not recognizing the deficiencies of such information , Hitler overrode the advice of subordinate commanders onthe scene . Stubborn will epitomized his larger strategy ; pedantic meddling with details increasingly substituted for professional tactics . This , Keegan argues , was superficial generalship , haphazard , amateurish . It was also " false heroic , " chiefly because it sought to eliminate the distance between commander and combat troops by a propaganda blitz that portrayed Hitler as a suffering hero , whose personal experience of war and whose present ordeal of command allowed him to internalize and share the hardships of his soldiers . Each of these four case studies forms a separate entity of its own . Combined , they evince a general theme about the reshaping of heroic leadership in response to social and military change . This has contemporary significance as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear age . His comments are too brief , more tantalizing than substantive . He notes that the inevitable secrecy surrounding nuclear command procedures conflicts with democratic openness , but does little to explore the consequences . He also goes on to defend S.D.I. as a continuation of the underrated tradition of military fortification and as an " enormously hope-giving initiative . " Keegan views it not as the impregnable protective astrodome of Reagan 's dreams , but as a means of slowing the ever-increasing velocities of likely nuclear crises . Star Wars becomes a way of procuring more time for rational conduct in a crisis . Regrettably , Keegan takes no account of contrary arguments . Star Wars technology may be publicized as purely defensive , but the distinction between defensive and offensive is murky indeed ( and there are plenty of historical parallels here ) . Soviet fears that the United States is aiming for first-strike capacity could well produce , if the current round of negotiations falters , new offensive countermeasures and the increasing militarization of space . Moreover , even a " leaky " shield means in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to make rational decisions under those nightmarish conditions . He also ignores the social and economic cost : the huge diversion of resources and the potentially destabilizing impact of these immense expenditures  --  all undertaken on the basis of technical and strategic assumptions that are highly questionable . Discussing the appropriate mode of leadership for today when ultimate command has shifted to civilian heads of state , and war means mutual destruction , Keegan calls for a " post-heroic " style , one that will inhibit , not instigate , conflict . We certainly need less posturing , less readiness to use foreign policy for domestic political ends , and more modesty , prudence and rational thinking to counter the computerized hair-trigger readiness of the technology . But I find Keegan 's recommended style too limited , too passive . Surely there is need for a different kind of heroism : the courage to pursue forthrightly and unambiguously a strategy of reducing and eliminating nuclear stockpiles .
