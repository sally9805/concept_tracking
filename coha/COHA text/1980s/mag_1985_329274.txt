" Rosty " the reformer ? No one who has watched Congressman Dan Rostenkowski cut a deal with a colleague or swing a golf club with a lobbyist has ever called him that . Indeed , as a former Chicago ward heeler and protege of the late Mayor Richard Daley , he seems to be the quintessential machine pol . Yet , by the peculiar dynamic of politics , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has become the point man for the most ambitious attempt ever at overhauling the loophole-laden tax code . " The reform hat I am wearing is not yet comfortable , " Rostenkowski cheerfully confessed to the Wall Street Journal last week . Nonetheless , the 14-term Congressman may be perfect for the task . Ultimately , late-night deals , not lofty ideals , will determine the fate of President Reagan 's plan in Congress . <P> Democratic leaders , who could hardly do otherwise , all praised Reagan 's &lt; push for reform  --  in principle , at least . But on Capitol Hill , Rostenkowski warns , the tax-reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all have an agenda of their own . " Whether the final structure will stand , or even get finished , is highly uncertain . <P> With a Democratic-dominated House and a Republican-controlled Senate , tax reform can not succeed without the support of both parties . In the afterglow of Reagan 's speech , there were ritual promises of bipartisanship , but old rivalries and resentments are sure to resurface . Rostenkowski , for one , has some scores to settle with the Reaganauts . In 1981 they lured him into supporting tax cuts and then dumped his compromise bill to pass their own . Though he was all sweetness in his TV address , Rostenkowski is " irritated " that the Reaganauts did not include him in their final deliberations on the tax plan . " They have n't talked to me in 2 1/2 weeks , " he publicly growled . <P> Democratic leaders warned that the particulars of Reagan 's proposal will have to " pass the fairness test , " as House Speaker Tip O'Neill put it . Accusing the President of caving in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading Democratic tax reformers like Richard Gephardt of Missouri have vowed to close loopholes for the wealthy left open by the President 's plan . <P> A prime Rostenkowski target will be tax breaks for the oil and gas industry . Fairness is not his only motive . A chief defender of oil and gas interests in the House is Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas , who also happens to be Rostenkowski 's main rival to succeed O'Neill when he steps down as Speaker after next year . To defeat the heavily favored Wright , Rostenkowski may try to paint him as the captive of fat cats . <P> The Democrats have to contend with their own throng of special interests . Hundreds of lobbyists who failed to win concessions from the White House began lining up three hours early for the first congressional hearing on Reagan 's proposal . " I 'm walking in an egg field , " frets Rostenkowski , a master of malapropism . He knows that a concession to one interest group risks antagonizing others .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
