ALTA , Utah - Skiers hollered throughout a three-day snowstorm last week , so they must have been very frightened . " Oh-my-God-I-don ' t-believe-it , " some exclaimed while bravely confronting over 30 inches of untouched April powder . Others resorted to denial , nervously repeating : " It just can not be . . . " Perhaps from terror , others were totally lost for words . They simply screamed , poor souls . Their howls sent chills pulsing up the spine of an Easterner whose ears rarely witness such spectacles of courage . Like lemmings ( in goggles ) they followed each other day after day , burrowing through snowflakes that exploded like goosedown at every turn . Shocks of snow burst overhead that left them gasping for air . This , of course , made them scream even more . It was all quite worrisome . Spring is a time for joy and seasonal rebirth , not worry . In the East , spring brings ski sales and the rebirth of opportunity . The $600 worth of ski equipment , usually used twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies the jetstream and long-range weather patterns to determine whether he can go another year without goggles . It is a time for love , for blossoms and birdies and filing steel edges . The steel should not be overlooked . It clung so heroically to the New England granular , that mixture of water and compressed air shot from guns that glazed each mountain from base lodge to the midway station . They use guns in Alta , too . But these guns shoot at snow . In April , the snow is still dangerously light and fluffy , so the ski patrol fires explosive shells into snow packs above the slopes or lodges . Any area that is going to avalanche does so while skiers are still asleep . Last week , it would not stop snowing - stubborn , stifling , wispy stuff , that Utah powder . So there was a lot of shooting . It got so bad last Saturday morning that the US Forest Service prohibited hotel guests from going outside until the canyon was declared safe by the US Forest Service . Signs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . Outside , 15-foot snow drifts lapped at the doors with frozen licks . But , by 9 a.m . Saturday , once the shooting was over , the signs came down and the doorways cleared of snow . Chairlift attendants cleared the loading ramps while smells of bacon still wafted through the canyon . One by one , skiers stoically rode into the enveloping snowfall and into the unknown . Oddly enough , they seemed to be singing before the snow muffled their voices into silence , leaving only the perodic thumpity-thumpity-thump as chairs passed over the lift towers . At the top of the mountain , song and humor , perhaps sparked by apprehension , came back to life . " We call this stuff frog snow out here , " yelled Paul Bergantz , a guide and member of the Alta Ski School , " because it ' s knee-deep , knee-deep , knee-deep . Get it ? Ha-ha-ha ! " He was wrong . It was waist-deep . But error of observation must be permitted in the face of challenge . This snow was both frighteningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no arrows - tracks seem to lead everywhere . It was pointed out that New England granular does not present such dilemmas , but Bergantz kept a stiff upper lip and made the best of it . Thirty inches of powder formed a cushion through which he glided - without a sound , without a scrape . Ski tips undulated from the surface to several feet underneath as he rocked up and down through each turn . He said motions used for New England granular must be exaggerated in powder . Shoulders , arms and knees must swing radically to bring the skis around . He was very brave . Bergantz explained that snow came late to Alta this winter . But now Alta has a 130-inch base and operators predict 170 inches by closing after Easter . That much snow would almost reach the ceiling of the apartment upstairs . " Skiers do not quit when the snow runs out in Alta , " Bergantz explained as he brushed away powder that had sifted through his goggle air vents and onto his eyebrows . " They quit because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skier howl.
