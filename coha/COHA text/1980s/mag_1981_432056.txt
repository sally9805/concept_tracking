 | Man is the acting animal . No other creature feels the deep-rooted need to play a role , to adopt another identity , to pretend , to imitate . Throughout history the actor has been both a source of exaltation and embarrassment ? the great Russian director Stanislayski agreed with Oscar Wilde that " an actor is either a high-priest or a clown . " Plato suggested that actors were dangerous and should be banished from the ideal state . In France the Roman Catholic Church for a long time regarded actors as sinful creatures and denied them the sacraments . Even Henry James , who tried so hard ( and ignominiously failed ) to be a successful dramatist , suggested that the theater was " best appreciated by people who are not nice ' ... " Well , nice is hardly the word to describe the modern world , so it 's no wonder that actors are all over the place . The actor seems now to stand at the heart of American life , an inescapable presence on stages , movie screens and TV tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , a craftsman , a symbol , a model , a tool , a commodity . The actor plays in Chekhov and Neil Simon , in Broadway musicals and blockbuster films , in TV sitcoms and specials , in commercials where he gives a potato chip the same contemplative intensity that Hamlet gave to Yorick 's skull . President Reagan is getting the rave reviews he never had in his Bonzo or Gipper days ; last week his political foes hailed him as a " great actor " for his budget-veto performance . Some people worry that we have in fact become a nation of actors . In his influential study " The Culture of Narcissism , " historian Christopher Lasch sees a society riddled by selfconsciousness , where men and women have " to become simultaneously role players and connoisseurs of their own performance . " Lasch and others view this theatricalization of life as a sign of our disintegrating ability to perceive objective reality . But there 's another side to the explosion of the histrionic element . In an increasingly complex society the actor can serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed of American actor seems to be doing just that . Less concerned with personality and more with an honesty of craft , actors ? performers like Treat Williams , William Hurt , Elizabeth McGovern , Amanda Plummer , Keith Gordon , Gregory Hines , Mary Steenburgen , Kevin Kline , Sigourney Weaver ? have brought a new look and a new style to American acting . They are not scornful of stardom but determined to be serious . They are breaking through the compartmentalized barriers of film , stage and TV . They bring a new energy and sincerity to the indispensable and ambiguous art of acting . Versatility is a mark of the new breed , and Treat Williams is one of its most versatile . As Danny Ciello , the corrupt narcotics cop in Sidney Lumet 's film " Prince of the City , " Williams portrayed a man both honorable and guilty , sinking with fearsome inevitability into a deeper and deeper awareness of this double bind . It was one of the longest , most intense movie roles in years , and it showed how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly the performance you might expect from the actor who played Berger , the exuberant hippie hero of the movie " Hair . " And this was hardly the actor you might think would then take on the antic part of the pirate king in Joseph Papp 's long-running Broadway production of Gilbert and Sullivan 's " The Pirates of Penzance . " He 's had to follow up Kevin Kline 's brilliant original performance , just as he had earlier gone into the cast of the hit Broadway production of " Grease " ? in a role once played by Barry Bostwick ? where director Milos Forman had spotted him and asked him to do " Hair . " " Prince of the City " was a quantum leap for Williams . As a prepschooled Episcopalian from Connecticut , he had to grasp the rhythms and rages of streetwise Italian cops under tremendous pressure . " I spent a lot of time with the cops , " says Williams . " It was very hard for them to trust me . They put a gun in my hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it back . I went on busts with cops in Harlem at 3 o'clock in the morning . I said , Jesus Christ , I may die . This is crazy . ' And then we took everybody downtown and I saw junkies pleading to go to the bathroom and vomiting and shaking . You see people of the lowest end of humanity and you know if they had a gun they 'd probably try to kill the cops . But as soon as they 're caught and handcuffed and they start to have the shakes , it breaks your heart . " This was n't the only culture shock . " We were doing a scene where I greet my cousin and I stuck out my hand . He said to Lumet , Sidney , I got a little problem here . When Italians greet each other they kiss , you know . So , Treat , if you do n't mind . ' I said , Hey , I did n't know ' . " Williams 's father worked for a chemical company in Connecticut . Treat ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included a signer of the Declaration of Independence ) went to Franklin and Marshall College and studied at the University of London . Auditions seem to have been pivotal experiences for him . At one , for a TV film about Howard Hughes , he found fifteen actors had been called for the same time . " Well , I was a tough kid and I walked up to the casting director and she said , Are you angry ? ' I said , You bet your ass I 'm angry . How dare you call all these actors ? I 'm a human being and I deserve better than this ' . " The casting director was the late Joyce Selznick , and she and Williams became friends . At another audition the producers were talking to each other during Williams 's speech . " I said to myself either you 're going to stop and tell them to go screw themselves or you 're going to see how powerful you are . How can you put all your anger into that speech ? So I did , without changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , that 's a lesson , Treat . You took all that and put it in a speech . They listened . They knew something was going on . It was a great lesson in acting . " Williams , 30 , thinks of himself not as a " new " actor but as a " traditionalist " ? " I trained classically in college , I studied light opera , I studied dance . " Beverly D'Angelo , who was in " Hair " with Williams , remembers his doing sit-ups between takes , then " dancing his heart out . He was like this little baby . You wanted to take him and hug him and say , It 's good . It 's good ' . " Lumet cast Williams in " Prince of the City " after seeing " Hair . " " He had an incredible impact , " says the director . " A life force , a kind of inner energy , bouncing off the screen . There 's no telling where he can go . " But Williams 's power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Robert De Niro , who gained 50 pounds for " Raging Bull . " " Once you get fat , you do n't lose those fat cells , " says Williams . " That 's a physically dangerous thing to do . I could never have that kind of commitment . " Williams and William Hurt are part of the Wasp element in the new wave of leading actors . But these are funky Wasps , Wasps with soul , who vibrate in harmony with the powerhouse generation of ethnic actors like De Niro ( who seems to be a role model for all the younger players ) , Al Pacino , Dustin Hoffman , John Travolta , Sylvester Stallone , Richard Dreyfuss et al . Blond , blue-eyed Bill Hurt bridles at the Wasp label . " I 'm basic Waspish , but I 'm ethnically aware , " he says . " The idea that I ca n't act a Jew , that I ca n't act the black man , Othello ? that 's crazy . " In his three major films , " Altered States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurt projects a cool , preppy-smooth surface that masks a seething fire . For three years Hurt studied theology at Tufts University . " I think I was trying to earn my stepfather 's love , " he says . " He was a highly religious man . " But Hurt dropped his religious studies ,  | deciding that " religion does not represent humanity anymore . " He was spending his senior year in London with his then wife , actress Marybeth Hurt , when he heard that a close friend had died in New York and flew there for the funeral . In New York he called up three acting schools at NYU , Yale and Juilliard . " The only one that would give me an audition was Juilliard . They said be here at 10 a.m. with 40 bucks and two pieces , one comic and one tragic , one modern and one classic . I was trying to decide if I should train as an actor in America or England . I decided on America , because I preferred the passion that seeks the form rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perfect description of the difference between the American and British acting styles . Hurt , 31 , speaks with a kind of mystical precision ; he can talk to a reporter about the mythic overtones of making love with three women , or about the Pharaohs , or about how he was at first embarrassed to do the sexy but elegant love scenes in " Body Heat . " " I 'm embarrassed about my body , " says Hurt . " I do n't bare my body easily . But in Body Heat ' I finally realized that we are always naked ? clothed or not clothed . " Hurt clearly identified with his role in " Altered States , " the young Harvard researcher who succeeds in reversing evolution to get back to the primal state . This combination of the mystic and the scientific is in tune with his own sensibility . " Christianity is screwed up , " he says . " Our representative religion in Western culture is physics . " What 's new about Hurt is this mixture of the mysterious and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Niro and Pacino ; where they are psychological jitterbugs , Hurt is a metaphysical ballet dancer . Through his girlfriend , who is a dancer with the New York City Ballet , he 's imbibed the neoclassic esthetic of George Balanchine . " He 's saying , " says Hurt , " give yourself a technique and feel through it . " Like Balanchine , Hurt scorns the empty hoopla of being a " star " and clings to the idea of craft . Like Williams , Christopher Reeve and most of the new breed , he 's a dedicated stage actor , a longtime member of New York 's Circle Repertory Company who has played everything from Hamlet to Lord Byron to the crippled , homosexual Vietnam veteran in Lanford Wilson 's " Fifth of July . " " The perfection of theater , " he says , " is that it 's over the second it 's done . It 's such an immediate and beautiful image of what acting is all about . I am a disciplined and well-trained actor . I can wrap ten meanings around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's just flagrant , baroque , useless talent . Why do I have to show off how technically proficient I am ? I have a passionate vision , but it 's there to express and not to manipulate . That 's why I call myself an actor . I take the Hippocratic oath . " It 's not easy to reconcile Hurt 's beautiful , clean acting style with his searching , elliptical speech . But both come from a fervent sincerity . He was very close to the late Paddy Chayefsky , who wrote " Altered States . " " I owe so much to Paddy , " says Hurt , " and I have cried about his death intensely . I found out in a plane , I read it over somebody 's shoulder . And I shouted spontaneously , Oh God . ' He was one of our miracles , I think . " Hurt 's idea of a Hippocratic oath for actors underscores the difference in attitude between the new breed and previous generations , which luxuriated in personality and stardom . Role models like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each new part he takes , and Meryl Streep , who combines glamour with artistic integrity , have opened the way for these superbly trained actors , who are determined to resist the vulgarization and exploitation that have swooped like buzzards upon most American theatrical careers . But for someone as young as 20-year-old Elizabeth McGovern , there is still a problem . Her success as Timothy Hutton 's understanding teen-age friend in " Ordinary People " and now as 1906 show girl Evelyn Nesbit in " Ragtime " has made her a hot property . " Adulation comes to you in strange ways , " she says . " I got such a disproportionate amount of praise for Ordinary People . ' A11 I really did was walk around those high-school halls for seven days . Now I 'm being pulled in so many different directions without having the time to figure out who I am and to slowly develop my craft . " McGovern comes from a solid middle-class upbringing in Evanston , Ill. , and Los Angeles , Calif. ? both her parents are teachers . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the many very young and very serious actors ? Tim 92 NEWSWEEK/DECEMBER 7 , 1981 NEl  | Hutton , Kristy McNichol , Jodie Foster ? who have developed in contrast to the exploitation of youngsters like Brooke Shields and Linda Blair . Because of " Ragtime , " McGovern had to drop out of Juilliard , but her first love remains the theater ; currently she 's appearing as the younger of a pair of French incestuous , murderous sisters in an off-Broadway production of Wendy Kesselman 's play " My Sister in This House . " " I believe in the theater , " she says . " I think it 's important to keep investing energy in it . " She likes film and does n't bar the possibility of TV . " A work of art must demand something of the spectator , and TV does n't demand much . What 's left in this society that 's a pulling together , a celebration ? I think it 's theater . It 's a celebration even when dealing with the dark side of things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoky blue eyes , McGovern is fast heading for the perilous whirlpools of stardom : she has won a coveted role opposite Dudley Moore in Marshall Brickman 's upcoming " Love Sick . " But there 's no doubting her determination when she says , " If I had a dream , I 'd want to be a bread-and-butter actress , someone who 's just there . " It 's still tough for women to be " bread-and-butter " performers rather than self-destructing sex bombs . Brooke Adams and Christine Lahti have antithetical problems . They are both fine actresses , but the darkly vivid , husky-voiced Adams is so damnably appealing that her serious films ( " Days of Heaven , " " Tell Me a Riddle " ) are invariably followed by cutesies like the upcoming " Utilities , " in which she plays a cop . Lahti has the strength and presence of a young Colleen Dewhurst , as she shows in the part of the doctor in the movie version of " Whose Life Is It Anyway ? " ( Her next movie is the film version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in which she plays Gary Gilmore 's cousin . ) But too many producers are intimidated by Lahti 's strength . " They still want you to be conventionally gorgeous , " she says . " I 've had friends who started off as serious actors and then decided to have various surgical changes . Now they live in Hollywood , have blond hair , little noses and large breasts . The spectrum for men is still much wider . I hope I can be one of the women to change that . " Even Hollywood-trained TV baby Kristy McNichol , now 19 and a mini-star ( " Only When I Laugh , " " White Dog " ) , rejects the traditional type of stardom . " Character parts are best , " she says over milk and Oreos in her unchic Sherman Oaks house . " They keep you working all your life if you 're good . I want to keep changing . " These new actresses seem to have almost a horror of the tacky trappings of the old-fashioned star . In this respect Faye Dunaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age star , Joan Crawford , in " Mommie Dearest , " has set the tone for the new breed of women . Twentyeight-year-old Mary Steenburgen almost goes to the other extreme when she says : " We are clowns , we are n't deities . Actors should have modesty . More heroic than my going on a film set is the guy who saved my father 's life on the operating table . " Steenburgen 's still-developing , offbeat style resulted in a delicately unsentimental portrait of a compassionate woman breaking through social convention as Mother in " Ragtime . " The wife of British actor Malcolm McDowell and the mother of their ten-month-old baby , Steenburgen says , " There 's so much emphasis on being selfish in this world , and you ca n't be when you have a child . You do feel that you 're looking in the face of the universe when you look at your child . " Such modesty does n't signal false humility . The new actors have a quiet pride , a determination to do useful work in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actors ' Equity Association , the nationwide theater union , reports that in a typical year fewer than 5 percent of the 27,000 members earn more than $10,000 , 3 percent earn $7,500-$10,000 , more than 78 per cent make less than $8,000 , more than 73 percent make less than $5,500 , 65 percent make less than $2,550 and 13 percent have no earnings at all . And the 1979 Screen Actors Guild figures range from 569 of its 48,000 members who made $100,000 or more , to the 59 percent who made less than $1,000 . " You do n't find this kind of unemployment rate in most professions , " says actor Barry Bostwick . " Most people who call themselves actors are either untrained or unprepared emotionally for the job . " Bostwick , who recently starred in the Los Angeles production of " Pirates of Penzance , " has a jaundiced view of acting , which he succinctly summarizes : " I @#  | think most actors are frauds . " Michael Ginsburg What the grisly union statistics and Bostwick 's stern comment point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies . You 're an actor if you say you are ? or a novelist or a painter or a songwriter . But nobody has to pay you unless someone sees you as the real thing . For most so-called artists the metier is a gamble , a dream or a fantasy . Director and acting teacher Michael Kahn ( who has taught Hurt , Kline and Reeve among many others ) bewails the fact that " every damn college has a drama department staffed by some failed actors . And you have all these young people who go into theater courses when they might be getting an education ? even a goddam liberal-arts education . You just want to burn down some of these schools and say to these people , Go , go out and learn something , read something . Bore yourself to death with Dostoevski . Find out what it 's like . Go read and learn ' . " The new wave of performers is trying , by and large , to lend the dignity of a vocation and a craft to this slippery fraternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acting , " the eighteenth-century French philosopher Denis Diderot asked what made people become actors and answered : " Want of education , poverty , a libertine spirit .... Never did actor become so from love of virtue , from desire to be useful in the world , or to serve his country or family ; never from any of the honorable motives which might incline a right mind , a feeling heart , a sensitive soul , to so fine a profession . " Or , as Fernando Lamas said with a Cheshire-cat grin to Burt Reynolds one night on the Johnny Carson show : " Let 's face it , Burt , you and I are bums . " Well , if so , highly paid ones . What the new breed of serious actors want is dignity for a vocation they are dedicated to . For many of them it 's as if a sense of mission informs their attitude to acting . They seem to have a communal feeling , a feeling of friendship that absorbs what Christopher Reeve calls " the challenge of your contemporaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mandy Patinkin , Patti LuPone and I were all at Juilliard , " says Reeve . " Even then you could see that they were exceptions ; you could see the versatility of Kevin Kline in The Three Sisters ' and She Stoops to Conquer . ' And then , later , in On the Twentieth Century , ' to take a nothing role and make such inventive behavior . I 'm always looking to see what Treat , Bill and Kevin are doing and I think there 's room for all of us . It 's very healthy competition . " For the best of these actors the competition is not only , or even mostly , for jobs and money , but for excellence . " I wanted to play the son in Ordinary People ' , " says Eric Roberts . " But then I saw Timothy Hutton act the hell out of it and it was OK . " Pamela Reed says , " I saw Urban Cowboy ' and wrote Debra Winger a fan letter because it 's so exciting to see someone do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , she 's good . ' I get goose bumps . You want to be surrounded by quality . " Keith Gordon gave a hair-raising performance with the Dodger Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music three seasons ago in a British play called " Gim me Shelter , " in which he played a teenage student who went bonkers and held his teachers as prisoners . The following year he played Angie Dickinson 's whiz-kid son in the movie " Dressed to Kill . " " I like to think that I 'm part of a school of actors who are character actors , chameleons , " says Gordon . Bob Balaban also calls himself a chameleon . The quintessence of the semivisible , ordinary guy , Balaban can be the iceblooded Federal prosecutor in " Prince of the City " and the seemingly patient , long-suffering husband who 's really a psychological weasel in Wallace Shawn 's play " Marie and Bruce . " These flickering character-chameleons show us ourselves with a clarity our own mirrors ca n't match . Although the new actors move with relative ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything good to say about TV except as a way to make money when needed . " I do n't want to do a TV series , " says Keith Gordon . " I do n't think it 's good for actors ; you learn a lot of tricks to make you look good . " @# @#  | Director Harold Becker ( " The Onion Field " ) came from TV , but he no longer cares for it . " TV is so restrictive . " he says . " There are so many limitations it places on the actors . Any actor doing TV knows he is making compromises , but let 's face it , these people have to make a living , too . " But the old snobbism about films among stage actors has broken down . The new actors are fascinated by the two media as different forms , different challenges . Sigourney Weaver likes the intimacy of film , but she loves the live audience . " The audience is very wise ; it teaches you , " she says . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver did " As You Like It " at the Dallas Shakespeare Festival . " There were 4,000 people a night ; it was an amazing audience ; people came with the text and read along . " For Keith Gordon , " Film is more intellectual ; it 's more of a puzzle . Theater is hard work : I 'll fight and cry with the director . But when I achieve something I want to ? a very rare experience ? it 's much more satisfying when it comes together . " Mark Hamill , the Luke Skywalker of " Star Wars , " recently did " The Elephant Man " onstage . " It was the most fulfilling thing I 've done in years , " he says . " In theater you have a chance to refine , you 're part of an ongoing thing . In movies you ca n't gripe about a scene being left out , or something lying on the cutting-room floor , since they 're paying you all that money . But how am I supposed to feel any self-respect when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ca n't even remember what I was trying to do ? " Mandy Patinkin , who won a Tony award as Che in " Evita " and played Tateh in " Ragtime , " sees the biggest difference in " the pain I have ? I work hard in theater to create a particular performance and it 's never going to always be there just that way . At least in a movie I can do it over and over and leave knowing the best I had in me is in the can . " With his new confidence , the American actor has mostly worked his way out of his historic inferiority complex about English acting . Bill Hurt prefers the American actor 's takeoff from passion rather than form . But Caitlin Clarke , one of the most intelligent American actresses , finds that the English are better at finding " the bridge " ? " the thing that carries you from the inner life of the character to what you do on the stage so the audience will get that image . " Clarke did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie " Dragonslayer " and as Susan , the heroine in David Hare 's play " Plenty , " one of the most exhaustive women 's roles in twentieth-century theater . The ideal , perhaps , is to combine American introversion and English externalization , as the Juilliard School has done in turning out actors who can do anything from Shakespeare to Broadway musicals . Some of the new actors have gone through years at a place like Juilliard ; some have had no formal training at all . In " Coal Miner 's Daughter , " Beverly D'Angelo sings splendidly as Patsy Cline , the countrysinging star who befriends young Loretta Lynn . She also projects the creative warmth of her friendship and the pathos of her early death . The performance works on so many @# @#  | levels that you may not notice in how many ways it makes you feel good . D'Angelo is a remarkable young woman , sassily beautiful with her nifty overbite , the daughter of an Ohio broadcasting executive and former big-band musician . After high school D'Angelo became a cartoon animator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing Marilyn Monroe in a Canadian TV musical and came to Broadway in an illstarred Canadian musical directed by Gower Champion . She never went to any sort of acting class . In fact , some actors think that too much training is not good . John Lithgow , a 35-year-old character actor who has played everything from the Irish sailor in O'Neill 's " Anna Christie " to the scary killer in Brian De Palma 's " Blow Out , " says : " The camera catches an actor struggling with a role and something about that struggle , that anxiety , makes the actor more appealing . I know that I can do a scene in one take that might take another actor five or six , but that competence takes away that look of insecurity which the camera catches and makes so engaging . " The point is that the American actor enjoys taking a risk . At the Actors Theatre of Louisville last spring , Michael Bogdanov , one of the leading directors of Britain 's National Theatre , was so struck with what he called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going right home and kick some of that into his perfectly schooled English actors . Howard E. Rollins , the black actor who after fourteen years onstage and in television was " discovered " for the key role of Coalhouse Walker Jr . in " Ragtime , " says : " American actors are so hot ! They have energy and intelligence . I 'd put us up against the best of them . " The contemporary " paradox of acting " may very well be that in a world where role-playing has become endemic it is the new professional actor who is the integrated personality . The man or woman who has been spending the day trying to make the appropriate gestures and speak the right lines in what sociologists call the " bureaucratization of the spirit " will welcome the sharp observa- tion and compelling performance of a William Hurt or a Treat Williams . The performance has shape . color , energy , decisiveness . The actor is not betraying himself , as the viewer may feel he has in his own life , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid , more decisive , than the viewer 's own . It may even inspire the viewer to have a stronger sense of himself . As Kevin Kline says , " Great acting reaffirms what we can be . " Behind this belief lies a special sense of mission . " Actors are helping people understand social change , " says Barry Bostwick . " That 's because drama is reflecting the social change of the time . This is the electronic age , the age of movies and television , and we are the tools of those media . " But Bostwick sees a dangerous edge to these tools . " We have created a position in the common man 's life that can not be filled by anyone else but actors , and that is escape into someone else 's dilemma and away from your own . There is a danger in becoming a country of spectators . People are not acting out in their own lives what they did 100 years ago because they 're allowing actors to do it for them . The danger is that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all the feeling , the acting-out of life , while they sit passively by , losing their active involvement in their own progression as human beings . " Even the actor can become his own spectator . " Sometimes you do n't know if you 're real anymore , " says Caitlin Clarke . " When you say I love you ' to your husband , you think , oh , it 's probably Camille . I think if you do enough tricks you go into despair because you just ca n't find anything that is n't a trick . " The new breed of actor ? gifted , skilled and dedicated ? sharpens the central paradox of man 's obsessive need to act . Today Plato might have to banish everyone from his ideal state . 96 NEWSWEEK/DECEMBER 7 , 1981
