John Smith 's airliner sat at the gate for two hours at Pittsburgh International Airport , and he was famished . What to do ? The Larkspur , Calif. , lawyer walked into the terminal building , picked up a telephone and called a local Domino 's Pizza outlet . Sure enough , 18 minutes later , a delivery boy , clad in red and blue , arrived at Gate 36 carrying a giant pizza with everything on it . Said Smith : " When I walked onto the plane with the pizza , everyone cheered . " <P> It takes hustle like the delivery boy 's to get ahead these days in the pizza business , where competition is as red hot as a pie straight from the oven . The pizza segment of the fast-food industry , overshadowed in the past by the marketing battles among the hamburger chains , has sprung to life with speedy- delivery contests , price wars and new-product campaigns . " It 's an all-out conflagration , " says Charles Henderson , vice president of marketing for Godfather 's Pizza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This will make burger wars look like a neighborhood skirmish . " Rather than fight it out , Pillsbury , the parent firm of Godfather 's , has decided to sell the chain . Herman Cain , president of Godfather 's , is leading a management takeover of the restaurants . <P> The stakes in the pie fight are high . Even as growth in fast-food sales ( 1987 U.S. total : $56 billion ) is slowing , pizza purchases are booming . Americans will spend an estimated $15 billion on pizza this year , more than twice what they spent just five years ago . As pizza has become more popular , the chains have seemingly sprinkled their outlets on every street corner : Pizza Hut , the largest , has more than 5,400 outlets in the U.S. and 6,200 worldwide . Even McDonald 's has test-marketed a pie , McPizza . With so much competition , " it 's not enough anymore just to have the best pizza in town , " says Paula Werne , editor of the trade publication Pizza Today . <P> Aside from taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is home delivery . While mom-and-pop parlors have long offered this service , the upstart Domino 's Pizza of Ann Arbor , Mich. , upped the ante . Promising a $3 discount on the price of any pie that takes longer than 30 minutes to arrive , Domino 's , now the second largest chain , has grown to 4,375 outlets . At least one Domino 's operator even delivers by boat . Art Hurteau , 29 , owner of an outlet on Missouri 's Lake of the Ozarks , maintains a fleet of ten speedboats to get pies to vacationers . Starting this week , Hurteau 's employees will be cruising the lake , taking orders from boaters and transmitting them to headquarters by radio . Pizza Hut , which in the past offered only table service and pies to go , now includes home delivery at 1,000 of its outlets . Keeping the product hot counts too : Pizza Hut claims that it delivers its pies in containers made from space-suit material , which provides extra insulation .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
