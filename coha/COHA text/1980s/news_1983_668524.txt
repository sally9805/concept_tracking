Tanglewood officially opened a week ago with programs of chamber music and a pops concert featuring " members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , " but the first real BSO concert was Friday night ; the idea was to launch the season with purpose and eclat . The " purpose " part would be taken care of by a performance of Brahms ' First Symphony , which would lead off a substantial summer-long survey of the principal works of that composer on the occasion of his 150th birthday . And Leontyne Price , the most famous of contemporary American singers , would supply the eclat by returning to the center where she was a student , and where she has not appeared since 1955 . But it didn ' t work out the way it was supposed to . Seiji Ozawa led an honorable performance of the symphony , but only a few sections got beyond what has long since been major-orchestra routine and onto a festival level of execution , let alone challenge and exploration . It was hard to feel that we had participated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price ' s appearance was peculiar ; the music ( Richard Strauss ' Four Last Songs and the final scene from " Salome " ) was not aptly chosen to demonstrate the things she can still do better than anyone else alive . The Four Last Songs , first performed in 1950 , were perhaps the last work to enter the international standard repertory immediately ; astonishingly , this was the BSO premiere , and it showed in the uncertainty of the orchestral introduction to " September , " and intermittently elsewhere . Ozawa did let the orchestra cradle Price ' s voice ; the soprano navigated around the shoals of the middle and lower register with extreme caution , and paid scant attention to verbal and poetic values . An occasional soft , high phrase became a poetic value in itself , as we listened once again , enraptured , to one of the most beautiful sounds in the world - this happened in " Beim Schlafengehen " when Price took up the song of the violin , and again at the end of " Im Abendrot , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene from " Salome " was grotesque in all the wrong ways . Sometime hearing a beloved singer in an uncongenial assignment can show her artistry and musicianship more clearly than something that is easy for her . There was perhaps more of the essential Callas in her struggle to be Madama Butterfly than in her easy success as Tosca , where she simply did what came naturally . But that wasn ' t a reward of this excerpt from " Salome . " Price used every trick in the book to make herself heard - spitting out the consonants , singing before and behind the beat , carrying the chest register way up into the middle of the voice , adding and taking out vibrato so that she sounded like a police siren in some of the phrases . There was a " what have I got to lose ? " quality that was hard to resist . But nothing about it was right ; you wouldn ' t ask the Statue of Liberty to slaver over the silver salver bearing the head of John the Baptist , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
