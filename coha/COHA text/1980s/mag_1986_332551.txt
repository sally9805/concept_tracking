It is the most profitable corporation in the world , but lately IBM has been giving more than receiving . Without fanfare or explanation , the computer giant revealed last week that it was cutting wholesale prices on several of its personal computers , including its top-of-the-line PC-AT , as much as 18% . At the same time , sources within Big Blue 's network of 2,500 dealers said that the company will now allow them to return unsold inventory without penalty , and that it will shoulder a larger share of their advertising and promotional costs . <P> Despite the lack of official comment from IBM , the reason for its generosity was obvious : the company is trying hard to rebuild its dwindling share of the $10 billion-ayear personal-computer market . Only 14 months ago , IBM commanded 40% of sales , largely on the strength of the $1,995 PC , which had become an industry standard . Since then , however , a slew of small , feisty computer makers have stolen away a hefty chunk of IBM 's business by building personal computers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the cost . The sellers of these so-called IBM-compatibles , companies such as Leading Edge , Epson and Kaypro , have snared an impressive 36.4% of the personal-computer market , while IBM 's share has fallen to 33% . Says John Roach , chairman of Tandy , which manufactures a $999 model : " 1986 will be the year of the PC-compatible . " In the past few weeks the field has grown still more crowded . Two big California retail chains , Businessland and Compu terland , said they would begin marketing IBM-compatibles under their own names . <P> By replicating the guts of the IBM machine and offering it at a lower price , the compatibles have ushered in an era in which personal computers are commodities that are differentiated not by quality but by price . Indeed , true bargain hunters can even buy so-called clones , which are ultracheap compatibles that lack the service and repair guarantees that higher-priced units offer . In the past 18 months or so , many former customers of IBM have decided that they do not need to buy high-priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Michael Geran , a computer-industry analyst for E.F . Hutton : " The IBM label has lost some of its magic . The three initials I , B , M , no longer justify the price differential . " <P> Many top sellers of compatibles and clones are able to put low prices on their computers because they are produced by low-wage laborers in Asian countries , notably South Korea and Taiwan . Perhaps the most aggressive of these firms is the Canton , Mass. - based Leading Edge , which is run by Michael Shane , a wealthy entrepreneur who first made big profits by selling blue jeans and wigs . In early 1985 , while other companies like Compaq were making IBM- compatibles and selling them at IBM prices , Shane began buying state-of- the- art computers from Daewoo , the South Korean electronics giant , and offering them in the U.S. for $1,495 . Although the personal-computer market was virtually comatose at the time , Shane stunned industry experts by selling an estimated 50,000 units in his first year of operation .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
