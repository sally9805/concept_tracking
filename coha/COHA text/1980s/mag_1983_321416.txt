Pranksters disrupt a hospital , and nobody is laughing <P> The red brick Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on Manhattan 's Upper East Side is an example of advanced medical technology . Every year more than 10,000 patients , ranging from infants with leukemia to statesmen with brain tumors , are admitted to this world-renowned research hospital , where they are analyzed , probed and treated by the most sophisticated high-tech equipment available . There are giant X-ray scanners , imaging devices and accelerators for beaming particles on diseased tissues , many operating under computer control . <P> One Friday morning last June , Chen Chui , systems manager of the hospital 's medical physics computer service , discovered to his great astonishment that a Digital VAX 11/780 computer , which monitors the radiation treatment for 250 patients , had inexplicably failed during the night . Looking into the machine 's log , he found that a file of billing records worth about $1,500 was missing and that passwords had been issued to five unauthorized accounts . Chui deleted the new names and took the extra precaution of replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Chui hoped that that would be the last of it . It was not . After the weekend he discovered that someone had made contact with the computer through a telephone hookup and introduced a new program : whenever a legitimate user typed in his password , the code name was immediately sent to the intruder . " It was panic , " says Dr. Radhe Mohan , director of the computer service . " Someone was up to big mischief that could have conceivably caused harm . " <P> Sloan-Kettering officials called the New York City police , the FBI and New York Telephone security , which tapped the phone lines connected to the machine . Then Chui tried to reach the intruders by leaving messages in their computer terminals . " You have done some harm to the system , " read one plea . " Please call us and help us repair the damage . " About an hour after the message went out , someone called back . " He said he was sorry , " recalls Chui . " But when we asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The intruder appeared chastened , yet over the next two months there were about 20 other calls to the computer ; the most recent took place on Aug. 11 . In July the hospital received a tip identifying two young men in the Milwaukee area as the source of the trouble . The two were innocent , but the Milwaukee connection turned out to be the break that police needed . For months , FBI agents had been tracking the activities of a loosely organized gang of computer enthusiasts in and around Milwaukee who call themselves " the 414s " after that city 's telephone area code . Using home computers connected to ordinary telephone lines , they had been breaking into computers across the U.S. and Canada , including one at a bank in Los Angeles , another at a cement company in Montreal and , ominously , an unclassified computer at a nuclear weapons laboratory in Los Alamos , N. Mex.
