" The Kawasaki was an LTD 750 twin with a belt drive , an ' 83 model which Harry had bought at the year-end sale in ' 84 . He had saddlebags for it and a carry rack for his guitar . Two weeks ago he had borrowed Arline Mott 's pickup truck and taken the engine in . He was driving the same pickup truck now , and he felt guilty about it . He 'd telephoned Arline at 5:00 A.M. , before she 'd been up or able to listen to the radio . " I 'll have it back by noon , " he 'd said . Since Arline did n't get up before noon , that would n't be a problem . She 'd put the key outside her door and gone back to bed . She ought to be getting the hell out of Los Angeles ! If I 'd told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , who would ? And she 'd be in bed until noon anyway . So all I have to do is get the damn truck back to her . He pulled into a 76 station . There were three cars ahead of him . He filled the truck , then filled two gas cans Arline kept in the back . Least I can do for her . Gas was still being sold at the pump prices . That could n't last . He drove North along Van Nuys Boulevard . The tools and all of the Kawasakiexcept the engine were in the back . It was still in pieces . A glance at Road and Track Specialties , which specialized in racing motorcycles , sent him off on a daydream . He really ought to steal one of those . It would get him there faster and more dependably , if he did n't get himself arrested , and certainly the emergency justified it . . . he drove past without slowing , and on to Van Nuys Honda-Kawasaki . His walk slowed as he passed through the salesroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new fender , spare brake and clutch levers , a fairing . . . Jesus , that Vetter Windjammer fairing was nice . I could use the emergency thousand that Wes keeps  --  Only that would n't work . That thousand belonged to Carlotta , and Harry intended to take it to her . Not all , but as much as possible . No Vetter fairing , then . Just tic-down straps , and paper bags to put his hands in . I le stepped up to the counter , next to a bulky , younger man.  | " Hairy Red , " the man said . Harry almost recognized him ; the name would n't surface . " How they hanging ? " " This is the day nobody knows that , " Harry said . " Did you see the light show ? " " Damn right . I 'm getting out . " " I 'm headed east . I could use a partner . " " North looks safer , " the half stranger said . Harry nodded ; he agreed . When a clerk appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wes Dawson 's thousand . He paid for the engine repairs and restrained the urge to buy anything . He might need money more . He brought truck and engine to the parking lot across the alley from the motorcycle shop . The transistor radio was telling the world that there had been a horrible mistake . The aliens had attacked certain parts of the United States and the rest of the world , but now they were going away . The delegation that had been aboard the Soviet Kosmograd had been taken aboard by the aliens . Negotiations were proceeding . Citizens should remain calm . Anyone who could go to work should do that . Conserve electricity and water . Do n't waste anything . There would be inconveniences . Expect rationing soon . That was one station . On another , the announcer was hysterical . The Martians had landed in New Jersey . The one thing that every station announced was that all military and police personnel were to report for duty immediately . Harry began to work . An hour later he had some appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening now around Carlotta Dawson ? And where , in hell or heaven , was Congressman Wes ? ) and the certain knowledge that hurrying was a mistake . His vertebrae , dreaming that they had become solid bone , woke to grating agony as he lifted and twisted and crouched and crawled . He worked muscles that had forgotten their function . They protested and were ignored . He worked as he had to , letting details fill his mind from edge to edge . It was like the calm from being ripped on marijuana , or ( he presumed ) from transcendental meditation . He had read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance long ago . It was killing labor , and Harry was drenched with sweat . He was old , old . But the Kawasaki was a motorcycle again . This would be a hellish shakedown tour for a newly mounted engine . Harry smoked while the crankcase drained onto the weeds . He refilled it with a very light oil . He started the engine and let it run for the life span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refilled it with a heavier oil . Puffing , he began to pack the Kawasaki . The sleeping bag went on the rack . It would normally carry his guitar , but not this trip ! He 'd already turned that over to Lucy Mott for safekeeping . He ran his spare cables alongside the working cables , ready to be attached in an instant . Ile reachedp153into the fuel tank 's wide-mouthed fill  --  was there anyone to see ?  --  to attach the gold peso and the dimes . Carlotta Dawson 's .45 auto went under the seat , with two clips . The .25 Beretta was in his jacket pocket . A one-quart botta bag was more convenient than a canteen for drinking while riding ; he 'd want to fill it before he left . What had he forgotten ? He had spare belts , high-speed belts built for industry , which fit the cycle and cost a quarter as much as store-bought . I -- Ie checked everything : spare oil , ratchet set , screwdriver set , four wrenches , electrical tape , spare fuses , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit . Spare clothing in a plastic garbage bag . The binoculars . Finally he buckled on the wide kidney belt . It reduced his stomach by inches , and made him feel ten years younger . He went to the head shop next door for cigarettes . There was only one clerk , and Harry was surprised to see her . " Ruby ? " " Yeah , man . How 's it , Harry ? " " I thought you 'd be in the mountains by now , " Harry said . She looked puzzled . " Aliens ? Space war ? Lights in the sky ? " She laughed . " What you need , Harry ? " " Two cartons of Pall Mall . No filter . Ruby , you told me about it . " She got out the cigarettes . Harry handed her money , and she gave him back change . No premium price . " Told you about what ? " " What I said . Space War . " She laughed again . " I thought I remembered calling somebody ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wow , that Colombian stuff is strong , I tarry . I really thought it was real ! " He was still shaking his head when he got outside . It was tough loading the Kawasaki into the truck , but he got help from the guys in the shop . Got to return the truck , he told himself . Got to . Fifteen hundred miles , near enough . Wish I did n't have to take the truck back . Ought to get started . . . Hell , it 's only five miles to Arline 's place . Damn near on the way . Let 's get it done . If he 'd been in a car , he 'd never have made it . All the highways out of Los Angeles were jammed . Cars all over the road . Cars stalled on the wrong side of the road , people driving on the left side , anything to get out . And then the first wrecks , and the endless fields of cars behind them . Many were piled high with clutter . Baby cribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any damned thing you could think of , lashed on top of the cars . One king-size mattress on top of a car full of kids .

Harry had to take out Dawson 's letter a dozen times , until he was good with the spiel.  | " I 'm Congressman Wes Dawson 's assistant , " Harry would say . " He 's aboard the alien ship . I have to look after his wife . " One of the national guardsmen even said " sir " to Harry after he 'd seen the letter . " Heard much , Sergeant ? " " No , sir . They hit Hoover Dam . We know that much . Seem to have hit a lot of dams and power plants and railroad yards . Nobody knows why . Now they 've gone . " Harry nodded sagely . " Thanks . " Then he could n't resist . " Carry on , Sergeant , " he said , and roared off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east across the Mojave Desert . His back had begun to hurt.  |p155Jeri  Wilson woke with a start . The sun was in the west , sinking toward one of the snowcapped peaks that surrounded the twisting mountain road . Melissa sat quietly in the backseat . " It 's after noon , " Jeri said accusingly . " Why did you let me sleep so long ? " " You looked like you needed it . " Jeri yawned . " I guess I did , punkin . " She glanced at the seat beside her , then looked down at the floor . " Where 's the map ? " " I have it , " Melissa said . " I was trying to figure out where we are , but I ca n't . " She handed over the Auto Club map . Jeri traced a yellow line along the map . " I 'm not exactly sure myself , " she admitted . " I thought about what you said and decided we did n't want to go through Albuquerque . Hairy Red marked a route up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twists and turns . Good thing you slept through it ; you 'd have got carsick . " " So how far is it now ? " " About three hundred miles in a straight line , but I do n't know how far on the road . " " Is  --  does Daddy really know we 're coming ? " " Well  --  sort of . " " Does he want us to come ? "  | " I think so , " Jeri said . He did n't say no ! " Pour me some coffee from the Thermos . We 've got to cross the Continental Divide this afternoon . Best we get started . " Jeri coasted down the twisting Rocky Mountain roads in low gear , with the motor turned off , scared as stiff as the unpowered power steering . The highway was nearly deserted . Twice she pulled off for huge trucks , then used the motor to get back on the road . Once a Corvette shot into her rearview mirror , fishtailed as the driver saw her , and was still wobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backseat , did n't wake up . The highway began to straighten out as it reached the bottom . The Great Plains stretched infinitely ahead . Jeri took the car out of gear , started the motor to get her brakes and steering back , and reached the Great Plains doing sixty in neutral . She waited until she 'd lost some speed before going into gear . It was mid-afternoon of a cloudless day . Behind her the Rockies , receding , seemed to grow even larger as the scale came into focus : a wall across the west of the world . She held her speed at fifty-five . She jumped when she realized Melissa was peering over her shoulder . Melissa said , " When the gas needle says Empty , how much gas is left ? " " I do n't know . Could be anywhere from none to ... five ? " They 'd be out of gas soon . All she could think of was to get as far as she could . Maybe there would be gasoline at the next station , wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a spotlight in her eyes . She slapped the mirror aside and screamed , " Do n't look , Melissa ! Get down on the floor ! " Hoping Melissa would obey ; wishing she could do the same . Braking carefully , edging toward the right lane . Melissa said , " What  --  " WHAM ! Ears popped , the car lurched , the rear window crazed and went opaque . She 'd expected it to shatter , to lace her head and neck with broken glass . The news had spoken of bombs falling on hydroelectric dams , railroads , major highways . George and Vicki Tate-Evans had told her ( speaking in relay , impossible to interrupt ) how to recognize a thermonuclear bomb flash , and how to survive . She pulled off the road and waited . When you see the whole world turn bright , do n't look . Drop to the ground . Grip your legs , put your head between your knees . Now kiss your ass good-bye . Behind her , a Peterbilt ten-wheeler that had been charging up on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its side , leaving a trail of fire as it slid past and finally came to a stop ahead of her . " Atomic bomb , " Melissa said , awed . " Stay down ! " " I am. "  |p157A  man crawled out of the truck shaking his head . That really was n't much of a fire : just a streak leading to the truck , a few flames under it . Maybe the truck was out of gas too . She waited for the softer WHAM ! , the second shock wave as air rushed back to fill the vacuum beneath the rising fireball . When the station wagon stopped shuddering she pulled around the burning truck and kept going . A flaming toadstool lit her way . She kept glancing back , watching it die . She made another six miles before the motor died . She hoped they were far enough from the radioactive cloud . She hoped it would n't rain . The old one-lung Harley had begun sputtering ten miles back . Now it died . Gynge let it coast and thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hundred miles , but the damned thing had been nearly dead last year . It was n't getting younger . He could walk . There had to be something better . Up ahead was a rest area . Gynge let the Harley 's last momentum take it off the edge of the highway and into the picnic area . The highways were deserted . At first the cops and national guards were stopping everything . Gynge had detoured three times around them . Damn good thing he knew the country . After he got into the mountains he left the main roads . There were n't any cops at all . A semi roared past . There was a little traffic . Food trucks . Come to that , in normal times one out of every three trucks carried food . People had to eat . But there was n't a hell of a lot except trucks . The rest area was empty . Almost empty . Not quite . He heard sounds at the far end , and went to investigate . What Gynge saw was a tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a girdle stretched out beside him . Bikers called it a " kidney belt , " but it did the same thing any girdle did : it held in a sagging gut . The old man 's gut was a good-sized beer belly . He was trying to hug one knee against his chest , but his gut blocked the way . The man sat up , blowing . His frame was large ; Gynge saw that he must have been formidable in his time . He did n't look formidable now . His red heard had gone mostly gray , and the hair of his head was following . He sat up , consulted the book beside him . Then he stretched his right leg out in front of him , bent forward as far as he could manage , threw a hand towel around the arch of his foot , and pulled on both ends . If the man had brought friends , they had had plenty of time to appear . Gynge watched a little longer . The red-and-gray-haired man switched legs , groaning . One full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the picnic table and groaned . Two whiplash accidents within two weeks would leave their mark for the rest of his life . His spine felt like a crystal snake dropped on flagstones ! He knew well enough that he was overweight . That was what the kidney belt was for , but it had n't been enough , and his guts were about to fall out all over the picnic table . He 'd bought a book of stretching exercises . Some of those were supposed to help a bad back . It was worth a try . . . but it felt like he was breaking his back rather than mending it . He had switched legs before the stranger stepped into view . A biker , probably . He strolled up to Harry 's bike , in no apparent hurry ; ran his eyes over it ; then stepped up to Harry . Looming . He was all muscles and hair and dirt , no prettier than Harry felt , though younger and in better condition . He asked , " Why a towel ? " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A towel is the most massivelyuseful thing a traveler can have . And that was a stretching exercise , because my back is giving me hell . See  --  " " Skip it . Give me the key to the Kawasaki . " " Help me up . " The bandit did , by the slack of Harry 's jacket . He looked down at the feel of something hard over his heart . Harry 's jacket trailed from his hand , and the .25 Beretta was in the jacket pocket . " I hold the key to a door you do n't want to open , " Harry said . Anyone with a grain of sense would have at least stopped to think it over . The bandit reacted instantly : he batted at the threatening hand and swung a fist at Harry 's jaw . Harry fired at once . The fist exploded against his jaw and knocked him dizzy . His gun hand was knocked aside too . Harry brought it back and fired twice more , walking the pistol up the man 's torso . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't very loud . It was n't big either , and Harry did n't entirely trust a .25 bullet . Any sign of a companion ? No . The bandit was still on his feet , looking startled . Harry fired twice more , reserving one bullet for mistakes . Now the bandit toppled . Harry had spent some time finding the campground , but it would n't be possible to stay . He rolled off the table , pulled his pants on , then his kidney belt . He paused to catch his breath and to listen . The bandit was still breathing , almost snoring . Harry looked down at him . " I 'll do you the best favor I can , " he said . " I wo n't check to make sure you 're dead . " The wounded man said nothing . Ah , well . Harry walked his bike to the bandit 's motorcycle . There was nearly a gallon of gasoline in it . Whistling , Harry disconnected the fuel line and drained the gas into a pickle jar he fished out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop into the Kawasaki , he went through the bandit 's possessions . There was n't much.  |p159Then  he mounted the Kawasaki and rode away , groaning . Harry was a firm believer in natural selection . Jeri woke at dawn . Melissa was awake , but huddled in her sleeping bag . " I never knew deserts could be cold , " she said . " I told you , " Jeri said . " Now watch . " The sleeping bags were head to head , with the Sierra stove between . Jeri made two cups of cocoa without poking more than her head and shoulders out of her bag . In the half-hour they spent drinking cocoa and eating oatmeal , the world warmed . Jeri put her hat on and made Melissa don hers . They left their sleeping bags and rolled them with one eye each on the highway below . They had moved uphill , away from the car , into a clump of bushes at the crest . With heads above the bushes , using binoculars , they could see clearly for miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken by a dish-shaped crater nine miles to the west . The precision of that crater grew scarier the more Jeri thought about it . It sat precisely on the intersectionof two highways . They watched for traffic . Jeri 's hand kept brushing the hard lump in her purse , the .380 Walther automatic . If she saw a safe-looking ride , she and Melissa could get down to the highway in time to stick out their thumbs . She had n't seen much yet . Traffic was nearly nonexistent . A clump of four motorcycles had passed , slowed to examine the stalled car , argue , then move on west . She stayed hidden . " What will we do ? " Melissa asked . " We 'll think of something , " Jeri told her . I may have to pay for a lift . Hopefully with money . She prayed for a policeman , but there were n't any . Someone ought to come look at the crater . Is it radioactive ? And why here ? What Could aliens possibly care about , this far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It slowed as it approached the crater . Jeri wondered if it would turn back . It moved out into the desert and circled the lip of the crater . Big cycle , big rider . He had some trouble lifting it back onto the road . He rested afterward , smoking , then started up again . They watched him come . Ten minutes later Melissa lowered the binoculars and said , " It 's Harry . " Jeri snorted . " It 's Hairy Red , Mom . Let 's go down . " " Unlikely , " Jeri said wearily , but she took the glasses . The lone biker 's head was a wind-whipped froth of red hair and beard ; that was true enough . lc kept the bike slow . He could n't be a young man , not with the trouble he 'd had lifting the bike . The bike : it sure looked like Harry 's bike . Hell 's hells , that was Harry Reddington ! " Go , " Jeri said , " run ! " She sprinted downhill . Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom well ahead of the hiker . Jeri puffed and got her wind back and screamed , " I Tarry ! I larreee ! "  |p160It  did n't look like he would stop . Harry saw the four bikers coming from a long way off . They were on the wrong side , his side , of the dirt divider . He was seeing trouble as he neared them . . . but they veered across the divider and , laughing , doffed their helmets to him as he passed . Harry would have liked to return the gesture , but he had one hand on the handlebars and one on the gun Carlotta had n't taken . . . because Hairy Red sure was n't in shape to defend himself with his fists . His belly band was tightened to the last notch , and Harry felt like he was leaking out from under it . Beyond the bikers was a station wagon , presumed DOA . Beyond the wagon , two figures running downhill . Harry made out a woman and a little girl . He did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . They were yelling at him . The adult was a goodlookingwoman , and it was with some regret that he twisted the accelerator .  --  " Harreee ! " Oh , shit . Harry 's hands clamped the brakes . Jeri and Melissa Wilson , standing in the road . Just what he needed . Your word of honor on record , he thought . Dead or captured by God knows what , Wes Dawson had left his life on Earth 's surface in Harry Reddington 's care . Carlotta Dawson was n't the type to survive without help . Stuck out here with a dead station wagon , what were the chances that Jeri Wilson and her daughter would ever tell anyone that Hairy Red had driven past them ? He twisted harder , and stopped precisely alongside Melissa , and smiled at the little girl . Shit . Harry Reddington climbed from the bike as if afraid he 'd break , and straightened up slowly . " Jeri . Melissa . Why are n't you at the Enclave ? " " I have to find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going ? " Harry answered slowly ; he seemed to be doing everything slowly . " I was staying at Congressman Dawson 's house . Now his wife is in Dighton , Kansas , and he sure ca n't do anything to take care of her , so it 's up to me . " " Well . Want some cocoa ? " " Sure , but  --  You 've got a Sierra stove ? " " Up the hill . " " What 's wrong with the car ? " " Out of gas . " " Let 's get that cocoa . " Harry accepted Jeri 's hospitality knowing full well what it implied , knowing that it was too late . Three passengers on a motorcyclewas going to kill his shock absorbers . " Those hushes at the top ? I 'd better ride the bike up . I 'd hate to lose it . "  |p161Harry  let the bike coast to a stop . It was hot as soon as they stopped moving . Harry poured a little water onto his bandana and mopped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloody hell . " We 're almost there , " Jeri said . " Why are you stopping ? " " Got to , " Harry said . " Everybody off . " Melissa leaped off from her perch on the gas tank in front of Harry . Jeri climbed off the back . Every muscle complaining , Harry slowly got off and set the stand . Then he tried to bend over . " Back-rub time ? " Jeri asked . " Ca n't hurt , " Harry said . He pointed to a stream that ran beside the road . " Melissa , how about you go fill the canteens . " " Does n't look very clean  --  " " Clean enough , " Harry said . " Pour all the water we have into one canteen and just fill the other from the stream , " Jeri said . " Harry , you look like a letter S. Here , bend over the bike and I 'll work on that . " Harry waited until Melissa was gone . " I do n't quite know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but somebody 's got to . We 're almost there . Another ten , twelve miles  --  " " Yes . Thank you . I know it was out of your way , and it ca n't be comfortable , riding three on a bike  --  " " It 's not , but that is n't the problem , " Harry said . " You got across the Colorado River the day before the aliens came , did n't you ? " " Yes  --  " " And all you 've seen since is a few towns , and that crater . " " Harry , what are you trying to say ? " " I looked on the map . That town you 're headed for  --  there 's a dam just above it . " He did n't say anything for a moment , to let that sink in . " Jeri , I goddam near did n't get across the Colorado River . There 's nothing left of the town of Needles . Or Bullhead City . Or anything along the Colorado . They hit Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it scoured out everything for two hundred miles . I mean everything . Dams , bridges , houses , boats  --  all gone . I had to get a National Guard helicopter to take me and the motorcycle across . " " Oh . " " Yeah . So I do n't know what we 're going to find up ahead . You got any idea of where Dave lived in that town ? " " No , " Jeri said . " He never told me anything about it . Harry  --  Harry , it 's got to be all right . " " Sure , " Harry said . He could n't even try to sound sincere . One more rise . Over the top of that little ridYe  --   |p162Jeri  sat uncomfortably among the gear tied to the bike . She could n't stop crying . Wind-whipped , the tears ran tickling across her temples and into her hair . Damn it , I do n't know anything yet , why am I crying ? At least Melissa ca n't see . What should I tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the ridge . A sea of mud lay below . The reservoir had been ten miles long and over a mile wide ; now there was only a thick sluggish ripple at its center , a tiny stream with obscenely swollen banks . A thick stench rose from the mud . They rode slowly , feeling that hot wind in their faces , smelling ancient lake bed mud . There was no need to tell Melissa anything . She could see the dead lake , and must be able to guess what was ahead . It used to be we could protect children , spare them from horrible sights . They always do that in the old novels . They rode along the mud banks toward the ruins of the dam at the far end . Long before they reached the dam there were new smells mingled with the smell of decayed mud and the hot summer . Everywhere lay the smell of death . The town below the dam was gone . In the center the destruction was complete , as if a bulldozer had come through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread mud over the foundations . Farther away from the stream bed was a thin line of partially destroyed houses and debris . One house had been torn neatly in half , leaving three-walled rooms to stare out over the wreckage below . Above the debris line nothing was touched . People moved among the debris , but few ventured down into the muddy bottom area . They 've given up looking for survivors . She could feel Harry 's chest and back tighten as they got closer to the ruined town . A sheriff 's car stood beside a National Guard jeep to block the road . Harry let the bike coast to a stop . He had his letter ready to show , but it was n't needed . " I am Mrs. David Wilson , " Jeri said . " My husband lives here , at 2467 Spring Valley Lane  --  " The young man in sheriff 's uniform looked away . So did the Guard officer . She knew before the sergeant spoke . " You can see where Spring Valley Lane was , just down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pointed at the center of the mud flat . " Maybe he was n't home , " Melissa said . " Maybe  --  " " It happened about two in the morning , " the sergeant said . " Maybe five minutes after they blasted the Russian space station . " " Warning did n't help anyway , " the deputy sheriff said . " They did somethingthat knocked out the phone system at the same time . The only way we could warn anybody downstream was to try to drive faster than the water . That was n't good enough . "  | " How bad was it ? " Harry asked . " Bad , " the Guard officer said . " The whole Great Plains reservoir system , everything along the Arkansas River , is gone . There 's flooding all the way to Little Rock and beyond . " He drew Harry aside , but Jeri could make out what he was saying . " There 's a temporary morgue in the schoolhouse three miles east ofhere , " the officer was telling Harry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've had to bury a couple of hundred . Maybe more . They 've got a list of all they could identify . " " Thanks . I guess we better go there . Anyplace I can get some gas ? " The officer laughed . The wallet held two pictures of Jeri and one of Melissa . Jeri stared at her own face distorted by the tears that kept welling in her eyes . My pictures . I think he would have been glad to see me . The driver 's license was soaked , but the name was readable . " That 's his , " Jeri said . The thinly bearded young man in dirty whites made notes on a clipboard . " David J. Wilson , of Reseda , California , " he said . " Next of kin , Mrs. Geraldine Wilson  --  " He went on interminably . He took David 's wallet and went through that , noting down everything inside it . Finally he handed her a shoe box . It contained the wallet , a wristwatch , and a wedding ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box out into the bright Colorado sunshine . My God , what am I going to do now ? There was no sign of Harry or Melissa . She sat down on a bench by the school . What do they want ? Why are they doing this ? Why ? " Mom  --  " Jeri did n't want to look at her daughter . " Harry told me , Mom . " Melissa sat beside her on the bench . After a moment Jeri opened her arms , and they held each other . " We have to go , " Melissa said . " Go ? " " With Harry . " " Are we  --  where are we going with Harry ? " " Dighton , Kansas , " Harry said from behind her . " And we got to be starting right now , Miz W. We 're on the wrong side of the river , and there are n't any bridges downstream at least as far as Dodge City . We have to go upstream and cross above where the reservoir was . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . We need to get started . " Jeri shook her head . " What  --  I do n't know anyone in Kansas . " " No , ma'am , and I do n't either , except Mrs. Dawson . " Harry snorted . It was easy to tell what he was thinking . Harry Red had no woman of his own , just other people 's widows .. . " I tarry , you do n't want us on your bike . "  | " I sure do n't , " he said . " What 's that got to do with anything ? " Melissa stood and pulled her by the hand . " Come on , Mom , we do n't want to stay here . " I might meet David 's friends . Find out how he spent his last monthsThat 's morbid , and you 'll more likely meet his New Cookie . Or was she with him ? Did the Earth move for you , sweetheart ? " All right , let 's go , then . Harry , I thought you were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Melissa said . " Talked the highway patrolman into a full tank for the motorcycle . " " Should get us there , " Harry said . He led the way around the corner . The bike stood there . It did n't look in very good shape . It looked overloaded even with no one on it . " Even loaded down with three ? " " Should . " Harry climbed aboard , groaning slightly . He looked a little better ; the monstrous belly was tighter , and his back was n't quite so thoroughlybent . " Anyplace you want to go first ? " he asked . Jeri shook her head . " They ... "  --  she took Melissa 's hand  --  " they buriedover a hundred in a common grave . I do n't want to see that  --  " " Me , neither , Mom . " Melissa hopped onto the bike in front of Harry . The young are so damned  --  resilient . I guess they have to be . Especially now . Jeri crammed the shoe box into the saddlebag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm ready . " She did n't look back as they drove out of the town.  |p165They  were through the last of the foothills and into the rolling prairies of Kansas , a land of straight roads and small towns . Wheat and cornfields made the landscape monotonous . Whenever they stopped , the hot winds and bright sunshine drove them back into motion again . Conversation was impossible over the noise of the motorcycle . The radio had nothing to say . Harry drove mindlessly , trying not to think of his back and the cramps in his legs . Fantasies came easily . Keri 's a right pretty woman , and she 's all alone . Do n't know what she 'll do in Kansas . Maybe there ' would n't be enough rooms . They 'd have to share a room and a bed , and the first night he could just hold her , andPart of his mind knew better , but the thoughts were more pleasant than his back pains . Dighton , Kansas , was forty miles ahead . The engine sputtered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it , with a dozen miles to spare . Good enough , thought Harry . Good enough . There was a smaller city four miles away . Logan , Kansas . Nothing to stop there forThere was a bright flash ahead and to the left . " Holy shit ! " Harry shouted . He clamped the brakes , skidding the bike to a halt . " Offl Off and down ! " He 'd heard George and Vicki 's lectures too . Jeri and Melissa threw themselves into the ditch alongside the road . Harry laid the motorcycle down . Ile found he 'd been counting . It wasp166nearly a minute before thunder rolled over them . There was n't any shock wave . " Ten , twelve miles , " Harry said . " We were closer to the other one , " Melissa said . She was trying to look brave and calm , but she was having trouble forgetting that she was a tenyear-oldgirl who 'd been protected all her life . There were more rumblings , a series of sonic booms , and the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth bombing here ? " Harry asked . Jeri sat up . She shook her head . " I do n't  --  Harry ! " She pointed up . Somethingdart-shaped crossed the sky , high up , glowing orange at the nose and leaving a wavery vapor trail . " What is that ? " Harry shook his head . The fading vapor trail curled and twisted . Winds did that in the high stratosphere . " Russian ? Not like any American plane I ever saw . " They looked at each other in wonder . " Naw , " Harry said . " It could n't be . " The craft was already too small to see . . . until it began blinking , pulsing in harsh blue pinpoints of light , like the lights Harry had seen that first night . Dust motes were drifting out of the vapor trail . Another ship crossed the bright sky , and another , on skewed paths . Dust sifted from the vapor trails . The motes left by the first ship were growing larger , becoming distinct dots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth ship . . . and the first two were pulsing now , pulling away . They must be much larger than they seemed . Thirty miles up or more : they had to be that high , given what they were doing . They were streaking through the high atmosphere at near-orbital speed , dropping clouds of .. . dots , then accelerating free of Earth . So . Dots ? The fourth ship was n't pulsing . It was turning , banking in a wide arc . The dots had become falling soap bubbles , and the lowest of them were breaking open . Hatching . Hatching winged things " Paratroopers , " Melissa said . Her voice held wonder . " Mom , they 're invading ! " At nearly sixty-four makasrupkithp of altitude* the troposphere tore at the hull , blasting the digit ship with flame . Its mass seemed no more protection than the transparent bag around Octuple Leader Chintithpit-mang . The planet was all of his environment , vast beyond imagination , and dreadfully close . Thirty to thirty-five miles . ( A standard trunklcngth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 512 srupkithp = 1 makasrupk = 905.13 meters. )  |p167He  was one in eight rows of sixty-four bubbles each , and each flaccid bubble held a fi ' , his face hidden by an oxygen mask . He was first in his line , with the transparent door just a srupk from his face . They were holding up well . Why not ? The lowest ranks were all sleepers . A planet was nothing new to a sleeper . This must be like homecoming to them . As for the spaceborn , the Octuple Leaders and higher ranks , how could they let the sleepers sec their fear ? And yetAft is raw chaos , a roiling white fog of vapor trail . But look down , where greens and blues and browns sweep beneath . Here the patterns are equally random , for worlds happen by accident , and there is no sign of mind imposingorder . Layers of curdled water vapor almost make patterns . They seem more real , more solid , than the land . The snaky curve of yonder river holds more water than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line of mountains they 'd crossed a few 64-breaths ago would outmass the Foot itself " Octuples , you disembark now . " Octuple Leader Chintithpit-mang 's breathing became shallow , fast . He had been born in the year that Thuktun Flishithy rounded this world 's primary star . The Year Zero Herd had all been born within a couple of eight-days of each other  --  naturally  --  and that age group was closer than most . One and all , males and females , they were dissidents . They had no use for worlds . Chintithpit-mang fiercely resented the Herdmaster 's splitting of the Year Zero Herd . He did not want to be here . The aft door cracked . Air hissed away . The bubbles grew taut . The door folded outward while the chamber filled with a thin singing : troposphere ripping at the digit ship . A line of bubbles streamed out , sixty-four fithp falling above the fluffy cloudscape . Another stream of bubbles followed them . ThenThe Octuple Leader was first in line , of course . Falling meant nothing to Chintithpit-mang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The survival bubbles dropped through the troposphere , slowing . The digit ship shrank to a dot . . . and presently began pulsing , accelerating , pushing itself back to orbit . The buffeting increased . Thicker air . The shape of the land was taking on detail . There , the crater that was both landmark and first strike ; beyond , the village that was their target . Chintithpit-mang watched the numbers dropping on his altimeter . Now . He opened the zipper . Air puffed away . He crawled out of the fabric and let it fall away into the wind . The land was yellow and brown , crossed by a white line of road , and now was a good time to learn if his ticxwing would open . It popped out by itself , and dragged at the air , unfolding as pressurized gas filled the struts . His senses spun as blood tried to settle into his feet.  |p168The  landing shoe on a hind foot had been jerked almost loose . He bent his head and stretched to adjust it ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toes : big , clumsy platforms of foamed material that would flatten on impact so that the bones of his feet would not likewise flatten . He looked for other flexwings . The colors of his Octuple were rose and black and green . He found six others and steered toward them . One missing . Where ? The land drifted . He steered above the road that the crater had broken , then along the road toward the city . Six flexwings moved into line behind him . Still one missing . And no way to avoid the ground now . The planet was all there was . Details expanded . Three dots scrambled from a tiny vehicle to lie by the side of the road . He steered toward them . They grew larger , LARGER ! Chintithpit-mang bellowed and pulled back in his harness to catch more air in his flexwing , increasing lift , striving desperately to avoid contact with the planet . The planet slammed against his feet . They stung . His landing shoes were smashed flat . He stripped them off , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were big . A line of insect-sized flyers converged toward the town ahead . Those were n't parachutes . " Delta wings , " Harry Red murmured . " Hang gliders . " The shapes hanging under the delta wings were not human . Harry ran to the bike and lifted the seat . The .45 Government Model felt comfortable in his hand , and the slide worked with a satisfying click , but the secure feeling the big pistol usually gave him was entirely lacking . A group of hang gliders broke away from the formation and came toward them . They split into two groups , one on either side of them . Melissa peered through the binoculars . " Elephants , " she said . " Baby ele-phants . " Jeri grabbed the glasses . Then she began to laugh . She handed the glasses to Harry . He said , " That funny , eh ? " and looked . Baby elephants with two trunks drifted out of the sky beneath paper airplanes . Harry chortled . They were wearing tall , conspicuous elevator shoes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs . Harry stopped laughing . Two lines of delta-wing gliders swept along a hundred yards to either side of them . They were sinking fast into the wheat fields . A much larger group had drifted over Logan . " Let 's get the hell out of here ! " I tarry shouted . I le raised the bike.  |p169It  would n't start . Laying it on its side in the dirt had n't been a good idea . The smell of gas was strong . The electric starter whirred again . The engine caught . Harry turned the bikeA delta-wing craft glided onto the road half a mile behind them . The Invader came down hard . It freed its weapon , then stepped out of the elevatorshoes . Other gliders settled to each side . A much larger vehicle swept overhead : a flat oval with upward-pointing fins . It glided along the road , settling slowly , until it landed more than a mile away . " We 're surrounded . " Jeri sounded tired , already defeated . " Let 's go , " Harry ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay low . Go on , now . " Jeri took Melissa 's hand and dragged her off into the wheat fields . They left an obvious trail behind them . The wheat stalks were thickly planted , and you could n't move through without knocking some of them down . We ca n't hide . Maybe they do n't want us . Harry took a fresh grip on the pistol and followed . Eight-cubed Leader Harpanet kept only the vaguest memories of his fall . Bubbles had streamed from digit ship Number Twenty-six into a dark blue sky and were instantly lost in immensity . Far , far below , a vast rippling white landscape waited for him . Voices chattered through a background of static ; voices called his name . He did n't answer . He might have spoken anytime during the years of preparation . He 'd heard lectures on planetary weather : the variations in temperature , " wind chill factor , " and the coriolis forces that cause air to whirl with force sufficient to tear dwellings apart : A vast worldwide storm , accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' messages tried to tell us . Random death in the life support system ! Harpanet had been in the Breaker group , trying to learn of the prey . They 'd watched broadcasts that leaked through the target world 's atmosphere . I ca n't make sense of these pictures . They do n't mean anything . The more he knew , the more alien they seemed . Breaker Takpusseh could live with his ignorance and wait to learn more . To Harpanet , these are not fithp at all . They build tools , and they kill , and we will never know more . Others of the spaceborn had had private interviews with Fistartehthuktun , and later been taken from the lists of Winterhome-bound soldiers . What they told the priest must have resembled his own thoughts : I ca n't stand it . The things who will try to kill me are the least of it . I fear the air and I fear the land , and I ca n't tolerate the thought of an ocean ! They were shunned thereafter . Their mothers never mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had kept his silence . He kept it now . 1 le could n't move , he could n't make a sound save for a thin keening like the keening of the air through which he fell . The thinp170skin of the bubble rippled under the atmosphere 's buffeting . The sky grew more inaccessible every second . He was late to open his bubble . The flexwing popped and the struts began to expand before it was clear . Harpanet shrieked . He was falling toward a rippling white landscape , vast in extent , and his collapsed bubble was still tangled around his flexwing . He clawed his way up the suspension harness and forced his digits under the fabric against the resistance of the inflated struts , and pulled . The planet 's white face came up to smash him . It was nothing . He fell through it without resistance . He was still clawing at the bubble fabric , and suddenly it was floating loose above him . He had to nerve himself to let go of the flexwing ; and only then did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was some time before he recovered enough to look for other flexwings . He found a swarm of midges far away . Away from the sun . It is late in the day . The planet turns away from the star . My warriors are spinward . The octuples under his command had steered toward their place on the rim of the great circle on the Herdmaster 's map . The circle would converge . Defenses would be erected . Digit ships would presently pick them up and return them to the darkness , the immensity , the security of space . A rise of land blocked his view of the other wings . Undulations of yellow fur streamed beneath him , terribly fast , and Harpanet had seconds in which to learn to fly . Through his terror came a single memory , that lifting the fore edge of the flexwing would cause him to slow and rise . He slid back in the harness . The wing rose , and slowed . . . and hovered , and dropped , and picked up speed , and hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled with him ; the flexwing wrapped around him ; one of the struts hissed in his face as his bayonet punctured it . When he finally managed to disentanglehimself , his radio was dead . One knee was twisted , so that he could walk on three legs only . Gravity pulled at him . It was an experience he would never want to remember . But he was sixty-fours of makasrupkithp to antispinward from his assigned landing point . Jenny woke with a start . A duty sergeant was standing over her . He chatteredexcitedly . " Right now , Major . The Admiral wants you in the war room now ; it 's an emergency . There 's an invasion . " Invasion ? She sat up . " All right , Sergeant . I 'm coming . " " Now , Major  --  " " I heard you . Thank you . " " Yes , ma'am . " She dressed quickly , putting on combat fatigues . He had n't said anything about sidearms . We 're at war , but surely they were n't invading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't so sure.  |p171Admiral  Carrell , still in civilian clothes , was in one of the balcony offices overlooking the control room . Jenny stood outside the door , wondering what to do . " Come in , Major . " Carrell pointed to the big screens below . They showed Kansas and southern Nebraska dotted with red flashes and handdrawngray squares . Jenny stared for a moment , trying to understand . " We do n't have symbols for a parachute invasion of Kansas , " Admiral Carrell said . " So we had to draw them in . Not that it means much , since we do n't know all the places they 're landing . " " Are all those red marks nuclear strikes ? " Jenny asked . " Probably none of them , " Carrell said . " So far they have n't used nukes . They have n't had to . " " No , sir . " Kinetic energy weapons . Throw big rocks . An Army lieutenant general bustled in . He wore combat fatigues and he 'd buckled on his pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " No ? General , Major Crichtonis my assistant . What 's the score , Harvey ? " " Damned if I know . Thor , this does n't make sense . They ca n't possibly be invading Kansas . I do n't care how goddam big that ship is ; it ca n't hold that many troops . " " Then what are they doing ? " General Toland shook his head . Carrell said , " Jenny , I want you to get those sci-fi gentry together and get them working . You can use the big briefing room . Get TV monitors set up , get maps , get coffee , get whiskey , hell , get them prostitutes if that 's what they want , but get me some explanations ! " Harry lay in the wheat field and sweated . There was a hot wind and bright sun , but he 'd have sweated in a blizzard . He could n't see the road , but he heard a vehicle on it . The motor did n't sound like anything Harry had ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone  --  something  --  was corning . The wheat was too thick to see through . His world had shrunk to five yards or less . He could just see Melissa 's bright head scarf . Should have told her to take it off . Too late now . Not that we can hide anyway . The sounds came closer . They were all around him . What the fuck do I do ? The pistol held no comfort for him . He was n't a good shot . He remembered a mere who 'd served in Africa telling him about elephants . They were hard to stop , harder to kill . You had to hit them just right . A .45 probably would n't even bother one , not unless he hit a vital spot  --   |p172They  are n't elephants . Maybe they 're not as tough . And maybe I do n't know where the vital spots are . He heard Jeri scream , and then two shots from her Walther . Melissa 's scarf bounced up , then something happened and she disappeared into the wheat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet and ran toward the sound . As he did , he heard something behind him . He turnedAn elephant was charging hint . Another closed in from the side . They were wearing hooded coats ! Harry held out the pistol and fired . The elephant kept coming . A flurry of whips lashed his arm and side , spinning him around , tearing the pistol from his hand . The other elephant came toward him . The trunk was built like a cat-o ' - nine- tails ; it held a bayoneted rifle . The bayonet was pointed at his throat . " Melissa ! Run ! " Jeri screamed . Harry turned to go to her . Something lashed around his ankles and whipped them away from him . He fell heavily into the wheat field . The elephant stood over him , bayonet pointed at him . The other came and stood with it . " Psh-thish-ftpph . " Harry glared up . The elephants repeated their phrase , only louder . " Okay , goddamm it , you got me ! " He stayed where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance and he'dOnce more the aliens shouted . Then suddenly the trunk swept down and rolled Harry onto his back . One Invader pulled Harry 's hands out over his head . The other reared above him . My God , they 're going to trample me ! Harry writhed to get away . The foot came down on his chest . It settled almost gently . Harry struggled : he yanked one hand free and scraped at the foot with his nails , tried to push it upward , tried to roll . The pressure increased . There were claws under his jaw , and a mass that was crushing his chest . The air sighed out of him in a despairing hiss . He blacked out . Fog in his mind ; memory of a nightmare . He was breathing like a bellows . Harry rolled over in . . . wheat ? Inhuman screaming and bellowing reached his ears , sounds like a fire in a zoo . Oh , God . Jeri ! Harry tried to stand up and made it to one knee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melissa on an Invader 's back , held firmly by a branching trunk . Jeri was walking , stumbling , with Invaders around her . A vehicle waited on the road , the size of a large truck , but it had nowheels . It looked like a huge sled . The motor was n't running . They loaded Melissa into the vehicle , then pushed Jeri in behind her . Others jumped onto the broad platform . The vehicle lifted on a cloud ofdust : an air cushion . It sped away.  |p173They  seemed to have forgotten Harry entirely . He crawled away slowly , disturbing the wheat as little as possible . What else could he do ? They 'd taken the big gun , but they might have left the motorcycle , and Carlotta still waited . Unless they 'd landed there too . By vehicle and on foot , the prey fled the village . Humans on foot were allowed to surrender . They had to be taught : in many cases they must be knocked down and rolled into position . Then , if they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were considered to be weapons and were treated as such . The village had suffered more damage than was needed . It grieved Chintithpit-mang : locals dead , or torn and still screaming , buildings smashed , the smell of explosives and of burning , the flattened crater where the rock came down . . . We 're dealing with unknowns . Better to err on the side of excessive strength . By asking those he passed , Chintithpit-mang found the leader of his eightcubedin a large red building with pillars in front . Siplisteph was surrounded by squarish bundles of printed sheets , bound at one edge and gaudily decorated . He was leafing through a bundle of print with drawings in it . The youthful sleeper seemed relaxed , very much at home . He looked up dreamily and said , " It 's so good to see a sky again . " His eyes focused on Chintithpit-mang . " You come late . " Chintithpit-mang said , " One never reported . Otherwise we have no cas-ualties . " Siplisteph lifted his digits in response . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your octuple , you will be deputy leader to your eight-squared . " " Were there heavy losses , eight-cubed Leader ? " " Many within the leadership . We have lost an eight-cubed leader . " " The leadership . They are all spaceborn  --  " " It would be well not to finish that thought , Chintithpit-mang . " Sleeper ! Winterhome is home to you , but how can we find ourselves within this infinite horizon , beneath this tremendous sky ? He could say none of that . " Lead me . " Continue your report . " " I obey . Eight-cubed Leader , I took two females . One was mated to a big male , the other their child . I took the male 's surrender and left him . " Siplisteph 's ears snapped alert . " The male surrendered ? " " He had to be shown . " But the episode had left a bad taste , and Chintithpit-mangwent on talking . " Eight-cubed Leader , I knocked him down and put my foot on him , lightly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped struggling . But when I took my foot away he did not move . I wonder if I simply killed him . "  | " This is the Breakers ' problem , not ours . " Siplisteph 's eyes returned to the pictures . " Lead me , " said Chintithpit-mang , and he went to rejoin his octuple . But it bothered him . By now the taking of Winterhome , in falling rocks and disrupted supply chains , must have killed close to eight to the sixth of the poor misshapen rogues . Well , that was what war was about . But a fi ' did not kill needlessly , did not kill when he could take surrender . If the beast was so fragile , why did it continue to fight ? Chintithpit-mang remembered its rib cage sagging under his foot . It thrashed and clawed and finally stopped moving . . . it did n't know how to surrender . They did n't know how to surrender . Bad.  |p175A  human being in a prison camp , in the hands of his enemies , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men together in the face of fear , hunger , and danger arc not natural . Stresses equal to , and beyond , the stress of fear and panic must be laid on men . Some of these stresses are called civilization . And even the highest of civilizations demands leadership.  --  T. R. FEHRENBACH , This Kind of WarCOUNTDOWN : H PLUS 80 HOURSThe hullside wall was down and level ; the door was in the ceiling . Wes judged that things were likely to remain so for some time . There had been an hour or so of acceleration , then half an hour of freefall ; then the ship had begun to spin . Some days had passed without further change . Odds were it would take an hour or more to remove the spin . Spin would hamper the mother ship in a battle . Earth must be far aft and out of reach . Nikolai and Dmitri talked quietly : Nikolai sullen , Dmitri doing most of the talking . Wes understood a few words , and sympathized . Nikolai was once again a cripple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching their language to the humans . Wes found this reassuring . However , the Soviets were educatedseparately , and they had expressed disinterest in sharing their lessons with Wes . He went over them alone , whispering alien sounds as he renicniberedthem . . Srupk : Wes had memorized the term as strunk , " standard trunklength . " It was just about six feet . A makasrupk was five hundred and twelve strunks , just about a kilometer . Wes had sought a word for the trunk . There was n't one . A sharp snort , , nn/p , named the nostrils , or the upper trunk . Pa ' was one branch , one finger of a trunk ; pathp , the plural , could mean the entire cluster . Chaytri/ meant /out.  |p176Sfaftiss  was Takpusseh 's title ; it meant teacher . The other sfaftiss did n't speak , and his name was harder : Raztupisp-minz . The two sfatissthp looked aged , but as if they had weathered in different patterns . Were there two races of Invader ? But they called themselves by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chtaptisk fithp meant themselves , everyone who had left their home planet . The Traveler People ? Fi ' was the word for an alien . A syllable chopped short by a kind of hiccup , it sounded like a piece of a word . And fithp was the entire species . As if an individual was not a whole , complete thing , just as a pa ' was only one branch of the pathp , the trunk . Herdbeasts ? Takpusseh said tribe , not herd ; but men did n't say herd to mean thinking beings . Tashayamp was Takpusseh 's assistant . Dawson thought of her as female : the leather or plastic patch on her harness covered a different area , further back on her torso . He knew he might have the sexes reversed ; he was not prepared to askThe door opened upward , a trapdoor . The prisoners looked up , waiting . Takpusseh : Wes had learned to recognize their teacher or trainer by the loose look of his thick skin , and by his eyes , which behaved as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien soldiers attached a platform at the level of the trapdoor . The platform descended smoothly along grooves in the padding of the starboard wall . The platform might have held one alien ; it held Wes and Arvid with room to spare . Wes had expected a ladder , but a ladder would be useless to these aliens . Takpusseh and Tashayamp and eight armed soldiers waited in the corridor . The platform descended again for Dmitri and Nikolai . They had left Giorge behind . Arvid had been hoping for a window . There were none . The soldiers moved four ahead , four behind . Takpusseh and Tashayamp moved forward to join the prisoners . They had found a wheeled cart for Nikolai . Arvid took charge of pushing it . Wes was trying to tell Tashayamp that they needed heat to prepare their food . Arvid ignored that . He was trying to get some idea of the mother ship 's layout . The rug was spongy and squishy-wet ; the prisoners had not been given shoes . Doors in the floor opened upward against the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian , " that any aperture big enough for one of the aliens would pass two or three of us at once . Perhaps they will not think to guard small openings that will pass a man . " Dmitri nodded . " They are surely not built for climbing . A wall that could be scaled by a man would be impossible for one of them . " Dmitri nodded again . " Have you seen anything I might have missed ? "  |p177Dmitri  spoke . " You waited until we were in a corridor , and moving , before you said any of this . I approve , but are you certain that our trainers do not speak Russian ? " " They speak English and do not hide the fact . Why would they hide a knowledge of Russian ? In any case , we must speak sometime . " " Perhaps . Do you think we could use their rifles ? " Grooves for the branched trunk were far forward on the barrel , and so was the trigger . The bore was huge . The butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit against a man 's shoulder , and it would probably kick him senseless , unless . . . you 'd have to brace it against something , a floor , a wall , a piece of furniture . Difficult to aim . " " Do n't do anything at all without word from me . What of Dawson ? Will he try something foolish ? " " I  --  " Arvid cut it off . They had reached their destination . The wide doorway would be used when the mother ship was under acceleration . The permanently fixed platform elevator next to it would be for use under spin gravity . The room below was big , and more than a dozen aliens were already present . The prisoners descended ; the soldiers remained above . The aliens stared up . Most of them had their trunks folded up against the top of the heads : evidently a resting position . The eyelids drooped mournfully . The eyes had black pupils fading to smoky-gray whites . They were set wide , but not too wide to prohibit binocular vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed grooves ; with the trunk up , the eyes focused along the grooves . . . like gunsights . Their stare was unnerving . Nikolai was wire-tense , staring his captors down . Arvid murmured , " Docile , Nikolai . We docile servants of the new regime await instructions . " Nikolai nodded . His eyes dropped . He sounded calm enough . " I saw no air vents . The air may be filtered through the carpeting . And the rug was wet . They like wet feet . " The room would have held three or four times as many . Takpusseh spoke rapidly to the assembled aliens , then more slowly to the humans . Arvid tried to file the introductions : Pastempeh-keph . K'turfookeph . Fathistehtulk . Chowpeentulk . Fistarteh-thuktun . Koolpooleh . Paykurtank . Two smaller aliens were not introduced . They stared at the humans and huddled close against larger aliens . Children , then . He 'd have trouble remembering the names . It was the array that was important . The aliens came in clusters ; he 'd be a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious . Pastempeh-keph ( male ) and K'turfookeph ( female ) , with their child ( male ) , were the top of the ladder , the Chairman or President or Admiral . The similarity in the last syllable meant they were mated ; he 'd learned that much already . One would hold title . Arvid would not lightly assume that it was the male . Similarly , Fathisteh-tulk and Chowpeentulk were mated ,  |p178and  they stood with the Admiral . Advisors ? The male was doing all the talking . So . Fistarteh-thuktun ( male ) , Koolpoolch ( male ) , and Paykurtank ( female ) also formed a cluster . The extra syllables would mean that Fistarteh-thuktun had a mate . He was an old one , with wrinkled skin and pained-looking eyes . . . like the teacher , Takpusseh . He wore elaborate harness , like tapestrymade with silver wire . He studied the humans like a judge . The pair with him were younger : clear eyes , smoother skin , quick movements . Nikolai said , " I thought the top ranks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpacks . The colors and patterns , could those  --  " " Yes , insignia of rank . Dawson believes that we will not sec clothing on any alien . With those bulky bodies they will have trouble shedding heat . " " I would not have thought of that . " The room darkened . One wall seemed to disappear , and Arvid realized that he was in a motion picture theater . Rogachev recognized the huge Invader spacecraft , a cylinder about as wide as it was tall . The aft rim was spiky with smaller craft , and some had not been moored in place yet . An arc of worldscape , blue and white , might have been the Earth , though Arvid could not pick out any detail of landscape . A polished sphere nearby . . . a moon ? No , it was drifting slowly . Takpusseh was talking . Arvid caught a word here and there , and translatedfreely to " Watch , do n't move . You see ... trip ( chtapt ) to ( Earth ? ) . Build . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that was their name for the mother ship , and sure enough , that was what they were putting together onscreen . He watched and did n't move . The aliens around him were silent , motionless . The last of the smaller craft were moved into place in seconds . This was time-lapse photography . A length of stovepipe , a little wider than Thuktun Flishithy , drifted in from the edge of the screen and was moored in place behind the ring of smaller craft . The shiny sphere was moved into place at the fore end of the mother ship . It was bigger than all of the rest of the ship combined . A pod , perhaps a cluster of sensing instruments , reached out on a snakelike arm to peer around it . Something fell inward from the edge of the picture : bright flames of chemical rockets around . . . something rectangular . It dwindled to a dot , headed straight for the ship . " Put Podo Thuktun in Thuktun Flishithy , " Takpusseh said . That word : thuktun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fistarteh-thuktun ? A mate for that one had not been named . Was that particularfi ' married to the ship ? All in good time . Arvid glanced at Dawson ; I ) awson 's eyes were riveted to the screen . That left Arvid free to covertly observe the aliens.  |p179Five  of the fithp showed signs of a lingering illness : an illness that left loose skin and wounded-looking eyes . It did n't seem to be a matter of age . Pastempeh-keph and K'turfookeph ( Admiral and mate ) were not youths , but they had n't had the sickness either . The sick ones tended to cluster . They looked to be about the same age ; the rest varied enormously . The Admiral 's advisor and his mate were among the sick ones . Another sick one was trying to talk to them , while a female rather unsubtly tried to prevent it . A division among the aliens might be useful . Wes Dawson was watching a planet recede . . . a world colored like Earth , blue with clotted white frosting . He spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shapes of continents . None were familiar . Of course not . The Invader ship had been on camera for only a minute or so . The camera that filmed that would have remained behind . But Thuktun Flishithy was more than the cylindrical warship that had reached Earth . A sphere rode the nose , a tremendous fragile-looking bubble in contrast to the warship 's spiky , armored look . Fuel supply , of course . And the ringHe was looking aft along Thuktun Flishithy 's flank , past a massive ring like a broad wedding band , watching a sun grow smaller . A second sun moved in from offscreen . Both shrank to bright stars : white stars , the light not too different from Earth 's own sun . He 'd anticipated that from the color of the lights in his cell . The cameras showed a steady white light behind the ring . Wes saw  --  and was n't sure he saw  --  the drive flame go dim , and a faint violet tinge emerge from the black background . Wes Dawson would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of his attention he tried to track what the instructor was saying . " Thuktun Flishithy must move very fast before we use the ( long . tht word ) . Saves  --  " something . " Halfway to Earth-star "  --  Earth 's sun ?  --  " webegin to slow down . This is difficult . " But the pictures made more sense than the words . ' I'itne onscreen speeded up . The drive flame brightened , then died  --  and the background violet glow he thought he 'd seen was n't there . Tiny malimesand mote-sized aliens emerged to dislodge the bubble at the nose ; the stars wheeled one hundred and eighty degrees around ; the drive flamed again , and dimmed , and the stars forward were embedded in violet-blacksohe had n't imagined it  --  and Thuktun Flishithy surged past the abandoned fuel tank and onward . The way the film jumped , a good deal of it must have been missing . Perhaps it would have shown too much interior detail . Wes took it for wanted that prisoners would not learn much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next scene was a time-lapse view of an ordinary star becomingp180a bright star , and brighter , until it virtually exploded in Dawson 's face . He cursed and covered his eyes , and immediately opened them again . They must have dived within the orbit of Mercury . Somewhere in there , the white glow of the drive had brightened . . . and the ship 's wedding band had vanished . Dawson had n't noticed just when it disappeared . Now he grunted as if he 'd been kicked in the stomach . Takpusseh stopped talking , and his eyes flicked Dawson with the impact of a glare . Nobody else noticed . The camera looked along the mother ship 's nose while Earth 's sun shrank . There were long-distance telescopic photos of Mars and Jupiter , then Saturn growing huge . The great ship moved among the moons , neared the rings , still decelerating . Wes picked out the three classic bands of the ring , separatinginto hundreds of bands as the ship neared . The F-ring roiled and twisted as the ship 's fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched aft along rails . The cameras did n't follow . A telescope picked out something butterfly fragile but not as pretty . Freeze-frame . Takpusseh pointed and made noises of interrogation . " Voyager , " Dawson said . He tried a few words of the Invader language . " We made it . My f the . United States of America ! " " Did it come to  --  " garble . The instructor tried again . " To look on us ? Did you know of us ? " The word must be spy . " No . " " Then why ? " " To see Saturn . " An anger was building in Wes Dawson , and he did n't understand it . They had come in war and killed without warning , but he 'd known that for days . What new grievanceThey had used Saturn ! Deep in his heart Dawson felt that Saturn belonged to Earth  --  to mankind  --  to the United States that had explored Saturn system , to the science establishment and science-fiction fandom . Goddammit , Saturn is ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jumped . They 'd skipped something : they 'd skipped most of what they were doing in Saturn system . Two crescents , Earth and Moon , were growing near . Wedge-shaped markers pointed out the United States and Soviet moon bases , artifacts in orbit , weather satellites , Soviet devices of unknown purpose , the space station . . . " Question , time you know we come , " Takpusseh said . Then louder : " Time you know we come ! " " One sixth part of a year , " Arvid said in English . " A year is  --  " llis hands moved , a forefinger circling a fist , while he spoke alien words : " Circle Earth around Earth-star . " " You slow to fight . You know we come . Why slow ? "  |p181Why  had Earth 's defenders responded so slowly ? Wes said , " Earth fithp , chtaptisk fithp maybe not fight . " " You fight , you not fight , two is one . Earth fithp is chtaptisk fithp . Sooner if Earth fithp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like this , he had put his fist into a Hell 's Angel 's mouth just as far as it would go . " You came to make war ? Only to make war ? " " Make war , yes , " Takpusseh said , as if relieved to be understood . Wes barely felt a large hand closing on his arm , above the elbow . " What can you take , move to fithp world ? " What could they possibly hope to steal ? They 'd dropped too much of their craft ; they 'd be : lucky to return home themselves ! " Earth is world for chtaptisk fithp , " Takpusseh said . Warriors had come at Takpusseh 's bellow . The humans were gone now . Fathisteh-tulk helped Takpusseh to his feet . " Are you injured ? " " My pride hurts worse than my eye  --  and snnfp . Dawson surprised me entirely . They look so fragile ! " " They do n't know when to fight and they do n't know how to surrender , " the Herdmaster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news for the invasion , but I wonder . " " Dawson is mad , " Breaker-One Raztupisp-minz said . " His behavior tells us nothing . Must we keep him ? " " He is a puzzle that needs cracking . He speaks English as his native language , and we will need that too until the others know the speech of the fithp a srupk or two better . " " They must surrender , at once , formally , " Raztupisp-minz stated . " We should have taught them how , and much earlier , so that they can teach future prisoners . " The memory flashed in Takpusseh 's mind ; it hurt worse than his eye . Ikpusseh realized why he had delayed this crucial step . " Of course you 're right , Breaker-One . I want to visit the medical section . I 'll meet you afterward , above the restraining cell . " It hurt to breathe , but he had to breathe . Hands were on him , probing a stabbing agony in his ribs . Wes gasped and fought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing . . . the shapes around him resolved into human faces . . . " What happened ? " " You attacked the teacher , Takpusseh . I tried to stop you , " Dmitri said . " Do you remember ? " Seeing red . . . but his mind must have been working well on some level . He had n't just swung a fist . 1 Ic 'd lunged forward and reached between thep182branches of Takpusseh 's trunk , closed his fingers hard in Takpusseh 's nostril , and pulled back savagely to keep himself moving . The teacher screamed ; his digits had whipped around Wes 's rib cage . With his ribs collapsing and the air sighing out of him , Wes Dawson reached along the trunk and slid his thumb under Takpusseh 's thick right eyelid  --  was he flying ?  --  and did his damnedest to twist it off . He did n't remember any more . " Why did you do it ? " " They never had the least intention of negotiating anything , " he said . " They came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grushin took Dawson 's chin in his hand and twisted it to put them eye to eye . " Do not attack them again . You would kill us all for nothing . For nothing . " They were quiet for some time . Then Arvid and Dmitri began to talk . Wes , with too little Russian , quickly lost track . He was more interested in the pictures in his own mind . Presently he asked , " Did you notice ? They threw away half their ship . " " Yes , " Arvid said . " The external fuel tank , and the massive-looking ring . " " I think it was a modified Bussard ramjet . " " Explain . " " It 's a way of reaching the stars . Fusion drive , but you get your fuel by scooping up interstellar hydrogen . " Arvid dismissed that . " Certainly nobody has ever built a Bussard rarnjet . How would you recognize one ? " " After they got going they changed something . It made a violet glow behind the ship . Arvid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got here . It was used to cross interstellar space , and they dropped it . They let it fall back toward the stars . They 're serious . They 've got no plans to go home . " " I was more interested in watching our captors . So . They dropped it to save weight , of course , but . . . well . As if your ancestors had burned the Mayflower . Yes , they came to stay . " Arvid 's eyes went to the trapdoor in the ceiling , which once again was closed against them . " Did you notice anything else worthy of comment ? " Wes pounded a fist on his knee , twice . " They were at Saturn when the Voyagers went by . They spent years there . We might have noticed somethingif Saturn was n't so weird . We 'd have had fifteen years warning ! " " It is difficult to put the mushroom cloud back into the steel casing . " " At least we know this is the mother ship . This is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightspeed ? " " They did n't even come very close . " Wes had been watching for the effect of relativity : stars blue-shifted ahead and reddened aft . It had n't happened.  | " Good . They can not expect help . But they must be desperate . Where can they go if we defeat them ? " " They 'll have to land sometime . They must expect to beat us on the ground . They 're crazy . " Arvid saw no reason to answer . Dawson was not of his nation . But any cosmonaut knew that from a military standpoint the command of space was priceless . The Soviet Union , which had always expected to rule the world , had held that position until three days ago . " Yeah . Well . They did n't show much of the inside of the ship . They showed only the last leg of their approach to Earth . They showed the mother ship being refueled , but they did n't show where the fuel came from . So maybe they scooped methane snow off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why did n't they show that ? They 're hiding some-thing . " " Of course . " " Something specific . " " Of course . " The trapdoor swung open . The platform descended into a wary silence . Takpusseh was quite alone . f lis right eye was covered with soft white cloth . Another patch covered his nostril . He carried his branched trunk at an odd angle . A second fi ' followed him down . The soldiers remained above . The Breakers faced the humans alone . The captives looked harmless enough . They were clustered in a corner , frightened , wary . The black one was on his back and trying to roll over . He seemed to be just becoming aware of the aliens . Raztupisp-minz told them , " Move away from the dark one . " The humans discussed it . Instant obedience would have been reassuring , but in fact they seemed to be interpreting for each other . Then they moved away . The black one protested and tried to move in the same direction. hen his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber had lost its air , his eyes and mouth opened improbably wide , as Raztupisp-minz walked toward him . Raztupisp-minz set his foot solidly on the black man 's chest . He lifted it and backed away . " You , " he said , and his digits indicated the crippled one . " Come . " The humans discussed it heatedly . Then Nikolai pulled himself across the floor on his hands . Dawson had moved , without permission . He knelt by the black man with his bony digits on the man 's throat . He spoke to the others , in English . " I cad . , , I'akpussch let it pass rather than interrupt the ceremony.  | " Roll , " Raztupisp-minz said , and he rotated his digits in a circle . Nikolai did n't appear to understand . Raztupisp-minz forcibly rolled the man onto his back , set his foot on the man 's chest , and stepped away . He pointed to another . " You . " One by one the Soviets submitted to the foot on the chest until only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raztupisp-minz stepped aside and Takpusseh came forward . The man stood balanced , forelegs slightly bent , hands open , palms outward . It came to Takpusseh that Dawson expected to die . It would n't bother Takpusseh that much if he did . He swung his digits with nearly his full strength . Dawson ducked under it , fast , and lunged forward . Takpusseh caught him on the backswing and flung him spinning across the cell and against a wall . As the man started to topple , Takpusseh was there , catching him and rolling him on his back . The man blinked , opened his eyes and mouth wide . Frozen in fear ? Takpusseh raised his foot over Dawson 's chest . I was almost the last to be thawed awake . Some of the sleepers were braindamaged . They fought , or they did n't respond at all . Most accepted the change . It was Breaker-One Raztupisp-minz who accepted their formal surrender . My grandson , though older than I , discounting the eights of years I slept . This was nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Nonetheless he was uncomfortable , because we are related , or because afterward I must teach him his profession . " Your position wo n't change , Grandfather . Who but you has the training to break alien forms of life to the Traveler Herd ? But the Traveler Herd has changed , and you must join it again . " I roll over on the floor , feet in the air , trunk splayed , vulnerable . Others watch . My spaceborn grandson 's foot on my chest . " There , that 's over . Now you must begin to train me , " his voice dropping , for my ears alone , " to break me . I must know something of what we must do . " I feel it now , the foot lightly crushing my chest . Takpusseh lowered his foot . A mere tap would not do ; this was no token surrender . He felt the man 's ribs sag before he lifted his foot . Dawson waited for more , but there was no more . He rolled aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now you belong to the Traveler Herd , " Takpusseh said in his own speech . He saw Dawson take it in and relax somewhat . Dawson moved to join the other prisoners . " Is the black one dead ? " Takpusseh asked . " What killed him ? " The one called Dmitri answered in the fithp speech . " Fear you . Fear foot make dead . Take him out ? " Takpusseh summoned the warriors . Two came down and moved the black man onto the platform . It rose . It descended to take the fithp up one by one . Takpusseh went last.  |p185Generally  in war the best policy is to take a state intact ; to ruin it is inferior to this . To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill . To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.  --  SUN-TZU , The Art of WarCOUNTDOWN : H PLUS 100 HOURSThe house had belonged to Carlotta 's grandmother . Trujillo had married ( ' astro had married de Alvarez , families whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Carlotta 's sister Juana had inheritedthe house . She married a man with the unlikely name of David Morgan . Of course Dawson was n't exactly in our conquistador heritage either . Carlotta i.iv in the exact center of the big four-poster and tried to count the spots on the ceiling . Thoughts came unbidden. tier superb imagination showed her a torn puffball of a corpse , dry and brittle , falling through vacuum and the savage sunlight of space . A dissectiontable with monstrous shapes around it . A carved corpse , the parts arrayed on a silver platter , surrounded by cooked plants of unearthly shape ; voices chittering or booming as the banquet began . No ! She leaped from the bed . The floor creaked as she scurried across the room to the door . The house was old , begun as a ranch house before the Civil War , added to as family required and money enabled . It had been built in clumps , and not all the additions fitted well together , although Carlotta rather liked the general effect . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an ancient housekeeper from Xuahaca who a ailed herself Lucy . Juana 's children had long moved away . And Sharon is in Peterborough , New Hampshire . Will I ever see her again. ? Than ! God the telephones worked lon , t , enough fir me to tell her to stay there . How could she travel ?  |p186Bright  sunlight flooded the hall outside her bedroom , and when she reached the kitchen the windup clock said it was mid-afternoon . Lucy had put away the gin bottle . Or did I finish it to get to sleep ? There should be some left in it . She went to the cabinet , but she felt Lucy 's disapproving stare . " Desayuno , senora ? " " Gracias , no . Por favor , solamente cafe . " And damned right I 'm going to sit on the patio in my housecoat . Who 's going to see me , or care if they do ? The patio was too large . When Carlotta had visited as a child , the gardens were famous through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes at county and state fairs . Now there was a big flagstone patio where the melon patch had been , and a field of sweet peas where celery and chard had grown . No gardeners . Plenty of people unemployed , but no one wants to raise vegetables for a retired professor and his wife . But it does make a nice patio . She sat at the big wrought-iron table . Lucy was setting the coffee down when the thunder began . Thunder from a clear sky was not unheard of in Kansas , but this did n't come in claps and die away . It rolled in and stayed , renewed itself , grew louder and faded and grew louder still . Then brilliant points were drawing straight white lines across the sky , sowing clouds of dots that drifted away to west and south . Lucy whimpered in terror , and the need to reassure the older woman kept Carlotta calm . Invasion . Parachutes . What came for Wes has come for me . But nothing showed directly overhead . Not here . Not yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her . " Yes , Juana ? " " What is happening ? " The noise had brought her sister outside . Juana Morgan held a small transistor radio that poured out static as she frantically turned the tuning knob this way and that . For once you will not look disapprovingly at me in my housecoat in mid-afternoon . " Vapor trails , I think . Perhaps the professor will know . " " He went to town to buy newspapers . " Juana paused . " And more gin . " " Ah . " Carlotta shrugged , and glanced significantly at Lucy . " They'renot coming here , " she said . " Miles away . Not to Dighton , either . " " Are you sure ? " Juana demanded . " Yes . " How the hell can I be sure ? And what could we do about it if they were coming here , or to Dighton ? It 's ten miles to Dighton , and David has the only damned car " David did n't think they 'd come , either , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mobilize . Maybe that 's where David is ! With the Guard . " " Could be . " What good is that ? Bunch of old men with worn-out equipment ... Wes always voted for bigger appropriations /inr the Guard , but nobody was really pushing it.  | " Lucy , perhaps it would be well to get out the candles and the storm lanterns , " Juana said . " SI . " Lucy shuffled away , still glancing up at the sky and looking away in fear . " Give her something to do and she bears up well , " Carlotta said . She stared at the open work of the tabletop . " I wish I had something to do . " " So do I. " Carlotta nodded . " Yeah . I would n't approve of me as a houseguest either . " " It 's as much your house as mine , " Juana said . " I have n't forgotten how much you and Wes loaned us . " She sat across from Carlotta . " Hell , get smashed every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the guy , did n't you ? " " Yes . Still do . " " Sorry " You do n't know he 's dead . " " No . " There was another peal of thunder . Juana shuddered . " I wish it had happened to me . " Carlotta frowned . " I mean , that it had been David up there . Instead of Wes . Damn . That sounds horrible . I mean  --  well , you 're really in love with Wes . It 's breaking you up . I 'd miss David ; we 're very comfortable together , but  --  well , I would n't be like you . I hate to see you like this , Carla . You were always the strong one  --  " " Yeah . I sure look it , do n't I. Oh damn , Juana , damn , damn , damn , what am I going to do ? " Juana looked up at the dot-filled skies and shuddered . The motorcycle was intact . Harry looked around furtively . No sign of the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . The saddlebags with his gear had vanished . They 'd taken them along with Jeri and MelissaGod damn the bastards ! Harry cursed steadily until he had control of himself . Then he felt ashamed . Cursing would n't change the situation . He 'd lost two women he was supposed to protect . The fact that he could n't have dome anything about it did n't help much . He felt a lump in his pocket . The little .25 Beretta was still there . They had n't bothered to search him . He thought about that for a moment , then began to search the wheat field . Sure enough , a blue-gray object was just visible in the wheat . The .45 automatic , with dirt in the barrel . One of the invaders must have flung it aside . Why the saddlebags , then ? Clothes ? Jeri 's and Melissa 's clothing . Which means they 'll be keeping the , tgirls . Why take them and not me ? But there was no answer to that.  |p188The  motorcycle started easily enough . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . The Invaders were still in Logan . Harry cleaned out the barrel while he felt something stir in his guts , but then he shook his head . It would be pointless . The Invaders wore body armor . His pistol had n't done him any good at all when there were only a few of them . Charging into Logan to rescue Jeri would n't do Jeri any good . She might not even be there any longer . He tried to remember the map . That part of Kansas was laid out in a grid , roads at section and range boundaries , other roads parallel to them . Few diagonal roads . Farmhouses at regular intervals . Dirt tracks crossed the wheat fields . Those tended to parallel the main roads , too , but they led to farmhouses , not towns . Logan was several miles ahead . Harry gambled that there 'd be a farm access road leading north before he came into sight of the Invaders . He put the pistol into his kidney belt where he could reach it easily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached the ruined farmhouse . He came up slowly , ready to leap off the motorcycle and run into the wheat . He stopped several times to listen , but there was nothing to hear . The dirt road led through the wheat fields to the farmhouse . He could go back the way he 'd come , or go on . He went on . The house itself was a wreck , roof sagging , doors torn from their hinges , but it had n't burned . The barn was burned to ashes . The bodies of a man and two dogs lay in the dusty yard between the house and the barn . A shotgun lay across the man 's chest . Another dog whimpered from under the wreckage of the farmhouse . " Ho ! Anyone home ? " Harry shouted . There was no answer except the whimpering of the dog . He stopped the motorcycle and got off . Large tracks were visible in the dust . They did n't really look like the tracks of elephants , because they left claw marks . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the yard , and after a while he went inside the house . There were women 's clothes in the closet with the farmer 's clothes . Another room had been occupied by a boy . Harry guessed he 'd been about Melissa 's age , ten or eleven . A model of the starship Enterprise hung from the ceiling and toy guns stood in the corner . Clothing for a small boy was flung onto the floor . Two dresser drawers were empty . Prisoners ? They 're taking women and children , but not men ? That does n't make sense . There were letters scattered across the front room floor . John Thomas Kensington , RFD #3 . . . Harry went back outside . Kensington lay on his back , his eyes staring upward to the sky . He 'd been torn in two halves by one shot . The bore on those alien guns was as big as a fist . Twenty yards from his body the ground had been torn up by something large thrashingp189in the dust , and there were dark stains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saluted and went back into the collapsing house . They take their dead with them . Dead or wounded . A shotgun ought to do some damage at that range . Wonder what he was using ? The refrigerator had been wrecked , but the food inside was n't spoiled . I tarry rooted around until he found bread and cheese and lunch meat and made a sandwich . While he was looking for bread he found a box of shells ' Or the shotgun . It was number six bird shot , suitable for doves and quail . Not much of a load for elephants . He waited until he 'd eaten before he went to take the gun from the man 's lifeless fingers . The dog under the porch continued to whimper . Bury the dead ? Shoot the dog before it turns feral or starves ? Harry had always believed himself tough , but he 'd never thought he 'd he faced with decisions like this . Dead bodies were matters for the police and the coroner 's office and the undertakers. ' ! ' here wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovel . I he made another dozen miles before the sonic boom tore at his ears . Harry braked the motorcycle and looked up . Three contrails led from the west , passing nearly overhead . Harry cheered . " Go get the bastards ! " he shouted . As he watched , one of the contrails broke into a ball of black smoke . Something bright seemed to stab upward from the east , and the second contrail died . The third traced a complex curve ; then it , too , ended in a ball of black smoke . " Damn . Damn and hell . " Harry started the bike again . The big situation map in the war room changed every few minutes , but no one was sure how current its information was . A vast area of Kansas , stretching northward into Nebraska , was covered with bright red symbols . Someone had finally got stylized parachutes to show where alien units had landed . They covered an area that looked much like an amoeba , with its nucleus at Great Bend . Pseudopods reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underground North American A o I ) efense complex . It was located under nearly a mile of granite , separated limn the outside world by scaled corridors , water barriers , guard rooms , and more granite . A row of offices overlooked the Situation Room . Jack Clyhaourne stood outside one of the office doors . Jenny came up to him and winked . He did n't respond . " I 'm supposed to report to Admiral Carrell , " Jenny said . Her voice held slight irritation . " Sure . " Jack shook his head . " Sorry , hon. I 'm about as useful as a fifth kg here . Where 's the President safer ? But I 'm the only Presidential ProtectiveUnit agent here , and I have to act like it . " " Yeah . Look , there 's no such thing as off duty down here , but we have to eat sometimes . Sleep , too ... Dinner tonight ? "  | " I 'd love that  --  " " I 'll be around . " She grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the screens . " " You 've got pictures of the aliens ? " " We think so . " Jenny tapped at the door . It was n't closed properly , and the door swung open . One wall of the office was glass . It overlooked the big screen displays and control consoles on the floor below . There was one desk . President David Coffey sat there staring at the maps . Admiral Carrell stood next to him . General Toland stood grimly on the other side of the desk from Carrell , his lips a tight line . " Roughly a circle , " Admiral Carrell said . " But what do they want ? " the President asked . " This is obviously a reconnaissance in force , " Carrell said . He shook his head . " As to what their ultimate aims might be , I do n't know , sir . " He looked up to see Jenny at the door . " Come in , Major . Have your intelligence people got the displays ready ? " " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one brought out . The pictures should be up from the lab any minute . " " Have you seen them ? " " No , sir , they 're color , and you do n't look at color while it 's being developed . " " But you have descriptions ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , tell us ! " the President demanded . " Mr. President  --  sir , it will only be another minute until the pictures are ready . I 'd  --  sir , I 'd rather you saw for yourself . " " Refugee reports , " General Toland said . " They 're letting people out , then ? " " Yes , sir , if they 're walking . No vehicles allowed out . Anyone who goes out is required to undergo a sort of ceremony . " " Ceremony ? " " Yes , sir . They  --  the science-fiction people say it 's reasonable , given the way the aliens look , but  --  " " Major , your air of mystery is rapidly becoming tiresome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Admiral lifted the phone . " Carrell . . . Yes , put the photographs up on the big screens . Let everyone see what we 're up against . " There were five screens . One by one they filled with pictures of baby elephants . Some hung from paper airplanes and wore elevator shoes . Others were on foot . All carried weirdly shaped rifles . Laughter sounded on the floor below , but it soon died away as the screen showed photographs of ruined buildings and wrecked cars , with alien shapes in the foreground . Bodies lay in the background of most of the pictures.  |p191Jenny  studied the photographs . They were quite good ; the photographer who 'd taken them said she 'd sold to Sports Illustrated and other major magazines . That 's the enemy . " They do look like elephants , " Admiral Carrell said . " Yes , sir , " Jenny said . " But they 're not really elephants . " " No . They 're invaders , " General Toland said . The President studied the screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What was it ? " " Before they 'll let anyone leave the area they control , they make you lie down on your back , arms stretched out overhead . Then one of thealiens  --  putshis foot on you . After that you 're free to go . " " And your sci-fi people think that 's reasonable ? " the President asked . " Yes , sir . The way the aliens are built , they must think in terms of tramplingtheir enemies beneath their feet . They may be the biggest animals on their planet . Most Earth species have a surrender ritual . This is theirs . " The President nodded slowly . God , he looks awful . I wonder if he got any sleep at all ? " Do your experts have any theories on what the invaders want ? " the President demanded . " ' The Earth , " Jenny said . General Toland was adamant . " Kick their butts , do n't piss on them , " he said . " Mr. President , we can not commit our forces piecemeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we go in there . " " American citizens are being killed there . Property destroyed . God damn it , they 've invaded the United States . " David Coffey 's voice was cold with anger . His hands gripped the arms of his chair . " We have to do something ! What 's the Army for if it ca n't defend the nation ? " Oland fought visibly to control himself . " ' That is hardly fair , Mr. President , " Admiral Carrell said . " The Army is not generally deployed to fight enemies within the nation . " " If they 'd let us call up some reservists before that goddam ship got here , " General Toland muttered . " Mr. President , I 'm doing all I can . Our best units arc in Europe and Central America and Lebanon , and there 's no chance we can get those troops home . Not while the enemy dominates space . They can see everything we do ! " See it and kill it , Jenny thought . Lasers for the airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when will we be able to do something for our people , General ToLind ? " the President demanded . " Two more days , sir . I hope . Mr. President , we ca n't mass our forces ! The commander at Fort Knox loaded tanks onto a train to send west . They lilt the train . " Their air defenses are superb . Anything we send into that area either gets zapped from space or hit by a ground-launched missile . " " Or worse , " Jenny said.  |p192They  all looked at her . " They 're setting up ground-based laser defense systems . The reports arc just coming in . I 'll have them on the screens in a few minutes . " " Lasers , " the President said . " Yes , sir . Much better than ours . " " So what the hell are they doing with them ? " General Toland demanded . Jenny shook her head . " We do n't know , sir . It appears they 're setting up a strong perimeter defense inside the area they control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get inside there to find out . " " So they have it all their way . " The President 's voice was low and tired , as if he 'd already been defeated . It frightened Jenny . " Not all their way , sir , " she said . " Some reports get out . Mostly ham radio . They do n't get to broadcast long before something smashes them . Also , there 's bound to be resistance . National Guardsmen . Farmers with deer rifles . " " Sure , they 'll fight , " Toland said . " Even without orders . " Jenny nodded . " But they 'll be disorganized . We ca n't communicate ! " " And there 's nothing else we can do ? " the President asked . There was despair in his voice . " With all our power , all our nuclear arsenal  --  ca n't we use nukes on them ? " " They 're all mixed in with our people , " Admiral Carrell said . " General , do something . Hurt them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't there any place where there are a lot of them , and none of our people ? " " None , no . Not many , yes , " Toland said . The President stared grimly at the screens . " Hurt them . Now . It will help American morale . " " But , sir  --  " " That was an order , General . " Toland snapped to attention . " Yes , sir . I take it you do n't want a general bombardment . " " No . But they ca n't have it all their way . We have to hurt them . How else will we drive them out of America ? " Why are we so sure we can do it ? Jenny almost blurted it out . " We may not be able to drive them out , " Admiral Carrell said . " We may simply have to kill them all . " " It may come to that , " General Toland said . " It comes under the heading of destroying the country in order to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would they do ? " " They kill without destroying the cities . " General Toland drummed his fingers against the glass wall of the office . " If our people are inside , behind stone walls , in basements  --  do n't most Kansans have root cellars ? Places underground ? " " Many do , " the President said.  | " A few feet of dirt would protect our people , " Toland said . " If the elephantsare out in the open , we could zap them without destroying Kansas . Only trouble is , we do n't have the bombs . " " Why not ? " " The few we have are in Europe , " Admiral Carrell said carefully . " Becauseof public protest , we were never allowed to manufacture any large number of neutron weapons . I have asked the laboratories at Sandia and Los Alamos to try to assemble makeshift enhanced radiation weapons , but they can not give us a schedule for their delivery . " " But this is insane , " the President said . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We do n't know , " Jenny admitted . " Certainly fewer than fifty thou-sand . " " Even so , it must be a significant part of their ground combat strength , " ( ; eneral Toland said . " More troops than they can afford to lose . If we kill diem all , they may have to leave us alone in future . " " They still control space , " Admiral Carrell said . " Major Crichton , you look like a lady who wants to say something . " " Yes , sir , " Jenny answered . " You asked me to get the science-fiction people to work . It was n't hard . They 've got a number of ideas about the war . " " Well ? " the President demanded . " Sir , I think it would be better if you heard for yourself . " David Coffey frowned . Then suddenly he grinned . " Sure , why not ? As you say , they 're the only experts we have . " When night came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , Carlotta thought . Only two inches in this bottle . She 'd found blackberry wine in the root cellar . It would have to do . They sat by candlelight in the living room . There were distant soundsof thunder , and far to the east and south were flashes of light . The skies were clear overhead . Juana sat next to a kerosene lamp with aJane Austen novel . " Are n't you worried ? " Carlotta asked . " Sure , but what good does that do ? David 's got a good car and a rifle . He ca n't phone . What should I do ? " " I do n't know . What about  --  " She paused , and after a moment there were more distant sounds . " About that ? " " Nothing we can do . Should we run away ? Where would we go ? It 's miles to the nearest house , and Lucy ca n't walk that far . " " Do n't you have another car ? " " Not one that works . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know . Want some wine ? " " No. "  |p194And  you do n't think I should , either . To hell with you . Carlotta drank the blackberry wine . It was much too sweet . Morning came , bright and clear and cloudless , a glorious Kansas day except for ominous black clouds rising far away in the east . There was still no sign of Professor Morgan . Carlotta and Juana sat outside on the patio with coffee . The night sounds were gone . An hour passed , then part of another ; then there were noises , and dust to the west . " Cars . Trucks . Lots of them , " Juana said . She listened again . " Sound strange . Now maybe is a good time to run . " What 's the difference ? " Carlotta asked . Maybe they 'll know something about Wes ! Juana peered down the road . " It 's the army ! " she shouted . " Our army ! " Carlotta was almost disappointed . She counted a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the drive and circled on both sides of the house , going right on past and out toward the abandoned barn . One vehicle that looked like a tank , but had wheels , drove up to the house and stopped . An elderly officer with a graying mustache got out . " Joe ! " Juana called . He saluted . " Lieutenant Colonel Halverson , Kansas Militia , ma'am . " He tried to grin . " Come to see if you need help . " " Have you seen David ? " Juana demanded . " Yes , ma'am , Major Morgan will be along in a bit . He helped us round up troops . Thought he ought to come home last night and tell you , but he said you 'd understand , and we sure did need him , him and that four-wheel of his . " " What do you intend , Colonel ? " Carlotta asked . She remembered she was dressed in a wrinkled housecoat , and was ashamed . " This is my sister , " Juana said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet you , ma'am . " He climbed down off the armored car . " As to what we intend , well , first I 'm waiting for my helicopters . Takes time to get them spruced up . Meantime , we came out to see if you needed help . When the choppers get here , we 're going south and east until we see what the hell has invaded us . " Carlotta nodded . A dozen tanks , two of those armored car things , trucks . And helicopters . Weekend warriors . Most of them are pretty old , but  --  " You look formidable enough . Fast work . " " Started mobilizing the Guard the night they started shooting , " Halversonsaid . There was pride in his voice . " Been rounding up troops from all over the county . Would have called Major Morgan , but the phones were out . Lucky we ran into him in town . " " But what is happening ? " Halverson shrugged . " Juana , we have n't been in touch with any governmentabove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIVEN &; JERRY POURNELLE 195do n't work , nothing but static on the radios . Most of our communications stuff was designed to work with satellites , and we sure as hell do n't have any of those left . Even so  --  " His back straightened . " I do n't figure Washingtonwants me to just sit back and wait for orders , not while they 're dropping out of the skies ! Soon as my choppers get here , we 're going to show ' em what it means to mess around with Americans . Especially Kansas Jayhawks ! "  |p196A  general never knows anything with certainty , never sees his enemy plainly , nor knows positively where he is . The most experienced eye can not be certain whether it sees the whole of the enemy 's army , or only three-fourths of it . It is by the eyes of the mind , by the combination of all reasoning , by a sort of inspiration , that the general sees , commands and judges.  --  NAPOLEON BONAPARTE , MemoirsCOUNTDOWN : H PLUS 120 HOURSHarry spent the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more of it piled on top to stay warm . He did n't dare risk a fire . There were flashes and thunder all around him . By counting time between flash and sound , he estimated some were as close as three miles , far too close . Morning came , and he missed Jeri 's camp stove and cocoa . Ca n't think about that . Got to get moving . But goddammit , I should have done something ; I should have saved her . Hell , I should have left her by her car  --  she 'd have been safer ! Come with me . I 'll take care of you , shitThe motorcycle ran fine . He estimated that he had another twenty miles to go , and fuel for thirty . Harry turned up the lane toward the big house and shook his head in disbelief . Made it , by God ! At least it certainly looked like the place Wes had once described , and it was on the right road , ten miles west of Dighton , and there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The skies were blue and clear , and there were only occasional thunderclaps and flashes of colored light . He frowned . An army Light Armored Vehicle stood in front of the house . There were deep tread marks on both sides of the drive , leading out behind the house . Half a mile out through the fields were at least six tanks , a couple of obsolete M-1 Abrams tanks and at least two Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.  |p197A  big blue GM Jimmy four-wheel-drive truck stood in the driveway beside the LAV . Harry nodded at it approvingly . He let the motorcycle coast up to the front porch . Two soldiers older than Harry sat on top of the armored car . One waved at Harry . " Hi , " Harry called . " Hi , " one of the soldiers answered . Something moved behind the glass-paneled front window . " Is Mrs. Dawson at home ? " Harry asked . No point in asking why the army had surrounded the house . " Think so , " a sergeant said . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened . Carlotta Dawson , in blue jeans , her hair bundledinto a kerchief , rushed down the steps . She did n't say anything . She justgrabbed Harry and pulled herself against him , burying her face in his beard . She stood that way for a moment , then looked up at the soldiers on theLAV . " He came all the way from L.A. , " she said . " To help me . " " Tough going ? " the sergeant asked . " Some , " Harry said . " Heard it was bad out west . " " Hoover Dam 's gone , " Harry said . " They took out all the cities along the Colorado River . Same thing happened with all the dams along the Platte . They seem to like hitting dams . " An officer came out of the house . " Colonel Halverson , this is Harry Rcddington , " Carlotta said . " A friend of  --  of Wes and me . He 's come from l .. A. Harry , you must be starved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to move . The damned elephants  --  " " Elephants ? " Colonel Halverson demanded . " Elephants ? " " Yes , sir , " Harry said . " The invaders  --  " " Why do you say elephants ? " " They look like baby elephants with two trunks . " " You 've seen them , then ? " " Yes , sir , I sure have . " Harry winced . This was n't going to be easy . Why tell it at all ? " Shot one , too , but they wear armor , so I doubt if I hurt it . " " Armor ? " " Yeah . Body armor , and they have rifles . They kill people . They kidnapped  --  theytook some people prisoner from a farmhouse . Killed the farmer . " " Just how close did you get to them ? " Harry shuddered . " Too damn close ! Close as you and me ! " One stood on my rleest  --  He would n't say that . It shamed him . Halverson looked skeptical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They let me go . Look , you guys do what you want , but Mrs. Dawsonand Inc have to get out of here . They 're all around , it 's damned lucky theydid n't get here yet . " " Fell inc more , " Colonel Halverson said . " Tell me everything . "  | " There 's just not that much , " Harry said . They wore elevator shoes and they came down on paper airplanes . If I say that  --  " They came down on hang gliders . Then bigger stuff landed . " " How big ? Where ? " " Near Logan . They had flying things about as big as a jetliner only not so wide in the wings . And a floating thing about as big as a diesel semi . That 's what I saw . There may have been bigger . " " Tanks ? Field guns ? " " None I saw . " " And they let you go ? " " Yeah , sort of . " " They let others go ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Halverson pounded his right fist into his left hand . " But we know they 're east of us , and nobody 's come out of there . They would , too , if the  --  if those things would let them . Maybe there 's something they want to hide . Son , you better tell me everything you know . " Gradually Halverson dragged the story out of Harry . Finally it was done . " So I found the gun , " Harry said . " I thought about going after Mrs. Wilson , but I came here , instead . " Halverson looked thoughtful . " Hell , what else could you do ? You 're no army . The next time they 'd just shoot you . But I sure wish I knew what they 're hiding out to the cast  --  " " Colonel ? " The sergeant seated on top of the armored car jumped off . He looked older than Halverson . " Yeah , Luke ? " " Colonel , I heard a funny story last night . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from here ! What were you doing in Col-linston ? " " Took some of the boys over for a drink . You did n't need us . We were n't going anywhere . " " Next time you leave camp , you tell me . " He chuckled . " Okay , so you found a bar open in Collinston . Guess it takes more than war and a parachute invasion to close the bars in that town . " " Sure does . Anyway , there was a guy in the bar . He 'd been drinking a lot , so nobody paid much attention . He said he 'd seen an elephant . A little one . In a willow patch outside of town . Thought it escaped from some circus , because it was a trained elephant . " " Trained ? Trained how ? " Halverson demanded . " Do n't know . " " Harry . " Carlotta 's voice was low and urgent . " Harry , that 's an invader . We have to go capture it . We have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have to ! " Harry gulped hard . " Sure , but I need gas  --  "  | " I 'll get it out of David 's car . " " Hey , hold on , " Colonel Halverson said . " I ca n't let you do that  --  " " Why not ? " Carlotta demanded . " You 're going east . You 'll see lots of invaders . You do n't need this one . " " But  --  look , those things are armed  --  " " It did n't hurt that man in the bar , " Carlotta said . " Why would he think it was trained ? Maybe  --  maybe it lay down and rolled over ! " " Holy shit ! " Harry said . " Hey , she might be right . " " Yeah , but  --  " " Colonel , my husband was a personal friend of the President . President Coffey himself sent Wes up to meet the aliens . It 's my right to find out what happened to him . You give Harry some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will do the rest . " Yeah , Harry thought . Sure . " I say we go in after them . " Evan Lewis sounded very sure . " Hell , Joe , we have to ! We ca n't let those  --  things run all over Kansas . " " Was n't me arguing with you , Captain , " Lieutenant Colonel Halverson said . He looked at the others seated at Juana Morgan 's dining room table . Evan Lewis , who ran a tractor sales and repair agency , and commanded the tanks . George Mason , lawyer , who commanded the six helicopter gunships . The fourth man at the table was David Morgan , retired professor of business administration , Halverson 's adjutant and chief of staff . Morgan was the smallest one at the table , and he spoke with a clipped eastern accent that irritated hell out of Joe Halverson , but he was certainly the smartest man in the battalion . " And I still do n't like it , " George Mason said . " Colonel , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what the Army has in mind . " " So what do you suggest we do ? " Halverson asked . " Wait for orders . " " How heroic , " Captain Lewis said . " Enough . " David Morgan spoke quietly , but they all heard him . " We do n't need bickering . " " So which side are you on , Professor ? " Evan Lewis had never liked Professor Morgan . On the other hand , it was David Morgan 's house , and they all felt like guests , military uniforms or not . " I agree with Colonel Halverson 's reasoning , " Morgan said . " The invadersare hiding something to the east . We 're a cavalry outfit . It 's our duty to explore  --  but carefully . In particular , we have to be certain that any uilormation we get will be useful . That wo n't be easy . They 're jamming communications and the phones do n't work . " Joe I lalverson nodded thoughtfully . " Suggestions , Major ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley vehicles as communicationslinks . " Ile sketched rapidly on the table cloth . " Corporalp200Lewis "  --  Morgan nodded to Evan Lewis ; everyone knew that Evan 's son Jimmy was an electronic genius  --  " Jimmy rigged up those shield things that let the tanks talk to each other , as long as the antennas are aimed straight at each other . Fine . We send the choppers forward as scouts and flankers , making sure they stay in line of sight to the tanks . Tanks in the middle , concentrated enough to have some firepower , spread out enough to not make such a good target . Then string the Bradleys and the LAVs out behind as connecting links . " " What do they connect to ? " Mason asked . " We leave two troopers here with my wife and a radio . Juana writes down everything . If we do n't come back , she gets the hell out . " " Not much chance she 'd have to do that , " Halverson said . " Hell , we 're not an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " He looked out the window at his command . Six helicopters , with missiles . A dozen tanks , with guns and missiles . The communications were n't any good because the Invaders were broadcasting static from space . But even without communicationsa troop of armored cavalry was nothing to laugh at . " Sounds all right to me , " Lewis said . " At least we 'll be doing some-thing . " " I 'd rather wait for orders , " George Mason said . " But what the hell , I 'm ready if you are . " Joe Halverson stood . " Right . Let 's go . " " I 'm Jimmy Lewis , " the corporal said . He climbed through the attic window to join Harry on the roof of the big frame house . Harry nodded greeting . " Hi . They tell me you invented this . " He hefted the handi-talkie radio whose antenna was wrapped in a tinfoil cone stiffened with coat-hanger wire . " Yeah , " Jimmy Lewis said . His tone was serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications . You have to point it pretty tight , though , or you 'll lose the signal . " Harry regarded the device , then the similar but larger tinfoil monstrosity on one of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles in the yard down below . " Yeah . So I point this at the Bradley , and maybe I can hear . What then ? " " Use this , " Jimmy Lewis said . He handed Harry a Sony tape recorder . " There 's three hours of tape on there . More than enough . Just plug it into the radio , here , like that , and turn it on when we move out . Listen in the earphones , and you 'll hear a tone if you 're pointed close to the tank , and nothing at all when you 're dead on , except when they 're talking ; then you 'll hear them talk , of course . It sounds hard , but it 's pretty easy , really . " " Sure . " Major Morgan was in the front yard . Harry could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like it . Their housekeeper sat in the frontp201seat of the four-wheel-drive Jimmy , but Juana Morgan did n't want to drive it . Finally , though , she got in , and the blue Jimmy drove off . And now it 's just Carlotta and me . David Morgan stood very straight as he went to his tank and climbed in . Colonel Halverson came over to stand below them . " ' Bout time , Jimmy , " he shouted up at them . " Yes , sir . " Corporal Lewis waved to Harry and crawled back inside through the window . " Thanks , Mr. Reddington , " Halverson shouted . " I need all my troopers . Good of you to fill in . I doubt you 'll be needed , but  --  " " Yeah . No problem , Colonel . " Of course Carlotta 's goin ' nuts , wanting to go get that elephant . Maybe it 's safer up here ! " Thanks , then , " Halverson said . He walked briskly up the line to the lead tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then waved dramatically . " Wagons  --  h0000 ! " he shouted . The helicopters rose in a cloud of dust and swept forward and off to each side in groups of three . The tanks fanned out and moved ahead , leaving the Bradleys behind . " Watcher , this is Jayhawk One . Do you read ? " Harry keyed the mike . " Roger , Jayhawk One , this is Watcher . " " Course is 100 degrees , moving forward at 1220 hours , " the tanker 's voice said in Harry 's ear . Harry started guiltily and switched on the tape recorder . When the Bradley began to move eastward , it was much harder to keep the radio aimed properly . Harry braced it against the chimney . The rooftop was steep and it was n't easy to keep his footing . The helicopters wove in complex patterns ahead of the tanks . " Moving ahead at twenty klicks , " the voice said . About ten miles an hour , Harry thought . He could still remember kilometer signs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A half-hour went by . The helicopters and lead tanks were nearly invisible . The others were strung out behind them . Harry 's radio contact was a good five miles ahead , and it took all his attention to keep the antenna aimed properly . He was about to key the mike to tell them that . " Light overhead , " the tanker 's voice shouted . I tarry could see it . A bright green flash , more visible high up than near the ground . " It 's moving in a circle  --  Number Three Helicopter reports the beam is moving around them in a circle , it 's tightening in on them  --  " There was a pause . " No contact with the choppers . Colonel Halverson reports they 've been attacked by some kind of beam  --  " lows . " So tar nothing 's shot at us  --  "  |p202There  was a roar and the sharp snap of multiple sonic booms . Harry looked up . Dozens of parallel white lines crossed the sky from the southwest . They dropped like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's force was centered . There were bright flashes at the horizon and along the line where the connecting vehicles had been strung out . After a long pause , there was the sound of thunder . " Jayhawks , this is Watcher , " Harry said . " Any Jayhawk , this is Watcher . Come in  --  " Harry poured the last of the gas into the motorcycle . " What was it ? " Carlotta asked . " I do n't know . It looked like a video game . It was unreal . " Harry went on checking the motorcycle . Making a motorcycle work was a good test of sanity , and one he could win . Death from the sky  --  We owned the sky once . Then the Soviets took it away . Now we 've got to take it back from baby elephants . " Motor 's in good shape . We 'll make it fine . You 'll have to hold the rifle . " He handed Carlotta the 30-06 Winchester that David Morgan had loaned him . " Not an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morgan had said . Not a loan anymore . They were dead , all of them . He 'd waited an hour . " Maybe I ought to go look ? " " No . " Carlotta was positive . " You 'll get yourself killed . It 's more importantthat we capture that stray " Mrs. Dawson , you do n't know that 's a stray . " " What else could it be ? " Harry shrugged . All I know is I 'm gettin ' damned tired of ridin ' this motorcycle , and I wish I had another tube of Preparation H. But my back is n't as bad as it was . " All aboard . " He patted his pocket to be sure the tape was in it . Somebody would want that tape . " I will never go metric  --  " Harry sang . A clump of cars and people was clustered around a big semi ahead . " We 're just about to Collinston , " Harry shouted . " That looks like trouble . " He slowed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol cruiser was parked nearby , and a lieutenant of the highway patrol stood facing a knot of angry farmers and truckers . Most of them held rifles or shotguns . " Oh , shit , " Harry muttered . The lieutenant eyed Harry and Carlotta . Red beard , dirty clothes ; middleagedwoman in designer jeans . He watched Carlotta dismount . " Yes , madam ? "  | " I am Carlotta Dawson . Yes , Dawson . My husband was aboard the Soviet Kosmograd . Lieutenant , I gather there is an alien here ? " " Damn straight , " one of the truck drivers shouted . " Goddam snout blew George Mathers in hale . " He brandished a military rifle . " Now it 's our turn ! " " We have to take it alive , " Carlotta stated . " Bullshit ! " This one was a farmer . " I come out of Logan , lady . The goddam snouts killed my sister ! They 're all over the fucking place . " " How 'd you get out ? Foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepish . " Thought so , " Harry said . " Look , give us a chance . The military wants to question that thing . We 'll go in after it . " He pointed to the willow trees a hundred yards from the highway . " Over there , right ? " " Over there and go to hell , " someone yelled . " Let 's go , " Harry said . He gestured to Carlotta . She climbed on behind . " In there . " " There " was a dirt path leading to the clump of willow trees . As Harry started the motorcycle , he heard one of the truck drivers . " We can blow it away when he gets out . " There were mutters of approval . When he stopped at the swamp 's edge , he could hear something big in the creek .

Try again ? The man scampers into the cab , emerges with something that flames and roars . Harpanet rolls in time to take the cloud of tiny projectiles in his flank instead of his belly . I'hc man fires again . He has refused surrender . Harpanet trumpets : rage , woe , betrayal . He sweeps up his own weapon and fires back . The enemy 's forelimbs and head explode outward from a mist of blood . In Harpanct 's mind his past fades , his future is unreal . His digits stroke his side , feeling for the deathwound .

Green . . . tall green plants with leaves like knife blades , but they brush away the hungry swarming dots ... water ? Mud ! He rolls through mud and greenery , over and over , freezing from time to time to look , smell , listen . Harpanet 's past fades against the strange and terrible reality . If he has a future , it is beyond imagining , a mist-gray wall . There is only now , a moment of alien plants and fiery itch and cool mud , and here , mudroom and garden mushed together , nightmarishly changed . He rolls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread across his tattered flank . Afraid to leave , afraid to stay . What might taste his blood in the water , and seek its source ? The predators of the Homeworld were pictures on a thuktun , ghosts on an old recording tape , but fearsome enough for all their distance . What lurks in these alien waters ? But he hears the distant sound of machines passing , and knows that they are not fithp machines . A machine comes near , louder , louder . Harpanet 's ears and eyes project above the water . The machine balances crazily on two wheels , like men . It slows , wobbles , stops . Humans approach on foot . Harpanet 's muscles know what to do when he is hurt , exhausted , friendless , desperate , alone . Harpanet 's mind finds no other answer . But he sees no futureHe lurches from the water . Alien weapons come to bear . He casts his gun into the weeds . He rolls on his back and splays his limbs and waits . The man comes at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance so . The man sets a hind foot on Harpanet 's chest , with such force that Harpanet can feel it . He swallows the urge to laugh , but such a weight could hardly bend a rib . Nonetheless he lies with limbs splayed , giving his surrender . The man looks down at his captive , breathing as if he has won a race .. . " We got him ! " Harry shouted . " Now what ? " He waved uphill , where a score of armed men , hidden , waited with weapons ready . " I can talk to them  --  " Carlotta sounded doubtful . " They wo n't listen . " And dammit , this is my snout , they ca n't kill it now . Harry thought furiously . A guilty grin came , and he lifted the seat of the motorcycle , where he kept his essential tools . " You 've thought of something ? " " Maybe . " He dug into the tool roll and found a hank of parachute cord . It was thin , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those . He gestured to the captive , using both hands to make " get up " motions.  |p205The  alien stood . It looked at them passively . " Gives me the creeps , " Harry said . He clutched his rifle . One 30-06 in the eye , and we do n't have a problem . " See if it 'll carry you , " Harry said . " Carry me ? " " Sheena , Queen of the Jungle . I know they 're strong enough . " A dozen truckers and farmers stood with ready weapons . Harry walked ahead of the invader , leading it on a length of cord . Carlottarode its back , sidesaddle . She beamed at them . " Hi ! " she called . None of the watchers spoke . Perhaps they were afraid of saying somethingfoolish " It surrendered , " Carlotta shouted . " We 'll take it to the government . " There was a loud click as a safety was taken off . Harry whistled : Wheep , wheep , wheep ! " Here , Shep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shcp big gray peanut-loving doggie !

There mark what ills the scholar 's life assail  --  Toil , envy , want , the patron , and the jail.  --  DR . SAMUEL JOHNSON , Vanity of HumanWishesCOUNTDOWN : H PLUS 150 HOURSPavel Aleksandrovich Bondarev fingered the priceless tapestry covering the bare concrete wall . " It does n't really look like a bomb shelter , " he said . Lorena rolled lazily in the big bed . " They are very nice rooms , " she said . Her own room was just down the corridor , close enough that only a few of Bondarev 's staff knew just how late she stayed . They would n't talk . As secretary to the acting commander of the Soviet space defense forces , Lorena was one of the most powerful women in the Soviet Union . As long as my wife is not offended . She must know , but so long as I am discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closet , where his uniforms hung . She fingered the shoulder straps on one of them . " I had never thought to see you a general , " she said . " And now there is talk of making you a Marshal of the Soviet Union  --  " " Hah . " " You do not wish promotion ? " " Of course not . I never wanted to be part of the military at all . I would rather talk with the aliens than fight them ! They were in space for decades , out between the stars where there is no interference , no radio noise  --  think of what they must have learned ! " " They have destroyed half of Russia , and you wish to talk to them ! " He sighed . " I know it is impossible . Perhaps , though , when we defeat them , I will learn what they know of stars . " Only it is not so certain that we can defeat them . Whenever we launch a missile , they destroy the missile base.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured aliens . " " Perhaps . " " And perhaps not . It is late . " She moved provocatively . He did n't react . " So . You are satisfied for the moment , " she teased . " Perhaps later  --  " " I have other things to concern me , " Bondarev said . Lorcna laughed . " They do not always keep your attention  --  " A chirp sounded from the other room . Bondarev put on a robe . He could not cut short a conversation with whoever called on that phone . " Bondarev here , " he said . " Narovchatov . " " Da , Comrade Narovchatov ? " " I am told that the Americans have called you . " " Only to test the telephone line . I did not myself speak to them . " " Who did ? " " My secretary . " " What was said ? " " Nothing , Nikolai Nikolayevich . Comrade Polinova spoke to an Americantechnician . She was told that the Americans wished to speak with me , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have reported this ? But there was nothing to report . " It is a matter of great concern , " Narovchatov said . " We have been unable to make contact with the Americans . The Chairman wishes to speak with the American President . Are your technicians working on reestablishing this connection ? " " The failure was not here , Comrade Narovchatov . I understand that the cable crosses the Atlantic , then passes under the Mediterranean , and comes through Istanbul . I believe the break was in Marrakech . " " Where there is chaos , " Narovchatov muttered . " Da . " Bondarev had sporadic communications with a large Soviet armoredforce in Africa , but that group was far to the south and cast of Marrakech . Lorena came in with a glass of hot tea and set it beside him . Bondarev nodded his thanks . " Perhaps the KGB has agents in Marrakech , " Bondarev said . " Perhaps they could facilitate the repair of the cable . " " A splendid suggestion . I will send the orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest in Germany and Poland . We have reason to believe the West Germans may attempt something . The Americans must restrain them . " If they can . And if they will . " Da . I understand . " " Have you anything to report ? " " Only rumors . Our station in Tehran confirms that the Invaders have landed iii the central United States , and there is land warfare . The Americans in Tehran know little else , but they pretend high confidence . "  | " You will call if you learn more , or if you make contact with the Amer-icans . " " At once . " " Your wife sends her regards , " Narovchatov said . " She is well and your children are well . " " Thank you . " The connection broke . Bondarev sipped his tea . " My family is well , " he said musingly . " But they did not say where . " " No . With the Chairman and the Politburo . Somewhere near Moscow , I would presume . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am glad they are safe . I am also glad your wife is not here . " " The Chairman wishes to speak with the Americans . It is urgent . " She sat up quickly . " Why ? " " There is unrest , in Poland and Germany . " She cursed . " They dare ! " " Da . They dare . " Now that we can not send the army . Now that the army is needed in the Turkic republics , and Latvia , and Estonia . " I hate them , " Lorena said . They were under the house , inspecting the support pillars . Carlotta was more frightened than Wes . He tried to reassure her  --  not hearing what he was saying , but knowing he was lying badly . The quake was coming . Soon . These pillars had to be reinforced before the San Andreas fault tore loose and sent everything rolling downhill in a spray of debris . A sound like a brass trumpet ripped through the world ; and then the world tilted and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the acceleration warning , and Russian curses , and the deep hum of Thuktun Flishithy 's drive . The floor was tilted , not toward a wall but toward one corner . . . the outer-aft-antispinward corner . The fithp must be accelerating and decreasing spin , simultaneously . The fithp would have no time for prisoners during maneuvers . Wes did what the others were doing . He spread out on his belly like a starfish and curled his fingers and toes in the padding  --  dry here , though damp throughout the rest of the ship  --  and dozed . The tilt grew more pronounced as Thuktun Flishithy 's spin decreased . After several hours everyone shifted to the aft wall . They were awake and talking , but not to Wes Dawson . Once he heard " amusement park " in English , and Nikolai made roller-coaster motions with his hands while the rest laughed . Another several hours and the aft wall had become a flat floor . Thuktun Flishithy 's drive was pushing at one Earth gravity or close to it . The door opened.  |p209It  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through without pause . They herded the humans into the corridor , where four more warriors waited with the teacher 's female assistant , Tashayamp . Dmitri bowed to her . " Greetings , " he said ( the pattern of sound that they had learned for a greeting ; it had the word time in it ) . " Question , destination selves ? " " Destination Podo Thuktun , " Tashayamp said . " Ready your minds . " With no superior present , she seemed surer of herself . Now , what gave him that impression ? Wes watched her . She walked like an unstoppable mass , a behemoth . She was n't adjusting her gait ! He had seen her veer from contact with warriors and humans alike . Now the warriors were presumablyher guardians , and her human charges had demonstrated both the agility and the motivation to dodge her ton-plus of mass . Never mind ; there was something he wanted from her . " Question , destinationThuktun Flishithy ? " " In two mealtime-gaps this status will end . There will be almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . You must learn to live so , " she said . She had n't answered his question ; but then , they often did n't . The corridor branched . The new corridor dipped , then curved to the right . Now , why the curve ? This ought to be a radial corridor . Wes remembered that the streets of Beverly Hills had been laid in curves just to make them prettier . Was that it ? Under spin the corridor would rise at twenty or twenty-five degrees . . . But under spin , a radial corridor would be vertical . Fithp could n't climb ladders . The routes inward had to be spirals . Look for fast elevators too ? As the Soviets had stopped talking to Wes , so Wes had stopped talking to them . He had fallen into a kind of game . Observe . Deduce . Who will learn faster , you or me ? Tashayamp says we 'll be living in nearly free-fall in a day or so . What makes nearly free-fall , and why not spin the ship to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that low . What could prevent them from spinning the ship ? Ah . An asteroid , of course . They 've got an asteroid base , a small one , and we 're going to be moored to it . I wish to hell they 'd let us near a window . And now we 're to see the Podo Thuktun . They showed that in the picture show . Installing the Podo Thuktun was a big deal , so important that they recorded it and showed it to us . As important as the fuel . So what was it ? Thuktun means message or lesson or a body of knowledge ; I 've heard them use it all three ways . Thuktun is part of the mother ship 's name . Fistarteh-thuktun , the sleeper with the tapestry harness , is mated to thuktun and does n't seem to have a normal mate . What , then , are we about to see ? The curved corridor ended in a massive rectangular door . Unlike most , this door did n't seem to have automatic controls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troop marched in.  |p210A  spiral ramp ran up the sides of the cylindrical chamber . The cylinder was nearly empty : conspicuous waste in a starship . In the center was a vertical pillar no thicker than Wes 's wrist . He looked up to where it expandedinto a flower-shaped cradle for .. . For the Podo Thuktun , of course . It was a relic of sorts : a granite block twenty-five or thirty feet long by the same distance wide by half that in height . Its corners and edges were unevenly rounded , as if it had weathered thousands of years of dust-laden winds . There was writing on it . In it : Wes could see overhead light glinting through the lines . Something like a thread-thin laser had written script and diagrams all the way through the block . He was being left behind . Tashayamp and half the warriors were escorting the Soviets up the spiral ramp ; the other warriors were coming for Wes . He hurried to join them . Platforms led off the ramp at varying heights , and on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruders . Fistarteh-thuktun and his spaceborn acolytes looked down for a long moment of meditation before beginning their work . It was a ritual , and necessary . One could become too used to the Podo Thuktun ; could take it for granted . That must never happen . At one time bloody wars had been fought over the diagram in the central face of the Podo Thuktun . Was that diagram in fact a picture of a Predecessor ? Half the world had been conquered by the herd that thought it was . Many generations had passed , and heretics had been raped of their status with dismaying regularity , before the fithp realized the truth . Message Bearer 's interstellar ramjet had been made from that diagram . The priest and his acolytes turned to the library screen . Paykurtank tapped at a tab the size of a human 's fist . The screen responded by showing a succession of photographs . One after another , granite half-cubes appeared in close-up against varying half-seen backgrounds . " Skip a few , " Koolpooleh suggested . " I countermand that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at them all . We 're seeking any relevant information left by the Predecessorsregarding aliens , or Winterhome , or its natives . " The thuktunthp were arrayed in order of their discovery , and roughly in order of simplicity of the lesson delivered . The history of the fithp could be read in the order of discovery of the thuktunthp . Uses of fire , mining and refining of metals , uses of the wheel : the Predecessors had made these easily available to their successors . Later discoveries had been found in caves or mountaintops or lifeless deserts . " Pause that . Koolpooleh , is this nothing but mathematics ? " " I have no trouble reading the Line Thuktun , Fistarteh-thuktun . Simple plane geometry , a list of axioms . " " Go to the next one . "  | " The Breaker has arrived with trainees . " " Ignore them . Pause that ! " Koolpooleh and Paykurtank were watching the humans , furtively , with one eye each . Fistarteh-thuktun pretended not to notice . Perhaps they could learn from watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now aground and dealing with the prey . Fistarteh-thuktun remembered what it was like to run , to take prey from a rushing stream , to see nothing but mountains in the distance and clouds overhead .. . These creatures must first be defeated . Surely the knowledge was here ! All knowledge was contained in the thuktunthp . The Life-Thuktun was surely interesting enough . The script and diagrams dealt with biology , and Fistarteh-thuktun had studied it before . Hierarchies of plant life to the left , animal life to the right . Tiny , ancient single-nucleated life at the bottom , scaling toward complex warm-blooded air breathers at the top . Simple sketches at every level . The sketch that was third from the top resembled a stunted fi ' . It was bulky , flat-skulled , with but one branch to its trunk . The feet were clubs , each with a tiny afterthought of a claw . The creatures sketched above the proto-fi ' were extinct , though skeletons had been found preserved in soft sedimentary rock . Other pictured life forms had disappeared too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Predecessor ? Would n't they have considered themselves the top of the ladder of life ? Wars had been fought over that question , too . It was not easy to ignore Tashayamp , half an octuple of soldiers , and four of Winterhome 's small , flat-faced natives , including one in a wheeled cage . Fistarteh-thuktun could hardly fail to hear Takpusseh lecturing them in baby talk . He let himself glance at the humans . They did n't resemble that top sketch in any way . Fistarteh-thuktun felt a relief he would not let himself admit . Since his revival from the death-sleep , the priest 's position had never been stronger . The average fi ' aboard Message Bearer had no grasp of what the Predecessors were all about , or how much Fistarteh-thuktun did n't know . But he had a task . He must advise the officers . He must seek any relevant information left by the Predecessors . He had Koolpooleh 's attention again . " Go on , " he said . The next thuktun explained the making of aluminum . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Predecessors ? " No pictures of selves . Shape of Predecessor minds , half known . " Tashayamp was speaking slowly , and Wes was catching most of the meaning , he thought . He had to concentrate . " There were eights of eight-cubed of thuktunthp scattered about the world . The Predecessors "  --  Tashayamp glanced toward the priest , busy at his huge display screen , and her breathy trumpet ofa voice dropped a little  --   | " did not know everything . They did not know that what they did with their machines would ruin the world for them . Maybe they did not know where life would be in the world , after the world healed . They left the thuktunthp everywhere . " Not told , things about fithp , things about Predecessors . Perhaps thuktunthpwere thuktun "  --  meaning message here  --  " to Predecessor children 's children . But Predecessor children were not made . " Arvid asked , " What happened ? " " Fistarteh-thuktun knows . I talk to him . Wait . " Tashayamp turned away . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down . From below , the cradle had blocked some of the script . From above , it did n't . The sculptors had left a meter or more of margin around the writing ; it had worn away unevenly , leaving bulges the cradle arms could grip . The script was lost to him . Wes studied the diagrams . The patterns in the Podo Thuktun : here a spray of dots in which Wes could recognize the Summer Triangle : a star pattern . There a pattern of curves that might be the magnetic fields in a Bussard ramjet . . . Podo could mean starflight or stars or just sky . Certain words and phrases became clear . He was sure that Thuktun Flishithy meant Thuktun Carrier or Message Bearer . Fistarteh-thuktun was a priest ; it might be that he worshiped the Podo Thuktun . He seemed to function as a librarian too . Loremaster . Fistarteh-thuktun had turned from the screen and was talking with Tashayamp , too fast to be understood . " Not known what happened to end Predecessor children , " Tashayamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have destroyed the world . Perhaps they can not have children . " She spread her digits in the pattern Dawson had come to call a shrug : a futile clawing at the air . It meant , " I do not know and do not believe it can be known . " She turned back to Fistarteh-thuktun . Wes studied the star patterns again . The constellations are nearly the same as Earth 's . Nearly , but not identical . They must be from somewhere near  --  He shuddered . Can more be coming ? No , only one ship was in the films they showed us . " Nearby " is meaningless when we 're talking about stars ! Fistarteh-thuktun was speaking again . Wes moved closer to listen to Tashayamptranslate into fithp baby-talk . Their quarters had become tolerable as the fithp learned what they liked . The padding over the six walls was no longer wet . Dawson was almost comfortable . Dmitri was speaking English . Dawson was ashamed at how glad that made him . I am not a communist . Nobody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't live alone !  | " They were dying . Wes , did it sound as if they destroyed their environmentthemselves ? " " I thought that 's what Fistarteh-thuktun said . " " But they must have thought some of them would live . Changed . Could it be true ? " " Do you mean , could the Predecessors be their ancestors ? No . There was a thuktun onscreen with a column of biology sketches till Fistartehthuktunshifted to something else . Did n't you notice the sketches ? That misshapen fi ' was third from the top . If you were making a hierarchy of life on Earth , would you put humanity third from the top ? " " No , " Dmitri said in some irritation , " but I might leave humanity off entirely if I were Christian or some such ! Then I might put apes third from the top , if I seriously liked dolphins and whales ! " " That 's too many ifs . " " Or a Christian or Muslim might put fanciful angels above him  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tashayamp believes , " Arvid said soothingly . " The fithp have studied the subject for much longer than the hour we have been granted . So . A race died of overpollution . The world was changed . In the changed world something new grew up  --  perhaps a pet or a work animal , an evolved dog or horse . They do seem to worship the Predecessors . " " Why would n't they ? " Wes wondered . " Consider what would happen to tribes who did n't study the thuktunthp . There were . . . eight to the fourth power is around four thousand thuktunthp , and a lot of them were duplicates . For every one of those , the first tribe  --  herd ?  --  to use the informationwould be the first to rule . It must have happened hundreds of times . Of course they worship the Predecessors ! " Arvid shrugged . " I like to think of them as a tamed elephant . Then the world came apart . Dwarfing is caused by ages of famine . Flash floods winnowedthose who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled . " There is no proof . Choose the picture you like . " "  --  Shape wars , " Dmitri said . " Is it your belief that these were religious wars based on interpretation of the thuktunthp ? " " Yes , " Dawson said . " Wars over the shape of the Predecessors . " He shook his head . " Very strange . " Dmitri laughed . " Why strange ? Human history is full of such . The ByzantineChurch was divided , and civil wars resulted , from what icons were permitted to be shown in churches . The Christian god has no shape , yet one of the prophets was permitted to see his hindquarters . Not his front , you understand . Only his hindquarters . I do not know if that resulted in wars among the Jews , but it easily might . " " You 'd think there would be some pictures of the Predecessors , " Dawson said.  | " Perhaps there were , " Dmitri mused . " Only  --  suppose there were descendentsof the Predecessors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy thing to face , that you had killed the sons of your gods . " One hell of a guilt trip . " Or maybe there were pictures of the Predecessors , " Wes said . " Maybe they were destroyed as blasphemous , in the period when they thought the Bussard ramjet diagram was the shape of a Predecessor . " " Perhaps , " Arvid said . " And then  --  excuse me , " Dmitri said . He spoke rapidly in Russian . After a while the Russians moved away to their own corner , leaving Wes Dawson alone again . They do n't trust me . I might do something to warn the aliens . At least I have a few answers . I need answers ! Nat Reynolds could remember exactly when he got into trouble . It started the second morning after the aliens blew up Kosmograd , ending the sciencefictionconvention where he was guest of honor , and stranding him in Kansas City . He was sitting in Dolly Jordan 's breakfast room , with good coffee and eggs sunny-side up , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories about alien invaders were turning bloodily obsolete . Why could n't it have been Wells ' martians ? We 'd have had ' em in zoos inside of twenty-four hours . " There 's somebody here to see you , " Dolly Jordan had said . She set another plate and a coffee cup at the table . Nat looked up with irritation . Someone he 'd met at the OZcon ? But the man Dolly led into her breakfast room did n't have the look . He was too old ( although there were older science-fiction fans ) and too well dressed ( although some fans dressed well ) , and what was it ? He just did n't have that sensitive fannish face . " I 've looked all over for you , " the man said . " Hah . You do n't remember me , do you ? I 'm Roger Brooks . Washington Post . " You 'd think the press would know by now : no science-fiction writer can be expected to function before noon . Nat shook his head . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mind if I sit down ? " " Dolly already set a place for you . " Brooks sat . Dolly appeared with a coffeepot . She was plump and cheerful , and smart enough not to chatter in the morning . After she filled Brooks 's cup , she went back to the kitchen , leaving them alone . " Why were you looking for me ? " Reynolds asked . " Because you probably know where the government is . " Reynolds shook his head in confusion . " Just before the aliens arrived , all the science-fiction writers vanished , " Brooks explained . " At least all the hard science-fiction writers did . " " Oho ! "  | " You do know something . " Brooks leaned forward eagerly . " What ? " " Nothing real , " Nat said . " A month or so ago , Wade Curtis called . Askedwhere I 'd be when the aliens arrived . When I told him I 'd he Guest of Honorat OZcon , he changed the subject . " " And that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to violate that kind of promise . What 's this about the government ? " " The President left Washington two hours after the aliens blew up Kosmograd , " Brooks said . " By yesterday morning , the Cabinet and most of the Pentagon brass were gone . " Brooks shrugged . " No stories left in Washington . Nobody there knows what 's happening . " " So you came looking for me ? " " Yeah . The writers vanished a couple of weeks ago . Then just before the aliens arrived , the President sent an important intelligence officer to Colorado to talk to them . I figure that 's where the government went , to Cheyenne Mountain . Kansas City 's on the way . " Roger sipped his coffee . " When the hotel said you 'd left with the whole SF convention , I took a chance and came to the chairman 's house . " " Sorry you went to so much trouble for nothing  --  " " Maybe not for nothing , " Brooks said . " Look , the writers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invited . You have the invitation , I have a press pass and a VW Rabbit diesel with more than enough fuel to get there . Want to pool our resources ? " I do n't have any invitation to Cheyenne Mountain . I was booked at the OZcon , so I was n't invited . All I had to do was say so ! And I always sign too many book contracts . I have trouble saying no . If I were a woman I 'd be pregnant all the time . Reynolds stood at a second-story window at Collins Street . The apartmentbuilding was separated from the street by a wide grassy strip . The buildings were old brick , with a new McDonald 's just down the block . They were in Lauren , Kansas , somewhere near Topeka . He 'd never been in the town before , and did n't want to be here now , but there was n't much choice , because while they were driving across Kansas the sky erupted with paper airplanes carrying baby elephants . He 'd met Carol North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in Lauren , Kansas . They 'd gone to her apartment . We could have kept on driving . There ca n't be that many aliens . They ca n't be everywhere .. . Instead they 'd parked in an underground lot and waited . The invaders came . A ceremony , Reynolds thought . It even makes sense . Humiliating , but it makes sense . And once they 've put you through that , they leave you alone . What do they want ? Reynolds turned hack to the window . In the street outside , three men hid among the trash cans behind the Mel ) onald 's . They 'd laid dinner platesp216on the street surface . From somewhere nearby came the roar of large motors . " You had to tell them , " Reynolds said . " It was a story I 'd heard from the Hungarian uprising . How did I know they 'd try it ? " " Bat turds , Roger ! George Bergson was itching to kill an alien , so you told him how ! You knew he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're too close . What if they bomb this building ? " Roger Brooks shrugged . " George promised they would n't to anything to call attention to this place . " " He 's going to get himself killed , " Reynolds said . " And probably us with him . " " Stop saying that , " Carol North said . " Please stop saying that . " " Okay . " But it does n't change anything . Your friend is doomed , lady . A thought came unbidden . She 'd come to his room at the convention . Her relationship with George Bergson was clearly an open one . Would she be faithful to his memory once he got killed ? That could be inconvenient . The roaring grew louder . " They 're coming , " Roger said . " The snouts are coming ... " He stayed armored vehicles came into view . They floated a foot or more off the road surface . Their crews were invisible inside . It 'll be okay . George will kill some invaders and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly to safety . Right ? But Nat 's belly and guts were knotted in fear . He heard Roger say , " It worked in Budapest ... " The first ground effect vehicle approached the line of dinner plates and stopped . Something protruded from the forward deck and extended toward the plates . George Bergson and his friends stood and threw their bottles at the armoredvehicles . Two of the bottles hit the lead tank , and burst into flames . Flame spread across the vehicle , and rivers of fire ran off its sides and were dispersed by the ground effect fan . There was a high-pitched whine and grinding noises , and the vehicle fell heavily to the roadway . Two more gasoline bombs arced out . The second vehicle began rapid fire . Holes the size of baseballs appeared in the buildings behind Bergson and his crew . The men dashed behind the McDonald 's building . The gunfire continued . The McDonald 's building was chopped nearly in half . The upper part of the building fell into the lower part . From somewhere far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wreckage exploded in flame . The green light-pencil drew an expanding spiral around the pillar of flame , first tightly , then in ever-spreading arcs that grew and grew . . . Reynolds dived away from the window.  |p217There  was the sound of crashing glass . The tank outside continued to fire , and two large holes appeared in the wall in front of him . Carol and Roger Brooks dove into the hallway . Carol lay next to Reynolds . " Jesus , " she whispered . " Jesus Christ . They 're killing everybody  --  you knew ! " Reynolds shook his head . " I did n't know , but it was a good guess . Look at them ! Herd beasts . No speed , and all their defenses in front , and have you ever seen less than six together ? I bet their ancestors stood in a ring to fight . It was a reasonable guess that if someone does something they do n't like , they go after the offenders ' whole herd , not just the individual ! " The gunfire continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The building 's on fire . " Trapped ! " Out the back way , " Roger Brooks said . " Quick ! " He crouched low and ran down the hallway to the stairs . " Stay low . Stay away from win-dows ! " Nat Reynolds ran down the hall . He heard Carol behind him . Roger sat in the biggest Cadillac in the lowest level of the underground parking structure . It was noon . They 'd been here almost twenty hours . There were sounds from inside another Caddy two cars away . Jeez , what does she see in him ? Roger wondered . They were at it not six hours after her live-in boyfriend bought it . And you 're jealous , because you had nothing to distract you from the thought that they 'd tumble the building down on your head . Or from themThere had n't been any sounds from outside for hours . Roger could n't stand it any longer . He crept toward the exit . Another small group  --  a man , two women , and four small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stared at Roger as he went past , but they did n't say anything . The ramp was blocked by debris , but the stairs were intact . Roger climbed up , pausing at each landing . " Ho . " He jumped , startled . The voice had been feminine and definitely human . " Hello . " " It 's quiet out there , " she said . Roger climbed up to the landing . She was older than he 'd thought from her voice . Roger guessed she was almost forty . She wore jeans and a wool shirt and a bandana , and her face was covered with soot and grime . Her nose had once been broken , and was n't quite straight . Not quite ugly , but she could work on it . " What 's hap-pening ? " " I think they 've gone . I 'm Rosalee Pinelli , by the way . " " Roger Brooks . Where did they go ? " She shrugged . " All I know is they were out there all night . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Did you go look ? " She shook her head vigorously . " Not me . We did n't hear anything for a couple of hours , so about dawn the five guys who were in here with me went out to look . " She indicated a hole in the concrete structure . " You can see ' em through here . " Roger looked . There was a pile of bodies in the street . " That 's more than five . " They made a pile , " Rosalee said . " They left people alone until some guys blew one of their tanks . " She shook her head . " Goddam , it was beautiful ! They used dinner plates to look like mines , and when one of the snouts stopped they hit it with Molotov cocktails ! Beautiful ! " " Until the snouts blew up the town , " Roger said under his breath . " Yeah . I saw it . " " After that , the snouts started that pile of bodies out there , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about nine this morning , but I 've been afraid to go out . " " I 'll look around . " " Be careful  --  here , I 'll come with you . " " They 're gone , " Brooks said . " Let 's get the hell out of here . " " How ? " Nat Reynolds asked . " There 's some junk on the ramp , " Brooks said . " But with a little work we can get it clear and drive out . " " Are n't there cars up above ? " " Not like this one , " Brooks said . He patted the VW diesel Rabbit . " I can get two thousand miles on the fuel in this . More , now that we drained that truck . " " Come on , Nat . I 'll help , " Carol said . She took his hand . Possessive as hell . " Yeah , let 's get at it , " Roger said . Rosalee was already tossing away light debris . In an hour they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled into the Rabbit . I do n't remember asking either of the women . Not that it matters . Reynolds is n't going to leave that one behind , and there 's room for Rosalee . I might as well get her story . " Where to ? " Reynolds asked . " Colorado Springs . The government 's got to be there . " " East ! " Rosalee shouted . " Away from the snouts ! " " I 'm for that , " Reynolds agreed . They drove up the ramp . " You sure they 're gone ? " Carol asked . " Yeah , " Roger said . " I looked . " They came out of the structure . Lauren , Kansas , looked like Berlin after World War II . Buildings were gutted . Bodies lay in the streets , not just the pile the snouts had created , but others as well.  | " Godalmighty damn , " Roger muttered . He threaded his way through the debris . " All that in revenge for one tank  --  " " Traitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rogues , or crazies . " " What the hell do you mean by that ? " Rosalee demanded . " We surrendered , " Reynolds said . " As far as they 're concerned , we surrendered , and then we attacked them . " " That does n't make sense , " Carol protested . I wonder . Roger drove past another ruined building . " How do you know , Nat ? " Reynolds laughed . " I do n't . I 'm guessing . But look , gang , I 'm not a scientist and I 'm not a newsman . When I guess wrong , nothing happens . Maybe I even sell the story  --  " " If you guess wrong here you 'll get us all killed ! " Rosalee snarled . " Shall I stop guessing ? We could die that way too , because I 'm the only expert you 've got . " When they reached the end of the debris , he turned south despite the others ' protests . There was no sign of an enemy.  |p220No  battle plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : H PLUS 180 HOURSThe engineers who built Message Bearer must have considered the communal mudroom expendable . They had located it just inside the hull . This had its advantages . Under spin , a srupk 's depth of mud formed a shell inside the hull ; it would shield the ship from an unexpected attack . Mud boiling from a rent would freeze in place , a plug to hold air . The mudroom was under full spin gravity . Winterhome 's mass and surfacegravity had been established by telescopic studies , a year before the ship reached the ringed giant . For sixteen years , since birth in many cases , the communal mudroom had taught fithp to move under Winterhome gravity . Warriors bound for the surface would have at least that advantage . It was the biggest room aboard Message Bearer , covering an eighth of the hull surface of the life support region . From the middle it curved out of sight in both directions . The mud was good sticky-wet homeworld dirt below , with nearly clear water floating on top . Fathisteh-tulk remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still close , but not oppressivelyso . Generations of spaceborn had decorated it with painted friezes . Above his head was a full-sized representation of a thuktun : a weathered granite rectangle covered with script and with a centered representation of a thuktun , which was covered with script and a representation of a thuktun , which . . . Fathisteh-tulk wondered if the priest listarteh-thuktun had everp221seen this part of the ceiling . Such a thuktun would be a legendary thing . The thuktunthp spoke of every subject a fi ' could imagine , but none spoke of the thuktunthp themselves , nor of their makers . Fathisteh-tulk was the only sleeper in a crowd of spaceborn . " It 's not that we do n't trust planets , " the gangling warrior said . " We trust one planet , the Homeworld , the world on which you were born , sir . We trust other worlds to obey other rules . " " Mating seasons , " Fathisteh-tulk said , half listening . He filled his mouth and sprayed water at a spaceborn female , barely mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between spaceborn and sleepers had to be broken , even if done one fi ' at a time . There was power in Fathisteh-tulk 's lungs . She preened in the spray , then ( belatedly , but as protocol required ) sprayed him back . She was just able to reach him . The gangling warrior  --  Rashinggith ? something like that  --  was still talking . " Exactly ! The target world orbits in about seven eighths of a Homeworldyear . After three generations in space , we still follow a mating season of one year ; and the sleepers , because they were wakened at the wrong time  --  " " I know . During your mating season we feel a discomfort , an itch we ca n't wet . " " It 's the same with us . So . Will both mating seasons be skewed on the target planet ? " The spaceborn dissidents did not obey the custom established by the Herdmaster . They would not call the target world Winterhome . " Suppose some of us adjust and some do not ? A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildly in heat all the time . Pfoo ! " " Two mating seasons a year might be fun . If it comes , it will come whether we land or not . " " And that 's only one possible problem . There are bound to be parasites we never adjusted to  --  " A voice bellowed through the room . " Tulk ! " " I am summoned , " Fathisteh-tulk said , and he moved toward the voice of his mate , answering with a cheerful " Tulk ! " Moving among sleepers now , spraying muddy water to greet friends , he passed beneath an older frieze . The time was mating season , by the state of the foreground plants and the activities of half-seen fithp among the trees . I lc had worked on this bas-relief himself . He was pleased to see that it had been kept up , repainted . But these next ones were recent . Here a swath of jet black powdered with white points , and a small pattern of concentric rings : the Winterhome still , repeatedly outlined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm-ball with its company of moons , and the raggedly curved horizon of the Foot , with a mining party around a digit ship tanker " Ttilk ! " He stopped his dawdling.  |p222She  waited impatiently at the exit . Smaller than the average female , Chowpeentulk was turning massive with the increase in her unborn child . She said , " Come . We must discuss . " The platform elevator lifted them into a corridor . Fathisteh-tulk said , " We are halfway between Winterhome and the Foot . What can be urgent ? " " You were among dissidents ! " " So I was . Dissidence is n't forbidden . " " Tulk , I think it will be , soon . The dissidents claim that the War for Winterhome is unnecessary . I remind you that we are fighting that war now . Will you persuade warriors not to fight , even as they struggle with the prey ? Need I remind you that Fookerteh is even now on the ground of Winterhome , and that he is the favorite of K'turfookeph ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear makes sense . We reached the ringed gasball with the ship depleted of virtually every necessity . Within three years Message Bearer was resupplied . We could have left then if we had not needed the Foot , or we could have stayed as long as we liked . " Fathisteh-tulk had not bred her when mating season followed the Awakening . This was common enough , even expected , among males who had lost status . Chowpeentulk remembered that she had been almost relieved . Her next child would not be of fighting age during the War for Winterhome . The Traveler Herd had reached the ringed gasball and were at work on the Foot when her season came again . Again her mate was impotent . Perhapsshe had treated him badly then . She remembered her own irritability well enough . The next season he had recovered ; and the season after that had borne fruit . Her mate 's status as the Herdmaster 's Advisor had been enough ; he had recovered his self-respect . She had been slow to recognize the other change in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources we need , and no prey to be robbed . We  --  " " Tulk ! Have you forgotten what it is like to wallow in natural mud beneath an open sky ? To take natural prey ? The difference between a shower and rain ? " He hesitated . " No . " " Then what is this nonsense ? " " I 've talked to spaceborn . They do n't remember . They do n't miss it . Tulk , we 've started the war , and that is well . But if we have to back off , we know the natives ca n't follow us . We should be prepared for this . A generation hence we may be trading with them , nitrogen for refined metals  --  " " Trading ? With fragile , misshapen things that look like they would fall over any moment ? " " Is n't that better than enslaving them into the Traveler Herd ? We would then be living with them . Can you picture them as our equals , generations from now ? That is the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that picture . " It wo n't hurt to keep those now in power a little unbalanced . I want to keep their minds working . The dissidents are doing something worthwhile . " That dangerous , destructive humor . She simply had n't noticed in time . Fathisteh-tulk was not mad , exactly . Not suicidal . He would never hurt the Traveler Tribe or his family or their cause . But political interactions just did n't mean anything to him anymore . Nor did his mate 's authority in matters of family . In the twelve years that passed between her first and second pregnancies , he had lost his sense of these nuances too . " We are at war , " she said . " When a herd moves it must not scatter to the winds . " " It may be a needless war . Certainly these think so . " " Let them do their work without your support . You 're damaging the position of all sleepers . The first step is docility . " " We have not joined a new tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be that I am wrong . I intend to find out . " " How ? " But that he would not tell her . Jenny led the way inside . The large conference room was filled with sound , although there were n't more than a couple of dozen people in the room . Knots of people , mixed groups of science-fiction writers , uniformed officers , and civilian defense analysts stood at blackboards , others around tables . Viewscreens had been set up to show what was displayed on the big situation-roomscreens . It reminded Jenny of the newsroom at JPL during the Saturn encounter . There 's Ed . One of the officers was her brother-in -- law , Ed Gillespie . She 'd heard about his arrival , but she 'd been too busy to see him . There 'd been nothing useful in his report on the mission to deliver Congressman Dawson to Kosmograd , and Jenny had no time for social visits . Jack Clybourne came in after Jenny . He looked nervously at the crowd in the room . " Seems all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . Jenny advanced into the room . " Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States . " She got a reaction to that . All the military people jumped to attention . The science-fiction writers stared curiously ; then those sitting down rememberedtheir manners and stood . The babble quieted , although there was an undertone of whispered conversation . The President came in with Admiral Carrell and General Toland . He looked blankly at the large room with its disorderly crowd . " Carry on , " Admiral Carrell said . " Well , Major ? It 's your show . " " Yes , sir . " Jenny led the way to the blackboard where Ed C ; illespic stood with the group of writers who 'd been chosen as spokespeople . Anson , ofp224course . He does n't look very strong . Dr. Curtis . Joe Ransom . I guess Sherry Atkinson was too shyBy the time the President arrived the writers were talking to each other , but they fell silent when he reached them . The President nodded to Ed Gillespie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to let Jenny introduce him to the writers . " Mr. President , this is Robert Anson . He 's the senior man among the writers . " " Mr. President , " Anson said formally . He introduced the others . " David Coffey , " the President said . " Major Crichton says you 've got something for me . " " Yes , sir , " Anson said . " Thank you for coming . I 'll not waste more time in pleasantries . First . It now seems clear that their objective is conquest , either of the Earth or of a substantial part of it . The evidence says they want it all . " " What evidence is that ? " the President asked . He sounded curious , rather than demanding . " They chose to attack the United States , " Anson said . " Clearly the strongest nation on Earth . " " But  --  " Anson fell silent at the interruption , but when the President did n't say anything else , he continued . " Clearly the strongest nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams , cities , cultivated lands , harbors , electronic emissions  --  allwould indicate that the United States is the dominant nation . " Anson looked around as if for contradictions , but no one said anything . " Yet they chose to land here , and according to all the intelligence reports we have , they 're setting up a perimeter defense . As if they intend to stay . " " We 'll see about that , " General Toland muttered . Anson raised an eyebrow . Toland looked around nervously . " We 're planning a big attack , " he said . " In about two hours . " " With what ? " Dr. Curtis demanded . Toland looked at the writer with disapproval . " It will be a large assault , " the President said . " Mr. Anson , I agree that they intend to stay . Do they have a choice ? I do n't see how they can expect to launch enough ships to get their people off the Earth . " " Lasers , " Curtis said . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sorry , it 's Bob 's turn . " " We 'll let Dr. Curtis explain in a moment , " Anson said . " We agree then that they 've come to stay . Despite their early successes , I would be greatly surprised if they expected this first effort to succeed . Eventually we 'll win , throw them out of Kansas . Surely they expect that . Therefore , they plan other attempts . One supposes they will make certain preparations for those attempts . "  | " What might they do ? " the President asked . Anson turned to Joe Ransom . " Mr. Ransom will address that . " " They 've already used kinetic energy weapons , " Ransom said . " It 's clear that any ship capable of crossing interstellar space will have a very powerful engine . Mr. President , I think they 'll drop a Dinosaur Killer . " The President looked puzzled , but Joe Ransom was only hitting his stride . " An asteroid some nine kilometers across very probably killed the dinosaurs and wiped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a layer of dead clay that corresponds to that era , and we find asteroidal material in it , all over the world  --  but skip the evidence ; it almost does n't matter . What mattersis that the aliens have already thrown rocks , and they 've got the power to move a small asteroid . We 've got the mathematics to work out the results . The effects will be global , and very bad . " There 's an understatement , Jenny thought . Jack 's scared too . Well , we ought to be . " Depending on how large , and where it strikes , an asteroid could do just about anything , " Anson said . " Tidal waves may destroy many coastal cities . Cloud cover : we could get weeks or months of endless night and endless rain . It could trigger a new ice age . " " You ca n't be sure they 'll hit us with an asteroid , " the President said . " It 's the way to bet . I wish we could guess how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anson said . " They obviously have the ability to do it . They 've been out in space for fifteen years . Surely they 've thought of it . " " I see . " Coffey nodded seriously . " Is there anything we can do about it ? " Admiral Carrell demanded . " Could we deflect it ? " " How ? They shoot down anything we send up , " Curtis said . " So what do we do ? " Admiral Carrell asked . Anson turned to the other writer . " Dr. Curtis has given that some thought . Wade  --  " " We 'll never beat them while they own space , " Curtis said . " As long as they control space , they can find junk to hit us with . One Dinosaur Killer after another . " Blunt son of a bitch , Jenny thought . " We ca n't stop them from bombarding us with asteroids until we can take control of space again , and we 'll never get space away from them while they have that mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Admiral Carrell said . " But a navy needs ships , Dr. Curtis ! " " Orion , " Curtis said . " Old bang-bang . " The President looked puzzled , and Jenny thought Curtis looked pleased as he turned to the blackboard . Not too often a writer gets to lecture to the President of the United States. " ' fake a big metal plate , " Curtis said . " Big and thick . Make it a hemisphere , but it could even he flat . Put a large ship , say the size of a battleship ,  |p226on  top of it . You want a really good shock absorber system between the plate and the ship . " Now put an atom bomb underneath and light it off . I guarantee you that sucker will move . " He sketched as he talked . " You keep throwing atom bombs underneath the ship . It puts several million pounds into orbit . In fact , the more mass you 've got , the smoother the ride . " Admiral Carrell looked thoughtful . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Curtis said . " Get into space , find the mother ship , and go for it . Throw everything we have at it . Ram if we have to . " " Hard on the crew , " the President said . " You 'll have plenty of volunteers , sir , " Ed Gillespie said . " The whole astronaut corps for starters . " True enough . Most of them had friends at Moon Base . Odd , they did use nuclear weapons there , but nowhere on Earth ... . " Is this  --  Orion  --  feasible ? " Admiral Carrell asked . Curtis nodded . " Yes . The concept was studied back in the sixties . Chemicalexplosive test models were flown . It was abandoned after the Treaty of Moscow banned atmospheric nuclear detonations . As far as I know , though , Michael is the only quick and dirty way we have to get a battleship into space . " " Michael ? " the President asked . " Sorry , sir . We 've already given it a code name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Appropriate enough name . However , our immediate problem is to get them out of Kansas . . . " That does no good , " Curtis said . " As long as they own space , they can land whenever and wherever they want , and there 's damned little we can do about it . Mr. President , we have to get to work on Michael now . " The President looked thoughtful . " Perhaps I agree . " He turned to Ed Gillespie . " General , we 're pretty shorthanded here . I believe you 're presentlywithout an assignment ? " " Yes , sir . " " Good . I want you to head up the team for Project Archangel . Look into feasibility , armament , who you need for a design team , where you 'd build it , how long it would take . Report to Admiral Carrell when you know something . Perhaps these gentlemen can help you . " He looked to the writers . " Sure , " Curtis said . " One thing , though  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nat Reynolds . Last I heard , he was in Kansas City . " " Combat area , " General Toland said . " Nat 's pretty agile , though . He may have got away . And he 's just the right kind of crazy , " Curtis said earnestly.  | " Major Crichton can see to that , " the President said . " Now , to return to something you said earlier . Lasers ? " " Yes , sir , " Curtis said . " I believe they 'll use lasers to launch their ships from the ground . " " Why ? " " Why would n't they ? They 've got good lasers , much better than we have , and it 's certainly simple enough if you 've got lasers and power . " " I asked the wrong question , " Coffey said . " How ? " Curtis looked smug again . He sketched . " If you fire a laser up the back end of a rocket  --  a standard rocket-motor bell shape , but thick  --  you get much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's a lot more payload , because you can leave your power source on the ground . Your working mass , your exhaust , is air and vaporized rocket motor , hotter than hell , with a terrific exhaust velocity . It uses a lot of power , but it 'll sure work . Pity we never built one . " " Where would they get the power ? " the President asked . " They 've blown up all our dams . They ca n't just plug into a wall socket . " Curtis pointed to a photograph pinned to his blackboard . It showed a strange , winged object , fuzzily seen against the background of space . " Ransom found that picture , among a lot of them Major Crichton 's peoplegave us to look at , " he said . " Joe  --  " Ransom shrugged . " An amateur astronomer brought that in to the intelligencepeople . I do n't know how he talked the guards into getting it inside , but I ended up with it . It looks like they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We looked into building those , " the President said . " Sure , " Curtis said dryly . " But Space Power Satellites were rejected . Too costly , and too vulnerable to attack . " " They 're vulnerable ? " " Not to anything we have now , " Curtis said . " To attack something in space you 've got to be able to get at space . " Coffey looked around for support . Admiral Carrell shrugged . " It 's true enough , " he said . " They 'll shoot down anything we send up long before it can get that high . " " So what can we do ? " " Archangel , " Ed Gillespie said . " When we send something up , it needs to be big and powerful and well armed . I 'll get on it . " " And meanwhile , they 're throwing asteroids at us , " the President said . " General , I think you 'd better work fast . " He turned to go . " One more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ? " " Today 's attack . I suppose you 'll be sending in lots of armor . " The President looked puzzled . " We 'll do it right , Doctor , " General ' Poland said . I le turned to leave . " And I 'd like to get at it . "  | " Thor , " Curtis said . Toland stopped . " What 's that ? It sounds like something I 've heard of  --  " " Project Thor was recommended by a strategy analysis group back in the eighties , " Curtis said . " Flying crowbars . " He sketched rapidly . " You take a big iron bar . Give it a rudimentary sensor , and a steerable vane for guidance . Put bundles of them in orbit . To use it , call it down from orbit , aimed at the area you 're working on . It has a simple brain , just smart enough to recognize what a tank looks like from overhead . When it sees a tank silhouette , it steers toward it . Drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what happens ? " " Holy shit , " Toland said . " Are these feasible ? " Admiral Carrell asked . " Yes , sir , " Anson said . " They can seek out ships as well as tanks  --  " " But we never built them , " Curtis said . " We were too cheap . " " We would not have them now in any case , " Carrell said . " General , perhaps you should give some thought to camouflage for your tanks  --  " " Or call off the attack until there 's heavy cloud cover , " Curtis said . " I 'm not sure how well camouflage works . Another thing , look out for laser illumination . Thor could be built to home in that way . " " Yes . We use that method now , " Toland said . His tone indicated triumph . These guys did n't know everything . " Maybe we should delay the attack , " the President said . General Toland glanced at his watch . " Too late . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some would n't . The ones that did n't would go in alone , and they 'd sure be slaughtered . On that score , we 've got to get back up to Operations . " " Thank you , gentlemen , " the President said . As they left , Jenny heard Curtis muttering . " What do they do if it does n't work ? They 'll have to call the Russians for help . " The sign read ELVIRA . It could n't have been a large town to begin with . Now it was deserted , except for some military vehicles . There were soldiers in camouflage uniforms at the entrance to the Elvira Little League playing field . Brooks stopped the car . " What ? " In the backseat , Reynolds struggled to wakefulness . " Where are we ? " " Not far from Humboldt , " Brooks said . He got out . Rosalee , half awake now , got out on the passenger side . Nat eased himself out from under Carol 's head and arm and wiggled out past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without waking . Roger had seen people sleep like that after some disaster . In the dark of Carol North 's mind , kinks were straightening out . . . or not . She would wake sane , or not.  | " You ca n't park that here , " one of the soldiers shouted . He was a very young soldier and he looked afraid . There 'd been an edge of panic in his voice , too . Out beyond him the Little League field was covered with troops . They huddled around small fires . Plenty of soldiers . No tanks . No vehicles at all . Why ? Further down the road and on the other side , in what had been a park , was a big tent with a bright red cross on it . Other tents had been put up next to it . There were stretchers outside the tents . " A MASH unit , " Nat Reynolds said . He kept his voice low . " Full up , from the stretchers outside . Roger , Rosalee , I think we better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brooks went up to the soldiers at the gate . He showed them his press card . " What happened , soldier ? " " Nothin ' . ' Roger pointed to the MASH . " Something did . " " Maybe . Look , you ca n't park that thing here . They shoot at vehicles . Maybe at cars ! Move it , damn it , move it ! Then think about going on foot ! " " In a second . Can you call an officer ? " The soldier thought about that for a moment . " Yeah . " He shouted back into the camp . " Sarge , there 's a guy here from the Washington Post wants to talk to the Lieutenant . " They went from the Lieutenant to the Colonel in one step . By then Rosalee was back in the car , but Nat was n't . He found that odd , but he trailed along . " We do n't have facilities for the press , " Colonel Jamison was saying . " In tact , Mr. Brooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't see any reason why I should talk to you . " Brooks looked around the tent . It held two tables and a desk , a field telephone , and a canteen hanging from the center pole . " Colonel , I 'm the only national press reporter here . " Jamison laughed . " And where are you going to publish ? " Roger gave him an answering chuckle . " Okay . I do n't even know if my paper exists anymore ! But surely the people have a right to some news coverage of this  --  " Jamison spoke slowly , from exhaustion . " I 've never been sure of that . Whatever happened to Loose lips sink ships ? Okay , Mr. Brooks . I 'm goingto tell you what happened , but not for the reason you think . " " ' Then why ? " Jamison pointed to Nat Reynolds . " Your friend there . " Nat Reynolds looked up from the map he 'd been studying . " What ? " " You 're an important man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a total of no fewer than forty messages from Colorado Springs , and one of them asks us to watch out for you . That 's why Lieutenant Carper brought you to me . We 're supposed to cooperate with you , and send you back to Cheyenne Mountain tirst chance we get . Now why is that ? "  |p230Reynolds  thought it over , and smiled . " Wade . " The colonel waited . " Dr. Wade Curtis . My partner . He must be working with the government . It follows that he 's alive ... " Reynolds looked back down at the map . " We 're still a long way from Colorado if we ca n't go through Kansas . " " We ca n't , " Jamison said . " God knows we ca n't . " " So what did happen ? " Brooks asked . Jamison sighed . " Nothing to brag about . This morning we were supposedto make a big push . Throw the goddam snouts all the way back to Emporia . Went pretty good at first . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stamped us flat . " " A whole armored division ? " " Three divisions . " Jamison shook his head as if to ward off the memory . " The tanks went in . Everything was fine . We saw some of those floating tanks they use , and we shot the shit out of them ! Then these streaks fell out of the sky . Lines of fire , hundreds of them  --  parallel , slanting , like rain in a wind , they pointed at our tanks and the tanks exploded . " " Thor , " Reynolds said , as if he were talking to himself . He looked up from the map . " That 's what it was . " " You know what did that to us ? " " Yah . It was n't just science fiction , " Reynolds said wonderingly . " Reynolds ! What did they do to my men ? " " It 's an orbital weapon system . They dropped meteors on you , Colonel . There was n't anything you could do . Shall I explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jamison said . " Marty ! Marty , get on the line and see what 's keeping Mr. Reynolds 's transportation ! They need him back at the Springs ! " The helicopter came an hour later . Rosalee was over by the car , pacing , but Carol was awake and frightened . " What will happen to me ? Nat , you ca n't leave me here  --  " " No , of course not . " Reynolds looked around helplessly for someone in charge . He shouted toward the chopper , and a uniformed woman came out , a major . By God ! " Jenny ! " Roger Brooks called . " Jenny , it 's me , Roger ! Can you take me to the Springs ? " " Roger ? Hi ! No , there 's not room . " " You have to make room , " Reynolds shouted . " For Carol ! " Jenny shook her head . " Mr. Reynolds , we have several hundred miles to go . The fuel situation is critical . We ca n't carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooks thought . So what will he do ? " Carol 's not heavy , " Reynolds said . " I 'll leave my suitcase . " " No . " Major Crichton was firm . " Mr. Reynolds , you 'll endanger all of us if you insist . Believe me , your friend is safer here . "  | " Then why am I getting into that thing ? " Reynolds demanded . " Because the President of the United States told me to bring you , " Jenny said . " Sergeant , help Mr. Reynolds aboard . " Reynolds spread his arms , broadcasting helplessness . " If they want me that bad  --  Sorry , Carol . " He let the Army sergeant assist him into the helicopter . Major Crichton climbed in after him . She turned in the doorway to wave ; then the door closed and the engine revved up . And now I 've got five hundred miles to go , fuel for six hundred , and two women to worry about . " Come on , ladies , " Roger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road .

Then she grinned wryly . It did n't look much like the Cabinet Room in the White House . Instead of a big wood conference table , there were two Formica-topped folding tables set together . Most of the chairs were Army issue folding chairs , although they had managed to get one big wooden armchair for the center of the table . A slide projector was set up at one end of the room . Jenny inspected it , turning the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , another score of chairs faced the President 's seat in the center . The U.S. and presidential flags stood behind the chair . They looked out of place against a bare wall . " It 'll have to do . " " What 's that ? " Jack Clybourne came in . " The conference room , " Jenny said . Jack nodded . " Made you a secretary , did they ? " " Somebody 's got to do it , " Jenny protested . " We do n't have a full staff , and  --  " " Gotcha . " " Yep . " " Heck , they have me typing his appointment list , " Jack said . " Not that I mind . Gives me something to do . " She grinned . " Not going to search for bombs in the flag stands ? "  | " Phooey . Whatcha doing after dinner ? " " I do n't know  --  why ? " " My roommate 's going Outside , " Jack said . He grinned . " Of course I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tomorrow . See you about midnight . Now I 've got to go get my science-fiction writers . " Three aides sat at chairs near the wall . No one else was in the room . It would fill according to rank , with the most junior coming in to wait for the more senior . Jack Clybourne studied the names on his list . Joe Dayton from Georgia , the Speaker of the House of Representatives . He 'd be the highest-ranking man after the President . Senator Alexander Haswell of Oregon , the PresidentPro Tern of the Senate . Senator Raymond Carr from Kansas . Admiral Carrell . Hap Aylesworth , with no title listed after his name . Mrs. Connie Fuller , Secretary of Commerce . Jim Frantz , Chief of Staff . General Toland . Arnold Biggs , Secretary of Agriculture . They 'd all have seats at the table . Jenny came in with the science-fiction people . Robert Anson . He seemed older than the last time Jack had seen him . Dr. Curtis . And a new one . " This ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack Clybourneis in charge of security for the President . " " Hi , " Reynolds said . He looks confused . Not that I blame him . Jenny conducted the writers to chairs near the wall . Then she went out again . After a few minutes she returned with an older woman . Attractive , if a bit used . Important . And not on my list at all " This is Mrs. Carlotta Dawson , " Jenny said . Aha . " Thank you . " Jack waited to see where Jenny would seat her . At the table , but at one end , facing the President but with her back to the writers and staff . Jenny went out again . A few minutes later , the rush began . " Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States , " Jack Clybourne announced formally . He does that well , Jenny thought . And it 's needed , a formality to remind us that what we 're doing is important , that this is the real thing . President Coffey took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged Jenny with a nod . Then he nodded to the Chief of Staff . " Jim  --  " " Yes , sir . " Frantz indicated the Xeroxed agenda sheets . " As you can see , we have a lot to cover . " Item One . Appointments . The President has appointed Admiral ThorwaldCarrell as Secretary of Defense . Mr. Griffin , who formerly held thatp234post , will become Under Secretary , and remain with the Vice President . Admiral Carrell will also retain the post of National Security Advisor . LieutenantGeneral Harvey Toland is promoted to General of the Army , and has been designated Commanding General of the United States Armed Forces . " The Vice President , the rest of the Cabinet , and a number of congressionalleaders will remain in the alternate command post , " Frantz continued . " For the moment , the Congress is represented by the Speaker and the PresidentPro Tem of the Senate . Mr. Speaker . " Joe Dayton stood . " Mr. President , this is Mrs. Carlotta Dawson . Being that Congressman Dawson is missing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sort of represent him . It 's not strictly constitutional , but nothing 's very normal just now . " The President nodded wearily . " Thank you , Mr. Speaker . Mrs. Dawson , welcome aboard . We all pray for your husband 's safe return . " " Thank you , Mr. President . " " There 's another reason for Mrs. Dawson to be here , " Speaker Dayton said . " She 's brought in our first by God captive Invader ! " And that got a reaction ! Jenny almost laughed , but she managed to control her face . What if I 'd brought Harry Redd to this Cabinet meeting ! " Thank you , Mr. Speaker , " Jim Frantz said . " To return to the agenda . Our first item of business . The Secretary of Defense . " Admiral Carrell did n't stand . " There 's little to say . Early this morning we launched a non-nuclear attack employing three Regular Army armored divisions , supported by a number of National Guard units and all the militaryaircraft we could muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There were murmurs , but no one said anything . " The enemy used a variety of advanced weapons , " Carrell continued . " The most important were lasers , ground-based and orbital , and spacebasedkinetic energy weapons . Flying spears , if you prefer to think of them that way . They seek out and destroy armored vehicles . " The lasers intercept our missiles . They also backtrack and home in on missile launch sites and artillery . The ground-based laser weapons are radar directed and sufficiently powerful to punch their way through cloud cover . The result was not merely the defeat of our forces but their near annihilation . Major Crichton has recently visited the headquarters of Third Army . Major , how would you describe what you saw ? " " Sir , it was a disaster area , " Jenny said . " I found only one General officer . The rest were killed or missing . The MASH was overfilled , and the only vehicles were commandeered civilian machines , or the very few that had n't been committed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenly . " Was it your opinion that the attacking forces gave it their best ? " " God , yes , Admiral . We could give out a hundred posthumous Silver Stars without even trying . "  | " You agree , General Toland ? " Carrell asked . " Yes , sir . We took our best shot . " " That concludes my report , Mr. President . " There was stunned silence . " Jesus , " the Speaker said . " Admiral , General Toland , what did we do to the enemy ? " " Mr. Speaker , I do n't know , " Admiral Carrell said . " To the best of my knowledge , very little . " " They whupped us , " Dayton said in his careful drawl . " Yes , sir . They whupped us . " " So what do we do now ? " the Speaker demanded . " Use nukes , " General Toland said . " That 's what we 're here to decide , " the President said . " You ca n't nuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! " " We do n't have any choice , " General Toland said . " Choice be damned ! " Carr shouted . " Gentlemen , " Jim Frantz said . " Senator , I agree it 's an extreme measure , " the President said . " But what else can we do ? The aliens must be driven off this planet ! " " At the expense of my people  --  " " Senator , we are n't saving the people of Kansas by doing nothing . The invaders are slaughtering them . Major Crichton , you were there . Describe what you saw . " " Yes , sir . Sergeant  --  " Sergeant Mailey turned on the slide projector . Photographs of a pile of bodies , at least fifty , covered one wall of the room . There were gasps . " We took these pictures in Lauren , Kansas . Much of the slaughter was witnessed by Mr. Nat Reynolds , a member of our special advisory staff . Mr. Reynolds will answer questions later . " Mr. President , our attacking forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their advance . Refugees report that wholesale slaughterof hostages is their general response to any act of resistance . Next slide , Sergeant . " She showed another dozen pictures before mercifully turning the lights back on . Senator Carr looks sick . Well he might . I do n't feel very good myself . " Mr. Reynolds , " the Speaker said . " You saw this happen ? " Nat Reynolds stood . " Yes , sir . More or less  --  " " Why did they do that ? " the President demanded . Reynolds explained the attack . " As soon as the one tank was destroyed , the other started shooting , and they called in the lasers . After they 'd shot up enough buildings , they went hunting individual people , and when they found anyone , they killed him and added him to the pile . " " Jesus . " Senator Carr crossed himself . " ' They thought they were killing traitors , " Reynolds said.  | " What does that mean ? " the President asked . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own initiative . As far as they were concerned , the whole town had surrendered , and when they were attacked , the whole town was in rebellion . It 's the way their minds work . " " Major Crichton , " the President said . " You 've been interrogating the captured alien ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do you agree with their assessment ? " " We have n't learned much from the prisoner except his name , sir . " " Name , rank , and serial number , eh ? " " No , sir . He seems totally cooperative . It 's just that he 's confused . " " He 's insane , " Curtis muttered . " Or certainly will be . " " Why do you say that , Dr. Curtis ? " Admiral Carrell asked . " Herd beast , " Curtis said . " What Nat said  --  they do n't do things on their own initiative . Like elephants . Like zebras . Isolate one of them , and what happens ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one into our herd . It might work , too . " President Coffey looked interested . " How do you do that ? " " Never leave hint alone , " Curtis said . " Talk to him , " Reynolds said . " Surround him with people  --  " " Until he believes he 's human , " Curtis finished . " Have you learned anything useful ? " the President demanded . " No , sir , " Jenny said . " We know they took prisoners from Kosmograd , " Carlotta Dawson said . " Ah . That 's good news , " President Coffey said . Then he frowned . " I suppose it 's good news . At all events , we must decide what to do now . " During the fifty years since its first construction , the underground complex east of Moscow had been decorated , air conditioned , carpeted , and enlarged . There were swimming pools , barbershops , and fine restaurants ; the reinforcedconcrete walls were covered by tapestries and paintings ; and everything had been done to disguise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter . Party First Secretary Narovchatov strode on parquet wooden floors to the Chairman 's office , and remembered another time long ago , when Stalin had reviewed a Guards division during the Great Patriotic War against Hitler . The Germans were so close that the Guards had marched across Red Square and walked directly to the front to take part in an attack . From review to engagement with the enemy , he thought . That will not happen now . The enemy is not so close , but there are enough enemies.  |p237Tartars  , Hungarians , Poles , Latvians , Czechs , were in open revolt , and many others , even the Ukrainians , were restless . Narovchatov strode past the Chairman 's secretary . " Halt , Comrade Narovchatov . " Narovchatov looked up in surprise . A Guards Division colonel stood with three armed soldiers . " I regret , Comrade Narovchatov , that we must search you  --  " There was a roar of laughter from inside the office . Chairman Petrovskiy appeared in the doorway . He chuckled again . " It is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But I think you need not be so diligentwith the First Secretary , who is , after all , my oldest friend . Come in , Nikolai Nikolayevich . My thanks , Comrade Colonel . Return to your du-ties . " Nikolai Narovchatov closed the massive door behind him and stood against it . He had not had time to react . Now he thought of the situation outside and frowned . " Da , " Chairman Petrovskiy said . " It can be that serious . Come and sit , I have much to tell you . Will you have vodka ? Or whiskey ? " " I will join you in a cognac . " Narovchatov took the drink and sat in front of the massive desk . " To humanity , " Petrovskiy said . " No idle toast . " They drank . " Not an idle toast at all , " the Chairman said . " I had a call today . From the American President . " ' " Ah ! " " A very strange call , " Petrovskiy continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need theirs , " Narovchatov said . " Exactly . " " Did you tell them this ? " " In part . I told them that unless they undertook to restrain the Germans , we would not be interested in talking with them . " Petrovskiy paused dramatically . " They agreed instantly . I heard the President give the orders . " " But  --  " " Of course I could not be certain , " Petrovskiy continued . " But I believe they were sincere . Nikolai Nikolayevich , they arc truly desperate . The alien invasion is succeeding . " Narovchatov shook his head in disbelief , as he had when he first heard that an alien army  --  of small elephants !  --  had landed in the American heartland . " Succeeding ? " " Da . The enemy holds their breadbasket , the source of their grain  --  and the Americans have been unable to dislodge them . They have lost some of their best military units . "  |p238For  a moment Narovchatov felt triumph . Then his grin faded . " But Anatoliy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet  --  " " If they can not , we certainly could not , " the Chairman said grimly . " NikolaiNikolayevich , no matter who wins , we have lost . It will be many years before we regain our strength . Do you agree ? " " Da , Anatoliy Vladimirovich . Even if there were no military difficulties , even if we regained control of the provinces and the Warsaw nations without further difficulty , it will take years merely to replace the dams and bridges . " " I believe we must help the Americans , " Petrovskiy said slowly . " How ? " " In every way we can . They have a plan . A coordinated attack , on the enemy ships in space and on the alien forces in Kansas . We will both use our remaining strategic rockets . " " We have few enough left , " Narovchatov said . " I know . " The Chairman paused . " The Americans also want us to use submarine forces . " " For what ? " " Some to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas . " " At Kansas ! " " They also wish us to fire long-range strategic rockets at Kansas . " " To bomb Kansas , " Narovchatov said wonderingly . " Anatoliy  --  ComradeChairman , this is madness ! " " Da . The KGB believes that too . " " They know of this ? " Petrovskiy nodded . " My call was recorded . I had not known that Trusov could do that  --  but within minutes after the President called , he was here . " " He admitted listening ! To you ! " " Da . He professed loyalty , but regarded conversations with the Americansas a matter of state security . " Narovchatov thought furiously . " Thus the colonel and his guards outside your office ? " " And elsewhere . I have sent them to your quarters . And to protect your daughter and grandchildren . " " Are things that serious , then ? " Petrovskiy shrugged . " Chairman Trusov was nearly hysterical . He could not believe that I might seriously consider this proposition . Let the aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy of my enemy is my friend , and the Americans are the enemies of communism everywhere . The aliens are herd beasts , they will respect communism . That is why they have invadedthe United States . The Americans have lost only one state . They have fifty . Let the aliens weaken them more . ' That is what he said . " " Could he be right ? " " Do you believe so ? " Narovchatov shook his head slowly . " No . These aliens , these  --  elephants !  --  arcthe real enemy . They will enslave us all . "  |p239The  Chairman 's face clouded . " And that we will not permit , " he said . His frown deepened , and he pounded his fist against the desk . " No one shall rule us ! Russia shall always remain independent . The worst of the Czars knew that much ! Russia shall obey orders from no outsider ! We must not allow that . " Narovchatov sighed . " You are correct , as always , Anatoliy Vladimirovich . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they resist  --  What shall we do ? " " We will call your son-in-law , and order him to work with Marshal Shavyrin . Together they will develop a plan . " Narovchatov nodded agreement . " Pavel Aleksandrovich will be loyal , " he said . " I have known Shavyrin almost as long as I have known you , " Petrovskiy said . " I can trust him . Within hours he can be with Bondarev at Baikonur . But he must be warned . When he joins Bondarev , he must take with him his loyal troops , his headquarters guards and his personal staff . " It has come to this . " Da . " Narovchatov stood . " I will see to it . " He moved to the door , then turned . " When , Anatoliy ? Will Russia ever have a governmentwithout fear ? " He did not wait for an answer . An octuple of warriors came for them . Gravity was next to nothing . The humans moved in a chaotic cloud , hounding from the corridor walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and four aft , keeping orderly pace , using slippers with surfaces like Velcro that interacted with the damp rugs . Takpusseh and Tashayamp waited where a section of rug-covered wall had been pulled up , leaving a black hole . " Greeting , " Takpusseh said cheerfully . " We must find a task for you until Number Six digit ship arrives . You will clean the air circulation system . Climbing is one thing you may do better than fithp . You will find it easy now that Thuktun Flishithy-chaytrif . " What ? Wes remembered that chaytrif meant foot . Now that the mother ship is mated to a foot ? Never mind . Tashayamp was distributing equipment . To each human was given a sponge , a bag like a plastic garbage bag , a smaller bag filled with soapy water , and a flashlight . All had handles , big metal loops suitable for a fi 's digits . They were strung on a loop of cord . " The outer ducts need you most , " Takpusseh said . " Empty the collectors into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mission , circle this way , spin- , ward . " I lis trunk described a clockwise arc . " Go as far as you can , prove your endurance , then come out at any grill . Summon the first warrior you see . Any warrior will escort you to your cells . "  |p240Would  the fithp really allow prisoners to explore their air duct system ? Arvid and Dmitri seemed as bemused as Wes , but they were obeying , looping the line loosely around themselves . Best to assume that he 'd be watched . Even so , Wes would enjoy the chance to spy a little . Certainly the Soviets would . . . Nikolai was being urged into the hole . Arvid and Dmitri followed . They 'll assume that we 'll want to stay together , but I do n't think we 'll have to . Wes moved toward the opening . A branch of living hose looped around his ankle . " Pause a moment , " Takpusseh said . " Dawson , you are to be separated from the others . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warrior , tell him , ' Raztupisp-minz . ' " Wes shrugged . The Soviets had n't been good company lately . " The cause , I attack you ? " " The cause , we decide this . Go . " He moved through the air ducts , cleaning as he went . The work was not difficult . Do what they want for now . Dmitri wants us docile . He may be right , for now . He worked until he was too tired to go on : five or six hours , he thought . There were wing nuts on the outsides of the grills . Fingers had to reach through the grills to turn them . That was easy enough : the wings were five inches across , suited to fi ' digits . Wes was talking to himself before he realized that the screws turned the wrong way . Takpusseh must have wondered if the humans would be reduced to screaming for help through the grills . He called to two passing warriors . " Take me to Raztupisp-minz . " One stopped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wes paused to refasten the grill , then moved away between the warriors . Lorena brought the teapot . " More tea , Comrade Marshal ? " she asked . " Thank you , no , " Marshal Shavyrin said . He glanced at the clock on the wall , then at Lorena . Pavel Bondarev saw , and made a tiny gesture of dismissal . Lorena left the room . Bondarev thought she closed the door heavily , but if so , Marshal Shavyrin did not notice it . " It is fantastic , " Shavyrin said . A hastily assembled report with bright red covers lay on Bondarev 's desk next to Bondarev 's ancient brass telescope . Shavyrin lifted the report and idly thumbed through the pages . " Fantastic , " he repeated . " I agree , " Bondarev said . " Yet we must believe  --  " The telephone chirped . Bondarev touched a button to put the telephone on amplifier . " Bondarcv . " " Petrovskiy. "  | " Da , Comrade Chairman ! " Bondarev said . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Good . You are well , Leonid Edmundovich ? " " Da , Comrade Chairman . " " Very well . General Bondarev , you have spoken with the American gen-erals ? " " Da . What they ask is barely possible , Comrade Chairman . " " Will it succeed ? " Bondarev looked helplessly at Shavyrin . The Marshal was silent for a moment , then said , " Comrade Chairman , who can know ? Yet it may be the only possible plan . The timing , however , is very critical . " " And your recommendation ? Do we do this ? " Shavyrin was silent . " Well ? " the Chairman demanded . " It is very critical , " Shavyrin said finally . " Part of their plan depends on their Pershing missiles . They are to fire them from Germany , to attack the alien spacecraft . Many of those missiles will come toward the Soviet Union . There will be no way to know their real targets  --  which might be Moscow or Kiev or our remaining missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whenever we have launched missiles , the aliens have bombarded the base from which they came . They will attack our remaining bases . Few strategic rocket forces will remain after this battle . If the Americans do not use their missiles , we will be disarmed and nearly helpless , and they will retain their strategic striking power . Supposethey do not launch their Pershing missiles , but keep them . They could destroy us within minutes , whenever they wanted , and we would be unable to retaliate . " Narovchatov 's voice came onto the line . " Is it your recommendation that we do not cooperate with the Americans ? " " No , Comrade First Secretary , " Shavyrin said . " But it is my duty to make you and the Chairman aware of all the implications . " " We have very little time , " Chairman Petrovskiy said . " The American President is waiting for my answer . He says the situation is desperate . I am inclined to agree . I must give him our decision now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If the Americans do not launch them  --  for any reason  --  then it is unlikely that our missiles will get through the enemy defenses . If the Americans are successful , then some of our missiles will reach their targets . " " Bondarev ? " the Chairman demanded . " I believe this may be our last chance . If we do not aid the Americans now , then the Americans will be defeated , and how long will it be before Russia falls to the aliens ? " " Your recommendation ? " " This is recorded . Not only the Chairman . The KGB will listen . If we.fail  --  " Comrade Chairman , I recommend that we aid the Americans , providedp242that they use their Pershing missiles , all of their Pershing missiles , in both England and Germany , to assist our penetration . " " You agree , Marshal Shavyrin ? " " Da , with those conditions , Comrade Chairman . " There was a long silence . Then the Chairman said , " Very well . I will inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for this attack . " There was another pause , then the Chairman 's voice came on again . " Academician and General of the Army Pavel Aleksandrovich Bondarev , and Marshal Leonid Edmundovich Shavyrin , I instruct you to take command of all strategic forces of the Soviet Union , including the submarine forces , and to employ them in aid of the battle plan code-named WHIRLWIND . If you jointly agree , you are authorized to use all of the forces in your command in aid of the American effort to drive the aliens from the planet . Is this understood ? " " Da , Comrade Chairman , " Shavyrin said . Pavel Bondarev gulped hard . " Da . "  |p243The  enemy of my enemy is my friend. - ARAB PROVERBCOUNTDOWN : H PLUS THREE WEEKSPavel Bondarev looked up at the big clock on his wall . " Ten minutes , " he said . Marshal Shavyrin grinned . " Da . You are nervous , Comrade ! " " Of course , " Bondarev said with irritation . " We are about to make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous ? " " Certainly , but you will permit that I do not openly join you ? I have known for five years that I might be faced with this moment . " " True , " Bondarev said . He looked at the twin electronics consoles installedagainst one wall of his underground office . Lights winked in complex patterns . In the lower right corner of each console was a switch . Bondarev patted his throat , to feel the key on its silver chain . " Does it make it easier ? " " The peasants say you can become accustomed to anything , even hanging , if you hang long enough  --  what was that ? " There were sharp sounds from outside . Bondarev went to the door . " No ! Do not open that door ! " Shavyrin commanded . He lifted his telephone . " Colonel ! What is the situation ? " He listened for a few moments . " They must not enter , " he snapped . " The cost does not matter . Our orders come from Chairman Petrovskiy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He put down the phone. liondarcv looked the question at him . ' ' Kdll , ' ' Shavyrin said . " " They have sent soldiers as well as their agents . My security forces are resisting them . "  | " But  --  " Pavel lifted the telephone . " Get me Chairman Petrovskiy  --  " Shavyrin shook his head . " Colonel Polivanov has already reported that the KGB has cut the telephone lines . We no longer have communications with Moscow . " Bondarev looked up in horror . " But  --  " Before he could speak , the door opened . Lorena came in . " What are you doing here ? " Bondarev demanded . She hesitated for a moment , then showed what was in her hand . She held a small automatic pistol . " You are both under arrest , in the name of State Security , " she said . " No ! " Bondarev shouted . " Not you ! " " The KGB is everywhere , " Shavyrin said . He reached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hysteria tinged her voice . " Comrade , I must speak to the rocket forces , " Shavyrin said . " To order them to aid the Americans , " she said . " Never !

The Americans are to launch "  --  he glanced at the clock on the wall  --  " even now are launching their Pershing missiles . Those missiles will come toward us . They are supposed to provide a diversion to allow our missiles to penetrate , but there is always the chance that the Americans will use this as an opportunity to attack us . With that in mind I have given orders that if the rocket forces do not hear from us , they will attack the United States . Not attack Kansas , but all of the United States ! " " I know nothing of this , " she shouted . " You will move there , to that wall , away from the desk , away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lorena , you can not do this . " He moved toward her . She backed away . " Stop ! I will shoot ! I will ! " Bondarev advanced . The little gun spat at him . He felt a sharp pain in his chest . " Lorena ! " he shouted . He swayed against the wall . She looked in horror . " Pavel , Pavel  --  " As she spoke , Marshal Shavyrin moved . He lifted the brass telescope from Bondarev 's desk and swung it , bringing it down on Lorena 's head , striking so hard that the telescope bent over her head and a lens fell onto the floor . She collapsed instantly . Shavyrin dropped the telescope and moved to close the door . Then he hurried to Bondarev . " Comrade , " he said . " Pavel  --  " Pavel heard him as from a distance . He tried to take a deep breath , but pain prevented him , and he heard blood burbling in his lungs . More shots sounded from outside in the corridors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bondarev said . Each word was an effort . He looked at the clock . " It is time ! We must know , did the Americans fire the Pershing missiles ? " Shavyrin lifted the telephone . " Polivanov . Shavyrin here . Colonel , did the Americans fire their Pershings ? " There was a long pause . " I see , " Shavyrinsaid . " Do we have communications with the strategic forces ? I see . Thank you . " He put the telephone down . " The KGB has cut us off from all reports from the West , " he said carefully . " Their spetsnaz troops came in such force that we could not hold all of this headquarters . My troops chose instead to defend the command circuits , which remain intact . " He pointed at the winking lights . " The keys will work , Comrade Academician . What do we do ? " Pavel breathed in short gasps . It hurt terribly . He collapsed in a chair in front of his console . " The Pershings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shavyrin said . " And from the sounds in the corridors , we do not have much more time . " As he spoke he unbuttoned the breast pocket of his uniform and took out a key . He looked at it for a moment , then inserted the key into his console and turned it . " You know more of these things than I , Pavel . I have armed my panel . It is your decision now . " Shavyrin drew his pistol and turned toward the door . " But I think you must decide quickly . " It felt as if his head was padded with cotton wool . Each breath hurt , and Shavyrin 's voice seemed to fade and return . What must I do ? We can not know , we can not know . Have the Americans tricked us ? Could the KGB be right ? Lorena lay on his Persian carpet . The broken brass telescope lay over her left arm , partly covering the expensive bracelet that Pavel had bought her . He could not see whether she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . Quickly ! Pavel fumbled with his shirt buttons . It seemed to take forever to open the links of the chain , and when he tried to jerk it off it would n't break . Patience  --  He opened the catch at last , and for a moment stared at the brass key ; then quickly and decisively he thrust it into the key switch and turned it . One by one the lights on the board blinked from green to red . " It is done , " Bondarev said . " Da , " Shavyrin said . There was a loud click as he released the safety catch of his pistol . There was something in the air . It affected all fithp differently . Spaceborn females only felt a nervousness , a wrongness ; they tended to snap back if approached wrongly . Sleepers were easily distracted ; they had to be heldp246to their duties . Even spaceborn males felt a belligerent optimism , as if their bodies wanted to dance or fight . Defensemaster Tantarent-fid had the air circulation running on high . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the human fithp might have known the difference among all the alien scents . The sleeper mating season had begun . The skewed mating seasons had come twice a year for fifteen years . The Herdmaster knew the feeling well , but he could n't help it : he felt good all over . The war was going well . Minor reversals had occurred on Winterhome , but the base was still in place . We learn . And this gathering will produce results . Pastempeh-keph did n't use the display room much , though his predecessorhad . It was too large for comfort . He had n't seen it since the history lesson , since the day Dawson attacked his own Breaker . He felt he needed it now . Message Bearer could run itself for a few hours , and screens would n't do . It must be a full gathering . He wanted to watch their body language . Seven fithp rested on their bellies in a circle : the Herdmaster , his Advisor , both Breakers , the Attackmaster , the Defensemaster , and Fistarteh-thuktun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " We are going to learn why the humans behave as they do . We will learn now . " Even Fathisteh-tulk looked uneasy ; and that was somehow gratifying . " Priorities first . Defensemaster , what is our status ? " Tantarent-fid was the youngest present . He was a smallish male , spaceborn , mated , father of two male children well below fighting age . He was not known to have dissident leanings . His predecessor , who did , had been retired while the Foot was departing the ringed giant . The Defensemaster 's business was the survival of the Traveler Herd . His domain included air systems , food sources , hull integrity , the main drive , course determinations , the mounted digit ships , and the lasers that would defend the ship from meteors or alien weapons . He shared these last three domains with the Attackmaster . He answered readily enough . " Message Bearer is fully able to defend itself , and well beyond attack range in any case . Main drive running well . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that will have to be replaced sometime . Sixteen digit ships moored for boost , and more returning from Winterhome . We 're on schedule . We 'll match with the Foot in two days . In twenty-two days we 'll have set the Foot on course , as you and **28;14341;TOOLONG may decide . We 'll disengage and leave Winterhome on a fast parabola . " " You have prey in the air ducts . " " Yes , the Breakers have had some success in training the human fithp . They show a gratifying agility . For two days now we 've had them cleaning and re-impregnating the filters . We had hoped that would take the mating scent out of the corridors , but  --  " Tantarent-fid clawed the air , perfunc/torily . " We 'll reserve the humans as backup to the automatic systems . The Breakers can best tell you whether they would react well during a real emergency . " " Good enough . Attackmaster Koothfektil-rusp , how 's the texture of the mud ? " The Attackmaster 's business was war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two , " he said . " Digit ships are in transit with prisoners and loot . If things continue to go well , we will not need the Foot ; but we must make that decision soon . " He paused , then , " We 've lost Digit Ship Twenty " How did you lose this digit ship ? " Koothfektil-rusp reared up on his forelegs . " Digit Ship Twenty was rising on a launch laser during heavy weather . We believe that the beam itself precipitated a funnel storm . The beam was blocked by clouds and debris . The ship rose too slowly ; the pilot tried to land . During that vulnerable period an aircraft fired a missile . " Some losses had to be expected , of course . Spaceborn had little grasp of planetary weather . Choose another topic  --  " Attackmaster , I have the impression that the prey continually repudiate their surrender . " " They do . " " Your response ? " The Attackmaster looked uncomfortable . " Which thuktun shall we read ? Fithp do not do such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where prey break their bond to the Traveler Herd . If a prey hides well enough to survive our wrath , we take him to be sane and harmless . But this is hard on my fithp , Herdmaster . It is hard to crush those who have surrendered ! " " I have my problems too . Breaker-One , is the Attackmaster 's approach correct ? " " I do n't  --  It wo n't teach them surrender , Herdmaster . Attackmaster Koothfektil-rusp has told us this : they attack after surrender , singly and in octuples and in still larger groups . This goes beyond an epidemic of rogues . It grows likely that the typical human resembles Dawson , and not the Soviets . They make their own decisions : each an entire fithp wobbling on two legs . Killing those who were not involved in a breach of faith . . . may accomplish nothing at all , or give them reason to question our sanity . " " Dawson . Fumf . " The Herdmaster considered . He must have answers . Was he even asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is futile . If all are insane  --  Advisor , you have been uncommonly silent . " " Lead me Herdmaster . Breaker-One , there is the matter of predictability . I f all are insane , are they all insane in the same fashion ? " " Not even that . I have no complaints of the Soviets . " But'I'akpusseh stirred , and Fathisteh-tulk caught it . " Breaker-Two ? " " They keep secrets . The Soviets speak their own language , though they practice the thuktun-speech too . They know more of the air ducts than wep248have asked them to learn . Ask us again after Digit Ship Six gives us more prisoners . " Fathisteh-tulk turned to another source . " Keeper of the thuktun , what have you learned ? The prey are described as insane . I remember the pflit of the Homeworld  --  " Speaking of the Homeworld to a fellow sleeper , Fistarteh-thuktun waxed loquacious . " Of course , the pflit reproduced at a furious rate . They were little mottled gray beasts the same colors as the Sunward Forest they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look roguish . An individual life meant nothing in the survival strategy of the pflit , so they evolved no defense against predators , and they migrated in swarms , even if the path led off a cliff . . . What insight are you seeking ? The prey throw their lives away , but they do n't breed faster than we do . " " Probably true , " Takpusseh said . " You miss my point , " The Advisor said . " Is it not true that nature shapes life to fit its style of life ? " We 're wasting time , Pastempeh-keph thought , but he was n't sure and he did n't speak . A Herdmaster must trumpet softly , lest a suggestion be taken for an order . " The Life Thuktun tells us so , " Fistarteh-thuktun said slowly . " The Thuktun of the Long Path shows how new forms arise from old . Evolution goes by groups , by herds ; but ripper fthuggl live alone , attacking their prey one on one : all rogues . They need room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender in herds , or accept surrender into the victor herd . What style of life has shaped our prey ? The prey  --  they do n't surrender to superior force . Perhaps they die to guard genes related to theirs . Or  --  " " Think of a hunting carnivore , " Takpusseh said in sudden excitement . " Food is scarce , so they scatter . Siblings might be hundreds of miles away . More dangerous predators come . Might a prey die to kill them , because the marauders might reach its genotypes ? " " But humans are omnivores , " Raztupisp-minz reminded them . " Still , the sky of Winterhome seethed with aircraft before our attack . I think you have it . They do not remain in families . Like ripper fthuggl , individuals go to make their own territory . To kill something dangerous is for the good of all . For surviving heroes it may even mean mating privileges , to judge by our studies of their broadcasts . We believe that they have no specific mating season . Indeed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herdmaster called them back to specifics . " What does this do for us , if true ? " Into the uneasy silence Fathisteh-tulk said , " It makes us aware of the awesome magnitude of our problem . We take surrender in herds , do we ? Our prey does n't come in herds ! A family might be scattered across half the planet ! " " Surely  --   |p249Whatever  the Attackmaster was about to say would never be heard . His digits flipped back to cover his skull  --  the classic reflexive response to threat  --  as he listened to the shell-shaped phone under his earflap . It is not good news . The Herdmaster waited . If there were danger to the ship , both he and the Defensemaster would know instantly . What could be important enough to interrupt this meetingHe knew soon enough . The Attackmaster took a microphone from his harness . " Flee . Save what we can . " He returned the microphone . " Herdmaster , we no longer have a base in Kansas . " " How is this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the orbitingdigit ships  --  " " But these can be stopped . " " Stopped , of course . But more bombs fall on our base , and our ships are too busy to stop them . Bombs are rising from both land masses and from the sea . " " From both land masses ? " The Advisor looked thoughtful . " You are certain ? " " I am certain of nothing , Advisor . They sow radioactive fire on their own croplands ! Herdmaster , I must  --  " " Certainly . " The Herdmaster stood , releasing his fithp to their duties . They scattered . " What now ? " he demanded . " What do you make of this ? " Advisor Fathisteh-tulk struck at invisible flies . " I would not tread on the Breakers ' ground  --  " " Your advice , drown you ! " " Soviets and Dawson 's tribe cooperate . When they must . As we hear of our losses , we must not forget this . Go fight your war . " He spoke to the Herdmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . For two days there had been cornfields and no sign of war . Rosalee was stretched out , taking advantage of the now roomy backseat of the Rabbit . Road conditions had been mixed , good roads alternating with stretches where the highways and intersections were utterly destroyed . It 's still a long way to Colorado Springs . There 's nothing on the radio , and I 'm half asleep . Roger asked , " Carol , are you slept out ? " She had n't spoken in hours . Her eyes were wide , doing a continual slow swivel . She jumped when he spoke and said , " Yeah . I must say , that 's the damnedest convention I ever half saw . " " I believe it . "  | " Though I heard about one in St. Louis that was canceled , and nobody told the Guest of Honor . " " Why do you go ? " " Oh . . . mostly we go to meet each other , I guess . And the people who write the books we read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three men for every two women , and the ratio used to be even better . And fun things tend to happen , like the masquerades and listening to the dirty filk-songs- " Filksongs ? " " And half a dozen writers going off to dinner , with an editor to pay , and Nat taking me along . And the room parties , and the elevator parties , and smoffing . . . damn . " She was crying . " I guess I 'm in mourning . " " I 'm sorry about George . But he did get a tank . I do n't think anyone could have stopped him . " Did she blame Roger ? Apparently not . " George . I thought that was stupid , I told him so .. . George . " Her head was turned away , watching the passing cornfields . She broke a long silence in a sudden rush of words . " It 'll never happen again . It 's all dead ! The publishing industry is probably dead , half of science fiction is obsolete , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years to come , and how can you hold a convention with no airlines ? " She misses science fiction . If the best troops in the Army ca n't drive the aliens out , the whole damn planet is doomed , and she misses science fiction . It came to him , suddenly and frighteningly , that the war might already be lost . " That first night Nat had a three-pound Lobster Savannah , and he started talking to it . Hospital Station thinks they can cure you . ' The Federation does n't think your people can defend themselves alone . ' Now will you speak of your troop movements , wretched crustacean ? ' By dessert we were calling him Speaker to Seafood  --  " Her voice changed . " Oh my God ! " The corner of Roger 's eye had caught light brighter than sunlight . He braked without looking . " What is it ? " " They 're hitting us again ! " He eased the Rabbit over to the dirt rim of the highway before he dared look . One glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door and slid out , low . " Follow me . Rosalee , wake up and get out on my side ! Stay low ! " The blast came , not as bad as he had expected , followed by a wind , followed by another blast and more wind . The Rabbit 's windows rattled . By then all three were crouched on the highway side of the car . There were more bright lights high overhead , and another to the north . When the light died a little , Roger peeked over the hood . Fiery mushrooms bloomed amidst the Kansas wheat fields . " Mushrooms . I think this is the real thing , " he said . " Not meteors . Atomic bombs , and that 's occupied territory . Those are ours . " " Bombing Kansas ? "  |p251Roger  laughed , and meant it . " If you 've got a better idea , you should have been in the helicopter . At least we 're fighting back ! " He peeked again . There were four fire-mushrooms in view , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light rose from hundreds of miles away .. . something was blocking it at the skyward end , something rising . . . another fireball winked near the base of the beam . Roger ducked fast , waited , looked again . Fireball rising . No laser beam . An orange point high up , drifting down . What was that all about ? Whatever . Lasers were aliens , atomic bombs were men , and the bomb had interrupted something . " Come on , guys , " Roger gloated . " Ruin their whole morning ! "  |p255The  destiny of mankind is not decided by material computation . When great causes are on the move , we learn that we are spirits , not animals , and that something is going on in space and time , and beyond space and time , which , whether we like it or not , spells duty.  --  WINSTON CHURCHILL , Rochester , New York , 1941COUNTDOWN : H. PLUS FOUR WEEKSWestern Kansas was a black , dimpled land . The army pilot gave the craters a wide berth , flying carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he spoke seldom . His motions were jerky . He could n't have seen films of death-beams spiraling in on other helicopters , but rumors must have spread . Jenny guessed that he was waiting to be speared by green light . Sitting beside her , Jack Clybourne was as calm as an oyster . Jenny saw reports from the observatories as they came in , and she kept no secrets from Jack . Earth 's most recent moons still included more than a score of destroyer-sized spacecraft ; but the mother ship had disappeared Into interplanetary space with half its retinue , and the remaining ships seemed to be doing nothing . Waiting ? If the pilot had known what Jenny knew , he might be calmer . But the vivid green death was still possible . Jenny was n't as calm as she looked . Jack Clybourne was Jenny 's own true love , but he was not about to out-macho her . From time to time , at Jenny 's orders , the pilot skimmed low over burned cornhclds and along broken roads . The roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloths in neon-bright colors , and thousands of dinner-plate-sized pieces of flattened foam plastic . The hanggliderfabric would become clothing , come winter , for refugees who would he glad to have it . But the alien landing shoes would he indestructible litter.  |p256A  hundred years from now farmers would still be digging them up in the cornfields . Would those farmers have hands , or bifurcated trunks ? There were black skeletons of automobiles , and corpses : enough halfburnedhuman and alien corpses to satisfy anybody . The helicopter circled a village , and Jenny could n't find a single unburned structure . The inhabitants had fled ahead of the aliens , and the aliens had fled from fission bombs , and nobody remained to fight the fires . Rarely , bands of refugees looked up to watch the helicopter pass . Few tried to wave it down . Jenny 's eyes kept straying to the alien ship . It had been in sight for nearly an hour . Less than ten miles away now , it dominated the flat black landscape . It had fallen several miles . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battleship dropped on its nose . It must have loomed large in the refugees ' eyes . Like a coyote on a freeway , a fi ' corpse lay in the road , flattened to a pancake silhouette and rotted almost to its crushed bones . Its hang glider had n't opened . She 'd seen dead snouts here and there . They stripped their dead , but often left them where they lay . Cremation would have been easy enough : stack the bodies , and one blast of a fithp laser would do it . The helicopter settled near the stern . Jenny and Jack got out . They walked alongside the ruined hull . Only the warship 's tail , an outsize rocket-nozzle-shape with jet scoops facing forward , had survived the crash intact . The hull had split halfway along its length . Jack chinned himself on the edge of the rip . " Nothing . A fuel tank . " Forward of the tank wall , the hull had wrinkled and torn again . From the bent nose a glassless window winked , the opening squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they climbed inside , Jack leading the way . They came out faster than they went in . Jenny took off the gas mask and waited . Jack Clybourne ran into the cornfield . After a few moments she heard sounds of gagging . She tried not to notice . " Sorry , " he said when he came back . " Sure . I almost lost my lunch too . " " First assignment I get Outside  --  " " You have n't done any harm , " Jenny said . " We 're not likely to do any good here , either . The ship 's a mess , it 's a job for experts . " " Experts . " He looked at the wreckage . " You 'd send your dreamers-forhireinto that ? " " It 's their job . " Jack shook his head . He said , " Well , it 's for sure there were n't any sur-vivors . " " Yes . Too bad . " " Damn straight . Jeez , you 'd think they 'd have left some of their troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuate . Just in case , " Jenny said.  | " Maybe they planned it that way . Maybe they did just what they came for . Kansas is gone . This place is a wound , a cemetery . We 've got no dams , no highways , no railroads , and we 're afraid to fly . And we 've got one prisoner . Ilow many of our people did they get ? " Jenny shook her head . " I do n't know . A lot , from the missing persons reports . But we ca n't rely on those . " We 're stalling , she thought . " Look , I 've got to go back in . Alone . No need for both of us to get sick . " " No . I wanted to come . I was n't doing any good inside the Hole . " Clybourneput on the gas mask . " Rrready . " His voice sounded hollow from inside the mask . They reentered the rip in the life support system . The interior was twisted and bent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alien bodies lay in the corridors . They stank . Too many days had passed since the combined U.S. and Soviet bombardment had driven the aliens back to space . Alien bodies had bloated and/or ruptured . Jenny tried to ignore them ; they were someone else 's job . She hoped the biologists would come soon to remove them . Not that I know what I 'm looking for . She went deeper into the ship . Her flashlight picked out the remains of equipment ; wherever she pointed , Jack took photographs . The whine of the recharger for his electronic flash sounded loud in the dead ship . Nothing was intact . There ca n't be anything here , or they 'd have melted it from space . Would n't they ? How do they regard their dead ? I 'll have to ask Harpanet . Get Reynolds to ask him , she corrected herself . The science-fiction writers seemed to spend all their time with the captured alien ; and Jenny could n't face one , not after this . A large steel door lay ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crash . Jenny pulled and it moved slightly . She was n't strong enough to move it farther . Jack slung the camera over his shoulder and took a grip on the door . When they pulled together it opened just far enough to let them squeeze by . The room was tremendous , with a low ceiling and a padded floor that was now a wall . It was filled with death . For a moment she did n't recognize what she saw . Then her flashlight played across a human face , a child 's face , sweetly smiling  --  she was relieved to see that it was a doll . There was a white bloated thing wrapped in bright colored tartan under the doll . Jenny moved closer until her light showed what the doll rested on . Like a find-the-face puzzle : now her eyes found human shapes , a knee , the back of a head , a man folded in two around a snapped spine ; but all piled together like melting clay . They must have been jammed in like cattle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with human and snout features , until it snapped into focus . An alien guard must have struck like a bomb when the ship came down , and at least three prisoners had been under him.  |p258She  gagged , and bile filled her mouth , splashed against the gas mask . Reflexively she lifted the mask . The smells of death filled her lungs . She turned and ran from the ship . The bridge hummed with soft voices . Behind Message Bearer a glow was fading , dying . Its death was carefully monitored . One could n't turn the main drive on and off like a light switch , lest showers of lethal particles burst from the magnetic bottle and spray through the ship . Puffballs of flame streamed from sixteen digit ships mounted along the aft rim , fine-tuning Message Bearer 's velocity . Bridge personnel watched the view from a sensor pod that reached out from the hull like a big-headed metal snake . Pastempeh-keph watched the screens , letting it happen . His fithp could manage this without his help . Thrust shifted him against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black-and-gray mass approach his ship . The Foot was woefully changed . Within the outer fringe of the gas giant 's ring they had found a roughsurfacedwhite egg , two makasrupkithp along the long axis , against a backdropof terrible beauty . It had been like something out of the Shape Wars , a heretical representation of the Predecessors : a featureless head , lacking digits and body , lacking everything but brain . The mining team had chosen it for its size and composition , out of an eight-cubed of similar moonlets . Over the next ten Homeworld years its icy strata had hatched water and air and fuel ; its rock-and-metal core gave up steel alloys , and soil additives for the garden section . It was no longer an egg . Six-eighths of its mass was gone . The ice was gone , leaving ridges and gouges and runnels and pits in a makasrupk-long nugget of black slag . A faceless alien head had become an asymmetrical alien skull . It drifted closer now , an ugly omen . " I hoped that we could shunt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the option , " said his Advisor . " If the prey had proved tractable , our present foray might have become a base of operations . We might have taken Winterhome without the Foot . " Pastempeh-keph trumpeted in sudden rage . " Why do they always wait to attack ? " " It 's not a serious question , Herdmaster . " Fathisteh-tulk was placid as always . " We organized our foray over the past several years . Why would they not take a few eights of days to gather their forces ? So . Now they have used fission bombs on their own Garden regions , and I must admit that that seems excessive  --  " " Mad . " " Mad , then . If they are truly mad , our problem is worse yet . Give thanks that it is the Breakers ' problem , not ours , not yet . "  | " It will be soon . " " Yes . But Digit Ship Six approaches with new prisoners and a considerablemass of loot . The Breakers should learn a great deal when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , was as expected . Nothing else is . " Why have the natives not sent messages ? " " Before there was anything to say , they wanted to talk , " Fathisteh-tulk said . " Now that we have some estimation of our relative strengths , they say nothing . No demands , no offers . Twelve digit ships are destroyed , and vast stretches of cropland , and the prey 's herdmasters have nothing to say to us . Perhaps the Breakers will learn why . " Again , that overly placid , languid , irritating voice . There is nothing to be done , the Herdmaster told himself . He is Advisor . What would I do , in his place ? Message Bearer surged backward , and shuddered . A fi ' turned and said , " Herdmaster , we are mated to the Foot . Soon we may begin acceleration . Have we a course ? " This was the moment . Long ago the Predecessors had destroyed a planet . Now  --  " Continue the Plan . Guide the Foot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find us a more specific target . " He stiffened suddenly . In a lowered voice he said , " Fathisteh-tulk , I believe I forgot to do anything about the mudroom ! " " Phoo . Defensemaster  --  " " I saw to it that the mudroom was fully frozen before we stomped our spin , " Tantarent-fid said complacently . " I evacuated your private mudroom too , Herdmaster . " " Good . Well served . " Pastempeh-keph shuddered at a mental picture : globules of mud filling the air , fithp in pressure suits trying to sweep it awayLack of a communal mudroom would cause its own problems . Henceforthevery fi ' would be vaguely unhappy  --  as if the skewed mating seasons were not enough . He lifted his snffp high . I drown in a flood of troubles . Fathisteh-tulk made sympathetic gestures . Not sympathy . Answers . " Defensemaster , bring the Breakers , the Attackmaster , and the priest to the conference pit . We must make decisions regardingthe prey and the Foot . " " Attackmaster ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Digit ships are in transit with prisoners and loot . We lost Digit Ship Thirteen , which carried the bulk of what we had gathered , but we saved several prisoners and some material on other ships . " " How was this one lost ? " Koothfektil-rusp 's digits snapped back to cover his head . Did he feel threatened ? " We did not anticipate that the American 1-lerd would bomb their own major food-hearing domain ! We did not anticipate that the Sovietp260Herd would cooperate with them ; and that they surely did ! Our beams stopped many of their suborbital bombs , but many got through , and the launch devices had moved before we could fire on them . " " The ship ? " " Thirteen was rising on a launch beam when a thermonuclear missile from a submarine vehicle destroyed the laser facility . " " The bombs : were they all from the Soviet Herd ? " " From desert territories on the Soviet continent , and from offshore of the American continent , from submarine vehicles that were shielded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices came from the United States itself . " The Herdmaster pondered that . " Breaker-One , must we assume that the United States Herd has surrendered to the other ? Or has the Soviet Herd attacked our foothold in Kansas , risking their wrath ? " Raztupisp-minz glanced at Takpusseh before speaking . " You must also consider that two human herds may cooperate when neither has surrendered to the other . " The Herdmaster had feared this . Too many answers were no answer . " And yet we may prosper , " Attackmaster Koothfektil-rusp said soothingly . " There is little industry , little transportation in our chosen target area . We may find genotypes clustered when we land following Footfall . " " Footfall , yes . " Keep to specifics . " Must the Foot fall ? Breaker-One ? " Raztupisp-minz said , " They must be made to know that they are hurt . " Takpusseh stirred but kept silent . " Hurt ? In America they will starve ! They have seared their crops with radioactive fire ! " The Herdmaster took firm hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seven spaceborn males were ready to butt heads ! " Attackmaster ? The Foot ? " Koothfektil-rusp 's answer was predictable . " Stomp them . Show our might . We have chosen the location , Herdmaster . This time we attack a weaker herd . We must secure a foothold on Winterhome , and expand from there . Weather following Footfall will make retaliation difficult . Fate gifts us with a side effect : the weather worldwide will be wetter and more to our liking . " " Show me . " Koothfektil-rusp lit the wall screen . Under his direction a globe of Winterhomerolled , and stopped . The Attackmaster 's digit indicated the body of water that Rogachev called the Indian Ocean . " Here , in the center . Look how the waves expand from the impact point . East , they roll many makasrupkithpto the island nations . North , even further . Westward , they cover the lowlands where we see city lights ; the highlands are left free . Northwest , fuel sources that serve worldwide industry are drowned . These herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage herds of the Southern Hemisphere , and wild air masses make transport impossible to them , and where would they send their forces ? We might land east or westp261or north ; the rolling sea subdues the prey in all directions . My sleeper aides tell me that the Foot has the mass and velocity to do the work we want . " They would drown , by eight to the eighths . The Herdmaster mourned in advance . " Have you chosen our foothold ? " " Here , I think . We would find not only mines but possible allies . One problem , Herdmaster : launching facilities will be a problem , here or anywhere . We must build in continual rain . Perhaps we must launch through rain , requiring more laser power , making a launch more conspicuous ... " The Herdmaster felt himself relaxing . He knew military strategy . This was easier than talking about the craziness of the prey , which made his mind hurt . Advisor Fathisteh-tulk vented a fluttering snort . " Possible allies ? " His digits swiped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attackmaster snapped back . " They have little transportation ! We will find true herds . When they surrender  --  " The Herdmaster was tired . " Enough . Do it your way , Attackmaster . I 've heard no better suggestion . Breakers , keep me aware . We must understand the prey ; we must teach them our way . To your duties . " He waited while the rest scattered . Then , " Fathisteh-tulk , you know planet dwellers better than we . " Have we erred ? Could we win without the Foot ? A Herdmaster could not ask . The Advisor repeated what Breaker-One had said . " They must know that they have been hurt . Whether that will be enough . . . Herdmaster , can you spare me now ? " " Go , Fathisteh-tulk .

Surely there would be cameras . He had thought the cameras would be hard to identify , but they were not . Nikolai located a brush-rimmed ring of just the right size to fill a duct . It was in a recess , not moving . There were glass eyes at opposite points , and a metal tentacle coiled around the inner surface . A cleaning robot . During the next few days they looked for others . Occasionallyone would be seen far down a tube . It was comforting to know that they were watched  --  and how . " Show your stamina , " Takpusseh had said . Dawson would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted him out of his cell . They had not seen him for days . Dmitri and Arvid and Nikolai stopped when they were tired , but before they were exhausted , four days in a row . Today was the fifth day , and it was time to move . A ring-shaped duct cleaner was far behind them , rolling on ball bearings in the outer rim . Arvid and Dmitri moved side by side , close together . They had become good at that . Nikolai was ahead of them . Perhaps the cameras would not see him . Perhaps he would be seen but not observed : in the waving of alien limbs , three humans might well seem to be two . If another duct cleaner appeared ahead , Dmitri would say , casually , " Another time . " None did . Nikolai spotted a side duct ahead . He speeded up . Taking his cue , Arvid and Dmitri speeded up too . The curve of the corridor had left the duct cleaner behind when Nikolai disappeared , axis-bound . Arvid stopped to clean out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he caught up to Dmitri . The Rabbit topped a final rise . Pikes Peak had been visible ahead for hours ; now they could see its base . The city of Colorado Springs lay spread out in the valley below them . " We 're here , " Roger said . " Now what ? " Carol asked . " Are you sure Nat is here ? Will he want to see me ? " " Yes , and I do n't know , " Roger said . " What will we do ? " Rosales asked  |p263With  a possessive tone . Why is it that women get that tone when they 've been sleeping with you ? And that men respond to it ? But I 'm glad I met her . " There are bound to be newspapers . The Washington Post still exists . It might even have a Colorado Springs headquarters . I 'll be welcome there . So will you , if I bring you in . " " I can type , " Rosalee said . " And maybe I can help in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . She 's smart . Not very pretty , but there 's something about her  --  " Sure . We 'll work together . Reporters need research assistants . " " Where will Nat Reynolds be ? " Carol asked . " I want to see him . " He 'll be Inside , and I 've told you that a dozen times , so why the hell are youasking me again ? " We 'll see . " He started the car down toward the city center . " It 's all so damned  --  different , " Carol said . " Yeah . That 's for sure , " Rosalee agreed . " Maybe it will always be dif-ferent. "  |p264Who  travels alone , without lover or friend , But hurries from nothing , to naught at the end. - ELLA WHEELER WILCOXCOUNTDOWN : H PLUS FIVE WEEKSDigit Ship Six was moored in place at Message Bearer 's stern . While fuel flowed into the digit ship , Chintithpit-mang 's eight-squared , now reduced to forty-one , moved through the airlock and forward along the mating tube . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeoff , warriors checking their cell had found the air stinking with the smell of half-digested food . They must have been breathing the stuff until the air flow pulled it out . In free-fall they were like fish out of water . They acted like they were dying . Chintithpit-mang 's warriors had to tow them like baggage . They towed other baggage : food stocks , maps , books full of pictures , tape cassettes , and projection machines . Chintithpit-mang himself moved clumsily . One leg was braced straight , and it interfered with his every motion . A thermonuclear device had explodednear the ship just before takeoff . Chintithpit-mang and six prisoners had slammed against a wall . The prisoners , with their negligible mass , were barely bruised , but Chintithpit-mang 's right hind leg had snapped under him . Two octuples of warriors met them at the end of a makasrupk of tunnel . They all looked irritatingly clean and healthy . Chintithpit-mang was glad to turn his prisoners over to them . If any died , he preferred that another have them in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate would be waiting.  |p265Humans  in a corridor startled him . He was reaching for his gun before he realized that they must be prisoners . They seemed to want something ... He glared at them and kept moving . The next corner brought him face to face with Fathisteh-tulk . Had the Herdmaster 's Advisor noticed ? " May your time stretch long , Advisor , " he said , and would have passed . " Stay , " said Fathisteh-tulk . " I need you . " Chintithpit-mang suppressed a fluttering snort of displeasure , but the Advisor sensed it anyway . " This is of massive importance , and none other will do , " he persisted . " You are of the Year Zero Fithp , and a dissident . So is your mate . She will assume that your duties kept you at the ship until you can explain to her . Come . " Dmitri and Arvid climbed wearily from the air duct . Two female fithp looked at the Soviets and passed on . A passing if warrior trumpeted anger at them ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ? I thought they had their instructions  --  " " He may have had other instructions , " Arvid said . " No . He was injured . A ship must have arrived from Earth  --  that series of thuds this morning  --  " " Da . Injured warriors will not like humans . " The next fi ' warrior seemed friendly enough . Perhaps he was glad of a touch of strange in his life . He made conversation , and the Soviets answered in kind . He dawdled for the benefit of the tired duct-cleaners , who moved a little more slowly than necessary . Hide your strength ! The Herdmaster looked up from his viewscreen and snorted angrily . His digits pounded a baseball-sized button . " Communications , get me Fathisteh-tulk . Find out why he is n't on duty . " " Will you talk to him yourself ? " " No . Send him here . Has Digit Ship Six arrived ? " " It arrived while you slept , Herdmaster . " " After you have the Advisor , get me Breaker-One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ? Never mind . Get me Breaker-One . " The screen showed Raztupisp-minz looking as if his youth had returned . Power could do that for an aging fi ' . He had had power while breaking the sleepers to their new role . Now his human charges had given him his authority back . " We will put the new prisoners to distributing the dietary supplements , " he said , " and let them talk with the Soviets , with Tashayamp present . First , however , I intend to house them with Dawson . Dawson has been alonep266for several days now . We hoped that , like a newborn meatflyer , he would fixate on me if he had no other companionship . " " Did it work ? " " It is too soon to tell , but I think not . Dawson is not newborn . He talks to me , but not as a new slave talks to one who has taken his surrender . There is anger if not impudence . Herdmaster , I wonder if there is a surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He surrendered . He must be made to know the implications . " " At your orders  --  " " Drown you , your task is not within my thuktun ! I advise only . You will do what you can , in whatever way you feel is good , and you will accept full responsibility for failure ! " " Lead me , Herdmaster . Companions from Dawson 's herd may give him back his rationality . " " Your scarlet-tufted female was considered a curable rogue . Will her presence in Dawson 's cell affect Dawson 's sense of reality ? " " Alice accepted surrender . She obeys orders . Eight-cubed leader Siplistephsays she seems saner than most . " " Keep me informed . Are the air ducts clean ? " Raztupisp-minz bridled at his sarcastic tone . " The prisoners have covered perhaps six sixty-fourths of the network . They 're doing well . Herdmaster , you are aware that a battle might destroy the duct sweepers or rip the ducts open . The humans are gaining practice against real need . " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indeed being broken to the Traveler Herd . " Breaker-One hesitated . Then , " They do not interpret orders rigorously . One has explored regions to which he was not assigned . This may demonstratethe curiosity native to a climbing species , or they may hope to gain knowledge that will make them of more benefit to us  --  " " Still they do not obey . Carry on . " The Herdmaster broke contact . " Get me Chowpcentulk . " If he knew Chowpeentulk , she would know where her mate was under almost any circumstances . Communications tracked her to the infirmary , where Chowpeentulk was in the act of delivering an infant . Even a Herdmaster had to wait sometimes . The cell door was ajar ; it opened to Wes Dawson 's touch . He pushed it shut with his feet , and heard the lock click . Thoughts and memories boiled in his head . He pushed them deep into his mind , concentrating on the pain in his leg , and on not appearing injured . The fithp are not telepathic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was large and lonely . He had lived there for five days now . He liked the elbow room and he had n't liked dealing with the Soviets . Nonetheless  --  They 're punishing me . But for what ? It must be punishment . To a herd beast , being left in solitary must he agony.  |p267They  want to break me . I wo n't let them . Think of something . What ? There 's nothing to read .. . Thuktun Flishithy 's main drive was a universal subliminal hum in Dawson'smind . Its source was a gnawing ache . It must be pushing against an enormous mass , for the acceleration to be so low . The fithp must have a hell of a big reserve of deuterium-tritium mix . That 's an ominous thought . It 's a big ship , and it can fight . It has to be D-T mix . Any other assumption is worse . A fusion motor using simple hydrogen would have to be far more sophisticated , halfway from science fiction to fantasy . Wes Dawson preferred a more optimistic assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door opened . The intruder wailed as she entered . She had bright red hair and a paleface that would have been pretty if she had n't looked so sick . She was slenderas a pipe cleaner , fragile-looking . Free-fall was making her terribly unhappy . Wes caught her arm . The newcomer wailed at him without seeing him . Others came into the cell . A blond girl , no more than ten years old , floated gracefully to remove his hand from the slender woman 's arm . " It'sall right , Alice , " the girl said . " Makes me sick , oh God , I 'm faaalllinggg . . . New prisoners . Not astronauts . My God , they 've invaded Earth ! The thinfacedredhead screamed again , and the blond girl said something soothing . Wes pushed woman and girl toward a wall , recoiled from the opposite wall , and was with them before they could bounce away . He pushed the woman 's hands into the rug surface until she got the idea : her fists closed tight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he could look at the others . There were four more . One was a boy of nine or so , black-haired , darkly tanned . Two were in their fifties , weathered like farm people , unmistakably man and wife from the way they clung to each other . The final one was probably the blond girl 's mother . She had the same shade of blond hair and the same finely chiseled nose . She floated at arm 's length , like an acrobat . The blond woman looked at him hard . " Wes Dawson ? Senator ? " Did she expect him to recognize her ? He did n't . He smiled at her . " Congressman . Which way did you vote ? " " Jeri Wilson . We met at JPL , fifteen years ago , when the Voyager was passing Saturn . . . . Uh , Republican . " A long time ago . She could n't have been more than twenty then . Maybe not that old . And he 'd met a lot of people since . " Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get here ? " " We were captured  --  " " Sure , but where ? "  | " You do n't know ? " Jeri asked . " Oh . I guess you would n't . We were captured in Kansas . The aliens invaded . " " Kansas  --  where in Kansas ? " " Not far from your wife 's home , " Jeri said . " About forty miles from there  --  " " How the devil do you know where my wife is staying ? " Dawson demanded . " We were on our way there , " Jeri said . " Do you believe in synchronicity ? I do n't , not really , but  --  well , actually it 's not too big a surprise . Nothing is , now . " Wes shook his head in confusion . Aliens in Kansas . " Why were you going to find Carlotta ? " " It 's a long story , " Jeri said . " Look , we were going west , getting out of Los Angeles , when we ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Harry Reddington  --  " " Hairy Red ? You know him ? " " Yes . He tried to help us , and when  --  when that did n't do any good , he was trying to go help your wife , and he took us with him , only the aliens landed  --  " " All right , " Wes said . " I can get the details later . Is Carlotta all right ? " " I do n't know . Something happened in Kansas . Something bad for the snouts , because first they were happy , and then all of a sudden our guards turned mean . " " Snouts ? " " That 's what everyone calls them now . " " Good name . " He turned to the others . " Did n't mean to ignore you . You must have a lot of questions ? " " Some , " the man said . " Reckon the Lord will tell us what we have to know , " the woman added . She put a protective arm around the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From Kansas , but they did n't see any more of the war than I did . And Gary Capehart . They left his parents behind . We do n't know why . And that 's my daughter Melissa , and her friend there is Alice . What 's going to happen to us ? " " Good question . I wish I knew . What 's wrong with Alice ? " The redhead 's face was pressed tight into the wall padding , and her back was stiff . Jeri said , " She would n't tell us her last name . She said a bomb hit Menninger 's and they all ran . You know Menninger 's ? She must have been a patient . " Carrie Woodward sniffed , loudly . The voice came muffled . " Free wing . " Wes said , " I beg your pardon ? " The small face turned halfway . " I was on the free wing . No locked doors . You know what that means ? I was n't one of the really sick ones , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I was getting lonely . " He did n't try to shake hands . None could have spared a hand ; they were all clinging to the dubious security of the wall rug . " Are n't there others ? " " We thought so , " Jeri said . " But we have n't seen any . Are  --  you the only one alive from Kosmograd ? " " No , there are some Russians . The fithp  --  that 's what they call themselves , and you 'll have to learn their language  --  the fithp sometimes keep us together and sometimes separate us . There are a pair of them in charge of teaching us . " " Teachin ' what ? " Carrie Woodward asked . Her voice was filled with suspicion . " Language . Customs . People , they will expect you to surrender . Formally . Sooner or later Takpusseh or Raztupisp-Minz  --  one of our fi ' teacherswill come here and expect you to roll over on your back , and he 'll put his foot on your chest . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They already did that , " Melissa said . Jeri laughed . " We were scared silly . But really , why would they wait till now ? We 'd just float away . " " Once that 's done , they expect you to cooperate . Not just passively . " " You mean they think we 're one of them now ? " Melissa asked . " Something like that , " Dawson agreed . He pointed casually to the large camera in one corner of the room . " They have no sense of privacy , " he said . " They watch us when they please . " Jeri Wilson frowned . John Woodward looked at the camera , then seemed to hunch into himself . He does n't look good . Like Giorge did ... . " It is n't right , " Woodward said . His wife nodded agreement . " Maybe , but that 's how it is , " Dawson said . " Okay , " Jeri said . " So we learn to act like snouts  --  " " And learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . Jeri said , " Hah ! No . " Alice said , " Oh , " and reached into her blouse and pulled out a big vitamin bottle . The pills were big too , and the label was a book 's worth of tiny print , listing thirty-odd vital nutrients and their sources : bee pollen , cornfrey , dandelion , fennel , hawthorne berry , ginger , garlic ... Fo-Ti , Dong Quai ... Siberian ginseng , rose hips .. . " You raided a health food store ? " Alice said , " Yeah . They took me through a grocery and a health food store and made me point at things I thought we 'd need . Any objections ? " " Not bloody likely . " He swallowed a fat pill with greenish flecks in it , dry . " ' There 's some food from the Soviet station , and the fithp grow some things we can cat if you close your eyes first , but I 've been worrying about vitamins . " " What was it like ? " Jeri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  "  |p270He  told it long . It did n't look like anything would interrupt them for a while . " Your turn , " Dawson said . Alice was n't eager to talk until she got started . " We were in the basement , along the walls . It was just like a tornado scare . They crowd all the patients in , in any order , mixed in with the orderlies . It 's the only time you see the ones on the locked wing . . . . Anyway , there was a terrific noise and some of the walls fell in . Anyone who could still stand up ran away screaming , even some of the orderlies . I just ran . I got into the zoo next door and hid in the mammal house , but there was n't any place to hide , really . James came in and I told him to go away , but he would n't . When the horrors came in I thought some of the zoo animals had got loose . " The aliens had moved through Topeka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They took books and magazines from libraries and drugstores : anything with pictures . They led the prisoners through a supermarket and various small stores . Jeri and Melissa and the Woodwards had refused to cooperate , but Alice tried to assemble a collection of fresh and canned food , vitamins and mineral supplements " Did you have a chance to get coffee ? " " Hell , no , I did n't get cigarettes either . Bad for you . I got some herb teas , though . " And when Dawson laughed she looked furious . The images on the video screen faded . Raztupisp-minz continued to stare at it , as if that would bring meaning to what he had seen . Finally he turned . " What do you believe this means ? " he asked . Takpusseh 's digits flared . " The Herdmaster will not be amused , " Raztupisp-minz hissed . He glanced at the camera in one corner . " Perhaps he has seen already . " " His annoyance will be as nothing when Fistarteh-thuktun sees these recordings , " Takpusseh said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have curious courtship and mating habits . Apparently the females are continuouslyin estrus , and do not care what male satisfies their urges . " " Then how do the females control them ? " Raztupisp-minz demanded . " It can not be possible  --  " " Much is possible , " Takpusseh sighed , " Forgive me , grandson , but you have seen only life aboard ship . You have never lived on a world rich with life . " " They eat their own kind ! And sing as they do ! I do not care to live on such a world . " " If that is what we saw , " Takpusseh said . " We must ask the prisoners . " " Does Dawson speak well enough ? "  | " No . Nor do I know their speech so well . But Tashayamp does . She hasbeen studying . " Takpusseh took a deep breath . Then another . Raztupisp-minz did likewise . Pheromones filled his lungs . A sweet flavor . " Grandson , you are my only relative , " Takpusseh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with you . " Raztupisp-minz backed away slowly , then settled to a crouch . He waited until Takpusseh was similarly postured . " Speak . " " I wish you to carry winter flowers with me . " " Ah . I have seen you grow stronger with new domains . I am glad , Takpusseh  --  buthave you not waited overlong ? The Time is upon the Sleeper Herd , and you are hardly able to be rational . " " I know of no unmated Sleeper who would have me to mate . I speak of Tashayamp . " " Ah . Of acceptable lineage , and competent in her work . Yes . " He let his voice trail to nothing , without a stop . " But , " Takpusseh said . " Yes . She is not comely . Indeed , some would say she is misshapen . Yet I find her attractive enough , and as you say , she is diligent at her work . " " It happens seldom that spaceborn mates to sleeper . Do you know that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one to speak for me . None save you  --  " " Yamp , " Raztupisp-minz mused . " Her grandfather is Persantip-yamp . He is said to be irascible . A warrior in his day . " And say no more ; there was no war , but had there been , it could only have been against the sleepers . " You wish me to speak with him . " " I ask that , my leader . " " Tashayamp . " Raztupisp-minz snorted wry mirth . " I have little experience in this , I should ask you what to say ! Our roles are indeed reversed , in all ways . Let me sec if I recall the words I am to say  --  " " I know them , " Takpusseh admitted . " But let the customs be kept . " He listened as Raztupisp-minz stumbled through the traditional lecture : that the fithp mate for life , that mating is an alliance forever , not to be entered through passions . " Are you certain it is not passion ? It is Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Takpusseh said . " Recall , I am  --  somewhat  --  older than you . I was mated to your grandmother . I know something of passion , and of reason as well . " " Yes . Politically , it is a good match . The yamp clan holds a wide domain ; and you have taken your own . " And you are male , mating with a spaceborn female . It is not as if it were the other way , spaceborn male to submit  --  " I will speak with Persantip-yamp , and if he will consent , I will come with you to present the winter flowers . " Raztupisp-minz rose to his feet . " And my congratulations ! "  |p272The  opinion of the strongest is always the best. - JEAN DE LA FONTAINECOUNTDOWN : H PLUS FIVE WEEKSThey had floated forward , then inward along half a mile of spiral corridor , not quite in free-fall , but with so little gravity that motion was difficult for the newcomers . Wes tried to help where he could . Two alien warriors carried large boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them : a cargo door , much bigger than would be needed to pass a fi ' . They entered . This huge chamber must be along the axis of the ship , forward of the chamber of the Podo Thuktun . A line of yellow-white light ran down the middle , too bright to look at directly . Elsewhere there was green , everywheregreen , with splashes of carmine and yellow . Alien plants grew in cages , rooted in thick wet pads fixed along the walls . Green banners flapped in the breeze from the air conditioning . A field of yellow flowers turned as if to look at the intruders . Here was a roughly rectangular block of loose dirt . Vines wrapped it loosely , and it was riddled with seven-inch holes . A head popped from a hole and was gone before Wes could react . A streamlined head , it had been , like a ferret 's , with red beads for eyes . It was , finally , like being on another world . Wes stole a glance at the others . Jeri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he killed at any moment . The prospect did n't seem to frighten her much . Before she allowed herself to he escorted from thep273cell , she had led the others in prayer , and stared disapprovingly at Wes Dawson when he did n't join in . Melissa and Gary were gaping : not frightened , but delighted . Plants , birds , animals  --  and distant objects , after confinement in cells and corridors . Melissa pointed at something above them . It was gone before Wes could see it , but they all stopped to look . Takpussch looked back impatiently . " Conic ! " They followed hastily . Otherwise the warrior fithp would use their gun butts as prods , not brutally but playfully , as if they were herding children . A tree grew along the ship 's axis , thirty feet tall . One continuous green leaf ran round it in a spiral . Guy wires along its trunk braced it against lateral acceleration . Something dived at Wes 's head . He ducked as the warrior behind him casually brushed the thing aside with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bird . They were everywhere : long-necked birds with large , colorful aft wings that turned up sharply at the tips , and small canards set to either side of the long neck . Wes gaped in wonder . " Is this your food source ? " he asked . " Ours and yours . " Takpusseh waved his trunk at a plot of bare dirt . It must have been recently cleared : dust and plant detritus floated in the air around it . The teacher said , " Now you have plants from your own world to grow here . Space has been set aside . " John Woodward came forward to the boxes of soil . Gingerly he took a handful and rubbed it in his fingers . " Good Kansas soil , " he said . " Maybe we 'll live long enough for something to grow . " " You will live , " Takpusseh said . He peered at the farmer . " Do you suffer for your distance from your home ? One day you will land with us . " Woodward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you will grow your own food , " Tashayamp said . " On the level trays , and in those . " She pointed to cages filled with earth . " Climbing is one thing you may do better than fithp . There is a flower . This . " She held out a flower , bright , shaped like a long , thin trumpet . It was as large as a sunflower , with wild colors . Strange shapes lurked deep within the blossom . She 's learned English fast , Wes thought . But her posture is  --  strange . Why ? I wish I could read their body language . " We have seeds , " she said . " You will grow this in soil from your world . " " What if it wo n't grow ? " John Woodward demanded . " It will grow . If need , we will mix soil from other world . It will grow . " " And that 's important ? " Wes asked . " It may be , " she said . She glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will also grow to feed you . " Takpusseh took a seed packet from one of the boxes . It was tiny in his ropy digits . I he peered at it . tore it open . Some of the seeds spilled . A warrior was prepared : he swept a fine-mesh net through the cloud . Takpusseh himself ignored the incident . " Farmingp274is different when you float . Seed must be pushed in , so , with small tool ... no , your digits are small enough . Water comes from below , from wall . Against forward wall , find special tools . Sticks to hold plants against thrust . Tools to stir dirt . " John and Carrie Woodward were examining the dirt plot . They began taking seeds out of the boxes . John said , " Plants should grow taller here , " with a question in his voice . The children moved warily away , their eyes wide with wonder . Somethinglike a bird whizzed past . " Not there , " Tashayamp called . She motioned the children back to the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Aft , from the grove of spiral-wound trees , came the wind-instrument murmur of fithp voices . The Herdmaster had climbed a huge pillar plant . Like the humans themselves , in the minuscule gravity he had become a brachiator . He found the viewpoint odd , amusing . He watched . In a forward corner of the Garden the human prisoners worked . The Herdmaster admired their agility , newly trained dirtyfeet that they were . They seemed docile enough as they planted alien seeds in alien soil . Yet the Breakers ' disturbing reports could not be ignored much longer . It was more than enough to make his head ache . Yet here were smells to ease his mind : plants in bloom , and a melancholy whiff of funereal scent . The end of life for the Traveler Fithp was the funeral pit , and then the Garden . Twelve fithp warriors , wounded on Winterhome , had gone to the funeral pit after Digit Ship Six returned them to Message Bearer . The Garden was in perpetual bloom . Seasons mixed here , created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alien growths might require alterations in weather . He hoped otherwise . Winterhome would be hospitable to Garden life , if the humans actually persuaded anything to grow here . The Herdmaster would have preferred to loll in warm mud , but Message Bearer 's mudrooms had been drained while her drive guided the Foot toward its fiery fate . He had sought rest in the Garden ; and it was here that the Year Zero Fithp confronted him . In the riot of scents he had not smelled their presence . Suddenly faces were looking at him over the edges of leafspiral , below him on the trunk of the pillar plant . He looked back silently , letting them know that they had disturbed his time of quiet . Born within a few eight-days of each other in an orgy of reproduction that had not been matched before or since , the Year Zero Fithp all looked much alike : smooth of skin , long-limbed and lean . Why not ? But age clus/tors did n't always think so much alike . These were the inner herd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked older than the rest . His skin was darkened and roughened , one leg was immobilized with braces , and there was a look . This one had seen horrors . With the Advisor 's consent , the Herdmaster had chosen to divide the Year Zero Fithp . Half the males had gone down to Winterhome . They were dead , or alive and circling Winterhome after the natives ' counterattack . That injured one must be fresh from the wars . The Herdmaster 's claws gripped the trunk as he faced nine fithp below him . For a moment he thought to summon warriors ; then a sense of amusementcame over him . Dissidents they might be , but these were not rebels . So . They sought to awe the Herdmaster , did they ? And they had brought a hero fresh from the wars . No , these were no rogues . They wanted only to increase their influence .. . " You have found me , " he said mildly . " Speak . " Still they were silent . Two of the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tashayamp . Now the humans worked more slowly . They watched , no doubt , though they must be out of earshot . What passed here might affect all the herds of Winterhome . Still it was an imposition , and the Herdmaster would have asked Tashayamp to remove them if he could have spared the attention . Finally one spoke . " Advisor Fathisteh-tulk had said that he would gather with us . He said that he had something to tell us . He did not come . We are told that he has not been seen on the bridge in two days . " " He has neglected his duties , " Pastempeh-keph said mildly . " He has avoided the bridge , and his mate , nor does he answer calls . I have alerted my senior officers , but no others . Is it your will that I should ask for his arrest ? " They looked at each other , undecided . One said firmly , " No , Herdmaster . " He was a massive young fi ' , posed a bit ahead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you do not know where he is either ? " " We had hoped to find him through you , Herdmaster . " " Ha . I have asked his mate . She has not seen him , yet she has a newborn to show . " The Herdmaster became serious . " There are matters to decide , and we have no Advisor . What must I do ? " They looked at each other again . " The teqthuktun  --  " " Precisely . " Pastempch-keph breathed more easily . They still worried about the Law and their religion . Not rogues , not yet . " I can take no counsel nor make any decisions without advice from the sleepers . It is the tegthuktun , the pact we made with them , and Fistarteh-thuktun insists upon it . Now I have no Advisor , and there are platters to decide . Speak . What must I do ? " You must find another Advisor , " the wounded one said.  | " Indeed . " This hardly required discussion . The Traveler fithp might continue on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an Advisor . Fathisteh-tulk might be dead , or too badly injured to perform his duties . He might have shirked his duty , crippling the herd at a critical moment . He might have been kidnapped ... and if some herd within the Traveler Herd had been pushed to such an act , it would be stripped of its status . But the Advisor would still lose his post , for arousing such anger , for being so careless , for being gone . The Herdmaster had already decided on his successor . Still , he must be found . " You , the injured one  --  " " Herdmaster , I am Eight-Squared Leader Chintithpit-mang . " He had heard that name ; but where ? Later . " You must come fresh from the digit ship . Do you know anything of this ? Or are you only here to add numbers ? " " I know nothing of the Advisor . What I do know  --  " " Later . You , Rashinggith . If you knew where the Advisor might be , you would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assuredly would , Herdmaster . " " But you might not tell me . Is there a place known only to dissidents ? A place where he might commune with other dissidents , or only with himself ? " " No . Herdmaster , we fear for him . " There must be such a place , but the dissidents themselves would have searched it by now . " I too fear for Fathisteh-tulk , " the Herdmaster admitted . " I went so far as to examine records of use of the airlocks , following which I summoned a list of fithp in charge of guarding the airlocks  --  " " I chance to know that no dissidents guard the airlocks , " Rashinggith said . An interesting admission . " I was looking for more than dissidents . Did it strike any of you that what Fathisteh-tulk was doing was dangerous ? Considerthe position of the sleepers . In herd rank the Advisor is the only sleeper of any real authority . The sleepers could not ask his removal . Yet he consistentlyopposed the War for Winterhome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one : Fathisteh-tulk . " They looked at each other , and the Herdmaster knew at once that other sleepers held dissident views . Later . " There are sleepers in charge of guardingthe airlocks . The drive is more powerful than the pull of the Foot 's mass . A corpse would drop behind , but would not disintegrate . The drive flame is hot but not dense . Our telescopes have searched for traces of a corpse in our wake . " Pause . " There is none . " Shall we consider murder , then ? By dissidents seeking a martyr , or conservative sleepers avoiding future embarrassment ? Or did Fathisteh-tulk learn something that some fi ' wanted hidden ? Or is he alive , hiding somewherefor his own purposes ? Rashinggith , what did Fathisteh-tulk plan top277tell you ? " The Herdmaster looked about him . " Do any of you know ? Did he leave hints ? Did he even have interesting questions when last you saw him ? " " We do n't know he 's dead , " Rashinggith said uneasily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him . I hope to ask him where he has been . " That was a half-truth . Fathisteh-tulk would cause minimal embarrassment by being dead . On to other matters . The Herdmasterhad remembered a name . " Chintithpit-mang , you had someting to say ? " Nervous but dogged , the injured warrior got his mouth working . " The prey , the humans , they do n't know how to surrender . " " They can be taught . " " There was a  --  a burly one , bigger than most . I whipped his toy weapon from his hand and knocked him down and put my foot on his chest and he clawed at me with his bony digits until I pushed harder . I think I crushed him . Of the prisoners we brought back , only the scarlet-headed exotic would help us select human food ! Even after we take their surrender they do not cooperate . Must we teach them to surrender , four billion of them , one at a time ? We must abandon the target world . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one vast funeral pit ! " Chintithpit-mang was one of six officers under Siplisteph . Siplisteph was a sleeper ; his mate had not survived frozen sleep , and he had not mated since . He had reached Winterhome as eight-cubed leader of the intelligence group . It was an important post , and Siplisteph had risen higher still due to deaths among his superiors . The Herdmaster intended to ask him to become his Advisor , subject to the approval of the females of the sleeper herd  --  and Fistarteh-thuktun , as keeper of the teqthuktun . Chintithpit-mang was among those who might have Siplisteph 's post . " Why did you seek me ? " the Herdmaster demanded . The response was unexpected : first one , then others , began a keening wail . The rest joined . It was the sound made by lost children . Frightening . Why do I feel the urge to join my voice to theirs ? " We no longer know who we are , Herdmaster , " Chintithpit-mang blurted . " Why are we here ? " " We bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thuktunthp . They have their own way , " Chintithpit-mang insisted . " If they do not know the thuktunthp , how can they know they do not seek them ? " Could this one be worthy of promotion ? Are any ? Shall I ask hint to remain ? No . Now is not the time to judge him , fresh from battle and still twitching , injured , and plunged suddenly into the scents of bloomingWinter Flower and sleeper females in heat . " Chintithpit-mang , you need time and rest to recover from your experience . Go now . All of you , go . " For one moment they stood . Then they filed away.
