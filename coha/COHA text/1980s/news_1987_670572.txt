Robert Eisner , a professor of economics at Northwestern University and the president-elect of the American Economic Association , has attacked budget cutting now as " conventional wisdom " that threatens " economic disaster . " It would be a " mindless throwback to the economics of Herbert Hoover , " he says . <> <> New Depression Feared // Paul Davidson , professor of political economy at the University of Tennessee and editor of the Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics , declares that , after the market plunge , raising revenues and lowering Government spending to reduce the deficit " can exacerbate current recessionary tendencies and can even create a second Great Depression in the 20th century. " // And some of President Reagan ' s most committed supporters of " supply-side " economics , such as Paul Craig Roberts of Georgetown University ; Jude Wanniski , president of Polyconomics Inc. , and Robert L. Bartley , the editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal , bitterly oppose any budget-shrinking moves that involve tax rises. // Such steps , they say , would have the perverse effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation would chill the economy , reduce personal and business incomes , and thus lower tax receipts. // President Reagan , while sending his men to negotiate with Congress , has continued to assert he will resist a tax increase , though he is willing to accept measures that could be called " revenue enhancement. " // The Wall Street Journal ' s editorial page , suspicious of a deal , warned that " the sight of the President selling out what everyone knows to be his beliefs will be anything but reassuring to the markets . " Suggesting that a lack of leadership was responsible for the crash - it had already blamed Black Monday on expectations that taxes would be raised - The Journal quoted a Wall Street quip , " None of this would have happened if Reagan were still President. " // So goes the provocative argument now being made by strange bedfellows : the liberal hard-core Keynesians and conservative supply-siders . As arresting as it is , does their warning make sense ? Or , to the contrary , is the need to cut the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crash , or even more so ? // Obviously , not all Keynesians share Professor Eisner ' s and Professor Davidson ' s fear of throwing the economy into recession . Lawrence Summers , professor of economics at Harvard , calls Mr. Eisner and Mr. Davidson " hard-core Keynesians , " in contrast to " eclectic Keynesians " like Prof. Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who last week was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science , and Prof. Paul A. Samuelson , also of M.I.T. , the first American economist to receive the Nobel prize , and Professor Summers himself . <> <> A Strange Alliance // The eclectic Keynesians are themselves in a strange alliance , intellectually in league with conservative counterparts such as Martin Feldstein of Harvard and David Rockefeller and a great many other business and financial executives , all of whom urge action to shrink the budget deficit . They warn that , if the President and Congress fail to act , it would likely rattle the markets and touch off another plunge. // It is true , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1929 crash did exacerbate the weaknesses of the economy and help thrust it into the Depression . The Hoover Administration reasoned that , to balance the budget , the Government would have to raise tax rates . And the Federal Revenue Act of 1932 nearly doubled tax rates . The top rate of the personal income tax soared to 63 percent from 24 percent , and other rates were raised , less sharply , all along the line. // Unquestionably the effort added burdens to the economy , restricted private spending even more and made worse the deflation of prices that was already under way. // But the big tax increase was not the only cause of the Depression . Fear of inflation , in this period of falling prices and employment , also stopped the Federal Reserve from making more money and credit available and from stronger action to bring down interest rates . The situation was made worse by the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and the spread of " beggar-thy-neighbor " actions to other countries : not only tariff walls but " Buy American " or " Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> One of Four Unemployed // By 1933 , when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office , one out of four Americans was unemployed . The world trading and financial system had broken down. // Today , would measures to shrink the budget deficit mean repeating that grim scenario ? // The answer is that it certainly need not . What is crucial is that steps to reduce the budget deficit be offset by actions of the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy and thereby bring down interest rates . That would avoid compounding the downward pressure on the economy of tighter fiscal policy . Lower interest rates would ease consumer borrowing and spending , inspire business investment and help to strengthen the stock and bond markets . They would also ease the debt burdens of Latin American , African and other third world countries. // But why act to reduce the budget deficit at all at this point ? // First , because that would ease the problem of the Federal Reserve in bringing down interest rates , at a time when the dollar is under heavy pressure and the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and payments . <> <> Aid of Others Needed // If United States interest rates are to be brought down , without sending the dollar into a free fall , it will require the cooperation of the other major industrial countries in coordinating interest rates and exchange rates . ( If , for instance , the Germans raise their interest rates , it may force the United States to follow suit , lest the dollar fall out of control . ) A rapid fall in the dollar could unleash inflation , drive foreign capital out and drive United States interest rates higher , cutting off investment and housing construction and thrusting the economy into recession. // Yet , if the dollar is to be held where it is , this makes the task of curing the nation ' s trade deficit that much more difficult . Hence , faster growth in Europe and Japan is important because the American economy will be growing somewhat more slowly as a result of a tighter fiscal policy. // Overall growth of the world economy and world trade is crucial to preventing a worsening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby repeating one of the key causes of the Depression in the 1930 ' s . It has become vital to think of the international economy as a closely integrated entity and to link together national economic policies for the world as a whole. // For the United States , the right mixture of fiscal and monetary policy now - with a plan for narrowing the budget deficit and Federal Reserve action to supply more liquidity to business and the banking system - should make possible a dramatic decline in interest rates , and this would greatly strengthen market confidence and public opinion . The idea would be to stabilize the economy at a much lower structure of interest rates. // Some economists , such as George Perry of the Brookings Institution , believe that a $23 billion cut in the 1988 deficit , and nothing more - which is all that the White House and Congress are now considering - would be " a big disappointment " to the financial markets . Bond prices would fall and rates would soar , all over again . Mr. Perry , who sees wide scope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be $40 billion this year and $60 billion next year , if not more . In his view , the economy , which is still expanding , could absorb that kind of fiscal action and benefit. // A number of leading economists emphasize that , to have the best effect on the markets , the current budget shrinking must be seen as part of a solid , long-run plan. //
