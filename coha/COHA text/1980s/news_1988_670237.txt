ARMONK , N.Y.  --  International Business Machines Corp. , seeking to raise the return on its massive research and development investments , said it will start charging more money to license its 32 , 000 patents around the world . In announcing the change , IBM also said that it ' s willing to license patents for its PS/2 line of personal computers . The statement made it clearer than ever that IBM expects to see legal clones of the PS/ 2 . But the new license-rate increases could narrow the field of clone-makers . Separately , the world ' s largest computer company created new operations to emphasize two important IBM strategies : simplifying its hodgepodge of different software designs , and getting into the lucrative service business of setting up new computer systems . IBM ' s new patent policy is one of many signals that U.S. companies are taking patents more seriously . Congress has strengthened patent law over the last decade and courts increasingly have been affirming steep damages against patent-infringers . Polaroid Corp. recently asked Eastman Kodak Co. for as much as $5. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its new patent policy calls for charges of as much as 5% of sales revenue for products that use more than one IBM patent . Previously , IBM wouldn ' t charge more than a 1% royalty for any patent license . IBM said it will still charge a maximum of 1% for products that only use a single IBM patent . IBM ' s over 9 , 000 U.S. patents and over 23 , 000 international ones cover a vast range of high-technology developments , ranging from technical arcana to such commonplace products as the floppy disk . The patents already give IBM powerful leverage to use other companies ' technology , since it often grants licenses in exchange for other patents . The new higher rates also could help IBM in price wars against rivals who use its patents . IBM ' s statement that its PS/2 patents are available for license didn ' t come as a surprise . IBM executives have frequently said they expect to see legal PS/2 clones . They have even hinted that they might welcome clones on the market , since they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief exclusive feature , a data pathway called the Micro Channel . William Lowe , the head of IBM ' s personal-computer business , joked in an interview last month that one rival ' s efforts to sell clone-makers chips that mimic the Micro Channel might yield good marketing material for IBM . " They have a very persuasive presentation on the advantages of the Micro Channel , " he said . But IBM also has indicated it would just as soon see only a handful of clones , not the onslaught that went after the first PC , which was built largely with off-the-shelf parts . IBM designed the PS/2 with lots of its own protected technology , seeking to make it less vulnerable to the clone-makers . Besides patents , the protected technology includes trade secrets and copyrighted material that IBM won ' t license to anyone . The new royalty increases could help thin the clone-makers ' ranks . " By raising the fee they somewhat limit how many people can be involved , " said Tim Bajarin , a personal-computer industry consultant . " You aren ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between IBM and the dirtball clones on the market now . " IBM ' s corporate realignment added a seventh group to the six that chairman John Akers created in January in a sweeping overhaul intended to decentralize decision-making . The new group , Programming Systems , will oversee one of IBM ' s biggest in-house projects : developing a single software format for all its machines from PCs to mainframes . Its chief will be IBM vice president Earl Wheeler . One of IBM customers ' most common complaints has been that it ' s too hard to link IBM ' s different families of machines . One of the biggest reasons Digital Equipment Corp. has been able to lure so many IBM customers is that its gear , by contrast , is all easy to connect . The other new IBM operation , for the business of setting up new computer systems , will be run by Gerald Ebker . IBM gave one of its top sales executives , Ned C. Lautenbach , a new job supervising Mr. Ebker ' s division , a software division and a grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " IBM tapped David M. Thomas to succeed Mr. Lautenbach as head of the National Distribution Division , which oversees IBM ' s relations with retailers .
