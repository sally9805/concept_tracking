The steep decline in world oil prices is good news for U.S. consumers , who can celebrate by turning up their thermostat a touch or taking a trip in their Winnebago . Falling energy costs are also invigorating the stock market , where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.06 points last week to close at a record 1570.99 . But for the once flush U.S. petroleum industry , no gushers of champagne have flowed since 1981 , when the value of oil peaked . And last month 's 25% drop in crude prices is bringing even more failures and layoffs to the Energy Belt . Last week one of the largest offshore drilling companies , Houston 's Global Marine ( 1985 revenues : $379 million ) , filed a bankruptcy petition . The company , which operates 34 rigs , will stay in business but wants temporary protection from its creditors , to which it owes some $1.1 billion . <P> More collapses in the drilling business seem likely to follow , since oil prices have fallen so low that they provide little incentive for exploration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with a peak of 4,530 in 1981 . Global was particularly vulnerable because it borrowed heavily to buy modern equipment . Said Jerry Martin , Global 's senior vice president : " The downturn did n't surprise us , but we did n't think it would last this long . " <P> Big Oil , meanwhile , has gone on a stringent diet . Atlantic Richfield , which had already slashed its work force from 39,000 to 29,000 , announced last week that it will lay off as many as 2,000 more and close its exploration office in Denver . <P> As the oil barons fretted about falling prices last week , they suffered new pain from an old wound . The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of a lower- court decision requiring Exxon , the largest U.S. oil company , to make a $2.1 billion refund for overcharges to customers . Since it would be impossible to track down all the wronged customers , the money will be given to state governments for such projects as insulating public buildings and helping the poor with utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by charging Exxon with violating crude-oil price controls that were in force between 1973 and 1981 . In asking the Supreme Court to turn down the case , the department claimed that because the law has expired , the issue did not have enough continuing importance to be taken up by the highest court . The Justices apparently agreed . Exxon Chairman Clifton C. Garvin Jr. , who contended that the price- control law was an inequitable hodgepodge , pronounced the company " extremely disappointed " with the ruling . Even so , Wall Street investors think the payment will be only a minor blow for Exxon , which had revenues of $93.2 billion last year . <P> The decision , though , could be expensive for other oil companies . As many as 400 overcharging cases involving up to $4 billion still await resolution . One accused firm , Atlantic Richfield , agreed last week to pay the Government $315 million to satisfy such claims .
