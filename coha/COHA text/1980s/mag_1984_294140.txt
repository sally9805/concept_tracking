Gemayel 's visit to Damascus signals a Syrian fait accompli <P> Red carpets were rolled out lavishly in Damascus last week in a ceremony that marked both a welcome for the guest and a triumph for the host . On the tarmac of the city 's international airport , Syrian President Hafez Assad waited patiently as a chartered executive jet glided to a halt and delivered his reluctant visitor , Lebanese President Amin Gemayel . The two men embraced , then repaired to a dais while ranks of Syrian troops passed in review and field guns barked out a 21-gun salute . The solicitous display spoke volumes about the intricacies of politics in the Middle East . Having achieved almost everything he desired in Lebanon , Assad was now making an exquisite show of courtesy and support for the Christian Maronite leader whose U.S.-backed government the Syrian President had demolished . <P> Assad could well afford the gesture . After months of chaos and bloodshed , Syria was in a position to exercise de facto suzerainty over much of Lebanon . In contrast , the Reagan Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flotilla off the shores of Beirut , was reduced to the role of passive spectator . <P> During Gemayel 's two-day visit to Damascus-remarkably , his first since taking power 17 months ago-he and Assad worked out the conditions of the new Syrian hegemony . Chief among their topics was how best to abrogate the May 17 security agreement between Israel and Lebanon , a condition to which Gemayel had agreed in principle before leaving for Damascus . In return Assad was prepared to support Gemayel 's continuation in office , albeit within a restructured Lebanese political system that would give more power to the Druze and Shi'ite Muslim opposition groups that have been wreaking havoc in the streets of Beirut . <P> After four meetings totaling more than seven hours , a Syrian spokesman described the sessions between Assad and Gemayel as " positive and fruitful . " Tangible results , he said , would occur " within the next few days . " The first fruit of the talks , however , was supposed to be a general cease-fire in Lebanon .

By Saturday , however , Jumblatt and Berri had dropped their demand for Gemayel 's resignation . <P> The next result of the Assad-Gemayel talks will be the attempted resuscitation of the moribund Geneva negotiations among all Lebanese factions over the formation of a government of national unity . A spokesman for Gemayel predicted that the conference would begin by the end of this week , " if not sooner . " Opposition Leaders Jumblatt and Berri would most likely be invited to join the new government , which Syria has promised to help by extending its rule to parts of Lebanon currently outside Gemayel 's control . <P> Once-and if-a unity government is formed , the Syrians have promised to hold detailed discussions with it over the withdrawal of 62,000 Syrian troops from Lebanese territory . Assad remains insistent , however , that full Syrian withdrawal will not take place until Israel removes its 22,000 troops from southern Lebanon .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
