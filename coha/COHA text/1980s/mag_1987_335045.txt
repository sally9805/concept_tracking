What do Frank Sinatra , Diana Ross , Neil Diamond , Miami Vice , Little Shop of Horrors and Nair hair-removal cream have in common ? They have all generated earnings for an obscure Los Angeles company , the Four Seasons Partnership . Like many businesses in the entertainment field , the firm employs technicians , musicians and other professionals , but the heart of the company is a 25-year- old creative and financial partnership between two men  --  Bob Gaudio and Frankie Valli  --  that is highly unusual , if not unique , in the world of business . Gaudio , 46 , is a composer , pianist , arranger and producer who has worked on records with Sinatra , Ross , Diamond , Michael Jackson and Barry Manilow . Valli , 53 , is the veteran pop singer whose high-pitched voice ( a critic once likened it to an air-raid siren ) still packs in audiences at basketball arenas , concert halls , nightclubs and casinos . Both men were original members of the Four Seasons , the famed rock group that next month will launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasons hits , including such Gaudio tunes as Big Girls Do n't Cry and Who Loves You , have sold more than 100 million records and tapes . <P> Though Gaudio stopped performing with the group more than 15 years ago and his career took off on a different course from Valli 's , their fortunes have remained intertwined . Reason : they are still partners despite their professional separation , and they split all income  --  whoever earns it  --  down the middle . When Gaudio co-produced the music for Manilow 's TV special Copacabana , he gave half of his earnings to Valli , who had nothing to do with the show . When Valli headlined a big concert last year at New Jersey 's Meadowlands Arena , Gaudio got half the profits even though he was in London producing the sound track for the movie Little Shop of Horrors . Naturally , Valli got half the profits for Gaudio 's film work . <P> The arrangement dates back to 1962 , when Gaudio and Valli , who came from working-class Italian neighborhoods in the Bronx and Newark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time , Valli was a barber , Gaudio worked in a printing plant , and the Four Seasons was an unknown group playing on weekends in small clubs and bowling alleys . Sitting one evening in Valli 's apartment in a Newark low-income housing project , the two friends decided to be partners forever and share their earnings equally . Recalls Gaudio : " We said , ' Neither one of us knows where we 're going to wind up , but maybe we should hedge our bets . You get 50% of me , and I get 50% of you . " They shook hands on the deal . <P> In September 1962 the partnership struck gold when Gaudio 's song Sherry and Valli 's shrill vocals put the Four Seasons on top of the pop world . In 1971 Gaudio , who never liked performing , stopped touring with the Four Seasons but continued to produce the group 's records and started working with other artists as well . Valli agreed to stay with the Seasons as lead singer . All the while , Gaudio and Valli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have divided well over $50 million on the strength of their original handshake . Says Valli : " If you trust your partner , contracts are not important . We have never had to police one another . " Indeed , they see each other only occasionally . Gaudio is based in Los Angeles , while Valli 's home is in Fort Lee , N.J.
