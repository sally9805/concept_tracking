A pair of prosecutions may not be double jeopardy <P> Last August the body of Rebecca Heath was found near La Grange , Ga. , slumped behind the steering wheel of her family 's Oldsmobile . The car had smashed into a small tree , and at first it appeared that she , and the nine-month fetus she was carrying , had died in an auto accident . X rays revealed , however , that her right eyelid had been closed over a bullet hole made by a .32-cal. slug as it was fired into her brain . Investigators in La Grange then built a case of murder-for-hire against her husband Larry , his girlfriend Denise Lambert and three local hoods enlisted with the alleged help of Heath 's brother Jerry . Though Jerry has yet to be tried , the others got sentences ranging from life for Larry to ten years for Denise . <P> Normally , that is all there would have been to it , and the nasty , sordid little murder would have taken its place in local lore . But now the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbooks , plus a place on death row . The reason is an apparently unique question of double jeopardy . It arises from the fact that while Becky Heath 's body was found in La Grange , Ga. , her murderers picked her up , or perhaps kidnaped her , from her home 45 miles away in Phenix City , Ala . And after some of the defendants had confessed or pleaded guilty in La Grange , the prosecutor across the border in Phenix City announced that he also planned to try them , on conspiracy and kidnap-murder charges , and would make use of their Georgia confessions and guilty pleas . After a hearing last week , a Georgia judge reserved decision on whether to allow them to be taken to Alabama for trial , while he attempted to sort out all the complexities . <P> The defendants , of course , are claiming that a second trial would violate the Fifth Amendment 's double-jeopardy clause . The rule , as the Supreme Court reiterated it in 1975 , is : " When a defendant has been once convicted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finality require that he not be subjected to the possibility of further punishment by being again tried or sentenced for the same offense . " Scholars , nonetheless , tend to doubt that this precludes separate state prosecutions . Says University of Virginia Law Professor Stephen Saltzburg : " Two different states , or a state and the Federal Government , can prosecute what one state can not prosecute twice . " Agrees Harvard Law Professor Arthur Miller : " If Alabama wants to try to convict these people , then that is its right . " There is more debate , however , about whether the Georgia confessions and guilty pleas can be used in Alabama constitutionally .
