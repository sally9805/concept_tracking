Nativity scenes bring a harsh cacophony of jingle bells and legal jangles <P> The Christmas lights on the sturdy , 30-ft . Colorado blue spruce blinked on at precisely 5:52 last Thursday evening , revealing a dazzling pattern of poinsettias that sparkled cheerfully against the capital 's skyline . A large screen showed Ronald and Nancy Reagan presiding over the annual lighting ceremony of the national Christmas tree from the South Portico of the White House , 500 yards away . The President did what the heads of many U.S. families do at Christmas observances : reflect on the meaning of the celebration , offer hope for the less fortunate and remember those who must spend this most personal of holidays away from home . " For many of us , Christmas is a deeply holy day , " Reagan told 20,000 people gathered in springlike 58 weather . " For others , Christmas marks the birth of a good , great man ... Either way , the message remains the guiding star of our endeavors . " <P> Washington 's official celebration , echoed in festivals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Christmas Pageant of Peace . Held on the Ellipse , a 52-acre circular park between the White House and the Washington Monument , it included not only the elaborately decorated national Christmas tree but also 56 smaller ones representing the states , U.S. territories and the District of Columbia . In addition , the National Zoo installed nine live reindeer near by , and each day a traditional yule log is set ablaze . That feature proved less than popular during last Thursday 's balmy weather . " That 's what happens when you have a weatherman for Santa Claus , " cracked red-suited TV Forecaster Willard Scott , the master of ceremonies . <P> The final element in this year 's pageant was a crche , an assemblage of near life-size figures around a manger scene representing Christ 's birth . The display included painted representations of Joseph and Mary , the gift-bearing Magi , two angels and assorted animals-20 pieces in all . It would have been wholly unremarkable , similar to thousands of others , except for one thing : this particular Nativity scene was reappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eleven years , the hostage in a legal dispute involving the constitutional separation of church and state . <P> Thanks to a Supreme Court decision earlier in the year , Nativity scenes this season also adorn the public parks and buildings of some municipalities that had ceased putting them up while the issue was in dispute . But the Supreme Court 's ruling , permitting the city of Pawtucket , R.I. , to erect a creche , failed to settle the matter . Crche critics , insisting that many of the displays still represent unlawful government sponsorship of church activity , are seeking to severely limit the court 's ruling . As a result , the jingle bells of the season once again were interrupted by the jangle of legal discord . Items :
