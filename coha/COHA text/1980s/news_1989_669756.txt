A London street brawl in the making ? // Not quite . The lean frame belongs to Dustin Hoffman , and the vehement words are Shakespeare ' s. // Inside a nearby building , a rehearsal for British director Peter Hall ' s production of ' ' The Merchant of Venice ' ' was in progress . The production played a sold-out run in London last summer , and now , having crossed the Atlantic , is set to open on Broadway next Tuesday. // // Inside the hall at the rehearsal I visited last spring , Sir Peter was running through a scene with other cast members , while Hoffman and the other actor were going over their lines outdoors . Soon it was lunch time , and Hall , arguably Britain ' s most influential postwar theater director ( he headed the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre ) , took a break over scrambled eggs and smoked salmon to tell me how he and Hoffman managed to team up for one of the most talked-about shows of the year. // ' ' I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' He called me up . . . and said , ' I want to do some Shakespeare ; do you think I can ? ' I said , ' It depends what it is , and how you want to begin . ' He suggested one or two things that I didn ' t think were appropriate , particularly to start with . Then I mentioned Shylock to him , because it ' s a great part , and I think in this day and age it has to be played by a Jew , since the play is about racism . Just as I think Othello has to be played by a black man. ' ' // Hall expands on this point : Today ' s society is acutely race conscious , he notes . ' ' Blessedly so , ' ' he adds ; but this has led to certain taboos . ' ' And one of those taboos , ' ' he says , ' ' is one race imitating another . As a consequence , today , for example , I think Jewishness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to be . I don ' t insist on it . But I think it ' s more in tune with the particular times we live in. // But isn ' t casting a Jew as Shylock also a way of making more acceptable a play that may , to some , appear to feed into centuries old anti-Semitic sentiments ? // ' ' I don ' t think it ' s an anti-Semitic play , ' ' says Sir Peter . ' ' I think it ' s a play about intolerance , in which the Christians come out rather worse than the Jews . . . . One of the things the play is saying is : Whatever the faults of the Jews as a minority , they have been produced by what the Christians have done to them ; the ' Hath not a Jew eyes , ' that great speech , is conveying precisely that. // ' ' I think what ' s brilliant about it is that Shakespeare wrote the play for an audience that would have been anti-Semitic . Yet he turned it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are doing ? ' . . . The central point for me is that Shylock wants to be like the Christians , to some extent . He wants to belong ; he wants to join the country club , and they won ' t let him . . . . If the ( production ) works , your heart breaks for Shylock. ' ' // Intolerance , Hall contends , is the overriding theme of every scene in the play , not only between gentile and Jew , but men and women , old and young , rich and poor , white and black . Each character , through the extremities of their circumstance , tries to achieve some form of maturity ; yet , tantalizingly , the final act does not bring a complete resolution. // ' ' ' The Merchant of Venice ' doesn ' t have an easy , happy ending , ' ' the director says , ' ' but has always been so popular that there are . . . a lot of cliches surrounding it . The play is a bit like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they don ' t really look at it. ' ' // Hall ' s Broadway production of ' ' Merchant ' ' will include Hoffman and 11 others from the British cast ; pushing for wholesale transatlantic stage transfers - a difficult business , given the protective nature of both British and American unions - is something Hall feels strongly about . ' ' We ' ve got two cultures that share so many riches , ' ' he says . ' ' I wish we could share our actors more . I think English plays in America done by the English and American plays done here by Americans would have such a wonderful revitalizing effect on our theater and our societies. ' ' // ' MERCHANT ' ' marks the second production of Sir Peter ' s new organization , the Peter Hall Company ; the first was ' ' Orpheus Descending , ' ' with the Vanessa Redgrave in the lead. // This is a new direction for Hall after 25 years of running huge , state-subsidized , British stage organizations . He spent 10 years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , and 15 as artistic chief ( following its founder , Laurence Olivier ) of the National Theatre . He says going to a smaller company and going commercial are things he has long dreamed of . He plans to mount productions he has wanted to do for years but couldn ' t , given the size of the companies he was running. // The game plan is to open his shows in London , then take them to New York . If he can , as a byproduct , revive even one of the many theaters now closed on Broadway , Hall says he will be happy . ' ' Broadway is dead , ' ' he comments . ' ' I don ' t know what it ' s about now ; it ' s about plastic shows for tourists . You ' re lucky these days if you can find a play there. ' ' // Hall , who directed the original stage productions of Samuel Beckett ' s ' ' Waiting for Godot ' ' ( in English ) , Harold Pinter ' s ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Amadeus , ' ' is perhaps most highly regarded for his pioneering work in the classics . He has worked with the best - Olivier , Gielgud , Richardson , and Ashcroft , among them . Coming to directing with a strong academic interest in Elizabethan English , acquired at Cambridge University , he has long made it a personal mission to train actors in their delivery of the Bard ' s difficult verse ; he dispels the notion that British thespians have a built-in facility for it. // ' ' England is full of fine actors who can ' t play Shakespeare , ' ' Hall comments . ' ' There are a few who can . The reason so many can ' t is because they ' ve either never done Shakespeare , or they haven ' t done it properly . ' ' Speaking Shakespearean verse properly is like learning a dance , says Hall : ' ' It ' s not normal speech . If you try to make Shakespeare ' real , ' it gets up and strangles you . You breathe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and the audience can ' t understand it. ' ' // Hall is an avid crusader for what he calls ' ' militant classicism . ' ' In practical terms , this means having actors spend at least two weeks just going over every line of the play , learning how each phrase is shaped and formed , how it scans , where to breathe , if the line has an antithesis , what the assonance is - to list just some of the mental hoops his players go through. // ' ' Classicism is the tension between form and anarchy , ' ' Hall explains . ' ' Classicism in Shakespeare is suddenly too many words in the line , so that it doesn ' t quite scan , and you have to know why it doesn ' t scan - what ' s the emotional reason . . . . If you were speaking the verse sloppily , you wouldn ' t even notice. ' ' // Hall has one particularly fond ambition which , if all continues to go well with his new transatlantic venture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bard on Broadway. // ' ' I ' ve always wanted to do a Shakespeare play in America , with American actors , ' ' he says . ' ' I think the American accent is more like the Elizabethan accent , and the vowel sounds and the music of American speech are much richer than modern ( British ) English . It would be , I think , much more resonant and closer to Shakespeare ' s music . That is , if the aforesaid American actors learn to speak the verse correctly , with a sense of rhythm , and , of course , articulate it properly. ' ' // //
