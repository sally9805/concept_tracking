The agreement , announced at 12 : 48 A.M. today by Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink , broke a deadlock over the Governor ' s plan to reserve 10 percent of all contracts awarded under the bond issue - up to $400 million when matching Federal funds are included - for minority-owned companies. // The deadlock was the last major obstacle to a wrap-up of the sixmonth-old session of the Legislature . The State Senate recessed early Monday morning , but the Assembly remained here into the early hours today , passing bills and waiting for the outcome of negotiations over the bond issue. // // Opposed as Quotas // Republicans in the Senate had blocked efforts to include the Governor ' s plan for requiring the awarding of contracts to minority businesses in the law authorizing the bond issue . The Republicans called the proposal a state policy favoring quotas for special groups , while black and Hispanic legislators had vowed to fight the bond issue proposal unless the program , known as a set-aside , was adopted. // The impasse was broken by new langauge that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from minority groups in the Democratic-controlled Assembly. // Under the compromise , no numerical figures will appear in the law , but the Governor will be authorized to issue an executive order setting up a program for minority-owned businesses . The executive order will reguire that contracts go to companies with black or Hispanic owners or to concerns owned by women . <> <> An Affirmative-Action Aide // The Governor also agreed to appoint an aide to be specifically responsible for affirmative action and minority business efforts , according to Roger L. Green , a Democratic Assemblyman from Brooklyn and negotiator for the Legislature ' s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. // " I am very satisfied , " he said . " This will offer the minority business community very good opportunities . " The Assembly passed the measure at 2 : 20 this morning and the Senate has agreed to adopt it on July 12 , when it is scheduled to return for a brief session. // The members of the Senate left town at dawn Monday after a grueling night that many legislators described as among the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst closing in my memory , " said the Senate Republican leader , Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton , who has been a member of the Senate since 1953. // " It ' s just hard , " said Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan , the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate , " because everything ' s been left to the last day. " // Shortly before sunrise Monday , both houses passed a measure making sweeping changes in the rent-stabilization laws . Passage came after a day and night of political maneuvering in which the rent-law agreement almost fell apart under pressure from both tenant and landlord groups. // The Senate recessed a short time later , but Mr. Anderson told his members that they would have to return on July 12 to take up unfinished business , including the confirmation of several of Mr. Cuomo ' s recent appointees. // The Assembly reconvened Monday afternoon , with Mr. Fink , a Brooklyn Democrat , promising his exhausted members , who have been here for eight straight days , that the work of the house would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extraordinary Session ' // Despite the unfinished work , the Governor summoned reporters to his office and hailed the 206th session of the Legislature . " By almost every standard , it has been an extraordinary session and an extraordinarily productive one , " Mr. Cuomo said. // At a 6 A.M. news conference , the Governor said he was confident that the problems delaying the bond issue would be resolved . " We will get the bond issue , " he asserted. // The bond issue was a central feature of Mr. Cuomo ' s first State of the State Message in January , when he said the improvement projects it would allow " are essential to an enduring economic recovery in every region of the state. " // The bond issue would go on the ballot in November . It would provide $1 billion for road and bridge repairs and construction , $170 million for mass transit and $75 million for ports and waterways . <> <> Similar Language // The problems arose when the Governor included the requirement that at least 10 percent of the contracts awarded under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the language was similar to Federal legislation approved by President Reagan and that he therefore did not think it would be difficult to adopt in New York. // But the Republican-controlled Senate balked at this , proposing instead the language used in legislation authorizing construction borrowing by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority . The Senate called for " meaningful participation " in the construction projects by minority contractors and a " fair share of contracts to such enterprises. " // This was considered unacceptable , however , by the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus , which met repeatedly with Mr. Cuomo in an effort to fashion a compromise . <> <> ' A Quota Problem ' // " It is a quota problem , " said Cheryl Ishmael , director of fiscal studies for the Senate Republicans . " We want to make sure we get something for our community , " said Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro , Democrat of Manhattan , the chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. // Before leaving , the Senate passed a bill to put the bond issue on the ballot , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this measure , waiting for a compromise. // One proposed compromise fashioned by the Governor ' s staff would have taken the disputed language out of the bill . Instead , under the proposal the Governor would be given the authority in the law to issue an executive order establishing a minority business program. // But the Senate resisted this . " It gives him the authority to do whatever he wants to do , " Miss Ishmael said . A new compromise was drafted Monday night , and at about 10 : 30 P.M. the Governor ' s secretary , Michael J. Del Giudice , went to meet with the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus members to discuss it. // When the $1. 25 billion in bond proceeds are combined with other Federal and state funds , they will provide for more than $7 billion in construction projects , according to budget officials. // Senate aides said about 60 percent of the projects were covered by Federal provisions , which varied from one section of Federal law to another . They said they were particularly concerned about minority participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to import people from out of state , " one Senate aide said , " when people in the state don ' t have jobs ?
