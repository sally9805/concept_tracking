Workers turn to passive resistance as a weapon against martial law <P> Tanks will not make us work . " <P> So vowed Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa 16 months ago , when asked about the danger of Soviet intervention . He was right , even though the last important strike or sit-in against Poland 's three-week-old martial law regime ended at the Piast mine in Silesia last week when 1,100 weary and hungry workers decided to give up their demonstration after occupying their mineshaft for 14 days . But across Poland , a wave of passive resistance was beginning to swell . In Szczecin , dockworkers were reported to be loading and unloading the same goods over and over again ; at the Zeran auto plant in Warsaw , workers were said to be making parts that would not fit together . <P> As the new year began , the government announced that nine Solidarity leaders had been given prison sentences of up to seven years for organizing strikes or engaging in other illegal activities . The government also dismissed 90 provincial officials for failing to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of passive resistance , the authorities distributed red-and-black posters calling on Poles to support the military regime by working hard . " Help the forces of law-and-order combat anarchy and lawlessness , " declared the signs . <P> In reply , an underground Solidarity group in Silesia published a sort of manual of passive protest . Samples : " In organizing strikes , do not elect leaders , so as to avoid later police action . Work slowly , complain about the mess and the inefficiency of your superiors . Flood the army and the commissars with questions and pretend to be a halfwit . Follow meticulously the most ridiculous instructions . " Every worker , it concluded , should remember these words : " I know only what I need to know . " Nobody outside Poland knows to what extent these opposition efforts are succeeding , but even the government admitted last week that production has declined since the imposition of martial law on Dec. 13 . <P> The country remained in stalemate . <P> Outwardly , at least , Poland was calmer than at any time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TIME correspondent that their villages had never really been touched by martial law . But most Poles were still unable to move freely outside the region in which they live , make telephone calls or receive uncensored mail . Every evening at 10:45 the streets and highways were suddenly transformed into speedways as thousands of Poles rushed toward home to beat the 11 p.m. curfew . A considerable number-5,500 according to the government , and as many as ten times that number according to other sources-did not get home at all because they were still being held at one or another of the 78 detention camps reportedly set up throughout the country . <P> An information center was said to be operating at St. Martin 's Church in Warsaw , where people could learn what happened to relatives and friends and could even arrange to send them parcels . Priests were being allowed into a few of the camps . Some detainees told horror stories of the brutality of the militia , whose members sometimes carry special steel-cored nightsticks capable of breaking bones .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
