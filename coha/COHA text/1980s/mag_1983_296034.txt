As everyone knows , there are no bad boys ; there are only bad film makers . When Screenwriter Richard DiLello and Director Rick Rosenthal made this year 's film about the tough life of reform-school inmates , they determined to refer not to life but to all the other movies that have preceded them down melodrama 's last mile . Sean Penn ( memorable as the spaced-out surfer in last year 's Fast Times at Ridgemont High ) plays the youth who recognizes his own decency and sensitivity about two hours after the audience has been tipped to it . Penn is fine ; so are most of his companions in misery . But waiting for this film to embrace every known generic clich is like serving an indeterminate sentence : you know it has to end but can not understand why that should n't happen a whole lot sooner than it does .
