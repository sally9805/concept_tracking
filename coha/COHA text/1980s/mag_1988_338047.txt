David Puttnam had a good idea when he took over Columbia Pictures in 1986 . He would match Hollywood actors with daring directors from Britain , Europe and the U.S. independent bloc . The films that emerged from this cultural Marshall Plan in reverse might not be better than the usual teenpix and dime-novel dramas , but they ought to be more exciting . <P> Puttnam left Columbia last fall , before he could harvest the fruits of his scheme . But if he looks at A Time of Destiny , with two Oscar-winning actors ( William Hurt and Timothy Hutton ) and the team that made the off-Hollywood hit El Norte , he will be spinning in his golden parachute . The film is a mess . <P> As World War II heats up , the Larranetas of San Diego are already aboil . Papa ( Francisco Rabal ) is a Basque-born tyrant . Josie , his pretty daughter ( Melissa Leo ) , is eloping with G.I. Jack ( Hutton ) . Martin , the unloved son ( Hurt ) , is so bent on winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he follows Jack to Italy , and back home , with murder in mind . <P> With its purloined letters , incestuous jealousies and galloping neuroses , A Time of Destiny spins enough plot for a year of Falcon Crest , then filches its climax from Hitchcock 's Vertigo and Saboteur . So how come nothing works ? Maybe because this family farrago is played for keeps , instead of for the laughs it accidentally evokes . <P> Writer-Producer Anna Thomas and Writer-Director Gregory Nava have swathed their story in the amber sunsets of nostalgia . But this patina has the same effect on the winceable dialogue and agitated performances as lacquer on attic furniture . The farce of Destiny proves , yet again , that the road to dull is paved with bad pretensions .  --  R.C.
