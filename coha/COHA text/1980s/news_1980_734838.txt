txt President-elect Reagan 's transition team at the Pentagon , true to the campaign commitment to build up the military , is calling for an increase of as much as $20 billion in the fiscal 1981 defense budget . The money would go largely toward reinstating the B-1 bomb . er program killed by President Carter in 1977 and constructing a mobile basing system for existing Minuteman missiles . This recommendation is bound to touch off a fight , even within the Reagan administration , because it raises fundamental questions about the priorities for one next four years . ? The most straightforward question is whether the federal government can afford an extra $20 billion this quickly and , if not , whether $20 billion in trims from other budget items will be available to offset it . President-elect Reagan has promised to cut income taxes , reduce the federal deficit , and increase defense spending , and the transition team recommendation puts him early to the test of whether his adridnistration has confidence in its untried economic theory of supply side stimulus and in its political ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the best first use of increased defense spending Is on large capital programs such as the B-1 bomber . The Minuteman mobility program ? whatever its technical and strategic problems ? at least confronts a relatively immediate need that will eventually have to be met by the expensive MX missile deployment if not by the quicker plan to bide Minuteman missiles from inchreasingly accurate Soviet warheads . But B-1 is another matter . One of the problems with the B-1 bomber from the very beginning has been its enormous cost per plane . R was to be a superbomber , crammed with sophisticated electronic gear to counter Soviet detection methods and capable of great versatility . President Carter decided to scrap it in favor of the cruise missile on the theory that it is better to have a greater number of less expensive craft to fire into Soviet airspace than a few extraordinarily expensive bombers . Before the Reagan administration goes ahead with a B-1 revival , it ought to consider seriously this argument . Moreover , it may well be that the so-called " stealth " bomber technology will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Air Force 's arsenal . The choice between B-1 and " stealth " must be weighed carefully . Finally , the Reagan administration ought not rush into new capital programs in the Pentagon without first deciding whether the money would sot be better spent right now in eliminating some serious problems in readiness . Pay for the middle and upper enlisted ranks must be increased sharply if good and highly-trained service personnel are to remain in uniform . The aircraft we already have need spare parts and fuel so that they can be more fully used in training missions . There is the question of air transport and mobility to make our existing forces a more potent deterrent in areas of the world far from their home bases . Defense Secretary-designate Casper Weinberger can not relish the possibility that be may have to turn down the B-1 bomber , which has become a symbol of President Carter 's unwillingness to provide adequately for the national security . But he has a reputation for handling such tough budget choices well . And be should not ? be put into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be an issue that will set the basic course for the Reagan defense policy .
