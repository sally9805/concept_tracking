Most big computer makers are expected to report robust earnings for the latest quarter , securities analysts say . In particular , personal-computer companies are expected to post exceptional gains . Mainframe makers also did reasonably well . Minicomputer companies , however , are expected to report mixed results . And all types of computer companies continued to face problems in the U.S. , where stiff competition has pushed prices and profits down . International Business Machines Corp. is generally expected to report second-quarter earnings of $2. 15 to $2. 25 a share before a special charge , up from the year-earlier $1. 18 billion , or $1. 95 a share , showing that IBM is continuing to make slow , steady progress in its turnaround . Net income fell , however , after a charge of 60 to 65 cents a share related to IBM ' s recent announcement of a program that will probably cut 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 jobs . Revenue probably rose 5. 5% to 8. 6% from the year-earlier $12. 8 billion . " IBM has been undergrowing the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Steve Milunovich , an analyst at First Boston Corp . Steve Cohen , an analyst at Gartner Securities Corp. , said IBM pushed hard to win mainframe business in the second quarter ; " it ' s sort of , take it now and pay later , " he said . He added that he thinks IBM has nearly depleted its backlog of mainframe orders as a result and will take the unusual step of announcing enhanced versions of its mainframes during the summer doldrums to try to stir up interest . He said the announcement of the long-rumored machines probably will come between July 26 and Aug. 15 . He said customers tell him the machines will offer 20% to 25% more power than current models and will carry 8% to 10% price increases over current models . IBM ' s personal-computer shipments apparently increased 30% to 40% in the quarter , and were even stronger in Europe , though competition limited revenue and profit gains . IBM ' s midrange computers muddled along , with the 9370 gathering steam only slowly . Software revenue continued its 20% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about flat . Daniel Mandresh , an analyst at Merrill Lynch &; Co. who thinks IBM ' s U.S. revenue actually declined in the quarter , said the dollar ' s strengthening toward the end of the quarter also hurt the Armonk , N.Y. , concern . Assuming the dollar has hit bottom , he said , IBM and other multinational computer companies will convert their overseas revenue and profit into dollars at lower rates in coming quarters , reversing the substantial benefits they ' ve received in recent years . While European sales strengthened results of many computer concerns during the first half of the year , there are signals of trouble in the European market . Smaller concerns such as Apollo Computer Inc . , Chelmsford , Mass . ; Norsk Data Systems of Norway and Genrad Inc. , a Concord , Mass. - based maker of circuit board testers , last week said that weaker-than-expected European sales hurt results . Susie Case , a First Boston Corp. analyst , downgraded her ratings of several minicomputer stocks for the second half as a result . Digital Equipment Corp. is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in its fourth quarter , ended June 30 , up a bit from $377. 3 million , or $2. 85 a share , a year earlier . Digital , of Maynard , Mass. , had disappointed analysts in its fiscal third quarter , when costs rose faster than sales and it reported a slight earnings decline on a 17% revenue increase . But Mrs. Case said , " Digital has reined in its ( cost ) growth , " and estimated that sales rose 23% to $3. 28 billion from $2. 67 billion . Among the factors boosting the minicomputer maker were sales of its powerful VAX 8800 computers , which were introduced in March , too late to help the fiscal third quarter . In addition , Stephen Dube , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton , said that sales of low-end engineering workstations have been " extremely strong " and the midrange VAX 6200 system , introduced in April , has been selling well . Digital is expected to introduce new software for commercial use July 19 , and that may boost business further , analysts said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases by posting earnings of 70 cents to 80 cents a share for the second quarter , up from the year-earlier $121. 2 million , or 62 cents a share fully diluted . The Blue Bell , Pa. , company continued to benefit from cost savings that resulted from the merger of Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp . The fact that many of its minicomputers are relatively new also meant that they were tapping pent-up demand and were partly insulated from the problems facing competitors ' products . Revenue , however , is expected to have risen just 3% to 4% from $2. 28 billion . NCR Corp. also maintained its momentum , with analysts estimating it earned $1. 25 to $1. 45 a share , up from the year-earlier $98. 6 million , or $1. 05 a share . Mr. Dube of Shearson Lehman said the company will report a " double-digit " revenue increase , with the fastest-growing products being personal computers and the Tower line of workstations that use the Unix operating system . Even Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected to post strong gains despite having said last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palo Alto , Calif. , company will earn 76 cents to 82 cents a share in its third quarter , ending July 31 , up from the year-earlier $148 million , or 57 cents a share . Revenue is expected to rise to $2. 3 billion to $2. 6 billion from $2. 05 billion . Richard Edwards , an analyst with Robertson , Colman &; Stephens , said that personal computer and workstation unit sales were especially strong , but at the cost of heavy discounts . Other minicomputer companies fared less well , however . Wang Laboratories Inc. of Lowell , Mass. , is expected to report that earnings fell to 12 cents to 16 cents a share in its fourth quarter , ended June 30 , from the year-earlier $32 million , or 20 cents a share . Mrs. Case of First Boston estimates that fourth-quarter revenue about equaled last year ' s $824 million . Data General Corp . , Westboro , Mass. , continues to rebound , following restructuring and big losses last year . But , " on the whole , business remains relatively flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third quarter , ended June 25 , analysts expect it to report profit of 25 cents to 35 cents a share from operations , compared with a net loss of $65. 1 million on revenue of $313. 6 million a year earlier . Prime Computer Inc . , Natick , Mass. , is expected to report that earnings fell to 24 cents to 28 cents a share in the second quarter , from $15. 7 million , or 32 cents a share . The lower earnings reflect the costs of absorbing Computervision Corp. , which was acquired in February . Tandem Computers Inc. , which sells midrange machines for such large tasks as airline-reservation systems , is expected to report earnings of between 26 cents and 33 cents a share for its third quarter , ended June 30 , flat to up a bit compared with 26 cents a share a year earlier . Analysts expect Tandem , of Cupertino , Calif. , to report revenue of $340 million to $360 million , up from $264 million Among personal-computer companies the news is much more upbeat , with the continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Apple Computer Inc. , enjoying an increasing share of the market for business personal computers , earned 69 cents a share , or an indicated $89 million , in its third quarter ended in late June , according to an estimate by Dillon , Read &; Co. analyst John C. Maxwell III . That would mark a 66% increase from the year-earlier $53. 5 million for the Cupertino , Calif. , company . Likewise , Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $1. 21 a share , up sharply from the year-earlier $30. 7 million , or 80 cents a share , on sales of $267. 5 million . That outlook is helped by increasing sales of more advanced , and thus more expensive , computers built around Intel Corp. ' s 80386 microchip . Sun Microsystems Inc. , a workstation maker that a month ago said it will post earnings of about 47 cents a share and revenue of about $314 million for its fourth quarter , ended June 30 , may have done even better , analysts said . The Mountain View , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments of about $100 million in the period because of the memory-chip shortage . Analysts now say , however , that the company also held down marketing and research costs , maintaining profitability . Mr. Edwards of Robertson , Colman &; Stephens , said he expects Sun to report net income of 50 cents a share , on revenue of about $333 million , up from the year-earlier $9. 8 million , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $186 million . Mainframe maker Amdahl Corp. also continued its recent strong earnings performance in the second quarter , said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst Peter Labe . " I ' m at 92 cents a share ( or $49. 2 million ) , and I expect to be low , " he said . Mr. Labe ' s " conservative " estimate represents a 59% jump in net income for Amdahl , which in the year-earlier period had net of $31 million , or 60 cents a share.  --  - Paul Duke Jr. contributed to this article.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
