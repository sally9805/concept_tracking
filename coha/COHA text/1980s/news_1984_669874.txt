DETROIT  --  General Motors Corp. ' s plan for acquiring Electronic Data Systems Corp. could force the New York Stock Exchange to change its listing requirements or consider delisting GM , one of the most widely held blue-chip stocks . An exchange spokeswoman said it isn ' t clear whether GM ' s plan to issue a new security in connection with the EDS acquisition would put the auto maker in violation of the exchange ' s corporate democracy requirements . She said the exchange is reviewing GM ' s proposal but can ' t make a ruling until the parties complete a definitive agreement . It was understood such an agreement could come as early as this week . GM ' s $2. 55 billion acquisition proposal dramatically intensifies pressure on the exchange concerning restrictions it places on listed companies . But it is expected that the exchange would take any steps necessary to prevent the delisting of a stock as prestigious as GM . The exchange today is expected to announce formation of an executive committee to review such restrictions , including an examination of rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires that all common shares have equal voting rights . GM ' s proposed new Class E common would carry a half-vote . Securities industry officials observe that the exchange ' s rules may be costing it business . Besides the GM matter , other recent cases involve Coastal Corp. , which has said it might be delisted over its creation of a class of common with unequal voting rights , and Dow Jones &; Co. , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , which may be delisted over plans  --  currently held up by litigation  --  to create a second class of common with unequal voting rights . It would be a considerably weightier matter if the GM-EDS proposal were found to be in violation of exchange rules . Some market analysts follow the ups and downs of GM common as a guide to the future movements of the market as a whole . And GM has been a significant component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks since its formulation in 1928 . A delisting of GM would require a reformulation of the index ' s divisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GM-EDS proposal presents a somewhat murky issue for the exchange . " We are in the process of reviewing what they propose to do , " a spokeswoman said . " It isn ' t a totally cut and dried proposition . Until we are sure what the company is proposing to do , we can ' t make any decision or statement . " The spokeswoman described the exchange ' s rules as requiring " essentially that all common shares would have equal voting rights . It also is defined as all shares having voting rights equal to their equity contribution . " As initially described , the GM Class E common would be linked to the performance of GM ' s EDS unit , rather than that of the parent company . It would have half the liquidation rights of GM common . GM proposes initially to issue as many as 13. 6 million Class E shares in the EDS takeover , and within the first year to issue as many as four times that number . GM currently has about 315 million common shares outstanding . A GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work out . " He said , " In putting together the EDS deal , the parties tried to structure the Class E stock not to be in conflict within NYSE regulations , which we were aware of . " The GM spokesman also indicated that GM doesn ' t want its common taken off the Big Board . He observed that GM proposed to list the new Class E issue on either the over-the-counter market or on a " national securities exchange . " The Big Board spokeswoman said exchange rules wouldn ' t permit GM ' s regular common to continue on the Big Board while the Class E common was listed elsewhere . It was understood that GM may argue that its proposed Class E common wouldn ' t violate the intent of the exchange ' s so-called one-share , one-vote rule because of the Class E stock ' s unusual linkage to a specific subsidiary . GM may suggest that the existing rule be interpreted to permit the new class , it was understood . At the same time , industry sources observed that there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rules or make an exception . " I ' m sure the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq ( the National Association of Securities Dealers ' automated over-the-counter trading system ) would be glad to have GM , " commented one industry official .
