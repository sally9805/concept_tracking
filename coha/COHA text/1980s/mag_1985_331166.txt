For nearly half an hour , five customs officials carefully inspected her four suitcases . They counted her foreign currency  --  lire and dollars  --  and raised their eyebrows at the four jars of caviar she had with her , before a guard finally checked her travel documents . Then , for the first time in six years , Yelena Bonner , 62 , wife of Soviet Dissident Andrei Sakharov , was finally free to leave the Soviet Union . <P> The trip marked a victory for the Sakharovs . Ever since Bonner had been forced to join her husband in exile in the city of Gorky ( pop . 1.4 million ) in May 1984 , he had waged a campaign of letter writing and hunger strikes to secure an exit visa for Bonner , who suffers from glaucoma and heart trouble , so that she might receive medical treatment in the West . Before she left for Italy , where she consulted her ophthalmologist , then met briefly with Premier Bettino Craxi and Pope John Paul II prior to leaving for heart treatment in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the condition that she not talk to the press . " I have to be able to come back , " she told reporters . " I know you do n't want to see Andrei left on his own any more than I do . " <P> Family members who met Bonner in Italy did not feel similarly bound . At a press conference in Rome , Alexei Semyonov , Bonner 's son by her first marriage , and her son-in-law Efrem Yankelevich offered a glimpse of the painful isolation that has been endured by the Sakharovs , who were kept under constant surveillance by police . Neighbors and shopkeepers were barred from talking to them . Bonner and Sakharov , 64 , were separated at least twice . When the Soviet government released film footage purportedly showing the Sakharovs strolling through Gorky last summer , he was actually on a hunger strike in Semashko Hospital , where Soviet doctors resorted to force-feeding him through the nose . The couple tried to get out word of their plight , but their messages were often altered to give the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip as a gesture of goodwill before last month 's summit between President Reagan and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev . At those talks , however , Gorbachev showed no signs that he is ready to ease restrictions on dissidents or would-be emigres . President Reagan made it equally clear that substantial changes in the Soviet attitude on human rights are essential before there can be any significant improvement in superpower relations .
