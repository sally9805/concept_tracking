 | It was in June 1982 , during Princess Anne 's official visit to the United States , that rumors of a rift between the queen 's only daughter and her sister-inlaw , Princess Diana , began to surface . There were incidents that seemed to give the rumors credibility . As Anne was visiting Indian pueblos in New Mexico , for example , a reporter asked , " Has your Royal Highness any word about Princess Diana ? " At the time Diana was in her last month of pregnancy , her first baby due any minute . Princess Anne turned to the reporter and snapped , " I do n't know . You tell me . " And later , after Princess Diana had given birth to Prince William , another member of the press asked Anne how she liked being an aunt . " That 's my business , thank you very much , " the princess retorted . " Ah , " said the world , " Diana and Anne do n't get on . " And that , many felt , was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being illtempered and rude , while Diana was the opposite . But , as a matter of fact , Princess Diana and Princess Anne do get on . They have a perfectly amicable relationship . They are not the best of friends , but remember , Anne is 11 years older than Diana and their interests and personalities are so different , it would be surprising indeed if they had become intimate friends . In truth , it was not Diana that was making Anne snappish that hot day in New Mexico . Rather , it was the impertinence of the press . Princess Anne does not easily tolerate reporters . Any questions she considers @# inappropriate for royalty , such as inquiries about other members of the family , get what the English call " a dusty answer . " And Anne is royal , however casual the private life she has chosen with her husband , Captain Mark Phillips . So even if she had known of Prince William 's arrival on June 21 , 1982 , she was not going to chat about it with strangers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family , one must remember that the most important aspect of life for royalty is the family unit itself . The Windsors are a close-knit clan , creating their own circle apart from the outside world . It is only with each other that they can be relaxed , calling each other by their Christian names , for example . ( In public Anne and Diana must refer to Charles as the Prince of Wales . ) It is usually during the long holidays that the family is together . Princess Diana and Princess Anne spend Christmas , Easter , and Ascot Week in June at Windsor Castle . There they have separate apartments in their own towers and meet with the queen for all meals ( except breakfast ) . They also spend evenings together . The two princesses are also together for a six-week winter holiday at Sandringham in Norfolk and a 10-week summer holiday at Balmoral Castle in Scotland . And they take part with other members of the royal family in a cruise of the Western Isles of Scotland on the royal yacht , Britannia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all the Windsors like each other without  | reservation . Such a large group ( 28 at last count ) will obviously break into smaller , compatible units , but in the end they recognize that they are members of the same family . If Anne and Diana are not bosom pals , enjoying cosy chats at these family gatherings , it is because they are such different women . It is hard to imagine what they would talk about . Nowhere are the differences between the two princesses more apparent than in their homes . Princess Diana and Princess Anne are near neighbors , with country homes in what is now known as " Royal Gloucestershire " because so many members of the royal family live in that county . Princess Diana 's home , Highgrove , is a mansion that Prince Charles bought in 1981 for ? 800,000 . It stands in an estate of 347 acres , which includes a large farm with cottages , a dairy unit , and a stable block . Diana has decorated it to her own taste , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne and her husband live at Gatcombe Park , a country estate the queen bought for them as a wedding present ( for ? 600,000 ) in 1974 . Gatcombe , which includes an 840-acre farm , is totally informal , run like the household of any gentleman farmer and his wife , and filled with " horsey " paraphernalia . In Gloucestershire Anne 's evenings are often spent with friends who share her passion for riding . Diana and Charles spend their Highgrove evenings watching television in their drawing room . If the prince goes fox hunting , as he often does when in the country , the princess either stays at home or follows him by Land Rover . But it is not a sport she enjoys . Nor does she enjoy riding . The queen has given Diana riding lessons at Sandringham , but the project seems doomed to failure because Princess Diana had a bad fall from a pony when she was a child and has been wary of horses ever since . But then she does not care for any of the country pursuits ? shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family 's collective heart . Princess Anne , on the other hand . loves horses and rides to Olympic standard . And one of her favorite ways of relaxing is to exercise the horses . ( Diana 's favorite way of relaxing is to embroider cushions , which she does beautifully . ) Though their country houses are only 10 miles apart ? no distance even in the rather elderly cars all the royals seem to prefer ? Diana and Anne are not particularly neighborly . There is little in the way of popping over for drinks or tea , for example . But Princess Diana always attends the children 's parties at  | Gatcombe Park . And when Princess Anne is away ( she undertakes many grueling trips for the Save the Children Fund , of which she is president ) , Diana drops in to see how Anne 's childrensix-year-old Peter and three-year-old Zara ? are doing without their mother . It seems likely too that when Diana 's children are old enough to play with their cousins , there will be more visits between the two houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . If she needs to stay in London for a night or two , she " puts up with " Buckingham Palace . ( The royals loathe having to spend time at the palace , which they consider gloomy and uncomfortable . Diana , however , is a town girl , with a triplex apartment in Kensington Palace ? convenient to the Royal Opera House , where she loves to watch the ballet , and not far from her favorite shopping area , Knightsbridge . Diana loves to shop . At the time of her wedding she was spending a fortune on clothes ( it was her own cash , incidentally , as she came into money of her own when she turned 18 ) . She is always immaculately groomed and beautifully made up . Princess Anne is really quite indifferent to clothes . On a recent trip to Australia , someone remarked that she was wearing a suit that she had worn on a previous visit in 1978 . " Oh , it 's older than that , " Anne rejoined cheerfully . She does dress smartly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clothes she wears a. home on the farm ? a sweater and jeans or jodhpurs , with her hair tied back . Different tastes in homes and hobbies and clothes only suggest the more basic personality differences between the two princesses . Both young women are strong and both are used to getting their own way , but their methods are very different . Anne says exactly what she feels ? and forcibly . Diana listens . lowers her eyelashes , and those who know her well realize what she is thinking . Even in her school days Diana quietly managed to avoid doing anything she did not want to do , but in the words of her headmistress , " She was a nice little girl who was always kind and cheerful . " As a child Princess Anne was a little devil . She was impudent and rebellious . Quick herself , she was impatient with her slower brother , forever yelling at him , " Oh , do come on , Charles ! " The British public adored this naughty little princess , with her mop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grew less enthusiastic as she grew up . Several years ago Anne was " votANNE &; DIANA continued ed " Britain 's most disliked royal . In an opinion poll nearly one person in two put the unsmiling , petulant princess at the bottom of their list . It was Diana the public clamored to see , and Anne seemed left out in the cold . Once , for example , Princess Anne undertook a dangerous engagement visiting the British troops in Northern Ireland , and not a word was mentioned in the daily press . Diana , though , earned a front-page story with no more than a simple appearance . But Anne was determined to show that she had a place in the structure in the monarchy and that she was determined to keep it . And she has done that by hard work . Anne receives about $147,000 per year from the government , and she believes in earning that salary . Last year the princess undertook 244 official engagements and six overseas visits ? more than any other member of her family . And the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishingly , Anne came out higher in the public 's regard than Diana ! The public is beginning to respect and even love Anne for the work she has done . As president of the Save the Children Fund , Anne could sit at home , fund raising at teas . Instead she has undertaken tours that once would have been unthinkable for a princess : She 's visited impoverished countries , even leper colonies . No glamour , just hard work ? seeing what needs to be done . And never complaining . Anne may now be overshadowed by her sister-in-law , but there are those in Britain who privately think that her direct approach , hard work , and courage will bring her the attention that Diana now receives . " As the Princess of Wales becomes more involved with babies , " a member of the royal household confided to me , " Princess Anne will come into the spotlight . " Princess Anne has shown , the member of the royal household continues , " grit , guts , and staying power . " She also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have realized . As she learns to curb some of her sharper comments and even to enjoy bantering with the press and public . people will begin to see those nicer qualities . And people will also see that there is room for two popular princesses . That Anne and Diana are not bosom pals does not mean there will be a lifelong feud . It does mean that they are two very different women . And each is worthy of admiration in her own way .
