 | In 1985 Janet Hicks was n't sure what her two daughters looked like anymore . They 'd been abducted by their father in 1977 , when they were just 5 and 7 years old , and never seen again . Scott Barrows and Lewis Sadler had never met them at all . But working from old photographs and their knowledge of how faces change , the two medical illustrators cobbled together portraits of the teenagers the girls might have become . The pictures showed up on TV one night , and within 10 minutes a national hot line was getting calls from neighbors and school officials in Kettering , Ohio , who knew the girls as Cathy and Debbi Russo . By 7:30 the next morning , the girls were in police custody . Their father , Philip Caruso , was under arrest . Penciling years into pictures has since become a sort of specialty for Barrows and Sadler . From their lab at the University of Illinois , Chicago , they 've conjured images of 81 missing children , and seen 29 recovered . One reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60,000 or more vanished kids is that it 's so tedious . Until now , each portrait has taken an artist up to 20 hours with rulers , pencils and transparent overlays . But that changed dramatically last week , when the illustrators unveiled their newly minted computer system . Supplied with a photograph , the new system will add the needed number of years and produce a transformed likeness within minutes . " If there 's been a single revolutionary leap in my 20 years of experience with missing children , this is probably it , " says John Rabun of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . " We 're going to see a marked increase in the number of kids who are located . " The seeming magic all stems from the fact that facial bones change in predictable ways throughout childhood . Barrows and Sadler have computed the average changes for 39 facial dimensions , such as the length of the nose , the width of the mouth and the space between the eyes . They know , for example , that the distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin typically increases 12 percent between the ages of 6 and 13 . The trick is to apply these general principles to particular faces . The beauty of the new computer system is that it mechanizes the grunt work . First , a laser scanner creates a copy of the photo-@# graph . The computer then digitizes the scanned image and displays it on a monitor , along with a menu of the 39 needed measurements . To supply the measurements , the operator simply marks appropriate points on the face with a light pen . The computer then breaks the face into a map of about 100 puzzle pieces and applies the normal growth pattern for each piece . The new machine is almost as flexible as it is fast . There 's no limit to the number of years it could add to a face ; since bone structure changes little during adulthood , turning a 25-year-old into an 85-year-old is just a matter of showing the decay of skin , muscle , teeth and hair . The system can restore youth as quickly as it confers age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females . Unfortunately , it does n't register racial differences . Many features , such as the width of the nose and the shape of the skull , vary considerably from one race to the next . But because Barrows and Sadler relied on data from a study of children in Iowa , their system is geared mainly to Caucasians . Barrows says he still hopes to amass better data on blacks , who account for about half of all missing children . Meanwhile , frivolity beckons . Tabloids have asked Barrows and Sadler to produce portraits of John Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe as senior citizens . And one Wall Streeter said he would pay any price to see what his 2- and 3-year-old sons would look like as adults . Barrows foresees the day when people will do much of this at home on their personal computers . But for now . he 's more interested in missing children . This week , after months of test cases , he and Sadler will add five years to a picture of Nyleen Marshall of Clancy , Mont. , who vanished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If nothing else , the new machine may provide a flicker of hope for her and others . " This opens the files again , " says Barrows . " They can be considered alive again . "
