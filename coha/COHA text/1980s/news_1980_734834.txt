txt The Supreme Court handed the nation 's federal judges a hefty Christmas bonus in the form of a pay raise , but the judiciary lost an important legal battle in the process . The Justices ruled without ins , sent that the . more than 600 federal judges at every level , including the Supreme Court , are constitutionally entitled to pay raises for fiscal years that ended Sept. 30 , 1977 and 1980 . However , in an opinion by Chief Justice Warren Burger the high court found that Congress has the power to withhold pay raises from federal judges without . violating the Constitution , as long as Congress acts before the start of the fiscal year in question . The high court ruled yesterday in a case brought by 13 federal judges who said that Congress unconstitutionally ' denied them cost-of-living increases . Their argument was based on a section of the Constitution that says the compensation of judges ca n't be " diminished during their continuance in office . " Another 9.1% Is Likely Unofficial estimates issued by the Administrative Office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decision , the salary of district court judges will increase to ** a year from $54,500 ; federal appeals court judges to $65,000 from $57,500 ; Supreme Court Justices to $81,300 from $72,000 , and the Chief Justice to $84,700 from $75,000 . But based on the rationale of yesterday 's ruling , the judges probably are in line to receive still another increase of 9.1% for the current fiscal year , 1981 , which was n't directly involved in the case . That would bring a district court judge 's pay to $67,205 . Also , a federal commission that meets every four years to recommend new federal salary levels to the President is likely to report soon , boosting judges ' pay even higher if the President accepts the recommendation . Under the complex statutory plan for setting salaries , cost-of-living increases were approved by the President for , fiscal years , 1977 , 1978 , 1979 and 1980 . But in each year , Congress acted to freeze or delay those increases for top-level federal employes ' . Although other employes are affected by the congressional freezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are protected by the Constitution from having their salary " diminished . " The suit by the judges charged that the freezes imposed by Congress amount to a reduction in salary level . A federal judge in Illinois ruled in favor of the judges , and the Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court . Blackmun Skips Case The high court , with Justice Harry Blackmun skipping the case , ruled that the judges had a constitutional right to the increases of 4.8% in fiscal year 1977 and 7% in fiscal year 1980 . The reason was that Congress did n't freeze those raises until after the fiscal years had begun . The case also raised another problem that the high court addressed at some length . Because every federal judge at every level is directly affected by the outcome , every one of them has a conflict of interest . But the Supreme Court-said there is a " rule of necessity " dating back to English common law that allows the court to settle the case despite the conflicts when that is the only way it can be resolved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in Illinois to calculate the actual salary levels in question .
