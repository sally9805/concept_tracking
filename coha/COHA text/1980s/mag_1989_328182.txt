When the silver-plated telephone rings in Marina Osadchuk 's clothing and beauty boutique , it chirps like a canary . These days it sounds as if a cageful of canaries has been let loose in Osadchuk 's store in Moscow . People call constantly to inquire about the handmade suits and dresses , priced at 200 to 700 rubles ( $320 to $1,120 ) , or to make appointments to get their hair done for 15 rubles ( $24 ) . With 50 customers a day , Osadchuk has more business than she can handle . <P> Osadchuk 's eager clientele largely represents a new class of Soviet consumer : the nouveau riche , of which she is a proud member . Better yet , call them yuccies  --  young upwardly mobile Communists . Osadchuk pays herself a monthly salary of 700 rubles , or $1,120 , about three times the average Soviet salary and enough for her family to live very comfortably . Says she : " We buy anything we want . " Thanks to the co-op movement , employee profit sharing and other budding forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do more than just scrape by . They are enjoying a taste of the good life , and some are even becoming wealthy , at least by Soviet standards . <P> Yet the fling with materialism is problematic in a country that has officially scorned materialism and has trouble producing enough basic goods , much less luxury items . Even such Western staples as cars , refrigerators and washing machines are in chronically short supply . As a result , well-off Soviets often have much more money than they need for smaller indulgences , including restaurant meals , videos and stereo gear . " Money slips through our fingers , " says Vladimir Ivlev , chairman of a Moscow clothing cooperative that pays him a monthly salary of 2,000 rubles ( $3,200 ) . <P> Ivlev , who often wears imported jeans and Adidas sneakers , has richly furnished the three-room apartment he shares with his wife Tanya and son Sergei . A sleek , ebony-colored bookcase holds a Korean color TV and matching video system . Ivlev says he paid 1,000 rubles ( $1,600 ) for a Panasonic tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop at the open market , where prices are higher , " he points out . Is their bank account growing ? " It 's not our aim to save money , " says Tanya . " We want to spend as much as we can . " <P> Vladimir Yakovlev , 30 , a former journalist , has cashed in on the co-op movement by starting a company to collect and sell information about such ventures . Yakovlev launched the firm , called Fakt , two years ago and already has more than 30 offices in the Soviet Union . Yakovlev , who last fall visited the U.S. for the first time to learn more about foreign trade , pays himself 1,500 rubles a month ( $2,400 ) , five times as much as he made as a journalist . His most enviable perk is a company car and driver . " I spend a lot of money every month on clothes and fancy restaurants , " he says . " I have no bank account . No savings . " Consumers have little incentive to save because such major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay interest of only 2% to 4%.
