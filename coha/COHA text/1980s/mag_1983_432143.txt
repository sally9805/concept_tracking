 | Around Revlon , Inc. ' s , New York headquarters , the late Charles Revson was known as El Exigente , the demanding one . His nearly maniacal pursuit of perfection led to a constant turnover of despairing marketing executives , but maddeningly , Revson was usually right . " Revlon was always far ahead of everybody else because of Charles Revson 's ego ? he had to be better than anybody else , " says Suzanne Grayson , a former Revlon marketing executive . Revson 's successors have shown neither the same drive nor the same touch . The company still controls about 20 percent of the cosmetics market and its Charlie and Jontue colognes remain the two biggestselling fragrances ? but its market share has been eroding . Shaken , Revlon is now juggling its star sales force : Lauren Hutton is out after a decade , Joan Collins and model newcomer Kim Alexis are in . But unless the company starts supporting its products with big promotional dollars again , the new campaign is n't likely to perform any better than the old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds of all cosmetics are bought on impulse and sales dwindle when consumer budgets tighten . But Revlon compounded the problem through its own marketing blunders . The company 's ads continued to feature tousled blondes who had appealed to newly independent women in the early ' 70s , while the customers themselves now tend to be serious and successful businesswomen . The more recent ads also rate low on the scale of taste with some critics . " The women look like hookers , " says a former Revlon staffer . " They are hard-edged instead of soft and beautiful . " To a defensive Revlon , however , they have ' stvle , elegance , charm and beauty . " Marketing Mistakes : There seems to be little argument that the company has ignored another trend : it has been slow to expand in skin-care products even though population trends show a preponderance of customers in the over-30 age bracket who worry more about getting wrinkles than owning seven different shades of red lipstick . Not surprisingly , more adroit cornpetitors are nudging Revlon aside , and retailors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " merchandising tactics of the past , are eager to give them display space . L ' 0-real and Noxell have stolen business from Revlon in drugstores and Estee Lauder and Lancome are squeezing the company in department stores . Revlon 's stockholders have been paying dearly for the company 's marketing mistakes . Despite the bull market , Revlon 's stock price is now about 40 percent lower than it was five years ago ? and analysts see nothing in their projections for the company 's cosmetics sales to give them hope for a quick turnaround . Analysts trace Revlon 's troubles to 1975 , the year Michel Bergerac took over as chief executive and Charles Revson died . As a former manager at conglomerate International Telephone and Telegraph , Bergerac naturally wanted to diversify , and he has done so successfully . Half of Revlon 's sales now come from health-care lines : drugs , vision-care products , diagnostic instruments and so-called proprietary products like Turns and NoSalt . But Bergerac has also stunted Revlon 's basic business . He was slow to boost cosmetics advertising , and Wertheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 million of the company 's overall $114 million research budget went into cosmetics . " He 's a numbers man , " says Hill , " and it 's fair to say that he was managing the bottom line more than the beauty business . " The old ITT approach featuring tightly structured budgets and endless meetings may also have stifled the creativity so necessary in the cosmetics business . " I think you can argue that Bergerac 's emphasis on being on target may have created so much pressure that current management decided to take shortcuts to bring in the required numbers , " says Jack Salzman , a cosmetics-industry analyst at Smith , Barney . Bergerac continues to reveal little of his plans to reporters or Wall Street analysts , but the company is fighting back in the marketplace . It has introduced new skincare products , is bringing out a highly touted shampoo , and has raised its 1983 advertising budget for cosmetics to an estimated $40 million from $27 million last year . That 's still a relatively small amount for a company with cosmetics sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on promotion , too . Unless Bergerac can restore something resembling Revson 's old merchandising magic at Revlon , his beloved bottom line wo n't have a very pretty face .
