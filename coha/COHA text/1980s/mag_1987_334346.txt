To hear Marti Brewer tell it , the fact that she made it into the college she wanted is a small miracle . Although a good student , she decided she needed a special summer course to improve her chances . But the counseling office at her high school in Fayetteville , Ark. , bungled the course application by reporting the wrong SAT scores . Fortunately she caught the mistake in time . Looking back on her experience from the safety of Rice University , the freshman-in-spite- of- it-all sighs , " Counselors are overwhelmed with duties . They do n't know how to help . " <P> Marti 's lament is a common one among seniors now coming to the end of their labors and juniors about to start theirs . Some 60% of this spring 's graduates will enroll in college , and though the choice of where to go is the culmination of twelve years of schoolwork , many will make the decision knowing little about the place they choose . They must sort through a choked mailbox of color brochures from student-hungry colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental advice that is based either on no college experience or 20-year-old impressions . Enter the college guidance counselor to champion the student 's cause . Too often , though , such a paladin is battered with overwork . <P> Those assigned to give guidance typically have 400 students to deal with , says Executive Director Frank Burtnett of the National Association of College Admission Counselors , and " unfortunately , in some urban public schools , you will find ratios in excess of 1,000 to 1 . " Many advisers are responsible as well for more dramatic concerns . " We 're dealing with drug problems , alcohol , pregnancy and broken homes , " notes Counselor Jean Brown of Dallas . " We 've got to squeeze all that in too . " Their time is also regularly eaten up by daily snags and such petty bureaucratic requirements as monitoring lunchrooms and scheduling classes . <P> The best counseling , unsurprisingly , tends to be offered in public and private schools attended by the middle class , but even that is often not enough . " Anytime you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , you have parents trying to beat the game , " says Harold Howe II , chairman of the College Board Commission on Precollege Guidance and Counseling . The result is a growing industry in private advisers . Says Barbara Wolfson , who sent her son to a private counselor in Atlanta : " There 's a limit to what the school counselors can do . " For fees of up to $2,500 , private advisers take the time to find out a student 's strengths and interests , put together a list of likely choices and assist with the application process . Most stress that their aim is to help the student find a match with an appropriate college , not package him for acceptance at an elite institution . Says Maurice Salter , a private consultant in Los Angeles : " We work long hours with students . We do n't do anything magical . "
