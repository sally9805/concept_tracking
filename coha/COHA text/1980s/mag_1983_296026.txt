Starting new or starting over , spinning pitches and daydreams <P> If spring is a season for aging veterans and hopeful rookies , this is a particularly auspicious time for Tom Seaver , who is both . After almost six years in Cincinnati , Seaver is back where he began , with the New York Mets , who promise to be as dreadful as they were when Seaver was a rookie in 1967 , the last time they lost 100 games . The question is not whether he will win again at 38 , just whether he will pitch well again after a 5-13 year that aged a lot of people a little . <P> Now , age in baseball is a delicate matter . Pitchers , especially , grip the edges of their careers like the seams of the baseball , and dig in their fingernails . For example Gaylord Perry , 44 , of Seattle , whose next victory will be his 308th , bad news for Charles ( " Old Hoss " ) Radbourn , about to be bumped to 13th after 91 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullpen , is approaching his 25th big-league campaign , dabbling with a new pitch , trying his hand as a submariner . The most enchanting apparition of the spring is Masanori ( " Mashi " ) Murakami , a Japanese lefthander who mystically reappeared with the San Francisco Giants . Mashi has more English now than the all-purpose phrase " Take a hike , " taught to him by his San Francisco teammates in 1965 , the year of his short , happy spin through American baseball , when his record was 4-1 . Patriotism required Murakami 's presence in Japan all the seasons since , but now he is back in a cactus camp , no more inclined to take a hike than his former teammate Perry , and no older than Seaver . <P> Seaver is perched on the edge of a training table in St. Petersburg , Fla. , after pitching five innings against Toronto , allowing four runs in the second inning but none in the others . There is that signature streak of dirt on Seaver 's pant leg below his right knee , residue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not changed so much at that . Most young throwers get to the major leagues with " good stuff ' and only fall back on pitching later . But Seaver could always pitch . <P> In the absence of his fastball , he has been moving the ball around at varying speeds . His shining eyes make it silly to ask if pitching is still fun for him , but he answers anyway . " It 's more complicated than fun , " he says , " more sophisticated than that . But fun , yes . I brought my slider out of the closet today , and I 've been moving my sinker in and away . I feel good . There are puzzles to work out , but it 's enjoyable work . " He is a devotee of puzzles , particularly the crosswords in the New York Times , and has come across himself on occasion . " Bench 's battery-mate . " He lets out a laugh , one of his high-pitched cackles . Johnny Bench still toils in Cincinnati , but he 's not a catcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , mostly to drum up customers , maybe to prepare himself for what he considers a " cerebral challenge " - managing.
