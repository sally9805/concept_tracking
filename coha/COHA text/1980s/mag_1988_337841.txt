It might be enough to persuade Mick Jagger , David Bowie and other celebrated tax exiles to come home to Britain . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's government took another step last week in its campaign to simplify British taxes and reduce the top rate . The latest budget calls for a sweeping tax reform similar to legislation passed in the U.S. in 1986 . Under Thatcher 's plan , six tax brackets , in which rates range from 27% to 60% , will be reduced to two : individuals with taxable incomes of ( pounds ) 19,300 ( about $35,500 ) a year or less will pay 25% , those who earn more , 40% . Though Thatcher has brought the top tax rate down from a peak of 83% in 1979 , not everyone is pleased . When Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presented the budget in the House of Commons last week , members of the opposition Labor Party interrupted him by chanting , " Rich man 's budget , " causing a ten-minute suspension of the session .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
