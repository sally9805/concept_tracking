 | Spying by the Soviet Union and its satellites is spreading rapidly throughout the United States ? but especially here in this city . The Communists have turned New York into the spy capital of the world . Alarmed by the surge in espionage activity , the Federal Bureau of Investigation has beefed up its counterintelligence staff in New York , which now is believed to number several hundred . Still , it can not keep up with the rising number of Communist agents . Atty . Gen. William French Smith warned in a speech on December 18 : " Over the last dozen years , the number of official representatives of governments with hostile intelligence activities in our country has increased by 400 percent . " FBI Director William H. Webster has joined in sounding a warning , reporting that 35 percent of so-called diplomats from unfriendly nations are actually professional spies . On an ABC News telecast January 3 , Webster said there has been " a rather extensive increase " recently in the number of " foreign intelligence-trained individuals here , mostly under diplomatic coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments in the United States , Webster 's 35 percent spy rate would mean a total of more than 1,000 diplomat spies ? each of whom could be supervising several agents . Why is New York such a magnet for spies ? For one thing , the city is headquarters of the United Nations , a gold mine of information where diplomats from all over the world are stationed . Hundreds of them are known to be full-time intelligence agents ; many others double as part-time spies . Another reason for New York 's popularity as a spy base is that many of Communism 's prime targets for espionage are located here or close by . Besides the U.N . itself , the city houses headquarters of some of America 's largest corporations and financial institutions . Their employes can ? and often do ? provide the Soviets with valuable information . High tech . Communist agents also are lured by the presence in the New York area of many aerospace and computer companies , producers of advanced technology that Moscow badly needs but can not make itself . The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Attorney General Smith said : " At one time , the FBI could match suspected hostile intelligence agents in the United States on a one-to-one basis . Now , the number of hostile agents has grown so much that our FBI counterintelligence agents are greatly outnumbered . " The edge held by hostile agents is especially clear in New York . The number of foreign diplomats and members of their families stationed here has increased by 13,000 in the last five years to a new total of 35,000 . Russians are not only the most active in spying here , but also the most numerous . More than 700 Russians work in the Soviet mission at the U.N. , in the U.N . secretariat or in Russia 's various civilian agencies such as the Amtorg Trading Company , the Aeroflot airline and Tass news agency . About 35 percent ? or more than 200 ? of those Russians are considered by Western intelligence agencies to be active spies . Copy fever ? There are 168 Soviet citizens on the U.N . secretariat staff alone . A European familiar with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A third of the Russian contingent there is actually doing U.N . work . The rest run around photocopying e S everything they can lay their hands on . " Besides the Russians , New York is home base for hundreds of spies representing Cuba , Vietnam and the Communist countries of Eastern Europe . They all cooperate and share secrets with the Soviet Union . As for China : Says FBI Agent Donald J. McGorty : " I have no doubt the Chinese are planting the seeds of a future espionage operation , maybe by cultivating young college kids , but that is 30 years down the road . The Chinese are a concern of ours , but not in the classical espionage sense . They are n't meeting in alleys and passing microfilm . " Soviet agents here operate under the direction of Vladimir Kazakov , 49 , local chief of the Kremlin 's secret police and intelligence agency , the KGB . Kazakov 's cover title is deputy permanent representative to the U.N . under Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky . Russia 's top spy in the U.S. , Dmitri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselor at the Soviet Embassy in Washington . He is reported planning to return to Moscow soon , after a six-year Washington assignment . The Russian spies in New York work from the Soviet U.N . mission in midtown Manhattan just across the street from the 19th Precinct police station ? and from a recently completed apartment house in the Riverdale section of the Bronx that houses Soviet personnel and their families . The roof of that apartment building bristles with antennas for sophisticated gear to eavesdrop on American telephone conversations . Similar equipment is found at the Soviet Embassy in  | Washington and the consulate in San Francisco . How do the diplomat spies operate ? According to the FBI , their main role is to recruit agents ? sometimes Americans ? who do most of the actual work . The diplomat directs their activities and relays findings to Moscow . Recruiting a spy is typically a threestage affair . First , the intelligence officer selects a likely candidate ? one with access to U.S. diplomatic , military or technological secrets . He arranges a social meeting and develops an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploit , usually a desire for money . Then , if the prospect proves willing , comes the developmental stage in which the recruit is given cameras and signal equipment and taught to use them . In the final stage , the recruit has no further direct contact with his controller . They communicate only via secret " dead drops " for messages , through intermediaries or , increasingly , in visits to foreign countries . In a drive to ward off such recruiting , the FBI is spending more and more time and manpower briefing likely spy targets in and out of government . The campaign has resulted in several reports of attempted contacts by Soviet agents . In addition to the full-time spies based in this country , the FBI also has to worry about the large numbers of business delegations , cultural tour groups , ships ' crews and tourists who visit the U.S. from Communist countries . " It is possible ? and probable ? that some of these people drop off in the U.S. and do n't go back , " says an FBI agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing number of Russian emigres , now arriving in New York by the hundreds every month . They concentrate in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn . Among these immigrants , it is believed , are some " sleeper " agents being planted here to meld into American life and later emerge as spies . " We know there are persons who got out of Russia only on their promise to cooperate when they get here , " notes R. Jean Gray , head of the local FBI section that keeps an eye on Russians . Officials refuse to estimate how many such sleepers are secretly at work in the U.S. , but sources indicate that many are known to the FBI and are kept under quiet surveillance . One reason U.N . diplomats are so valuable as spies is that those attached to the secretariat can travel freely in the United States . They are not covered by the travel restrictions imposed on Communist diplomats assigned to embassies and consulates . Even if caught , some diplomats can escape trial and imprisonment by invoking diplomatic immunity . About all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his native country . That 's what happened to Vladimir Zinyakin , a member of the Soviet mission to the U.N. , when he was caught trying to buy secrets of antisubmarine warfare in 1978 . Western intelligence officials say that the Russians prowl the halls of the U.N. , seeking contacts among diplomats from Third World countries . Those diplomats are usually among the rising stars in their countries , and the Soviets feel that a contact established in New York is likely to bear fruit later . " It is a school of fish they would like to hook , " says FBI Agent Gray . Communist spies go after many types of information ? military , diplomatic and scientific . But , according to FBI Director Webster , " The major thrust today in Soviet and Soviet-bloc countries is technology transfer . " How do spies get their hands on American know-how ? " Well , they are stealing it , " said Webster in his ABC News interview . Embargoes forbid the sale of most highly technological equipment to Russia , but Soviet agents find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal through other countries , or even through Western nationals , to buy an American item and then transship it to Russia through another country . Example : A Russianborn businessman , Anatoli Tony Maluta , was convicted in Los Angeles last October of exporting millions of dollars ' worth of restricted high-technology electronic gear that ostensibly was consigned to West Germany but wound up in Soviet-bloc countries . Plugging the dike . To cope with the growth of such rackets , the U.S. Customs Service has stepped up its investigations of technology exports . Occasionally , this vigilance pays off . Early in 1981 , for example , the Customs Service , acting on a tip , planted an electronic tracing " bug " in a device for receiving microwave transmissions that had been purchased by an American . The suspicion was that the American was planning to ship it abroad without an export license . Sure enough , the bug led agents to Kennedy International Airport , where a suitcase containing the unlicensed receiver had been checked aboard a flight to West Germany . The agents moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not expected to halt the illegal traffic in American technology . Says a customs official : " We expect that , as we become more sophisticated in detecting such ruses , they will also become more sophisticated in finding ways to get their contraband out of this county . " Occasional successes are reported in catching spies dealing in military secrets . In Los Angeles on December 15 , a Polish national named Marian W. Zacharski was sentenced to life in prison for buying secret defense documents from an American . The American , William Holden Bell ? a former aircraft-company engineer who admitted getting $95,000 for the information ? was sentenced to eight years in prison . Another American , Joseph George Helmich , Jr. , pleaded guilty last September to conspiring to sell military secrets to the Soviet Union . But even with such successes the outlook is forbidding as Communist spies in the United States keep multiplying . " What worries me , " says FBI Agent McGorty , " is that the other side totally and absolutely outnumbers us , 10 to 1 . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
