txt BANGOR , Me. ? Casey Bukro 's article opposing the proposed dams on Maine 's St. John River matches my sentiments , but my reasons are different . The Dickey-Lincoln dams would flood a great deal of prime forest land and produce power at inefficient cost . The loss of productive woodland is extremely important here because of the large flood plain involved  --  close to 80,000 acres lost to use . It 's not the " last truly productive woodland in the East , " but it is a resource that produces wood , badly needed in Maine and nationally . Out of the 500 million acres of commercial forest land in the U.S. , we have legislated and fragmented until we have only 250 million acres available for growing wood on a productive basis . That 's about one acre apiece for each man , woman , and child in the U.S. not a lot of forest to meet our wood needs . Arguments sounding rather like " the last wild river . .. the rare furbish lousewort " have been used to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences . While we fiddle with an inefficient public proposal , several efficient , private proposals that would produce power close to where it 's needed and use less land and water languish . The " last truly wild river in the East " jugument is being used to oppose projects on a variety of rivers in Maine . I 'm puzzled as to how they all can be the last wild river . And , little known varieties of fairly common flora and fauna , such as the furbish lousewort , are also commonly found as reasons to obstruct a variety of projects . If we 're going to support the numbers of people now living in the manner in which they 're accustomed , we 're going to need approval for productive use of all of our resources . The dams proposed for the St. John River do n't cut the mustard for a variety of reasons , but I 'm concerned that we are almost ritually repeating the objections that fit the dams onthe St. John whenever anyone proposes to touch any of our resources .
