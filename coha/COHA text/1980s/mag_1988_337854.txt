The performance , given by a wily veteran of guerrilla warfare , was a tactical masterpiece . Arriving in Washington last week , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir faced heavy pressure from the Reagan Administration to accept a U.S. proposal for peace between Israel and the Palestinians , a plan whose conditions he had publicly reviled at home . Engaging in a shrewd game of stalling and sliding , Shamir , who got his start as a leader in the Jewish underground in pre-1948 Palestine , managed to avoid an open confrontation with his U.S. allies : he neither formally rejected their proposal nor moved an inch closer to it . At the same time he managed to create the general impression that his differences with the U.S. were a mere ripple in an otherwise harmonious friendship . The Reagan Administration too seemed eager to put the best possible light on the meetings . " What I am happy to tell you , " said Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy to a congressional committee , " is that we do n't have a no from any party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That flimsy shred of optimism hardly disguises the fact that the Administration 's plan is foundering , and one of the principal reasons for this is Shamir 's obdurate opposition to key provisions of the initiative . While neither Israeli nor Arab leaders have officially rejected the proposal , positions on both sides have hardened as the 3 1/2-month-old struggle between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces has escalated in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . The plan , as set forth by Secretary of State George Shultz , calls for an international conference on the Middle East , to be held this spring and attended by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , Israel and its Arab neighbors . The proposal provides for some degree of self-rule in the occupied territories and sets December 1988 as a deadline for the start of negotiations aimed at reaching a final settlement in which Israel would return occupied lands in exchange for a promise of peace . <P> In three days of discussions with Shultz and President Reagan , Shamir focused his objections on the international conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its adversaries . Shamir repeated his past offer to negotiate directly with Jordan 's King Hussein under U.S.-Soviet auspices . By dwelling on the format for negotiations , Shamir deftly diverted the discussion from his far more fundamental objection to the plan : the " land- for-peace " formula that has been at the heart of U.S. peace initiatives since Israel occupied the Arab territories in 1967 . <P> The Reagan Administration insists that its proposal is an indivisible package , carefully balanced to meet competing demands from many sides . " This is not a delicatessen , where you can pick and choose , " said a Reagan adviser . While the Administration took pains to maintain a friendly atmosphere  --  Shultz even invited Shamir to his home for a breakfast of blueberry pancakes cooked by the Secretary 's wife Helena  --  strain was evident in President Reagan 's statement during the official departure ceremony at the White House . Those who rejected the plan , warned Reagan , would not have to answer to the U.S. , but " they 'll need to answer to themselves and their people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to achieve negotiations .
