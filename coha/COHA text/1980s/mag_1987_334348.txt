Bring out the sandbags ! The American music industry is already at war with a new audio technology that is expected to land in U.S. stores sometime this year . The enemy is the digital audio tape , yet another advance in high-quality sound reproduction that will be marketed by Japanese electronics firms . DAT 's imminent arrival on U.S. shores has stirred a protectionist outcry from an entire industry , all the way from record-company headquarters in Manhattan to sound studios in Los Angeles . <P> The new technology takes consumer electronics one step beyond the compact disc . Like CDs , DAT is a product of the digital recording techniques that use computers to sort sound into billions of bits of information before they are put on magnetic tape . While current models of CD players can only play music , however , digital tape machines can also record live music and copy other recorded music . <P> The cost of both the DAT cassettes and the machines needed to play them is high enough so that the new technology will probably appeal , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ordinary analog cassettes but about two-thirds the size , DATs are expected to cost about $12 . At first , digital tape machines will set buyers back anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 , vs. $200 to $600 for CD players . <P> What really alarms the music industry about the digital tape is its quality . Free of tape hiss and static crackling common to ordinary tape and record players , the DAT 's sound is so fine that it is bound to encourage home taping of prerecorded music . To prevent unauthorized duplication , record companies and industry organizations have joined ranks to demand that manufacturers of digital players equip them with special computer chips that block the copying of prerecorded music . The Reagan Administration is expected this week to introduce legislation to require such protection . <P> But if experience is any guide , the music industry will be hard pressed to prevent consumers from enthusiastically embracing the new technology . Says Sony Spokesman David Kawakami : " Every day we get hundreds of calls asking when DATs will be in the stores . " Congress may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law that restricts home digital recording .
