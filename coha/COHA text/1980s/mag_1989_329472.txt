A new sign in stately Old English letters has been hung up on the worn red brick building , the leaky roof has been repaired , and the staff has thumbed gingerly through crumbling back issues , gathering fragments of history to print again . The Adair County Free Press of Greenfield , Iowa , is just about ready for its 100th birthday next week . Same newspaper , same family of editors , no sellout to a chain , no fortunes made or lost , circulation steady at 3,200 in a county of 9,500 and a town of 2,200 . The back issues form a tapestry of small events , a century of stories of children 's birthdays , club meetings , 4-H calves , men and women going off to war and , always , the terrors and joys of the Great Prairie weather . Good people , good earth , both granted dignity and meaning on the pages of a tiny paper . <P> Editor and publisher Ed Sidey , my brother , will drape a wisp of bunting over the new sign , print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with coffee and cookies and a lot of laughter . Then he and his crew of nine will begin the work of the second century . <P> " Will the paper be around another 100 years ? " he wonders . " Will the town be recognizable in 2089 ? " He thinks so , but he is troubled . So are all the people who still make up a rural culture of farms and small towns from the Appalachians to the Rockies , for all of our history a taproot that nourished the other branches . The crisis of the farms themselves has passed for now , but around Greenfield 's town square the economic strain has worsened . A hardware store , a drugstore , a grocery store , a Ford dealership have all closed within three years . County residents are lured to the shopping centers of Des Moines , 60 miles east over smooth highways they helped build . <P> A Wal-Mart is going up in Creston , 20 miles away , and Greenfield 's merchants fear the worst . Wall Street traders will hail America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailing march across the country . But Walton 's new store , dropped in a field of asphalt ( one of 1,400 in his discount empire ) will suck a bit more of the commercial life out of Greenfield and similar towns in the same radius . Another comfortable old building with arched windows and high ceilings may have to be padlocked . Not so long ago they were all open , and the square filled up on Saturday night , when neighbors came to buy and gossip . Prices were less important then than people . A caring society thrived there and helped to sustain the values that politicians now like to talk about as they see order and meaning melt away in urban complexes . <P> The rural culture was never as kindly and not always as pleasant as legend would have it . But necessity forced a concern for family and community and an interdependence that as often as not subdued meanness and selfishness . A certain virtue and hope were required for survival . <P> " A human community , if it is to last long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and local memory in place , " Kentucky farmer- philosopher Wendell Berry told Iowans last year in a lecture on the work of local culture . " Country people more and more live like city people , and so connive in their own ruin . More and more country people , like city people , allow their economic and social standards to be set by television and salesmen and outside experts . "
