The 10-to-8 vote was quickly followed by two votes in which the committee refused to send the nomination to the Senate floor with either no recommendation or an unfavorable one. // This appeared to kill the nomination , although in theory the full Senate could still bring it to the floor by a parliamentary device rarely used in such circumstances . <> <> Two Republicans Vote No // On the initial tally , two Republicans and all eight Democratic members of the committee voted against Mr. Reynolds , who has been chief of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department since 1981. // A Republican motion to send the nomination to the full Senate with no recommendation then failed , 9 to 9 . The session became tumultuous when Senator Paul Laxalt , Republican of Nevada , moved unexpectedly to send the nomination to the floor with an unfavorable recommendation , prompting Democrats to walk out . When order was restored , that motion also failed , 9 to 9. // Senators Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican , and Charles McC . Mathias Jr . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Specter joined other Republicans on the other two motions , but Mr. Mathias did not. // A Justice Department spokesman , John V. Wilson , said Mr. Reynolds would continue serving as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights . " He is definitely not going to resign in the foreseeable future , " Mr. Wilson said. // President Reagan made an intense effort to rescue the nomination , defending Mr. Reynolds in a radio address June 15 and calling many Senators to solicit support. // In a statement today , Mr. Reagan said : " I am deeply disappointed by the action of the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning . That some members of the committee chose to use the confirmation process to conduct an ideological assault on so superbly qualified a candidate was unjust and deeply wrong. // " Let me emphasize that Mr. Reynolds ' civil rights views reflect my own . The policies he pursued are the policies of this Administration , and they will remain our policies as long as I am President . Mr. Reynolds retains my full faith and confidence. " // Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration ' s policies had been " effective in combating unlawful discrimination of every sort . " <> <> ' Deceptive ' Answers Cited // Senators who voted against Mr. Reynolds said that he had been less than candid with the committee and that he seemed to have placed himself above the law by refusing to accept court interpretations of civil rights statutes. // Senator Howell Heflin , Democrat of Alabama , the only member who had not previously announced a position , voted against Mr. Reynolds , saying his " answers to numerous questions were deceptive and lacking in forthrightness , evasive and misleading. " // Mr. Specter said the votes were a judgment not just on Mr. Reynolds ' s qualifications but also on the civil rights policies of the Reagan Administration . Mr. Specter said Mr. Reynolds had taken positions " directly at variance with established law " and contrary to court precedents on such issues as voting rights , job discrimination and school desegregation. // Senator Mathias said , " It is now clear that Mr. Reynolds does not support the approach that Congress , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assuring civil rights. " // Mr. Reynolds has opposed any type of preferential treatment for women or minority groups , arguing that the Constitution was " color blind " and that hiring quotas were " morally wrong. " // It is rare for the Senate or its committees to reject a nominee , because of a strong presumption that the President is entitled to appoint people with views compatible with his own. // The full Senate could bring the Reynolds nomination to the floor by discharging the Judiciary Committee from further consideration of it . But there is little precedent for such a maneuver , and opponents could filibuster against both the motion to discharge the committee and the nomination itself. // Larry Speakes , the White House spokesman , said the Administration had not decided whether to push for use of the procedure to win confirmation . <> <> Civil Rights Groups Exultant // Civil rights groups were exultant over the votes . Julius LeVonne Chambers , director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. , claimed " a victory for all of us working hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades against his vicious attacks. " // But Senator Alan K. Simpson , Republican of Wyoming , a committee member , said Mr. Reynolds had been a victim of " bug-eyed zealots " who pored over transcripts of his testimony for inconsistencies . " They don ' t have the guts to say , ' This guy is a dud because he doesn ' t agree with us , ' so they put him through this ritual of being pecked to death by ducks , " said Mr. Simpson. // Mr. Reynolds has said he was attacked because he " dared to question " the orthodoxy of the " civil rights establishment , " which he described as a " pro-busing , pro-quota lobby . " But most of the Senators who voted against him said busing and quotas had not been important factors . Rather , they agreed with Senator Dennis DeConcini , Democrat of Arizona , who said Mr. Reynolds had a habit of " bending and altering the truth " and failed to enforce the laws he disliked . <> <> Apologies to Committee // Last week Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that he had no intent to deceive but that his recollection " may have failed " him in discussing several voting rights cases , out of the thousands he supervised. // When Senator Laxalt moved to report the nomination unfavorably , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware , the ranking Democrat , got up to leave , and other Democrats followed. // Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina , the committee chairman , ordered a roll-call vote. // Howard M. Metzenbaum , Democrat of Ohio , complained that Mr. Thurmond was trying to " railroad " the nomination in a violation of senatorial courtesy . After a five-minute recess , the Democrats returned , Mr. Thurmond and Mr. Biden apologized , and the committee finally voted on the Laxalt motion. // Senator Specter predicted that the confirmation hearings would have " an enormously beneficial impact on enforcement of the civil rights laws , " leading Mr. Reynolds to modify or " back off " from some of his positions. //                  @ @ @
