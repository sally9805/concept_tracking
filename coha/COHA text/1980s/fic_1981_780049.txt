 | " Can be cleared and taken any time now . Ca n't make plans . I 'll go home and wait around . Damn unpleasant business . " " I think they 're calling us , Arthur . " They had lined up in alphabetical order . Gershon followed Arthur out of the room . The procession formed up on the cement rim of the quadrangle behind the waiting audience . The academic hoods splashed patches of vivid color onto the sober air of the wide , redbrick enclosure . A hush fell upon the quadrangle . Overhead an airliner flew by , vibrating the still air . The procession comprised the faculty , the top administrators , the chairman of the Board of Overseers , guests of honor , and the graduating seminarians . In front , flanking the chancellor , were Albert Einstein and Harry Truman , both impressive in their robes and caps . Truman wore no hood ; Einstein 's hood had the yellow color of a doctor of science . Malkuson and Keter followed : dark caps and gowns , golden tassels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood  --  Gershon was startled  --  Rabbi Isaac Levin , Karen 's father , tall , silver-haired , in dark cap and gown , gold-colored tassel , and white and blue hood . Gershon saw him say something to Keter and Malkuson , watched them bend toward him to catch his words , and then saw them laugh . How strange to see the normally expressionless face of Jakob Keter break into a laugh ! Behind the faculty were guests of honor  --  faces familiar from newspaper and magazine accounts of the controversy among scientists that preceded and followed the explosion of the American hydrogen bomb two years before . He thought he recognized Enrico Fermi , Edward Teller , Leo Szilard . There was Arthur 's father  --  gaunt and , yes , tanned  --  talking earnestly with Enrico Fermi . All five wore dark robes with the three velvet bars on the sleeves , dark caps with goldcolored tassels , and yellow hoods . Gershon had a swift momentary vision of the world aflame , rivers boiling , mountains melting . The audience rose . A chorus of seminarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered the quadrangle . Gershon felt the grass beneath his shoes and the sun in his eyes . He bumped heavily into Arthur , who had stopped for a moment . " Sorry , " he murmured . Arthur said nothing . The line moved on . Somewhere in the audience were his aunt and uncle , Karen , and Arthur 's family .  | He felt eyes upon him and looked down . They were approaching the empty front chairs , stepping between the rows , finding their seats . The chairs on the stage were filling with gowned men ? Einstein , Truman , Leiden , the chancellor , Karen 's father , Keter , Malkuson . The singing ceased . There was silence . A bird chirped in the silence , and there was the clearly audible cooing of the pigeons on the ledge below Malkuson 's study . The chorus led the singing of the national anthem . Then all were seated . Gershon glanced quickly through the program that had been placed on his chair . Karen 's father was the presiding officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program . Arthur leaned toward him , reading the question in his eyes . He whispered , " Some very ill , were n't sure they would make it . Also , security problems . Too much of our atomic future in one open place . You know what I mean ? " Gershon nodded , looking at him . He seemed so weary , his handsome face pale , his eyes dark . He remembered him entering their room in the early morning , drink on his breath . He heard his banter , his laments about Malkuson and Keter killing him , his gaiety . He had not been much of a friend to Arthur . But Arthur had not really wanted friendship . Instead , he had wanted  --  needed , it seemed  --  some measure of companionship , to be available on request ; and that , Gershon felt , he had given him . He might have given more if he had felt himself being called upon  --  despite his dark memories of past abandonments , of the world withdrawing itself from him : parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the seminary with him , and then had gone elsewhere . Now Arthur sat next to him looking tired and sad ; and soon they would separate . Perhaps it was better this way , better . Too many abandonments . Too much remembered pain and the feeling of the breaking apart of things . . . . He sat lost in thought , and only a part of him attended  --  dimlyto the pageant on the stage : the introductory remarks of the presiding officer , Karen 's father  --  clear , loud , amplified voice  --  about the nature of this gathering on the soil of this free land , whose future  | is in the hands of those who not only toil with their hands upon visible reality but also bend to higher purpose the unseen worlds of spiritual and physical reality . " Never was there a greater need than now for a vision of our future , " Gershon heard him say , his voice somewhat oracular , his pronunciation tinged with New England accents . " We have it in our hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit . " He felt Arthur stir beside him . Karen 's father went on a moment longer ; Gershon was no longer listening . The sun glowed warmly upon the quadrangle , lighting some windows . He heard applause . The chancellor rose and went to the podium . Professor Malkuson approached him and asked to present the distinguished former President of the United States , Harry S. Truman , for the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa . Truman rose . A citation was read by the chancellor . Malkuson and Keter accompanied Truman to the podium and placed on his shoulders a hood with purple velvet on the outside and blue on the inside . There was much applause . The applause died away . Everyone sat silent . Truman stood alone at the podium , smiling , looking around . The tassel accompanied with slight swaying dances the movement of his head ; his glasses glinted and flashed , as had the windows on the tall buildings along Riverside Drive the day Gershon had taken his comprehensive with Keter . Why did that seem so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . What was he saying , in that same twangy slightly nasal voice that had once announced the end of the European war , the destruction of Hiroshima by an atomic bomb , the end of the war with Japan , the tactics in the dread Cold War with Russia , America 's recognition of the State of Israel , our entry into the Korean War , the thermonuclear experiments on a Pacific atoll ? He seemed so much a man like other men . How influence and power had once issued forth from him ! He was talking about the Bible , about how much he liked to read the twentieth chapter of Exodus and the fifth chapter of Deuteronomy . " The fundamental basis of government started with Moses on the Mount . He taught the God-given law , and he influenced the whole world . Moses is dead about three thousand years , and he still influences the world . That 's moral power , and I think it 's more lasting than political power . That 's what you young men are going out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the moral vision of Isaiah . " My mother had a great big goldback Bible . . . . " Gershon watched a fly sail lazily through the sunlight . Insects hopped about in the small green world of grass near his feet . What had this man really felt after they had exploded the test bomb at Alamogordo ? He had held the power of the sun in his hands . And after Hiroshima ? Gershon had a piercing vision of where he had been when the news had come over the radio . In his small sunless room . In the decaying red-brick apartment house with the odorous halls and peeling walls and the drunks and whores and the man who chased his wife down the stairs with a butcher knife and the black-metal fire escape like a zigzag scar down the face of the building . Yes , he remembered . An August evening in 1945 . He had climbed to the roof of the apartment house that night and gazed out at the stars and witnessed the whelping of the pups . Strange how they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand across the sky and felt , felt , the touch of the stars . But the bitch and her pups had disappeared . How easily broken was this brittle world . You did not need bombs to break it It seared able to break of itself . And this man had ended a savage war by incinerating two cities with two bombs . The soul doubled back on itself in a murderous clash of conflicting moralities . " I think the United States is the greatest government in the history of the world . Our continued existence is absolutely essential to the welfare and benefit of all people who would be free . " Who could have taken them from the roof ? How cool the air had been , how blue and cool the stars . No fires . Death was a distant dream . " And I think the men who wrote the Constitution wanted a document that would be a lasting instrument of government . But they did n't have any more idea of what the future would bring forth than we have today . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how the law of God would work out . So far they both have worked out , maybe because they both have benefited from respectful and constructive interpretation and revision . " A distant automobile horn blared ; someone in the audience coughed . The air was warm , very still . What had someone called the flash of the exploding bomb at Alamogordo ? He now remembered the stories . What ? Yes . Death light . A university student blind fifteen years had seen it through her blindness . Yes . He remembered . Death  | light . " And I thank you for this great honor and this most memorable day . " He felt himself rising , joining in the applause . He looked around but could see neither his aunt and uncle nor Karen . Perhaps his aunt and uncle were not standing ; the long subway trip had been difficult for them . He glanced to his left . Arthur stood very still , his hands at his sides , his face rigid . He saw Gershon looking at him and looked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the eyes of his former roommate rage and pain and a frightening darkness . The applause subsided . All took their seats . Karen 's father stood at the podium . An aircraft rumbled overhead . " I have the honor to present the graduating class .... " One by one , as their names were read off , each rose , went up to the podium , received his degree of ordination from the chancellor , shook his hand , and returned to his seat . Gershon glanced at the awards section of the program and saw his name followed by the words " The Richard Leiden Memorial Post-Graduate Fellowship Award . " He was first on a list of ten awards . He heard Arthur 's name called , saw him rise , make his way between the rows , and go up the stairs to the stage . Arthur shook the hand of the chancellor . He hesitated . His father half rose from his chair . Arthur came over to him . They shook hands . Gershon saw Truman bend sideways in his chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Albert Einstein , Karen 's father , Keter , Malkuson , and the chairman of the Board of Overseers . He was coming down off the stage and returning to his seat . " Gershon Loran . " He felt himself rising and moving . He sensed clearly the hushed silence , the grass beneath his feet , the cooing of the pigeons , and eyes , eyes , upon him . He looked at the grass and at the movement of his legs as they thrust forward beneath the gown . The cap was tight , tight ; the tassel swayed . Carefully , up the stairs . Carefully . The stage . He raised his eyes . An ocean of faces glowing in the sunlight : his classmates , the faculty and guests , the audience , the men on the stage . Truman , Einstein , Keter , Malkuson . . . . There was the face of Enrico Fermi . First atomic chain reaction . Chicago . There , Leo Szilard . Drafted the letter signed by Einstein and sent on to Roosevelt . Sir : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . leads me to  | expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future . . . . This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs . . . . He had read all that in a science book . Long letter . Did presidents read such long letters ? All the faces and eyes in the sunlight . Waiting . Golden globes of light . Where was Karen ? He was shaking the chancellor 's hand . Out of the corner of an eye he saw Arthur 's father motion to him . He felt himself moving again . His hand was gripped by Arthur 's father , and he found himself staring into gray sad eyes set in circles of dark and bluish skin . The nose was straight , the mouth delicate , sensitive , curiously curved into a smile that seemed a mixture of poignant sorrow and weary determination . Next to Arthur 's father sat Albert Einstein . " Congratulations , " Einstein said to him , shaking his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman , Keter , Malkuson , Karen 's father . . . . He was on the grass , moving . His heart raced wildly . He felt a tightness in his throat and chest and took some deep breaths . He was sliding into his seat , shaking Arthur 's hand , other hands . " He 's not well , " he heard Arthur murmur . " Not well at all . " " Your father ? " " Einstein . " " Is your mother here ? " " Of course . She 's the one not smiling . I saw Karen . She looks great . " " Why are all these scientists here , Arthur ? " " They 're friends of the family . To be accurate , all were once friends . Today some are enemies . Joined together by our common humanity , so to speak . God , I wish they 'd hurry this up . " The names of the graduates continued to be called . Arthur sat fidgeting on the wooden chair . Gershon , sweating , his heart still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling and no thought ; a static sense of floating in a pool of opalescent air . He heard deep within himself the words of a Merkavah celestial hymn : " A quality of holiness , a quality of power . . . . " Who was that rising now ? Karen 's father ? " . . . not on program for reasons we feel are best left unstated . My honor and privilege to introduce one of the immortals of our time .... "  | As if suddenly jolted from the grassy earth , all the audience rose simultaneously . A heavy and respectful thunder of applause reverberated through the warm and sunny air of the quadrangle . Albert Einstein stood at the podium : dark cap and gown , golden tassel , yellow hood . The wide bristly mustache , the shock of thick white hair , the dark hooded eyes , the deep lines etched into the forehead and running from the outside corners of the eyes across the hills and hollows of the cheeks . All were applauding and gazing in awe upon this man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed , weary . The applause subsided . The audience was seated . A deep resonant hush fell upon the quadrangle . Gershon saw Arthur staring straight ahead at the podium , his mouth partly open , his eyes wide , somewhat glazed . " A quality of holiness , a quality of power . " Gershon felt the rise of the words within him . " A quality of fearfulness , a quality of sublimity .... " Through the silence came the muted sounds of the Sunday afternoon traffic along the Drive . A warm breeze stirred the air of the quadrangle . Einstein stood at the podium . The yellow of the hood caught the sun , and Gershon felt a flash of light upon his eyes . Einstein spoke in a barely audible voice and with the heavy accents of his native Germany . This was a day of ironies and healings , he said . A day when many opposites have come together . A day when many things broken are being repaired  --  if not permanently then at least temporarily . " All my life I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's history . War . It comes from absolute ignorance , absolute greed , absolute cruelty . I fled from Nazi Germany because the Nazis were all these absolutes joined together . My brilliant and shining and civilized Germany turned and went in the opposite direction , toward darkness and barbarism . I will not return . Some paths a man takes can not be retraced . Some acts can not be undone . " The high thin voice , feeble , drifted with curious strength through the luminous silence of the quadrangle . Gershon felt a coldness on the back of his neck . All on the stage were listening intently . " There are times , I must tell you , when I regret a certain act of mine . I made perhaps one great mistake in my life  --  when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be  | made . There was some justification to that act  --  the danger that the Germans would make them . They did not succeed . We succeeded and dropped them on Japan . It ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that can not be undone . It is damage human beings have done to themselves that can not be repaired . Do you wish to know what a dear friend of mine , a man I have known for decades , said to me before he returned to live in Germany after the war ? He said to me , Einstein , the Americans have demonstrated in Dresden , Hiroshima , and Nagasaki that in sheer speed of extermination they surpass even the Nazis . ' The comparison is , of course , wrong . But the stain of the act remains . Perhaps it was a choice between evils . Perhaps that is the nature of all serious acts of choosing . Nevertheless , I feel we are all stained . " The faces of the men on the stage were impassive . Truman sat unmoving , staring at the back of Einstein , the black robe , the black cap , the yellow hood . Gershon heard Arthur take a deep , trembling breath . Tiny winged insects whirred through the still air . Einstein continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Nazis referred to theoretical physics as Jewish physics . ' We should perhaps be grateful that Hitler so hated the Jews that he stripped his Germany of its best physicists and was himself uninterested in the possibility of nuclear fission . Speaking for myself , I wanted only to understand better my universe , not to help make bombs . My colleagues and I  --  not all of them Jews  --  gave the gift of atomic power to a benevolent land , to America . How this gift will be used is in the hands of the makers of policy . I try to be of influence . But this is now the voice of an old man who loves his chair and his sweater and his books more than he does the tumult of the world . " He stopped and passed a hand before his eyes and was silent . He gazed down at the top of the podium and seemed for a moment to have slid in thought away from the quadrangle and the stage and the sunlight and the simple pious reality of a seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . Einstein looked up and blinked his eyes . Yes . He had been away somewhere . Gershon felt again the coldness on the back of his neck . Einstein continued . " If we have indeed erred by giving this gift to  | the world , we in part rectify this error by our act today . All of us here , Jew and gentile , join together in homage to a family 's vision . Embedded in the tradition of the Jewish people there is a love of justice and reason . The Leiden family displays such a love . In doing so , it helps to balance our past poor choices , the evils we do and that are done to us ; it helps relieve life of something of its earthbound heaviness . The Leiden and Einstein families have been friends for decades . This goes back to the days of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute , where a young American once came to study physics . I will not burden you with the memories of an old man . This good family lost a dear son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after many years of sorrow to convert the ashes of its grief into a light of hope . To study , to teach  --  that is the hope . It is a way to help overcome ignorance , greed , and cruelty . The Leiden family has given the name of the fallen son to an endowed graduate fellowship which has been awarded for the first time to Mr. ? to Rabbi Gershon Loran of this graduating class . Loran . That is , I believe , also the name of a navigational instrument , is it not ? You see ? I am not so much a lover of a life of quiet contemplation as to be unaware entirely of the outside world . " There was a stir and a wave of soft laughter . Gershon sat with the blood surging in his ears . He saw Arthur smiling faintly . " By such an act the Leiden family shows that it remains faithful to the moral traditions which have enabled the Jewish people to survive for thousands of years despite the heavy storms that have broken over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and participate in this act of healing , this act of placing a garment of grace upon past stains . " He turned away from the podium and , in the applause that rose through the quadrangle , moved slowly back to his seat . Gershon felt classmates thumping his back . Arthur applauded but said nothing . All were standing and applauding . Truman was applauding . Einstein stood with his head bowed . An airliner flew by overhead . The sun had dipped behind the library building . The names of the other award winners were announced . The chancellor spoke briefly . The choir burst again into song . Gershon found himself moving in a line with his classmates . He came from the grass to the concrete rim , then went through a door . All around  | was the din of disintegrating order , happy voices . He was in a room with his classmates . Arthur was nowhere to be seen . Congratulations , Gershon . Congratulations . Handshakes . Back thumps . Hey , Gershon , does Einstein know you 're a kabbalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein giving an award to a kabbalist . The whole world is nuts ! No , I do n't know where Arthur is . Wearing his cap and gown , Gershon went down a corridor and into a men 's room . He saw Arthur bent over a sink washing his face . Water dripped from his chin onto the gown . " Are you all right , Arthur ? " " Where are the towels ? What happened to the towels ? Never mind . I 'll use my handkerchief . Too much emotion out there . Too damn many memories . Interferes with my thinks , as Uncle Albert would put it . " " I did n't know the award was in memory of your brother . The dean said it was your grandfather . " " The dean was mistaken . Can I borrow your handkerchief ? Never mind . I 'll manage . What a day ! Uncle Albert went on a bit long . I thought I would burst . What 's the matter , Gershon ? " " How didthea-war-d get to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I mean I do n't really think I deserve it . How did it get to me ? " " You deserve it . " " No , I do n't , Arthur . Listen . I sat in classes here four years and was n't sure from one minute to the next if I was right or wrong about most of the things I was listening to . I wrote papers , took exams , took notes , answered questions  --  and I was never sure . I 'm not that good , Arthur . I do n't like getting an award in your brother 's name that I really do n't deserve . " " Gershon , you really do ? " " How did it get to me , Arthur ? " The door was pushed open , and two of their classmates came in . Hello ! Hello ! How nice to meet you here , rabbis . Hello ! Gershon followed Arthur out into the hallway . Loud laughter echoed from a distant corridor . The hallway was deserted . " Why are you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's wrong . I do n't deserve it . You wo n't get me to take his place . "  | " What are you talking about ? My parents wanted to set up a scholarship in my brother 's memory . They wanted it for Harvard . I told Karen about it , and she told her father . He went to work on my parents and got them to change their minds and give it to the seminary . I suggested to my parents to make it conditional upon your acceptance of it , provided you were deserving of it anyway . From there it went to the chancellor and to Keter and Malkuson and to you . That 's all . You deserve it , you crazy kabbalist . All I did was push you into making up your mind . " " I could n't have deserved it , " Gershon said in a low small tremulous voice . " I do n't feel ? " " Listen , I 've got my family waiting for me out there . " A group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Congratulations ! Great speech by Einstein . Great ! Good luck ! " Come on , " Arthur said . " Do n't you have an aunt and uncle out there somewhere ? Do n't you have a girl friend ? Listen , if I do n't see you again today  --  take care of yourself . Sorry for all the trouble I may have caused you . Late nights and things . Sorry . Take good care of yourself , Gershon . " They were outside in the joyous confusion on the quadrangle . He searched and found his aunt and uncle near the flower bed , looking distraught . They embraced him with murmurs of awe . Albert Einstein ! This was the camp of the enemy , this non-fundamentalist citadel of renegade Judaism  --  and yet here their nephew , sole hope and remnant of the family , had been honored . They seemed bewildered and unable to focus a coherent reaction upon the day . " Proud , proud , " his aunt said . " Blessings on your head . " " Einstein , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he mean ? What ? " Gershon could barely hear them above the noise . People moved by in a stream , offering their good wishes . Someone thrust a cup of coffee into his hands . You will come up with me for a coffee ? Yes ? I will tell you something . . . . A little gossip . To be told only in a whisper . " We will go home now ? " asked his aunt . " Your uncle is very tired . His lungs . . . . " There was Karen , so beautiful in a lacy summer dress . Her mother , younger sisters , brother . She embraced him , almost knocking the coffee from his hands . Proud , so proud .  | Awed sibling stares ; warm handshake and cheek kiss from her mother . Karen 's face wore a high flush of excitement . " Will I see you later ? " " I have to take my aunt and uncle home . " " Call me , please . " " Sure . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so proud . " She took the cup away . " Hello , Karen , " Arthur said from somewhere behind him , and before he turned he saw the flush deepen to crimson on her face . Arthur stood there in his cap and gown , tall , strands of blond hair pasted to his moist forehead . There seemed a sadness to his eyes . He was flanked by his parents , his mother elegantly dressed in a darkblue dress and long white gloves , his father still garbed in cap and gown . " Our congratulations , " his father said to Gershon . " Yes , " his mother said . " Thank you , " Gershon said . " How are you , Karen ? " Arthur 's mother asked . " Thank you , fine , " said Karen . " Mrs. Levin ? " " Well , thank you . " " You must come and see us if you 're ever in Boston , Rabbi Loran , " she said , turning to Gershon . Her face was smooth and pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur looked down as she spoke . " We would be delighted to have you stay with us . Our home is kosher . Arthur saw to that . " " Thank you , " Gershon heard himself say . " What you be studying ? " Arthur 's father said . " Kabbala " " Yes , " he said after a moment . " That 's right . With Jakob Keter . That was mentioned to me . Why did I forget it ? " " I think we ought to start thinking of leaving , Charles , " Arthur 's mother said . " There may be traffic on the way to the airport . Come , Arthur . Goodbye , Karen . Mrs. Levin . Do think of visiting , Rabbi Loran . I would like to get to know the individual who has received the first fellowship in my son 's name . Goodbye . " Arthur shook Gershon 's hand . " She means it , " he said in a low voice . " Take care of yourself . Maybe yon can utter an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years go by smoothly . A little  | practical Kabbalah , a little white magic . What good is all that study if it ca n't be put to some use ? Goodbye , dear Gershon . Take care of yourself . " He followed his parents into the crowd . Gershon said to Karen a moment later , " I lived with him for two years , and I still do n't understand him . " Karen started to reply and stopped . " I 'll call you later , " he said . " Gershon , " his aunt said . " Your uncle is very tired . " " I have to get out of this cap and gown . " " I love you in that cap and gown , " Karen whispered , leaning toward him . " How well did you know Arthur ? " he asked . She said , after a moment , " Very well . " " I 'll call you as soon as I get home , " he said , and went off toward the dormitory building . Near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malkuson , and the chancellor , deep in conversation . Keter saw him . " Mr. Loran . Rabbi Loran . My congratulations . " He shook their hands . " Loran forsakes the Torah for the Kabbalah , " said Professor Malkuson . " You have won the wager , Keter . " The chancellor looked on , smiling , paternal . " We will wait a little longer before declaring the winner , " Keter said . " In the meantime I wish you a pleasant summer , Rabbi Loran . Study your languages . I leave tomorrow for Jerusalem and will return in October . " Gershon left his cap and gown in the room where he had earlier donned them , and put on his jacket . Was it all over already ? So quickly ? In the corridor he met the dean of students , who was still in cap and gown , and perspiring . " Congratulations . " " You did n't tell me the award was named after Arthur 's brother . " " Who knew ? I thought it was the grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I 'm going to be able to get you a dorm room for next year . The bosses on high say rooms are for seminarians only . I 'll keep trying . Congratulations , rabbi . "  | He came back out to the quadrangle . Long shadows lay upon the grass and the disheveled rows of chairs . The crowd was thinning . His aunt and uncle stood near the flowers . Karen was with them . " They look a little forlorn , " she said . " I did n't want to leave them alone . " " When are you going up to the Berkshires ? " " The end of next week . Here 's my father . " " Quite a day . Marvelous day . A coup for the seminary . Proud of you , my boy . Keep working hard . The world will hear great things from you one day . " He shook Gershon 's hand . He shook the hands of his aunt and uncle . " Splendid day . Splendid . Goodbye , my boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his aunt and uncle out of the gate and down the steps to the street . He walked with them along the Drive , past tall apartment houses . It was early evening . The sun hung low over the river and the hills , a dull , red burning disc into which he could gaze without difficulty . Make us a miracle , Gershon . A little practical Kabbalah , a little white magic . He walked slowly between his aunt and uncle , holding their arms . They took the subway home . He-lived at home all the next year , in his sunless room , with its narrow bed and bureau and small desk and shelves of books . There were many fires in the decaying neighborhood . Empty buildings burst into flames in the cold hours of the night . He woke often to the sounds of fire engines and lay in the darkness listening to the sirens move through the streets . One morning he walked by a house that had burned the night before : charred windows , blackened and gutted interior , debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickened the air . People sauntered by in silence , faces vacant . No one seemed to know who was burning the dead buildings of the neighborhood . Karen had urged him to rent a room near Columbia . He would have been happy with a dormitory room in the seminary . But a rented room of his own away from his aunt and uncle seemed somehovran act of abandonment , He did not know why he felt that way ;  | but he knew that he did and so lived at home and woke to the fire engines and walked past the skeletons of cremated buildings . Three times a week he took the subway to Manhattan . He studied languages at Columbia and Kabbalah with Jakob Keter in his Riverside Drive apartment . On the subway he read and dozed , resigned to the dirt and the screams of tortured metal and the dim lights and the lurching cars . The subway train was his throne-chariot , he once said to Karen after a ride in which he had sat in the darkness of a suddenly dead train for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sapphire ; conductors in human form .

What can I do ? I 'll go on traveling in my chariot . No , I do n't hear anything . Are your parents due back so soon ? It 's only a quarter to one . " He experienced a curious turn in his reading . In addition to his languages and Kabbalah texts he began to read works having to do with the atom , atomic power , atomic bombs . He read newspaper and magazine articles on Los Alamos . He read the Smyth Report on the making of the first bomb . He read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oppenheimer , Edward Teller . The name Charles Leiden appeared often in his reading ; something about the implosion principle and the concept of fusion . One November afternoon Gershon ran into the dean of students near the entrance to the subway outside the Columbia campus . Arthur Leiden ? Fine , as far as he knew . Teaching in a Hebrew high school near Boston . No , his clearance had n't come through yet . Any day now . No , a part-time teaching job . " You look pale , Gershon . How 's your year ? Do n't work so hard . Do n't take everything so seriously . When are you due for your army physical ? Good luck . Good luck . " Karen completed her dissertation in December and submitted it to her adviser . She spent three weeks working on the list of suggested revisions and submitted it again . It was accepted . Her dissertation  | defense was scheduled for the last week in February , a few days before Gershon 's army physical . She went about in a torment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gershon .

Come here to me . We do n't need incantations . We 're twentieth-century people . Come here , you sadeyed kabbalist .

Gershon came over after his evening seminar with Keter and held her and listened to her cry . She was trembling and crying . Her parents were happy . " Dr. Levin , " her father kept saying . " Dr. Karen Levin . I like it . " At Gershon 's army physical later that week , a doctor ordered a set of chest X-rays , and a cardiologist asked him if he had ever felt pains in his chest . " Very rapid heartbeat , " the cardiologist said . " Tachycardia . No pains , ever ? " The walls of the drafty room were white and lined with glass cabinets filled with instruments . The floor was of white tile . The cardiologist , a short man with thin graying hair and a graying mustache , waited . Gershon looked at him . The cardiologist stood there quietly , white-frocked , waiting , stethoscope dangling from his neck . " No , " Gershon said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershon walked to the sub-  | way and found his hands were trembling . A gate had been swung open for him onto a safe and certain path , and he had turned away . Why ? Because whatever it was that he was waiting for would never come to him in this twilight urban world of fragments ? He did not know . He passed the physical . His aunt and uncle stared at the letter advising him that he had been made a commissioned officer in the United States Army . The miracle they had expected had not come . The week he was informed that he had passed his physical , two houses in the neighborhood burned . His aunt , horrified , took that as a bad omen . " It is a sign , a sign , " she whispered fearfully . " Dear God , help us . " He turned away from her dread . " Again a soldier ? " his uncle said . " Can not endure it . Can not . Flesh and blood . No more . Can not endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the bookstore . Gershon stopped by the store one morning on the way to the train and found him in a dusty clutter of books and ritual objects . " You could do nothing ? " his uncle asked . " Nothing ? A wasted year ? " He could do nothing , Gershon said , and wondered if he spoke the truth . In early April he submitted to Jakob Keter a research paper on which he had worked since the start of the year . Keter read the paper the same day he received it , remaining awake late into the night . He was reminded of the first paper he had read by Gershon Loran  --  in the garden of his Jerusalem home . He sat now in the living room of the rented apartment , amid the green of potted plants , and finished reading the paper . He put it aside and read it again a few days later . They walked in the warm spring air along the Drive and talked about the paper . It was very technical talk concerning methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts generally ascribed to the early talmudic tradition . Were the abracadabra passages as early as the hymns and prayers and Throne-Chariot descriptions found in the text or were they later additions ? Were they original to rabbinic Judaism or inauthentic accretions ? They talked into the early evening , then walked over to the delicatessen on Broadway near Columbia for supper . Gershon ordered a corned beef sandwich and a beer . He ate slowly . The ceiling fluorescents hummed and flickered . The place was crowded  | and warm with the odors of sour pickles and hot spiced meats and sauerkraut  --  the scents remembered from the many times he had eaten here with Arthur Leiden . " You have on your face more than your normal measure of sadness , " Jakob Keter said . " What is wrong ? " " Memories , " Gershon said . " And anticipations . Do you really think I ought to go up to Harvard to have a look at that manuscript ? " " Yes . If a microfilm is unobtainable . It will , think , substantiate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest Oxford , but that is untenable . " " I might drop in on Arthur . " " Leiden ? " " Yes . " " The dean tells me he is in the navy , or is very soon to enter . They are an interesting family . Do you know them ? " " No . " " The father is a great physicist , and the mother is a splendid art historian . She specializes in oriental art . I met them in Berlin soon after they were married . I knew many of the physicists . I thought once to become a mathematician or a physicist . They were a small international family . Everyone knew what was in everyone else 's pot . " " Arthur and I roomed together for two years , and I never found out why he left physics and came to the seminary . " " Indeed ? Your reticence conceals much . And his exuberance conceals much . I think , if you will excuse me , that reticence and exuberance are often splendid soil for talk that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the waiter ? The roast duck was passable . I think I shall have a black coffee and a strudel . " " Will you call the people in Harvard , if I have to go ? " " Certainly . You should see the Munich manuscript . It is in splendid condition . But Munich and Oxford will be for another time . Yes ? I have been back to Germany twice since the end of the war . I saw Dresden . In my darkest imaginings I could not envision such destruction . An ocean of fire from American fire bombs . Yet I felt no compassion for the Germans . And that distressed me . To think that Germany had succeeded in destroying a man 's capacity to feel corn-  | passion toward human suffering . That is perhaps her greatest sin . No , I made no mistake when I left for Jerusalem . Those who remained , they made the mistake . Ah , finally , our waiter . " The waiter was the same palsied , elderly man who had over the years served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked now . " The handsome one with the blond hair and the fancy accent ? " " In the navy , " Gershon said . " A chaplain . " " You do n't say ? He should come home in good health . " They ordered dessert . He cleared the table and went off . The noise inside the delicatessen was loud . Waiters shouted their orders to the aproned men behind the front counter . The flickering fluorescents had begun to trouble Gershon 's eyes . The walls and tables dimmed and flared . They returned to technical talk over dessert . " Malkuson may be able to resolve that for us , " Keter said at one point . " It may appear in a parallel rabbinic text . I should have studied more Talmud in my young days . It was a mistake . Did someone tell me you received ordination from a yeshiva ? " " Yes , " Gershon said , and named the school and his teachers . " May one ask why you left Talmud ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer that I do n't know . It does n't hold me . It does n't seem to grasp my feelings and imagination . But I really do n't know . " " How interesting . Are you done ? Come . I will walk with you to your subway station . It is a pity you must travel now all the way to Brooklyn . Come . " To the man behind the cash register Gershon said , " You ought to fix those fluorescents . They hurt the eyes . " " Sure thing , " the man said , punching keys . " Got a guy coming in this week . You got two pennies ? " Outside the evening street was crowded with strollers . The air was cool and clear . They walked slowly together . " I am able to recollect clearly why I left mathematics and physics , " Jakob Keter said as they slowly crossed a side street . " I had a vision one day that science in our century would lead to death . There were many roads in my vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads twisted and turned and became a huge road marked with the word death . ' It is certainly a vision that was unfair to science . But it  | showed me my feelings , and I went elsewhere . I did not wish to become what I had beheld . You understand ? Yes . Be careful . Why is there such a piece of wood in the middle of a sidewalk ? And so I decided instead to explore the demonic that leads to life , rather than the demonic that leads to death . It seemed to me that nothing was more demonically creative in all of Jewish history than Kabbalah . I was not mistaken . Shall we buy a newspaper ? I hear Einstein is quite ill . Yes . You have not heard ? We nearly lost Truman last summer . We lost Fermi in November . And , I am afraid , we are about to lose Einstein . How intriguing that all were at the graduation last June . This is your station . Yes ? Good night , Gershon . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then about Harvard . " He rode home and walked through the littered streets of his neighborhood . Which house would burn tonight ? In the morning he heard over the radio that Einstein was dead . He had a vision of him standing at the podium in the dark cap and gown and yellow hood . " A quality of fearfulness , a quality of sublimity .... " Jakob Keter was profoundly upset when Gershon saw him the following day . That was the first time he saw Keter 's face without its mask of expressionlessness . " I can not come to terms with our mortality , " he heard Keter say in the living room of the apartment . " I simply can not . It is all one vast obscurity , one vast hopelessness . A veil . We know nothing , we can hope for nothing . Nothing . " He paused , standing by the window and gazing out at the river and the late afternoon sun . His longish face was drawn . A blood vessel beat visibly on the side of his bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gershon looked past him at the fading day . Then Keter said , still staring out the window , " It will not be necessary for you to go to Harvard . There is a microfilm , and they will send it . We will have a coffee and return to our work . It is a fine sunset . Yes . Very fine . Come , we go back to work . " He turned away from the window . " I did not tell you . This will probably be my final year here . I will know definitely soon , but I think I will be returning to the Hebrew University after the summer . It is almost certain . " He gazed at Gershon , his face once again impassive . " So . You go west , and I go east . Yes . Well . Shall we have a coffee and return to our text ? Come , Gershon . Come .

" " How shall we celebrate ? " " Let 's read a kabbalistic hymn . " " Gershon ! " " Let 's not go anywhere . Let 's just stay here . " " There 's a little club on Seventy-second . I 'm in the mood .

" " Not very likely , my Gershon . Not even at eighty . I know about your secret kabbalistic powers . " " Sure . Abracadabra . You and Keter . He says I have a splendid way of expressing myself on paper . Splendid . Half the time I 'm not even sure I 'm coherent . " " My poor Gershon . " " I 'm tired , Karen . The year is over . Gone .

I 'll have stayed the same , and you 'll be different . Will we want to make the effort to grow toward each other if we 're not married ? I 'm really scared . " They were silent awhile . The window was open . A night wind stirred the curtains and brought into the room the chill scent of the river . " Do n't worry , " he said finally . " I 'll make magic against radical change . Do n't like radical change . Prefer smooth drifting to and fro , to and fro , like so , to and fro . " " Gershon . " " I do love you , " he said . " You doctor of philosophy . " " You kabbalist . Gershon . Oh . " Later , in the early morning , he came out of the subway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Cats played in the open garbage pails . The apartment house was silent . The floors creaked beneath his feet . He got into bed and saw sunlight on his windows and fell asleep . He woke at noon . He put his insignia on his uniform that day and stood before the tall mirror in the living room . He was alone in the apartment . The uniformed officer in the mirror was a stranger to him . He felt his heart beating rapidly . He took the uniform off and put it back into the closet . He would not tell himself how frightened he was . He spent the day reading . It rained much of that week . He saw Karen twice , traveling back and forth by subway . At the end of the following week , on a wet day , he sat on the edge of her bed , watching her pack . She was going with her family to the Berkshires for the summer . She would use the summer to prepare her lectures , she said . He told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Slocum , outside New Rochelle . There was little chance they would see each other . " Will you write me ? " she asked . " Yes . " " Where will they send you after the summer ? " " I do n't know . "  | " I feel cold . It 's so dreary outside . Please hold me , Gershon . " He returned home by subway and spent Shabbat with his aunt and uncle . The apartment was dense with their sighs and silences . He lay awake Saturday night listening to the noises of the neighborhood . The year was crumbling slowly away , and he held in his hands nothing . He took the subway to New York that Sunday afternoon and went up to Jakob Keter 's apartment . Two valises stood neatly packed in the hallway . The curtains were open . Through the windows Gershon saw the river covered by heavy mist . He could not see the cliffs . The indoor plants stood full and leafy . Who would water them now ? Were the lessees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly packing papers and a few books into an attache case . " I am taking your paper with me , " Keter said . " I will return it to you by mail . " " You can send it to my home . It will be forwarded . " " Is there a chance you will be sent overseas ? " " Yes . " " Well , if you are sent to Europe , perhaps you will visit me in Jerusalem . " He closed the attache case and stood there looking at Gershon . " Well , " he said . " It is finished . I have been away too long . " He paused . " When you get out of the army , what will you do ? " " I do n't know . " " Yes . I understand . It can be a long and uncertain passage . Yes . " Gershon said nothing . Jakob Keter gazed at him . " You will continue to read . Yes ? Take with you what books you can . Come . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . " They came into the small , brightly lighted kitchen . Keter puttered about . He wore a dark suit , a white shirt , and a red bow tie . His bald head shone in the light . He put cups of coffee on the table and sat down across from Gershon . " Do you know yet where you will be assigned ? " " No . " " I was in the German army briefly during the First World War . I detested it . But I was not a chaplain . "  | Gershon said nothing . An electric clock hummed softly on the wall . Jakob Keter sipped slowly from his cup . " It is not pleasant to be alone . Keep yourself busy , Gershon . Read , write , move about . Do not permit yourself to brood . Can I give you another coffee ? " Later they came out of the elevator together into the wide and elegant entrance hall . The tall leafy plants shone before the wall mirrors in their bath of artificial light . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked together to the subway station on Broadway . " You have my Jerusalem address ? " Jakob Keter asked . " Yes . " " Write to me from time to time , Gershon . Do not hesitate to call on me . I will make every effort to respond . " " Thank you , " Gershon heard himself say . " Goodbye , Gershon . It was a pleasure to be your teacher . Goodbye . " They shook hands . Gershon took the subway home . That night he came out of the apartment and climbed the stairs to the roof . He stumbled on a rickety step during his ascent and bruised his knee . The building smelled of mold and moisture and decay . On the roof he walked to the low stone parapet and gazed down at the street . In the pools of light cast by the lamps lay the refuse of days . The street was silent save for an occasional car . Ruts and bumps caught the lights in a dance of shadows that gave the asphalt street a rippled liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redolence borne to him by gentle currents of air . The roof , with its fissured tar and rusting pipes , was empty . No bitch whelping life on this rotting roof tonight . Only a vast emptiness of sky and earth . What had he really accomplished all these past months ? The year lay behind him like a shallow trench , a murky indistinct betweenness . He wished Arthur had not forced the choice upon him with that curious gesture of helpfulness . He wondered where Arthur was , what base , what ship . Distant street lights winked in the darkness . The sky seemed cold , as if its galaxies and debris mirrored an ancient abandonment . No one could really climb the transcendent heaven now . The rabbinic mystics with their strange ascents  --  a different time , a different place . The secret face lay silent behind a thousand seals . He could touch  | Einstein 's heaven , Arthur 's father 's heaven , yes . But it would remain closed , and icy to his fingers . No chariot into the chambered heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? He shivered in the hot night air and was nearly overcome by a sadness that had no face and no name . It was a deep and fearful sadness , a palpable realm , a sefirah , as real an emanation of the Divine Being as were royalty , wisdom , understanding , power , grace , and the others . He gazed into its melancholy darkness and saw again all the abandonments of his life , all the incompleteness . Warm breezes bore in upon him with vagrant scents : the musky odors of an ailanthus , the thick smells of frying meat , the stench of alley garbage . If he were to climb now , attempt the ascent , storm the palaces with all the things he knew , he would perhaps see the Throne . Yes . And upon it would be the Essence of all Being  --  encased in dark shrouds of melancholy . He needed no such ascent . His small trench of earth was a parallel sadness . Still  --  he stood on the roof and waited . From the east came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An aircraft came slowly into view , low overhead , its cabin lights visible , its wing lights flashing , exhaust flames pouring from its four engines . It shook the air as it passed , roaring . He followed its rise , watched its westward flight until its sound was gone , and only its lights winked in the darkness that was background to the cold stars . Then the lights were gone . He stood there , waiting . And after a while he knew that nothing would come that night . He went slowly from the roof and down the stairs and into the apartment . It was a long time before he was able to sleep . The next week he put on his uniform and took a train , a bus , and a ferry to Fort Slocum , a tiny island close by New Rochelle and the Bronx . Gulls wheeled over the slate-gray water near the dock on the island . There he spent the summer , in sweltering heat , attending classes with other uniformed men . Weekends he spent in Brooklyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him as if in a dreamlike trance . He marched and saluted and listened in a strange stupor to lectures on counseling , map-reading , combat , administrative procedures . He felt himself entered upon a twisting passage , a  | fearful course of space and time , and he shielded himself from dread with a wall of melancholy indifference . In later years he would remember almost nothing of this curious period . Pieces of paper began to pass him from command to command . In September a bus brought him to Fort Knox , Kentucky . There he lived in a small room with a narrow bed , a desk , a bureau . Heavy vehicles woke him in the mornings . The distant thunder of artillery rattled the windows . Young soldiers lunged in bayonet charges and broke their hands and crushed their fingers in the machinery of tanks . He lay in tents in the field in cold and rain and listened to barked commands drift through morning mist . Helicopters flew overhead , chopping the air . He conducted services and counseled frightened young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The division , with its men and armor , was due to go to Germany in the coming summer  --  and just as he began to look forward to that , began to grow accustomed to the specters of death in which he was enmeshed , he was told that a mistake had been made , he did not qualify to move with the division , he would be out of the army too soon , less than a year , after the move . He lay on his narrow bed and listened to the tanks and the artillery . He wrote to his aunt and uncle , to Karen , and to Jakob Keter . He received no reply from Keter . Then he received a new piece of official paper , new orders . He had little to pack and no one on the base to whom he really wished to say goodbye . In late January he took a bus back to New York . That was a bad time . Karen wept and wondered if they had made a mistake . Her dissertation was being prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching ; she lived alone in an apartment near her parents  --  and she lay against him and cried . He said little , and afterward remembered nothing of his words to her . His aunt and uncle gazed at him with a special sort of horror in their eyes  --  but toward the end , when he was soon to leave , they seemed to change . They would help him through it , they said . They would send him packages , magazines , newspapers , food , whatever he needed . " You need Kabbalah books , Gershon , " his uncle said , coughing , " write and I will send . " " Yes , " his aunt said , clinging to him . " We will help . " The old man in the synagogue who had taught him Aramaic  | gave him the amulet . " What can it hurt ? " he murmured through his tobacco-stained beard . " It means nothing . But what can it hurt ? " In the middle of February he boarded a commercial airliner  --  a double-decker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He flew in pure terror , staring down at the distant , gliding , snow-covered earth . He signed into Fort Lewis and spent Shabbat in Seattle in the home of a seminary rabbi who had been ordained nine years back . The rabbi 's wife had a master 's in art history from the University of Chicago . The meals were noisy . There were three young children . The phone rang often . " Make sure to see Kyoto , " the rabbi 's wife said . " And Nikko . " He went to the Friday evening service and , back in the house , read into the night . The rabbi had a splendid library . Many of the books looked unread . " You read the Cordovero ? " the rabbi said the next day . " I have n't had a chance to look at it yet . Not much time for reading . The publishers sent it to me . I do n't much like Kabbalah . Spooky stuff . " " Make sure you get to Kyoto and Nikko , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " Make sure . " They stood in the doorway with their children and watched him get into the cab . Two days later a Military Air Transport Service DC-6 brought him to Hawaii . He walked in sultry night air beneath luxuriant palm trees , felt beneath his feet the sand of a golden beach , listened to high , dark waves , and saw a vast stretching sky filled with cold stars . The next day he boarded a navy Constellation . Somewhere over the Pacific they lost a day , and he lost track of time . He slept a great deal and ate little . He would wake from dazed sleep in the canvas seat , his body stiff and aching , and ask himself what time it was , what day . They landed on Wake Island to refuel . His eyes felt singed by the sun on the white lava . They flew into the night , and he saw the wing lights flashing and blinking and the exhaust gases burning behind the engines . They landed in Japan , and he slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor officers barracks in Camp Drake near Tokyo . Thirty-six hours later a huge , big-bellied , double-deckered C-I24 Globemaster named the Thin Man brought him to Kimpo Air Force Base in Korea . The journey had taken ten days .  | WMA They landed in late afternoon on Friday in blowing snow . He saw granite hills and bare brown valleys . A frozen river flashed by just before he felt the heavy touch of the wheels on the tarmac . He trudged with the others in a fierce wind toward a nearby cement building . In the tall windows the name Thin Man on the Globemaster showed in reverse . The outside walls bore the leprous tracings of war : stark pits and gouges of bullets and shells . He saw all and saw nothing . The wind whipped against his face and blew snow into his eyes . He felt himself still on the aircraft . The ground yawed and swayed and oscillated beneath his feet . As they walked , a huge aircraft went into its takeoff run . The windows in the building shook , blurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil stove gave off heat . His eyes ached with the fatigue of travel and altered time . Soon they were herded into a bus . He gazed out a window and through a thin film of snow saw barbed wire fences and empty fields . All in the bus were officers , and all sat in silence . It was late afternoon , the air gray with the shadows of clouds . A strange landscape floated by : pale , globular lights , dense shadows , blurred figures , wet vehicles , misshapen dwellings , horse-drawn carts , women with vacant faces , children with running noses and facial sores . Objects drifted toward him out of the snow and flashed by and vanished . All this he saw , and yet he saw nothing . The bus brought them to a replacement depot , and he walked again in the snow . A jeep pulled up , and the driver called out his name . He felt eyes staring at him through the snow . The jeep had a canvas top and plastic side and rear windows . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of a torn city to  | a chapel in a military compound . " Welcome , welcome , " the Jewish chaplain greeted him . " How I have been waiting for you ! Welcome ! " The interior of the chapel was very hot . The chaplain was a major , round , cheerful , pink-cheeked . " Take off your coat . Relax . Stay awhile . Ha , ha ! Can I get you a cup of coffee ? " He stayed there Shabbat and attended services . Saturday night and Sunday they celebrated Purim . The night service was well attended . Afterward he sat in the chapel office with the chaplain , who was methodically emptying the contents of a bottle of bourbon into himself . " Why do n't you join in ? " the chaplain kept asking . " Jewish law says to get tight on Purim . Must join in . Celebrate . Happy Purim . Have one . Have two . Go ahead . " The office was hot . The lids of the oil stoves in the chapel glowed pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershon , " Listen . Watch out in this place , you hear ? Watch yourself . Many temptations . Beware . Where there are no men , you be a man . Understand ? Have another drink . Place full of pits and traps . I leave untouched . Two more months and goodbye . Hate this place , hate it . But I leave untouched . Not like so many others . No , do n't touch the stoves . Like it to be warm . Like it toasty . Cold outside , hot inside . Like it that way . Finish your drink . Freshen it up a bit ? Two more months . My God ! This is not a place for Jews . " The next afternoon Gershon reported to the Eighth Army chief of chaplains . " Glad to have you with us , chaplain . Please sit down . Tired ? " He was a short trim man with warm , gray eyes and a kindly face . " I 'll bet you 're tired . Well , we can put you with headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel when he leaves , or we can put you up north with a division . " He gazed across the desk at Gershon and waited . The wind blew against the translucent plastic windows of the office . Gershon looked at the maps on the wall and the Bible on the desk and at the cross and silver birds on the chief of chaplains ' uniform . " North , " he said , and was not sure why he said it . The chief of chaplains looked at him a moment , nodded briefly , and shook his hand . That afternoon a jeep returned him to the replacement depot . He slept on a cot in a wide room filled with officers . A bus brought him to the railroad station in Seoul the next morning . He rode north in an old rickety train with wooden seats and protective iron grates  | outside the windows . The train was cold and crowded with officers and enlisted men . Some were returning from leave in Japan and were raucous with happy memories . Others sat staring out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , stopping often . Gershon sat next to a heavy-set infantry major who was asleep . Thick blowing snow had obliterated the landscape . A blank whiteness pressed against the windows . He rode through the day and watched the snow slowly darken . On occasion the snow was parted by a sudden gust , and he saw thatched huts and narrow valleys and steep hills . Once a dog ran alongside the train for a moment , then vanished . The windows turned slate-gray . The train stopped with a jarring lurch and was engulfed in dense , driven , buffeting clouds of snow . He could feel the car quivering in the wind . They started up again , slowly , and went on slowly a long time . It was dark when they came to their destination , and all inside were silent with exhaustion . He stood on the station in the snow , and someone called out instructions . He rode in the back of a two-and-ahalf-ton truck over rutted snow-packed icy roads . In a replacement depot whose generator was inoperative he handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of flickering candles . Long shadows danced on the floor and walls . A dark form materialized at his side . He felt a tap on his shoulder and saw , vaguely , a hand motioning to him . They went over to a dark corner away from the others . The young man introduced himself in a low voice . " Charlie Taron , rabbi . Headquarters . I never thought we 'd get a Jewish chaplain this far up north . Boy . Welcome . Listen . You need any paperwork done real fast , rabbi , you pick up the phone and call me . I got friends all up and down . We 'll walk the work through for you . Wo n't sit a minute on anyone 's desk . Okay ? Just pick up the phone . Great to see you , rabbi . Really great . " Later he walked through drifting snow to the mess hall . He ate the vegetables and ignored the fried chicken . He had coffee and accepted the cigarette offered him by a medical captain . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of his uncle  --  white goatee , lined , pallid features , weary eyes , coughing . What time was it now in the States ? He did not know . His eyes were heavy , and he felt the quickening beat of his heart .  | He slept in a cot in a crowded Quonset , and in the night the oil stove died , and he had in his life never believed such cold could exist . He woke into the cold . He lay on an icy pillow . His sheets were icy . He dared not move . He listened to the snow blowing against the Quonset . He opened his eyes and stared into utter unrelieved darkness . The Quonset was silent save for the deep breathing and snores of sleeping men . He shivered uncontrollably and felt all his body naked to the air . To take his mind off the cold , he reached into himself and summoned forth remembered Merkavah texts of ancient ascents through chill skies . He lay in the darkness and imagined letters and words playing clearly before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that hour when I ascended on high , I made marks at the entrances of heaven . . . and when I came to the curtain , angels of destruction went forth to destroy me .

" ' " And Gershon saw too the words spoken by Metatron , the prince of God , the messenger , to Rabbi Ishmael : " Come and behold the letters by which the heaven and the earth were created , the letters by which the mountains and hills were created , the letters by which the seas and rivers were created . . . the letters by which the planets and zodiacal signs were created . . . the letters by which the Throne of Glory and the wheels of the Merkavah were created . ... And I walked by his side and he took me by his hand and raised me upon his wings and showed me those letters , all of them , that are graven with a flaming style on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . . . . " And he remembered these words of Rabbi Akiva : " I beheld and saw the whole universe and perceived it as it is ; I ascended in a carriage of fire .... " The texts were of no comfort . He fell into a fitful sleep . In the morning a jeep took him between roadside hillocks of snow to the office of the division chaplain . Sunlight shone on the snow and hurt his eyes . The tents and Quonsets of the division lay buried in the snow . Men were digging paths behind the barbed wire fences . He rode to a Quonset at the foot of a low hill . The division chaplain was a short , portly lieutenant colonel with a completely bald head , slightly bulging blue eyes , and moist lips . He had short fingers , a pudgy hand , and a protruding belly . " Hello , hello . They told us you were coming . The place takes getting used  | to , does n't it . Well , let 's see . What 'll we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on division level yet . No . Fort Knox ? Really ? Imagine . Big army . Right hand does n't know left hand . Did n't think you guys ever went below corps . Okay . Anyway , anyway . Let 's see . Schmidt is going , so is Rose . Thompson coming in . So . Okay . It looks like this . Got a spot for you . Nice spot . Put you in the medics . You 'll take care of the battalion and all the Jewish personnel in the division . Wait until you see the chapel . Nicest one in the whole division . Needs some finishing . But beautiful . New . The present assistant is not Jewish . A Mormon boy , I believe . You can change him if you want . All set ? Good luck . Give me a call if you need anything . That 's my job . Keep you happy , keep me happy . Okay ? " That afternoon a jeep took him to his new unit , and a company clerk directed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jamesways in the officers ' section of the compound . It was a small , hutlike canvas dwelling with a wooden floor , a cot , a makeshift desk and washstand . Two walls curved inward to form an arching roof . The windows were plastic . He lay awake that night and listened to the wind blow fresh snow against the hut . After a while he fell asleep . Sometime in the night the fuel line attached to the oil drum outside froze , and the fire died in the potbellied stove . He woke and lay very still in the narrow bed . The air grew so cold it seemed to burn . He lay awake and listened to the rapid beating of his heart . He had been gone now fifteen days . He woke to a bitter cold morning brilliant with sunshine . Similar days followed . An icy sun had settled upon the land . The winds seemed strangely cruel , and when he asked about them he was told that they blew down from the Siberian tundras in the north . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fur-lined parka and hood , and gloves , and was always cold . He seemed unable to adjust to the new cycle of time , caught himself dozing at odd hours of the day and lay wide awake long into the nights . He had little appetite during meals . His eyelids and head felt weighted . From time to time he gazed at his reflection in mirrors and did not know who he was . On the morning of his first full day , he had reported to the  | battalion commanding officer , a short trim man with red hair , pale eyes , and a small mouth . " Anything I can do to help , chaplain . Anything . Let me know . Morale is very important in my outfit . Keep it high . Men get the blues , work falls to pieces . Learned that in the big war . I flew the big bombers . That 's right . Bombed the hell out of Japan in the big war . When morale in a plane goes down , so does the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine chapel . I 'm very proud of our chapel . Did you see the hospital ? We definitely need a new hospital . Well , good luck . Welcome aboard , chaplain . " Later that morning he met his assistant and was taken through the chapel . The assistant was a shy lad fresh out of high school , blond-haired , ruddy-cheeked , smiling , his deep blue eyes covered by shell-rimmed glasses that gave him a misty daydreamer 's look . His name was Roger Tat . He wore neatly pressed olive-greens , polished boots , and the maroon scarf of the medical battalion , and he showed Gershon around the chapel . The office at the rear of the chapel was large and neat . There were two desks and filing cabinets and chairs and bookcases . There were windows , a typewriter , a field telephone . The room had its own oil stove . The air was warm , comfortable . But Gershon felt cold . " And here I keep the Bibles , sir . And the prayer books for the different services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in a soft voice . " Where are you from , Roger ? " " Salt Lake City , sir . " " Is that music paper on your desk ? " " I write music , sir . But only in my spare time . " " Can you drive a jeep ? " " Oh yes , sir . And I 'm very good with a weapon . " " You are ? " " Yes , sir . I am required to carry my weapon whenever we travel outside division by jeep . " " Where are the Jewish services held now ? " " At regiment , sir . The Jewish prayer books are there . " " I think I 'll want the services moved here . I do n't travel on my Sabbath . " " Yes , sir . Seventh-Day Adventists are here now Friday night and Saturday morning , sir . "  | " They are ? " " Yes , sir . " " We 'll have to think what to do about that . Do we get our own jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already arranged for that , sir . I also called division air and told them you 'll be flying about a lot . " " You did ? " " We have a regiment in the hills beyond the thirty-eighth parallel , sir . " " We do ? No one told me that . How far beyond ? " " More than an hour away by jeep , sir . Over a range of hills . " " Show me the rest of the chapel , Roger . " It was a fine chapel : white walls , clean cement floor , metal chairs , large pulpit with lecterns , flags , candelabrum . A stove stood in the center of the floor between the rows of chairs , the flue climbing out through the curved ceiling . My first .. synagogue , Gershon said to himself . A pulpit rabbi . InKorea . But the chapel still wore a raw look ; it had about it an air of incompleteness . He gazed at the altar and the lectern : lacquered light wood reflecting the diffused sunlight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished to a high shine . He felt for the first time since leaving New York the vague warmth of a comforting eagerness . They spent some time together in the office , setting up the files and records and counseling hours . The field phone rang a few times , inquiries from various units about the truth of the rumor that a Jewish chaplain was now with the medical battalion . Gershon sat behind his large dark-wood desk and listened to Roger Tat 's replies . The oil stove burned smoothly , warming the air . Still he felt cold . Later , on the way to the officers mess for lunch , he thought to circle the chapel to have a look at it from the outside . It was clean and white . Patches of snow clung to the roof . A narrow bed of crushed whitish rock , much of it covered with snow , gave it a neat border and a New England look . In the morning he had entered the chapel through the rear door that led to the office . Now he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its base and were smoothly molded to the curve of the roof . The door was also of wood , its brass knobs and hinges glistening in the sun . The wood had been stained a rich walnut , the grain showing in undulating  | circles and loops and arabesques . Incised deeply into the panel next to the door , and taking up nearly the entire height of the entrance , was a cross . On the roof above the entrance rose a delicately angled steeple topped by a short white wooden cross that glinted in the sunlight . Gershon had seen the crosses the day before ; yet he had not seen them . Now he stood there looking at the two crosses . After a while he turned and walked the length of the compound to the officers mess . The compound lay in a flat valley alongside the main supply route from Seoul . This was a wide unpaved road crowded with military traffic . Beyond the road was the railroad . The division airstrip lay parallel to the tracks . Single-engined L-19 's and Beavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordered the airstrip . Gershon sat alone at a table in the officers mess and gazed out the glass panes of a window at the hill behind the battalion . He ate the scrambled eggs which he had asked the chef to substitute for the ham menu , stipulating that the eggs be fried only in vegetable oil . The chef , an elderly Korean with brown , leathery skin and shiny , dark eyes , had nodded agreeably , uncomprehendingly . Beyond the mess was the bar and club room , which was empty . Officers ate quickly and left . There were brief introductions , handshakes . Some of the officers were from New York . What 's new , chappy ? Anything new ? Anything ? You hear about that cold wave in the east ? Yeah , in Stars and Stripes . Good to have you with us . Join you , chaplain ? How was the trip ? Is that all you 're eating ? He returned to the chapel after lunch . Two young soldiers were waiting to see him . Counseling . Roger busied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later Gershon came out of the chapel office into the cruel and bitter cold of the early winter night , went around to the entrance , gazed at the crosses , and trudged across the frozen compound to his quarters . He wrote a letter to his aunt and uncle , requesting certain books and canned meats . He washed in a basin with potable water from a five-gallon can , shaved with his electric razor , which he had attached with extension cords to the three-way plug in the ceiling wire into which also was screwed an electric bulb . The interior of the Jamesway , with its cot and makeshift desk and old wooden  | chair and rickety bookcase and packing-crate dresser , looked jerrybuilt but neat and clean . A Korean boy , whom he shared with other officers , cleaned , did his laundry , polished his boots . The boy had appeared in the early morning ? " I your houseboy , sah " ? and , without a further word , had gone to work . Gershon stood near the basin , combed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hung from a nail he had found protruding conveniently from one of the Jamesway ribs , and saw the pallid skin and the dark circles beneath the eyes . He saw the face and did not see it . He went out of the Jamesway into the cutting wind . It seemed to be watching for him , that wind , waiting to pounce and clutch . He walked quickly to the officers mess . The battalion commander hailed him from a table . His small puckered lips formed a small smile around his cigarette . He tilted his head , closing one eye against the smoke . " How 'd it go today , chaplain ? " " Fine , sir . " " What do you think of our chapel ? " " It 's quite nice , sir . " " I built that chapel . It beats dropping bombs , I 'll tell you that . Is your assistant working out okay ? " " He seems very good , sir . " " Glad to hear it , chaplain . Enjoy your dinner . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors at their table , waived the steak , and ate the vegetables . The doctors talked about two men brought in the night before . They had drunk anti-freeze in an attempt to keep warm . A guard had found them in a jeep near the quartermaster compound . One had died that morning ; the other had survived but was blind . Mountain kids . The Ozarks . Keep warm and die . Do n't even realize that booze makes you colder . Koreans know how to keep warm . Fire on one side of hooch , smoke under floor and out other side . Keeps you warm . Was the boy going to die ? Gershon asked . " No , " one of the doctors said . " Too bad , chaplain , " the other doctor said . " He 's better off dying , " the first doctor said . " All concur there was brain damage . " The two doctors got to their feet and sauntered into the club . Gershon returned to his Jamesway.  | He lay in his bed reading a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at eleven o'clock the battalion generator shut down . The bulb went brown and died . He stared into the darkness . The oil stove burned with a low , even flame . He thought to use the piss tubes behind the hut , but he feared the cold . He closed his eyes . After a moment he had a blurred vision of his aunt and uncle . They stood before the chapel gazing at the entrance panels and the steeple . He saw them speaking but could not make out their words . He fell asleep . In the night the fuel line froze , and the fire died . He woke and felt the cold like flaming air upon his skin . The next morning he learned over breakfast that one of the tents in a nearby infantry regiment had burned down during the night . The stove had been set too high in an effort to keep the line from freezing . No one was hurt . He finished his breakfast , crossed the compound , and came into the hospital . The boy who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathing shallowly . He had blond hair and skin the color of chalk . There were tubes in his arms . An orderly stood near the cot . " He 's going out by chopper to the evac hospital , " the orderly said in a low voice . Gershon stared at the boy . " Did someone call the division chaplain 's office ? " " I do n't know anything about that , sir . " Gershon could not take his eyes off the boy . The blanket over his still form rose and fell slowly with his breathing . He turned abruptly and went back out through the hospital and crossed the short intervening ground to the chapel . The hospital comprised lines of parallel Quonsets connected by short corridors that leaked air and were cold . The Quonsets were dingy and dilapidated and poorly lighted . Beyond the hospital were the tents of the noncommissioned officers and enlisted personnel . The tents and Quonsets were a dreary olive-green in the morning sunlight . Roger sat at his desk , reading . He looked up when Gershon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind soldier , " Gershon said .  | " I 've already done that , sir . " He closed his book and placed it with stiff care on his desk . " You have ? Well , good . Wl at are you reading , Roger ? " " The Book of Mormon , sir . " " COuld they have been that cold ? To drink anti-freeze ? " " They were n't the first to do that . " " Is there anything that needs to be done by me this morning ? " " We ought to set up a schedule of services , sir . " " Yes . All right . Thank you , Roger . " They sent memos to the division commander , attention office of the division chaplain , requesting that Jewish services be moved from regiment to medics , that the Seventh-Day Adventist service be moved from medics to regiment , that the Jewish prayer books , synagogue vestments , and religious articles be moved from regiment to medics , and that the new schedule of services be approved and published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memo requesting that the battalion carpenters construct a set of Jewish tablets for the chapel , estimated time required one hour . " Best to include a drawing of the tablets , sir , " said Roger . " Thank you . " Later in the morning he counseled a sergeant whose wife back home was threatening to leave him and a corporal who had been caught the night before in the nearby village with a whore . " She keeps me warm , chaplain , sir . " He sat in the chair and spoke directly and unashamedly to Gershon . " I ca n't take the cold . I go to the village all the time . Damn MP 's got nothing to do but raid . " Later Gershon was on his way out to lunch when he heard the helicopter . It landed quickly on the frozen earth , enveloping the valley in its buffeting noise . Men rushed from the hospital and strapped to the helicopter stretcher a still form . The helicopter raised itself from the earth , circled tentatively , and flew off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small crowd that had gathered began to disperse . Gershon crossed the compound to the officers mess . During lunch he sat quietly with some doctors and listened to them talk about nonspecific urethritis . " Outpaced only by upper respiratory infections , " said one doctor . " I do n't have any statistics , but my soul tells me I 'm  | right . " " His soul , " another doctor said . " That 's your department , chaplain . " " A figure of speech , " the first doctor said . " I do n't know about souls , " a third doctor said . " All I know is that if this weather does n't warm up soon , we may run out of penicillin because of all the guys going to the village to get out of the cold . " " It does n't change when the weather gets warm , " the first doctor said . " All agree it does n't change one bit . " On his way back to the chapel after lunch , Gershon stopped near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a sudden brief vision of his aunt and uncle . He saw them go past the entrance guardpost that faced the main supply route . They moved slowly past the rows of ambulances , shuffling on the frozen snow . His uncle held his aunt 's arm . They wore their old dark coats . His uncle had on his gray fedora , and his aunt wore a gray woolen scarf over her white hair . Their eyes were moist with cold . They stopped at the entrance to the chapel and looked up . He could not hear their words . He saw his uncle 's goatee move agitatedly . Then they turned and walked slowly out of the compound and went on up the main supply route and , as Gershon watched , an old Korean came down the wide icy road bent nearly double beneath a load of brush he had brought down from the hills to keep his village hut warm . Aside from a few kabbalistic works , he had also brought with him a small Hebrew Bible and a thin volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon for the Friday evening service , then wrote out a memo to the commanding general , Eighth Army , requesting two altar chairs and sixteen pews with kneelers for the chapel . He titled the memo " Beautification of Medical Battalion Chapel " and sent it to the attention of the Eighth Army chaplain through channels . He wrote : " There are no pews in our medical battalion chapel . Folding chairs are used for pews . These are inadequate because of lack of kneelers . It is estimated that sixteen pews can be constructed for approximately $350 . This will do much to enhance the beauty of the chapel . Further , the pulpit at present has no chairs . The folding chairs that are now being used detract considerably from the beauty of the altar . Two pulpit chairs can be constructed for approximately $16o . All construction can be accomplished with the use of Korean carpenters . "  | To Roger 's look of surprise and admiration , he responded with , " I asked around during lunch . I got a little bored listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " " Oh yes , sir . " Roger quickly typed the memo on the old Underwood on his desk , and Gershon signed it . Outside the air grew dark . He went back to his Jamesway to prepare for dinner . The wind blew knives of ice across the compound . The mucus froze in his nostrils . He saw the guards slowly circling the perimeter fence and could not understand how they suffered the cold . That night after dinner the battalion commander invited Gershon to join him for a drink . They sat at the bar . Gershon had a Scotch . The major was drinking bourbon . The night lay black upon the windows . Men sat at tables drinking and playing cards . Three doctors were rolling for drinks at the bar . There was a mirror over the bar behind the shelves of bottles , and it reflected the naked bulbs that hung from the ceiling wires . The walls were bare and unpainted . At the rear of the club near the door that led out back were stacked unopened cartons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early forties . He had a thin , high voice and a nervous look in his eyes . He was a short man , with thick red hair and small florid features . There was reddish down on the hacks of his hands . " Here 's to you , chaplain . Good luck . " " Thank you , major . " " Yes , sir , I built that chapel . Took some of the material that should have gone into this club and put it into the chapel . Yes , sir . " " It 's a very good chapel , major . " " Needs to be finished , you know . Need to finish this club too . A scandal , this club . We have n't had a chaplain here in about a month . The man who preceded you was a scandal . Enough said . Have another drink , chaplain . Keep you warm . " " Thank you . " One of the company commanders , a burly man with a barrel chest , called from a table , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be there soon , Harry , " the major called back . He sipped from his drink . " You 're from New York ? I flew over New York once in a B-a9 . I looked down and wondered what it would be like if the city  | were bombed . I never looked down at the cities we bombed . Except the night we really fire-bombed Tokyo . I looked down at that . " He sipped again from his glass . " God , I loved flying those planes . I loved the way the seat would grab my backside during takeoff . I loved that . " " My cousin flew fighters during the war , " Gershon said , and immediately wondered why he had offered up that memory . " Did he ? " The major 's smallish face lit up . Gershon found himself bathed in an unexpected stream of admiration . " I could n't qualify with fighters . Reflexes were n't sharp enough . What outfit was he with ? " " I do n't remember . He was shot down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " The major was silent a moment , puckered lips in somber thought . " My bombardier kept saying , We do n't have to look down at the fires , do we ? I 'll drop them but I wo n't look down . ' Damn good bombardier . He could put one down a smokestack . But he would n't look down afterward . Nice kid from Cedar Rapids . Nice kid . " " Hey , Doug , " the company commander called . " We 're aging rapidly . " " I had a quick look at your request for pews , chaplain . Good . Very good . Ca n't leave the chapel the way it is . Scandalous . Finish it . Back you all the way . Have another drink on me . Hey , Paul . " He turned to the orderly behind the bar . " Give the chaplain another drink and put it on my tab . Take it easy , chaplain . " He slid off the bar stool and went somewhat unsteadily to the table , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few minutes later Gershon crossed the compound in a freezing wind . He shivered at the piss tubes near his Jamesway . The warm air of the Jamesway interior was of some comfort as he got out of his clothes . He felt a faint buzzing in his head from the alcohol and seemed unable to rid himself of the sensation of cold . He lay in the cot reading the Kabbalah text by the light of the naked bulb . The wind whistled mournfully against the canvas of the Jamesway . At eleven o'clock the light dimmed and died . He slept fitfully and woke in the night and listened to the dying of the oil stove . It made loud banging cracking sounds as it con-  | tracted into death , the same sounds that would come from the radiators in the old apartment house when the furnace fire went low and the janitor was too drunk to rise . For a moment he thought to go outside and kick at the fuel line to dislodge the ice that was blocking the flow of oil . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas walls vanished , and outside and inside air mingled and seeped through his blankets deep into his bed . He felt the crawl of the cold air across his helpless form , felt the cold in his jaws and teeth and hair follicles , felt entombed in black ice . He slept , finally , in a paralysis of exhaustion . He woke in terror . Along the fringes of a mist-filled dream he had seen the vaguely outlined but unmistakable form of Arthur Leiden beckoning to him . The sight of the figure had filled him with dread . Now , awake , he had no memory of the reason for his fear . He got out of the cot , shivering in the icy air of the Jamesway . You dressed swiftly with numbed fingers inside the frozen membrane surrounding you ; you went out to the piss tubes ; you kicked at the fuel line . You returned to the Jamesway and dropped a lighted match into the stove . The oil caught . You poured water from the five-gallon can into the basin , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamesway began to grow warm . You washed your hands and face and brushed your teeth and shaved . You prayed the morning service . You lingered over passages like " Sovereign of all the worlds : not because of our righteousness do we bring before You our pleas , but because of Your many mercies . What are we ? What is our life ? . . . " And over passages like " Praise the Lord . . . . His word moves swiftly on its course ; He sends down snow white as wool ; He scatters hoar frost thick as ashes ; He hurls pieces of ice like crumbs . " A nd you lingered at some length over the words " Praised be God for the infinite wisdom with which He created the radiance of the sun . . . . The stars all about the heavens proclaim His might . . . . Be You praised , 0 Lord our God , for the excellence of Your handiwork , above all for the stars radiant with light , which You did create . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , who fashioned unseen forces , ministering angels who stand in the heights of the universe . . . and with soft and clear tones chant together a sacred melody : Holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts , all the earth is  | filled with His glory .... ' " You lingered over these words because their meaning was suddenly no longer so clear as you had once thought . Then you finished praying and removed your tefillin and put on your parka and gloves and fur-lined cap and went out into the frozen compound where the wind lashed your face and brought tears to your eyes and stiffened the mucous membranes inside your nostrils . . . . No doubt the prayers had been written with only a Mediterranean climate in mind . What had the words meant all the centuries to those in the vast northern wastes of Russia and Poland ? Dreams ? Visions ? And , as he walked over the frozen snow , glimpsing through wind-induced tears the traffic on the main supply route and soldiers huddled in their parkas , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatless figure  --  dark coat , red scarf , longish face , bald head  --  of Jakob Keter outside the door to the officers mess , where it waited long enough for him to get within about twenty feet of it before it misted over and disappeared . He felt a strange sense of elation and sat at a table with some doctors and chatted and ate a large breakfast . The elation vanished when he entered the chapel . He found waiting in his office the orderly whom he had met at the bedside of the blinded soldier . Roger was seated at his small corner desk ; he sat stiffly , reading , his back very straight , his knees together . " Can I talk to you , rabbi ? " the orderly asked . Gershon removed his cap and gloves and parka . " It 's very personal , " the orderly said . He had curly dark hair and black eyes and a pale intense face the color of paper . On his uniform was the stenciled name Rosen . The stove burned and the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down his book . " I can tend to the jeep , sir . " " How did the major get that memo so quickly , Roger ? " " I walked it through to his desk , sir . " " Thank you . " Roger put on his parka and left . " Sit down , Rosen . What 's your first name ? " " Gabriel , rabbi . " " Where are you from ? " " New York . Brooklyn . Borough Park . " He spoke softly in a tone cadenced with tribal familiarity .  | Borough Park . A citadel of the very orthodox . Private homes with lawns , spacious apartment houses , clean tree-lined streets , large stores , bright with light . There , no houses burned suddenly in the might . There , Jews went about carrying with ease and certainty their freight of inherited responsibilities as guardians of the ancient coveaaant . Gabriel Rosen was a long way from home . " What can I do for you , Gabriel ? " The boy 's pale features suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal : a faint upturning of the lips , a slight narrowing of the eyes . Gershon felt himself being tested for tribal loyalties . " The others chose me to represent them , rabbi . There are six of us in the hospital . Pharmacy , X-ray , things like that . Six of us . " Gershon sat behind his large dark-wood desk and waited . Old annoyances had begun to stir within him like awakening ghosts . " They said to say welcome , rabbi . We 're all real glad you 're here . It 'll make a difference , you know ? Sometimes they give us a hard time . " He paused , smiled thinly , waited . When he realized Gershon would not respond , he wet his lips and went on . " They asked me to ask you about the assistant . That 's the biggest question . The assistant . " Gershon , not understanding , said , " What assistant ? " Gabriel Rosen said , " Your assistant . The goy . " Gershon said , " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontrollably , at the deliberate epithet , the tribeword . Why was his long-forgotten yeshiva past suddenly returning to him in a chapel in Korea ? Weariness ? Lack of sleep ? Change of time zones ? Abrupt exposure to below-zero cold ? Repressed realization of how close he had brought himself  --  without really understanding why  --  to this cliff-edge of death ? Tanks , rifles , artillery , aircraft , soldiers on whose faces lay the stultifying boredom of waiting and the easy familiarity with war and death  --  how wistfully some returning noncoms talked of Korean battlefields and the major talked of his years as a bomber pilot ! Had he , Gershon , been chafed to rawness by only three days in a front-line battalion ? Who was this white-faced , skinny kid from Borough Park who had begun to raise the gorge in his throat , the silenced rage no one had ever heard or seen ? Gershon hoped he could retain self-control , could keep the  | scraping annoyance and buried rage out of his voice . He said , again , " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backing away and with the egalitarian tone of one Jew to another , " We think the assistant should be one of us . A Jew . Not a goy . " " He 's my assistant , Gabriel . No one else 's . " " It 's against Jewish law . Yayin nesech . We ca n't drink wine he touches . " " You think he 'll dedicate the wine to pagan gods , to Jesus , to Buddha ? Do n't worry about it . I 'll pour the wine . You can pour your own wine . If I decide to keep him . " " The others all say it 's wrong , rabbi . " " I 'll decide . Not the others . " " You do n't have to get angry , rabbi . " " Where did you go to school , Gabriel ? " He named a yeshiva in Brooklyn . " You were drafted from a yeshiva ? " " My marks were n't good . The teacher had it in for me . " " What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assistant said services will be held here starting next week . " " That 's right . " " The crosses , rabbi . What can we do about the crosses ? " " I 'll think about it , Gabriel . " " A goy for an assistant and crosses on the shul . Who 'll believe it when I write home ? It 's upside down here . " Gershon sat alone afterward , echoes of the conversation churning within him . Street words lurched through his head , the language of rage . The smug superiority of those certain of salvation . Longdimmed visions of teachers in dingy classrooms teaching the road map of relationships with the Higher Power , the carefully delineated turns and bends , highways , byways , bridges , the surfeit of text and commentary , the richness to the point of glutinous choking , no new lights , no unexpected visions that chilled the spine , and a sharp voice if you turned to stare out the window at the way the pigeons strutted along the sidewalk in the sunlight . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power have awakened those dormant memories ? He was tired , tired . He needed the coming Shabbat . He would rest .  | Roger returned , his face flushed with cold . Icy air blew in through t he momentarily opened door . They went through the mail , administrative newsletters of information from division , from army : preparations for Easter and Passover ; a late spring retreat in Japan ; items to include in the monthly chaplain reports ; how to apply for welfare funds ; how to keep a record of chapel collections . Words , dead words built of dead letters . " Rug sets for cantonment chapels are stocked at the Columbus Depot , United States Army , Columbus 15 , Ohio . The color of the carpeting is Apple Green . . . . " " It is requested that an individual budget for each chapel in Korea be prepared and submitted on attached blanks following instructions furnished in paragraph 4 of Inclosure No. i hereto .... " " Completed budget forms in quadruplicate will be forwarded by supervisory chaplains . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bony , dry with cold . Why was he fixed on his hands ? He felt he could not move them . He sat in his chair at the desk and had the strange sensation that he would never again be able to move . He would will himself to movement , but nothing would happen . Motionless . He felt within himself a cold and heavy weight . Before his test for ordination at the yeshiva he had felt this way : a freighted joylessness ; everything known , the mapped road of reading marked and memorized , no lights , no lights , no bursts of surprise , no ascent from the choreographed landscape of text and commentaries . He took the test and had the distinct sensation he had remained motionless through all the hours of tense questioning in that small room with the long , glass-topped table and the wooden chairs and the cigarette smoke like stale fog through which hummed and shone the ceiling fluorescents . Why was he remembering all this now in t his flat and broken valley in this torn and ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a soft powdery crystal fall of thick , dry flakes , and it came without a wind in a straight descent from a milk-white sky . The air was cold , five below zero , but the absence of wind effected a benevolent deceit upon one 's face and eyes . There could be no thought now of attempting the long walk to regiment that night for the Friday evening service . Today 's Stars and Stripes had headlined the death of forty-four Korean soldiers in a snowslide northeast of Seoul . This was ice-age snow , malevolent , deadly .  | Gershon crossed the compound to his quarters . The Jamesway was swept clean , the bed made , the five-gallon can filled , underwear laundered and folded , washbasin clean and dry , stove burning . The houseboy  --  what was his name ? Something Kim or Kim Something ? had come and gone , invisibly . Gershon washed and shaved and prayed the service alone in the Jamesway . A long moment of calm descended upon him . " Awake , arise , for your light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presence of the Lord has shone upon you ! " And , a while later , he murmured , " And the heaven and the earth were completed and all their host . And on the seventh day God had completed His work . . . . And He rested on the seventh day from all His work . . . . " And , outside , the snow continued to fall , silently , through air strangely still and barely cold . He walked through the snow to the officers mess and chose to eat alone . The mess was noisy ; the bar was crowded . He returned to the Jamesway . The snow had mounted quite some inches above the foot of the door and a hillock tumbled into the Jamesway with the opening of the door and proceeded immediately to melt and form puddles on the plywood floor . For a while he sat very still in the chair and stared into the dimness of the corner across from the washstand . The bulb burned at the end of its naked cord ; the stove gave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas walls unmoving . A deep , thickening silence was falling upon him , a dense white cloak of cottony snow . He felt drowsy in the warmth but knew he was awake . And then he had a vision . He saw clearly Arthur Leiden and Jakob Keter strolling across a large green lawn , talking together inaudibly . In the distance beyond white birch trees lay a crystal lake . Tall leafy oaks graced the summer sky . Along the lawn came Arthur 's mother , bearing a tray of afternoon tea things . She moved gracefully across the grass , lovely but unsmiling , and called to Arthur and to Jakob Keter . They turned their heads toward her . From the sun porch of the house  --  a large stately Tudor  --  came Arthur 's father , together with Albert Einstein and Harry Truman . All converged upon a round glass-topped iron lawn table with white filigreed legs . Deep in conversation , they had their tea . Now , abruptly , Arthur was the only one speaking . They sat around the table on white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother put  | down her cup and walked off the lawn into the house . Arthur 's father , with a gesture of weary resignation , excused himself and followed . A moment or two later Truman and Einstein went off together into the woods alongside the house . Arthur sat alone , gazing at the lake and the birches . He brushed a hand across his eyes . He sat there staring at the birches and the lake , and weeping . Albert Einstein and Harry Truman emerged from the woods and came over to Arthur . All three then sat at the table , talking softly . The vision  --  utterly soundless  --  faded . He sat in the Jamesway , chilled and unnerved , and did not know what to do . The unheard anguish in Arthur filled the air of the hut like a dark snow upon the landscape of a soul . He trembled as he got up from the chair . When he went out to use the piss tubes he found himself nearly knee-deep in snow . The night was muffled , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I le lay in the cot and tried to read his Kabbalah text . Snow rumbled softly off the curved roof , burying the Jamesway to nearly half its height . Precisely at eleven , the generator was shut down and the light went out . He fell into an agitated sleep in which Karen appeared , and he held her , and she clung to him , and both yielded to t he fever that possessed them . He woke to the sounds of the dying stove . The flame leaped and flickered ; through the space along the rim of the lid he saw its gasping dance . It died , and the cold invaded the hut , and he fell finally into a helpless sleep . A moment before he slid into darkness he realized he would be unable to light the stove in the morning ; fire was forbidden him on his Sabbath . That was a moment of deepest despair , that final flickering moment of consciousness . He was awakened by distant scraping sounds . He opened his eyes . Faint light filtered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the Jamesway ; it was repeated a number of times . ' ( hen someone knocked on his door . He rose into the cold and went to the door and stood aside as he pulled it open . He saw Roger and the Korean houseboy . They came quickly inside . Gershon stared at them . They were red with cold and flecked with snow . They smiled . They had dug him out , Roger said . He had remembered about the Jewish faith and fire on the Sabbath , he said .  | He and Sammy Kim had dug him out and broken the ice in the line . Did he have the chaplain 's permission to light the stove ? Sammy Kim would warm some water . Was the chaplain all right ? Everything was buried in almost twenty inches of snow . The entire division , paralyzed . Sammy Kim smiled timidly , puttered about in silence . Gershon looked at Roger Tat and Sammy Kim as they moved about the Jamesway . Roger 's shell-rimmed glasses were wet . With his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the flow of oil . The houseboy  --  short , thin , lithe , yellow-brown skin , high cheekbones , dark slanted eyes ; about fourteen years of age ? glanced shyly at Gershon . " Okay , chaplain , sah ? " He put the heated basin of water on the stand . " Thank you , " Gershon said . He looked at them and saw them . The fire leaped , danced , whirled , a long yellow curling tongue of flame . The air grew warm . They left . Gershon dressed and washed and prayed the Shabbat service . He gazed at the light in the stove . In the weeks that followed he made a number of choices . This was during the period of time when in the outside world Eisenhower decided to run again for the presidency , Syrian anti-aircraft fire brought down an Israeli plane , a cold wave in Europe killed 919 people , four Swedish jets flew into a hill , and New York City was buried in a monstrous blizzard . He worried about his aunt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices he made . He informed the division chaplain that he intended to keep Roger Tat as his assistant . He set up a schedule of services for the infantry regiment above the thirty-eighth parallel and traveled by jeep with chains on the tires and a weapon on the floor next to Roger . The roads were heavy with traffic , and alongside the roads , across the shallow river they forded to avoid the frozen mountain passes , were the mud and straw houses of prostitutes , smoke pouring from the chimneys and jeeps parked at the doors . In the middle of April , about two weeks after Passover , the Seoul Jewish chaplain went home . " Untouched , " he said exultantly to Gershon . " God was good to me . Now you can request to be moved to Seoul . They will do it . Let the man who replaces me be assigned to division . "  | But Gershon made no such request . He did not know why he decided to remain in the battalion . The warming sense of security and satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly battalion commander ? The few doctors he was getting to know and the work he was doing ? But all that could not entirely explain why he chose to remain . Simply , he did not know . His footlockers arrived with his books . He was given a wide new bed and a new bureau . His bookcase looked fine with the books neatly lined up on the shelves . No Arthur Leiden here in this broken land to poke in his books  --  Arthur Leiden , suave , swaggering , polished , a navy uniform , a posh officers club , high talk . Gershon 's schedule of services in the battalion chapel was fixed . The snows ended . Roger functioned smoothly , often anticipating Gershon 's wishes . Gershon admired his assistant 's cheerful gentleness and the quiet tenacity of his faith ; once he even tried reading The Book of ? Mormon but found it nearly incomprehensible . Gabriel Rosen attended services . He sat always in the same front pew , praying devotedly , in white-faced gloom . He drank the wine . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapel . In late April Gershon went to the division PX , purchased a phonograph and a number of classical and popular records . He took to listening to music in the late evenings after dinner . The officers club , with its new wall paneling and card tables and floor lamps and bar stools , was always crowded at night and often noisy , and he did not stay around too long . Sometimes , alone in the hut with the music , he thought of Karen and Arthur . He had no more visions . In the first week of May the altar chairs arrived , and three days later came the pews . He went alone through the chapel early the next morning . He saw its beauty , the clean and shining lights on the pews , altar , chairs , lectern , lights from the sun that streamed in through the open windows  --  and he liked what he saw . After a long moment he went to the office and wrote a memo to the battalion commander . He wondered why he had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memo and walked it through to battalion headquarters . Three days later four men drove up to the chapel in a jeep . They removed the crosses , placed a weather vane on the steeple and a  | new panel of stained wood next to the entrance door . The weather vane was of dark metal that became quickly clogged with airborne grit and ceased to turn with the wind . The new panel was stained too dark and did not quite match the others . The division chaplain rode up one day , looked at the chapel , and rode away . It was the third week of May . Dust clouds climbed into the pale sky from the traffic on the dry roads . The dust yellowed Gershon 's face as he was driven about in the jeep ; it powdered the tents and Jamesways and hospital Quonsets on the compound . Sammy Kim was suddenly gone a few days , then returned . Gershon learned that his mother had died and was buried on the shoulder of the hill behind the battalion . He had watched her being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day he had gazed out the window and spotted a procession moving along the shoulder of the hill that lay beyond the rear perimeter fence of the battalion . White-garbed elderly men in stovepipe hats ; women ; younger men ; a long box on a plank carried by some of the men . He saw the procession stop and the box lowered into the ground and the grave filled . They went back down the hill , leaving behind a bare unmarked mound of new earth . The next day , on the way up to the northern regiment in the jeep , he saw a similar procession on the road near the river . " A funeral , " Roger said . They passed it quickly , sending up swirls of dust . Did the living worship the dead in this country ? Gershon knew nothing about these people , had little desire to know . They entered the dry riverbed  --  sandy bottom and smooth pebbles and shallow streamlets and sunlight glinting on the clear , slow-moving water ? and came out near the house of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a low mud house with a thatched roof and a front yard marked with bamboo poles . She stood in the doorway , a pretty girl with dark hair and a red skirt and red lips and dark eyes . She waved as they went by . Her breasts , full and pendulous , were clearly visible . Gershon felt the heat rise in his belly . Roger looked away . They remained overnight at the regiment and drove back in the morning , and there she was again in the doorway  | of the house , waving at them , the tips of her bare breasts brown in the sunlight . The next day they drove to Seoul , the day after to I Corps , and the day after that to the infantry division in the mountains near Panmunjom , where the armistice had been signed during his disastrous summer as a camp counselor . How long ago had that been ? he thought , gazing across valleys and hills at the nearby enemy who no doubt stood gazing back at him . There were millions of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew why he was here looking at them . Everywhere in the brush he imagined he saw enemy eyes ; behind boulders in the hills , everywhere . He and Roger rode back through the odorous shanty towns and blasted villages , half-naked children everywhere and stone-faced adults , all looking ravaged and hungry . He felt himself a vile intruder . He stared at much and saw little . They would drive in silence for lengthy stretches of time , Roger intent upon the road . The dust of the land blew into the jeep . Gershon wondered if village air bore diseases he might contract merely through travel . He had to travel . He was the only Jewish chaplain in Korea . There was some trouble about finding another man . No one told him what the trouble was ; no one seemed to know . Sometimes he traveled by plane . The L-19 's were light , fast , twoseater aircraft . You sat behind the pilot strapped into a parachute , the seat a form of entombment , and the aircraft bounced and yawed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no faith it could be landed safely  --  too much gusting air , too many towering hills , too fragile a machine , that one propeller , that thin fabric of papery metal . Sometimes he saw from the air a rash of pinkish glows in the shrub-covered hills and the curling rise of gray smoke . There were frequent fires in the hills , set by the Koreans , and no one seemed to know the reason for them . " It 's to kill the rats , " a pilot said . " They 're getting rid of the weeds that cause hemorrhagic fever , " the battalion commander said . Others offered other reasons but no one really knew . The winds blew through the fires , and he wondered what would happen if he ever crashed into one of the burning hills . Light aircraft seemed always to be crashing . An L-2o Beaver went down near Seoul in March : one man was killed , three  | were injured . A division L-i9 crashed into a rice paddy after takeoff one April day , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent him off to a rear hospital . Gershon came away from those rides drained , with a shivery weakness in his knees and always needing to use the piss tubes . One afternoon Roger met him with the jeep at the division airstrip after a three-hour flight from Pusan . There were clouds blowing across the tops of the hills . The first drops of rain came as they turned into the battalion compound . By dinner the rain was heavy . He ate and watched the rain pelt the grave on the hill . Later in his Jamesway he sat reading and listening to a Brandenburg Concerto and heard the rain on the canvas roof . The air was warm and damp . It rained through the night , and in the morning it was a wall of water pouring endlessly from a slate-dark sky , and he realized the monsoon season had begun . And now he traveled on roads that were often slippery rivers of mud . The battalion commander said to him one evening , " How 's it going , chappy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you feeling all right ? " " Yes , sir . I 'm really fine . " " All that traveling around . They ought to get another man . Ca n't be all over the peninsula . It 's a scandal . Must be careful . " " He 's becoming more and more spiritual , " one of the doctors at the table said . " Ca n't you see it ? " " No one becomes more spiritual in this place , " said a second doctor . " Not even chaplains . Is n't that right , chaplain ? " " You ought to start eating meat , " the battalion commander said . " It 's bad for you to be losing all that weight . Bad . " " They 'll send you home in a pine box , chaplain , " the first doctor said . " This place has diseases we do n't even have names for yet . The tuberculosis here alone could have killed off the dinosaurs . " " Why do n't you make a blessing over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Ca n't you do that ? " " If I could make a blessing and call it chicken , I 'd make a blessing and call it steak , " Gershon said . They laughed and let up on him , and he finished his food with  | neither interest nor appetite . He was rarely hungry . The canned kosher meats his uncle sent him by boat mail were inadequate and inedible . He ate eggs and bread and often vegetables and cereals and was but had yet to be ill . Sometimes he would find himself alone at a table , and he would eat quickly . Often during those times he would become aware that he was looking out the window across the perimeter fence at the solitary grave on the hill . Why was that distant mound so singular an attraction ? It lay facing southward on the bare wide sloping shoulder of the hill , with ridges stretching along the east and west and with the long length of the valley at its feet . " Was your mother old ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sah , " Sammy Kim said , looking past him . " Not old . " " Was she sick ? " " Yes , sah . Sick . Taksan sick . She die . " And he turned his head away and bent down over the boots he was polishing . " You live with your father ? " " Yes , sah . Abuji . Yes , sah . In little village other side of hill . No can see from here . Very little . Very old village . Yes , sah . " " Do you pray to your mother ? " " Pray , sah ? " " Do you talk to her , ask her for things ? " " Yes , sah . Oh yes . Amuni watch all the time from hill . All the time . Yes . " Yes . The word echoed . Yes . " Amuni do for us good things , " the boy said . " Happy things . Amuni have nice place and see cu-cak . Amuni see all to south from bright place , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where did you learn your English , Sammy ? From soldiers ? " " Yes , sah . American soldiers , sah . Know good English , speak many words . I talk good , sah ? " " Yes , " Gershon said , and looked at the small lithe form bent over his boots and polishing them to a high shine . Outside the rain fell steadily . White mold had formed in some of his books , and now twice a week the boy took the books from the shelves , riffled the pages , and replaced them neatly in their straight lines . The grave on the hill seemed unaffected by the rains , and Gershon wondered  | about that until one morning when he saw a man on the hill rebuilding the mound after a punishing rain . The man was brownskinned and muscular , and when he was done he stepped back and looked a long time at the grave and turned and went down the far side of the hill . There were days he did not travel . He worked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance lectures , answered his mail , sent off memos , made out reports . One morning a request came up from the office of the Eighth Army chaplain for photographs of the interior and exterior of the chapel . He sent a letter of request to the division signal officer for the photographs , explaining that the request was being sent by letter rather than by a DA i1-161 form because the forms were unavailable within the battalion . That was one of the many things that could not be obtained in adequate amounts , or could not be had at all . There were shortages of boots , ordnance , jeep and ambulance spare parts , tank spare parts , fresh vegetables , greens for salads , fish . Beer and liquor were plentiful . Sergeants who were on their second tour of duty told him they longed for war , supplies flowed in war , what you really needed you could swap for or steal with ease . This twilight armistice , this no-war and no-peace , was a special hell of paperwork , boredom , low morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of this he had somehow completed the chapel , and wherever he traveled now they had heard of the chapel and cheered him for it . There was a story on the chapel in Stars and Stripes . He rode down to Seoul to tape a radio broadcast on the meaning of the Festival of Shavuot , and was introduced as " the chaplain of the well-known medical battalion chapel . " As often as he could he sat alone in a front pew , in silence , and gazed at the altar and the lights . Its interior was clean and white , the wood glistening , the cloths velvety . Once he thought he saw sitting there the old man with the beard who had once taught him Aramaic and given him the kabbalistic amulet he wore together with his dog tags ; but it was too brief and shimmering a vision and he could not be certain he had in fact seen him . He walked into the chapel one morning and found Roger sitting there alone in the second row . Roger started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I did n't mean to disturb you , Roger . " " I was thinking I had only two more months here , sir . I was thinking of my family . " His voice was soft and his myopic eyes swam behind the lenses . " Two months . I was thinking how hard it is to believe that . " " I 've got twelve months . It 's hard to believe that too . " Roger smiled sadly . " You 'll make it , sir . " " The doctors do n't think so . They think I 'll disappear before the end of the summer . I will be a vanished wraith . " " How were the tests , sir ? " " All negative . " " You should eat , sir . You do n't eat . " " If the doctors here told you that you should drink tea and coffee , would you do it , Roger ? " " I think I would write home and ask what to do , sir . " " You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh no , sir .. We do n't do that sort of thing . We 're not primitive , sir . " Right . Yes . Well . As soon as you can , Roger , come into the office . There are some memos we need to get out . " They drove into Seoul in the early afternoon for a routine meeting with the assistant who was responsible for the maintenance of the Jewish chapel . It was a searing , dusty day ; there had been no rain for nearly forty-eight hours . Farmers worked the rice paddies . The human excrement spread on the fields for fertilizer thickened and fouled the air . They were going through Seoul on their way back to the battalion , and at an intersection a runaway horse attached to a riderless cart came plunging toward them . They were nearly through the intersection , and Gershon did not see it , and then it was upon them , filling all his vision , suddenly , a dark-brown wall of motion , and Roger pulled on the wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershon saw its blood-streaked eyes and the white foam on its mouth , and he felt its heat , felt the heat of the horse hotter than the heat of the day , a palpable heat against his face , and it was gone , the cart clattering crazily behind it . Only when they were out of the city did he become calm enough to realize clearly that a collision with that crazed horse might have killed them both . And he began to tremble .  | " You 're a damn good driver , " he murmured . " Thank you , sir . " Roger 's soft voice shook . " No . Thank you . " " The heat must have made the horse go crazy . The heat and the dust . It 's awful . " " How ridiculous . I mean the idea of being killed in Korea by a crazy horse . How absolutely ridiculous ! " The dust and heat blew against his face , but he could not stop trembling . He had once seen a horse in his neighborhood drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front wheels . The iceman kicked it , then began to call to it endearingly . " Charlie , " he called . " What 're you doing ? What ? Get up . It 's too hot here . Charlie . Get up . Extra bucket of oats if you get up . Come on , Charlie . Hey . Hey ! Oh , my dear Charlie is gone ! " Who collected the dead horses ? Had the dead horses of the New York Fire Department ever run into moving automobiles ? How ridiculous ! Why had he thought of that monument now ? And he thought too of Karen and Jakob Keter and the walks along Riverside Drive . They rode the rest of the way to the battalion in silence . It rained early Saturday morning , then cleared and turned hot and rained again briefly in the afternoon . Sunday they followed the valley north along the main supply route , crossed a low range of hills , and came down onto a broad plain . Terraced fields climbed into the hills . Children played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth before a peasant hut . Men were removing fertilizer from a horse-drawn cart . A scrawny dog lay asleep in the sun by the side of the road . Women in baggy pants were doing laundry near a rushing stream ; they turned to stare briefly at the jeep as it went by . It was a clear day , the air still cool with morning . The riverbed stretched dry in the sunlight , and they started across it , the pebbles crunching beneath the tires . In the heart of the riverbed was a trickle of water , and he heard the sounds of the water and the pebbles . There was the briefest of moments as he sat in the jeep with eyes closed , feeling the warm morning sunlight on his eyes and the cool morning air on his face and the gentle lurchings of the jeep in the riverbed  --  when all that Korean world vanished , and he imagined himself in some distant sunny land of gentle valleys and kind hills  | bathed in the softest and most caressing of lights . The noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . They were hubcap deep in water . Ahead as far as he could see was a boiling torrent of water , and they were in it , and it was stretched out all behind them and alongside them . They bounced and lurched , and the water rose . Roger shifted expertly into four-wheel drive and put his foot down hard on the pedal , and the engine whined . There was water on the floorboard and water came pouring into the sides of the jeep . Gershon stared at the water and raised his feet and stared at Roger 's feet buried now deep in the water on the floor of the jeep . He heard the rush and the roar of the cascading river and the whine of the struggling jeep and saw the wheel jerking in Roger 's hands , saw Roger 's face set , intent , his eyes narrowed to slits behind the glasses . The water ceased rising , and they were in it a long time . And then they were out of it , the water falling away , the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea amphibian . Roger shifted back into drive and continued on . Dust rose behind them . The hills were green and violet and streaked with yellow flowers . The prostitute stood in the doorway of her hut , breasts bare to sun and sight . Roger looked away . " It was yesterday 's rain , sir , " he said after a long time . " Are you all right ? " Gershon said . " Should n't you dry your feet ? " " I do n't want to stop , sir . I may not be able to get it started again . I was frightened , sir . We 'll take the mountain road back . " When they returned to battalion late that afternoon they learned that a jeep had attempted to ford the river some miles above them and had foundered and been swept away by the force of the water . The driver had made it to the shore . The captain was still missing . Two days later they found his body , miles away , near the steel bridge that crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All week after that river ride , Gershon slept badly for the dreams that filled his head . Re retreated to his books and " music . He , lost himself in Bach and kabbalistic numerology . Safe , safe And- calm . The flow of music , the weave of numbers and words : He read and reread the letters from his aunt and uncle and from Karen . He had heard nothing from Jakob Keter . It seemed to him that random events now sought to control their lives . Strange things were hap-  | pening everywhere , deadly things . Anti-personnel mines planted during the war and long dormant were moving beneath the ground in the drenched and shifting earth , and people who always walked with great care , placing their feet on tested patches of land , now trod on earth that blew them to pieces . Officers went hunting in the hills and stepped on the mines . Enlisted men were blown up near the huts of whores . One day a child was brought to the battalion , a girl , with an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was-no-war , but people kept crashing into shards of the world that broke their lives . He tried not to think about it too often . He spent as much time as he could in his Jamesway with his records and books and letters ; and much time in the chapel with its sunlight and silence . Then Sammy Kim was gone a few days , and Gershon found he missed the boy 's timid presence . He asked around ; no one knew where he was . The boy returned with bruises on his face and arms . Gershon asked one of the doctors to look at him . " Some kids beat him up , " the doctor said over lunch . " He would n't kick in protection money . They did a good job on him , the bastards . " " Korean kids beat him ? " " Why not ? You think only Americans bang on each other ? It 's a great world out here . All join in the fun . " Gershon looked out the window at the hill . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn slicky boys . Feed on us . Feed on kids . Why not ? Talking about feeding . Listen , chaplain . You really ought to start eating meat . " " Tell him , doc , " the battalion commander put in from the adjoining table . " He does n't listen to me . Tell him . " The doctor , who was the division psychiatrist and had the rank of captain , said , " Your religion is n't one of those that says get sick and die , is it ? It 's not one of those kinds of religion . " " Are you telling me as a doctor that I really might get seriously sick ? " " Go ahead , doc . Tell him . " The major looked at Gershon and smiled paternalistically . " It'snot.a good . idea play around with your health this place , l  | chaplain . You can get beat up . Right now my dog back home eats better than you do . What 's the point to getting beat up ? All concur it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat good these next weeks , " the major said around the cigarette he was lighting . " Listen to the doc . Do n't get beat up . Very bad idea . " " I 'll think about it , " Gershon said . " Seriously . " " You 're a stubborn man , chappy , " the battalion commander said . " You 're good for the morale of my boys . " " Why do you suppose that 's the only one on the hill ? " Gershon said . " What ? " the battalion commander said . " The grave on that hill . " " What grave ? " He looked to where Gershon pointed . " I 'll be damned , " he said . " This is the first time I noticed it . " He stared out the window and puckered his small lips . " I wonder whose headache that 's going to be . Where are you off to today , chappy ? " " Artillery . " " Have a good trip . Stay out of riverbeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , " the captain said . " All concur ? " " Right , " the battalion commander said . In the second week of June , Gershon flew to Japan . He took a train to the town of Oiso , which lay on the Pacific coast about forty miles south of Tokyo . The weather was warm , the sky a clear sparkling blue . He felt exhilarated by the newness of the land , by the bursts of color from flowers and clothes , the lush green of the hills , the neat narrow lanes of villages swiftly glimpsed , and once , the train slowing for some reason , he saw a geisha framed in his window on the corner of a street , and her fragile balance of face and garb was of such transcendent beauty that he felt as if struck , and he heard the breath leave his lungs in a long sigh of pleasure . For three days , at the invitation of the Japan-based Jewish chaplain , he participated in a Jewish religious retreat , lecturing to around eighty men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | that was an army retreat center . In the company of others , he walked along the sand beaches and through the tiny seaside town . They stood in a crowd one afternoon and saw costumed men carrying a large pagodalike edifice on poles and dancing with it , dancing and singing  --  and he thought of Simchat Torah and Jews dancing with Torah scrolls . It was a gay and festive afternoon , and there were many children , and women nursed infants , and the people and the streets were festooned with a shimmering array of colors . He spent the night in Tokyo , where he had a fish dinner in a lovely tatamifloored Japanese restaurant and then walked the crowded , brightly lighted streets . He wore the sport jacket , slacks , shirt , and tie he had purchased the first day of his arrival in Japan . He had a drink in a club and danced for a while with one of the Japanese girls . At first she did not understand what a chaplain was . He flew back to the battalion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess the first morning he was back , and by noon it was one hundred and three . His head was filled with pictures of his time in Japan  --  visions played themselves out repeatedly before his eyes  --  and he gave little attention during the next few days to what was happening around him in the battalion . Repeatedly he saw the geisha on the street and felt against him the warm and soft body of the girl in the club . There had been a small band and dim smoky lights and the drinks and the girl against him , long straight dark hair and narrow dark eyes and high cheekbones and her flesh moist beneath his hands as they danced slowly on the crowded floor . He sat sweating in the chapel office and worked with Roger on his accumulated mail . He traveled by aircraft and jeep to Seoul , Pusan , Uijongbu , to I Corps and the distant division near Panmunjom , to the regiment in the north , and again to Seoul . He sweated and showered and ate and traveled and lay awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why he was no longer seeing visions of Arthur and his parents , of Einstein and Truman . He remembered a vague sensation he had experienced while watching the religious parade and festival in Oiso : heat and fire and smoke and burning flesh  --  a sudden quick , swiftly gone filter of darkness across the color-splashed joy of that afternoon . He saw and did not see what was changing in  | the battalion . He knew they were preparing to move to the hill , had known for some weeks , as had everyone else . They would build a new compound and a new hospital to be away from the dust of the main supply route , and the chapel would be moved and rebuilt and enlarged  --  on the highest point along the shoulder of that hill . It was one of the things he had known and not known , and he had paid it scant heed since his return from Japan . Now in Korea , about a week after his return , it rained six days straight , and the battalion compound became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were grounded in the pummeling rain , roads were washed away . He looked up one day from a meal of vegetables and saw the hill and realized that the grave was gone . He thought it had been flattened by the rains , but after two days of sun and furnace heat no one had come to repair the mound , and he knew it had been moved . He said to his houseboy that afternoon , " Where is your mother now , Sammy ? " " Ah , " the boy said , squeezing his thin shoulders together and not looking at Gershon . His small face was pinched , wooden . " Where ? Tell me . " " Not a good place , sah . Move . Not a sparrow place . Not see cu-cak . Soldiers tell to move , sah . We go to hill ? " " Yes . " " Bad for amuni , sah . Bad for abuji . Bad for village . Oh , bad . " " What do you mean ? " " Bad people come to village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make money from Americans . Oh , bad , bad . " He said to Roger the next morning , " They had to move the grave to make way for the battalion . Did you know that ? " " What grave , sir ? " " The grave of Sammy Kim 's mother . " " Is that right ? I did n't know her grave was there . " " It was on the hill . Yes . " Roger was silent , gazing myopically off into space through his glasses . " What a hell of a thing , " Gershon said . " To have to move your mother 's grave . "  | " You know , sir , " Roger said , " I was thinking we might live in California after we 're married . Central California . I could go to school and get my degree in musicology . My folks could come and visit . It 's not so far from Utah . I hear nice things about California , sir . Gershon stared at him . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Four weeks . I ca n't think of anything else . Should n't we be getting you a new assistant ? " " Yes , " Gershon said . " Right . " During lunch he said to the battalion commander , " Are those our men on the hill ? " The major narrowed his eyes and looked through the window . " They better be , " he said , " or I 'm going to chew some ass ' " I do n't see any machinery . " " We wo n't get any , chappy . The engineers need it for the roads and bridges . " " And the new officers clubs , " one of the doctors said . " Do n't forget the officers clubs . " " Are we going to cut the drainage channels in that hill by ourselves ? " another of the doctors asked . " That 's the idea , doc . " " With our medics ? You 're kidding ! " " Those are my orders , doc , and that 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major . All agree . Not smart . " " You want to come up with me , chappy , and have a look ? Be good for the men to see you there . Going up at fourteen hundred hours . Boost the morale . " They rode together in the major 's jeep . After passing the battalion guardpost , they made a right turn onto the main supply route and rode a few hundred feet and turned right again and went up a dirt road that was suddenly wide and steep and led out onto a broad slightly sloping ridge that was the shoulder of the hill behind the battalion . The wind blew hot , but there was no dust . They could see across the battalion and the valley to a distant range of southern hills . A yellowish haze hung over the valley . There were battalion trucks and jeeps on the hill and men with shovels digging the  | drainage ditches against the next rains . The view across the valley was sweeping . Gershon had not thought the shoulder to be so high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officers mess . He wondered if the sky could be seen from here at night . Did the obscuring dust clouds rise ? Were the stars visible ? He walked alongside the major , greeting and chatting with the men . They worked stripped to the waist in the relentless beating heat . The concrete platforms for the buildings were to be poured in early August . If the drainage work was n't completed all would be swept away by rains . Gershon looked slowly around at the broad slope of the hill , feeling the sting of the sun through his dark pilot 's glasses and wondering how they would ever do that without heavy ditch-digging equipment . They had climbed to the rim of the future compound , its northern perimeter . From there the shoulder and the battalion and the division and the airstrip and all the faded green and dusty valley lay before him  --  a weary and mottled expanse of troubled earth . Behind him , at the foot of a steep , brush-covered hillside , he saw a tiny village of about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terraced fields . Oxen grazed in the grass . Men worked in the fields . Children played in the shade of the huts . There was the distant barking of a dog . " Here we put the chapel , " said the major . " Right here . Facing the valley . Nice ? Make up a little for all the bombs . Telling you this here and now , chaplain . Private . It was war , and it had to be done . But I did n't like it . Swore I 'd get out of it . Could n't look down . You know what I mean ? " They walked back down the slope past the lines of laboring men . An officer came over to them and saluted . " How 's it going , lieutenant ? " " Hot , sir . Worried about sunstroke . " " Salt tablets , lieutenant . Salt tablets . And water . " " Yes , sir . " They drove back along the dusty road to the battalion . Two days later Gershon  --  a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan . He was in Japan ten days . With a Jewish lieutenant he had met at battalion services , he traveled to  | Kyoto , Nara , Takarazuka , and Kamikeo . He was stunned into speechlessness by the temple beauty of Kyoto . They took a flatbottomed boat along with other Japanese and an Australian widow in her early fifties and they traveled along the Hatzu River through mountain gorges and shot the rapids and , in the silences , listened to the singing of nightingales echo back and forth among the cedars and pines that lined the tall cliffs along the banks . They took the train back to Tokyo and rode along the ocean . Gershon looked and saw the awesome rise of Mount Fuji , vast and wide and filling all the train window and the far sky . He spent that night in the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo and the next night in Camp Drake . He flew back to Korea and arrived at the battalion in a rainstorm . From the window of the officers mess he watched a river of rain wash across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The channels dug by the men flooded and collapsed . Day after day of rain followed . The work on the hill ceased . The men began to grumble . There were fights in the tents and a sudden sharp rise in the battalion 's venereal disease rate . Gershon walked the compound and saw the men tired , angry . Why were n't the engineers building the new compound ? Why were medics digging ditches ? Where was the engineer ditch-digging equipment ? Was n't there anything the battalion could trade for that equipment ? Then the noncoms were angry , and as Gershon wandered the compound they talked to him . Ditch-digging equipment had been seen parked in the nearby engineer compound ; other diggers were working over at regiment , at division headquarters , on the main supply route . Why everyone else and not us , chaplain ? The battalion commander grew somber . " You wo n't get it done without engineers , Doug , " one of the company commanders said over breakfast one morning . " Ca n't get engineers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Out of the question . Ca n't budge the G-4 . " " Why ? " " Do n't know . He does n't have to explain himself to me. "  | " It wo n't get done , Doug . " They stared out the window at the rain on the hill . On a rainy morning Gershon and Roger stood in the chapel office . " I want to thank you , sir , " Roger said . " I appreciate all you did for me . " " Good luck to you , Roger . " " I appreciate your keeping me on , sir . I know it was  --  awkward . " " Take care of yourself . Write the world some good music . " " Yes , sir . " Roger saluted , Gershon returned the salute . They shook hands . " Have a safe trip , Roger , " Gabriel Rosen said . He was standing near Roger 's desk . " Thank you , Gabriel . " Roger went out the door into the rain . Gershon sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see it . The air was steaming ; it had the odor of fungus and drowned earth . He saw Gabriel Rosen sit in Roger 's chair . Rain fell on the roof in a ceaseless drumming torrent . " Is there anything we have to do , rabbi ? " Gabriel asked after a while . Gershon said nothing . " Rabbi ? " " There 's always something to do . Listen . Please do n't call me rabbi . Call me either sir or chaplain . Okay ? " Gabriel 's dark eyes flashed surprise against the papery whiteness of his face . " This is n't Brooklyn , Gabriel . This is n't Borough Park . " " Yes , sir . " " Find something to do . There 's plenty to do . I 'm going out for a cup of coffee . " Later the rain ended , and the clouds broke . A fierce sun shone suddenly from a pale-blue sky , and the earth began to dry . When he entered the officers mess for lunch he noticed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee he saw that the work had resumed on the hill . In the afternoon the heat rose to one hundred fourteen degrees . One of the medics on the hill passed out and was brought to the hospital .  | Gabriel said to Gershon the next morning , " There 's a lot of complaining going on , sir . " " I hear . " " The men do n't want to dig di . ? - . .. get machines to do the ditches .. T-he. - on. ? - who. passed out yesterday  --  he had sunstroke . It was bad . " At dinner that day the battalion commander said to Gershon , " You want to ride up to the hill with me tomorrow , chappy ? " " Tomorrow 's my Sabbath , sir . I do n't ride on my Sabbath . " " Oh . Yes . Right . Right . Sunday , then . " " Yes , sir . " " Afternoon . Go up and boost the morale . Becoming a problem . You hearing anything ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , sir . " ++ o One ditch-digger . One machine . Ca n't pry it loose from engineers . Do n't know anyone , and they do n't owe us anything . They keep their pants on . Pure , the engineers . " On Sunday afternoon Gershon rode up to the hill with the battalion commander . They left the jeep at the foot of the hill and walked to the crest . The sloping shoulder was entirely without shade . Gershon felt his heart racing and sweat on his face and neck . On the other side of the hill the tiny village seemed asleep . He had never known such heat ; the air seemed aflame . Standing next to the major , Gershon saw a man stumble into a ditch . He had a clear momentary view of the man 's eyes as he fell , wide and all white , the pupils gone up beneath the lids . A cluster of men formed quickly around him . On the shoulder , not far from where the grave had once been , stood an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen the second man fall . The ambulance started downhill toward the road and the battalion . A lieutenant came running toward them up the hill . He saluted . His uniform was stained with sweat . " That 's the third and fourth today , sir . " Gershon gazed down the hill . He could see the men leaning on  | their shovels . They were all looking up at him and the major , and waiting . " What do you think , chappy ? " the major said . Gershon looked at the men waiting in the sun and heat . They all seemed enveloped in flames . " I do n't know how much more of this we can do , sir , " said the lieutenant . " It 's over a hundred degrees up here . " " Is n't there someone at division we can meet with and talk to about this ? " Gershon asked . He did not know what else to say . The major stared down the hill at the waiting men . Beyond the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds of vehicular traffic . An L-19 rose from the runway and flew on straight south , leaving behind no sound . " Damn good idea , " said the major . " Have a meeting with the G-4 . Get the division surgeon in on it , and chief of staff . Clear it up . Good idea . You come along and make a morale report . Right ? " " Yes , sir . " " Get the men back to the battalion , lieutenant . Do n't want anyone else hurt unnecessarily . " " Yes , sir . " " Damn good idea , chappy . I owe you a drink . Let 's get into some shade . Brain beginning to boil . " The division psychiatrist said to Gershon that evening , " Clever idea , chaplain . All agree . Clear the air . " " Damn right , " said the battalion commander . " Smart chaplain . " Gershon was finding it bewildering that so simple a suggestion was eliciting so enthusiastic a response . He saw the major talking excitedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely spoke and never drank . " Couple of days , Doug , " the adjutant said . " If they go for it . " Some sort of machinery was being set into motion as a result of his offhand suggestion . He could not understand what he had done . " Tuesday , maybe Wednesday , " the adjutant was saying . " At the latest Thursday . Frank will be there . " " Have another beer , chaplain , " said the major . All were drinking beer that evening . The ice for their drinks had been used earlier to pack the sunstroke victims . The entire division had been scoured for ice .  | Gabriel said to him the next morning , " Everyone 's talking about it , chaplain , sir . You 're a hero . They asked me to tell you . " " We 've got to go to Seoul today . " " In this heat ? " Gershon looked at him . " Yes , sir , " Gabriel said . " I 'll get the jeep . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode to Seoul . Much of the way they were behind a convoy of two-and-a-half-ton trucks . The ride took nearly two hours . Gershon spent half an hour with the Eighth Army chaplain on preliminary plans for the High Holiday services in September . " Do n't know what 's going on , " he said to Gershon . " They had a man , something went wrong . New man is coming around the end of August or early September . Do n't have a name , no . You 're sure you do n't want to transfer to Seoul ? All right . We 'll put the new man into Seoul . Nice Jewish chapel here . I ca n't leave it too long without a chaplain . Not enough to have an assistant running it . You 're sure you do n't want a transfer ? " He arrived back in division in time for dinner . On the wall near the door of the officers club the thermometer registered eighty-six degrees . The odor of cooked ham assailed his throat . He saw the major wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , fourteen hundred hours . I owe you a drink . " The major shaped his small lips into a smile . " G-4 , chief of staff , division surgeon , you , me , John here . Anyone else , John ? " " That 's the lot , Doug , " said the adjutant . Damn big meeting . We 're counting on you , chappy . " He slipped into a chair and ate bread and vegetables and drank coffee . He smoked the cigarette offered him by one of the company commanders and joined the major at the bar . Some time later he came out of the officers club into the hot night . The air lay heavy and without movement . An occasional jeep and truck passed along the main supply route , headlights flaring obliquely through the darkness . A red light blinked on and off atop a tall tower somewhere in the vicinity of the landing strip . Helmeted guards walked the perimeter , checking the fence for breaks by slicky boys , the South Korean thieves who moved skil-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quonset of the Headquarters and Headquarters Company , past the barbershop run by the old Korean with the wispy white beard and the gnarled hands who hummed and sang as he snipped and cut , past the Hong Kong tailor shop and the Quonset that housed the offices of the major and his adjutant and their noncoms and clerks . Even in the starless darkness of the steamy night the hills stood clearly against the sky , blacker than the night , and the chapel carved its sharp silhouette out of its background of hospital buildings . And even in the darkness he saw the bleak , slovenly , scraped and battered walls of the battalion buildings , dusty , begrimed , and he smelled in the sultry air the stench of the fertilizer on the fields and the strong sour odor of the kimchi , the fermented cabbage that was the national food . Only the chapel stood clean and white on the compound . There was a stirring in the area of the tents beyond the hospital . Were they bringing in the prostitutes even on so hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men lined up for the whores brought in by some of the noncoms from the village beyond the landing strip and the Korean market . What did they want from him , the major and the adjutant and the doctor ? He was a Jewish chaplain ; how had he become caught up in this ? And yet he felt pride in his involvement ; he was a part of them . He had managed in ways not clear to him to gain their trust . Noncoms came to him with their lives open ; hecounseled men from cities and suburbs , farms and towns , from Texas and Maine and the Dakotas , from the ..... Ozarks , the Adirondacks , the Sierras-and somehow he was liked . Hecould not understand it , Gould not grasp it , he was liked by men whose lives he could not begin to conjure in visions . Gabriel reported what was said of hinh by the men in their tents  --  just as Roger had reported before . " You know how fast he pushed my morale leave through ? " " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of bed at eleven o'clock and talked to the sarge in the chapel with a flashlight for an hour . " " Yeah , he 's all over the place . " " Yeah , he was on the hill again today . " " Yeah , it 's the nicest chapel north of Seoul . " He had thought little about the things he had done here ; mostly he had tried to live with his books and records and letters . Yet now in this summer a clear and palpable resonance of regard  | echoed around him . Yes , he would be at that meeting and tell about the hill and the morale of the men . In ways mysterious to him others were seeing in him what he could not see in himself : a strength he knew he did not have , a certainty he knew he was far from possessing . This was his battalion . These were his men . He would talk up at that meeting . Yes . He turned and started back across the compound to his Jamesway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at the edge of the gravel bed and urinated into the angled metal tube set in the gravelcovered earth , and when he was done he turned to go to the Jamesway , and as he did , he saw , standing at his door , clearly outlined in the darkness , the tall , thin , trim figure of Jakob Keter . He stared and shivered and closed his eyes . When he opened his eyes , Keter was gone . But there remained in the space he had occupied the faintest of distant lclusteruminositiofessu a ns : : It- dim - fad pulsing pulsing bluish li o ght , like the light Gershon 's astonished eyes . He came into the Jamesway and prepared for bed , but it was a long time before he was able to sleep . They met in a small room adjoining the office of the chief of staff . The air was damp and hot . Through the screening on the open window came bright sunlight and the occasional sounds of a vehicle . They sat at a rectangular dark-wood table . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ceiling . From somewhere in the distance came the air-chops of a helicopter . Gershon , his back to the door , shifted nervously in his metal chair . An emergency in the battalion ? He saw the swirl of dust , the orderlies rushing toward the helicopter , the doctors poised . The battalion commander sat opposite him , looking unconcerned . The adjutant was silent . The chief of staff , a tall thin bird-colonel with close-cut graying hair and glasses , had the air of a kindly schoolmaster . The G-4 , a lieutenant colonel , was short and stocky ; his square face wore a dark look . The division surgeon , a portly lieutenant colonel , normally a jovial man , appeared troubled and chewed repeatedly at the fringes of his mustache with his teeth and lower lip .  | Gershon knew none of these men ; had , in fact , never seen them before . The chief of staff cleared his throat and looked around . He said , in a mild voice , " Gentlemen , I 've been told we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the problem ? Gil ? " The G-4 spoke . He would report on the hill construction project , he said . He did n't know anything about a serious problem . He had prepared a progress report . Date project had begun ; dates of expected completion of drainage , platforms , buildings . The medics were doing the drainage . The engineers would construct the platforms and buildings . He knew of no serious problems , he said . Gershon looked at the battalion commander and the adjutant . They sat very still , looking down at the table top . " Doc ? " said the chief of staff . The division surgeon sat forward in his chair , belly pressing against the edge of the table . He was prepared to report on the status of the old and new hospitals , he said . The dust problem in the old hospital had been a major factor dictating the move . The transition had been carefully planned ; the new equipment was either already in Korea or on its way ; the hospital would successfully make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew of no serious problems , he said , and at present anticipated none . He sat back in his chair . There was a brief silence . The helicopter circled the division area . Gershon saw the battalion commander and the adjutant looking down at the top of the table . " Major , what did you want this meeting for ? " the chief of staff asked . " I do n't hear a problem . " The battalion commander looked up , caught Gershon 's eye , and coughed softly . He was afraid , he said , that there was a problem . He hesitated , then continued . The use of his men to dig the drainage ditches had created something of a difficulty for the battalion , he said . The ditches were constantly being washed away by the rains ; the sun and heat had begun to take a toll ; there had been cases of sunstroke " We know about your sunstroke , major , " said the chief of staff . " We had no ice for quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Those boys were very sick , sir , " said the battalion commander . " I 'm sure they were if they had sunstroke , " said the chief of staff . " Do n't you know how to keep your men from getting sunstroke , major ? Is sunstroke your problem ? Talk to Doc . He 'll straighten you out on sunstroke . Right ? Did you call for this meeting to talk about sunstroke ? " " No , sir . There 's something more , sir . " " Yes ? What ? " " I 'm afraid we have a serious morale problem , sir . " The chief of staff looked at the battalion commander and said nothing . " The chaplain can report to you on that , sir . " The chief of staff turned to Gershon . They were all looking at him . He felt their eyes on his face , - on his insignia , on the single bar of his rank . " Go ahead , chaplain , " the chief of staff said . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sir , " Gershon heard himself say . He forced himself to look directly at the chief of staff . Easier to look away , not feel a presence , a threat , a hurt . He looked at the smooth-skinned pinkish face of the chief of staff , this man who was second in command to the general . His heart beat loudly . He had been on the hill often , he said . He had gone up on the Fourth of July and on a number of Sundays to see the men at work . There had been the normal amount of griping at first , he said , and he had joked with the men about it ? they were building a magic mountain , a hospital with a view , trading their tents for solid walls . But then the endless rains had come , , and the exhaustion - had begun to set in . Worse , a-sense of futility had developed as the men watched rain after rain destroy their work . Battalion morale had been adversely affected by the work on thehill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men at their normal hospital duties . There was growing concern over the possibility of a serious medical accident as a result of fatigue . Was it sensible to cut down on the time-off periods of the medics in order to make them ditch-diggers ? he asked . He did not want to cause trouble , he said . He understood that there were valid reasons for the way certain things had to be done , and it was  | not his wish to interfere . His responsibility was to boost the morale of his unit . He understood that . But it was also his responsibility to report to his commanding officer whenever morale was being seriously undermined . He hoped everyone understood that he was acting in what he honestly believed were the best interests of his battalion . He fell silent . His mouth was dust-dry , as if he had just returned from a jeep ride to Seoul , and his heart beat in a thick drumming rhythm . He looked away from the gaze of the chief of staff . Outside , the helicopter noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was setting down somewhere nearby . Abruptly the noise ceased . " Chaplain , with all due respect , how do you know ? " the chief of staff asked . " Sir ? " Gershon said , raising his eyes . " How do you know all this about the morale of the men ? How are you measuring it ? " " They , talk to me , sir . " " Hove do you distinguish it from normal laziness and loud grip-ing ? " " I know what goes on in their tents , sir . " " How do you know that , chaplain ? ' ' " My assistant keeps me informed . The noncoms tell me . " " I mean no disrespect , chaplain , but is your estimate of battalion morale based on the word of your assistant and some noncoms ? " " Not only , sir . " He sensed that they regarded his words as negligible abstractions drawn from the kingdom of the intangible over which he was thought to rule . How to make it real to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion 's venereal disease rate , " he said . The G-4 broke in . " For Christ 's sake , Luke ? " " All right , chaplain , " said the chief of staff , ignoring the interruption . " Let 's assume for the sake of argument that your battalion has a morale problem because it 's been ordered to dig some drainage ditches . We ca n't have engineers digging drainage ditches for every compound . An American infantry division has only one battalion of engineers . You are aware of that , chaplain , are n't you ? Fine .  | What do you recommend be done to solve your problem ? " He looked at the battalion commander and the adjutant . " Major ? " He looked at Gershon . " Chaplain ? " The adjutant gave every appearance at that moment of wishing himself invisible . The major looked down at the table top . He said , without raising his eyes , " If engineers are entirely unavailable to us " They are unavailable , major , " said the chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help . If the men could see the one machine there , sir . " The chief of staff said , " Chaplain , this is n't a haggling session at some flea market in ? " He stopped . There was a brief awkward silence . He said , " I do n't think there 's any point to ? " He stopped again . His eyes widened . Behind Gershon the door to the room had abruptly opened . The men around the table looked up and jumped to their feet with a sudden loud scraping of chairs . Gershon rose and turned and saw framed in the doorway the huge , bull-necked , baldheaded figure of the commanding general . He had seen him only once before , in a jeep , from a distance . Now , up close , he was an enormous man , well over six feet tall , long-faced , with small cold blue eyes and a protruding lower jaw . A pistol was strapped to his hip , and he carried his helmet in his hand . He was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir ? " " What the hell is going on out there ? " " Sir ? " " I just flew over the area and saw some of the men swimming in the streams . Those goddamn streams are polluted and off-limits . What the hell do we want here , typhoid and polio and bubonic plague ? " " No , sir . " " I want every major commanding officer called immediately by phone . I want those men out of those streams . " " Yes , sir . " The general 's eyes flashed scalding through the room . He stood a moment in the doorway , his eyes running across the faces of the  | men around the table . He paused over Gershon 's face . Gershon felt the cold and raging eyes , saw the eyes move to his insignia , the tablets and the Star of David . He saw the pistol and the helmet and the glistening twin stars of his power and the thick muscular frame that bulged against the meticulously neat uniform . Then the general turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in the room vibrated softly . The chief of staff , rushing out , said , " I 'll call you later , major . " The G-4 followed him from the room , brushing by Gershon without a word . The division surgeon said to the battalion commander , " You 'd better alert your guys , Doug . The shit will hit the fan if we 've got men in those streams . What a dumb-ass way to beat the heat in this place . " " That 's right , " Gershon heard himself say . " And probably they were n't even digging ditches . " The division surgeon looked at him , nodded vaguely , and went from the room . In tliejeep on the way back to the battalion the major said , " You were great in there , chappy . Very eloquent . Was n't he great , John ? " The adjutant , who had not spoken a word during the meeting , said yes , the chaplain was great . Gershon felt tired . Something about the meeting was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment , a tone of indignation . The heat and sunlight hurt his eyes . Later that afternoon he rode with Gabriel to the artillery unit in the hills across the steel bridge . He conducted a service and a discussion session and slept over . The next morning he returned to the battalion . There was no one on the hill . He was eating a lunch of scrambled eggs and coffee when the major came into the officers mess . " chappy , o-eight-hundred tomorrow on the hill . The general is coming up to look around . " Holy shit , " someone said from one of the tables . The room had fallen silent . " You 'll ride up with me . We 'll leave at o-seven-thirty hours . " " Yes , sir . "  | " Have you been in the hospital today ? " " No , sir . I just returned from artillery . " " We 've got more than a dozen men in there with high fevers . They were all in the streams . " " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their morale . " Gershon went over to the hospital , then spent the remainder of the afternoon in his office with Gabriel Rosen , working on his correspondence and his July monthly reports : number of services held , number of discussion sessions , social events after services , how many attended , number of character guidance lectures given , religious retreats , orientation lectures to incoming battalion troops , hospital visits , evaluation of the month 's activities , general comments . He wrote nothing about the battalion 's morale problem or the meeting . He would wait to see how it all turned out . He sat in his chair and gazed at the sunlight on the window . He heard Gabriel Rosen 's laborious typing and closed his eyes . He felt tired . Why was he so tired ? Probably his diet , his lack of fresh meat . He regretted having chosen Gabriel Rosen . He had yielded to his relentless importunings : he needed to be saved from the hellish job of hospital orderly ; they mocked his Jewishness , were contemptuous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been vague , the pleading leechlike and without end . Try me , try me , please , rabbi . If you do n't like me , send me back . Please I 'll have a nervousbreakdown if I stay in that hospital . Well , he did not like him  --  he was a reluctant worker , a careless driver , a slow and inept typist  --  but haw could he send him back to the hospital ? And what certainty was there that another assistant would not be worse ? He thought often of Roger Tat as he sat watching Gabriel Rosen . That night after dinner the major drank too much . Gershon sat next to him at the bar in the battalion club . The heat was intense . There was a noisy card game in progress at one of the tables . " It grabbed your ass and squeezed , " the major said . " There was no feeling like it . You put on the juice and you could feel it grabbing . I loved it . You know what I mean ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumped the bombs . You knew they were out of the belly . I did n't like looking down . Listen . Never told this  | to anyone but can tell it to you , you 're a man of integrity , deep faith . Lost my co-pilot in a dumb jeep accident on Okinawa and morale of crew went into tailspin . Very popular guy , the co-pilot . Took some flak the next time out and lost a gunner . Second time out lost an engine , barely made it . Fourth time out with new co-pilot , elevators went for mysterious reason , landed too fast , went off runway , blew up , lost two guys , was in hospital three months , quit flying . My morale all shot to hell . Know what I mean ? Loss of will . Have another drink , chaplain . Proud of you . Man of strong will , strong convictions . Admire such men . Proud . Going now ? Right . See you o-seven-thirty hours . Big day tomorrow . Big . " The night burned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his aunt and uncle and their decaying neighborhood . Houses burned in his dream ; rain poured through the cracked tar paper of rooftops . He woke and went out to the piss tubes . The morning lay bathed in the rose glow of early sunlight . Except for the perimeter guards , he seemed the only one awake on the compound . A tranquil silence covered the land , beguiling , a moment of light and airy enchantment . He dressed and prayed slowly the morning service and had a breakfast of dry cereal and milk and coffee . He rode with the major to the hill . They stood there waiting in the morning sun , all the officers of the battalion , tense , silent . Gershon waited beside the major . At two minutes to eight a dust cloud appeared on the main supply route . It moved with stunning swiftness . There was the sound of sirens . The cloud turned off the road and Gershon saw the row of jeeps racing toward them along the shoulder , dust churning , sirens abruptly silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red . The jeeps halted suddenly , clouds of dust boiling upward . About a dozen officers and military police poured from them and followed the towering man moving toward the line of battalion officers , who suddenly snapped to attention . Gershon felt his heart racing , his mouth dry . The general stood on the edge of the shoulder and surveyed the hill . He was flanked by the retinue of officers and a phalanx of military police . The general said , " Bill . "  | A captain approached with an open notebook . The general said , " I want this hill ready for buildings in two weeks . " He spoke rapidly in a low voice . " I want it graded and the drainage ditches in . I want it done by engineers . " " Yes , sir . " The captain wrote into his notebook and stepped back . The general stood there a moment longer . He turned and glanced at the battalion commander . Then he looked again at Gershon . His face was expressionless . " Major , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned and strode rapidly to his jeep . The retinue parted , dissolved , scrambled for the jeeps . Sirens cut the morning silence of the hill . The jeeps turned and roared away , followed by a rising boil of yellow dust . " We did it , " Gershon heard the major say softly in a tone of disbelief . " It was your idea , chaplain , and we won . " That afternoon two mechanical ditch-diggers were brought up to the hill . The next morning a flatbed truck moved slowly up the shoulder with a bulldozer . Gershon crossed the compound to his office and listened to the throb and roar of heavy engines . Gabriel Rosen reported to him the feelings of the men . " They told me to tell you they think you 're a great guy , sir . " " Are you ready for the trip to I Corps ? Where 's the jeep ? " " I Corps ? Again ? Did n't we just go to I Corps ? " Gershon 's houseboy , Sammy Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hill soon finished , sah ? We move ? " " Yes . " " You keep Sammy Kim , sah ? " " Sure , Sammy . " " Village not happy , sah . Bad people coming to village . Abuji say village become big , village become bad . Slicky boys come . Bad women come . Bad , sah . " Gershon said nothing . " Not your fault , sah . You soldier . You make hill build fast . Not your fault . " The boy did not look at Gershon as he spoke . At the end of the second week of August two buildings appeared on the hill . Gershon drove up to the hill with Gabriel Rosen and walked among the toiling engineers . The buildings were freshly  | painted . He saw the G-4 conferring with a captain over blueprints . " This is going to be a nice place , " Gabriel Rosen said . The G-4 glanced up , noticed Gershon , and looked back at the blueprints . Gershon returned to the hill some days later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter of the area , on the crest above the small village , two women squatted , waiting . They wore skirts and blouses , and their lips were painted bright red . He saw an engineer noncom walk over and chase them off . They went back down toward the little village , laughing . The days were still hot , but the nights had begun to turn cool . Gershon would sit at his table in the officers mess and gaze out the window at the hill . He no longer thought of the grave or the village . Building after building had come up . Paths had been marked between the buildings . The new stone-lined drainage ditches constructed by the engineers had easily contained a recent heavy rain . Soon the hospital buildings would come up and then the chapel . New , all new . He looked at the hill and felt quietly exultant . And that was the way he was feeling on the morning not long afterward when the new division chaplain walked into his office unannounced and asked if they could talk alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in Korea less than two weeks . His lean , bespectacled face wore a sober look . Quietly he declined the chair offered him by Gershon and said in his soft voice that there was really no easy way for him to do this , he had not wanted to do it by phone , so he had come in person . Gershon thought immediately of his aunt and uncle and felt the sudden surging thud of his heart . The request had come from high up , the division chaplain said in a pained tone. , Chaplain Loran was to be transferred out of the medical battalion . Gershon stared at him . The beating of his heart became a rush of noise . He heard it in his ears . " What did I do ? " " I do n't know , chaplain . " " Who requested the transfer ? "  | " They did n't tell me . It came from someone in the office of the general and was relayed by one of the majors on the staff . It troubles me greatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As soon as possible , I 'm sorry to say . " Gershon looked around . Had the sun slipped behind a sudden cloud ? When he turned back to the division chaplain he did not look at him directly ; he looked past him at the bare wall . " No one knows why ? " he asked . " They did n't tell me , chaplain . If I can help you in any way , let me know . " I can not begin to tell you how deeply this troubles me . " He went away , leaving behind him an air of apologetic and helpless regret . Gershon crossed the compound to the office of the battalion commander . " What are you talking about ? " the major said in shocked surprise . " You 're kidding . I have n't been informed of any transfer . Let me find out what 's going on . " He made some phone calls . He told Gershon at lunch , " It 's high , all right . Somewhere right around the Old Man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what 's going on . " " Do n't you , major ? " The division psychiatrist leaned over from the next table . " The gods want blood . Ca n't agree to mortal demands without exacting blood . Chaplain our sacrificial lamb . Simple . All agree ? Time-honored custom . Law of nature . Price of moral success is blood . " Gershon felt deep inside himself the fearful pain of old abandonments and the beginnings of rage .  - -  He returned to his office and was greeted by a distressed Gabriel Rosen . " I heard it . Everyone knows . What are we going to do ? " " We 're going to Seoul . " " Now ? Right now ? " " Get the jeep , Gabriel . " " Yes , sir . " They drove to Seoul in the blistering afternoon heat . No , the Eighth Army chaplain said . Gershon could not be transferred to Seoul . They had already slotted the new man into Seoul . He was a  | career man , and it would n't be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a second man coming . IIe and Gershon would cover the two line divisions . Gershon rode back to the battalion . " It is n't fair , " Gabriel Rosen said as they approached the division area . Gershon said nothing . " Will you take me with you ? " " I do n't think so , Gabriel . " " But your replacement will probably be a goy . " " Work hard and convince him to keep you . " The orders to his new unit came through the following morning . Gabriel Rosen and Sammy Kim helped him pack . It was the last week in August . Gabriel Rosen , packing Gershon 's books , said , " I did n't know you were interested in Kabbalah , rabbi . " " Watch how you handle those books , Gabriel . " " You made magic and got the engineers on the hill . " " Right . I 'll make magic and get you to disappear if you do n't stop wasting time . " " Yes , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the jeep . " Goodbye , Sammy . Take care . " " Yes , sah . Goodbye , sah . I miss you , sah . You good man , chaplain , sah . " The boy averted his eyes as he spoke . Gershon had already said his farewells to the doctors he knew and to the somber-faced major . " Ca n't understand it , " the major had said . " Bad for morale . " Now , as Gabriel drove him out of the battalion , he saw the chapel white in the sunlight and the gleaming steeple and the weather vane . The varnished panels around the entrance door caught the high sun . They turned left into the main supply route and went on a few hundred yards . At the Korean market  --  a line of huddled shantylike stores along the road across from a teeming odorous village  --  they turned left again . They drove into the heart of the division area , past a tank company , a military police company , a reconnaissance company , an infantry regiment  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIBRARY . They turned left again and went past a guardpost into a compound whose buildings looked strikingly clean , neat , painted . Paths were clearly marked with whitewashed stones . Vehicles were parked in orderly rows . The compound  --  channeled , graded , terraced  --  sloped gradually toward the crest of a hill . Gabriel Rosen brought the jeep to a stop before a long , white , angle-roofed building . " This is it , sir . " " Goodbye , Gabriel . " " The guys told me to tell youthey. , , heard this is a tough outfit . Spit and polish and everything . Do n't you think you 'll want me ? Wo n't it be hard to break in a new assistant ? " " I do n't give shit about what kind of outfit this is . Find out where to take my things . " Gabriel stared at him , open-mouthed . They had stopped in front of the headquarters building . The sign near the door contained the name of the unit and a picture of a bulldozer painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jeep and went slowly toward the building .  | W=*Uif He followed a sergeant up the path to one of the terraced areas some yards below the crest of the hill . They were completing the new quarters for the officers , the sergeant said . He would have a private room in four or five weeks . In the meantime , did he mind sharing a Jamesway with one of the lieutenants ? He did not mind . He unpacked and set up his books and desk and clothes . He came out into the hot late afternoon air and walked down a narrow , winding , stone-lined path to the officers club . There were introductions and drinks . The officers were young , smartly dressed . The club had a new bar and new chairs and tables . The battalion commander , a well-built man with flat black hair and sharp gray eyes , stood drinking a martini and talking to a major . He nodded to Gershon and introduced him to the major , who shook Gershon 's hand briskly . They went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart ? " a second lieutenant everyone called Skippy asked the orderly behind the bar . The orderly named a movie . " How long is the first reel ? " " It 's a two-beer reel , sir . " " Thank you , Stuart . " Gershon did not remain for the movie . He returned after dinner to his quarters and sat at his desk . Behind him were the desk and chair of his roommate . Their beds were on the other side of the Jamesway , each bed against a wall . It was not unlike the arrangement he had once had in the seminary with Arthur Leiden , save that here no wall separated desks from beds . To the left of his desk was a narrow bookcase , its four rows of  | shelves almost filled with his books . The books were arranged in neat rows . He took down from the top shelf a kabbalistic work by Chaim Vital , a sixteenth-century kabbalist from Safed and Jerusalem . It was a while before he could lose himself in its pages . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his roommate entered . " Awful movie . Awful . A sinful waste of time . " The text blurred , slipped away . Gershon looked up . " I ca n't stand those dumb Westerns . The horses are smarter than the people . Where did I leave my writing paper ? Here we are . Need any writing paper , chaplain ? All set up ? God , you really brought along some books , did n't you . " He peered at the English titles , then looked over at Gershon with a grin . He was in his early twenties , an electrical engineer , with short , light-brown hair , a wide smile , and a warm and friendly air . His name was John Meron , and he was from a small town on Long Island not far from . NewYork City : " Kabbalah ? " he said . " Wow . Maybe you know some prayers that can speed the time up around here . Were you with the medics ? " " Yes . " He seemed about to remark something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got to write my nightly . If you need anything , give a yell . I like to keep on the right side of God . " " Which side is that ? " Meron laughed . He had a light high flowing laugh . " If you do n't know , we 're all in trouble . " " How long do you have left here ? " Gershon asked . " Until next June . " " That 's how long I have . " " It 's too long . " His youngish features grew somber for a moment , then brightened . " We 'll make it . You better believe we 'll make it . " He sat at his desk , writing . The letter took him a long time . He filled many pages , read them slowly , folded them carefully , inserted them into an envelope , sealed the envelope , addressed it , and left it face-up on his desk . He went out for a few minutes , returned , and prepared for bed . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thought to be a Catholic crucifix : the body of Jesus on the cross . " Good night , chaplain . The generators go to sleep at midnight . You need anything ? "  | " No . Thank you . " Gershon sat at the desk awhile longer , reading . Then he too went to bed . He could not sleep . He lay awake in the cool late August night and listened to the sounds all around him : an occasional vehicle ; the quiet voices of officers passing by in the darkness outside ; oriental music and then a news announcer from a radio in an adjoining Jamesway . He heard , barely audibly , something about British and French reactions to the recent Egyptian seizure of the Suez Canal ; the election campaigns of Eisenhower and Stevenson ; a plane crash somewhere in Europe . For a few moments he drifted in and out of sleep . Then he came sharply awake . There was someone in the Jamesway . He sensed someone near his books . He opened his eyes and raised his-fie-ad-from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw no one . Yet there was someone there . He lay back on the pillow . John Meron breathed softly in deep sleep . Distant laughter drifted through the darkness . He thought briefly of the medical battalion and the officers he knew and the major and the chapel on the hill . He felt nearly overwhelmed by a swamping sense of abandonment . Old wounds opened ; buried visions stirred , awakened : a trans-Atlantic steamer sailed slowly away from a Hudson River quay ; a handsome face smiled at him jauntily from the rectangular world of a photograph ; twin graves stood on an inaccessible hill in a distant sun-drenched land . How he hated the night and its dark visions ! Light , he needed light . ' In the morning he rose and dressed and used the tubes tucked discreetly behind the Jamesway in a sheltering rise of earth . He washed and prayed the morning service . Meron , dressing quietly , glanced at him from time to time , taking in the phylacteries on his arm and head , the closed eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershon carved out around him as he prayed . A boyhood friend , now a Jesuit priest , would pray like that : strange carriers of an otherworldly luminosity . The chaplain  --  pale skin , dark eyes , thick dark hair  --  looked gaunt , almost skeletal , a curious intensity on his boned features , a blended aura of anger and sadness hovering about him . He saw him touch the fingers of his right hand to his eyes and murmur some words . There was sanctity here , the  | holiness of altars and candle-lit chambers of meditation and quiet groves on green hillsides  --  places his Jesuit friend had once shown him when they met after a long separation and recounted their young lives . And what was John doing ? Generators , power lines , power plants , transformers ; John was supplying warmth and light to the world . All right ? Each to his own light . His Jesuit friend had laughed and placed on John 's shoulders an embracing arm . Meron watched the chaplain a moment longer , then went off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be healed , " Gershon prayed , standing , eyes closed , seeing clearly the words . " Give us Your help .. . grant us a complete healing . . . . " Then he prayed , " Bless us , our Father , all of us together , with Your light . . . . " The words hovered before him , the letters shimmered . He could climb the letters , yes , and enter the sixth firmament and wander for the remainder of his time here through the Chamber of Healing and the Chamber of Building and on through to the million lights in the Chamber of Glory , where sat the most perfect of beings on the most exquisite of thrones . And what of those here ? To hell with them ! What was he to Korea and Korea to him ? To hell with all of them ! He opened his eyes . The room  --  desks , chairs , beds , bookcase ? leaped into view . He saw on Meron 's desk the envelope with the letter he had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to breakfast . " Thank you , chaplain . Appreciate it . A lot on my mind this morning , " said Meron . " Where are you going ? Join us . " " I 'll be back in a minute . I 've got to teach the mess sergeant how to feed a card-carrying Jew . " He walked away , trailed by the curious and amused glances of the engineer officers around the table . From the officers mess a path ran level for some feet , sloped downward , turned sharply , and continued on down until it vanished into the flat low area of the compound , a stretch of terrain on which stood Quonsets , buildings with angled roofs , the battalion motor pool , and a length of chewed-up earth crowded with neatly parked heavy construction equipment . There was no chapel . Gershon had been assigned an office in the battalion headquarters Quonset . It was a-Iargc Diicc , with- two windows , two desks , a phone , a file cabinet , a typewriter , some chairs . The office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same Quonset . " I run a tight outfit , chaplain , " he had said to Gershon the day before . " I like my officers to be aware of that . If you 're entitled to your own jeep according to our T.o. , you 'll get one , of course . By all means , find yourself an assistant . You 're not interested in military tactics , by any chance ? I did n't think so . Good luck , chaplain , and welcome to engineers . " That morning he sat at his desk and made some phone calls , then walked over to the motor pool and the carpentry shop . He stood around awhile , chatting with the men . The street talk and gestures of all his early years flowed smoothly from him as he stood amidst men from Detroit , Chicago , Boston . They talked baseball and weather and neighborhoods . Reluctantly they returned to the reality of the day . " We can have it ready for you tomorrow morning , chaplain . Oiled , greased , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll wire it to the front bumper guard . Sure . It 'll hold . Anytime , chaplain . " He interviewed three men that afternoon , all regular attendants at his services , and chose one of them  --  a tall gangly clerk from the military police company ; quiet , efficient ; a Jewish boy from Boston ? as his assistant . Then he typed and sent through channels a request to have Jewish services transferred from the medical battalion chapel to the chapel in the nearby infantry regiment . He had lunch at the officers mess . He ate scrambled eggs and listened to the talk about construction projects . The entire division was in transition to permanent housing , sewage , roads , power . Some of the talk was technical . He sat at the same table with John Meron and listened quietly . He returned to his office and prepared his monthly report . He stated that he had been reassigned and offered no explanations . He did not know what to say . At fifteen minutes to five he cleared his desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room . A few minutes later , Meron came in . " Tired , " he murmured . " Long day . " He lay down on his bed and put his hand over his eyes . Gershon turned off the phonograph . " You can play it , chaplain , " Meron said , his hand over his eyes . " No problem . " Later , at the bar , Skippy asked , " What 's the movie tonight , Stuart ? "  | The orderly gave him the name of the movie . Skippy , whose full name was Edward Skipworth , raised his beer glass in a sweeping gesture . " Another epic of the West , gentlemen . How long is the first reel ? " " It 's a three-beer reel , sir . " " Thank you , Stuart . " The battalion commander , standing at the bar with a martini in his hand , asked Gershon , " How was your day , chaplain ? " " Fine , sir . " " We want you to feel yourself part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " We 're bringing civilization to this place , chaplain . Roads , sewage , power plants . Did you see the story in Stars and Stripes ? " " Which story was that , sir ? " " Civilization Fights Boredom . Morale at an All-Time High . ' You did n't see it ? " " No , sir . I missed that one . " " Fine story . They did n't mention us , though . There 's a meeting of our officers tomorrow at eighteen hundred you might want to attend . " " I have to go to Seoul tomorrow , sir . I 'll have about a thousand men at Ascom City for the Jewish High Holidays . There are some details I have to take care of . " " Why does n't the man in Seoul worry about it ? " The battalion commander sipped from his martini glass and gazed narrowly at Gershon . " There is n't any man in Seoul , sir . I 'm the only Jewish chaplain in Korea . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover a large territory . You 're the Only Jewish chapl-ainin Kotea , and you 've just been made Special Troops chhain " Yes , sir . " Some of the officers were standing around listening to the conversation . The major who was the battalion adjutant said , " My God , the infinite wisdom of the army . " " We 're having a field exercise in the middle of next week , chaplain , " said the battalion commander . " I think you ought to join us for that . What do you think , Paul ? "  | " Very important , " said the adjutant . " Definitely . " " I have to be in Ascom City for most of next week , sir , " Gershon said . " The High Holidays are next week . " " Is that right ? Well , I hope we see you around from time to time , chaplain , " the battalion commander said . " Can I buy you a drink ? " " Thank you , sir . Yes . Scotch on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , sir , " said the orderly from behind the bar . Gershon returned to his quarters after dinner and found Meron writing a letter . The lieutenant was bent over the paper and barely noticed Gershon 's presence . Gershon began a letter to his aunt and uncle . The Jamesway was silent save for the scratchings of pens on paper . Somewhere nearby an armed forces radio announcer was giving the news . Meron put down his pen , read the letter , folded its many pages , inserted it in an envelope , sealed it , addressed it , and left it face-up on his desk . He yawned and stretched and looked at Gershon , who had long completed his letter and was trying to get into a passage of Kabbalah , without success . " You want to see the movie , chaplain ? " " I do n't think so . " " Neither do I. The wholesale slaughter of Indians does n't appeal to me . Are you married , chaplain ? " " No . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised we 'd write every day , and I have n't missed a day yet . Not a day . I 've made it a habit . " " You have to really want a habit like that . " " You better believe I want it . " " I wish a girl I know wanted it . " " Not enough mail , chaplain ? " " Not from her . She writes articles for philosophy journals and lectures for her classes . She does n't seem to like writing letters . Listen , I want to ask you something . If I needed to have something built for religious purposes , can I give the request to the colonel ? " " What do you want built , chaplain ? " " It 's called a succah . It 's a kind of booth or hut with wooden sides and an open roof covered with leaves and branches . " " You 'll have to include the specs with the request . "  | " I can do that . " " It should n't be a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he knows you 're giving him a full day 's work . He wants his bird before he goes home . His wife 's father is a three-star general in the Pentagon . The colonel really wants that bird . He keeps us in a sweat , but he knows what he 's doing all the time . He 's sharp . We 're not going to see much of you here , are we ? Why did they give you Special Troops ? That 's four thousand men , plus all the Jewish personnel in Korea . You 're either very good ar somebody does n't like you . " He thought for a moment and grinned . " Or both . " " I wish I knew , " Gershon said . " I do n't . " The next morning he flew to Seoul and was informed by the Eighth Army chaplain that for some reason the Jewish chaplain they were expecting daily would not arrive until some time in October . The second chaplain would come soon after . " I wish I knew what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what 's going on and I ca n't get any answers . Can I help you in any way with your holiday arrangements ? " " Everything 's all set up . " " The people at Ascom like the way you do things , chaplain . " " I 'm not doing anything special . " " Do you need a lift back to the airfield ? " " Yes , sir . " " Use my jeep and driver . " " Thank you . " " Happy new year , chaplain . " " Thank you , sir . " He flew back in a rainstorm and landed in rain and fog . He called battalion from the airstrip , and a jeep and driver were dispatched to bring him back . He climbed the hill to his quarters , feeling very tired . The rain had become an annoying drizzle . He entered his room and saw John Meron sitting in a chair and looking at his bookcase . The second lieutenant rose awkwardly , his boyish features flushing . " Sorry , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't be silly , John . Read whatever you want . How was your day ? "  | " Nothing special . I really like your books , chaplain . I did n't touch any of them , you understand . I would n't do that . Are these Hebrew ? Aramaic ? They look , old . I really admire your books . I have a friend who goes in for books . He 's a Jesuit priest . A great guy . Boy , does he buy books . " " Borrow whatever you want , John . Anytime . Just keep the line straight . You know , keep the books lined up straight . I have a friend who used to enjoy pushing them in . I think I 'll take a shower and head down to the club . I can use a drink . Did you ever fly in an L- , 9 through a rainstorm ? I thought I would become the reason for a memorial service . " He went back down the path and along the division road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club and sat around talking with the officers . After dinner he sat through the first reel of a movie musical . In the darkness of the club he heard Skippy 's voice . " How long is this second reel going to be , Stuart my boy ? " " It 's a three-beer reel , sir . " , " Thank you , Stuart my boy . " " I think we 're going to have to take out the bridge across your beer supply , lieutenant , " came the voice of the battalion commander in the darkness . " That would constitute an abridgment of my rights , sir . " There was laughter from the officers in the room . The movie came back on , a garish color spectacle of skin and nonsense . Some time after the movie Gershon returned to his quarters . The night was cool . He found Meron asleep . He read for a while and went to bed . He slept and woke and sensed again , with a shiver of fear , a presence near his books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next night he waited until Meron had completed his " nightly , " as he called it . When the letter lay sealed and addressed on his roommate 's desk , Gershon asked quietly if he might impose upon him for a favor . He needed careful diagrams of the succah , with a list of the lumber and the man-hours required to accomplish the work . He could draw the hut , but he was not sure he would be able to translate the drawings into lumber and men . " Let 's see the drawing , chaplain . "  | Meron watched Gershon sketch the hut on a sheet of airmail paper . " That 's no problem , " he said . " But I do n't think they 'll let you put brush on the roof . The brush here has bugs and things , and some people think it may cause hemorrhagic fever . And I do n't think they 'll let you take branches off live trees . Let me think about it . Ca n't you use anything else ? " " It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Use a camouflage net . " " What ? " " A camouflage net should do it , chaplain . It looks like brush and leaves . You 'll have some sunlight coming through it . " The succah needed the leaves and branches of living wood , not the dead gnarled strings of a net . That night , in the darkness of the Jamesway , Gershon had a dreamlike vision . The man who appeared to him in this vision listened patiently to Gershon 's words , then smiled in his disdainful way and said , There is no wood available , Loran ? In all of Korea ? It 's a big succah , professor . The seminary also builds a big succah , Loran . We ca n't use brush . There is a danger of disease from insects . Disease ? Yes , professor . And your only solution is to use a  --  how do you call it ? ? a camouflage net ? Yes . Well  --  use it . Thank you . Loran . Yes ? You are not taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a far more serious violation of Halacha than to build a succah with camouflage nets . Do you feel all right ? I feel fine , professor . Take care of yourself , Loran . Professor . Wait . Please . I have  --  another problem . Yes ?  | Professor Keter does n't answer my letters . No ? Write him again . The fact that he does not answer your letters does not mean that he does not read them . Enjoy your succah , Loran . And he gave Gershon the traditional greeting in Hebrew for the Jewish new year . For a long time his image remained in the dark silent air of the Jamesway  --  the roundish pink face , the blue eyes , the silver hair , the lips with the haughty disparaging smile  --  the image of Professor Nathan Malkuson . Then , slowly , it faded . The days went by . As he rode around the division , driven by the tall silent soldier who was his new assistant , he saw the transformation that was taking place all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by new Quonsets ; permanent buildings of stone and wood were being erected ; the drab and gray heaviness of blotched outside walls was being repaired and painted . On the way north to the infantry regiment one day he saw rows of new Quonsets on the hill behind the medical battalion and the skeleton of the structure that would be the new chapel . In the engineering battalion the officers Quonset was under construction on the crest of the hill above the present line of Jamesways . The tents of the enlisted men gradually disappeared . One afternoon during that week , while digging out a large rectangle of earth for the cement floor of a Quonset , a bulldozer opened a vast common grave that contained more than thirty skeletons of boys whose age could not have been more than fifteen or sixteen . Gershon was in Seoul when it happened , and he learned of it in the officers club that night from Meron . " What did they do ? " " They covered it over and moved the building somewhere else . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who killed them ? " " The communists . " In Seoul that afternoon he had seen a policeman beating a young boy , beating him on a street , with his club , beating him , the boy cowering , head bent , standing beneath the blows , men and women passing by , averting their eyes .  | " I hate this place , " he said to Meron . " I do n't know anyone who does n't , chaplain . " " How was your day , chaplain ? " the battalion commander asked . " Fine , sir . " " We do n't see you , chaplain . You seem to be everywhere except with us . The G-4 has approved your little construction project . " " Sir ? " " That  --  what was it ? ? that succah . " He pronounced it " sookky . " " Oh . Yes , sir . Thank you . " " What good are you to us if you 're never here , chaplain ? " Early the next morning Gershon gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to Ascom City . He talked with officers and sergeants about quarters for the Jewish personnel coming in to attend services for the High Holidays ; he talked with mess sergeants about food . On the way back he watched through the flimsy window of the aircraft as the sun went down in a spectacular display of colors , deep red and yellow and orange and violet playing across the sky . It seemed a strange and discordant sight : broken light splashing pastel loveliness across the blood and suffering of the broken land . He returned to Ascom City a few days later . Nearly one thousand men came into the base from all over the country . There were two days of services . He rode back to the battalion in a typhoon . His assistant drove the jeep skilfully . They went along flooded roads and over bridges beneath which streams had turned into torrents . The wind tore at the canvas top and sides and at the plastic windows . He returned exhausted to his quarters and found a letter from his aunt . His uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healthy new year . They should all be together again soon and in health . He should be careful . Did he need anything ? His uncle sent his love . Two days later there was a half-page story in Stars and Stripes about the High Holiday services . His picture was in the paper , as well as his jeep with the blue and white wooden tablets wired to the front bumper . Prominently mentioned after his name in the caption beneath his picture was the engineer battalion . He returned to Ascom City in the second week of September to  | conduct the service for the Day of Atonement . He fasted all that day , and all that day he stood on his feet , leading the service in the thronged chapel . He felt oddly light-headed at the end of the day and ate little . He slept in Ascom City that night , and in a dream he was in the dormitory elevator with Professor Malkuson and the elevator jammed between floors and he stood there calmly discussing some passages of Talmud with the professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to the battalion . That afternoon a squad of men from one of the battalion companies was brought over to the area near division headquarters . There on a knoll on the edge of the division parade ground , which fronted the offices of the commanding general and the division chaplain , Gershon chose an area of ground . He watched as the men measured it , marked it with cords , began cutting the wood . The next day there was a story in Stars and Stripes about the Yom Kippur service . Once again there was his jeep and the name of the battalion . " You 're making us famous , " Meron told him that evening . Gershon did not respond . " Are you all right , chaplain ? You look awful . " " I think I 'm still recovering from the fast . " " I 've got some really good cookies my fiancee sent me . " K. " Thanks , no . John , I could use a drink . Witt ' youj in me ? " r " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on . " The succah was completed the next day . Gershon watched as the men pulled the camouflage nets over the top of the succah . They used two nets . A cool and speckled dimness settled upon the interior of the succah . Outside , the parade ground baked in the early afternoon sun . Gershon thanked the men and shook their hands . He thanked the sergeant and patted his shoulder . The men left . Gershon stood alone outside the succah . He could smell its freshcut wood . He circled it slowly . It seemed larger than he had thought it would be when he had outlined its dimensions on the piece of paper for Meron . Clean , clean . New wood everywhere , two-byfours , plywood , the interior bare , the earth uncovered . He would have chairs brought in and tables for an altar and wine and cakes for Kiddush . The power cord strung from the nearby Quonset would give them light . He came through the door and stood inside the  | sudden shadows that lay upon the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself in a silent and motionless embrace the tranquility of this hut that he had caused to be built  --  this memory of a wilderness wandering and of booths dwelt in during ancient harvests . Men came from all over the division to attend the services of the Festival of Booths . He preached about the temporary and the permanent in life , about the need to build again and again despite all the minor and major destructions visited upon us by man and God . And he would come to the succah in the early evenings and sit in its shadows and listen to the soft winds moving through the camouflage nets . One morning he came to the succah and there was the G-4 , dark eyes , dark hair , short of stature , saturnine . " Nice , chaplain , " he said . " Very nice . " " Thank you for approving it , sir . " " You seem to enjoy having engineers do your building for you , chaplain . What next ? " " I ca n't think of anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chaplain . " " Thank you , sir . " He came into the succah one evening that week and sat in a chair in front of the table he had set up as an altar . On the table lay the palm frond and citron he had been sent airmail from the Jewish Welfare Board in the States . These were the living symbols of the festival , its green and golden life . Two bulbs burned brightly below the canopy of camouflage nets . It was a cool evening . Always you invited guests into your succah ; that was an ancient tradition . And always there were invisible guests there as well  --  ushpizin , they were called  --  the patriarchs Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . You shared the loveliness of the hut , the sweet sadness of its intimate , bare , and temporary beauty . There was a knock on the door . " Yes , " Gershon heard himself say , for he knew who waited outside . The door opened . Nathan Malkuson entered and was followed immediately by Jakob Keter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival .  | How did you manage such a thing in this barbaric land ? asked Nathan Malkuson . I thought of it . A gentile drew up the plans . The engineers built it . They sat in chairs before the altar . An unusual roof , said Malkuson , looking up . What do you say , Keter ? Is it not an unusual roof ? Unusual , said Jakob Keter . It conceals and reveals simultaneously . It hides the sun and lets in the sun simultaneously . Unusual . Yes . How are you , Mr. Loran ? All right , I guess , professor . I do read your letters , Mr. Loran . This is not exactly a proper succah , Loran , said Professor Malkuson . A synagogue and a succah at one and the same time . Interesting . And unusual . But all things considered Do you read , Mr. Loran ? Do you study ? Yes . I 'm trying . Do not stop studying , Mr. Loran . In a place where there are no people , you be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had in mind the seminary succah when you drew up the plans ? The camouflage effect is intriguing . I think we will study a little , and then leave . What do you say , Keter ? A little Talmud can not hurt . Not nearly as much as a little Kabbalah . What shall we study , Malkuson ? Gershon sat very still ancinhis vision studied Torah with his two teachers , his ushpizin , his guests in the silent interior of his succah on this cool Korean night . The next day he saw with amazement the full-page spread on the succah in Stars and Stripes , the story of its construction by the battalion and a brief account of the festival . There were many photographs . He had not thought they would turn it into so big a story . " Fine story , chaplain , " said the battalion commander . " Let me buy you a drink . Getting some nice calls about that story . Very pretty succah . " After dinner that evening Gershon walked down the path from the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | and along the division road to the parade ground . He stood for a moment on the knoll near the door to the succah . The sky was paling into dusk from its brilliant stream of sunset colors . He saw over a distant hill a single star . He gazed at its flickering brightness . Another star appeared , not far from the first : pinpoints of bluish light bearing down upon him from  --  his own world ? another galaxy ? living stars ? the lights of stars long dead ? He came into the darkening interior of the succah and sat in a chair before the altar . The camouflage nets were dark now overhead . Night came as he sat and with it the canopy of starry sky . Through the nets he could see many stars . How alone he felt on this speck of cosmic dust that was his home . Still , there were questions to be asked , and he waited . He sensed after a while a puff of wind in the darkness , a growing invisibility around him . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask Him . Ask Him now . He was here , in all His power . Ask . Listen . Please . Why do You make them suffer so , these people , this land ? Jews suffer because many think them to be the reconnaissance troops for the world , and such troops take the highest casualties . But to suffer merely because you are in the path of empires ! How meaningless such suffering ! Explain it . Please . There was no answer . Gershon remained silent . One does not act rudely toward a guest . They sat together in the darkness until the air grew cold . Gershon shivered and rose and left the succah and returned to his battalion . Four days later he watched with sadness as the succah was dismantled . The plywood and two-by-fours were piled into a truck . The camouflage nets were folded . The men went away . Gershon stood alone on the empty earth , which still bore the marks of the two-by-fours that had framed the succah . It was the first week of October . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt a wearying melancholy settle upon him . Nothing now until Chanukah . Into the fall and winter now . A lengthy tunnel of darkness now . He stood there a long time on the scuffed and trodden earth of the vanished succah . Then he walked back slowly to the battalion . The new chaplain arrived ten days later , an efficient , friendly career soldier , a major , who acclimated himself cheerfully to the  | Seoul chapel . Gershon liked him but could not take his cheerfulness for too long without in some strange way feeling himself made melancholy by it . This chaplain took responsibility for the Jewish personnel of Seoul , Inchon , Ascom , Pusan , and I Corps at Uijongbu . Gershon tended to the line divisions . The days grew short . Sharp coldness invaded the nights . He faced the winter with a determined sense of calm , whose source he could not understand but which he found distinctly pleasurable . The officers Quonsets were finally completed in the middle of October . One day a sergeant appeared in Gershon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jamesway about seven weeks before . That night Gershon talked with his roommate . When it came time for the officers to leave the Jamesways , Gershon chose to room with John Meron . He packed his belongings and moved to the Quonset on the crest of the hill . Two weeks later the second of the rrew Jewish chaplain arrived in Korea . He announced his arrival to Gershon in a curious way . Gershon had no idea who he might . be . He had asked about those who had originally been slated to come and when they had not appeared had simply lost interest . He had recognized none of the names given him . The weeks before the arrival of the new chaplain were of a calmness he had not thought it possible to achieve in this land . He rode by jeep and plane throughout the line divisions . His jeep was known ; men hailed him as he drove along the roads . The air was cool and autumnal , graced with clear light and with sunsets that emptied him of words . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebirth from the carnage of war : the start of permanent dwellings in villages , clean new shops in the nearby Korean market , paved roads . The engineers were busy , busy . He saw little of the officers save when he ate with the battalion . When he was in his office it seemed an endless line of men trooped in to see him . They came from all the Special Troop outfits of the division . He felt himself chaplain of all the valley . His assistant typed with swift and silent efficiency ,  | cared for the files , drove him about . On occasion when Gershon heard him speak in the accents of his native New England , memories were evoked in him of seminary years that seemed so distant now it was as if they had never been . He received a letter from Karen , her first in more than a month . Her father had been ill  --  a mild coronary just before the High Holidays . The family had been plunged into a turmoil of dread . He was well riow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted for publication . She enjoyed the clippings he sent . But why did he need to travel around so much ? And he looked so thin . She missed him . She loved him . She would try to write more often . Did he know that Jakob Keter was spending the semester at the University of Pennsylvania ? Did he want her to send him some cookies and things ? Her parents sent their very best . He should n't worry about her father . He was really all right now . And Gershon dreamed of her that night , held her to him , felt upon his fingers the moist warmth of her flesh , dreamed until there came over him the moment of exquisite release . Officers came and went in the battalion . There were parties for those leaving  --  sayonara parties , they were called  --  boisterous affairs that Gershon would attend for a while , then slip away from to return to his quarters  --  invariably to find John at his desk writing his letter . He would read and listen to music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave for a trip to a distant unit . They knew him now at the airstrip . And he knew the pilots of the division air company . He knew the MP and recon company sergeants , the ordnance and quartermaster sergeants , officers and noncoms up and down the valley , in the distant regiment , in the other line division . It was in those final days of October that the medical battalion moved to the hill . He watched the completion of the new chapel as he rode by day after day along the main supply route . It rose on the hill like a white light , the steeple , without a cross , shining against the clear blue autumn sky . The old compound was now the division replacement depot . Chaplains interviewed and evaluated all enlisted men who came down with venereal disease . He saw many every week who had it . Often they caught it at that replacement depot on their first night in the division . He would drive past the compound  | and see himself walking across it in the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . He saw the fear in his eyes , felt the pounding in his heart . How strange that he had not heard that loud beating of his heart for such a long time now . He sensed that he had conquered something inside himself . He did not know what it was , but he was certain it lay vanquished , and the thought filled him with exultation each time he drove by the old medical battalion compound . The chapel was gone . The hospital was gone . All was gone to the hill . He did not once ride up to that hill . He felt no need for that . His was now the world of the river valley . There were maneuvers in that valley and its nearby hills , the thud of heavy guns , infantry charges . Jets wheeled overhead . Tanks roamed the valley and churned the earth . American and Korean troops moved up and down the main supply route in trucks and jeeps . He slept two nights in the field with the battalion . The day they returned he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew to the division near Panmunjom . Then he drove to the artillery unit in the hills . Leaves had turned and were beginning to fall . The land was bathed in soft browns and reds and yellows and seemed to have become comforting to his eyes . The fields were still green , flowers sparkled on the hills . He saw farmers working the terraced earth , children on the roads on their way to school , old men in flowing white garments and tall stovepipe hats watching him stoically as he rode by . Once he saw on the road an old man wearing a tall dark skullcap , and he was reminded of his uncle . He came close to sensing a dignity and strength in the suffering people of the land . Yes , there was disease , there was filth . There were pimps and whores and thieves . Armies , the most peripheral of guests , always brought out the peripheral from among their hosts . Early in the last week of October came the first night of frost . Water that John had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rode to Seoul that day for an administrative conference of Eighth Army chaplains and in the late afternoon visited the Jewish chapel . The chaplain cheerfully showed him around . A new section had been added on to it . The building now had , in addition to the chapel , a lounge , offices , a refrigerator , a freezer , a stove . " I asked and they gave , " said the chaplain . " Good people , fine people .  | Can I treat you to a kosher dinner , Gershon ? " They ate together in the lounge , served by a Korean woman . A Korean university student interested in Judaism ate with them . The talk rambled . The student talked reluctantly of his childhood in a village near Pusan , the loss of his two brothers in the war . What was the next holiday of the Jewish people ? he wanted to know , speaking softly and not looking directly at either of them . What did it mean , Chanukah ? How was it celebrated ? They talked of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student said quietly . Then the South Korean army would invade the north , Gershon said . Yes , said the student . The north would be defeated and the Chinese would enter the war , said Gershon . Yes , said the student , and the Americans would return and they would all then be able to complete the conquest of the north and reunite their sacred land . The conversation turned back to Chanukah . On the way out of the chapel Gershon asked about the incoming Jewish chaplain . He was due in a few days , said the other . No , it was n't the one they had expected , it was someone else , he did n't have the name and could n't understand the cause of all the confusion . Did Gershon want to take some chicken back with him to the battalion ? That week parkas were issued to division personnel . On a day toward the end of that month Gershon drove to Seoul and recorded six broadcasts for the armed forces radio station . He returned to the battalion late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone . The new rectangular oil furnace burned silently . Over the radio he had bought a few days before at the PX came news of a threat of war in the Middle East . He washed and changed into a fresh uniform . He sensed something wrong about the room . He did not know what it was . They had arranged the room in the Quonset precisely as they had the Jamesway . He looked slowly around and shrugged and put on his battalion scarf . He wondered what the movie would be that night . He stood at the door a moment , gazed around the room , then opened the door and stepped out . It was nearly dark . The air was cold . He closed the door and started down the path toward the officers club . Then he stopped . His eyes now saw vividly what they had looked at but had not seen before . A slow  | wheeling of the world occurred then for him , a shuddering movement through all things near and far . He turned and ran back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the doorway , staring at the bookcase near his desk . Some of the books on the shelves had been pushed in . From his office in the deserted headquarters Quonset he called Seoul . Then he called the medical battalion of the division near Panmunjom . A few minutes before noon the next day his jeep pulled off the road and into the compound of the distant medical battalion . The jeep came to a stop in front of the headquarters Quonset . Standing outside waiting for him was Arthur Leiden.  | W41f4t On the telephone the day before he had said , " Arthur , is it you ? Is it really you ? " " Hello ? I can hardly hear you . Hello ? " The voice came through as if muffled by water . " Who is this ? " " It 's Gershon . Can you hear me now ? " " Barely . Dear Gershon . Hello . " " I ca n't believe this . What are you doing here ? " " I drove by to surprise you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . I thought you were in the navy . " " The navy is a long story , dear Gershon . I was sufficiently suave but insufficiently secure for the navy . Hello ? Can you hear me ? This is a terrible telephone , Gershon . Is this the best they can do in this place for telephones ? " " Arthur ? " " Yes ? " " Will you be in your battalion tomorrow around noon ? " " I was n't planning on going anywhere tomorrow . " " I 'll see you then . " " Hello ? Gershon ? " " Yes ? " " Are you going to Japan anytime soon ? " " I have a religious retreat in a few weeks . Why do ? ? " " I 've got to get to Japan . " " You just got to Korea , Arthur . " " I know where I am , Gershon . Is getting to Japan a problem ? What do I have to do ? "  | " We 'll talk when I see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you tomorrow , Arthur . We 'll talk about Japan tomorrow . " " How can we run an army with this telephone system ? " " Goodbye , Arthur . It is you , is n't it ? Arthur ? " " It 's me , dear Gershon . Yes . " He climbed out of the jeep . They stood a moment in the sunlight looking at each other . Incredibly , Arthur 's face was deeply tanned . He wore a combat outfit and a field jacket and cap . His name was on a patch over the right breast pocket . He looked slightly stooped , and he squinted in the bright noonday sun . They shook hands . Gershon said , " Hello , Arthur . You 're not a vision , are you ? " " You would know that better than I , dear Gershon . Am I beautifully unexpected ? " " That 's an apt way to put it . Yes . " " This whole place looks to me like a vision . " You ' . ve lost weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you all right ? " " I 've never felt better in my life . Do you have an assistant and an office yet ? Are they giving you a jeep ? " " I only just got here . I 'm not even sure I know what day of the week today is . My spacetime has suffered curvature and fluctuation . The mass of this mess is too much for me . A joke from Uncle Albert . Never mind . Are you hungry ? I woke up too late for breakfast . Let 's get something to eat . How do you keep kosher in this place ? You 'll have to teach me everything . " Gershon turned to his assistant , who sat looking at them from behind the wheel of the jeep . " Howard , get some lunch . Meet me back here in an hour . This is Chaplain Arthur Leiden . Howard Morten . Also from around Boston . " " Really ? " said Arthur with only mild interest . " Where ? " " Chestnut Hill , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neighbors. "  | " I 'm pleased to meet you , sir . Are you related to Charles Leiden , sir ? " " Yes . I 'm related to Charles Leiden . I like your jeep , Gershon . I like those tablets . There was a piece on you and your jeep in an issue of Stars and Stripes in Camp Drake . I saw it the night I laid over in Japan . What night was that ? I forget . They even had a story on you in the local paper in Albuquerque . " " Where ? What were you doing in Albuquerque ? " " I was serving your uncle and mine , dear Gershon . That 's right . Our God was not kind to His humble servant . I seem to gravitate toward certain dark holes on the planet , and sometimes with nearly the speed of light . It was n't enough that I grew up near there while they made the fucking bomb  --  if you 'll pardon the expression ; I had to be stationed there too . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with His frail servant ? " Two enlisted men went by . Gershon and Arthur returned their salutes . Three two-and-a-half-ton trucks passed along the road , sending up clouds of dust . An ambulance went past the battalion guardpost and turned onto the road . Two elderly Korean men walked slowly by on the road , the A-frames on their backs laden with brush . The autumnal noon air carried odors of sour cabbage and sewage . " Am I supposed to get used to this ? " Arthur asked . " Is that the idea ? " " I do n't know what the idea is , Arthur . This place has just been through a war . " " Another moment of glory in the history of the species . Come on , Gershon . Let 's eat . " They started across the compound , a narrow , flat stretch of terrain at the rim of a small valley . On the crest of the hill beyond the battalion were gun emplacements and observation posts that faced a river and a bridge and more gun emplacements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-strewn flatland and then the gun emplacements and observation posts of the communist army . " Have you seen this place ? " Arthur asked . " Have you been around here ? "  | " I 've been conducting services here once a week for months . " " They 've put me at the end of the world . " He was silent a moment as they passed a noncom . " That idiot MacArthur wanted to use the bomb on them . How do we ever manage to survive our generals ? " " Arthur , I think ? " " I 'm quoting my mother , dear Gershon . I will be discreet . Trust me . Mouth closed . A general is a deity . I know . What do I do about kashrut up here , Gershon ? I have n't eaten traif since I left Harvard . " " Did n't he tell you anything in Seoul ? " " My God , Gershon , he 's such a smiling clod . He put my teeth on edge . I spent twenty minutes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess sergeant . What did you eat in New Mexico ? " " I lived off the generosity of our brethren in Albuquerque and Los Alamos . You would be surprised at how many members of our tribe are involved in the protection of our land through weapons development . You would be surprised at the weapons . Enough said . The enemy is everywhere , right ? Especially the F.B.I . and the C.I.D . and all the other letters of the alphabet . God , I 'm hungry . What day is today ? I 'm not kidding . I 've really lost track of time . " They sat in the officers mess over scrambled eggs and coffee . " The navy danced me round and round , " Arthur said . " They were sure , they were n't sure . I was cleared , I was n't cleared . They approved , they disapproved . My father started making phone calls . Then my mother started making phone calls . My mother makes extraordinary phone calls . Nothing . No one could buck the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminary released me . " " How do you mean , released you ? " " From my chaplaincy obligation . " Gershon stared at him . " What is the poor bastard doing here , you are asking . Right ? I volunteered for the army instead . That 's right . The thought of being the only one in our class to escape the chaplaincy because of some stupid bureaucratic idiocy was too much for me , dear Gershon . How face the accusing light in all your eyes for a lifetime ? Right ? I thought of the air force and chose the army . Less fussy , the army .  | Less hysterical . My father was disappointed . Very long naval tradition in the family . Listen . When we 're done , will you show me how you work your files and schedule your services ? How do you keep day-to-day records ? Do you have anything to do with non-Jews , or is it only Jews who come to you ? God , I 'm tired all of a sudden . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battalion officers had been stopping by to greet Gershon . The adjutant , a tall , red-haired major , said , " There 's going to be a war out there , chaplain . " " I hope not , " Gershon said . " We may all see Jerusalem if there 's a war out there , " the adjutant said , walking off . " What 's he talking about ? " Arthur asked . " Do n't you know what 's going on ? " " I do n't know anything . Listen . How many times have you been to Japan ? " " Twice . " " That 's all ? Twice ? " " This is n't a picnic , Arthur . This is a combat zone . " " Did you see Kyoto ? " " Yes . " " Did you like it ? " " Sure . It 's a beautiful city . I think we ? " " I have to see Kyoto , Gershon . " " It 's worth seeing . " " No . I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a long ride back to my battalion , and I do n't want to navigate those mountain passes at night . You wanted to know something about files and things . " " Okay , dear Gershon . Okay . But first I must , I absolutely must , go to the john . Will you join me ? " Some minutes later , as they walked back across the compound , Arthur said , " Do you hear from Karen ? " " Yes . Not often , but I hear . " " I 've lost all touch with them . " " Her father had a mild heart attack . He 's recovered . " " Are you still studying Kabbalah ? "  | " Yes . " " With Keter ? " " Informally , you might say . " " He 's in Philadelphia for the semester . He went there in the summer from Jerusalem for some kind of specialized surgery and decided to be near his doctors for a while , so U of P invited him to teach . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " " Keter is indestructible . He has an inexhaustible supply of incantations and all kinds of private agreements with the forces of light and darkness . Gershon , when can I go to Japan ? " " You 'll be due for an R and R in early March , I think . " ' " March ? I do n't want to wait until March . " " Arthur ? " " For God 's sake , Gershon , you do n't think I volunteered to come here so I can sit on my ? " " Volunteered ? You volunteered ? " " I did n't even know it was open until less than a month ago . Someone else was going . I made some phone calls . It was a mess . I did n't do all that just to sit here . " Gershon stopped . They were approaching the headquarters building . His assistant stood near the jeep , talking with a group of enlisted men . Gershon saw them all stare at Arthur for a moment , then look away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , " he said . " What 's in Japan , Arthur ? What 's going on ? " " January ? I can wait until January . Yes . January is fine . " " Let me show you how to handle the files and the reports . " They worked together inside a small , windowless office . " You 're going to miss that Albuquerque sunlight after a while , " Gershon said . " You think so , dear Gershon ? I 've got news for you . I do n't think I 'm going to miss it at all . " " You ought to interview some kids and get yourself an assistant . And a jeep . You 'll be covering your entire division . You 'll probably need to do a lot of flying too . You 've got units all up and down these hills . "  | " Maybe I 'll get my name in the papers too . " " It 's good to see you , Arthur . Really . It got very lonely here at times . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . I 'll have evening services and I 'll light the candles . I 'm not planning anything special . " " There 's no way I can get to Japan before January ? " " Arthur ? " " Okay , okay . I 'll call you later in the week . I hate those phones . How do we ever win wars with those phones ? " Later , on the road through the mountains , his assistant said , " Sir , Chaplain Leiden 's father once talked to our high school at an assembly . That 's how I remembered him . He 's a physicist , is n't he ? " " Yes . " " Did n't he have something to do with the atomic bomb ? " " Yes . " " That 's why I remembered him . Some of the other guys also remembered his name . Charles Leiden . That bomb probably saved my brother 's life . He was all set to go in with the invasion of Japan . " " What did he talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . Something about the future . I do n't remember . " A wind blew through the mountains . The spines of the hills were bare and stony . Small valleys lay below the towering ridges . There was little traffic on this road . He could see villages and oxen and terraced hillsides and scrub brush and browning grass . The jeep bounced on the rough road , and he held himself relaxed in the hard seat , not fighting it , feeling the ruts and stones through the jeep floorboard , through his boots , into his legs and spine . He was glad he would not have to traverse these hills as often now as he had before . This was Arthur 's territory now . How strange Arthur seemed , off balance somehow , the cool poise all on the surface . He thought a moment longer about Arthur , then forgot him . The sun had slid behind the hills . The road was in deep shadow . They drove in tense silence until they came down out of the hills . A hazy dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a fresh uniform . Wearied by  | the jeep ride over the hills and disturbed by the nervous disorientation he had sensed in Arthur Leiden , he wanted silence in the room and did not turn on the radio or phonograph . He remembered clearly and with regret the inadvertent remark made long ago to the F.B.I . agent about the cards Arthur had written . Could that have hurt Arthur 's entry into the navy ? Why had he said that ? To this day he did not know . He had done so many things he could not really understand , as if in obedience to some dark law of human gravity which moved him pitilessly this way and that and lay beyond comprehension . Arthur Leiden in Korea in the next division . They would share the line divisions as they had once shared a room . How strange the machinations of the Author of light . In the officers club , the battalion commander stood at the bar with a martini in one hand and a copy of Stars and Stripes in the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colonel looked up from the newspaper . Gershon slid onto a bar stool and ordered a Scotch on the rocks . " Here he is , " the colonel said . " Look what 's going on , chaplain . Your guys are starting the third world war . " Gershon looked at the newspaper . T Israelis had invaded the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip . - going to become a camel division , " he heard someone say behind him . Two days later the division was put on yellow alert and went out to the field . Gershon lived with his battalion , slept in a tent , rode up and down the division to be with his Special Troops . In the Middle East there were paratroop drops , tank battles , the storming of fortifications . The Israelis conquered the-Sinai and the Gaza Strip . Gershon was in the field five days and lost all contact with Arthur Leiden . At the officers briefing the day before the battalion was to leave for the field , the colonel had said , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slicky boys will be out there like locusts . Are there any questions ? " Gershon did not know why he raised his hand . From somewhere a dimly remembered conversation surfaced . Two noncoms in the  | waiting room at Kimpo ? Or was it Tachikawa ? No , it was on board the C-124 during his last flight from Japan , after the R and R and the days in Kyoto and Tokyo . " Sir , " he heard his voice in the crowded room . Could they detect the faint quiver ? " Maybe we can offer something to the Turks and get them to stand perimeter guard for us . " There was a murmur of voices , a subdued stir of surprise . Every head in the room turned to look at him . " What do you have in mind , chaplain ? " the colonel asked in a faraway tone . " I do n't know , sir . Maybe they could use some ditch-digging equipment for a while . Some such thing . " Why had he said that ? Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the faint tremor was gone out of his voice . The colonel looked at him from across the room . " Let me think about it , chaplain . Any more questions , gentlemen ? " For the five nights they slept in the field , Turkish troops patrolled their perimeter . The Turks usually shot the thieves they spotted ; or  --  so went the rumor  --  they castrated them or , in the winter , staked them out naked in the snow and left them to freeze to death . On the last night it rained . Gershon , dressed and half-asleep , heard the sound of nearby rifle fire . He did not leave his sleeping bag but lay very still listening to the rain on his tent . No one talked about it in the morning , and he said nothing . They returned to the compound in the cold November rain . In the club that evening , officers thumped him on the back . Not a single theft had occurred . " I think I 'm going to take a Turk home with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure feeling . " " Have a drink , chaplain , " the colonel said . " Stuart , a Scotch on the rocks for the chaplain . " " Yes , sir . " " The medics got themselves creamed , " said Skippy . " No , " someone said . " Really ? " " All the slicky boys the Turks kept away from us descended on the poor medics . " There was laughter . i  | " Your guys do n't have to worry about slicky boys , right , chaplain ? " the colonel said . " A four-day war . That 's a great little army your guys have out there . Great tactics . A classic . Anytime you have another idea , chaplain , let me know . " " Right , " said the adjutant . " Right . " After the movie Gershon started back to his quarters in the rain . He went carefully up the path . Guards patrolled the wire fence perimeter . They wore ponchos and moved slowly . He found John Meron inside writing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie , chappy ? " " Not bad . I like Sinatra . " It was late . He began to get out of his clothes . " This bed will be a pleasure tonight . " " Were n't those Turks something ? The last time we went out , the colonel had his wallet slickied right from under his pillow while he slept . " " I did n't know that . " " They even slickied one of my fiancee 's letters . With these guys for allies , who needs enemies ? Bless the Turks . " Gershon yawned . " Have they ever hit the compound ? " " Not since I 've been here . I 'd like to see them try it . " " Boy , am I sleepy . " " What 's that ? A good luck charm ? I always meant to ask what that was . " " Yes . An old man in my synagogue gave it to me . " " Like a cross ? No . A Saint Christopher . " " Something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chappy ? " " Yes , John . " " Were you planning to go to Japan soon on R and R ? " " I 'm not due for R and R until about January . " " Do you think we might go together ? I do n't like going alone , and I do n't go where the others go . " " That 's a good idea , John . Let 's think about it seriously . " " Actually I have n't been to Japan yet . Not yet . " " Where did you go on your last R and R ? "  | " I have n't taken an R and R yet , chappy . " Gershon raised his head from the pillow . " I did n't want to go alone . I was a little afraid of the temptations . " " Well , we 've got to get you to Japan , John . We 'll work it out . " " The new chaplain . I heard his father is Charles Leiden . " Gershon looked at Meron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember who told me . " " Yes , he is . " " Wow . Charles Leiden . Does the chaplain know any physics ? " " He studied physics at Harvard . " " Then he got the call ? " " Something like that , John . Boy , I ca n't keep my eyes open . I 'm sorry . I could n't sleep out in the field . " " I started out in physics and then switched to engineering . I could n't keep up with the brainwork . Did his family  --  did his family know Albert Einstein ? " " Yes . He used to call him Uncle Albert . " " Really ? My God ! Uncle Albert . " " Good night , John . " " Good night , chappy . I 'll turn the light off soon . I 'm almost done with this nightly . " " The light does n't bother me , John . I 'm used to the light . " " Uncle Albert . My God . " The next morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't necessary for you to tell the whole world who Chaplain Leiden 's father is . " The assistant 's face reddened . " I thought you were the quiet type , Howard . " " I 'm proud of who he is , sir . " " Let him tell it . All right ? " " Yes , sir . " " I never would have taken you for a talker , Howard . What do I have this morning ? A character guidance lecture at recon ? " " Yes , sir . His father saved my brother 's life , sir . I love my brother . You know how many times my mother and father and I have thanked Einstein and Szilard and Oppenheimer and Fermi and Teller and Leiden and all those who worked on that bomb ? My  | father had a special prayer of thanks he made up for them the first Yom Kippur after the war . I was a kid . I watched him cry in the synagogue . I remember it , sir . I remember it like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , my father , as he thanked all those scientists for making the bomb and ending the war . He even made up a prayer thanking President Truman . You want to hear how those prayers went ? " " No . " " I remember them . I memorized them . " " Howard . " " Yes , sir ? " " Get the jeep . " " Yes , sir . " " And stop talking about Chaplain Leiden 's family . " " Yes , sir . " During the period of the field alert , France and England had invaded Egypt . Paratroops had been dropped outside Port Said . Naval ships shelled the city . Commandos stormed ashore . The city surrendered . Tanks headed for Suez City . Eisenhower , in the midst of his campaign for reelection , was enraged by the war . The Russians , who had just invaded and subdued Hungary , now threatened military intervention in the Middle East . In the field Gershon had sensed all about him the dread of oncoming atomic war . British troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suez Canal when London decided to accept the United Nations cease-fire demand . But no troops would be withdrawn . This was November 6 . The battalion had returned from the field , but all knew they might be alerted again at any time . In the officers club there was subdued talk of the next war . Skippy named it Atomic War One . " How long do you think it would last , colonel ? " he asked . " About three beers , lieutenant . " " That short ? " " Maybe four . " " Atomic War One . A four-beer war . I wish the Middle East would  | go away . Stuart . Oh , Stuart . Here you are . Save me four beers for the war . " The first indication of the strange trouble came after the service on the Friday evening in the second week of November , three days after the cease-fire . Gershon 's previous assistant , Gabriel Rosen , once again a hospital orderly , came over to him during the social hour and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to tell you this , chaplain . I heard it from others too . We got a big problem . " Gershon 's distaste for Gabriel Rosen had not diminished with time or-distance .. Others . stood around listening . " The-dews-are .. - beung .. bl.amed for. - starting- a world war , chaplain . There 's a lot of bad feeling-around ' - ' " Has anyone else heard this ? " Gershon asked . Others had heard it . Two days later Howard Morten said in the jeep on the way to the infantry regiment in the hills , " There 's talk in the battalion and in recon , sir . I heard it myself . Bad talk . The Jewish men do n't know how to answer . They do n't know why the Israelis started the war . " " Do you know why , Howard ? " " I 'm not sure , sir . I do n't know anything about politics . " " Is it anti-Semitic talk ? " " Yes , sir . Everyone is afraid of an atomic war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to go over the mountains or across the river ? " " When did it rain last ? " " The day we got back from the field . " " Take the river . " The next morning Gershon called Arthur . " How are you , Arthur ? How goes it in the mountains ? " " It 's terrible , " he heard Arthur say in a muffled voice . " What 's the matter ? Ca n't you hear me ? " " I hear you fine . This place is very strange . Everyone is walking around like it 's the end of the world . Have you been out to the field ? " " Yes . We were alerted again this past Saturday morning . We packed up and were ready to go , but the alert was canceled. "  | " Everyone here thinks there 's going to be an atomic war . I keep getting funny looks . A lot of people are avoiding me . Your assistant has a big mouth , do you know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have an assistant and a jeep ? " " I 'm set up . I found an assistant . A very quiet type . I do n't like nosy people . " " I remember . " " Can you hear me ? " " Yes . " " I do n't want to talk too loud . You can hear me ? My assistant tells me there 's a lot of anti-Semitic talk going on around the division . Because of the Israelis and the war . Do you have anything like that where you are ? " " Yes . " " I 'm not going to worry about it . I just wanted you to know . I 'm not used to having almost no one talking to me , dear Gershon . I 'd like to hit your assistant in the mouth . Listen , is there any chance I might get to Japan before January ? " " No . Arthur , can you meet me in Seoul tomorrow ? In the Jewish chapel . Around noon . " " Tomorrow ? What for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this anti-Jewish feeling . " " What 's there to talk about , Gershon ? " " Arthur , unless you have a very important previous appointment or you hear from me to the contrary by four-thirty today , let 's meet in Seoul tomorrow . " " All right , dear Gershon . Tomorrow . It will be worth it for the kosher lunch . " Gershon called the chaplain in Seoul . Yes , there had been some vague talk , the chaplain said cheerfully . Nothing to be concerned about . Tomorrow at noon ? A meeting ? Why not ? Happy to host the two of you . What was wrong with the new man ? A strange fellow . Moody . Tomorrow . Fine , fine . Meron said to him in their quarters that night , " My fiancee writes t hat everyone back home is scared , chappy . " " Everyone is scared everywhere , John . " " I wonder how that new chaplain feels . "  | " That bomb ended the Pacific war , John . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want the Israelis to let themselves be bled to death by all those raids ? " " I do n't know . But it may be the end of the whole world , chaplain . The whole world . " It rained that night , and in the morning the main supply route oozed with mud . Clouds covered the tops of the hills . Roadside streams had risen in the rain . Vehicles splashed mud onto his jeep . He rode in the rain and mud to Seoul . The streets were wet and crowded with traffic . He rode warily through Seoul now , always remembering the cart and the runaway horse . Near the train terminal were the hordes of scrofulous beggar children . The city looked dismal in the cold rain . He felt chilled and sensed a sudden oncoming vision . He closed his eyes and immediately saw a hill and two graves and a towering sand-colored stone wall . Sunlight shone on the wall from a blue sky . There were bare , rolling hills and a hot yellow wilderness . He opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was that snow ? Yes . A wet snow was falling . It fell briefly , slanting and splattering against the jeep . He closed his eyes again but saw only reddish darkness . The snow was gone by the time they turned into the Seoul compound . He stepped from the enclosed jeep and felt a cold wind on his face . The chapel was warm . He was greeted cheerfully by the chaplain , whose name was Solomon Geiger . Gershon sat in the lounge drinking hot coffee . He heard a jeep stop outside . Arthur came in . " Hello , " Chaplain Geiger said . " Both young warriors have now arrived . Can I get you a cup of coffee ? We can have lunch if you want . I have a fresh salami . Or I can heat up some chicken . " They sat in the lounge , eating and talking . Arthur said little . His flaxen hair was cut short and seemed stark beneath his small dark skullcap . He was restless . He looked ungainly in his boots and uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assure you , " Chaplain Geiger was saying with a smile . He was a middle-aged , balding man with a paternalistic air . A permanent aura of cheery optimism had been stamped upon him like Lincoln on the penny . " It will pass . I 've seen it before . Ignore it . "  | " The men are telling me they ca n't ignore it , " Gershon said . " Do n't make so much of it . What do you say , Chaplain Leiden ? " " I 'm new here , " Arthur said . " Right now I 'm listening . " " I think , " Gershon said , " that each of us should have a service in a different place each night of Chanukah and use the occasion to talk about the reasons for the war . " Chaplain Geiger said , " Now , now , I do n't know if that 's wise , Gershon . Is it wise , do you think ? The President disapproves of the war . The Secretary of State disapproves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen , there 's a lot of bad talk out there . Our men should be told how to respond to it . What do you think , Arthur ? " " Whatever you say , Gershon . You know more about this than I do . " They talked at length about the schedule of services and what they would say . " I will cover Seoul and Pusan and Inchon and I Corps , " said Chaplain Geiger . " I have n't your sense of urgency , Gershon . I do n't enjoy running around this place . I 'm not even sure I want to go to Japan . Maybe once . Maybe . Stay put and be safe . Would you like another coffee ? Be careful what you say about the war . A soldier does not criticize his Commander in Chief . Be careful . " Some time later they stood in the doorway of the chapel . Chaplain Geiger shook their hands effusively . " A safe trip . Is n't this weather terrible ? Tell your boys to drive with care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought I knew the name . Come back soon . Yes , yes . I will send the schedule of Chanukah services to Eighth Army . Yes . " Gershon walked with Arthur to where their assistants waited with their jeeps . " Are you all right , Arthur ? You are n't sick , are you ? " " I feel terrible , but I 'm not sick . How can you stand him ? He 's so cheerful . " " I do n't have to stand him , Arthur . I only have to work with him . " " It will take me a week to recover from this meeting . I have a need to retch . " " He is n't that bad , Arthur . " " No one has a right to be that cheerful , dear Gershon . Not in this world . "  | " Is there anything you need up in division that I can help you with ? " " Yes . Get me to Japan . " " What is this with you and Japan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a moment . They stood in the rain outside the chapel . " I want to see it , " he heard Arthur say as if from very far away . " I 'm tired of the sand and the burned earth . I need to see it . " Gershon stared at him . " Arthur . " Arthur Leiden blinked rapidly . " Yes , " he murmured . " Yes . What can you know about it , for Christ 's sake ? " He shook his head and looked at Gershon . " Do you think we might be able to go to Japan together ? " " I do n't see how , Arthur . " There was a brief silence . The rain fell upon them hard . " Will we be meeting here often ? " Arthur asked . " I do n't know . It 's a good idea to keep in touch . " " I 'll see you . " " Take care of yourself , Arthur . " Gershon watched as Arthur 's jeep pulled away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Morten call . " It 's pouring . " They rode back to the battalion in the rain . It rained the next day too . He rode along the winding mountain passes to the artillery battalion and saw a Jewish soldier who had been caught in a village with a Korean girl . The soldier was nineteen years old and from Detroit . He sat wretchedly on a chair and talked to Gershon . " They hate me , chaplain . They 're going to throw everything at me . " " Could n't you wait until you got to Japan ? These villages are diseased . " " My sergeant is an anti-Semite , chaplain . He hates Jews . He 's going to throw the whole thing at me . " " Sure , " Gershon said . " I 'm telling you , chaplain . It 's true . "  | " Everyone is an anti-Semite . Right ? " " My God , what am I going to tell my family back home ? " " I 'll see what I can do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP 's caught him , chaplain , " the sergeant said . " I sweet-talked them out of it before . I ca n't do it no more . " Gershon rode back to the battalion in the rain . On the way he stopped at the regimental library on the nearby infantry compound . He found the Henry Smyth book on the development of the atomic bomb by the American government , and took it out . He had read it quickly two years back . He wanted to read it again . In one of the regimental Quonsets he talked to a young Jewish soldier from Omaha . " What did you think you were doing ? " " I do n't know . " " That was a direct order . How could you disobey a direct order ? " " I do n't know why I did it , chaplain . " He was short and paleskinned , with dark hair and a caged look . " I hate this place . " " You do n't hate it enough . You were confined to the compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did you leave the compound ? " " They 're after me because I 'm Jewish . The captain hates Jews . " " Really ? What do you think your family will tell you when they find out about this ? Do they also hate Jews ? " The boy stared miserably at the floor . " They 're going to put me in Leavenworth , chaplain . Oh my God , my God . " " I 'll see what I can do , " Gershon said . Late that afternoon the rain stopped . The air grew suddenly icy cold . The muddied earth and puddles of rain began to freeze . The earth cracked and snapped beneath vehicles and boots . Gershon came out of his room and started wearily down the hill toward the officers club . The door to the officers club swung open . The division chaplain stepped out and let the door close behind him . He saw Gershon on t lie path and came quickly toward him . " They told , meyouu were here , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He had .... taot wanted to tell it to him over the phone , he said .  | Gershon stood there staring at him . A jeep went by on the road , breaking the frozen surface of the earth . He called Arthur and-the Jewish chaplain in Seoul . He packed a bag . Very early the next morning Howard Morten drove him to the division- airstrip . An L-2o Beaver took him from the airstrip to Kimpo . His emergency orders  --  carried through the chain of command by clerks whom he knew by their first names and cut for him at an odd hour of the night  --  got him immediately on a C-rr9 flight to Tachikawa . He sat silent and numb in that boxcar of an aircraft , the roar of the twin engines deafening . In Tachikawa he waited two hours and was put on board a Military Air Transport Service DC-6 . Somewhere beyond Wake Island he gained a day . He landed in Hawaii in humid , daylight and in San Francisco in chill - darkness . He flew through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the starkly familiar streets of the neighborhood . He rode in a dreamlike trance . It was early morning . The broken streets were littered with filth . He saw the burned and boarded houses . The odors of mildew and decay filled the hallway of his house . He let himself into the silent apartment . He put his bag dowdy in the living rQotn . The apartment was cold . The living room seemed a closet . His cousin stared at him from the photographs on the end table . He thought he could hear the distant barking of a dog . In the small kitchen he sat awhile at the table over a cup of coffee and a buttered roll . The walls badly needed painting . He went into his room . The bed , the dresser , the bookcase , the desk , the chair . Pale morning light filtered through the edges of the window shade . The room was very cold . There were cracks in the paint on the wall near his bed . He could not remember those cracks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An aura of submissive despair clung to the apartment like a foul scent . Some minutes later he let himself silently out of the apartment and went down to the basement . He went past moist and grimy walls to the furnace . It lay huge and black , its bowel a bed of white ashes and faintly glowing coals . He shoveled into its mouth fresh coal and stepped back from the flames . He leaned a moment on the  | handle of the shovel and gazed at the fire . Then he went back to the apartment , washed his hands and face , lay down on his narrow bed , and fell asleep . His aunt woke him . She held the robe tightly about her . He had called her from San Francisco . He rose from the bed and held her and felt the quivering of her fragile form . She- wept , dried her tears with the sleeve of her robe . How pale he looked , she murmured in her whispery voice . How thin . No , he was well , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en could they go to the hospital ? He sat with her at the kitchen table and watchid- r ? eat a breakfast of cooked cereal and coffee . Her hands trembled . She had aged a decade in a year . Outside , the street was coming slowly to life : cars , schoolchildren , a man 's voice raised in a shout . They took the subway and walked along a wide boulevard in cold gray air to the hospital . There in a room with five others lay his uncle amid tubes and tanks and hovering orderlies . He felt the sudden surging beat of his heart and looked away , unable to endure this vision of torment . Then he looked back , and in that moment his uncle opened his eyes and gazed at him . The face chalk-white , the goatee wispy and white , the skin wrinkled and papery , the eyes pale and filmy in bluish pools  --  he had seen that face everywhere during the past months ; they were faces that had gazed so long at emptiness that even despair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it , felt its dry bony warmth , its feeble clutching . The hand fell back ; the eyes closed . In the corridor the resident said they would know in a day or two , it was touch and go , he was in very serious shape , lungs filled with fluid , heart erratic , very serious . He seemed surprised at Gershon 's detailed probings into medical procedures and peered for clues at the insignia on his uniform . His aunt stood at his side in shriveled dread . They returned home in the afternoon . Their Shabbat dinner that evening was eaten in silence . He lay in his room and listened to the radiator dying . In. the synagogue the next morning a prayer was said for his uncle 's recovery . The old man who had taught him Aramaic came over to him after the service . Gershon had the amulet , yes ? He wore it , yes ? He himself id- not believe in such nonsense . But how could             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
