S T OR Y THE VIEW OF ME FROM MARS By Lee K. Abbott Aweek before I became a father , which now seems like the long ago and far away that fairy tales happen in , I read a father-child story that went straight to the surprise one truth between children and parents is . It was called " Mirrors , " and  --  to the twenty-three-year-old would-be know-it-all I was  --  it had an end that literally threw me back in my chair ; an end , sad somehow and wise , which held that it is now and then necessary for the child , in ways mysterious with love , to forgive the parent . In " Mirrors " the child was a girl , though it could have been a boy just as easily , whose father  --  a decent man , we have to believe  --  takes her to the sideshow tent at a one-horse and one-elephant circus in the flatlands of Iowa or Nebraska or Kansas . She 's seven or eight at this time , and  --  as we have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see now , our misfortune to receive  --  she begs and begs to see the snake charmer and the tattooed lady , the giant and the dwarf . He gives in , the girl decides much later , because of his decency ; or he gives in , as my own father might say , because he 's too much a milk-and-cookies sort of fool to understand that in that smelly , ill-lit tent is knowledge it is a parent 's duty often to deny or to avoid . It is a good moment , 1 tell you , this moment when they pay their quarters and go in , one person full of pride , the other sucking on cotton candy , the Lee K. Abbott is the author of Strangers in Paradise . He is currently working on a collection of short stones . sad end of them still pages and pages away . In that tent a whole hour , I think walk-ing from little stage to little stage , the girl is awestruck and puzzled and , well , breathtaken , full of questions about where these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're not standing in front of a bunch of hayseeds and would it he possible to get a face , a tattoo , printed on her knee ? " Can I touch ? " she asks . " Do they talk ? " A spotlight comes on , blue and harsh , and beneath it , in a swirl of cigarette smoke and field dust , are two little people , Mr. and Mrs. Tiny , gussied up like a commodore and his society bride ; another light snaps on , yellow this time and ten paces away , and there stands a man ? " A boy , " the barker tells us , " only eighteen and still growing ! " ? who 's already nine feet tall , his arms long as shovels , nothing in his face about his own parents or what he wants to be at twenty-five . These are clich  --  s , my smart wife Ellen Kay tells me ( " Sounds too artsy-fartsy , " her exact words were when I read the thing to her ) . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man pass by  --  the girl Christmas Eve impatient , the man nervous  --  before they come to the main display , a young woman , beautiful and smooth as china , who has no arms and no legs . The father , complaining that he 's grubby-feeling and hot , wants to get out , but his daughter , her heart hammering in her ears , ca n't move . As never before , she 's conscious of her own hands and feet , the wonders they are . She 's aware of smells breath and oil and two-dollar cologne ; and of sounds  --  a gasp here , a whisper there , exclamations that have in them ache and horror and fear . " C'm on , " the father says , taking her elbow . But onstage , businesslike as a banker , the woman ? " The Human Torso , " the barker announces , " smart like the dickens " ? is drinking water , the glass clamped against her neck by her shoulder ; is putting on lipstick ; is writing her name with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to type  --  using her chin maybe  --  a letter to a Spec 4 serving the army in Korea , her boyfriend . Outside , the midway glittering and crowded with Iowans going crosswise , the girl , more fascinated than frightened ( though the fright is coming ) , asks how that was done . The father has a Lucky Strike out now , and the narrator  --  seven or eight but on the verge of learning what will stay with her until seventy or eighty  --  realizes he 's stalling . He 's embarrassed , maybe sick . He says howdy to a deadbeat he 'd never otherwise talk to . He says he 's hungry , how about a hot dog , some buttered popcorn ? He 's cold , he says , too cold for September . " How ? " she asks again , pulling at his sleeve a little and watching his face go stiff and loose in a way that has her saying to herself , " 1 am not scared . No , I am not . " And then he says what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often not  --  for all thereafter that astounds or baffles and will not be known : " Mirrors , it 's done with mirrors . " There 's a pause here , I remember , six sentences that tell what the weather is like and how , here and there , light bulbs are missing and what the girl 's favorite subjects are in school . " What ? " she thinks to ask , but does n't . " It 's an illusion , " he says , his voice squeaky the way it gets when he talks about the money they do n't have much of . " A trick , like magic . " Part of her  --  the part that can say the sum of two plus two , and that " A " is for Apple , " B " is for Boy  --  knows that mirrors have nothing to do with what she 's seen ; another part  --  the half of her that will remember this incident for ever and ever  --  knows that her father , now as strange to her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is working up and down , and his expression says , as lips and eyes and cheeks will , that he 's sorry , he did n't mean for her to see that , she 's so young . Something is trembling inside her , a muscle or a bone . One-Mississippi , she says to herself . Two-Mississippi . Over there sits a hound dog wearing a hat and somewhere a shout is going up that says somebody won a Kewpie doll or a stuffed monkey , and up ahead , creaking and clanking , the Tilt-a-Whirl is full of people spinning round and round , goggle-eyed . Her father has a smile not connected to his eyes  --  another lie  --  and his hand out to beold and also about forgiveness , I am the father to be read about and the child is my son Stuart Eliot Polk Jr . ( called " Pudge " in and out of the family ) ; he 's a semi-fat golfer ? " Linksman , " he insists the proper term is  --  and honor student , who will at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cease to be a citizen in the sideshow tent my big house here in El Paso now clearly is . Yes , forgiveness  --  particularly ironic in that , since my graduation years ago from Perkins Seminary at SMU , it has been my job to say , day after day after day , the noises that are " It will get better " and " We all make mistakes " to a thousand Methodists who aim to be themselves forgiven and sent home happy . There is no " freak " here , except the ordinary one I am , and no storybook midway , except my modem kitchen and its odd come-and-go. 1 am an adulterer  --  an old-fashioned word , sure , but the only one appropriate to the ancient sin it names ; and my lover  --  a modem word not so full of terror and guilt and judgment as the other was , until two dayS ago , Terri Ann Mackey , a rich , three-times-married former Zeta Tau Alpha Texas girl who might one day make headlines for the dramatic hair she has or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every way likable and loud and free-minded , she has , in the last four years , met me anywhere and everywhere  --  in the Marriott and Hilton hotels , in the Cavern of Music in Juarez , even at a preachers ' retreat at the Inn of the Mountain Gods near Ruidoso in southern New Mexico 's piney forests . Dressed up in this or that outfit she sent away for or got on a trip to Dallas , she has , to my delight and education , pretended to be naughty the way we imagine the Swedish are or nice as Snow White ; she has pretended , in a hundred rented rooms , to be everything I thought my wife was not  --  daring and wicked , heedless as a tyrant . Shameful to say , it seems we have always been here , in this bright desert cow town , now far-flung and 50 percent tickytacky , drinking wine and fornicating and then hustling home to deceive people we were wed to . Shameful to say , it seems we have always been playing the eyes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pew in the middle of St. Paul 's , me in the pulpit sermonizing about parables and Jesus and what welfare we owe the lost and poor and beaten-down . " Yes , " my wife Ellen Kay would answer when I told her I was at the Stanton Street Racquet Club playing handball with a UTEP management professor named Red Walker . " Go change , " she 'd say , herself as lovely and schoolgirl trim as the one I 'd collapsed atop a half hour before . " I phoned , " she 'd say . " Mrs. Denbo said you were out . " Yes , I 'd tell her . I was in the choir room , hunting organ music that would inspire and not be ho-key ; I was in the library , looking up what the Puritan Mathers had written about witchcraft and gobbledygook we are better off without ; I was taking a drive in my Volvo , the better to clear my head so I could get to the drafting of a speech for the Rotarians or the Lulac Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard , " she 'd say , " let 's go to Acapulco this year . " And I 'd head to my big bedroom , the men I am , the public one amazed by his private self  --  the first absolutely in love with a blonde , Continental-history major he 'd courted at the University of Texas in 1967 ; the second still frazzled by what , in the afternoon , is made from deceit and bed noise and indecency . And , until two days ago , it was possible to believe that I knew which was which , what what . " Where were you ? " Ellen Kay said , making ( though too violently , I think now ) the tuna casserole I like enough to eat twice a year . " Icalled everywhere , " she said . " It was as if you did n't exist . " Upset , her hair spilling out of the French roll she prefers , she said more , two or three paragraphs whose theme was my peculiar behavior and the sly way I lately had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not ; and suddenly , taking note of the thump-thump my heart made and how one cloud in the east looked like a bell , I stood at the sink , steadily drinking glass after glass of water , trying to put some miles between me and her suspicions . Terri Ann Mackey Robinson Cross was all over me , my hands and my thighs and my face ; and a giant step away , my wife was asking where I 'd been . " You were going to call , " Ellen Kay said . " You had an appointment , a meeting . " I had one thought , which was about the bricked-up middle of me , and another , which was about how like TV this situation was . " I talked to Bill Watson at the bank , " she said . " He has n't seen you for a week , ten days . I called ? " And her wayward husband had a moment then , familiar to all cheaters and sorry folks , when he thought he 'd tell the truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-D vision of the cheap world he 'd have to live in , when he thought to make plain the creature he was and the no-account stage he stood upon . " I was at the golf course , " I said , " watching Pudge . They have a match tomorrow . " The oven was closed , the refrigerator opened . " Which course ? " she said . Forks and knives had been brought out , made a pile of . " Coronado Hills , " I said . " Pudge is hitting the ball pretty good . " She went past me a dozen times , carrying the plates and the bread and the fruit bowl , and I tried to meet her eyes and so not give away the corrupt inside of me . I thought of several Latin words  --  bellus and verus and fatum  --  and the Highland Park classroom I learned them in . " All right , " she said , though by the dark notes in her voice it was clear she was going to ask Pudge if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have stood next to , applauding the expert wedge shot I 'd seen with my very own eyes . As in the former story of illusions and the mess they make crashing down , there is a pause here , one of two ; and you are to imagine now how herky-jerky time moved in our house when Pudge drove up and came in and said howdy and washed his hands as he 'd been a million times told . You are to imagine , too , the dinner we picked at and our small talk about school and American government and what money does . While time went up and down , I thought about Pudge the way evil comic-book Martians are said to think about us : I was curious to know how I 'd be affected by what , in a minute or an hour , would come from the mouth of an earthling who , so far as I knew , had never looked much beyond himself to see the insignificant dust ball he stood upon . I saw him as his own girlfriend , Traci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft-spoken about everything except golf and how it is , truly , a full-fledged sport . Part of me  --  that eye and ear which would make an excellent witness at an auto wreck or similar calamity  --  flew up to one high corner of the room , like a ghost or an angel , and wondered what could be said about these three people who sat there and there and there . They were Democrats who in a blue moon liked what Reagan did ; they had Allstate insurance and bank books and stacks of paper that said where they were in the world and what business they conducted with it ; they played Scrabble and Clue and chose to watch the news Dan Rather read . The wife , who once upon a time could run fast enough to he useful in flag football , now used all her energy to keep mostly white-collar rednecks from using the words " nigger " and " spic " at her parties ; the son , who had once wanted to be an astronaut or a Houston brain surgeon , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win the Masters in Augusta , Georgia ; and the father , well , what was there to say about a supposedly learned man forwhom the spitting image of God  --  who was up and yonder and everywhere  --  was his own father , a bent-over and gin-soaked cattle rancher in Midland , Texas ? I hovered in that corner , distant and disinterested , and then Ellen Kay spoke to Pudge , and 1 came rushing hack , dumb and helpless as anything human that falls from a great height . " Daddy says you had a good round this afternoon , " Ellen Kay began . " You had an especially nice wedge shot , he says . " She was being sneaky , which my own sneaky self admired ; and Pudge quit the work his chewing was , a little confusion in his round , smart face . He was processing , that machine between his ears crunching data that in no way could ever be , and for the fifteen seconds we made eye contact , I wanted him to put aside reason and logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his lip he had a crumb that , if you did n't tell him , would stay until kingdom come ; I wanted him to stop blinking and wrinkling his forehead like a first-year theater student . The air was heavy in that room , the light coming from eight directions at once , and I wanted to remind him of our trip last summer to the Phoenix Open and that too-scholarly talk we 'd had about the often mixed-up relations between men and women . I had a picture of me throwing a ball to him , and of him catching it . I had a picture of him learning to drive a stick shift , and of him so carefully mowing our lawn . Oddly , I thought about fishing , which I hate , and bowling , which I am silly at , and then Ellen Kay , putting detergent in the dishwasher , asked him again about events that never happened , and I took a deep breath that I expected to hold until the horror stopped . Here is that second pause I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the eve needs to look elsewhere to see what is ruined , what not . Pudge now knew I was lying . His eyes went here and there , to the clock above my shoulder , to his mother 's over-watered geranium on the windowsill , to his mostly empty plate . He was learning something about me  --  and about himself , too . Like his counterpart in " Mirrors , " he was seeing that I , his father , was afraid and weak and damaged ; and like the invented Daddy in that story , a Daddy whose interior life we were not permitted to see , I wanted my own child , however numbed or shocked , to forgive me for the tilt the world now stood at , to say I was not responsible for the sad magic trick our common backand-forth really is . " Tell her , " I said . 1 had in mind a story he could confirm  --  the Coke we shared in the clubhouse , a corny joke that was heard , and the help I tried to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , two days ago , a father cold and alone and small . ?
