MEPHISTO <P> Directed by Istvn Szabo Screenplay by Istvn Szabo and Peter Dobai <P> The subject could not be more serious : an actor 's gradual betrayal of political , not to mention moral , principle in return for professional advancement in Nazi Germany . The style could not be more surprising . One has come to expect material of this kind to be set forth in a tone of grim and stately foreboding . Instead , Mephisto , a Hungarian-German coproduction that richly deserved its Oscar as this year 's Best Foreign Film , moves with a feverish back-staginess , a rushing , unbalancing energy that not only freshens one 's historical imagination but finally forces the viewer to turn in on himself , trying to determine whether , in similarly tempting circumstances , he would have done better than its protagonist , Hendrik Hfgen . <P> Hendrik is a minor actor correctly convinced that he is harboring a major talent-and desperate to the edge of hysteria to escape the provincial stages of his early years . He is discovered in his dressing room throwing a tantrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happily drowning in the applause he pathetically needs and will do anything to get . Do the Communists , with their workers ' theaters and cabarets , offer him showcases ? Very well , he will be a Communist . Does a rather distant and chilly woman offer him social advancement and a way into Berlin 's better artistic circles ? Fine , he will marry her and quietly send for his mistress once he has settled into his new career in the capital . Do the Nazis flatter him , indulge him and eventually offer him the directorship of a great state theater ? All right , he will reshape his famous performance as Mephistopheles in Faust to suit their totalitarian purposes . They represent , as far as he can see , no more than the next step in his irresistible rise . At first , they even let him intercede on behalf of old friends who have fallen into their disfavor . <P> Hendrik is not inherently evil . Indeed , in Klaus Maria Brandauer 's person , he presents a rather open and innocent face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the victim not so much of calculation as of a failure to calculate . He appeals before he appalls . He really can not see , until the end of the story , the difference between the Nazis and everyone else with whom he has leagued himself to get ahead , can not imagine the dire consequences of ambition unmediated by , among other factors , simple common sense . <P> Poor Hendrik ( yes , a terrible sympathy for him does creep in ) . He can not even distinguish between acting on a stage and making appearances for the party at public functions . Both are , after all , performances , to be relished for the gratifying attention that is focused on him . Many actors have had fun and won admiration by playing bad actors . Few have dared what Brandauer accomplishes : showing us a good actor responding to the same neurotic drive for the center of the stage , the immortalizing role . His is a great performance , nothing less .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
