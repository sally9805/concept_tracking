Face to face with Reagan , Mondale makes his case <P> Ronald Reagan thought he had saved his best shot for last . He reminded voters that as a challenger in 1980 , he had asked Americans , " Are you better off than you were four years ago ? " and that they had answered by electing him President . Now , he said , the question should be " Is America better off than it was four years ago ? " The answer , he said , " has to be yes . " <P> It was a hard point to rebut , but Walter Mondale was ready with an answer : " The real question is will we be better off ? Are we better off with this arms race ? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt ? " <P> For weeks , Mondale had lagged so far behind Reagan that he was barely within shouting range . But finally last Sunday night in Louisville he was on the same podium , eight feet away from Reagan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certainly , his last , best chance to turn a runaway election into a close contest again . Just by being on the same stage with the President , by holding his own and indeed by scoring significant points , Mondale not only avoided a knockout blow , he helped his cause . <P> To what extent will not be known for days , perhaps not until Nov. 6 . Mondale appeared poised and prepared , and even showed flashes of the humor that he is capable of but has rarely displayed during the campaign . Surprisingly , he was more at ease than the President . Most important , he was able to give his candidacy a coherence and theme that had not been readily apparent on the campaign trail . Reagan did not appear to do himself any serious damage , but he seemed somewhat hesitant and occasionally became tangled up in facts and figures . He lacked , for once , his uncanny ability to rise above the details of governing and strike overarching themes . <P> On the stump , Mondale has not had much success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday night he aggressively pressed Reagan for his " plan " to deal with the problem . " President Reagan takes the position the deficit will disappear by magic , " scoffed Mondale . Reagan insisted that he would not raise taxes , and that the recovery would produce the needed revenues to close the budget gap . Reagan charged , " I do n't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget . He has a plan for raising taxes . " But at moments the President seemed defensive . He insisted that high interest rates were not caused by rising deficits , an assertion , Mondale pointed out , that did not square with the views of many of Reagan 's own advisers . <P> One of the sharpest areas of disagreement came on the emotional issue of abortion . In attempting to tackle the question of whether the decision should be a matter of personal choice , the President asserted , " Is n't that what a murderer is insisting on , his or her right to kill someone ? " Mondale argued that abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in which Government should play no role . " Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment ? " he asked , raising as he did three times in the debate the specter of the influence claimed by the leader of the Moral Majority .
