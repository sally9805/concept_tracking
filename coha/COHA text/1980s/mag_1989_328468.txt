One way to become the leader of a country is to organize a coup . Another is to get elected . General Andres Rodriguez , 65 , has done both in the space of three months . Last week Rodriguez , who in February overthrew dictator Alfredo Stroessner after a 34-year rule , became President in Paraguay 's first contested election in 61 years . <P> Since the coup , Rodriguez , a longtime top aide to Stroessner , has sacked 34 hard-line army generals , relaxed censorship and legalized eight political parties . Some opposition figures questioned the strength of Rodriguez 's victory ( 74% ) , but no one seriously doubted he had polled more votes than his opponents . Although the Rodriguez-led Colorado Party captured 72 seats in the Congress , for the first time in decades the remaining 36 will go to a truly independent opposition .
