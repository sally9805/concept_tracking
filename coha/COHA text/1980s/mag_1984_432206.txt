 | U.S. combat troops have long since departed . The guns have fallen silent . American military posters taunting the Marxist-led enemy have vanished . Yet nine months after U.S. forces invaded this sparkling little island in the West Indies , the American presence still is strong and still popular . Some of the signs painted on walls by villagers are fading , but their good will shines through : " God Bless America " and " Thank God for U.S. and Caribbean Heroes of Freedom . " Grenadians , who welcomed the U.S. invaders last October 25 with garlands of flowers and baskets of food , no longer are so openly demonstrative . However , they continue to insist that the Americans saved their lives in the chaotic aftermath of a hard-line Marxist coup . Most also insist that the Americans should stay on to provide security and boost the island 's ailing economy . Overwhelmingly , Grenadians shrug off the minor manifestations of discontent that are starting to crop up in this former British colony . Several spraypainted slogans on a hill outside this capital city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nearby islands ? the Caribbean Peacekeeping Forces ( CPF ) ? to go home . So far , these few signs are confined to a leftist stronghold . But less visible indications of frustration also are surfacing , and they are not so easy to ignore . Colin Dathorne , a Grenadian accountant , explains : " We thought the invasion was great , that now everything would get fixed . But after nine months , some people are asking , What 's going on ? ' It 's not hostility . It 's just disappointment in not seeing things done straightaway . " Expectations remind some people here of the popular movie , " The Mouse That Roared , " in which a tiny country wants to lose a war to the U.S. in order to receive large sums of money and aid . U.S. aid has , in fact , bolstered the economy , improved roads and water supplies and created hundreds of jobs . But 13,000 Grenadians , 30 percent of the labor force , are out of work . The interim government is slow to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far from certain . Says U.S. Charge d'Affaires Loren Lawrence : " Grenadians are asking us why problems are n't solved . We have to show them that problem solving is not ours or the Cubans ' or the Soviets ' to impose but something they must learn for themselves . " For their part , the Americans are learning that it is easier for a nation of 236 million to win a war in a Cubandominated country of 89,000 than it is to insure lasting peace . U.S. officials admit that they want Grenada to become a pro-American bastion of democracy in the region but maintain , in the words of one aide : " We 're not dictating to them . We 're offering advice . " Keeping low profile . The U.S. is even trying to play down its presence on this lush volcanic island that lies just 92 miles north of Venezuela . Marines no longer guard the American Embassy 's front gate at Ross Point . Grenadians are posted there , and the Marines stay inside the compound . GI 's patrol the island in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops from such neighbors as Jamaica , Barbados and St. Lucia . U.S. forces wear sidearms but do not carry other combat weapons . Nevertheless , it is as hard for the U.S. to be inconspicuous on an island just twice the size of the District of Colum- bia as it is to sneak a 60,000-ton battleship into a yacht basin . Americans number only about 650 : Some 270 military personnel , 266 students at the St. George 's University School of Medicine , 15 American missionaries , 4 Peace Corps workers and an additional 100 U.S. residents , including 35 diplomats and Agency for International Development ( AID ) staff members . The U.S. presence , though , is very obvious . Two Coast Guard cutters watch the harbors . A few miles to the south , three large Black Hawk helicopters and two smaller choppers stand like enormous metal grasshoppers amid cows and sheep in a pasture surrounded by sandbags and coils of concertina wire . In early morning and late afternoon , the helicopters drone over the island , aiding CPF patrols or delivering mail , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choppers gleam brightly on floodlit helipads . Their field is near the Grenada Beach Hotel , which the U.S. Army has turned into its command headquarters . At one time , the 180-room hotel was the island 's largest resort . Islanders : " GI 's O.K. " For all its high visibility , the American military gets along well with Grenadians . " The GI 's pass by here all the time , " says Joseph Sandy of Concord , a mountain village north of St. George 's . " We love them . " Lt. Col. Earl Horan , the base commander , says local reaction to his troops " has been remarkable , the best I 've ever seen in a foreign country . " No serious incidents have occurred just a few catcalls at Marines and a brief tussle in which a military policeman was shoved by two Grenadians who were angered by the arrest of a friend on drug charges . American soldiers and citizens mix freely in restaurants , shops and at Saturday-night dances . One soldier has married a local woman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here will be phased out starting next March as a Grenadian police force , trained by the British , becomes capable of maintaining order . American troops could be off the island altogether by October , 1985 . In early June , the U.S. resumed work abandoned by the Cubans at the Point Saline international airport . Americans once feared the 9,000-foot runway would become part of a Cuban military base , but now they view it as essential to the revival of tourism and foreign investment in Grenada . The airport , with 21 million dollars from the U.S. and 6 million dollars from Canada , already is bolstering the local economy . Some 275 Grenadians have been hired , many at salaries 50 percent higher than the Cubans paid , and 25 or so more workers will be added in the next few weeks . Target for opening : Late October . Islanders feel the U.S. presence in other ways . Hundreds have received temporary jobs on such AID-funded projects as patching potholes on 190 miles of roads , repairing a telephone exchange near the Grenada Beach Hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To upgrade local health care , AID is funding a 1.5-million-dollar campaign by Project HOPE , the nonprofit medical-teaching organization , to train doctors , lab technicians , public-health nurses and other medical workers . Because local doctors lack certain surgical skills , HOPE doctors themselves are operating on patients , something they ordinarily do not do . In trying to pump up the economy directly , the U.S. has given 5 million dollars to the local Advisory Council , Grenada 's interim government until elections are held this fall . The council used the funds to pay civil servants and cover debts . Also , the Americans have spent about 1 million dollars to compensate citizens and business owners who suffered property damage from U.S. forces during the fighting in October . Despite such help , the economy remains in shambles . The interim government , admits Chairman Nicholas Brathwaite , is still hard put to meet its payroll at the end of each month . It has no money for public works . Most of the 2,000 youths who had served in the previous government 's Army have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grenada ? and the U.S. Tension is high on the island . Many Grenadians still hide weapons in their homes , fearing that a newly elected government will be as repressive as the last two . U.S. and Caribbean forces have confiscated about 250 weapons since March . Fall elections possible . American officials and local business leaders agree that tourism and foreign investment will remain stagnant until the island has a stable elected government . Yet two thirds of islanders polled in January and 43 percent of those polled in May said elections should be put off a year or two . Hotel owners and the chamber of commerce urged Brathwaite to delay balloting at least until spring . But Brathwaite insists on early elections , and they are expected in October or November . Grenada 's turbulent past plays a key role in the current politicking . A British colony from 1783 to 1974 , it was led by Sir Eric Gairy in its first five years of independence . Gairy , says one Briton , " had enormous support because he raised workers ' wages and broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the economy sagged . Gairy confiscated property , used his personal armed force , the Mongoose Gang , against political opponents and urged the United Nations to study flying saucers . In 1979 , while Gairy was at the U.N. , a group of hard-line leftists , the New Jewel Movement , seized power . Its leader , Maurice Bishop , set up a People 's Revolutionary Government ( PRG ) . His Marxist regime moved close to Cuba , the Soviet Union and Libya .  | The PRG confiscated more property , closed newspapers , jailed dissidents . Bishop , says one business leader , " made Gairy look like a priest . " Last October , an extremist faction within the PRG overthrew Bishop , killing him and several of his supporters . The Army fired on a crowd of citizens and imposed a 24-hour curfew . Riots and looting were widespread . At that point , to restore order and to keep the island from falling completely under Cuban domination , the U.S. launched its invasion with about 7,300 American troops and 300 policemen from nearby islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cubans . All U.S. combat troops were withdrawn by December 15 . Mistrust and suspicion abound in the wake of last fall 's trauma . During the PRG days , young people were taught to spy on their parents , and family members often turned against one another . Today , many people are reluctant even to discuss politics . Nine parties are vying for 15 seats in the new Parliament . The winning party or coalition will name the Prime Minister . So far , the most organized group seems to be the Grenada United Labor Party ( GULP ) headed by Gairy , who returned to the island in January . Gairy has revived his mysterious image by rarely venturing outside a pink house on a hill overlooking the jadeand-blue harbor here . His followers troop up the hill daily to see him . " I have a divine mission to uplift this country , " Gairy says . He will not run himself , he adds , but expects one of his GULP members who wins a seat to step aside . That would allow Gairy to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become Prime Minister . Gairy , 62 , who draws his following from the elderly and farm workers , is said to have hard-core support of only about 15 percent of voters . However , if leaders of opposing parties can not coalesce , analysts here say , he may win by picking up much of the undecided vote . The U.S. , says one American official , would be " severely embarrassed " if Gairy won . Another warns : " A Gairy victory would fly in the face of everything we 're trying to accomplish " and would force the U.S. into " a serious reevaluation of its position . " But the Americans stress that they can not try directly to influence the outcome . " If we do , " explains one , " we 're likely to screw up . " The leftists , remnants of the Bishop organization , are in disarray . Says one , George Louison : " I do n't know if we 'll even field candidates . " Centrist coalition ? U.S. officials hope that two moderate candidates , Herbert Blaize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat Gairy . Blaize , 66 , headed the government twice in the 1960s before independence . Brizan , a 41-year-old educator and economist , claims wide support among the young . None of the major candidates has detailed his programs . Gairy describes himself as a " liberal conservative . " His campaign material proclaims him " the only real leader in Grenada . All others are Communists . " Blaize stresses that when he led the government , Grenada had peace and economic growth . Brizan pledges to end political favoritism and " tolerate differing political views . " In late July , Blaize and Brizan were arguing over how many seats each would control in a coalition government . " Logic cries out for them to get together , but logic does n't always hold sway in politics , particularly here , " says one diplomat . Since January , the White House has touted investment opportunities here . Hundreds of business owners have asked for more data , and 30 or so have come for a firsthand look . But only a few actually have set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face numerous other difficulties . Telephones frequently do not work . Many roads still have more potholes than flat surface . Electricity is a sometime luxury . Water supplies are so inadequate that toilets go unflushed and showers untaken . When it rains hard ? and it often does ? everything goes out of order at once . A New York lawyer representing some developers recalls : " There were no lights and no water , and I could n't even telephone anyone to complain . " U.S. and local officials contend that such problems will ease as more of AID 's two-year , 57-million-dollar fund for Grenada becomes available . Some AID money was halted for more than a month in the spring because Congress wanted details on certain projects . Investors say they also are frustrated by the slow pace of the interim government . Charges Richard Gray , a local hotel owner : " This government makes reports , not decisions . " Gray and others insist that Brathwaite should move faster to issue new tax and investment codes . But Brathwaite argues : " These are complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , for a few American investors , Grenada is worth the effort . Says Bill Ingle , a Virginia toy manufacturer who is setting up a factory here : " The people are friendly , hard working and intelligent . Also , we are getting tax and duty concessions from both the U.S. and Grenada . " Adds Ben Vernazza of Aptos , Calif. , whose plant workers fill jars with whole nutmegs , graters and recipes : " I see a chance to help the people of Grenada and make money at the same time . " For the U.S. , this tiny island is a big gamble . America already has invested more than 1 billion dollars in the October war and the continuing military and civilian operations here . " Grenada is very important to us , " a Washington official admits . " We 're not about to let it slip away . " For their part , many Grenadians regard the U.S. effort as the island 's last chance , and they are becoming impatient to see a rapid turnaround .
