Everybody is grabbing a piece of California 's movie action <P> To Californians it was perhaps the ultimate insult . In an effort to lure film production eastward , the state of Florida took out an ad in show business trade papers with an illustration of one of the most famous sights in Southern California , the hill that displays the giant sign HOLLYWOOD . But where those nine letters should have been , an artist had superimposed seven different ones : FLORIDA . " Hollywood weather without Hollywood overhead , " read the caption below . <P> What was particularly galling was that there was a certain amount of truth in the gibe . As film making in Southern California has become more expensive and more difficult , other states have moved aggressively to capture a business traditionally synonymous with Hollywood . " We 're losing the feature-film business , " declares Maureen Kindel , president of the Los Angeles City Board of Public Works . " It 's as simple as that . It 's a lucrative , non-polluting and glamorous industry , and other states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " <P> Ten years ago , a large proportion of major American pictures were produced in California . In 1981 only half were made there , and in the past two years the number has dwindled to about a third . In fact , of 42 films shooting in the U.S. last week , only nine were being made in California . For the stars , who can find work anywhere , the exodus from Hollywood means little . But for thousands of film technicians and journeymen performers it increasingly signals mass unemployment . According to a study by the Los Angeles Film Development Committee , the state 's economy lost $1.6 billion to other states between 1979 and 1982 through cutbacks in movie production . <P> The state that has gained the most is New York . New York City has long been a film center in its own right , and now has a one-third share of U.S. movie production . In 1983 , 66 movies were shot there , including The Pope of Greenwich Village , Ghostbusters and Francis Coppola 's The Cotton Club . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City has been host to 42 films , among them Garbo Talks and Falling in Love with Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro . The next two busiest states are Texas and Florida . Although Florida Governor Bob Graham 's goal is to make the state the film center of the world within 20 years , Texas , where 30 feature film and television productions were shot last year , appears to have as good a chance of becoming the " third coast . " <P> There are several reasons for the flight from California . One is the trend , which has been growing since the early 1960s , to use authentic locations , guaranteeing that the camera is actually where the script says it is . Director Mark Rydell opted to shoot the upcoming film The River in Tennessee because he wanted real local color . " Though great things get created on studio back lots , the East does look different from the West , " says Barry Levinson , director of Diner , which was shot in Baltimore , and The Natural , which was made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that has changed with better communication , new methods of distribution , lighter cameras and smaller crews .
