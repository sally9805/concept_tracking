For more than three decades , as the frozen mass hurtled along its lonely path , the distant star had grown bigger and brighter in the blackness of space . Now the icy wayfarer was picking up speed , and the star had become a shining yellow sphere , its intense light illuminating the planets circling it . Basking in the rays of the star , the approaching comet warmed , giving off vapors that formed a growing cloud around it . And in the brightening light , the cloud began to glow . <P> For inhabitants of earth , the third closest planet to the star , the long- awaited spectacle had begun . After a 75-year sojourn through the solar system , Halley 's ( rhymes with valley 's ) comet had again swung into view , but just barely . At Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson one night last month , several large telescopes tracked the approaching comet , projecting images that flickered across television monitors . But like countless amateur stargazers around the world , the astronomers wanted to see the cosmic celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air outside an observatory dome , necks craned , binoculars raised , they and a group of visitors searched a patch of sky . <P> " I 've found it ! " somebody cried . " Where ? Where ? " a chorus responded . One of the astronomers gave directions , as though to an out-of-the-way restaurant : Begin with the Pleiades , a glittering cluster of stars known as the Seven Sisters , then look south to find two middling bright stars , then move half a binocular field to the northeast . <P> And there it was . The sight , however , was decidedly unspectacular . Because it was still too far from the sun to sport a visible tail , and 58 million miles away from earth , the comet looked like little more than a smudged and dusty fingerprint . Or , as Hyron Spinrad , a cosmologist from the University of California , Berkeley , declared , " It 's a wimp . " Still , everyone was delighted . For the skywatchers , the appearance of Halley 's was a once-in-a- lifetime event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even spiritual landmark . Said Astronomer Susan Wyckoff of Arizona State University in Tempe : " Just to see it at all is a thrill . " <P> But for astronomers and other scientists , the thrill goes far beyond a squint through an eyepiece on a shivery night . Although experts warn that Halley 's latest go-round  --  or apparition , as they call it  --  could be the dimmest of the 30 visits in recorded history , from a scientific standpoint it will be nothing short of the Fourth of July . Next March , as Halley 's speeds toward its closest approach to earth , it will be greeted by five diminutive , instrument-crammed space probes , two launched by Japan , two by the Soviet Union and one by the eleven nations of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . The close encounters were set for March because that is when the comet passes through earth 's orbital plane , the same level in which the spacecraft travel . Over several whirligig days , the flotilla will scrutinize the comet in exhaustive detail , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two tails that by then will be streaming for millions of miles behind it .
