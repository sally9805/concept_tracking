Several new releases try a freer portrayal of homosexuality <P> " There 's nothing more inconvenient than an old queen with a head cold , " Toddy sniffles as he contemplates being down and out in Paris , 1934 . He has just lost his job in a gay nightclub , his lover has left him , and his new roommate , Victoria ( Julie Andrews ) , is a singer with a voice that can shatter glass but not the indifference of booking agents . <P> Toddy , who is played with great good spirit by Robert Preston , speaks too soon . For the old queen is anything but an object of pity . Since his new pal looks so dapper in the suit she borrows from him after her clothes have been ruined in a rainstorm , he shrewdly conceives the idea of having her become a female female impersonator : in other words , a woman who plays a man playing women . <P> Things get really delirious when James Garner , as a determinedly heterosexual gangster from Chicago , falls for her/him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he finally embraces her . " I do n't care if you are , " he replies . As he squires her around , the world is bound either to mistake him for a homosexual or learn the truth about her , which will destroy a very promising career . To further complicate matters , the gangster 's bodyguard ( sweetly played by former Detroit Lions Tackle Alex Karras ) , encouraged by what he takes to be a conversion by his master , comes out of the closet and starts an affair with the ever amiable Toddy . <P> In short , by the end of Victor/ Victoria , Writer-Director Blake Edwards ( " 10 , " The Pink Panther series ) has managed to overturn virtually all his characters ' sexual roles and the audience 's expectations as well . He has also made , in the midst of much well-timed farce , a fairly serious point : namely that sexual identities have precious little to do with the qualities , moral and otherwise , that make people good , attractive or fun to be with . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Edwards film ( S.O.B. ) , Victor/Victoria adds further proof that , like Toddy in the film , homosexuals are ceasing to be an inconvenience to moviemakers . Already out and doing quite well in the theaters is Making Love , in which a terribly nice fellow ( Michael Ontkean ) leaves his terribly nice wife ( Kate Jackson ) to take up with a not-quite-so-nice novelist ( Harry Hamlin ) before he finds a more stable male mate . Also doing well is Personal Best , which purposely makes no big deal about the fact that its two leading figures ( played by Mariel Hemingway and Patrice Donnelly ) indulge in a lesbian affair while pursuing their careers as Olympic-level track athletes . <P> Making Love is a case of the bland leading what its creators consider to be the blind . Says Director Arthur Hiller of his highly sanitized love scenes : " We were n't trying to say this is how gays make love . This is terribly new for most of the country , so you must lead them into it gently . " As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his film 's identification as a gay tract . " The name of the movie is not ' Personal Fruit . ' There are two minutes of lovemaking and an hour of competition in it , and as far as I know , sex between any genders has not yet qualified as an Olympic event . "
