 | Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine is so shy about his personal life that he wo n't tell interviewers how many children he has . He is equally reticent about his professional career . " He 's not out for the spectacular , " says a colleague . " He works hard and he knows he 's doing a good job other people ca n't do . " Starzl , in truth , is a superstar of surgery : one of the very few men capable of transplanting the human liver . The slender , dark-haired surgeon performed the first liver transplant while he was at the University of Colorado Medical School in 1963 . Of the 400 liver grafts performed since , he has done more than half . Considering the fact that 4,600 kidneys were transplanted last year in the United States alone , these figures do n't seem imposing . But of all organ transplants , none is more formidable than Starzl 's surgical specialty . Success : Thanks largely to Starzl 's pioneering techniques and methods of followup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has improved steadily . The first time a patient survived for more than a year was in 1967 . Today , 75 percent of liver recipients can expect to live that long , and of those who do , 85 percent survive at least another four years . About 30 of Starzl 's patients have lived more than five years and one for twelve . The pinkish , triangular liver is the largest of the body 's internal organs and the most varied in its functions . It acts as a filter for toxic wastes and dead blood cells . It synthesizes glucose for energy and manufactures most of the enzymes needed for the complex chemistry of the body . It also makes such key blood proteins as albumin . " The liver is the center of metabolism , " says Dr. Shun Iwatsuki , one of Starzl 's surgical colleagues . " If it fails , nothing works . " Transplanting a liver presents a monumental problem of logistics and surgical skill . Unlike the kidney , the liver does n't come in pairs and therefore ca n't be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recently deceased donor and implanted within twelve hours . About 80 or 90 " organ procurement " centers , linked by computer , keep tabs on patients who require livers and match them with suitable donors . Starzl spends almost as much time traveling to check out a potential liver for transplantation as he does in the operating room . The surgery itself is far more intricate and time-consuming than the transplantation of a kidney or a heart . " It 's a Herculean effort , " says the 55-year-old Starzl . The case of Lauren Toohey , a 21/2-yearold New Jersey girl with liver cancer who had a transplant last month , illustrates what Starzl means . Word of Lauren 's plight was spread by the news media , prompting the parents of 4-year-old Robert Newberry , who was dying of meningitis at Kenosha , Wis. , Memorial Hospital , to offer his liver . As soon as the boy was declared dead , Starzl was tracked down at a medical meeting in New York . He caught a helicopter at La Guardia Airport for a small airport in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private jet ride to Pittsburgh . While Lauren was admitted to Children 's Hospital for preparation , Starzl and three of his colleagues continued on to Kenosha . Starzl and his team removed the Newberry child 's liver , determined that it was normal and suitable for transplant , called Iwatsuki and told him to get Lauren ready . With the donor liver packed in an ice chest , Starzl 's group flew back to Pittsburgh . By.s the time they arrived , Iwatsuki had made an incision in Lauren 's abdomen . He had made sure that Lauren 's cancer had not spread to ' other internal organs , which would have made the transplant pointless . Had this been the case , a 9-year-old Dallas girl ? waiting in a nearby room ? would have received the liver . " With livers so scarce , you do n't want to take such a valuable organ and not be able to use it , " says Starzl . Lauren had been chosen over the other child because she was more gravely ill . Difficult : The surgeons first removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key arteries , veins and bile ducts and the ligaments that held it in place , a process that took three hours . They then spent the next five hours at the tedious task of locating and tying off thousands of " collateral " blood vessels . These arise spontaneously in patients with serious liver disease that blocks the flow of blood through the portal vein . Many of them lie clustered in the layer of fat between the skin and the muscle of the abdominal wall , making the job more difficult . But each must be closed with a suture to prevent serious bleeding Finally , the surgeons installed the Newberry child 's liver and connected it to the blood vessels and ducts of Lauren 's body . The chief problem Lauren now faces is the possibility that her body will reject the new liver . Starzl is a pioneer in the development of drugs to prevent organ-transplant rejection . He formulated the combination of prednisone and Imuran in the early years of his work and then added a serum called antilymphocyte globulin designed specifically to attack the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high doses of prednisone , a steroid hormone taken by transplant patients , have posed such serious side effects as softening of the bones and a proneness to possibly fatal infections . Last year Starzl showed that a new drug called cyclosporin A works so well that the prednisone dosage can be reduced to even a tenth of the previous level . In Transit : Starzl is indefatigable . The same weekend he operated on Lauren he performed another liver transplant and two kidney transplants . When he is n't in the operating room , in the lab or in transit to find a donor organ , he breezes down the hospital corridors looking in on his patients . " I feel like a new man , " says Bruce Caton , a 34-year-old hospital aide who underwent a liver transplant last month . One patient of ' Starzl 's is n't so grateful . Little Lauren Toohey , standing in her crib in a blue nightgown dotted with red clowns , scowls when Starzl enters her room . " She just does n't like doctors , " her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
