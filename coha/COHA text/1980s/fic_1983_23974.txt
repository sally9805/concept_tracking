54 N THESE months Daniel Quinn was reconstituting his youth out of restlessness with a maturity that would not hold . Twenty-five years earlier , when he read what Hemingway wrote about giving up the vanity of clothing ( under the influence of Ecclesiastes ? ) and with the money saved having bought Picassos and Braques , Quinn left off buying clothes for their own sake . He accumulated no Picassos and could not say where the money went that did not go to the clothiers . Perhaps he bought more Hemingway or saw more films or drank more Jameson 's . Certainly he rid himself of the unseemly wardrobe , He wore out the chocolate brown gabardine , the tan Palm Beach , the gray sharkskin with the one-button roll . And when the trousers of his blue serge double-breasted thinned at the seat , he converted the jacket to a blazer , adding buttons the color of burnished bronze , and wore it sparingly for the next twenty-five years , its splendid resistance to death by time or moths proving to be a symbol of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed Quinn 's age for at least fifteen years , though he made no secret of it . His hair had not gone gray , his face had developed no lines or furrows that revealed a ravaged spirit . Yet he moved through these days with a growing sense of drift and dejection that contravened the rewards due those who successfully fend off the pillaging of years . Without knowing why , but sensing that his decision of a quarter century ago had been misguided , he once again gave willful attention to clothing as a way of restructuring that mood of certainty , that pleasure in being well dressed to meet life , that had existed so vitally before the Hemingway-Ecclesiastes axis cleaned out his closet . He now read the men 's fashion section of the Sunday Times magazine , questing for an image that transcended that of rumpled slug but halted this side of fop . He browsed in the shirt and suit departments of Brooks Brothers on a trip to the city and came away depressed at the irrational price of traditionalism . He bought a Yugoslavian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch William Kennedy 's most receni novel is Ironweed , published by Viking . pockets , but was two months accumulating the money to take it out of the store . Then at the yearling sales in Saratoga with Maud and the Penningtons he found himself fixating on the compelling attire of a man of affluent girth who was oh-so-quietly bidding on a bay filly whose worth had rapidly ascended to six figures and was now moving toward seven . " Who 's bidding ? " Sissy Pennington asked . " Do you see anyone ? " " I do n't , " said Quinn as he tried to scan the crowd face by face but found in it only the qualities that made so many of the people similar . There were more men with short blond hair , pulled away from the temples but falling from the crown with a soft flourish , and more men with blazers , half-glasses , and neckties ( all the men , all of them , wore neckties ) , than is numerically normal for any gathering of humans under a single roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hemisphere of money across Union Avenue from the racetrack . The similarities Quinn saw in the spectators , all of them here because they belonged here , impeccable credit their common bond , seemed now to be comparable to racial characteristics . They were as alike as a roomful of Japanese technocrats or Portuguese fishermen . The more they stalked singularity the more they resembled the common image that lurked in every one of their chiffoniers . " I hope they do n't catch me raising a finger at the wrong time and bill me for three hundred thousand , " said Fred Pennington , who had worn his blazer for the occasion , unaware how properly he was dressed . Quinn wore a pale blue seersucker jacket with a wine stain on the lapel that the cleaners could not eradicate , a white dress shirt whose collar was ( still unnoticeably ) beginning to fray , and a pair of classy six-dollar Italian shoes Maud had found in a sale on Fourteenth Street . " You could wave like a cheerleader , " Quinn told Fred . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't look at you unless you 'd established your credit with them . " " How do you know that ? " Maud asked him . " I know about credit . " " You know about not having any , " said Maud . " Negative knowledge is also knowledge , " said Quinn . HEY HAD known the Penningtons since before they all married . Quinn and Fred made the first connection , comrades in the city room after college for a year of reporting and after-hours carousing that was quick-drying cement for a lifetime friendship . Quinn remained a writer , obsessed still with the past and its mysteries , and had reaped a few of the rewards and ironies such a life offers . Fred had aspired to poetry before he met Sissy and it nagged his spirit after marriage . In the grip of a psychic fit he quit his job when the McDowell Colony offered him two months of summer literary retreat in rural New Hampshire . He decided he would need no more purified time than that to compose one unarguably sanctified poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when September came and the muse had finked out , he took a job with International Currents , an electronics magazine , and without poetic distractions he rose like an astronaut into a cosmic editorship which in time allowed him to buy the former Saratoga residence of the VanCleeveBatesons ( aluminum ) , and never mind the price . The auctioneer in the Finney Pavilion sat with his assistant in the middle of the arena on a high perch around which the grooms walked the yearlings . The floor of the promenade area was covered with green sawdust and policed by a spavined little black man with a Douglas Fairbanks mustache , a shovel , and a rake , working the racist end of the horses , rushing their regal droppings out beyond the glass doors where they sent up a thoroughbred reek into the starry August sky . Four spotters stood anxious watch for the understated signals of the bidders as the auction proceeded , but Quinn watched only the spotter a few feet in front of him , a portly man whose head was bobbing with spastic professionalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yuh , " clearly in response to the bidder Quinn could not find . " Will you give me seven hundred thousand , " the auctioneer was saying in his machine-gun lingo , " gimmaree gimmaree gimmaree seven hundred thousand now seven hundred tholisand I 've got yes gimmaree gimmaree gimmaree yes seven hundred and twenty gimmaree ... " " Yuh . " " I see him , " said Maud . " Third row , fat . " The bidder sat next to a dark-haired woman in a white dress and pearls , who sat beside a blonde with hair pulled away from temples in a soft flourish . The man , in blazer and necktie , was fifty-five , indisputably fifty-five , golden half-glasses riding low on his nose . He nodded , ever so imperceptibly , but a nod , and Maud giggled , and the spotter said " Yuh , " and the auctioneer said , " Seven hundred and seventy-five will you gimmaree eight hundred , gimmaree gimmaree ... " The bidding man wore a handsome shirt with 55 dark blue stripes and gold cuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches beyond the blazer sleeve . He also wore a blue and white polka-dot tie , which Quinn took to be a standard variation of the uniform of the day , though he had never seen the combination before . The combination should not have succeeded . It was an arrogant combination , absurd . In his most aggressive time Quinn would not have put polka dots with stripes . Quinn felt distanced from taste . He would be an also-ran on any best-dressed list . One needed imagination to keep up , to defy the taboos , to override the cluckings of critics and fuse polka dots with stripes stylishly , heroically . " I 've got nine hundred and forty , will you give me a million ? " said the auctioneer . " Another sixty is all it needs and this horse has a better record than Genuine Risk had at the same age , how about just a little more ... " The bidding man gave the spotter a negative move of his left hand and the spotter 's head paused in the silence . " Yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavilion . " I 've now got nine hundred and fifty , will anyone say a million ? Gimmaree gimmaree ... " The bidding man nodded , the least perceptible nod of the night , for Quinn almost missed it . " Yuh , " said the proximate spotter . " Well bless my soul , " said the auctioneer . HE PENNINGTONS chose to sleep late and so Quinn and Maud went alone to the morning workouts at the track . They sat across from one an-other in the clrbhouse watching Eddie Maple ride up the track and back again on Genuine Risk , and though neither of them would have recognized jockey or mount had the announcer not identified the noted presences , they felt satisfied that the morning had brought them into the realm of such high achievers . " I had a vivid dream last night , " Maud said when the waiter took away their plates . " Do you want it analyzed ? " " No , I just want to tell it . " " It 's after breakfast . It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . " " Was I in it ? " " Would I leave you out ? I was at the foot of a mountain and up the slope this glorious music was playing . You have no idea . I ca n't ever remember any music in a dream before . I went up a long path , though I knew I should n't . I needed permission but I could n't find anyone to ask , and the music was so glorious . I wish I could tell you what it was like . And then in this high place I could see them making the music . " " What were they making it with ? " " I do n't know that . " " Who was making it ? " " I could n't see their faces . It was on another mountain . You could n't get there from where I was . Then I was in a restaurant showing you how I could hold an abstract piece of cake in front of my face without touching it . It just hung there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You asked me how I did it and I said it had to be windy . " " I like the abstract cake , " Quinn said . " The wind 's not bad , but easy . " " Then we were in the Bronx , someplace very poor , and people had iron gates on their windows . I said to you , ' Is n't it amazing what crime has done for the iron gate industry ? ' " " Was I amazed ? " " I think so , and I saw a woman in the window who was so shabby , so very , very shabby , and I told you how glad I was we did n't live here . We started to leave and you were sitting on the curbstone reading the newspaper and you said , ' Do n't forget the turtle .

He was in high school , very young , and he was playing marbles in the living room . " " What living room ? " " Where we first lived , over the garage . " " Did you play marbles too ? " " No , " said Maud . " Why not ? " " It 's not my game . " ? HAT . EVENING when the Penningtons gave a party on the porch and lawn of their summer place on the shore of Saratoga Lake , Maud disappeared . Quinn walked down to the lake to look for her and saw that the Pennington boat was gone . He looked along the shore and in the distance saw the silhouette of a man and a woman holding one another at the waist , their faces close but not touching . Was it Maud ? From the tilt of the head it seemed not . Quinn looked back toward the splendid Pennington house , built near the site of an old landmark restaurant where Henry James once had memorable tea , and he saw that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading into shadow , curled in upon itself in an unnatural but graceful way , and he could not say whether this was d  --  j ? vu or the work of a frangible imagination . He saw Sissy Pennington standing alone by the outdoor bar and he remembered what James bad said of the Saratoga ladies : that they adorned themselves elegantly , but to so little purpose . Sissy was never Less than regal in her attire and her carriage , but she was too bright to take her regality seriously . Quinn walked to her and mixed himself a small scotch and water . " I see you 're having a swell time , " he said . " I 'm resting between conversations about horses . I often wonder what it would have been like if Fred had kept on with the poetry . " " You 'd be talking about horses as symbols . " A cluster of guests sat on lawn chairs in deep shadows beneath three grand trees . The others were on the porch , all of them growing dim with the drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward with acute clarity , Cesar Monteflores 's above all . He was a sinewy Dominican horsebreeder , a sleek-haired and handsome man with a silver incisor that gave a metallic glint to his remarks . Quinn had met him and his fetching young wife at the yearling sales the night before . He was now inquiring resonantly : Has anyone seen Carmen ? Has anyone seen my wife ? And it brought quiet to the porch . Cesar bounced down the steps , peered into the cluster of faces in the shadows , and elicited shakes of the head and nos to this question . Then he saw Sissy and came toward her . " I have n't seen her , " Sissy volunteered . " Where is your husband ? " asked Cesar . " Where indeed ? " " Are they together ? Juntas ? " " I suppose it 's possible . " " If he is with her , that maricOn , I will cut out his heart . " " He no longer has a heart , " said Sissy . " And if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have nothing to worry about . " Cesar walked down toward the shore calling his wife 's name : " Caaaarmen Caaaaaaaaaaaarmen Caaarmencmunta , " the mournful cry of a hound in unassuageable grief . Quinn and Sissy said nothing , nor did they move . They watched Cesar dart in and out of the shadows of the shoreline trees , and then they watched him come back toward them , the machismo in his stride now at full brim . " I know they are together , " he said to Sissy . " I saw how he was whispering to her . He is having her and I demand my honor be preserved . I demand you give me the same satisfaction . ! guar , you understand ? And give it to me now , ahora mismo . " " That 's not how we do things up here , Senor Monteflores , " Sissy said . " We have different customs . If Fred really carries it off I could make you a baked Alaska . Do you like baked Alaska ? Or I could let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think that this is no joke , " Cesar said , inhaling his outrage . " I am dishonored in your home , " " Our hostess has nothing to do with your dishonor , if such it be , Mr. Monteflores , " Quinn said . " Her husband is n't with your wife . He 's with my wife . " " How do you know this fact ? " " I understand the customs . " " He is with your wife and it gives you no import ? " " They 're first cousins , " said Quinn . " It 's like royalty and thoroughbreds . You keep it in the family whenever possible . " Cesar Monteflores snorted and walked back into the house and past the silent guests . The talk then resumed on the porch and in the shadows beneath the trees , a grove of honey locusts . Y HERO , " Sissy said to Quinn . " I 'm all for facing the reality , " said Quinn , " even when I do n't know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maud ? " " / believe in the possibility of the unlikely . " " But you do n't feel dishonored . " " On the contrary . I demand satisfaction . " " When ? " " Now . We 'll go for a swim . " " Why did n't I think of that ? " Sissy said , and together they walked toward the lake . They walked along the shore to the small sandy cove where the four Pennington children swam with their friends in daylight hours , a safe , shallow harbor without algae or neighbors . Quinn and Sissy hung their clothes on the low branches of a birch tree and walked into the water together , Sissy wearing a bikiniesque transparency . " How do you expect me to banish my dishonor if you do n't take that thing off ? " Quinn said . " Do you really want to start this ? " Sissy said . " It 's been years . " " I like to keep my options open , " said Quinn . And so Sissy stepped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together they swam out into the warm , black water until it was over their heads . They splashed around on their backs , swam in circles , and then swam to where they could stand up . They held one another then , almost in the same way , Quinn noted , that the couple on the shore had embraced earlier . " I remembered your breasts quite accurately , " Quinn said . " In this light I ca n't be sure of the color , but I was right about the shape . " " The color is still white , but they 're no longer the shape you remember , unless your memory has also sagged . " " They 're quite beautiful . " " Do you really , really , really want to do this , Quinn ? " " I have n't decided . " " I 'm not sure I want to . " " It 's better not to be sure . When you 're sure of everything you turn out like Cesar Monteflores . Be grateful for your uncertainties . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think so too . " " Let 's go sit down and talk about this . " HEY SAT together underneath their clothing and looked at the moon and the summer stars and the scattered lights along the far shore . Quinn stared at Sissy and then stroked one of her breasts , testing his tactile memory against the real thing . He decided she had grown softer with age . They had loved intensely but briefly during the summer Fred courted his muse in New Hampshire . " I think Fred plays with women now and then just to prove he has n't died and gone to the vault of the Chase Manhattan , " Sissy said . " I do n't want to talk about Fred , " said Quinn . " I suppose I do n't either , " Sissy said . Then she kissed Quinn lightly , a deft but soft-lipped kiss that slowly grew fervent . They then reconstituted the ritual in the style that neither of them had chosen to forget . " I 'm being a terrible hostess , " Sissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear me complaining , " said Quinn . " They 'll miss us , " she said . " They 'll say we 've gone off together . They 'll see our soppy hair and say we 've been swimming . They 'll ask if we wore our bathing suits . " " We can say we did n't go all the way in , that we only wet our heads . " Quinn did not want to return to the party yet . He stood holding Sissy 's hand , staring out at the lake , and realized he was watching the Pennington speedboat returning , its light gliding slowly along the surface of the water , moving toward the dock . They heard the motor die , saw the light go out , heard a rustle of voices . Quinn felt he could present Sissy with any question whatever and it would yield its mysteries . Sissy was brilliant of mind , body , and soul and he would not make love to her again for twenty more years . He sat beside her on the rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the abstract cake and the iron gates and him sitting in the gutter and the turtle and the basketball and Fred playing marbles over their garage and he ascribed meaning to most of the elements . " Maud wishes we were rich like you , " he said . " It 's not reducible to greed . She just wants that abstract cake . I think it 's brilliant how she invented that . " " What about the iron gates ? " " They keep people out . And in . " " And the basketball ? " " The basketball I do n't have yet . I do n't think it 's terribly important . It 's the turtle that 's the key . We saw this story about turtles on Charles Kuralt last Sunday . This great , monstrous sea turtle , this incredibly aged and mythic creature , venerable re-ally , lays her eggs on the beach and then sheds a giant tear as she goes back into the ocean . The people on CBS did n't know whether the tear was from her joy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids behind . I suppose physical pain is a possibility , but I prefer not to credit that . " " As you prefer not to credit the basketball . Do n't you really know what the basketball means ? " " I really do n't , " said Quinn . " Welt , I 'll never tell . " In YOU have a nice swim ? " Maud asked when Quinn and Sissy came into the kitchen . Her voice was full of champagne bubbles and rainbows . She was incomparably beautiful . " We had a lovely ride all over the lake , Fred took Carmen and Walter and me on the grand tour . We saw where Riley 's was and Cary Moon 's , which was all the rage a century ago , and we saw where the Whitneys swim and where Arnold Rothstein used to go wading in rolled-up trousers in the late afternoon . We saw where Victor Herbert almost drowned and ... " " It 's dark out there . " " It was still light when we left . And there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quinn asked . " She 's out on the porch , with Cesar . They 're quite a pair of lovebirds , those two . " " Quite a pair , " said Quinn , and in a voice that would not carry he said , " She did n't go with you . I saw her with a friend down by the lake . " " Sshhh , " said Maud , and in an equally conspiratorial whisper she said , " They came over to the boat when we docked and begged us to say they 'd been with us . " " Who is us ? " " Who do you suppose ? " Quinn looked from Maud to Fred , who was smiling and stroking Sissy 's wet and stringy hair , then to Walter , who was standing in the doorway to the living room , talking to Grover Milburn , a Mercedes-Benz dealer . Walter was an engineer , a partner in a titanium mining company that was headquartered in Montreal . He was perhaps thirty-five and his face had the raw power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed Quinn with her lips open , a meaningful statement . It resurrected his memory of their first kiss , the night when they met at a party in Frankfurt . Someone told Quinn she was German and that her name was Gisela ; and Maud spoke both languages so well that she convinced him it was true . In his usual way of validating the unreal , Quinn fell in with her game and rhapsodized over her name , finding in it echoes of Galatea and Gaea , Giselle and Gelsomina , Gioconda , Guinevere , and even the Gleipnir , which , he explained to her alone , meant that chain of wondrous things that once fettered an enemy of the Norse gods . The chain , Quinn said with an eloquence that stunned the young Maud and made her his that night and ever after , was made of a Siamese cat 's footsteps , the soft beards of yellow-haired women , the roots of round stones , the breath of small , golden fish , the nerves of female polar bears , and the spittle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and when he realized what she was now doing he knew he was again aboard a trolley , departing for the place from which he had just departed . But the trolley metamorphosed into a horsecar , and the horsecar into a stagecoach . And as people boarded , Quinn saw they were all dressed for their worst moments , ready for the road , flaunting their flaws , reveling in everything that made them freakish , When Maud boarded the coach , Quinn told her : " We 're going back , " and he meant to the age of his ancestral namesake who was shot in a love duel . The coach rolled past Maud 's city of iron gates and out into the new country where love was as sweet and soft as Maud 's small primeval bosom . The coach rolled smoothly along the dirt road behind a matched pair , and then curved upward toward a festive mansion whose manicured lawn suddenly curled in upon itself in an unnatural way that made the horses shy . But there was grace in the inward curve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist of the perverse . Later , in an upstairs room , after Quinn had sponged himself and was wrapped in his yellow robe , he stood by a window and stared down at a woman of the age , sitting with two men . He recognized one of the men as himself . The three sat beneath a trellis designed as a Romanesque arch , upon which grew the blue roses of longing . One inhaled these roses and understood the secrets of creative love . The woman under the arch , whose back was to Quinn , stood and disrobed , her arms and shoulders suddenly bare . The second man was helping her out of her only garment by holding a sleeve , while the seated Quinn imperiously studied what was being revealed to him . Quinn , accumulating meanings for the basketball in Maud 's dream , turned away from the window to confront her totality as she stood before him , her long hair flowing over her shoulders . She opened his yellow robe , and held him with exquisite nonchalance . Wrapped around her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its long , uneven ends falling the length of her torso to obscure part of her private hair . The visible hair was the color of caramel , the ribbon a deeper brown , the color of moist , fertile earth . Before Quinn 's eyes had made the gesture , Maud rolled backward onto the simple iron bed , her legs rising , the ribbon falling naturally between her open thighs , leaving her gift mostly secret . In her mouth Quinn encountered the taste of abstract cake .
