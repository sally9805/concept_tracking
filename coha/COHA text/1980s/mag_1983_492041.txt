Stefanie Powers is , today , one bJ of the most popular stars on television , which automatically translates into her being one of the best-known personalities in Amer  --  ica . At 40 , fame has been a long time coming for the costar of ABC 's " Hart to Hart " - 23 years in fact . " I think it 's a wonderful thing to be recognized after spending so many years working , " Stefanie smiles . " it gives you the confidence that you were n't so wrong . It not only heals the hurt , it kisses the spot and makes it okay . " If fame like Stefanie 's is rare , so , too , in a smaller way , is her back  --  ground . She is one of the very few Hollywood stars who was actually born there . Born Stefanie Paul , of Polish-Jewish descent , on Novem  --  ber 2 , 1942 , she spent some of her early childhood in England but had , otherwise , a pretty typical Holly  --  wood childhood for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a comment on the insularity of the film com  --  community that , when Stefanie was eight , she was attending the Panaieff Ballet Center , where class  --  mates included Natalie Wood  --  the future wife of " Hart to Hart " costar Robert Wagner  --  and Jill St. John , who has been linked roman  --  tically with Wagner since Wood 's tragic death a year ago . By then , she also had a nickname ? Taffy . She laughs , " My brother Jeff and there was a character on the show , a nurse , named Taffy Tucker . When 1 was little , I had freckles and bright red hair , and I guess Taffy Tucker did , too . Anyway , he started calling me Taffy . " Her film career began while she was attending school at Hollywood High and was cast in a dancing role in the movie version of West Side Story . " I got the job at 15 and was fired after three months of rehears  --  als , " she recalls . " They found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High ( where she loved science courses and was on the drill team ) in 1960 . Soon afterward , she landed a small role in Universal 's film Tam  --  my Tell Me True and leapt to a much larger role , playing Lee Rem  --  ick 's sister in Blake Edwards ' Ex  --  periment in Terror . Her work in this Columbia film led to a contract with the studio , where she starred in such movies as The Interns , Die , Die My Darling , McClintock , Escape to Athena and Stagecoach . She re  --  members , " I made 15 motion pic  --  tures in five years at Columbia , but toward the end , I was n't getting that much work , and I was restricted from doing television through my contract . When I was offered the starring role in NBC 's ' The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. , ' it seemed the best offer at the time . / bought out the remaining two years of my con  --  tract and did the series . " Coming on top of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have seemed like an incredi  --  ble opportunity , but neither it nor Stefanie 's second television series a decade later , " The Feather and Father Gang , " did much for her career . " Hart to Hart , " now starting its fourth season , changed all of that . Perhaps the show could best be de  --  scribed as a " light-hearted adven  --  ture-comedy " limning the exploits of Jonathan and Jennifer Hart , a married couple with millions to spare but who most enjoy solving crimes . What seems to be most ap  --  pealing about the show , according to viewer polls , is the chemistry be  --  tween Wagner and Stefanie , both of whom play thoroughly likable peo  --  ple . They have been friends since Stefanie did a guest spot on Wag  --  ner 's old series , " It Takes a Thief , " and the friendship between the two comes across on the show . The show , based on an idea by novelist Sidney Sheldon , was trans  --  formed into its present form through the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show as " executive creative consul  --  tant . " She recalls , " Tom turned ' Hart to Hart ' into what it is . There was only one person in his mind who could be Jonathan Hart  --  R.J. Wagner 's nickname . Then , some  --  time after getting his agreement to do the role , they started to look for the person to be his costar . The net  --  work did n't want me at all . R.J. and Tom insisted and took a very firm stand . I 'm sure if they had n't I would n't have been on the show at all . " Wagner agrees , " That 's absolute  --  ly true . I always believed that she would be perfect as Jennifer , and she was . We 've been together on the show a long time now and worked a lot together . I enjoy seeing her every day . She 's a consummate profes  --  sional . " Recalling the sorrow of the past year , Wagner adds , " I have the greatest respect for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 , Stefanie married actor Gary Lockwood , and as " The Girl from U.N.C.L.E . " had been can celled , she joined him in Spain where he was making a movie . While living there for a year , she developed her present passion for travel and learning about new things . The marriage to Lockwood ended in 1969 . In 1972 , at a tennis tournament at the La Costa resort near San Diego ( where she still spends weekends from time to time ) , Stefanie met William Holden , 25 years her sen  --  ior . The relationship blossomed after they met again some months later in a Beverly Hills bookstore , and in 1973 , she traveled to Hong Kong with him . The following year , she accompanied him on the first of her eight trips to Africa . There is no question that Africa dominated the last year and a half of Holden 's life . There is little ques  --  tion , either , that for the nine years remaining to him after meeting Stef  --  anie , she was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 1981 , from inju  --  ries suffered in a fall in his home . In his will , he left $250,000 to Stefanie , which she is using to bring his dream of a wildlife education center to reality . The William Holden Wildlife Foundation was founded to " carry on the ideas Bill distilled down during all of the time he spent in Africa , " Stefanie ex  --  plains . " Essentially it involves the establishment of a wildlife educa  --  tion center in Kenya , and its aim is , through enlightenment , to properly manage wildlife so it can cohabit with humans . " The point is that , since the humans encroaching on wildlife are n't going to go away , the only possibility for the survival of wildlife is to work out a modus vivendi between men and animals . The center is located on 15 acres of land donated from Holden 's 1,256-acre Mount Kenya Game Ranch , 125 miles from Nairobi . Among its facilities is an overnight youth hostel . The game park itself maintains breeding herds for ani  --  mals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spe  --  cies into the wild and , thrOugh its translocation project , has quite successfully moved entire herds of animals from areas where human pressure was becoming too great for survival . Stefanie is one of the directors of the William Holden Wildlife Foun  --  dation , which is headquartered in Los Angeles . She smiles , somewhat ruefully , as she reflects , " Bill and I collected lots of art together , particularly Southeast Asian sculpture . In the light of building the founda  --  tion , my collecting days are cur  --  tailed for a while . " After the Ken  --  yan facility is fully funded and . established , there are plans to establish a similar operation in the United States , but that is well in the future . Since Holden 's death , Stefanie has been linked romantically ( and inaccurately ) with a number of peo  --  ple . The fact is , there is simply no time in her life for romance . Unlike a show such as " Dynasty , " where there are a number of characters who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart " is Robert Wagner , Stefanie Powers and Lionel Stander ( who plays Max ) . While the show is filming , she works all of the time , and that means frequently getting up at five in the morning to meet a 6:30 call and getting home at nine or ten o'clock at night . Stefanie adds , " It 's very different working on television when you 're a woman . For example , you 're required to be at the set or location one hour before the men for makeup . And , as a woman , you have to get plenty of rest , because fatigue may be accept  --  able in a man 's face , but it 's certain  --  ly not acceptable in a woman 's . " This life and its demands make it quite nearly impossible to have a relationship with anyone . In order to have a relationship , a require  --  ment is that you be with the person , and there is simply no time . This is my choice , and we are all living our choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Travel is very important for her . She notes , " I do n't travel frivolously . Travel is an avocation , a way of life for me . When I travel , it 's like a school course . " And travel she does . Dur  --  ing the three months shooting hiatus for the show this year , she visited Hong Kong twice ( she owns an apartment there ) , Africa , Italy and China , where she had a chance to improve her proficiency in Manda  --  rin . She already is fluent in French , Italian , Spanish and Polish . Probably the most interesting choice , however , is her selection of a most non-Hollywood-like lifestyle . Despite a weekly income in the mid-five figures , not for her is the flashy , high-visibility star facade , with its gigantic homes , Rolls-Royces and endless parties . True , she owns two homes  --  one in Malibu and a more formal one in Beverly Hills , but both are comparatively modest by filmdom 's standards . She drives not a Rolls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is any , is usually devoted to her three horses , stabled at the Malibu house . " I love taking care of them , " she says hap  --  pily . " I have an Andalusian named Don Legaro and two Arabians , Kidogo and Citona . Citona I own in joint tenancy with Tom Mankie  --  wicz , and she is in foal right now . " A major and obviously painful choice made in deference to a career 's demands is the one not to have a child , at least for the present . She says , " It would be totally unfair to have a child or children , totally unfair to them with my life as it is right now . But I do wish 1 had one . " In partial compensation is a " sort of adopted little brother " in Italy named Silvano Rampucci , now 28 years old . " He was in a home for abandoned children I visited in Italy when I was 18 years old , " she re  --  calls . " I just fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , but I helped all I could . Then , when it was possible for me to bring him over to the United States , he was too old for the immigration quota sys  --  tem . " Eventually , however , Ram  --  pucci , today a salesman in Ostia , the ancient port of Rome , came and lived with his benefactress for several years , and they remain close . On Stefanie 's 40th birthday , Wagner and Mankiewicz gave her a surprise party , and it really was a surprise . " R.J. and Tom got to  --  gether and orchestrated the whole thing , " she says with delight . " R.J. did the best acting he 's ever done . His mother 's birthday is the following day , so it made sense when he suggested we go have a drink with her . I could n't under stand why he seemed to be stalling and stalling . When we drove up to my Beverly Hills home , I guess I should have gotten a clue from all of the cars parked around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured they were all voters , as there was a polling place at my next-door neigh  --  bor 's house . I walked in my house , and 40 dear friends shouted ' sur  --  prise ! ' " To be one of those " dear friends " of Stefanie 's obviously requires more than a little give-and-take , as it does with most celebrities . For one thing , you respect the star 's privacy and simply do n't talk about him or her . Then , too , one has to have an understanding of the reali  --  ties of working in Hollywood , where one day you can be out of work and available to be with your friends all the time  --  at least when you 're not job hunting  --  and the next day be off on a job that may take you away for months . " Most friendships here have one quality , " Stefanie explains , " almost an un  --  written law that friendships pick up exactly where they left off . It seems to be the sustaining quality of the friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 seemingly held none of the terror for Stefanie that it does for many women . As a matter of fact , she is nearly vehement on the subject . " Forty is a milestone in other people 's lives , " she exclaims , continued on page 96 96 Powers continued from page 45 " people emphasize numbers as ex  --  cuses for anything . My mother whose name is Julie and who lives with Stefanie is 70 , and she 's living proof that numbers appeal only to those people who believe in them ! Certainly , for any age , Stefanie Powers is a stunning woman : 5 foot , 61/4 inches tall , 117 pounds and that extraordinary face , with its huge hazel eyes , framed by a billowing mane of auburn hair . A Catholic by baptism , Powers does n't follow a particular religion , although she does go to mass " from time to time . " Speaking of Catholi  --  cism , she notes , " I think it is one of the great religions , like Buddhism and Taoism  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have a real value . Certain  --  ly , faith has a great value , maybe because it 's bigger than you are . " Of particular concern to her , though , is the in  --  ability of many to put their lives in perspective . " I wish we paid more at  --  tention to history , " she sighs . " I believe very much that people should have a view of changes and not live just for the moment . Everyone 's life has a part in the past , a part in the present and a part in the future . One ca n't just live solely for now . " " Hart to Hart " pro  --  pelled Stefanie Powers in just three years from be  --  ing a familiar face to be  --  ing one of the best-known and best-liked stars in the world . Still , it 's only a television show , and even the most successful have a limited lifetime  --  at best a rather ephemeral commitment for which one , seeming  --  ly , renounces love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute the fabric of most people 's lives . She is certainly aware of this and seems , at times , to hope all the fame will leave her to enjoy living a more normal life . Then , too , memories of a career that , for two decades , promised so much and returned relatively little of lasting importance must also be on her mind when she adds , " Given a proper perspective , Pm very grate  --  ful for ' Hart to Hart . ' But I ca n't believe it will be a fixture in my life  --  certainly not at its present im  --  portance . " Now , do n't think that by saying that I 'm designing my life for failure , but everything comes and goes . Life is , ultimately , the most important thing  --  living and the wonderful adventure of it all . " Ideel continued from page 64 Head Assistant . Even he ai n't never noticed it 's too dark . Me ?

He appealed to Howard passionately . " Did n't I tell you she 's a collector ? Simply , it 's proved !

The new offering was an aged wooden panel with a surface of colors once violent , but now dulled into a dingy harmony .
