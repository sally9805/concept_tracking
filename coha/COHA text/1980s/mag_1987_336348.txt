Since the Supreme Court 's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision striking down laws prohibiting abortion , almost 20 million pregnancies have been terminated in the U.S. Robert Bork believes that ruling is without foundation . His opinion chills women 's groups and cheers right-to-life supporters , who expect Bork to become part of a new court majority that will overturn Roe . That outcome , however , is far from certain . <P> Bork 's position on the law is unequivocal . " Roe v. Wade , " he asserted to Congress in 1981 , " is itself an unconstitutional decision , a serious and wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority . " He does not believe the Constitution guarantees the right to privacy , the guiding principle underlying Roe . <P> Still , Bork has never said outright that he would strike down Roe , and of late he has even paid lip service to the judicial principle that it is better to leave certain long-settled decisions in effect if reversing them would create chaos . Bork has never declared that abortion is morally wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " human life " bill that would have defined life as beginning at conception . Says John Willke , president of the National Right to Life Committee : " We 're not sure Bork is against abortion . In our circles , there is substantial doubt that he is . " <P> Nor would Justice Bork necessarily become the bellwether of an anti-Roe majority . The court still includes four staunch supporters of Roe : Harry Blackmun , the author of the decision , plus Thurgood Marshall , William Brennan and John Paul Stevens . Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Byron White both dissented from Roe and would probably vote against it again . Antonin Scalia is thought to be against abortion . Bork would make four firmly against . But Sandra Day O'Connor is a question mark , and may become the swing vote in any majority . While O'Connor believes the court has gone too far in preventing states from regulating abortion , she may be reluctant to toss out Roe completely . <P> Moreover , in the near future the court is not likely to hear any cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're going to have , " says UCLA Law Professor Julian Eule , " is cases that deal with a variety of obstacles to abortion that the states have constructed . Therefore , what the court would do , rather than say , ' We abandon Roe v. Wade , ' is to allow increasing leeway to states to regulate the parameters of the right to an abortion . " More regulation would undoubtedly mean fewer abortions . <P> One probable step would be the court 's approval of statutes that require minors to get parental permission for an abortion . On Nov. 3 the Justices will hear oral arguments in Hartigan v. Zbaraz , an appeal of a decision striking down an Illinois statute restricting minors ' access to abortion .
