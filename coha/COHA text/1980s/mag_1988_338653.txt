Flying back to Pretoria from talks in Cairo , South African Foreign Minister Roelof ( " Pik " ) Botha was in high good humor . Jauntily donning a red fez , Botha told reporters that with the aid of Chester Crocker , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs , negotiators from South Africa , Angola and Cuba had made progress on future discussions concerning the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola . But the euphoria dissolved the following day , when new fighting broke out . Pretoria said that twelve of its soldiers and 300 Angolans and Cubans were killed when a government force attacked a South African garrison . Officials in Luanda insisted that 26 South Africans and ten Angolans were killed . <P> Most observers , nevertheless , expect the talks to resume in Washington next week , when top Cuban , South African and Angolan officials will discuss the mechanics of a disengagement . As Botha pointed out with a sardonic laugh , the choice of locale places the Cubans and South Africans on the same side : both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegations to fly to Washington .
