The net loss from cuts in benefit programs , despite small tax savings , will average $240 for households with incomes under $10 , 000 in 1983 , the study said . Households with incomes of $10 , 000 to $20 , 000 stand to gain about $220 , and households with incomes of $80 , 000 or more will achieve an average net gain of $15 , 130 , the report said. // The study is the most comprehensive attempt to measure the combined effects on different income groups of President Reagan ' s budget and tax policies as passed by Congress. // // Projections Fit Reagan Plan // The distribution of the tax cut , providing the biggest savings to the highest income bracket , is precisely what the Reagan Administration envisioned . The purpose of reducing marginal tax rates was to improve incentives for work , savings and investment , in keeping with " supply side " economics. // Critics , however , deride the theory as " trickle-down economics , " saying the highest income group benefits the most , in dollar terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee that the benefits will be passed along to others in society. // The budget office , a nonpartisan agency respected for its professional expertise , analyzed changes in 18 benefit programs including Social Security , Civil Service and military pensions , unemployment insurance , food stamps , welfare , Medicaid , Medicare , guaranteed student loans , school lunches , housing assistance and veterans ' benefits. // The 50-page study was done in response to separate requests from Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee , and Representative James R. Jones , Democrat of Oklahoma , the chairman of the House Budget Committee . The study is likely to revive debate over the " fairness " of Mr. Reagan ' s program , raising new questions about whether there should be " equality of sacrifice " by the rich and poor. // Edwin L. Dale Jr. , spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget , said that he had not seen the study , but that it seemed to be " the first careful effort to do this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration ' s contention that " we have not damaged the truly needy " because the net reduction in incomes for people in the lowest income bracket would be less than one-half of 1 percent . <> <> Major Conclusions of Report // The major conclusions of the study were these : // - Reductions in Federal benefit payments will be greatest for households with incomes below $10 , 000 . In 1983 , these families will lose , on the average , $360 in Federal benefits , while those with incomes above $80 , 000 will lose an average of $120 . The loss is more significant for lower income people , who tend to rely more heavily on Federal benefits than higher income families. // - " About 40 percent of the total savings from benefit reductions come from benefits received by the lowest income category , " under $10 , 000 a year , and " more than two-thirds of the savings stem from reductions in benefits received by those with incomes less than $20 , 000. " // - The benefits lost by people whose income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all such benefit cuts . But these people would receive half of the projected $82 billion in revenue that the Federal Government expects to lose in 1983 as a result of the cut in individual income taxes. // - Gains from Federal tax reductions outweigh the loss of benefits for all but the poorest families , who have little or no tax liability , and the gains increase substantially as household income rises . In 1983 , for example , the tax cut would be worth an average of $120 to families with incomes under $10 , 000 , but it would mean a $15 , 250 savings for a family with an income above $80 , 000 . <> <> Aid Programs Hard Hit // The budget office study also said about 60 percent of all the savings in grants to state and local governments would come from programs designed to aid for low-income individuals . And it said the net effect of the changes , by 1985 , is to reduce the incomes of the poorest families by an average of three-tenths of 1 percent and to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The poorest families are those with incomes below $10 , 000 , according to the budget office . The most affluent are those with incomes of $80 , 000 or more. // The findings of the study could have significant political implications . The people who gain most from last year ' s changes constitute a relatively small segment of the population. // Twenty-three percent of all American families earn less than $10 , 000 a year ; 25 percent have annual incomes of $10 , 000 to $20 , 000 , and 35 percent have incomes of $20 , 000 to $40 , 000 . Only 16 percent of the households earn $40 , 000 to $80 , 000 , and 1 percent have incomes above $80 , 000 . <> <> Larger Effects Not Studied // The study does not measure the " macroeconomic " effects of the tax and budget cuts , that is , whether the changes , taken together , will reduce inflation and unemployment and increase the rate of economic growth , which could generate higher incomes and help offset the loss of benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any income bracket , those receiving the largest tax cuts were often not the people who suffered the largest loss of benefits . Thus , the report said , the net change of income for a particular household " may differ substantially from the average . " This is especially true in the lowest income bracket , where most people losing benefits receive no tax cut because they have no tax liability , the study said. // The budget office found that families receiving welfare benefits and food stamps " will lose about 5 to 10 percent of their total incomes on average if they have no earnings , and up to 20 percent of their incomes if they are employed. " // The individual income tax cuts will distribute a total of $82 billion in 1983 , the study said , while cuts in Federal benefit programs will save the Government $17. 5 billion . The lowest income group would get $2. 3 billion worth of tax cuts while losing $6. 9 billion in benefits. // The study also found that Federal grants " highly targeted " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , compensatory education and social services , absorbed a bigger share of the cuts than programs serving people of all income levels. //
