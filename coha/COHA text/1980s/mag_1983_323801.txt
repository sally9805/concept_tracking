" I 'm so tired . I 'm so tired of smiling . " <P> - Miss Kentucky 1936 <P> It was one of those clear days with a high sky and the tease of a cool front coming through , the kind of day that falsely moves the elderly to wrap up like Admiral Byrd . Autumn was nigh , and with its approach had come a metronomic ritual of this time of year : the crowning of a fresh Miss America . The pageant had taken place in Atlantic City , as always , and then Miss America had traveled to New York City , as always . On this splendid day , bearing baggage filled with finery , she had checked into the Plaza , the starting block on a twelve-month run . <P> Right off , Vanessa Williams , the 56th Miss America and the first black , was subjected to considerably more attention than Miss Americas in the recent past . The press , perpetually smitten by a " first " in anything , had in hand another Sally Ride , so to speak-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ideal man . " Hell , this was political ! Williams , in turn , showed the inquisitors that " First Women " these days come with a sting . " I was chosen because I was qualified for the position , " she said . " The fact that I was black was not a factor . " She took her leave then and went about her business , the business of being Miss America . <P> For this , the first week , that arrangement meant answering mostly obvious questions . David Letterman asked her how many contestants were in the pageant , and Williams replied 50 , as any of 45 million television viewers who saw the pageant could have told him . At a radio station , she was asked whether she was close to the other contestants , and she said it was difficult " to get close to 49 other women in one week . " Having said that , she got into an elevator with a local newspaper reporter who asked whether she had acquired a fur . " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . It 's a dyed mink with a fox collar . " <P> The reporter then identified herself as a member of Friends of Animals . The subject was dropped . After coronation , the snipers come out . <P> The Miss America pageant has been around so long now that the hoopla usually subsides after a day or two , and Miss America is largely forgotten-unless she shows up in your town-till she crowns her successor the following fall . This Miss America was besieged for days , however , and she thought with good reason that it was probably because she was black , as well as frank , not because , as she would have it so , that she was being recognized for her talent . After all , her talent , singing and dancing , had got her this far , and now her color seemed to be at the heart of everything .
