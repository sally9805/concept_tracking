For three days , the major concern has been his throwing arm . Rick Burleson finally made a throwing error yesterday , the first after sixgames back with the California Angels . But somebody should have also been interested in his torrid bat and his ability to hit in the clutch , which were most evident yesterday when he got the game-winning single in the Angels ' 5-3 victory over Boston . Burleson muscled an inside fastball by Bob Stanley for a basehit to right in the seventh inning as the Angels rallied for four runs to wipe out a 3-1 deficit . His second single of the game boosted his average to .538 ( 14-26 ) . Not bad for a guy who hadn ' t played in the majors for a year and a half . " I ' m pleased with my hitting thus far , " said Burleson , who , except for a brief stint with the Angles ' Triple A club in Edmonton , hadn ' t faced live pitching for 224 games . " But I ' m not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a good start in spring training or at the beginning of a season . It doesn ' t mean all that much . " Sure I ' m a .500 hitter right now . But that doesn ' t mean I ' m going to be at .500 at the end . With luck , I ' ll be back to where I ' m usually at when the season is over . If if can do that , I ' ll be happy . " Burleson was happy with the success he had against the Red Sox , and particularly against Stanley . But he said what happened had more to do with his hitting philosophy than with the fact that he was facing his old teammates . " Stanley jammed me , " said Burleson . " But I believe when that happens , you try to inside-out it , or muscle the ball the other way . Stanley is like a lot of sinkerballers . If you try to pull one of his inside pitches , you ' ll wind up hitting it on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t make any rash judgments about Ed Jurak , whose talents he likes very much . " He ' s much better than I thought , " said Burleson . " He works hard , and you can definitely tell he wants to play . When you ' re not playing every day , the only thing you can do is work hard and wait for the opportunity , and you can see he ' s doing that . " . . . Tommy John on winning after three straight defeats : " At the age of 40 , if you have two or three bad starts , people say you ' re over the hill . If you are Joaquin Andujar and 28 , people say you have had a tough time of it . A few years ago , I remember people saying Yaz was all through . To me , he ' s hitting as good as ever . " . . . First base continued to be a trouble spot for umpires yesterday as Steve Palermo got into a couple of beefs on calls . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the 1140th of his career , pushing him ahead of Ty Cobb for sixth on the career list . . . With yesterday ' s crowd of 32,142 , the Red Sox have drawn 889,564 this year and should go over 1 million this week . . . Jim Rice now has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games . He has seven home runs and 13 RBIs in his last seven games . Reggie Jackson has nothing but admiration for the way Yastrzemski is conducting his final season . Jackson says Yaz is playing " like a Hall of Famer . " Jackson , who has two years to go on his contract with the Angels , already knows how he ' d like to finish up . " I ' ll hit a home run my last time up , " he said , " and that ' ll be it . I ' ll just walk away from the game and let that be the last memory of me . " . . . Bobby Grich , who has missed the past 11 games because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was examined by Leonard Wallenstein , the Orioles ' physcian . . . The Seattle Mariners come to town tonight under new skipper Del Crandall , who has juggled his staff for the three-game series . Mike Moore ( 0-3 ) will pitch the opener against Bobby Ojeda ( 5-3 ) . The other matchups : Bryan Clark ( 3- 2 ) vs . Mike Brown ( 5-4 ) , and Jim Beattie ( 7-5 ) vs . Dennis Eckersley ( 5-6 ) .
