PALMERSTOWN , U.S.A. March 20 , CBS , 8p.m . E.S.T. <P> <P> No one has more cleverly or profitably turned social issues into prime-time TV entertainment than Norman Lear and Alex Haley . Without Lear 's All in the Family and Haley 's Roots , network television in the 1970s might nearly have been bankrupt of innovation . To kick off the new decade , Lear and Haley have joined forces to undertake what could be their most exciting project yet : Palmerstown , U.S.A. is a new series that aspires to combine the historical sweep of Roots II with the activist humor of Lear 's best sitcoms . Still , a lot of hard work lies ahead . Though the first episode of Palmerstown abundantly illustrates Lear 's and Haley 's political concerns , it offers little evidence of their considerable dramatic gifts . The show is completely humorless and simplistic in its moralizing ; it embraces exactly the kind of preachiness that Haley and Lear have scrupulously avoided in the past . <P> The setting is a fictional town in Tennessee around 1935 . Palmerstown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot like the homestead of The Waltons . The premise is reminiscent of Mark Twain : two young boys , one black ( Jermain Hodge Johnson ) and one white ( Brian Godfrey Wilson ) , are best friends despite the racial barriers that separate their respective families . The two-hour opening show introduces the boys and their parents with the dubious aid of a very frail plot mechanism . The white father , a grocer ( Beeson Carroll ) , mistakenly overcharges his black counter part , a blacksmith ( Bill Duke ) , by $3.47 on a monthly bill . What follows is an escalating series of conflicts that not only sets blacks against whites , but husbands against wives and parents against children . Eventually the K.K.K. makes grotesque threats , boycotts start to destroy the town 's economy , and it seems that a new Civil War might break out . Since the story 's underpinnings are so weak , the strain on credulity borders on the ridiculous . It is as if an I Love Lucy episode about a lost purse suddenly turned into an overheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period detail and acting , Palmerstown is well produced , but it is full of stereotypes and padding . The many repetitive confrontations unfold in the prosaic manner of a high school civics class . The black characters are all saints , as they are not in other Lear and Haley shows , and the whites are generally either fire-breathing racists or pure-hearted liberals . There are also too many sentimental scenes that show the two young heroes frolicking in brotherly love on sunny fields . The results are so tame that not even a last-minute medical crisis can arouse any excitement . <P> If Lear and Haley would only remember their roots , they should soon bring on a new Edith Bunker or Chicken George to stir Palmerstown up . <P> - Frank Rich
