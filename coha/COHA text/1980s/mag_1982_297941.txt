OPPENHEIMER PBS , beginning May 11,9p.m . E.D.T. <P> <P> They thought they could do it . All their calculations told them they could do it . But it was not until 5:30 a.m. , Monday , July 16 , 1945 , that they were sure . Then , in a flash that illuminated the New Mexico desert for miles around , the atomic era began , and J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of Los Alamos scientists realized that they had pulled off the most astonishing scientific achievement of the century . Only later did they truly comprehend the extent to which they had released an evil genie from its bottle that neither they , nor anyone else , could ever put back . <P> This saga of science is a compelling story , and the brilliant , arrogant Oppenheimer is a compelling character-a tragic symbol of one of the most triumphant yet melancholy periods in U.S. history . He would have made an ideal subject for an American TV network , but it is just as well that none of them has told his story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-part series from the BBC . <P> The first episode begins in 1938 , when " Oppie , " as his friends called him , was teaching theoretical physics at the University of California at Berkeley . Only 34 , he had brought together perhaps the most brilliant team of young physicists in the world-the Oppenheimers , as they were known on campus . They worshiped their mentor , imitated him and worked endless hours with him exploring the new frontier of atomic physics . One of the significant accomplishments of the series is that it conveys to nonscientists the elusive quality of scientific passion . And one of the accomplishments of Sam Waterston , who plays the lead , is that he captures not only Oppenheimer 's arrogance but his mesmerizing appeal . <P> In 1939 , after they read that two German scientists had split the atom , the Oppenheimers knew the possible end of that equation : a bomb of almost incomprehensible destructiveness . A problem remained , however : how to build it . After the U.S. entered the war , Oppie was assigned the chief responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory , he led-and occasionally pushed and shoved-an extraordinary gathering of the country 's top minds in constructing the instrument that exploded atop a tower in the desert . When the test bomb detonated , he silently repeated to himself a line from the Bhagavad-Gita Hindu devotional poem : " I am become Death , the shatterer of worlds . " <P> As the father of the atom bomb , Oppenheimer enjoyed a postwar eminence equaled perhaps by only one other scientist , Einstein himself . But his fall was even swifter than his rise . He was a political innocent who had never read a newspaper or current-affairs magazine until he was in his mid-30s and did not hear , incredibly enough , about the Great Crash of 1929 until long after it had happened . At Berkeley he associated mostly with leftists-his lover and his brother were both Communists-and although he was never a Communist himself , he lent his name to left-wing organizations .
