Whatever form this awakening takes , however , there are three things about it that are certain : it is permanent , it penetrates , and it grows . Once art ' ' strikes , ' ' there isn ' t very much we can do about it short of moving to a desert island or isolating ourselves in a mountain wilderness. // If we aren ' t careful , art can invade and dominate our lives forever - as it has mine . I can not imagine what my life would be like without art , especially since I was only a young boy when I fell under its spell . It took only a few hours poring over a book of Rembrandt etchings to change me forever . And when I consider how many other , hardly less dramatic ' ' aftershocks ' ' art has administered to me over the years , I ' m left with absolutely no comprehension of who and what I ' d be today without it. // Art can reach out and touch us on many levels . I responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a boy , I needed proof that certain deeply felt but still unformed realities and dimensions within me weren ' t unique and peculiar to me - and so suspect , and possibly even ' ' bad . ' ' Rembrandt gave me the assurance that what I felt deep inside me was universal , and a dynamic part of human life . And because he did , he became my friend for life. // Not all experiences with art , however , need be that deeply and personally significant . Art can be deliciously lighthearted and full of fun as well , or deal exclusively with perfection of line , color , or form . It can be grandly monumental ( Michelangelo ) or wonderfully frisky ( Calder ) - or any nuance or dimension of human reality in between . But whatever form it takes , it demands one thing from us if we are to benefit from its special qualities . And that is a willingness to respond to it with an open mind and spirit. // To some , art is limited to the familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feelings of comfort , coziness , or security . For them art consists of recognition , of being reminded of pleasant childhood dreams , of beautiful landscapes , loved ones , or religious personages or ideals - and in forms that pictorially reflect these experiences romantically or sentimentally. // The issue of artistic quality is frequently quite foreign to these individuals . And if it is , then very little distinction is made in their homes between junk and art , between a horrible , sugary painting of a ' ' beautiful ' ' sunset and an excellent museum reproduction of Durer ' s Young Hare. // The crucial factor in waking up to art is first to awaken more fully to life , to gain a deeper insight into , and a greater sensitivity for , the value , nature , quality , and purpose of all living things . With that as a start , and with an open and loving eye for every type and form of art , it is altogether possible that what seemed nondescript and dull before will gradually ( or even suddenly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beauty . And art itself will become a dynamic challenge instead of merely a passive form of sentimental remembrance , or of something ' ' pretty ' ' to hang on the wall. // One particular work of art that I suspect did as much as any in recent years to alert otherwise indifferent viewers to the potentials of art is Richard Lippold ' s wire-sculpture Variations Within a Sphere , No. 10 ; The Sun . Or at least that was true during the years it was on display at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. // It is an extremely delicate and fragile work constructed of fine gold wire that crosses and crisscrosses a space eleven feet high , twenty-two feet wide , and several feet deep to form a shimmering and glittering circular image representing the sun . This was exhibited in semi-darkness against a black backdrop , and was continually bathed in light. // It was pure enchantment . Almost everyone fell under its spell , not only because it seemed so magical and so genuinely of and about light and the sun , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right moment ( 1956 ) to intrigue a public becoming somewhat jaded by Abstract Expressionism ' s painterly explosions . I never once passed it without encountering at least a dozen individuals studying it or commenting upon it . Before long it even became a popular place to meet old friends or make new ones - or to hear some of the most outrageous explanations of ' ' modern art ' ' ( usually made by a father to his children ) to be heard anywhere. // But even if they were outrageous , they were serious and honest attempts to understand something new and strange . There was a curiosity about why something so abstract could be so totally enchanting and beautiful . Some of that must be attributed to its glitteringly exquisite strands of gold wire sparkling in the light and appearing to all the world like a huge piece of intricate gold jewelry. // But there was more to it than that . And what that was really had to do with the ideals and the qualities of art , and with the ability certain works have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people with no real previous experience with modernist art ' ' trusted ' ' this piece because it was so exquisitely and lovingly crafted . It looked , in other words , like a serious attempt on someone ' s part to shape and express an idea - and not like something casually tossed off by a child and then exhibited in order to pull the wool over the public ' s eyes . Anyone taking it seriously would not , as a result , be in danger of being proved a fool for having liked it. // For another thing , it projected a powerfully radiant and lyrical quality that seemed almost mystical in effect ; it moved viewers to respond warmly and sympathetically toward it . This quality , this luminosity , had the added effect of stirring deep emotions , and of remaining deeply and lovingly embedded in the viewer ' s memory long after his last actual encounter with it. // And finally , it was so clearly and logically constructed that its ' ' magical ' ' effects could be analyzed and understood by anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few viewers , as a matter of fact , seemed satisfied with its legitimacy only after they had checked out its key wires , saw where and how they were anchored , and grasped the logic behind their crucial intersections . Only then were they able to relax , fold their arms , and beam confidently and approvingly at the shimmering structure before them. // All that , I realize , may not sound like the most profound recommendations for a work of art . And I must admit that the first and third are somewhat suspect . And yet they served their purpose if they permitted a few viewers to relax and to become open enough to allow the work ' s aesthetic resonances to penetrate their consciousness , or even to activate their sensibilities . The road to the appreciation of art isn ' t always grand and spectacular . It is often very simple and everyday , and made up of otherwise quite insignificant things such as common sense , craftsmanship , logic , and physical attractiveness. // //          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
