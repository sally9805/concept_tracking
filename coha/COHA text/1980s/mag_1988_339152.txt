As children , many Americans greeted a bowl of oatmeal with an expression of disgust . " It 's good for you , " Mom would intone , but who believed her ? The yucky greige sludge might be filling , but good for you ? Forget it . They sure believe her now . Today cholesterol-conscious consumers are eagerly lapping up not only oatmeal but oat bran and oat muffins and oat cookies  --  in fact , just about anything with oats in it . The once reviled grain has suddenly emerged as the hottest health food around . People are sprinkling it on cereal , mixing it with fruit , baking it in cakes , dissolving it in shakes and swallowing it in pills . Declares Charles Rosenblum , owner of a natural-foods store in Manhattan : " People are interested in taking it in any form they can . " <P> Why all the fuss ? The word is out that eating oats can lower cholesterol levels in the blood . Result : groceries and supermarkets ca n't keep oat products on the shelves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oat- bran purchases have more than quintupled . The Quaker Oats plant in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , is working three shifts every day and still not meeting demand . At the Real Food Co. in San Francisco , a health-food emporium , sales of bulk oat bran have tripled in the past year to 1,000 lbs . a month . Sales of oat- based breakfast cereals and cookies have exploded 500% at Alfalfa 's Market in Boulder . <P> Companies are rushing to create new oat foods . Kellogg 's has just introduced a cold cereal , Common Sense Oat Bran ; General Mills came out last year with Total Oatmeal . Health Valley Foods , a California natural-foods firm , has brought out 18 oat products since 1986 . Among the eight launched this year : oat-bran animal cookies for children . <P> The current craze stems from studies showing that oats , particularly oat bran , can have a salutary effect on blood levels of total cholesterol and , even better , of the " bad " type of cholesterol known as LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oat bran daily for six to eight weeks can lower total cholesterol some 20% and LDLs as much as 25% . " It 's great stuff , " says Dr. James Anderson of the University of Kentucky , who pioneered the study of oat bran in the 1970s . Anderson estimates that up to 85% of Americans with high cholesterol could benefit from an oat-rich diet , with virtually no worries about harmful side effects . <P> How oat bran works is still a mystery . One theory is that soluble fiber , which is plentiful in oats as well as citrus fruits and peas and beans , binds up cholesterol-rich bile acids that aid in digestion , thus helping to remove LDLs from the bloodstream . Health experts , however , are cautioning that many new oat products are high in saturated fats and calories . Kellogg 's Cracklin ' Oats cereal , for example , is made with coconut oil , a dietary no-no . And many muffins are loaded with eggs and sugar . Moreover , oat enthusiasts are mistaken if they think scarfing down oats allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Kenneth Cooper , author of Controlling Cholesterol and head of the Aerobic Center in Dallas : " It reminds me of the people who use artificial sweeteners and then drink a soda loaded with sugar .
