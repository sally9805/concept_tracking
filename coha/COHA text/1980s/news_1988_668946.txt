The rapid destruction that savaged homes and hopes , separated families and heaped contamination on entire neighborhoods has long since receded . Houses that were filled with water and muck now are clean and comfortable ; lawns and bushes are beginning to grow . But many of the stains of last year ' s flood-those that can ' t be scrubbed , bleached or thrown away- remain . For the Luby family of Elmhurst , like 2 , 471 other families in Cook and Du Page Counties who received federal loans , the waters left debts they will be paying off for years . For the Lal family of Des Plaines , the invading waters of August came just a month after they had finished restoring their home from a severe flood in October , 1986 . They have since repaired the new damage and are planning to move next year . For 6-year-old Jason Piechowiak , of Elmhurst , like many other children who saw their homes disrupted for months , there was a new image to crowd his nightmares . And , along with the unease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their refurbished homes with little confidence . Nothing is in place , they say , to stop the whole thing from happening again . " I am afraid . We ' ve worked so hard , spent so much money , " said Debbie Luby , whose home sustained $75 , 000 in damage . " Emotionally , physically , we ' ve put everything into this . We ' re drained of everything . " The waters that spilled into the Des Plaines River , Salt Creek and other tributaries from the 9. 35 inches of rain that fell Aug. 13 and 14 caused more financial damage than any other disaster in the state . More than 11 , 500 homes were damaged or destroyed , from Des Plaines in the north to Lyons in the south . For those who had just suffered a flood of similar proportions the October before , its effects were particularly cruel . Dr. Roshan Lal estimates that his Des Plaines home sustained $30 , 000 in damage from the first flood and half that in the second-but only because he didn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping my fingers crossed , but I ' m thinking I should move , " he said . " But then I think it ' s a rare thing . It ' s happened ; it won ' t happen again . " He said he fears declining property values-a concern shared by many , regardless of the suburb . In Elmhurst , Debbie Boomsma said an appraiser lowered the value of her and her husband ' s house by 8 to 10 percent . " The thought that it could happen again-I would just get up and leave , " Boomsma said . " I wanted to sell so bad . But Bob said , ' Deb , we just can ' t afford it . ' " So they made the repairs to the basement but only recently have begun storing belongings there . Some flood victims , like the Lubys , made a commitment to stay in their homes and took the opportunity to add things they had planned for years : central air-conditioning , new plumbing , thicker insulation . " I like the location , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods . " I was born and raised in this town . I raised my children here . This has not been an every-year thing by any means . " People have , however , sought help . To assist with the expense of repairs that , in some cases , almost equaled the houses ' value , officials of the Small Business Administration stayed in Chicago more than two months . They doled out $41 million in low-interest loans to homes and businesses in Du Page and Cook Counties , according to Patricia Forsyth , a spokeswoman for the agency . Of the homes and businesses destroyed or damaged in the flood , 2 , 623 owners received the low- and moderate-interest loans . Some owners refused to apply ; the applications of others were denied , mostly because they didn ' t include required documents . Tony Parish of Brookfield received a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state that helped him begin the arduous task of repairing his home , its rotting porch and the destroyed lawn that , somehow , ended up clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in federal and state grants went to repair homes , businesses and public facilities such as roads and bridges , said William N. Powers , a hazard-mitigation officer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . " Some people here had damage and didn ' t ask for any help , " Parish said . " To some people , it ' s a matter of pride . For us , it ' s not a matter of pride . We had so much damage , it ' s just taking assistance that ' s given-just do it . " That kind of attitude-an almost relentless drive to restore the homes- took mental health experts , prepared for a rush of victims with " post- traumatic stress syndrome , " by surprise . In Du Page County , two people showed up at the first special counseling sessions , one at the second . The sessions ended after that , said Nona Rathsack , an official in the Du Page County Health Department . " Part of the way to deal with a disaster is you just work and work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives in Elmhurst with her husband , Mike , and their two sons , Jason and Robert , 3 . " Also , it ' s the necessity to get back into your home . " But that ' s not to say they don ' t nervously watch the clouds and the creek every time a storm blows up . Last Monday ' s heavy rains provided a sleepless night for people from Des Plaines to Brookfield . Even heavy rains at vacation spots stir fears . When Bob and Debbie Boomsma were greeted with days of downpours on a Wisconsin trip in mid-July , they were afraid to come home , she said , because of what they might find . " When you leave now , it ' s not just ' Will you check the mail ? ' but ' Will you check the basement ? ' " Debbie Boomsma said . " God forbid if it ever happens again , " Debbie Luby said . " My husband said we ' d just declare bankruptcy and not even do it . " Luby and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their home to its frame , which , like the floors , driveway and deck , was scrubbed with bleach . Everything was replaced-the saturated walls , warped cabinets , carpeting , buckled floors , appliances and the exterior siding . They weren ' t able to move into their home until just before Christmas . " Everything the flood touches you have to redo , " said Parish , whose home sustained $40 , 000 in damage . " And it touches everything . You have no idea of the pollution that comes in the flood . It ' s everybody else ' s waste , and it stays forever . " While the Lubys labored on the house , they lived with their three children in a 28-foot camper parked in their driveway . It cost them , as Debbie Luby says , a fortune to rent , but " our main objective was to keep the family together . " Today , with its American country decor , the house is comfortable and inviting , an obvious point of pride to Luby . Stenciled wallpaper hangs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , plush carpeting covers the floors . All the furniture is new . But the Lubys will be paying off federal loans for the repairs and replacements for more than a decade . " Our house even smelled like a new house . When they brought the lumber-I just loved the smell of the lumber , after smelling that other so long , " she said . " Everybody says , ' Aren ' t you happy with how it turned out ? ' But I ' d rather have the old house , our old mortgage back and one or two less loans under our belt . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by John Irvine .
