NEW YORK  --  Bond prices declined yesterday amid concern that the dollar ' s sharp decline in foreign exchange trading may keep the Federal Reserve System from easing credit conditions further . Until recently , many analysts were predicting that the Fed soon would push interest rates lower in an attempt to stimulate economic activity . Now some contend the Fed will wait , hoping the dollar ' s drop will revive the nation ' s beleaguered manufacturing industries by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive . The Fed ' s policy-making arm , known as the Federal Open Market Committee , yesterday concluded a two-day meeting to establish credit strategy for the weeks ahead . Also on the committee ' s agenda was a review of the Fed ' s money supply targets for this year and the setting of new ones for 1986 . Fed officials declined to comment on what actions the committee took . But some details of the meeting are to be disclosed next Wednesday , when Paul Volcker , Reserve Board chairman , is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday by about 1/2 point , or approximately $5 for each $1 , 000 face amount . Most short-term interest rates edged higher . William V. Sullivan Jr. , a senior vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , believes the Fed ' s committee decided to leave credit conditions unchanged . But he argued that the group probably authorized a further credit-easing move at a later date should the growth of the nation ' s money supply slow from its recent torrid pace . Some analysts have urged the Fed either to ignore the rapid money growth or to increase its growth target for the basic money supply , known as M1 . But others say such a move would be a mistake . The Fed ' s credibility would be " ill-served " by such an action , said Raul A. Nicho , executive vice president and economist at Money Market Services Inc . , Belmont , Calif . Nonetheless , many investment managers say the Fed must act soon to push interest rates down to prevent a recession . " It would be irresponsible for the Fed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakness in the economy " and the continued problems of many poor nations in meeting their debt payments , said Alan Reynolds , vice president at Polyconomics Inc . He urged the Fed to slash its discount rate to 6 1/2% from 7 1/2% . The discount rate is the fee charged by the Fed on loans to banks and savings institutions . Several congressmen have also urged the Fed to cut the discount rate . Rep. Jack Kemp ( R. , N.Y. ) yesterday sent the Fed a telegram exhorting it to reduce the discount rate immediately by " at least one full percentage point . " He said that " despite optimistic talk from some experts , indicators of economic weakness are appearing across the board . " The behavior of the money supply , however , could keep the Fed from lowering the discount rate soon , some analysts say . The M1 measure has been soaring in recent weeks , and analysts generally expect that figures to be released by the Fed this afternoon will show another large rise . They also contend that monthly figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grew strongly in June . The median estimate of 44 analysts by Money Market Services calls for a $1. 5 billion increase in M1 for the week ended July 1 . That would leave the measure $15. 3 billion above the upper end of the Fed ' s target range , which seeks 4% to 7% growth this year . The M1 yardstick consists of checking deposits and cash held by the public . Here are the weekly lower and upper limits implied by the Fed ' s target for M1 , as well as figures already reported , in billions of dollars : Table Week Ended Lower Actual Upper May 27 . . . . $566. 4 $585. 0 $574. 0 June 3 . . . . 565. 8 585. 9 575. 1 June 10 . . . 586. 3 590. 8 575. 9 June 17 . . . 566. 7 589. 3 576. 6 June 24 . . . 567. 1 591. 9 577. 3 July 1 . . . . 567. 6 . . . . . 578. 1 July 8 . . . . 568. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . 568. 4 . . . . . 579. 6 <> According to Money Market Services , the median estimate of 35 analysts polled is for the figures to show M2 jumped $26 billion in June . That would put the measure $1. 5 billion above the Fed ' s target range , which calls for 6% to 9% growth this year . The median estimate of 34 analysts calls for a June rise of $30. 5 billion in M3 , a still broader measure . If so , M3 would remain within its target growth range of 6% to 9 1/2% .
