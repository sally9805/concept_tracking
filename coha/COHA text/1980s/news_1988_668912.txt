It is rare that a book shakes Washington , let alone the White House , but Donald Regan ' s memoir of his service as President Reagan ' s chief of staff and Treasury secretary has done just that . Republicans are mortified . The closer they are to the President , the greater their anger and anguish . It took me more interviews than it should have to understand that for them this is harder to swallow than the Iran-contra affair . That was a presidential blunder , a mistake in judgment that , in part , could be imputed to others . Some of the damage could be repaired by firing those responsible for leading the President astray . The rest could be mitigated by reminding people of Reagan successes in other areas of foreign policy . This is a total embarrassment , at the tail end of the President ' s term , something that can not be erased and is not likely to be forgotten . The picture Regan draws of a domineering First Lady , with her astrological adviser , and a passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t even react to a smoking fireplace in his office , is so weird that it carries its own built-in credibility . As a result , as many grieving Reaganites see it , their leader has been reduced to a joke . The man they have loved and respected and followed has always had his critics and his enemies . But never has he been dismissed or patronized . That it is happening just now makes it all the worse . There is an inevitable sense of letdown for the people in the White House as an administration reaches its final months . It is infinitely harder when things turn sour for the President . The hours are just as long , the duties just as daunting as when he is going from triumph to triumph . But instead of the lift of success , it ' s the psychological burden of failure his associates carry home at night . It is easy for us , as reporters , to write off " flawed " or " failed " presidencies . But for those who labor in those administrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Reaganites have been having a hard time of it , even before Regan published his act of literary vengeance on his former patron . In recent months , they have seen too many of their former colleagues in courts , in hospitals and in unflattering headlines . What makes it worse is that the wounds Reagan has suffered have been inflicted by his friends , not his enemies . No Democrat and no " liberal reporter " has drawn as unflattering a picture of this President as have his chosen associates in government-David Stockman , Alexander Haig , Michael Deaver , Larry Speakes and now Regan . The portrait they paint is appalling . It shows a President almost devoid of curiosity , reflectiveness , energy or purpose , a man full of his own preconceptions , yet easily manipulated . The most stunning reaction I heard to the Regan book came from a man who has been an intimate of Reagan ' s since Reagan became governor of California , a man who was a leader in every one of Reagan ' s campaigns for the presidency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to carry out some of the most delicate assignments . Like every other Reaganite , he was angry with Donald Regan , but he said , " I blame The Man , " meaning the President , for the unprecedented flood of unflattering memoirs . " Why ? " I asked . " You remember what David Stockman did to him in 1981 , " this Republican said . He was referring to the former budget director ' s confessions , in William Greider ' s Atlantic magazine interviews , of the fiscal chicanery in the budget and tax package he had helped Reagan push through Congress . The Stockman interviews were the first insider ' s account that showed the emperor had no clothes . " When Stockman did that , " the President ' s friend said , " he should have made an example of him . Thrown him out of the White House , and let people know that if they worked for him , he expected their loyalty . " " Instead , " he said , " he called Stockman in and chewed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patsy , and so they treat him like a patsy . " I was stunned , and it took me a couple minutes to understand why . I had never , in 22 years of covering Reagan , heard anyone apply that word " patsy " to him . And I certainly never expected to hear it from this presidential friend . That told me how complete-and humiliating-a disaster this public undressing has been.
