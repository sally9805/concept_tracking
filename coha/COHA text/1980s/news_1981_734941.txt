txt EVERYBODY KNOWS , or ought to , that when April 15 arrives next year we will all be paying lower income tax rates if President Reagan 's economic program is approved by Congress . ' Those who have been paying attention also know that Reagan 's plan benefits the rich more than the rest of us . After inflation and Social Security tax increases are factored in , a couple makdng $20,000 per year will get a $1,000 tax break when ( and if ) the Reagan plan is fully implemented in three years . A faintly making $200,000 would save $30,000 . Anyone who feels offended by this imbalance can complain and vote Democratic next time , but there 's nothing underhanded about it . Republicans believe that America prospers when rich people have More money to save , spend , and invest . The people elected a Republican administration and it is promoting its economic philosophy openly and publicly . But this is n't the only way the Reagan administration plans to help the rich . Ever so quietly , the administration has proposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenue Service . ? Norton Kondracke Is executive editor of The Neer Republic magazine . IT 'S ONE OF the great tragedies of American life that some of the smartest people in the country choose to get rich by becoming tax lawyers instead of doing work that would help the nation 's productivity . What tax lawyers invent , instead of exportable high technology , is tax shelters . Some of them are classics , . such as the legendary wholesale Bible scheme . Under this dodge , a person in the 70 per cent tax bracket ( i.e. , somebody rich ) could buy 1,000 Bibles at wholesale for $10 each , then donate the Bibles to a church or school and take a tax deduction for ' the retail value of the Bibles ( $20 ) . For an outlay of $10,000 , he 'd claim a $20,000 gift , save $14,000 in taxes and end up making $9,000 . The IRS caught up with that one , but tax lawyers never sleep . They are constantly combing the statute books for places their clients can hide money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rich people with smart lawyers do n't just buy boats the way you or I might , taking a deduction just for the sales tax and the interest on the payments . They buy boats on a purchase-lease back arrangement from a boat dealer who also runs a charter business . The seller leases from the purchaser , who then treats his boat not as a weekend retreat , but ( for tax purposes ) as a business . Ile gets an investment tax credit for his purchase . lie gets a fast deprecia tion allowance . And even the cost of his mooring and maintenance come off as business . deductions . Nice , eh ? TAX LAWYERS also invented , for the investment house of Merrill Lynch ( formerly headed by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan ) the following strategem : If 90 investors are jointly enrolled in a dubious shelter scheme , the broker would pay the legal costa of any one partner who ran afoul of the IRS . Just before the tax court was about to rule , the investor would settle with the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a legal precedent that could be used against the other investors . This device is being challenged in court right now . . The point is , it takes IRS manpower to catch tax chislers , but President Reagan is cutting back . Already , the IRS is so short-staffed that it is auditing only 2 per cent of the nation 's tax returns , an all time low . Those audits netted the government $9 billion last year , and one former top IRS official said that amount easily could be doubled if enough enforcement personnel were hired . If the Republicans wanted to balance the budget or help the " truly needy , " they would invest the necessary money to catch the nation 's taX cheats . But , I 'd bet that most of them , and their lawyers , voted Republican .
