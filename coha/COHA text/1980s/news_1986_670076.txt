NEW YORK  --  The Rev. Leon Sullivan towers over the lectern at a closed session with a few hundred corporate executives gathered in a plush hotel ballroom . " Let us pray , " he intones . After a gentle opening prayer , Mr. Sullivan , a black Baptist minister from Philadelphia , launches into his hard sell . The executives , most of them white , are from some 200 U.S. companies that subscribe to his so-called Sullivan Principles , which he drafted nearly a decade ago to promote fair treatment of South Africa ' s black workers . But following the code is no longer enough . Urging the executives to violate apartheid laws , Mr. Sullivan tells them to " foster corporate civil disobedience to the fullest extent possible . " Publicly rebuke the South African government , he continues . Bring blacks into the top ranks of management and the anti-apartheid campaign . " And take the heat , " Mr. Sullivan says , his voice building . " And take the heat . And take the heat ! AND TAKE THE HEAT ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sermon ends to unenthusiastic applause , Mr. Sullivan says chidingly , " That ' s a hand that says , ' We don ' t believe it , but we ' ll listen anyway . ' " The executives ' tepid response partly reflects their frustration . They simply don ' t know what to do . U.S. companies are paralyzed by the South Africa issue . Publicly , they continue to call apartheid morally repugnant , and they argue that staying put is the only way they can work for change . But privately , a growing number of U.S. companies are losing hope and preparing to pull out . " I don ' t know of a single company down there that isn ' t looking at contingency plans to leave , " says a senior executive with a big U.S. manufacturer that operates in South Africa . Some 260 U.S. companies do business in South Africa  --  50 of the 100 largest industrial corporations , including General Motors Corp . , Mobil Corp . , International Business Machines Corp. and Coca-Cola Co . In most cases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earnings and assets . But it occupies a relatively large chunk of executives ' time because of what some call " the hassle factor " of doing business there . It is a no-win situation . The deteriorating economy has devastated most companies ' profits in South Africa . The black population grows ever more hostile to U.S. companies ' presence . The Sullivan Principles , which have provided a moral framework for doing business in a repressive state , are under attack as ineffective . While South Africa burns , companies are viewed as doing too little too late . Staying in South Africa will require them to spend many more millions than they ever expected and plunge them more deeply into South Africa ' s messy internal affairs . " Congress would attack U.S. business for interfering in a sovereign state if we did this anywhere else  --  but South Africa is different , " Sal G. Marzullo , chairman of a U.S. business group , tells executives in the closed-door Sullivan meeting , unaware that a reporter was present . " It isn ' t money anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that . It ' s now a moral obligation to see this out . " But if they leave for business reasons , companies may look hypocritical after a decade of arguing that their presence betters the lives of South Africa ' s 23 million blacks . A mass corporate exit could set an unwanted precedent for other countries with repressive regimes . It would also mean abandoning employees , customers and millions in assets . Companies from other countries are already winning business in South Africa by emphasizing the chances of a U.S. exodus . Even Mr. Sullivan , until now a moderate ally of the companies in their efforts to remain in South Africa , has turned on them . Many executives are uncomfortable with his call for violating apartheid laws . Even worse is his tough deadline : Apartheid must end and blacks must have the vote by next May 31  --  an extremely unlikely eventuality  --  or he will call on all U.S. firms there to close down and leave . Immediately . Events since Mr. Sullivan ' s recent meeting in New York have increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African government grows more repressive . The Reagan administration reconsiders its policy , and the U.S. House of Representatives calls for a total business withdrawal . Meantime , South Africa ' s violence spreads , and has begun spilling over into white business areas . Companies , not surprisingly , are preparing for the worst . The senior executive who says many companies are devising contingency plans for leaving also describes an increasing sense of hopelessness that anything can really be done . " That is terribly frustrating , " he says , " for people who like to think they can solve any kind of problem if they just tend to it . " Many executives would be relieved if the Reagan Administration simply ordered a total withdrawal , he adds . The dilemma is so distressing that few executives are willing to talk about the whole mess publicly . Members of the U.S. State Department ' s advisory panel on South Africa declined to be interviewed on the record for this story . People who would talk generally did so only if their names wouldn ' t be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talking , says a Bell &; Howell Co. spokesman . In April the company sold its South African unit to a European company for $1 and took a $14 million charge . It had long defended its unit as beneficial to 150 workers there but withdrew because U.S. schools were banning orders of its textbooks and equipment because of the South African tie . Chairman Donald Frye is " personally embarrassed , " the spokesman says , " at having to just kind of cut and run . " U.S. companies ' pessimism increased as their bankers soured on South Africa ' s future when the government declared a state of emergency in July 1985 . Chase Manhattan Corp. was the first major bank to freeze credit lines , totaling perhaps $500 million . Other major banks then implemented credit crackdowns of their own . Now , 37 major banks prohibit all lending to the South African private sector , the Investor Responsibility Research Center says . Barring a bloodbath in South Africa , U.S. firms probably won ' t suddenly shut down en masse and all leave at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure " a long , continuing , slow decline . " Already , though , more companies are tiring of the political heat and financial losses . Fifteen have left this year , including General Electric Co. and GTE Corp. ; 38 mostly small firms withdrew last year , up sharply from seven in 1984 , according to the research center . IBM and Xerox Corp. both have expressed increasing pessimism recently , and they may become the next major companies to shut down if conditions continue to worsen . Even when companies sell their South African interests , many of them continue some kind of business links . GTE Corp. in April sold a drill-bit maker to the unit ' s management . But the 40-employee unit will sell other GTE cutting-tool products as well , and a local distributor separately is to sell GTE phone systems . Bell &; Howell shed its South African unit , but it is negotiating to have the purchaser sell up to $1 million a year in Bell &; Howell microfilm equipment to international customers operating there . U.S. business ties to South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with South African companies , if not investing there directly . The research center says U.S. firms account for 20% of all foreign investment in South Africa and hold half of the local computer market , half of the petroleum industry and one-third of the automobile market . South African business , however , accounts for only 1% of the U.S. companies ' total foreign investment . For years business had two major justifications for staying in South Africa  --  pure financial returns , and the goal of helping the oppressed . Neither works anymore . It is widely recognized that the U.S. presence has failed to improve conditions beyond the workplace and beyond the 96 , 000 people ( 1% of the work force ) that U.S. companies employ . South Africa ' s economy provides little hope for the U.S. companies , as it has lost 250 , 000 jobs in three years , and the local currency has lost 35% of its value since February alone , in relation to the dollar . U.S. companies can " hold on maybe a year or so , not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Roly Clark , president of the Signatory Association , the new group of U.S. companies subscribing to Mr. Sullivan ' s code . Commonwealth nations , for their part , are to decide next month whether to impose economic sanctions as urged by a panel known as the Eminent Persons Group . An advisory committee to the Secretary of State is expected to recommend a policy course by the fall , and some members may be girding for a harder line . Companies , meanwhile , are losing sales in the U.S. as more cities and counties ( 20 so far ) impose product boycotts and service-contract bans similar to those that prompted Bell &; Howell ' s exit from South Africa . The U.S. bans , one official says , have a greater impact than past threats to sell the stock of companies that do business in South Africa . Contract bans , he says , have begun to tip the scale toward finding a way of disengaging . " How do you do that and lose the least amount of capital ? " he asks . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies can ' t just pick up and leave . Besides fearing any precedent that might be set by caving in to political pressures , they have $1. 8 billion in South African assets at risk ( down sharply from $2. 6 billion in 1981 ) . Also at stake is the livelihood of U.S. companies ' employees  --  especially 47 , 000 blacks or 0. 8% of South Africa ' s 6. 1 million black workers . The interdependence of U.S. units there makes it even tougher ; a company won ' t leave if the companies it serves aren ' t shutting down as well . " If our clients are committed to staying there , we ' re committed to staying there , " says Eugene Beard , executive vice president of Interpublic Group Inc. , whose advertising agencies bill $100 million a year in South Africa and handle Coca-Cola , General Motors and Unilever products world-wide . He says a black employee lives at the South African headquarters for fear of being killed by radical blacks back in his home township . But Mr. Beard is optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a marvelous country . " Others aren ' t so sanguine . " My pessimism comes from what the government of South Africa does or doesn ' t do , " says Ursula Fairbairn , an IBM staff director overseeing the issue . " We all watch the same events in South Africa , " she says . " We are all human beings . It ' s pretty hard not to respond when people there are suffering . " So touchy is the topic that IBM first agreed to an interview only " on background ; " later it produced a transcript and marked the relatively safe comments that could be used on the record . In cautious statements that may be clearing a way out , IBM says it will stay so long as it can practice its principles of fairness , turn a profit and be " together with others a force for change . " The outlook seems bleak for all three criteria . IBM recently reduced its work force in South Africa by about 300 because of declining business . But leaving would mean laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 200 blacks ) , marring a 72-year record of never having had a real layoff . By adopting the Sullivan Code , now followed by 196 U.S. companies , businesses have let the issue move to moral rather than purely business grounds . Now the principles  --  and businesses ' lukewarm dedication to them  --  are under attack , and the companies are criticized for not doing enough . At the recent New York meeting , black South Africans told executives the Sullivan Code has a " tattered image , " that enforcement has been placed in " malicious hands " and that the tenets have " failed dismally to reach their original objectives . " The code is unknown to employees and the black population because companies don ' t tell people about it . Embarrassingly few blacks are involved in the Sullivan process , much less in top management of the companies . Mr. Sullivan has called on U.S. subsidiaries to fill 50% of their open management positions with blacks , but a study says the actual rate is only 14% . Managers of five companies say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' correct ' words , " Richard Sowazi , a black South African , told executives at Mr. Sullivan ' s gathering . " But surreptitiously , " he added , they " take every safe opportunity to sabotage efforts to communicate with their employees . " He cited eight Sullivan task forces involving 58 people , but only six of them black . " Where are all the blacks ? Where are they ? " he demanded . Since 1977 , Sullivan-signee companies in South Africa have spent a combined total of $158 million on housing , health and education  --  only 76 cents per person each year for 23 million blacks , and even less if other non-white groups are counted . The spending now is about $20 million a year . " Whatever money they give away , " says Mr. Clark of the Signatory Association , " you think they wouldn ' t unless somebody were forcing them . Would you pay taxes unless you had to ? " Company efforts do sometimes look petty : Mr. Clark says he insists on using a black travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he urges other companies to do the same . Some question whether any spending level can improve the lot of South Africa ' s blacks , win their support and ensure good relations with a post-apartheid government . " It ' s a waste of money , " says one executive who recently visited the country . " There is no appreciation in the black community any longer for the money spent . Black leaders look at it as dirty money . " He says companies won ' t boost their social spending with the economy in shambles and with Mr. Sullivan threatening an embargo next year . " Forget it  --  it ain ' t gon na happen . " Nor do U.S. companies hold much hope for pressuring the South African government in response to Mr. Sullivan ' s calls for blatant corporate civil disobedience . IBM says it " quietly " violates apartheid laws when needed , but others say the civil disobedience he urges will get companies thrown out . South Africa lacks the lobbying channels that are common in the U.S. , and companies risk further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a government that refuses to talk with black leaders . Says one South Africa-based executive : " The closer you are to government , the more credibility you lose in the black community . It ' s very difficult to serve several masters at once . " It is uncertain what companies will do if Mr. Sullivan holds to his May 1987 deadline . He may be bluffing : A mass withdrawal would render his principles irrelevant and scotch 10 years of hard work . But others say he isn ' t . Mr. Sullivan , at his private session with executives recently , said that by year-end he will have specific plans ready for a pullout . " We will meet again in December , " the minister told the businessmen . " And we will see what we will see.
