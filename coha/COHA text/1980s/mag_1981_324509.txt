No issue since Afghanistan has exacerbated differences in the Communist world as much as Poland . For months Enrico Berlinguer 's inde pendent-minded Partita Comunista Italiano had become ever bolder in its sup port for Poland 's independent unions . In a communique last December , it even warned the Kremlin of " extremely grave consequences " in the event of a Soviet invasion-meaning that the P.C.I , might break with Moscow altogether . Last week , in a rare public display of a Communist family quarrel , the Soviet Communist Party was revealed as having blasted Berlinguer in no uncertain terms . The Italian weekly Panorama published a confidential letter from the Soviet Cen tral Committee , obviously with the imprimatur of Leonid Brezhnev , rebuking the Italians for showing too much solidarity with Solidarity . <P> The letter , said to have been handed to Berlinguer by a Soviet embassy official in late December , begins " Dear Comrades " and signs off with " Fraternal Greetings " - but that is the extent of the cordiality . Taking a swipe at the inde pendent Polish unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siding with them . The P.C.I . ' s December communique , it noted , did not " support the socialism that actually exists in Poland but shows solidarity with those forces that have unleashed a real and serious offensive against Polish socialism . " Sounding a familiar chord , the Soviet party leadership wondered if this was not " interference in the internal affairs of Poland . " <P> Neither of the two parties challenged the document 's authenticity ; but each denied having leaked it . In Moscow , Party Spokesman Leonid Zamyatin told reporters that " your best sources would be in Rome . " Ital ian Communist Party officials were equally evasive , hinting that the Kremlin might have leaked the letter to discredit Berlinguer in the eyes of hard-line party members . Panorama Journalist Carlo Rossella added to the mys tery , explaining that he had been given a translation of the letter at a surreptitious meeting in a Milan restaurant . But he refused to identify the informant . <P> With the Soviet Communist Party 's 26th Congress set to open in Moscow this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow and Rome Communists . Berlinguer made it clear that he would not bend before blunt Moscow messages . " We will stick to our road , whatever the initiatives or in comprehensions of other Communist parties might be , " he told a crowd of Communist employees in Turin last week . Clearly that road would not lead to Mos cow . P.C.I , officials confirmed that Berlinguer , for the first time , would be absent from the Italian delegation at world Communism 's quinquennial pageant .
