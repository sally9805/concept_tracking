An ecumenical committee reworks 313 Bible passages <P> To feminist critics of Holy Scripture , there is something grievously wrong with the beginning of the Twenty-Third Psalm in traditional translation . " The LORD is my shepherd " has a distinctly male aura to it . Far better , say the critics , to render David 's words in a neutral way : " God is my shepherd . " Similarly , sexism is allegedly rampant in the commandment given to Moses , " You shall not covet your neighbor 's wife . " Fairness would dictate an even-handed condemnation by adding " or husband . " <P> These are just two examples from a new antisexist rendering of hundreds of widely known biblical texts that was issued last week by the National Council of Churches. * The aim of the balanced ( six men , six women ) committee that prepared the translations was to rid Holy Writ of the " male bias " that supposedly runs through both the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures and subsequent English translations . This means expunging any references to a male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father " and masculine pronouns like " he . " Says Committee Member the Rev. Sharon Ringe of the Methodist Theological School in Delaware , Ohio : " Much hurt is caused by oppressive speech . " <P> The N.C.C . book is the second installment of a three-part revision of Bible readings for Christian worship , known as a lectionary . The suggested readings , billed as " provisional , experimental and responsible , " are based on the Revised Standard Version of the Bible , which will have its own , considerably less radical , degendered language in a forthcoming edition . <P> The first of these experimental readings was greeted warmly a year ago by feminists but drew catcalls from many scholars and admirers of the traditional language of the Bible . At a noisy N.C.C . board meeting last November , conservatives failed to force the council to disown the project . The new selection of 313 readings-covering 62 of the 150 Psalms and 42 other books-makes no concessions to the critics . <P> As it did last October , the committee uses brackets to denote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bible . Beyond that , the committee has banished some passages now deemed offensive , such as Paul 's teaching on marriage in Ephesians 5 ( " Wives , be subject to your husbands , as to the Lord " ) . The committee excised verses from 7 Corinthians 6 in which Paul assails Christian men who use prostitutes , presumably because women are portrayed as sex objects . <P> Jews may be interested in the version of their central confession of faith from Deuteronomy ( known as the Sh ' ma ) as Jesus recites it in Mark : " Hear , O Israel : The Sovereign our God , the Sovereign is one . " In Acts 3 , in the interests of domestic balance , the customary list of Hebrew patriarchs is augmented by the names of their wives : " The God of Abraham and Sarah , of Isaac and Rebekah , of Jacob , Leah and Rachel .
