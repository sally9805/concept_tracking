It depends on what you call him . That 's what tells Steven Van Zandt how long you 've been a fan . <P> Admittedly , the flurry of nicknames , second names and stage names can get a bit confusing , especially since Van Zandt is the kind of rock star people just enjoy shouting out to . Walking around Times Square ( " my office " ) , near his home base in Manhattan , he cuts a striking figure in fringed leather , high boots and a trademark bandanna wrapped around his head , an urban swashbuckler whose frigate just got towed away for double parking . " Hey , Miami ! " yell a couple of citizens cruising by in a Chevy convertible . He waves and shouts back as the car runs a light at Broadway . " Miami , " Van Zandt sighs . " That means they still know me from Bruce . " <P> That also means they have not heard his new album yet . But after May 15 , when Freedom  --  No Compromise is released by Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some lingering uncertainty is understandable . Frustrating , maybe , but understandable . <P> Van Zandt , after all , did spend a formative and formidable nine years as Miami Steve , the driving force and antic soul man of Bruce Springsteen 's E Street Band . His guitar was the band 's bedrock , and his harmonies with Springsteen were communions of friendship with the audience and with Bruce . He was at Springsteen 's side during the first days of major glory in the mid- ' 70s , when stardom broke so heavily , and he was there for the years of uncertainty and renewed triumph that followed . Van Zandt did some outside record producing during that time too , calling himself Sugar Miami Steve on one of his albums for Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes . By the time he officially left Springsteen in 1984 , he had taken another name , Little Steven , and was trying to stand in his own light . Bruce , however , cast a heavy shadow . <P> Van Zandt had helped produce three of Springsteen 's hottest-selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " U.S. " Bonds , like Daddy 's Come Home , showed high-end gifts for songwriting , even though he insists , " I hate all ballads , including my own . " Still , it was impossible to flourish on his own and hang in with the gang . " I felt , " he says , " a more urgent necessity pulling me . Like , ' Hey , it 's time to find out if you got something else to contribute here on this planet . ' " Men Without Women , his first Little Steven album , released in 1982 , was a New York song cycle about hard life on the city streets . The songs were fervent , and the Disciples of Soul blasted behind Van Zandt like a garage band concertizing on top of a pizza oven . Voice of America , released in 1984 , was a startling change-up , an album full of impassioned and informed political songs . Neither record sold well , though . It took Sun City for Van Zandt to get a little commercial territory he could call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldest political anthem of the ' 80s , it was also the funkiest . Besides writing the song , Van Zandt was the main man behind the album , the video and the documentary about Sun City , which brought hard rock together with hard facts about South African politics . Freedom  --  No Compromise continues that same tough tradition of humanist ideology and high steppin ' . " The trickiest part is not to be rhetorical , " Van Zandt says , " but to make the songs into an emotional , human communication . "
