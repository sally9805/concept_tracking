He attended two second-rate church schools , a boarding academy and a seminary . Raised in a German-speaking home , he entered Yale Divinity School in 1913 still struggling to master English . When he joined the faculty of New York City 's Union Theological Seminary in 1928 , the Old Guard grumbled because this novice with the Midwest twang had no doctorate . He raised eyebrows when he wore a rumpled suit to a tuxedos-only reception and poured hollandaise over his entire artichoke instead of dipping the leaves into the sauce . <P> The " uncouth country bumpkin with decidedly dubious scholarly credentials , " as Historian Richard Fox characterizes him , was the young Reinhold Niebuhr . Over the next four decades he was to become the nation 's best-known theologian and political preacher , his Teutonic scowl etched on the face of 20th century American Protestantism . <P> Despite his stature , there has until now been no full-dress biography of Niebuhr , who died in 1971 at age 78 . Fox , who teaches at Oregon 's Reed College , fills the gap with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week by Pantheon ( 340 pages ; $19.95 ) . It is an admirable work , appreciative but not uncritical , enriched but not burdened by meticulous research . Though Niebuhr 's ideas are skillfully woven into the story , Fox offers a life , not a theology text . <P> The son of an immigrant clergyman , Niebuhr first won national notice , fresh out of Yale , as the pastor of Detroit 's Bethel Evangelical Church between 1915 and 1928 . He rebelled against the older clergy in his German Evangelical denomination , agitating for Americanization of the church and supporting U.S. entry into World War I against Germany . " I am getting to be a violent American patriot , " he confessed to a friend . <P> Niebuhr 's strategy of reaching beyond the confines of Detroit 's German community helped swell Bethel 's membership sixfold in the years after the war . There was another lure : the pastor 's preaching . He was , writes Fox , " the educated Protestant 's Billy Sunday , " who would " strut , gyrate , jerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niebuhr 's hand when he took on Henry Ford , castigating the legendary automaker and other industrialists . He ended up a thoroughgoing Christian Socialist , evoking the biblical prophets and a bit of Marx as he thundered against the exploitation of labor . <P> From Detroit , Niebuhr traveled around the country on one social crusade after another . After moving to Union seminary , he remained as much preacher as scholar and commonly taught his last Friday class with a packed suitcase behind the lectern so he could rush off to weekend speaking engagements . <P> The Union years saw head-spinning political changes in Niebuhr . Although he ran for Congress on the Socialist ticket , he later came to accept the capitalism , tempered by welfare programs , of the New Deal . Niebuhr led the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation , but later railed against isolationist clergy and supported America 's entry into World War II . <P> Unlike many leftists , he was notably consistent in distrusting Communism as dogmatic and needlessly violent . After World War II , Niebuhr became a kind of intellectual chaplain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organized evil which spreads terror and cruelty throughout the world . " These views did not preclude the FBI from subjecting him to a " full-field " loyalty investigation .
