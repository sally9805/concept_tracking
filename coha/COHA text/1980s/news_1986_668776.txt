Dear Abby : I have a 40-year-old brother ( I ' ll call him Ned ) who is a convicted rapist . After serving a prison sentence on that charge , he was released , and then he sexually molested his 11-year-old stepdaughter . He is now in jail on that charge , but he ' ll be out soon . My mother insists to this day that Ned is innocent  --  and in both cases it was the girl ' s fault ! I have a 6-year-old daughter , and I don ' t want Ned anywhere near my house or my daughter . I would rather have her think she has no uncle . This is causing me no end of problems . I ' m afraid to let my mother baby-sit for my daughter for fear Ned will come over . To complicate matters , I offered to rent my upstairs to my aunt ( my mother ' s sister ) , and when she found out I didn ' t want Ned around , she hit the roof . She said I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in her apartment , he ' s in my house . I fear him because I don ' t trust him . I would rather not break ties totally with my mother and her family , but I feel like I ' m being backed into a corner . Please give me some objective advice . Pennsylvania Problem Dear Problem : Your reasons for not wanting your brother near your home or your daughter are valid , and you have an obligation to do whatever is necessary to protect your daughter . Hold firm and don ' t give an inch ! Dear Abby : In the fall , my mother-in-law is moving into a small apartment directly behind our home . We will share a common yard and gardens . The woman is very nice , and even though elderly , is very self-sufficient . The problem : our privacy . My husband and I have been married for only a year and a half . I know his mother won ' t be pestering us all the time , but I ' m trying to find a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need arise . My husband and I both realize that we must extend certain " courtesies " from the very beginning , but how do we inform his relatives that just because they come to visit his mother doesn ' t necessarily mean that our doors are always open to them ? His mother loves to talk , and I don ' t relish being " cornered " in the yard for hours listening to her go on and on about things I have no interest in . Would it be advisable to lay down some ground rules for my mother-in-law and her family right from the start ? Starting to Worry Dear Starting : Yes , but do it with a minimum of militancy and a maximum of diplomacy . As my sainted mother used to say : You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar . Dear Abby : I ' m in my late 60s and profoundly deaf , but that is not my worst problem . I have a severe case of tinnitus , which is a chronic ringing sensation in my ears . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad LSD trip without the psychedelic visions . They last sometimes as long as four days . You , like most people , will probably think I ' m a nut case . I hear music or singing , or both . The same compositions over and over . My last attack was a duet with a mezzo and a bass baritone . ( Incidentally , the bass baritone was wonderful ! ) Now , you probably think I am a nut for sure . Would you be good enough to consult one of your authorities to verify the fact that I am not crazy ? I believe that would be an otorhinolaryngologist . The very small town in which I live does not have such a specialist . Hoping you can help me . . . Hearing Things in York , S.C. Dear Hearing : The American Tinnitus Association , P.O.
