" If any memorial is erected to me , I know exactly what I should like it to be , " Franklin D. Roosevelt once remarked to a friend . " I should like it to consist of a block about the size of this desk and placed in the center of that green plot in front of the Archives building . I do n't care what it is made of , whether limestone or granite or whatnot , but I want it plain , without any ornamentation , with the simple carving ' In memory of . . . ' " <P> A group of friends and associates carried out Roosevelt 's wish and installed a 3-ft. by 6-ft. block of marble , suitably inscribed , in front of the Archives building , which is about halfway between the White House and the Capitol . But in a city where the care and feeding of monuments is a serious industry , many felt that F.D.R. deserved a more lofty and visible memorial . And so , in 1955 , in the noblest Washington tradition , Congress established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> 1959 . After four years of getting organized , the twelve-member Memorial Commission acquired a site , 27 acres in West Potomac Park , alongside the river , near the cherry trees and the Jefferson Memorial . <P> 1960 . The American Institute of Architects , which had been asked to help run a competition for a proper memorial , announced that the winner among 547 entries was an abstract grouping of large stone forms , designed by the firm of Pedersen &; Tilney . <P> 1962 . After considerable soul searching , the commission formally accepted the design . But amid much public criticism of the " Instant Stonehenge , " the Washington Commission of Fine Arts vetoed the choice . Congress passed a resolution ordering the Memorial Commission to do better . <P> 1964 . Pedersen &; Tilney simplified its design . Both the Memorial Commission and the Fine Arts Commission approved the new version , but critics began calling it Son of Instant Stonehenge . <P> 1965 . The Pedersen &; Tilney project was abandoned . The Memorial Commission sought a new architect . <P> 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Architect Marcel Breuer , a prominent member of the Bauhaus school . <P> 1967 . The commission approved Breuer 's plan for a pinwheel of granite walls flanked by narrow pools . <P> 1968 . The Fine Arts Commission unanimously rejected the Breuer plan as too extreme an intrusion on the park . <P> 1969 . The Memorial Commission reduced the site for the F.D.R. monument from 27 acres to twelve . <P> 1970 . The commission decided to honor F.D.R. with a rose garden , but monument lovers objected that this would not be monumental enough . <P> 1974 . The commission found a new designer , Lawrence Halprin of San Francisco , who specializes in water fountains . <P> 1975 . The commission approved Halprin 's plan for a zigzagging 14-ft. granite wall that would connect a series of fountains , plantings , sculptures and quotes from F.D.R. 's speeches . <P> 1978 . Halprin submitted his final design , and all commissions approved . Proposed cost : $23 million . Maintenance cost : $750,000 per year .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
