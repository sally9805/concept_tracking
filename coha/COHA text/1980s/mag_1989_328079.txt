Is Raisa Gorbachev becoming the prima donna of perestroika ? In rare coverage of the Soviet leader 's wife , TASS quoted her last week as she spoke out on her husband 's reforms and the role of women in world peace at a Moscow reception honoring International Women 's Day . " Soviet people are putting into practice plans of revolutionary restructuring , " the Soviet First Lady said . " We want our public life . . . to be worthy of a human being . " <P> Observers credit Mrs. Gorbachev 's new prominence to both glasnost and her % natural self-confidence . But not all Soviets approve of Raisa 's high profile . Groused one Muscovite : " What is the meaning of Raisa this , Raisa that ? Am I supposed to live like she does ? " At a televised celebration at the Bolshoi Theater after her speech , it was clear that she has not totally broken the traditional mold of Soviet leaders ' spouses . Mikhail Gorbachev sat on the dais , while Raisa watched from the audience .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
