THE LITTLE FOXES by Lillian Hellman <P> Presence sometimes takes precedence over performance . That is the case here . Elizabeth Taylor displays more confidence than craft in her Broadway acting debut at the Martin Beck Theater , not that her acting is less than competent . But the audience is not intent on watching her act ; it is absorbed in watching her . <P> At 49 , she is something to watch . In air and bearing , she possesses regal command . Her arrant good looks , particularly those thrush-startled violet eyes , fix all other eyes upon her . On glimpsing her , Poe might have written his poem " To Helen " apostrophizing the most beguiling beauty of the ancient world . QE3 ( as someone recently nicknamed Taylor ) conjures up that grace and grandeur . <P> Regina is a role that permits her to be both sex-and bitch-goddess , to range from coquetry to carnage . Since The Little Foxes is an out-and-out melodrama , it relies on manipulated emotions and Taylor need not probe authentic feelings . Like all melodramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing villains , crying over victims and cheering on heroes . <P> The joint villain is the Hubbard clan , a trio of plunderers in magnolia land . The family trade is cotton ; its god is greed . The younger brother , Oscar ( Joe Ponazecki ) , is a man with a sycophantic spirit and an ugly habit of slapping his genteel , alcohol ic wife Birdie ( Maureen Stapleton ) . The older brother , Ben ( Anthony Zerbe ) , is a cigar-chomping Machiavelli . As their sister Regina , Taylor salivates in her lust for wealth , power and position . <P> The big chance for the big bucks comes when a wily Chicago entrepreneur ( Humbert Allen Astredo ) offers the trio a deal to build a cotton mill if the Hubbards will share the costs . The hitch is that Regina 's share lies in the bank vault of her husband Horace ( Tom Aldredge ) , who is precariously ill in a Baltimore hospital . He loathes the Hubbards for their vulpine avarice and has long been estranged from Regina . She sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to haul him back , and proceeds to cajole and curse him , but Horace is adamant . <P> An insipid but reptilian nephew , Oscar 's son Leo ( Dennis Christopher ) , raids the bank vault and thwarts his uncle . As Horace cradles the all but empty bank box , Regina goads him into a heart spasm and icily denies him the lifesaving pills that are just beyond his reach . After a few more calculated turns of Lillian Hellman 's plot screws , Regina proves to be more fearsome than any little fox . <P> Without dimming Taylor 's starshine , Stapleton pilfers top acting honors . As she portrays " 22 years without a day of happiness , " she is not tearjerking but heart rending . Aldredge comes in a close second . As Horace , he raises his feeble but valiant arm in a salute to the values of the Old South that is being displaced by the New . The throngs who jam the box office may not care . They have booked passage on the QE3 , and on its maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail till Labor Day . <P> - By T.E.Kalem
