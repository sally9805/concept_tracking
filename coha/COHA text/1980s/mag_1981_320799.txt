George Voinovich , 44 , is a shy man who shuns the headlines . Yet late last month , after a year and a half in city hall , the slight , sandy-haired Republican mayor of Cleveland indulged himself in a bit of well-earned whimsy . At a Cleveland Indians ' home game against the New York Yankees , Voinovich showed up wearing a garish T shirt under his neat sports coat . NEW YORK 'S THE BIG APPLE , proclaimed the shirt , BUT CLEVELAND 'S A PLUM . Breaking out in a sheepish grin , he then tossed a real plum to the Indians ' catcher . <P> If Cleveland is a sweet plum of a town to live in these days , it is due largely to Voinovich . Three years ago , the city was strictly persimmon as it puckered its way through an attempt to recall its abrasive Democratic child-mayor , 31-year-old Dennis Kucinich . Then , in December 1978 , Cleveland failed to pay $15 million of its debt , thus becoming the first major U.S. city to default since the 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless managed to trounce Kucinich by a vote of 56% to 44% in 1979 . " I 've got work to do , " said Voinovich after his election . " My war will be to save one of this country 's greatest cities . " <P> Work he did . Voinovich quickly made peace with the city 's business community and persuaded eight local banks to buy back $10.5 million in defaulted notes and lend the city another $25.7 million at 8 ? % interest . He also launched a campaign to prop up the city 's faltering services by asking voters last November to approve a % increase in the city 's income tax . When the measure lost , the mayor announced a host of budget cuts and threatened not to run for a second term in 1981 . <P> <P> " During the 1970s , our taxes stayed low , our services declined and the city lost 24% of its population , " said Voinovich . " At that rate , the city will be extinct in the 21st century . " The voters got the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62% to 38% . <P> A native of Cleveland , Voinovich graduated from Ohio University and received his law degree from Ohio State . Despite Democratic domination of Cleveland , he won a series of elected posts : state representative , Cuyahoga County auditor , county commissioner and finally Lieutenant Governor under Republican James A. Rhodes . A penny pincher in private as well as public life , he lives with his wife Janet and three children in a modest frame house , and once bragged to a friend that he went five years without buying a new suit . He relishes his reputation for dullness ; aides joke that he is so low-profile no one can ever find him . Still crushed by the death of his nine-year-old daughter Molly in a 1979 auto accident , he spends as much time as possible with his family and reserves most Sundays for outings with them . <P> Not everyone gives Voinovich high marks . <P> " I do n't think anything has changed , except people are paying higher taxes , " grouses ex-Mayor Kucinich . Yet most observers rate Voinovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Not only is the budget balanced , but Voinovich proudly announced last month that the city was facing a $3.9 million surplus . Says Cuyahoga County Democratic Chairman Tim Hagan : <P> " Right now he is unbeatable . " Voinovich is already talking like a campaigner as he describes his dreams for the Big Plum . Says the mayor :
