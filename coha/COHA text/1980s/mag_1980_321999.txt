The current inflation has been largely fueled on credit ( as has U.S. prosperity ) . Collectively , Americans owe $150 billion in commercial bank loans , $115 billion in car loans and $29 billion on bank credit cards . Groping for new weapons to fight inflation , the Administration is taking a look at whether credit controls will help . The prospects are not good . <P> Under the never invoked Credit Control Act of 1969 , the President has the authority to ask the Federal Reserve Board to restrict bank lending and/or consumer borrowing in any of eleven specified ways , including flatly forbidding " any extensions of credit under any circumstances the board deems appropriate . " <P> Thus the President could ask the board to put a ceiling on the dollar amount of loans that any bank could make , or restrict particular types of loans , or accomplish the same purpose indirectly by regulating ratios of banks ' loans to their capital . He could ask that consumers be required to make larger down payments on purchases of houses , cars , refrigerators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the price more quickly . <P> Selective credit controls have been tried several times , most recently during the Korean War years , 1950-52 , but economic experts say that they had little measurable effect . As long as people have money to lend , borrowers will find a way to tap it .

Says J.H. Tyler McConnell , president of Delaware Trust Co. : " When you start to squeeze one area , the money just bursts out somewhere else . " Also , bankers argue , controls unfairly hurt small companies and low-income consumers who need credit the most . <P> The Administration seems convinced . It has been considering a number of possibilities , but the only significant step it is believed likely to ask the board to take is to impose some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower ceiling on the debt that a consumer could run up on a card , or require speedier repayment of outstanding balances .
