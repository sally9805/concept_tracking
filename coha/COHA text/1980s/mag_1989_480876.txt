From ' ' The Magic Ingredient in Politicians , " an essay by Esther V ilar , in The Power of Stupidity , published by Econ in Dusseldorf , West Germany . Vital- , who was born in Argentina and lived in West-Germany , now lives in New York City . She is the author of The Manipulated Man and The American Popess , a play . This essay was translated from the German by Joel Agee . NT That part does stupidity play in the quest for political power ? If those who are born into power are insensitive and unimaginative , what about those whom we freely elect to determine our fate ? Are they capable of governing intelligently ? And if not , why do we follow them ? Naturally , in order to arrive at a position where one can call the shots and tell others how to live their lives , a person has to show a certain talent for some particular activity ; but beyond that , one must possess the qualities of a climber and , eventually , those of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obedience , thoroughness , enthusiasm , goaldirectedness , a willingness to take risks , and finally , the not at all self-evident desire to tell people what they should and should not do : the joy of commanding , the will to power . We tend to think of these qualities as positive . We have heard their praises sung from earliest childhood , for most parents want their children to achieve something in life ? status or wealth or both . But is n't it by virtue of some well-concealed deficiency that a person usually rises to the top ' Are the qualities that support an illustrious professional career as admirable as we have been led to believe ? Knowledge is power : we learned that in school . But , as Karl Kraus said , a hollow head has room for a lot of knowledge . Diligence is a highly praised quality , but it also implies dedication to a single purpose at the expense of all others . Is n't such renunciation easiest for those who are n't tempted by anything else ? Who do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " capacity for teamwork , " implies a willingness to subordinate one 's own ideas . Does n't it stand to reason that obedience comes easiest to those who do n't have ideas of their own ? The thoroughness needed to become Number One in a particular field involves perpetual repetition , practice , and training to the point ofpossesses all these qualities in their purest form . What extraordinary discipline , thinks the sensitive homebody in front of his television set ; imagine the training it takes before you can handle a ball the way he does ! He must have sacrificed his childhood , his youth , to achieve this . Just look at that crazy guy , racing along the ice like that , what courage ? one wrong move and he 'll break his neck ! My , look at so-and-so , cutting corners at such speed ? one tiny mistake and he will trade his Porsche for a wheelchair ! For he , the observer , presumes that this athlete is as imaginative as he is . And since he can not conceive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion in order someday to swim , ride , pedal , or drive a fraction of a second faster than a certain other person , he admires his hero for the torturous discipline he imposes on himself . Since he himself is afraid of death and is fully capable of imagining life in a wheelchair with all its humiliating details , he presumes that his champion feels the same fear , and he envies him his courage . And when , after beating the odds and all his opponents , the champion steps before the television camera , still out of breath but perfectly calm , and speaks in clear , modest sentences about his strategy for the event , the observer admires him even more . Imagine being that levelheaded , that cool , just once in your life ! He never will . He may bask in some of his hero 's reflected glory ? acquire his triple-striped jersey , his tennis racket , his skis , or his car ? anything but his daily routine , because for that , he 's just not simpleminded enough . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His store of capital is in his body , and its funds are not renewable ; the glory is gone the moment a younger man takes away his crown . He may want to earn a lot of money , but he 's not after power . And perhaps that is what makes him so appealing : his great effort garners him so little profit compared with what he might have achieved in another realm . But a person who invests as much energy in shaking hands , calculating profits , or exercising troops is dangerous . For if he is lucky and we are not , the same qualities that lifted the great athlete to his pinnacle for a brief season will entrench the career politician for half a century in a position of power that , as a rule , remains off-limits to the person who should occupy it for the benefit of all the man or woman of imagina-tion , sensitivity , and intelligence . Anyone whose political conscience impels him to attend party congresses , read interviews with the candidates , or follow their activities on TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women can stand the lives they lead . How does a person manage to swim in a sea of hollow phrases for years ? How does he generate his undiminishing fervor in defense of a party program that is constantly changing ? How can he bear mouthing all those promises that he knows he can never keep ? Why is your average politician willing to embrace even the most farfetched belief system if he thinks it will make him seem like more of a regular guy ? Every election year you can observe gentle-men of the bluest blood fraternizing with soot-smeared miners as if those moments were the fulfillment of all their dreams , and skinny bu-reaucrats paying homage to baseball stars as if the next home run would determine the course of history . Those who address senior citizens speak of the fruits of experience , while those who turn to the young say we should follow the example of youth . A candidate addressing en-trepreneurs deplores the insatiable demands of the work force ; addressing the workers a day or two later , he 'll condemn the greed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charade , shaking hands , patting backs , forming friendships . Ask-ing questions that no one answers . Offering answers that no one hears . Now why , asks the thoughtful citizen , why notice their own banality ? Or is their banality a prerequisite for seeking that activity in the first place ? Are the people as stupid as those who would like to govern them seem to assume ? Or are the latter so stupid that they do n't notice that the people are smarter than they are ? Are those who finally succeed elected because there is no one better to fill the job ? Or are people of superior ability eliminated from the start by the limited imagination of the voting masses ' Does the democratic process consist of having the candidate adopt the voters ' opinion ? And if not , how does the politician arrive at his own ? When would he have time to think , since he spends his days and nights at meetings and rallies ? How can he set policy for the future of his country if he does n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should he allow his feelings to develop if he will have to suppress them later ? And if he possessed any imagination at the start of his career , would he not have to silence it , since it would almost certainly impede his progress ? Does the fate of the citizens of Western countries lie in the hands of those who possess neither imagination nor sensitivity , since , if they did , they could never have allowed their inner lives to be plundered for the sake of power and influence ? Is it possible that those who so vigorously plead for the right to assume responsibility on our behalf can no longer even imagine what that word means ? Are not those who are supposed to guarantee us a lasting peace ultimately too unimaginative to even consider the consequences of a war ? In other words , is our political fate at the mercy of a power that , in the final analysis , is nothing more than the power of stupidity ?                @ @ @ @ @
