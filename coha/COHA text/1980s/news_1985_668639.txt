A Wisconsin forklift operator who says he fathered a child during a one- night encounter in Waukegan has been allowed to intervene in a Divorce Court case to seek custody of the girl while her parents accuse each other of child abuse . James Wagner , 23 , of Oshkosh , was allowed to enter the custody battle between a Harwood Heights couple after his lawyer said blood tests showed a " 99 1/2 percent " likelihood that he is the biological father of the 3- year-old . In a telephone interview , Wagner said he met the woman in 1980 at a Waukegan party to celebrate his uncle ' s wedding anniversary . Wagner said he and the woman , Linda Erber , 23 , engaged in lengthy conversation and , after an automobile ride , had sex . Wagner said he then returned to Oshkosh and forgot about the incident . But he said that Mrs. Erber went to the Waukegan uncle ' s home again last Thanksgiving , and the uncle said of the young girl : " That looks like a Wagner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborer , and his estranged wife , a secretary , were married in December , 1980 , after Mrs. Erber ' s encounter with Wagner . A daughter , Jennifer , was born in July , 1981 . During divorce and custody proceedings , which began in May , 1983 , and which have contained charges and countercharges of child abuse , custody of the girl and a brother , Brian , 2 , has reverted from the mother to the father . The parentage of the younger child is not in dispute , and both parents also are seeking custody of him . In documents filed Tuesday , Wagner contended that he is the biological father of the girl because of the encounter with Mrs. Erber a few weeks before her marriage . Wagner said Mrs. Erber told his uncle during her visit last November that she was seeking a divorce from her husband and that she had had a sexual encounter with Wagner . Wagner said he went to Waukegan to see the child after the uncle called to explain the situation . " I couldn ' t remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , I knew it was a Wagner , because it had the same eyes , hair and nose features , " Wagner said . In an answer to Wagner ' s motion , Mrs. Erber admitted to the sexual liaison and conceded that Wagner probably is the father . Wagner said he has entered the case because of the child abuse charges . If no abuse is proved , he said , he is willing to let the court decide on custody . " If the evidence shows that they didn ' t abuse the child , then I would be satisfied with it . I just don ' t want the abuse to occur , " Wagner said . But he said that if it is decided that the girl has been mistreated , he wants custody of her . He said he lives in Oshkosh with his parents , two sisters and three brothers , so there would be ample care for the child , though he is single . Erber ' s attorney , Howard Augustus , said that in initial divorce documents , Mrs. Erber said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling in favor of Wagner would " bastardize " the children.
