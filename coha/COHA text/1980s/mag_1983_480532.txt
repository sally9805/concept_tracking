THERE IS A SENSE in which the split occurred in the beginning ? at the moment of genesis , when the first atomic bomb illuminated the nighttime New Mexico sky at Trinity site . " Some wept , a few cheered . Most stood silently , " J. Robert Oppenheimer said of the varied reactions of the atomic scientists to their creation . Oppenheimer would later call to mind the Hindu scriptures to describe his impression of the bomb ? the passage from the Bhagavad Gita where Vishnu takes on his multi-armed form and says , " I am become death , the destroyer of worlds . " Oppenheimer 's remark would be taken as a symbol of the scientists ' remorse over the bomb . But on the morning of July 16 , 1945 , the attitude among the scientists ? Oppenheimer included ? was a mixture of wonderment and pride . Isador Rabi remembers Oppenheimer 's " highnoon strut " following the successful test . It was not until some minutes after the sight of the bomb had died away that Rabi began to develop goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , jumped for joy and embraced Oppenheimer at the moment of explosion . " Kisty " subsequently told a journalist that he believed the last thing seen by the last man on earth would be the incredible light of the bomb . Robert Oppenheimer 's brother Frank remembers wondering whether the deep-throated reverberation of the blast , whose echo continued to bounce off the surrounding mountains , would ever end . Standing atop the command bunker 10,000 yards south of ground zero , the physicist in charge of the test , Ken Bainbridge , had turned to Oppenheimer in the fading glow of the fireball . " Well , Opole , " he said , " now we 're all sons-of-bitches . " If Trinity opened a crack in the ranks of the atomic scientists , Hiroshima widened it . The creators of the bomb were of two minds about dropping it on Japan . Rabi had been saving a pair of bottles of expensive scotch to celebrate victory ? one for the fall of Hitler and one for japan . When Germany Gregg Herken is associate professor of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weapon : The Atomic Bomb in the Cold War 1945-50 ( Knopf ) . surrendered , he and his colleagues had only a short toast and went back to work on the weapon they expected would end the war . At Japan 's surrender the second bottle went unopened . Hearing news of the casualties at Hiroshima , Robert Wilson became physically ill . Shortly after the war Robert Oppenheimer left the lab at Los Alamos , telling friends that he thought it " should be given back to the Indians . " When Oppenheimer left , many of the original group of scientists went with him . Not every scientist at Los Alamos shared Oppenheimer 's sense of guilt over Hiroshima , however , or his view that , because of the bomb , the physicists " had known sin . " Ernest Lawrence , who had run the Berkeley cyclotrons that produced the uranium used in the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , pointedly revised Kisty 's dire prediction when he told a reporter that he believed the first human being at the moment of creation had probably seen what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Luis Alvarez , was another who felt no remorse about the bomb . Alvarez had been in a B-29 that accompanied the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima . His first reaction on seeing the black , roiling cloud that rose from Hiroshima was that the bomb had missed the target entirely . " It looked like it had landed on a forest , " Alvarez said . " I did n't see any sign of a city . " Ile remembers thinking that Lawrence would be furious when he learned that they had wasted all of his uranium blowing up trees . When Alvarez returned from the war , he was amazed at the change that had taken place in the mood of the scientists . " When I came back I felt like Rip Van Winkle . I felt I did n't know the people . Everybody was moaning and wringing their hands . " L AST APRIL the scientists who built the bomb returned to Los Alamos for a four-day commemoration of the founding of the lab forty years earlier . The reunion was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Directions in Physics and Chemistry " ? where the 50 atomic veterans would give papers on their current work unrelated to defense . The work of the Los Alamos National Laboratory , as it is now called , has diversified to include research into solar and fusion energy , microbiology , and space exploration . But the great majority of the lab 's work and its primary purpose remains the design of bombs for America 's nuclear arsenal . The museum at the lab notes matter-of-factly that two thirds of the nation 's nuclear weapons have been developed at Los Alamos . I learned of the upcoming anniversary from Isador Rabi , who knew of the book I was writing on the scientists and strategists of the atomic age . Rabi told me he thought it curious that neither the organizers of the reunion nor his former colleagues ? some of whom had been retired as scientists for years ? planned to discuss at the conference the old direction of physics and chemistry from which their fame had come . When he was invited to give a paper at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would depart from their theme . It was to be entitled " We Meant Well . " HE WELCOMING cocktail party in Fuller Lodge on the laboratory grounds on Wednesday evening was indistinguishable from the reunion of a class in which the alumni had almost all made good . The Lincoln Log bunkhouse with cathedral ceilings and wagon-wheel chandeliers was a relic of the boys ' school that Los Alamos had been before it became a lab . During the war it was the scientists ' social center . Arriving bachelors were initially billeted there . Couples who met and married at the lab held wedding receptions in the lodge . After Hiroshima it was also where the scientists had met to discuss the consequences of the bomb . Certainly the name most often mentioned was Robert Oppenheimer 's . " Oppie " had been the dominant figure at the lab , and a picture of him ? drink and cigarette in hand ? taken at one of the wartime lab 's notorious parties hung on the wall of the lodge that night . Nearly thirty years before the reunion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perhaps irretrievably embittered the split among the scientists , and caused most to form ranks behind either Oppenheimer or Edward Teller . The tension between the two men had been evident to co-workers at the lab almost from the time that Teller arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1943 . Oppenheimer had wanted Teller to work on the implosion method for the " Fat Man " atomic bomb . Teller , however , was already interested ? obsessed , some thought ? with the possibility of building the next generation of nuclear ' weapons , the " Super , " or hydrogen bomb . Teller had become so distracted by the idea of the Super that Oppenheimer finally had to give the work on the atomic bomb to another scientist . Some at the tab thought that Teller 's infatuation with : the Super was partly the result of a petulant , almost childish unwillingness to subordinate himself to Oppenheimer . A few accused Teller of megalomania . Teller allegedly told one physicist that he was " building an alarm clock ? one that would wake up the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict between Oppenheimer and Teller into the open . As head of a scientific General Advisory Committee to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission , Oppenheimer , with the majority , cautioned against building a hydrogen bomb . The scientists ' advice to the Truman administration was partially founded on doubts that the weapon would work , but their main objection had , be'en ethical . " It is necessarily an evil thing considered in any light , " Rabi and Nobel-prizewinning physicist Enrico Fermi wrote of the Super in a letter appended to the committee 's report to the president . Teller , Alvarez , and Lawrence , on the other hand , became avid and effective proponents of a crash program for the Super 's development in the wake of Russia 's successful atomic-bomb test in August 1949 . The following January , Truman sided with Teller 's group . A short time after that , the president also approved the creation of a new weapons laboratory at Livermore , California . Teller had argued that the scientists at Los Alamos remained too much under Oppenheimer 's spell and refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alamos charged that behind Teller 's avid lobbying for the Super and for a second lab was a cynical ambition to supplant Oppenheimer as the most influential scientist-in Washington . " I have quit the appeasers and joined the fascists , " one Los Alamos alumnus claims Teller told him . Both sides in the Oppenheimer ? Teller rivalry agree that the event that emotionally polarized the atomic scientists occurred in the spring of 1954 . Aware of Oppenheimer 's radical contacts as a student in the 1930s , and made newly suspicious by his opposition to the Super , AEC and other government officials began an investigation into his loyalty . The AEC hearings on whether Oppenheimer 's security clearance should be revoked became a test of the physicist 's character and a national cause cel ? bre . Teller 's appearance at the hearings on behalf of the government as a witness for the pros-ecution , in effect ? outraged the scientists for whom Oppie had always been a hero . It is debatable whether Teller 's testimony played that important a role in the panel 's verdict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of virtual academic exile at Princeton 's Institute of Advanced Studies . But it was the motivation of the attack on Oppenheimer that most alienated the scientists from Teller . " Teller put the knife in Robert 's back and twisted it , " Robert Wilson said at the reunion . 51 Oppenheimer 's friends disagree even today as to whether Teller actually intended to do the damage they believe he did . But there is no doubt that Teller did not expect the reception he would receive from former friends and colleagues for his testimony . Shortly after his appearance before the committee investigating Oppenheimer , Teller returned to Los Alamos for a reunion and scientific conference of the sort that would mark the fortieth anniversary . Outside Fuller Lodge he encountered Rabi and physicist Bob Christy . In his effusive manner of those days , Teller rushed up to Christy with his hand extended . Christy stared at the hand before wordlessly turning on his heel and walking away . Rabi told Teller , " I wo n't shake your hand either , Edward . " According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , Mici , left Los Alamos soon afterward . Painful as the alienation of his colleagues was to him personally , in subsequent years Teller argued that far more significant was the damage done to the country by the split among the atomic scientists . In a 1981 interview Teller told me that he thought the Oppenheimer case had destroyed the center in America 's scientific community . " What happened over the Oppenheimer case not only polarized the scientific community , " he said , " but brought about the situation that at least 90 percent of scientists , and probably more , considered it immoral to cooperate in any way with the military . " " Our present military weakness , " Teller believes , " goes back to those days . " ELLER ARRIVED late to the cocktail party at Fuller Lodge on the first evening of the fortieth reunion . Flashbulbs popped and many of the guests turned to look as he came in . One scientist near me remarked that Teller looked old and drawn . I thought the simple presence of Teller at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guests already suspected that Teller had an ulterior motive in attending . Since the election of Ronald Reagan , Teller had become a vocal and effective proponent of a socalled third generation of nuclear weapons . The atomic bomb had been the first generation . The Super was the second . The third generation would include such weapons as the EMP , or electromagnetic-pulse bomb , which could knock out enemy communications without killing people , and the laser and particlebeam weapons based in space , which had been the subject of Reagan 's so-called " Star Wars " speech the month before . Such weapons were said to be ideally suited to the new defensive nuclear strategy that Reagan had depicted in his speech as a " vision of the future which offers hope . " Ironically , Oppenheimer 's advocacy of just such a defense-oriented nuclear strategy as Reagan and Teller now urge was one of the reasons his loyalty had come under question in the 1950s . The idea had been eagerly resurrected in the 1980s , however , as a result of the nuclear stalemate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teller had hosted a dinner of prominent scientists in the White House on the evening of Reagan 's speech , at which many of the Nobel-prizewinning veterans of Los Alamos were conspicuously absent . It was not entirely incidental , a few guests at the cocktail party suggested , that Teller 's talk at the conference session on Friday concerned the establishment of a lunar laboratory . The first speaker at the opening session of the conference the next day introduced Isador Rabi , who was described as " everybody 's uncle . " A diminutive , almost pixielike man with a shock of white hair , Rabi , now eighty-five , is a figure of Los Alamos legend . It was he who won the betting pool the scientists had collected on the size of the Trinity explosion . The bets had ranged from Oppenheimer 's low estimate of a few tons of TNT to Wilson 's guess of 50,000 tons . One scientist who speculated that the test might blow up most of New Mexico chose not to bet . Even today Rabi refuses to divulge how he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 12,000 tons of conventional explosive . He turns the question aside with a characteristic twinkle and the advertising slogan of a hair tonic he remembers from his boyhood in New York : " We never tell our secrets . " Rabi stood beside the lectern and spoke slowly and softly at first , without notes . His talk consisted of personal reminiscences of the wartime lab that stressed the innocence and idealism of the scientists who were engaged in a crusade to save civilization from Hitler . Los Alamos then , Rabi said , had been " a new ? and mystical ? world . " He and others occasionally thought it " somehow immoral to have such a good time working on such a thing . " He remembered that the tension began just before the testing of the bomb . But he would not try to describe what the scientists saw at Trinity : " the effect was visceral " When he began to get goose bumps , he realized " that this was the end of one world and the beginning of another. - " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane of power and responsibility . How to live with this became an immediate problem ? not days afterward , but minutes afterward .... We had something to dedicate ourselves to . " Rabi felt that the scientists had ultimately dodged that responsibility . " There is no way for scientists to escape responsibility for turning their creation over to people who have no respect or appreciation for it , " he said in a rising voice . " People at that time understood this thing ? its nature ? much better than people understand it now . There was greatness then , folly now . It did n't take long before the argument surfaced that we had to protect the bombs . In the process the reason why we fought the war was forgotten . " The result of the scientists ' efforts , Rabi con-52 eluded , " is that nations are now lined up like people before the ovens of Auschwitz while we are trying to make the ovens more efficient " He paused , and then resumed in a soft voice . " We meant well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We gave the power away to people who did n't understand it and now it 's gotten out of our hands . We have to recover that . " When Rabi finished speaking , people in the auditorium immediately began to stand . At first he thought they were walking out in protest . His first reaction , he said later , was " Goddamn it , I 've blown it again ! " In fact , they were standing to applaud . One of the new generation of scientists at Los Alamos near me told a colleague that the standing ovation for Rabi was one of only three he had heard of at the lab . The first had been when Robert Oppenheimer came back to Los Alamos in 1964 to give a talk . The other occasion was recently , when Edward Teller had spoken there . URING THE LUNCH that followed , I asked Luis Alvarez what he had thought of Rabi 's speech . Alvarez said that he was glad Rabi had not apologized , as some scientists had , for Hiroshima . Alvarez had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuclear weapons . He had been with Lawrence and Teller on the day in November 1952 when the first hydrogen bomb was tested in the Pacific . The three men had agreed to meet at the Berkeley seismograph to see if Teller 's " alarm clock " would work . As soon as the needle on the instrument had jumped , Teller measured the squiggle on graph paper and did a quick calculation on his slide rule . He announced that the sire of the explosion had been the equivalent of 10 million tons of TNT ? almost a thousand times the size of the Trinity bomb . Teller told Alvarez the reason for this was that Washington had been threatening to cut off money for the H-bomb if the test did n't work . As a result , every time the bomb 's creators had discovered some possible way to make it more powerful they had included it in the design . " Everything worked , " Alvarez said simply . Along with Teller , he had lobbied for development of the Super and testified against Oppenheimer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the need for , and advisability of , developing the next generation of nuclear weapons . His reasons for opposing the current vogue in spaceage military technology are the same as those of other Los Alamos veterans ? " it 's destabilizing and it would n't work . " " The great thing about bombs is that they make people more cautious , " he says , discussing why nuclear weapons have not been used in nearly forty years . " The thought of starting a large war is going to disappear , " Alvarez predicts . In the future , hethinks , the prospect of a nuclear war with the Russians will be as unthinkable as a war between America and Canada or the reimposition of slavery . " People wo n't change thinking will . " The role that chance played ? or might have played ? in the history of the bomb was a frequent topic of conversation at the reunion . The cruiser Indianapolis , which carried the uranium heart of the Hiroshima bomb to the air-force base on the island of Tinian , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The B-29 bomber carrying the plutonium core for Fat Man developed engine trouble after leaving San Francisco and had to turn back . Niigata was the original target for Fat Man , but the B-29 carrying the bomb had to be diverted because of bad weather . The city was thus spared the fate of Nagasaki . Very early in the project , before Los Alamos , Teller calculated that the heat created by an atomic explosion might be enough to start the fusing of hydrogen atoms in the air and the oceans . If that happened , the earth would become a fiery , fiercely burning star . Work on the bomb stopped until two other scientists checked Teller 's calculations and assured themselves that the bomb would not set the world on fire . The question had come up again concerning the Super . In a colloquium that he gave at the lab , Teller upset a number of scientists when he announced that his calculations indicated that atmospheric ignition by a test of the Super was improbable " by a factor of ten . " How certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer came back ? with a " typical Teller leer , " said my informant ? that the calculations might be off by as much as a factor of ten . It was the confidence and innocence ? some thought recklessness ? of the early days that seemed in retrospect their most distinguishing characteristic . One physicist I spoke with described the mood at the lab then as a kind of " macho mentality . " His job had been to machine the plutonium core for the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki . At one point he had even held a piece of the spherical assembly in his hand ; he remembered that the shiny gray metal had felt warm to the touch . He was now an advocate , he said , of the nuclear freeze . ELLER 'S TALK on the lunar laboratory packed the house at the session on Friday afternoon but raised few eyebrows . The only military application for the moon base that he mentioned was its use as the eyes and ears of an advanced detection station able to warn of enemy-missile attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended once again his role in promoting the president 's March 23 proposal . " The bad ideas we can talk about ; the good ideas we can not , " he told reporters . " Reagan has been informed of a number 54 of feasible means of defense . These are secret . These we can not discuss . " In response to a question , Teller distributed the blame between the classification system and the press for what he said was the " disinformation " that most Americans had received on the proposal " On this point the American people are misled by our own press in a more beautiful manner than even the KGB could , " he said . At the reunion 's final cocktail party , Teller again stood somewhat apart , surrounded by those eager for him to sign their copies of a special fortiethanniversary edition of the history of Site Y ? the wartime name of the laboratory . He turned to find Frank Oppenheimer standing next to him . Robert 's brother had lost his job teaching physics at the University of Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics had caused him to be blacklisted at other colleges and he had survived by teaching high school science in a small New Mexico town . He is now director of the Exploratorium , a hands-on science museum for children in San Francisco . Oppenheimer seemed startled to find himself next to Teller , but the two men were in any case immobilized by the crush of people around them . They talked briefly over the noise in the lodge , shook hands , and then Oppenheimer moved away . I asked Teller whether his presence at Fuller Lodge and the passage of forty years meant that there had been a reconciliation among the scientists . " I am not the one to answer that question , " he said quietly . " I am reconciled . You will have to ask that question of others . " H r WAS AT the banquet on Friday night that the division in the scientists ' ranks took on tangible form . After cocktails at Fuller Lodge the guests walked across the street to the Los Alamos Community Building , past a silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garb and with mock wounds painted on their faces . One of the demonstration 's organizers had been a scientist at the lab during the war . For the most part the guests at the reunion ignored the demonstrators , though one white-haired physicist remonstrated with a young woman carrying a placard that read ONE BOMB IS TOO MANY . " One bomb was not enough , " he corrected her , " It took two . " The generation of demonstrators was just arriving ; the generation of scientists passing . A dinner speaker that evening told a good news ? bad news joke that the scientists laughed at a little self-consciously . The good news was that the fiftieth anniversary reunion would n't be as crowded . A dinner toast was made to those who could not be present . Gen. Leslie Groves , head of the Manhattan Project . which built the lab , had died in 1963 . ( Groves once called the scientists there the greatest bunch of prima donnas ever assembled in one place " ; they had referred to the overweight general behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Groves " a born malaprop , " but also " the power behind Oppie . " ) George Kistiakowsky , the physicist who jumped for joy at Trinity and later lived to regret his invention , had died of cancer the previous year . A new film at the Los Alamos museum ended with an interview of Kisty done shortly before his death . " Look , there 's only two ways this thing can end , " he had predicted . " Either there will be a nuclear war or there will be arms control with deep reductions on each side . " The absence most often discussed during dinner was Oppenheimer 's . A new library and study center were to be dedicated to his memory the next morning as the final ceremony of the reunion . There was a street named for Oppenheimer in Los Alamos but there was no building at the lab named for its founding and best-known director . Like the Fermi award , the naming of a library for " Oppie " seemed a symbolic act belatedly acknowledging that the prophet was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab 's directors since Oppenheimer made brief remarks at the banquet , The subject of Hiroshima was brought up by Harold Agnew , director from 1970-79 . Agnew came to notoriety during the Vietnam war when he suggested that small nuclear weapons be used to knock down bridges in North Vietnam . Some also blame Agnew 's congressional testimony for sabotaging the negotiations on the comprehensive nuclear-test ban that President Carter tried to revive in 1977 . Along with Alvarez , Agnew had been one of the scientists to go to the Pacific after the Trinity test , and had also flown in the bombing raid over Hiroshima . He spoke movingly of the young Americans he had gotten to know overseas who did not return home at war 's end . Concerning Hiroshima , Agnew told a story about two NATO officers , both of them veterans , whom he had met in Europe . One of the two , an Englishman , had asked the other , a German , how he had gotten his wooden leg . In the Battle of Britain , the German answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Agnew , had always felt about the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan . " Good , " the Englishman had said . " You bloody well deserved it . " Victor Weisskopf gave the formal after-dinner speech . He also spoke personally . He and his wife had initially looked forward to seeing old friends at the reunion , he said , but they had come to have mixed feelings when they realized that the subject of the bomb might never come up . He was relieved , he said , when Rabi 's speech had dispelled the illusion of a . class reunion and acknowledged the scientists ' role in creating what Weisskopf called " the craziest arms race in history ? one that future generations will regard as a virulent case of a collective mental disease . " " Vicki 's " speech was a cri de coeur . " My friends , all this is the outcome of our work , " he said at the end . " Can we be silent about it in our reunion ? " 55 The response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to strong and sustained ? but not unanimous ? applause . Almost all in the room eventually stood , though some standing chose not to applaud ? a pointed gesture of respect or of deference , not of agreement . After the speeches a petition ? the weapon of choice among scientists hoping to influence the government ? was passed around for the dinner guests to sign . Emphasizing the atomic scientists ' " special sense of responsibility , " the petition called for a mutual reduction of nuclear arms . Seventy of the hundred or more scientists present signed it . Some of those who refused , like Rabi , declined not out of principle but because of the vague wording or the equally vague purpose of the petition . Edward Teller politely demurred when he was asked to sign . One of the guests said that when Teller was approached a second time to sign he had warned that such a petition might mean war . A physicist who sat across from me at dinner said heatedly that he would sign when Soviet scientists produced a similar document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as representatives of a free people , American scientists had an obligation to take the initiative . The reluctant physicist remained unpersuaded , and the petitioner moved on to another table . HE DEDICATION ceremony the next morn-ing was anticlimactic . Teller was not evident at the dedication . ceremony . The speeches were mercifully short . As he had on the night of the banquet , Donald Kerr , the current director of the lab , gave a brief and almost apologetic endorse-ment of Reagan 's speech on space-age weaponry , reminding the scientists that historically they had always responded to a president 's summons to aid in the nation 's defense . He then pulled a rope that dropped the shroud from an upright granite slab that said J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER STUDY CENTER in raised letters . There was polite applause , and the ceremony ended . On the plane back to New York on Sunday morning I sat next to an employee of a company called TRW . He was working on countermeasures to EMP , he said , the electromagnetic pulse created by nuclear weapons that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse bomb " had appeared in newspapers that morning . TRW was in the forefront of such research , my seatmale boasted . Rabi and Teller were also on the flight , sitting in different sections . After one session at the conference they had been standing in front of the stage no more than ten feet apart , though perhaps neither realized it . I had asked Rabi then if he ever planned to speak to Teller again . He replied that he was " willing to let nature take its course , " but then he had moved away from Teller nonetheless . Just before the plane landed in Chicago , Teller got up from his seat and walked down the aisle , pausing for a few minutes to talk to Rabi . After the conversation Teller returned to his seat and got off in Chicago to catch a connecting flight to Washington . When we were in the air again , Rabi invited me back to sit with him and his wife , Helen . His brief talk with Teller had been pleasant and cordial enough , Rabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked for the first time in nearly thirty years change anything ? I asked Rabi . " Nothing has changed , " he answered . It was n't Teller 's testimony alone that had caused their rift . Rabi said that he was going to Germany the following month and that he had not forgotten what the Germans had done forty years ago . " But it is a different generation now . " His disagreements with Teller , on the other hand , remained strong . Teller 's role in promoting the Super still angered Rabi . The letter that he and Fermi had appended to the recommendation against the H-bomb had urged Truman ? if he did decide to proceed with the weapon 's development ? to approach the Russians simultaneously about a ban on testing the new bomb . " I blame myself a great deal for the H-bomb decision , " Rabi said on the plane . " I did n't go out and fight it , " I asked him what he thought of the responsibility of scientists in an era of Star Wars . Rabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in going through official channels . He spoke contemptuously of the " arms controllers . " " I 've stopped going to their meetings , " he admitted . " It 's obscene to get people accustomed to megadeaths . " " We have to talk to the country , " he said of the scientists . " I 've given up on Congress . " But he also thought that the problem was deeper than one that legislation or negotiations could solve . " The problem of this generation is that they lost human sympathy , " Rabi said . " They lost an understanding of their own selves , of their own meaning . There has been an atrophy of the imagination , a decline of the moral sense ? especially on the part of the scientists . Science , " he said , is being destroyed in this race to destruction . " Just before we landed in New York I asked Rabi for his reflections on the fortieth anniversary of the atomic scientists . He paused for a moment before replying . " The best spirits did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bohr , Kistiakowsky , Oppenheimer ? they did n't survive . " Rabi also thought that the comparison of the anniversary with a class reunion was misleading . " I 've yet to see a class that had that spirit , " he said , " or that was involved with such dreadful things . " Did he think that there was ever likely to he another gathering like that of the scientists at the wartime lab , with the same dedication and idealism ? Rabi 's response was unhesitating . " I hope not , " he said . " We had no doubts about what we were doing . "
