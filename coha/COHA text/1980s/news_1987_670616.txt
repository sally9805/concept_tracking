That may be bad news for those Europeans who think " Dynasty , " " Alf , " " Batman " and " I Love Lucy " do for the arts and entertainment what Chicken McNuggets do for cuisine . It is very good news , however , for Hollywood studios and independent producers , who find themselves with a vibrant and fast-growing market for their shows at a time when they dearly need a new revenue source. // And it may portend changes in some of the programming that Americans see at home. // Of course , " Dallas " and other quintessentially American shows have been hits abroad for many years . In the last several years , though , demand for American programming has soared as the broadcasting industry underwent major changes in Europe - by far the most important export market for Hollywood. // Once dominated by government-controlled channels that often put education and information ahead of entertainment , European governments are turning control of the airwaves over to the private sector , where the main concern is building audiences and attracting advertisers. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs , while in other nations , new , privately owned or government-controlled stations are being built from scratch . Those attracted to the business range from such media leaders as Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell to such entrepreneurs as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. // Programming in Europe has become nearly as eclectic as in the United States . Some is still aimed at those who might consider " Wheel of Fortune " - which has become popular in France - a sure sign of civilization ' s impending demise. // But there is also considerably more demand for shows that are relatively inexpensive to acquire and can attract mass audiences and advertisers - the gospel that has always guided America ' s entertainment factories. // Even more programming demand is expected as innovative systems that will broadcast programming directly to European homes via satellite gain viewers and win advertiser acceptance . Among the satellite systems now in their infancy are Mr. Murdoch ' s Sky Channel and a Scandinavian consortium called Scan Sat. // Already the changes are paying off for Hollywood . With more broadcasting outlets , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for top shows. // Consider " Knot ' s Landing , " the long-running hit from the Lorimar Telepictures Corporation . A year ago , Lorimar sold 13 episodes in France for between $12 , 000 and $15 , 000 each . This year , with one of three state-owned channels turned over to the private sector and another commercial channel and a pay channel starting up , Lorimar sold 150 episodes in France for about $50 , 000 each. // " In markets where you ' ve had only one or two stations , you now have four or five or six , " said Michael Jay Solomon , the Lorimar executive in charge of international sales . " It ' s had an enormous economic impact . " <> <> Expensive Productions // While most European broadcasters would like to produce more of their own programming , it is simply too expensive , especially for newer operations . Producing an hour-long drama in Europe would probably cost $500 , 000 an episode ; the cost of acquiring the rights to air the average first-run American show is less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major trade show known as Mipcom , held each October in Cannes , France , the total world export value for audiovisual products was $3. 1 billion in 1986 . Industry executives estimate that television represents at least $1 billion of that. // The United States accounts for 79 percent of overall film and television exports , and probably a similar percentage of television alone . Western Europe is the major customer , accounting for 56 percent of American film and television sales abroad . ( Britain is the only European country with a trade surplus in entertainment programming . ) The studios say their international sales have been posting double-digit increases , although they will not release totals . Lorimar , the largest seller of American programs abroad , said its international business has been growing by 25 percent annually for the last several years. // The gains could not come at a better time for Hollywood. // Producing television shows was for years a simple business . Hollywood ' s creative types would come up with an idea and pitch it to a network . If the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a producer a fee to make the show . The fee , which gave the network the right to broadcast the show twice , would cover the cost of production . The studio , which retained ownership of the show , would then make a profit , often a big one , by selling the rerun rights to local stations. // Today the production business is more complicated and risky. // The networks , under pressure to cut costs , have held the line on the license fees they pay the studios at a time when production expenses have continued to increase . As a result , virtually every one-hour show costs at least $200 , 000 an episode more to make than a network pays , and some expensive action-adventure series , such as " Miami Vice , " are believed to run deficits in the range of $500 , 000 an episode . Deficits for half-hour comedies are less . The networks generally pay a license fee of $800 , 000 to $1 million for each hour-long episode. // The studios gamble on being able to cover those deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tough at many local stations , making the domestic syndication market soft . And because fewer and fewer shows last on the networks for the three or four years needed to stockpile enough episodes to use as reruns , fewer shows even enter the syndication arena . <> <> Important to Budget // Many studios are now looking to international sales to fill the gap . " Three or four years ago , any money that came in from international , we ' d say , ' Oh , that ' s nice , ' " said William Saunders , an executive vice president at the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation . " Now it ' s a very important part of the budget process. " // Other studios are taking an even harder line . " We do not want to do a show unless the license fee from the network and the international revenues cover the cost of production , " said Colin P. Davis , the president of international television operations at MCA Inc. , the parent of Universal Studios. // Universal has stuck to its strategy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to produce " Crime Story " for NBC last year because it did not believe it could cover the deficits . A similar decision was made by 20th Century on " Rags to Riches " for NBC . Both shows were eventually made by the New World Entertainment Corporation , which said it was betting that it could do a better job of selling the shows abroad than MCA or Fox would have done. // So far , no programs are being developed just because they might have an international appeal . " American production is still going to produce what the American networks want and discount what international wants , " said Bruce Gordon , the president of international television for Paramount , a division of Gulf and Western Inc. // Still , the issue of international appeal is beginning to affect Hollywood ' s creative decisions . Some industry executives believe that Aaron Spelling Productions chose a cast for " The Colby ' s " with a strong international following , including actress Stephanie Beecham , to give the show a built-in following abroad . <> <> Least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is most economically appealing for them is often not what European viewers want to see . The greatest demand abroad is for hour-long action adventure series and dramas . But those are precisely the shows that run the biggest deficits and generate the least demand in domestic syndication. // Half-hour comedies , on the other hand , have much smaller deficits and can still generate huge sums in syndication . But most do not play well abroad . " Most American comedy is a play on words , and the minute you dub it into another language , you lose the joke , " said Mr. Gordon of Paramount . There are some exceptions , including " Alf , " Lorimar ' s situation comedy about an alien living with an American family. // Industry executives predict that there will be a growing number of co-production ventures between American and European producers , especially on mini-series and television movies . But even regular series will soon be made in Europe by partnerships of American studios and European broadcasters. //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
