Seeds of hope for Andropov <P> Since he replaced Leonid Brezhnev last November , Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov has , whether by choice or political necessity , maintained a low domestic profile . Now , however , the name of the stooped and often visibly tired former KGB chief is beginning to sprout more frequently on the front pages of Soviet newspapers . Moreover , in a long Pravda article published last week , Defense Minister Marshal Dmitri Ustinov for the first time referred to Andropov as Chairman of the Defense Council . The new title meant that Andropov now holds a post equivalent to commander in chief , thereby occupying two of the three top positions once held by Brezhnev . ( The office of President remains unfilled . ) Some Kremlinologists infer that Andropov has been consolidating his powers over rivals like Konstantin Chernenko , a onetime Brezhnev protege , who has not been seen in public since March 30 . <P> Andropov 's prospects may be further strengthened thanks to last week 's prediction by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the Soviet grain harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last four Soviet harvests have been unnaturally scanty , so much so that the Soviet government refused to announce production figures for the past two seasons . But this year the U.S.D.A. forecasts a total Soviet grain production of around 200 million metric tons . That figure falls far short of 1978 's record 237.4 million tons and of this year 's optimistic target of 238 million tons . But , after two consecutive years of 160 or 180 million tons annually , the projected upswing heralds a notable improvement . <P> The Soviets may reap additional solace from the likelihood that the increase is caused not only by an unusually mild winter and early spring , but also by the conversion of recalcitrant farmers . They seem to be at last responding to the initiatives outlined in Brezhnev 's controversial " Food Program , " under which farmers throughout the Soviet Union have begun to form " contract brigades " that reward members with cash or produce whenever crops exceed a predetermined goal . Says a U.S. expert : " By the inefficient standards of Soviet agriculture , the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if to underscore Andropov 's authority , the Soviet news agency TASS announced last week that Nobel Peace Prizewinning Physicist Andrei Sakharov , exiled to the city of Gorki since 1980 , would not be allowed to accept an invitation from Vienna University to teach there for a year . The ostensible reason : Sakharov , who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s , knows too many state secrets .
