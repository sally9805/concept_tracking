For nearly ten years , the Stealth bomber has been a secret in name only . Despite a hidden budget and a classification higher than top secret , military analysts and aviation buffs have pieced together a remarkably detailed picture of the first nuclear bomber designed to be almost invisible to enemy radar . Last week the Air Force acknowledged the plane 's flying-wing shape for the first time . The Pentagon issued a drawing of the so-called B-2 and announced that the bomber will make its maiden flight sometime this fall in a 30-mile run between Palmdale and Edwards Air Force Base in California . <P> The B-2 's boomerang shape eliminates the thick fuselage and vertical tail section that reflect radar in conventional planes . Flaps , rudders , elevators and ailerons appear to have been replaced by computer controlled nozzles that guide the aircraft by directing the flow of the engine 's exhaust . The engines themselves are nestled above the wings , shielding them from heat-seeking detectors on the ground . The outer skin and inner framework are cast in radar- absorbing carbon-epoxy composites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigeration system to cool and dissipate telltale exhaust fumes . <P> Experts point out that the Air Force drawing may be somewhat misleading . Several details , like the placement of the engine-exhaust outlets , have been deliberately masked . Others , including crew size and maximum payload , along with such flight characteristics as range , airspeed and cruising altitude , remain strictly classified . The Air Force does acknowledge , however , that the plane is going to cost more than projected . The fleet of 132 bombers , originally priced at $36.6 billion , could cost twice as much by the time it is airborne in the 1990s.
