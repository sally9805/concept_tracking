CHINA MEN by Maxine Hong Kingston ; Knopf ; 308 pages ; $10.95 <P> With The Woman Warrior ( 1976 ) , Author Maxine Hong Kingston left herself a hard act to follow . That book , her first , indelibly rendered the pain of growing up female and Chinese in the U.S. , of being in effect a servant among the dispossessed . It bridged two vastly different cultures ; its drawing of Chinese legends and customs was thorough and fascinating , while its evocation of the uncertainties of assimilation was quintessentially American . The Woman Warrior did , in short , what all great autobiographies do : it turned self-knowledge into art . <P> That remarkable journey inward now has a fitting companion . Kingston 's new book is a voyage out , an attempt to understand others by inhabiting them . The others are men , China Men , heirs to an ancient tradition of oppressing women . A scene early in the book sets Kingston off on her imaginative quest . As a young girl , the author watches her father at work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar in China , he is subject to black moods and bitterness over his low estate . His angriest curses vilify women 's bodies . The girl both understands and is bewildered . She addresses him in memory : " We knew that it was to feed us you had to endure demons and physical labor . " But she adds : " What I want from you is for you to tell me that those curses are only common Chinese sayings . That you did not mean to make me sicken at being female . " <P> The scene shifts abruptly back to another tune and country . Her father is born , the youngest of four boys . Her grandfather , considered addled by the villagers , tries to exchange his infant son for a girl baby . On feet maimed by binding , the mother hobbles off to retrieve her child , raging all the while at her husband : " Dead man , trading a son for a slave . Idiot . " It is this indomitable woman who had forced him to leave the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gold Mountain : " Make money . Do n't stay here eating . " <P> A pattern emerges through the book 's jumbled chronology . China Men go out in the world either to earn the right to come home to their women or to establish a new place suitable for them . One of Kingston 's grandfathers fetches up in the 1860s in the Sierra Nevada , seeking work with the Central Pacific Railroad . He is hired on the spot , Kingston notes acidly , because " chinamen had a natural talent for explosions . " Years of backbreaking , dangerous work follow , the continent is finally linked by rail , and then the grandfather and his fellow Chinese find they are no longer welcome on the Gold Mountain . <P> A great-grandfather goes to Hawaii at about the same time to clear the land and plant sugar cane . He resents the rule that forbids talking on the job : " How was he to marvel adequately , voiceless ? He needed to cast his voice out to catch ideas . " Lonely , overworked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large hole in a rich Hawaiian cane field , kneel around it and chant . " ' I want my home , ' the men yelled together . ' I want home . Home . Home . Home . Home . ' " Then they cover up the soil , trusting that the cane , when grown , will seed the air with their lament .
