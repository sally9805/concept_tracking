The play takes place in the overgrown garden of a country preacher 's house . There are stone animals , including one large goose , stone benches , a crumbling stone wall and a small pond . Various objects are imbedded in the wall  --  toys , mainly , but also such household objects as cups and saucers . It is not important that these objects be seen by the audience . In fact , the less impressive this garden appears , the better . It is Sam 's connection to the garden that is important , not ours . Sam comes out the back door onto the porch , then walks down the steps and into the garden . He smiles and nods , happy to see it again . As he walks through the leaves , he kicks a hidden toy , bends over , picks it up , and recognizes it as an old toy car of his . He brushes the leaves out of it , then races it up his arm . Then he puts the car back in the wall and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a geode . He picks it up , looks at the upstairs window of the house , then puts the geode back where it was . Now , Sam sees that a section of the wall is completely gone , and with it , apparently , the stone goose . He begins to lift the rock back into place . Glory opens the back door and calls out . GLORY Sam ? SAM I 'm out here . Come . Look . GLORY Do n't tell me now . Let me guess . ( She looks around . ) It 's the backyard . p. 3 SAM It 's Mother 's garden . GLORY I 'm sorry . ( She walks into the garden . ) SAM There are all kinds of stone animals , rabbits and things down there , somewhere , and watch where you step . One of those piles of leaves is a pond . ( Now he sees the stone goose buried under a pile of rock . ) Wait a minute ( He lifts the goose up and puts her in her rightful place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLORY ( Shakes her head . ) Sam SAM This place is a mess . Dad never did like this garden . He said Mother should save her knees for church . GLORY Sam , I 'm worried about Stephen . He does n't understand . SAM ( Going to the old tool chest near the porch . ) What 's there to understand ? Mavis is dead . GLORY Sam , she was more than your head nurse . Mavis carried a puzzle for Stephen in every purse she owned . She was his friend . He does n't believe it . SAM ( As he sweeps the top of the wall with a whisk broom . ) He will . He 'll be fine . Nobody ever died on him before , that 's all . He 'll get the hang of it , you 'll see . p. 4 GLORY He 's upstairs right now going through all your old books . SAM That 's all right , too . They ca n't hurt him now . Here , hold this a minute . ( He hands her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall where it belongs . ) GLORY Stephen needs you to explain this to him , Sam . I try to get him to talk about it , but he wo n't . You 've got to tell him something that will make him feel better . SAM Like what ? GLORY If I knew like what , I 'd tell him myself . SAM What did you say to make you feel better ? GLORY I do n't feel better . SAM See what I mean ? GLORY ( Irritated with him . ) But I want to feel better , and so does Stephen . SAM There is n't anything to say . Mavis waited too long to have herself checked . I did the operation . She died . Stephen knows all of that already . GLORY But he does n't know what it means . SAM It does n't mean anything . It 's justbad luck . ( He takes the stone rabbit from her and replaces it in the wall. ) p. 5 SAM There . Does n't that look better ? GLORY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had another funeral to preach this morning . He 'll be here as soon as he can . SAM There 's no reason for him to come home . We can just meet him at the church . GLORY He wants to see you , Sam , and the funeral 's not ' til two o'clock . ( Sam resumes his work on the wall . ) SAM Is everybody coming back here or what after the funeral ? I know Mavis did n't have any family left here . GLORY We 're all going to Josie Barnett 's . SAM Josie Barnett is a joke . GLORY Mavis loved her . SAM Mavis loved Dad . GLORY You do n't want them all coming here , do you ? SAM God , no . GLORY Well , then SAM Is Josie Barnettgoing totry tosingat the funeral ? ( She does n't answer , so he knows the answer must be yes . ) SAM Christ . p. 6 GLORY Sam . SAM It 's just an awful lot to pay for a free meal . ( Still she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a restaurant ? GLORY I do n't believe you . Ca n't you let up on these people for one day ? One day ? Mavis was one of these people , you know , and your dad is one of these people , and I am one of these people . ( She pauses . ) And so are you . SAM Okay , okay . STEPHEN ( Calling from inside the house . ) Dad ? SAM Out here , Stephen . GLORY ( To Sam . ) Will you try ? Will you try to get him to talk about it ? SAM If he wants to talk , I 'll listen . ( Pause . ) If that 's what you mean . GLORY You know what I mean . ( By now , Stephen is walking up to them , carrying a stack of old nursery rhymes and fairy tales . ) STEPHEN What a great house ! Why did n't we ever come here before ? SAM It 's just easier for Grandpa to visit us , Stephen . p. 7 STEPHEN This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall ? SAM No , Stephen , Mother did . ( Smiling at Glory . ) It was her way of teaching me not to leave my toys outside . STEPHEN I found a whole room of books , Dad , way at the top of the house . Like a forest of books growing up out of the floor . Just books and a rocking chair . I 've never seen a room like that . SAM Those were Mother 's books , Stephen . STEPHEN The ones I saw were all kids ' books . ( Pause . ) But where did you sit ? Is it your rocking chair or hers ? SAM Hers . STEPHEN They 're strange books , Dad . I did n't see a single one I 'd ever seen before . SAM I know . Your books make sense . GLORY I 'm sure Grandpa would let you take some of them home if you wanted to . SAM Stephen 's way too old for those books , are n't you ? GLORY This is a beautiful Mother Goose . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading this to you . ( And she reads . ) Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.All the King 's horses and all the King 's men , Could n't put Humpty together again . p. 8 STEPHEN I do n't get it . SAM ( Laughs . ) Good boy . GLORY ( Carefully . ) Stephen , it just means , there are some things that once they happen they ca n't be fixed . STEPHEN But how did he get on the wall in the first place ? Eggs ca n't climb . SAM ( Breaking the bad news . ) His mother . laid him there . GLORY Sam . STEPHEN Then how did he fall ? Eggs ca n't walk either . SAM She told him he was a man . See ? She dressed him up in a little man 's suit . He did n't know he could fall . He did n't know he could break . He did n't know he was an egg . STEPHEN So what happened to him ? Did he run all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry up in the sun or what ? ( Sam tests a big stone and finds it loose . ) SAM Something like that . GLORY ( Not pleased with Sam 's answer . ) I 'm sure somebody cleaned it up , Stephen . STEPHEN But who ? p. 9 GLORY Who do you think ? ( Pause . ) Mom . SAM No . I think Mom fell off the wall the day before . ( Glory is irritated with Sam , but she does her best not to show it . Sam puts the big stone where it belongs , as Glory turns her attention to Stephen . ) GLORY Now Stephen , the funeral is at two o'clock . But Grandpa 's coming home-first , and then we 'll all go to the church together . He was sorry he could n't be here to meet us when we got here , but he had another funeral to preach this morning . STEPHEN Okay . GLORY We 'll have to be very careful what we say to Grandpa . Mavis called him every Friday night , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital all week . He loved Mavis more than any of us did , I think . ( Pause . ) I knowhe was disappointed when your dad fell in love with me instead of Mavis . There 's nothing he likes better in this world than Mavis and your dad . STEPHEN Liked . GLORY What ? STEPHEN Liked better . Nothing he liked better than Mavis and Dad . GLORY You do n't stop liking people just because they die , Stephen . p. 10 SAM Sometimes you like them better . Harry Truman , for example . ( Glory picks up another book and starts to look through it . ) STEPHEN Can we go fishing while we 're here ? Mavis told me that 's what you do in the country . You fish till you 're hungry , eat till you 're sleepy , then sleep till it 's time to wake up and go fishing . GLORY I do n't know why not . SAM We 're not going to be here that long , Stephen . GLORY Do you want us to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN Am I going to sit by myself ? GLORY No , you 'll sit with us . STEPHEN Then no . If I need to stand up or anything , you can just grab me . ( Sam gives Glory a " let-him-alone " look , and Glory returns his look , as if to say " this is what I was talking about . " ) SAM Stephen , is there anything you want to ask me about any of this ? STEPHEN Do I have to say anything at the funeral ? SAM No . And you do n't have to listen , either . ( Glory does n't think this is helping Stephen a bit . She tries to interest him in the book she has. ) p. 11 GLORY Now here 's one I like , " The Princess and The Frog . " See , Stephen ? The princess kisses the frog and he turns into a prince . ( Sam makes some move that indicates he has understood her irritation . ) STEPHEN You 've got the frog colored in , Dad , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color frogs are , Stephen . STEPHEN Now how could a frog turn into a prince ? GLORY It was magic , Stephen . Magic always works . SAM ( A direct communication to Glory . ) Magic had nothing to do with it . The frog believed that the beauty could turn him into a prince . One kiss from her and he would be handsome , and play tennis , and mix martinis , and tell jokes at parties , just like all her other boyfriends . ( Pause . ) But years later , the prince started to turn , slowly at first , but finally and irreversibly , back into the frog he always was . STEPHEN It does n't say that in this book . SAM ( Scraping the dirt off some of the toys that have fallen out of the wall . ) It does n't have to . You are born a frog and that is it . It 's not so bad , but it is it . Frogs should know better , but they don't. p. 12 STEPHEN Then they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't magic , Stephen . It 's just smart . GLORY That is not how the story ends . SAM ( Quite intense . ) It is how the story ends . The princess got old and the frog croaked . ( As Glory stares at him . ) SAM Get another book , Stephen . STEPHEN ( Getting what he thinks Sam means. ) - Go away , Stephen . SAM No . Come back . But no more fairy tales . There are some good books up there . Call of the Wild : Lord of the Flies . Read about Donner Pass . ( Stephen jumps down off the wall and goes into the house . There is a moment of silence . ) GLORY ( After Stephen has gone . ) Is that your idea of help ? SAM What ? GLORY You , the frog , married me , the princess , and Humpty Dumpty was a hit-and-run . SAM He 's old enough to know what happens . GLORY Nobody 's old enough to know what you think happens . p. 13 SAM I refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time hoping it will all work out . GLORY He could live a long time having it all work out , unless you convince him it 's impossible and he does n't even try . SAM What do you want me to say ? GLORY Life is good . SAM When ? GLORY All the time ! SAM Like today , for example . GLORY No , not like today . People do n't die every day . SAM Oh Glory , I 'm afraid they do . GLORY Not people you know . SAM Oh , I see . It does n't count if we do n't know them . GLORY It does n't hurt if we do n't know them . SAM It does n't matter , you mean . GLORY No , I do n't mean that . SAM What do you mean ? GLORY You tell him the wrong things SAM I tell him the truth . GLORY And he believes you ! p. 14 SAM Well , I ca n't help that . GLORY He 's a child ! SAM I want a divorce . GLORY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a moment . ) I do want a divorce . I want to leave here in the morning and take Stephen with me . GLORY You can go for the weekend , Sam , but Stephen has school on Monday . SAM Since we 're having one funeral anyway , we might as well have the other one and be done with it . When we all wake up , this will all be over . GLORY What is the matter with you ? ( Stephen opens the porch door , but they do n't hear him . He starts to come down the steps , but then realizes what this conversation is about . He goes back up the steps , climbs quietly over the railing and sits , out of sight , behind a tree . ) SAM I just never stopped to think about it , I guess . It does n't make sense , this marriage . It never has . Ask your mother . GLORY It works well enough , Sam . It calms you down , and it keeps me from getting too comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things SAM We do n't ever agree on things . p. 15 GLORY But it 's good for Stephen to hear both sides . SAM No . It confuses him . I 'll tell Dad tonight , and in the morning I 'll go over and tell your mother and then I 'll get Stephen and go . I 'll send you as much money as you need and you can have everything we own . All the houses , all the cars , everything . GLORY That 's ridiculous . SAM Okay . I 'll keep the cars . ( There is a long silence . ) GLORY ( Finally . ) You 're serious ! SAM Always have been . ( Then overly cheerful . ) I thought you knew that . GLORY You 're upset . SAM True . GLORY I mean you 're upset about Mavis . You do n't think you can work without Mavis . Well , leaving me is n't going to bring Mavis back to you . SAM Mavis has nothing to do with this . GLORY Nice work , doctor . Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . You do n't even need your fancy table or your hotshot team for this sugery , do you ? You 're so good , you can do it in the backyard SAM Wherever . p. 16 GLORY Look . Let 's just get through the funeral , okay ? And then if you still feel this way we 'll talk about it when we get home . SAM I do n't wa n't to talk about it . I want to quit . I want to go somewhere else . I want to start over . GLORY Life does n't start over . It starts , it goes on for a while , then it stops . SAM God that 's gloomy . GLORY I sound like you ! SAM No you do n't . I would never say that . Mavis did n't have to die . There was a time she could have done something about it . This is that time for Stephen and me . GLORY You ca n't leave me . SAM You 'll be okay . Move back here if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLORY Of course I 'll be okay . I 'm talking about you . Do you have any idea what it takes to live your life ? SAM I can probably figure it out . GLORY I know you ca n't take care of Stephen . SAM Stephen is old enough to take care of himself . GLORY Stephen would end up taking care of you . And you 're important , so somebody should do all the things that allow you to work , but it should n't be Stephen . p. 17 SAM We 'll share it . I 'll help him . He 'll help me . GLORY I think we better wait till we get home to talk about this . SAM I think we 're talking about it already . GLORY The answer is no . SAM Yes , well , it was n't really a question , Glory . GLORY I 'm going inside . SAM I 'm not . GLORY Fine . SAM ( Staring at the goose . ) There once was a woman called Nothing-At-All Who rejoiced in a dwelling exceedingly small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And down in a gulp both house and woman went . ( Stephen appears from behind the tree . He is holding a framed photo and another fairy-tale book . ) STEPHEN ( Pointing to the photo . ) Is this you , Dad ? SAM ( Startled by his presence . ) Stephen ! STEPHEN Is this you in this picture ? SAM ( Staring at the photo . ) Yes . STEPHEN Who is this with you ? p. 18 SAM That 's Motherand that'sMavis . STEPHEN And it 's Halloween I hope . SAM Yes . STEPHEN What were you ? I ca n't tell . SAM Elves . STEPHEN Did Mavis tell you I lost her cat ? SAM I gave her that cat . STEPHEN I know . I 'm sorry , Dad . SAM When was this ? STEPHEN Last Saturday . After the movies we went back to her apartment , and I asked Mavis if I could let Peaches out , only Mavis did n't hear me because she went in the bedroom to rest a little bit . But Peaches kept crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and she got away . When Mavis woke up , we looked and looked , but we could n't find her anywhere . ( Pause . ) I guess Mavis did n't tell you because she did n't want you to be mad at me . SAM It 's all right , Stephen . Cats justgo like that . STEPHEN Maybe Peaches knew something was wrong . SAM Maybe she did . ( Pause . ) Stephen , your mother and I were just talking  --  p. 19 STEPHEN ( Quietly . ) I guess your birthday 's going to be pretty lonely this year . SAM ( Pause . ) Yes . I guess it will be . STEPHEN I would n't like it if I had the same birthday as somebody . I mean , I know there are plenty of people born on the same day as me , but  --  SAM People used to ask Mavis where she met me , you know , and she 'd say , " Oh , at the hospital . In the nursery . " And then she 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in came Sam Carter screaming at me already . " ( Pause . ) That 's a picture I 'd like to see , all right . Dad and Mavis 's dad staring through the glass window looking at the two of us side by side in our little beds . One howling boy for the preacher , and one rosy-faced dumpling for the custodian at the church . STEPHEN Mavis was n't fat , Dad . SAM No . But I did have the idea that she put on her uniform in the morning , and then stepped on an air pump to puff herself up for the day . STEPHEN I 'm not going to like Saturday much either . SAM She loved you so much , Stephen . You were the only little boy she had . You were so good to her , you gave her so much . p. 20 STEPHEN All we ever talked about was you , Dad . SAM Yeah , well , she just loved to talk , Stephen . And I did n't leave her time to learn anything else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would die , Stephen . It just did n't seem like something she 'd do . I 'm sorry I did n't warn you , I should have known it , my mother died , did n't she ? I guess I just forgot . STEPHEN Yeah . SAM Well STEPHEN Why do people read these books ? SAM What ? STEPHEN I know you told me not to read any more , but I was taking it back upstairs and I did n't get this one either . SAM Which one ? STEPHEN I think Sleeping Beauty 's father was a fool . SAM All right . But do n't just say he was a fool . Prove it to me . Build your case . STEPHEN He gives a party for his daughter and he invites twelve of the thirteen fairies in the land . Twelve good fairies he invites . He does not invite the thirteenth fairy . SAM Because she 's a bad fairy , that 's right . STEPHEN But the bad fairy comes anyway , and now she acts even worse because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little princess , " she says . " When she is eighteen , she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die . " p. 21 SAM That 's how it goes , all right . STEPHEN It 's ridiculous . If you know you have a thirteenth fairy living in your country , and you know what she can do , then how , exactly , can you forget to invite her to a party ? SAM Well STEPHEN How did anybody that dumb get to be king ? SAM He was n't dumb . He just forgot . STEPHEN He forgets there 's a bad fairy living there and look what happens . Everybody sleeps for a hundred years , till he wakes up with his kingdom turned into a jungle and some prince upstairs kissing his daughter . SAM ( Strangely affected by this story . ) He forgot because he did n't want to remember ! He did n't want her to come to the party ! The last person you want at that party is that thirteenth fairy . So you just hope she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up , there is n't a damn thing you can do about it . STEPHEN ( Reacting to his fathers anger . ) It 's just a story , Dad . SAM Yeah , I know . That 's why I never let you read them . STEPHEN But you read them . p. 22 SAM ( Disclaiming all responsibility . ) Mother read them to me . ( Almost a confession . ) And then , when I learned how , yes , I would read them to her . ( Pause . ) Every day when I came home from school , here she 'd be , with a glass of milk for me and a pile of things she 'd found in the ground that day , like dragons ' teeth , witches ' fingers , and fallen stars . ( Then remembering so clearly . ) I would sit , there , where you are , and she would work . And we would sing . Her favorite Mother Goose was page twenty . ( He sings as Stephen is looking for it . ) SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kittens have gone to St. Paul's.The babies are bit , The moon 's in a fitAnd the houses are built without walls . STEPHEN The houses are built without walls ? SAM Yes . STEPHEN How could they stand up ? SAM ( Suddenly very distant . ) She died before I could ask her that , Stephen . STEPHEN What was she like ? SAM She was the gingerbread lady . Curly red hair and shiny round eyes and a big checked apron . Fat , pink fingers , a sweet vanilla smell , and all the time in the world . Sing to you , dance with you , write your name on the top of a cake . p. 23 STEPHEN Did she die all of a sudden like Mavis ? SAM Mother was sick for a long time , Stephen , but sick or not , everybody dies all of a sudden . STEPHEN I guess that was pretty hard , too , huh ? SAM It was awful . I took it , well , like it happened to me instead of to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , well , if she had n't died , I 'd be the biggest momma 's boy you ever saw . ( Everett enters from the side of the house . He walks with some difficulty , but he 's keeping his spirits up with an extraordinary act of will . ) EVERETT Samuel ! SAM Hello , Dad . ( They embrace , but it is difficult for them . ) SAM ( A bit awkward . ) I 'm sorry I could n't save her . EVERETT ( Pulling away . ) You did your best , did n't you ? SAM Yes . EVERETT Well , that 's all anybody expects , Sam . ( Shifting his attention to Stephen . ) Hello , Stephen . Remember me ? STEPHEN It 's only been a year , Grandpa . ( Stephen gives him a small hug. ) p. 24 EVERETT Where 's your mother ? STEPHEN Inside . Want me to go get her ? EVERETT I 'm glad she 's here . SAM You knew she would come , Dad . ( He helps Everett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm fine . Are you all right ? SAM I 'm fine . EVERETT You look tired , Sam . SAM I 'm not tired , Dad . I 'm just grown up . EVERETT I miss seeing you , son . SAM I 'm sorry , Dad . They keep me pretty busy these days . EVERETT Oh I know . Mavis told me . ( His fatherly pride showing . ) She said you could do things nobody else even thought of . She said there were dead people standing in line at the water fountain because of you . She sent me all the clippings . I liked that one about the governor . That was a good picture of you . ( No response from Sam . ) EVERETT Oh how she loved you , son . " Well , " she 'd say , " we had another miracle today . " ( Another long silence . ) SAM How was your other funeral ? Who was it ? p. 25 EVERETT ( Glad to have something else to talk about . ) Connie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she first got sick , but she would n't hear of it . She said you were too famous . You were too far away . ( Sam does not answer . ) EVERETT She felt the same way about God . But I guess she figured she did n't have to get on the bus to go see Him . ( Everett reaches down to pat Sam , but he moves away , and Everett goes over to pat Stephen . He just needs to pat somebody , and Stephen is too polite to resist . ) STEPHEN Where did you tell them she went , at the funeral ? SAM Stephen , Grandpa 's sermons are his business . He says what he has to say . EVERETT I told them she went to heaven . STEPHEN Why did you have to say that ? EVERETT ( Ignoring Sam 's silencing look . ) Because that 's where she went . STEPHEN ( Does n't believe this for a minute . ) And that 's where she is right now , singing and flying around ? It sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heard enough of her singing already . He 'll have her light the candles or something . p. 26 STEPHEN ( A conspiratorial look at Sam . ) They have candles in heaven ? Is n't it too windy for candles ? EVERETT If God wants a candle to stay lit , it stays lit . What they do n't have in heaven is matches . But then , angels do n't need matches . They just put their pointer finger up to it , like so , and poof , it 's lit . STEPHEN ( Much simpler , actually childlike . ) How do they do that ? EVERETT ( Sounding more like the wizard he is . ) It 's because they 're pure spirit now , Stephen . The life in them is like sparks , like fireworks . Oh , they could really light up the sky if they felt like it , but they do n't want to show off , you know . They do n't want people dying down here just to get in on the fun . But now , shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's somebody new up there . Somebody has n't quite figured out how to control themselves . ( Suddenly flinging his arms out wide . ) Pow ! STEPHEN Great ! SAM ( Quietly , but firmly . ) Stephen , go find your mother . Tell her Grandpa 's here . ( Stephen leaves. ) p. 27 SAM ( After a moment . ) That 's enough , Dad . EVERETT Do n't be mad at me , boy . I ca n't help talking about angels . I just know so many of them , now . SAM ( Being careful not to get angry . ) I do n't want you telling Stephen there 's a heaven and a hell , because if you do , I 'll have to tell him who it is who assigns the rooms . EVERETT You do want him on the right waiting list , do n't you ? SAM I do n't want him thinking about it at all . ( Then more calm . ) Let 's just say , if there is a hell , if Stephen does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a surprise . EVERETT No grandson of mine is going to hell . SAM No grandson of anybody 's is going to hell . There is no hell . There is no heaven . Life is summer camp and death is lights out . It 's all just over , Dad . Time 's up . The end . You lose . EVERETT Is that what you tell their families at the hospital ? SAM What is there to say ? EVERETT There 's comfort . SAM There 's all your friends waiting for you ? There 's your Heavenly Father with His arms open wide ? No , no . I 've been straight with them all along , so I 'm not about to get to the end and lie . I do what I can and then we both just quit . p. 28 EVERETT Mavis would never quit . SAM Mavis quit before I did . I briefed the team , I opened her up , but what did I find ? Her bags were packed . She was checking out . She was going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of God 's hands as long as possible , so you just keep your sermons to yourself . EVERETT ( Carefully . ) Was Mavis in any pain SAM No . EVERETT Did sheknow it was happening ? SAM No . EVERETT So she could n't give you anymessage for me . SAM No . ( Then trying to concentrate on something else . ) But she just bought a new car . I know she 'd want you to have it . It has power steering and everything . We drove it down here for you . That 's it ( Motioning in that direction. ) out in the driveway . EVERETT I appreciate the thought , son , but I do n't think I could ( Pause . ) No . You were right to bring it . SAM Glory packed up all her clothes and put them in the trunk . We thought there might be people around here who could use them . Everything else , furniture and everything , was rented . Except her TV , and I took that in for the nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . p. 29 EVERETT That part 's done , anyway . ( He notices the picture Stephen brought out before . ) Anything I have  --  of hers , you know  --  you can have it if you want it . I 'd like to keep her letters , but after I die , they 'll be yours too , of course , like everything else I have . Do you want this picture ? SAM Stephen found it . EVERETT I always liked this one . ( Hoping Sam will say no . ) You do n't want it , do you ? SAM No . EVERETT Yes , I guess you have plenty of pictures of the two of you . They 're probably all up and down the halls at the hospital . SAM Can we talk about something else ? EVERETT I 'm sorry , son . Just all those years of her hanging around you , I think of her as part of the family . Probably thought she 'd be part of the family someday . SAM She loved you , Dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . If it had n't been for you , she 'd be right here , working at County General . SAM She was too good for your little hospital . EVERETT But not good enough for you . p. 30 SAM We do n't have to have this argument anymore , Dad . Mavis is not yours and she 's not mine . She 's dead . ( Stephen enters with a book of illustrated Bible stories . ) STEPHEN Hey , I like this one about the whale . What does it mean ? This guy , Jonah , gets swallowed by a whale and then the whale throws him up . EVERETT It means you ca n't run away from God , Stephen . SAM ( Annoyed that Everett is talking religion again . ) No , Stephen , it means you should n't go to sea in too small a boat . ( Glory comes out , wearing an apron and drying her hands on a dish towel . ) GLORY Hello , Everett . ( They embrace . ) EVERETT Glory Butler , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing all right , Everett ? EVERETT Yes I am , thank you . GLORY ( Remembering how distant this man can be . ) I hope you do n't have this too often , two funerals in one day . EVERETT ( Making an effort to talk to her . ) Your mother was at the one this morning . p. 31 GLORY How 'd she look ? EVERETT Rich . GLORY She does like to show it off , does n't she ? EVERETT All she could talk about were her two new fillies  --  both jumpers , she said . And she 's got a new exercise boy . He was there with her today . GLORY ( A knowing smile . ) Was he all dressed up , or was he just driving the car ? EVERETT ( Confirming her worst fears . ) All dressed up . GLORY She 's so funny . When Daddy died , she walked me up to the casket , held my hand and said , " Glory , I 'm never going to be lonely again . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her you were coming down for Mavis 's funeral , but she said she would n't bother you here . ( A pause . ) Our house always was a little plain for her . GLORY I made us some sandwiches . They 're on the counter if you want one . EVERETT I should eat something I guess . Do n't you want one , Sam ? ( No response from Sam . ) GLORY We 'll be there in a minute . ( Pause . ) I straightened up your kitchen a little . I hope you do n't mind . p. 32 EVERETT No . Just so you put it back the way it was before you leave . GLORY Everett , I was just trying to help . I 'm sorry . EVERETT ( Walking toward Stephen . ) I know Stephen 's hungry , are n't you ? STEPHEN Grandpa ? EVERETT What , son ? STEPHEN If the people in heaven are all spirit , if they do n't have any flesh anymore , how does God know who 's who ? EVERETT ( Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . ) Spirit 's how God tells us apart anyway , Stephen . When we get to heaven , why as far as He 's concerned , we have n't changed a bit . ( Glory is left alone with Sam . Sam has a pair of snippers from the tool chest and is cutting the weeds that have grown up around the wall . ) GLORY I 'm beginning to see the garden now , Sam . SAM I do n't know why I 'm doing this . He 'll just let it go again . GLORY Did you and Mavis play out here when you were kids ? SAM ( Putting the snippers down . ) Maybe I 've done enough . p. 33 GLORY Where did your mother find these animals ? SAM I do n't know . GLORY ( As she picks one up . ) Was she strong enough to carry them ? They 're very heavy . SAM Please . ( Taking it away from her . ) Just leave them alone , okay ? GLORY He wo n't let me touch anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch anything out here . It 's just me , I guess , I mean , your mother was allowed to work here , was n't she ? Or maybe it 's a museum , or a shrine . SAM What 's the matter with you ? GLORY ( Has to laugh . ) What 's the matter with me . SAM Did you call your mother ? GLORY I did , in fact . I told her you were leaving in the morning and taking Stephen with you . SAM And what did she say ? GLORY She said she would see you at the funeral and tell you good-bye . SAM So we 'll have something to talk about anyway . GLORY She said it was another woman . She said you and Mavis were p. 34 SAM having an affair ? No . GLORY Someone else , then . Do you want to leave me for another woman ? SAM I do n't want another woman . I want you to be the woman I want . GLORY Can I have a straight answer please . SAM We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that 's it , I guess . SAM It what ? GLORY The truth . SAM That is not the truth . That is just a fact . The truth is what the facts mean . GLORY I am so tired of your mind . You would 've been so much better off without it . SAM I would have been nothing without it ! With the exception of a mother who died and left me with the preacher , my mind is all I ever had . ( He stops . ) Except Stephen . GLORY ( She shakes her head . ) And your mother and Mavis and me . SAM Yes . GLORY Did you forget us for a moment ? SAM No , I did n't forget you . But it is getting easier . There 's only one of you left . p. 35 GLORY What a lovely thing to say . What a great time we 're having here . Such a good reason to come home and such a spirit of love and understanding . Just relax , Glory . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always like this , but he 's not always so much like this . SAM I 'm not always like this . GLORY No . When you 're sick , it 's worse . When you 're tired , it 's worse . But the rest of the time you are exactly like this . You just do n't notice it , because this is how you always are . Like I said . SAM Then why have you stayed with me . GLORY I do n't know , it 's not over yet . Something like that . SAM It is over . GLORY ( Picking up the Sleeping Beauty book . ) No , this is just the part where I sleep for a hundred years . Then the prince comes and I wake up . SAM Jesus Christ . GLORY I 'm still here for two reasons . One is that you need me . And I have no idea why you need me but you do . I can feel it . I see it all the time . I do n't understand at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the other reason ? GLORY The other reason is my business . And I 'm not about to tell you when you 're threatening to leave me. p. 36 SAM Well , I know it ca n't be that you 're having a good time . You should 've married that baseball player . GLORY If I had married Jerry Pine , I would 've spent half my life at Yankee Stadium , wishing he would n't chew tobacco , and hoping he wo n't spit on national TV . ( A pause . ) Maybe I would have a better time without you . I could laugh and travel and give away Mother 's money , but youwell This is not a job that just anybody could do , you know , putting up with you . SAM So this is your chance . I 'm offering you a way out . GLORY I want a way in , Sam . SAM There is n't any way in . There never was . You never had a chance . I married you to spite my father . ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I leave now ? GLORY I know you loved me . SAM Do you ? GLORY I know you love me now . ( He turns to go . ) GLORY Where are you going ? SAM ( After a moment . ) I have to find Stephen before Dad turns him into a Christian . GLORY Let them alone . You ca n't change your father and you ca n't protect Stephen from the entire world . It 's one thing to take away the television and give him Scientific American instead of Mother Goose , but Everett is his grandfather . Let them talk . Stephen can see what there is and decide for himself . ( Before Sam can answer , Everett comes back outside alone. ) p. 37 EVERETT Maybe you two been gone so long you forgot this , but we have a thing out here called respect for the dead . GLORY What ? EVERETT And Glory , if you 're going to your mother 's , I wish you 'd go on and go so we could have our funeral in peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  EVERETT Do n't you realize what you 're doing to that little boy ? GLORY What did he tell you , Everett ? EVERETT That he 's leaving tomorrow with Sam and you 're moving in with your mother . Is that right ? GLORY He hears everything we say , Sam , I 've told you that over and over again . Jesus Christ . SAM Why should n't be know ? I 'm just sorry I did n't tell him before he heard it through the wall , like that . He was n't surprised , I 'm sure . Divorce is not exactly unknown in the world . Now that he knows the truth , he 'll feel better . GLORY ( To Everett . ) What did you say ? EVERETT I did n't know what to say . I said , " Maybe Mom is just lonesome for the country . She 'll get tired of it soon enough and be right back home , quick as quick . " ( Very strong , as Sam shakes his head. ) p. 38 EVERETT I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel better . SAM And he believed you ? EVERETT I saw him feel a little better , yes . GLORY Thank you , Everett . You did the right thing . SAM Cover it up , that 's right . Put a little Band-Aid on it . It worked with me , did n't it ? I have spent my life straightening out the lies people have told him . No , Stephen , there is no Santa Claus . No , Stephen , when you die , you do not go to heaven . No , Stephen , people wo n't like you better because you 're smart , they 'll be afraid of you because you 're smart . No , Stephen , love is not forever , and God is not good . And tomorrow is not another day . Tomorrow is this day all over again . EVERETT Well , was n't he lucky to have you around . GLORY I 'd better go find him . EVERETT I think that 's a good idea . ( Glory goes into the house and Everett and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear what you have to say about this , Dad . You do n't know what you 're talking about , and you 're not going to change my mind . EVERETT That 's as good a confession as I ever heard . p. 39 SAM You never liked Glory in the first place . You should be happy I 'm leaving her . EVERETT She 's a good girl , and she 's been a good mother to Stephen . Whatever is the matter between Glory and you is probably you . SAM I see . EVERETT But it 's your boy who 'll end up paying for this , Sam . SAM Does n't seem fair , does it ? Well , I 'm sorry , Stephen , that 's just how God is . Suffer the little children to come unto me , for theirs is the wages of sin . EVERETT When somebody dies it makes everything hard , Sam , but what we all do is try not to make anything worse . SAM When somebody dies , you try to make it make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never thought this marriage would work , you know that . But we 're having a funeral today . Ca n't you take one day of your life to think about Mavis ? God knows , you took everything else she had for your own use , but now you 're even taking her funeral . ( Pause . ) I 'm sure she 's happy for you to have it , that 's just how she was , but it makes me mad , Sam . You make too much noise , son . You always did . Relax . Grieve . SAM No . This marriage was never right , and I want it straight now . p. 40 EVERETT After the funeral , just leave Stephen with me for a few days , and you and Glory go down to Green River , work this thing out . SAM I do n't want to work it out . What could we work it out to ? Back to where it was at the beginning ? In the beginning was the word , and the word was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and there was n't any pretend about it . You were hopeless . You drooled around here for years until Glory called you with that math problem . Here was poor Mavis practically polishing your shoes to get your attention . But no , all you wanted was the pretty little rich girl , swimming in her own private lake out there . But how was she ever going to notice the preacher 's kid ? So you took up cross-country , did n't you ? And pretty soon , you could run the ten miles out to her farm , and still have the breath to stand there and smile . SAM Why do n't you say what you mean . Divorce is a sin . EVERETT Sam , your mother used to say your marriage was like your favorite shirt . You could wear it day after day , and you could try to keep it clean , but sooner or later it was going to have to go in the wash . But as soon as it was clean , you could press it fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SAM I do n't have a favorite shirt . And I do n't need advice from you . p. 41 EVERETT What does she say ? Does she say " Whatever you want , Sam " ? SAM She will . Glory will do what Stephen wants . Stephen wants to be with me . EVERETT Stephen will be ready to go home tomorrow morning . Glory may not have all the answers to his questions , like you do , but she 's home when he gets there . SAM That 's not enough . EVERETT If you leave her , you 'll lose him . SAM Stephen is mine . He always has been . EVERETT And you 're supposed to be so smart . ( No response . ) Maybe you ought to make a list of the things you do n't know , just for your own protection , see . ( A pause . ) Put this at the top . SAM Thiswhat ? EVERETT Boys and their mothers . SAM Whatever you say , Dad . EVERETT This isa subject I took a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the porch carrying a cup of coffee for Everett . ) GLORY Sam ? Do n't you want a sandwich ? We should leave in twenty minutes . p. 42 SAM No thanks . I do n't want to spoil my dinner . ( Stephen runs past her and down the steps . ) GLORY Do n't get dirty now , Stephen . Watch where you sit . ( Stephen is carrying a Bible he has found inside . Glory follows him into the garden . ) STEPHEN Dad , I found your Bible ! SAM ( Alarmed . ) Glory , where  --  STEPHEN ( Still very excited . ) I thought it was Grandpa 's , but it 's yours ! GLORY ( To Sam . ) In your old bedroom , I think . STEPHEN ( Showing it to him . ) See ? It says Samuel Carter . SAM The church gives them away , Stephen . STEPHEN No , look , Dad ! On the next page , it says  --  SAM ( To Everett . ) Did you give this to him ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its right here . It says August 27 , 1949 , Jesus came into my heart . SAM Well  --  p. 43 STEPHEN Only you 've got it spelled H-E-R-A-T . Jesus came into your heart before you could even spell it ! ( Glory hands the coffee to Everett . ) SAM I did n't have any choice , Stephen . Night after night you sit there in the revival and every head is bowed and every eye is closed , and Dad is down there at the altar calling " Oh sinner , come home . " And people all around you are saying " Bless me Jesus , save me Lord . " And the first night eight people go down and the second night twenty people go down , and the third night everybody in the whole third grade goes down , and those are the big kids , so I 'm impressed . And you look up at Dad and he 's looking straight at you , saying " God see my boy , see my own dear child , speak to him , Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go home if I didn't.So before I could stop myself , I walked down the aisle , shaking and crying , saying " Here I am , Daddy . " I knelt down at the altar , and he put his hand on my head and said " Praise the Lord , " and I was saved . And hewas relieved . What kind of a preacher are you if you ca n't save your own child ? EVERETT I did n't save you . He did . SAM Then after the service , we all waited for him in the front pew where he gave us all brand-new Bibles and had us turn to the front page and write down August 27 , 1949  --  p. 44 SAM AND STEPHEN  --  Jesus came into my heart . STEPHEN Did you read this ? EVERETT He read it straight through before school even started that year . SAM I was too young to read , Dad . I just looked at the pictures , Stephen . EVERETT He knew hundreds of verses by heart . I 'd be reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at him in the front row , and he 'd be mouthing the words right along with me . SAM Take it easy , Dad . EVERETT But I was so proud of you , son ! SAM I know , but  --  EVERETT Stephen , we had Junior Church one Sunday a month , you know , where only the kids would come , and your dad started preaching there when he was only nine years old . By the time he was twelve , people all over the state had heard about him . STEPHEN You never told me you were a preacher , Dad . EVERETT That summer , at the revival , I announced in the newspaper that your dad was going to preach the sermon one night , and so many people came that there was n't enough room for them all in the tent , so we had to open up the sides so people could sit on the grass and see him . He talked about Abraham that night . Abraham and Isaac . p. 45 STEPHEN ( Finding the picture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking toward Sam . ) But he 's killing his little boy . SAM That 's him all right . God says to Abraham , " If you really love me , you will sacrifice your son . You will build a fire , tie him to the top of it , slit his throat , say a prayer , and burn him up . " STEPHEN Why ? EVERETT The Lord was testing Abraham , Stephen . SAM The Lord was bored , Stephen . He was just looking for something to do . EVERETT Oh no . God had big plans for Abraham . And He had to make sure Abraham was the right man for the job . STEPHEN Is this God , here , in the clouds ? SAM There 's a much better picture of Him on page fifty-eight . That 's Him in the burning bush . STEPHEN And He is n't burned up ? EVERETT He is the fire . STEPHEN He is ? EVERETT God really knows how to get your attention , all right . SAM He 's lonely , Stephen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , when they do n't , or when they do n't notice Him enough , well , He plays His little tricks , He gives His little tests . p. 46 EVERETT He has His reasons for His tests . SAM That 's what you said when Mother died . God is testing us , son . God has His reasons , only we ca n't know what they are . EVERETT God did n't kill her . SAM He just let her die . He took her back . He was only kidding . She was n't mine . She was His . GLORY Stephen , why do n't you take the Bible inside . We do n't want it to get  --  SAM She died when I was about your age , Stephen . About a month after my preaching triumph . But we did n't call it dying , did we , Dad ? We just said God was missing her something awful and she went on back where she belonged , did n't we ? EVERETT Yes , we did . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as He did . STEPHEN I do n't understand . Could God have saved Granny if He wanted to ? EVERETT Yes , Stephen . STEPHEN Then why did n't He ? EVERETT We do not understand everything that happens , but if we believe He loves us , we do n't need to understand . Understanding is His work , not ours . SAM That 's right . He sets it up , we live through it , and He writes it down . What we think of as life , Stephen , is just God gathering material for another book . p. 47 STEPHEN Was God missing Mavis too ? SAM Stephen  --  EVERETT ( Quickly . ) I do n't know , Stephen . But I do know He has His mysterious ways of working things out . Your daddy is a doctor today because his mother died when he was so young . SAM Jesus Christ . EVERETT They worked puzzles on her bed right up to the day she died . I 'd come in to check on her , and she 'd be asleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she could hear every word . He worked real hard but he could n't save her . He was just a boy . SAM Jesus God . EVERETT But now , every time he goes into that operating room , God gives him another chance . How many people are alive today because of him ! Hundreds ! Thousands maybe . Praise be to the power and the wisdom of the Almighty God . SAM You are a hopeless old fool ! GLORY Sam , you apologize to your father ! SAM God is not in control . GLORY Please , Sam , remember what we 're doing here . SAM I will not have Stephen walk into that funeral believing God has some reason for this ! ( He turns to Stephen . ) He 's lying to you , Stephen . He lied to me and now he 's lying to you and I wo n't have it ! God had nothing to do with Mavis dying . It just happened . It was a goddamn rotten thing to happen , but God did n't do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in control for some time . ( He pauses and shifts into the master storyteller he can be . ) He lost itover Job . God made a bet with the Devil and lost it all . ( Glory shakes her head and wanders off a bit . Sam relaxes a little , now that he has won. ) p. 48 SAM The Devil said , " Sure Job loves you . Why should n't he ? He 's the richest man on earth . But you take all that away , and he wo n't pray to you then , no sir . " Well , God just had to find out . So in one afternoon , He killed all his sheep , all his camels , all his oxes and his asses and his daughters and his sons . And Job still prayed . So the next afternoon , God set a fire that burned up his house and everything in it , turned all his friends against him , sat Job down in the ashes and gave him leprosy.And even then , Job prayed . Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , in fact , as God had ever suffered . And when God realized that Job could suffer just as well as He could , everything changed . For God saw that He had sinned , but Job loved Him still . And in that moment , God found God , and it was man.And ever since that time , God has been up there believing in us with all His heart , believing we can do whatever we want , and wondering why , exactly , we do what we do . We must have our reasons , but He ca n't , for the life of Him , figure out what they are.So He watches , but He ca n't help us . So He weeps . All God can do now is cry . The oceans , Stephen , are the tears God has cried since Job . GLORY ( Coming back ) We need to go , Sam . SAM ( Continuing . ) God is not in control . We are . There is no heaven , there is no hell . There is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and me . Life on earth , which we can make better through careful thought and hard work . But we make the progress , and we make the mistakes . Not God . God has nothing to do with this , so there is no point in believing in Him . He 's just another fairy-tale king , as far as I 'm concerned . If you want to believe , believe in yourself . In your power , in your mind , in your life . This life . Because that 's all there is . ( Everett looks at his watch , then straightens his tie. ) p. 49 GLORY ( Coming quickly to be near Stephen . ) That 's all your father thinks there is , Stephen . But he really does n't know . Other people ( Her anger is making it hard for her to talk. ) find other things . Other people believe other things . And it makes them feeldifferent . Better . SAM Well , what can I say after that . EVERETT ( Standing up . ) Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM No thanks . EVERETT I 'll say it was an accident , how 's that ? I 'll say it was a stupid mistake that somebody made . And we wo n't pray , of course , but we will sing . Something like " Moon River , " you know , whatever we feel like . It does n't matter what we do , does it , Sam ? It does n't mean a thing . SAM I do n't know , Dad . It 's your show . EVERETT This is no show ! SAM It is a show and you know it . EVERETT Well I 'll tell you one thing , boy . My show works . SAM Oh , you think so , do you ? EVERETT Yes I do . My show works . It works so well that you  --  yes , even you  --  have come home to see it . Have n't you ? p. 50 SAM ( Brushing off his pants . ) We need to take two cars . GLORY No we do n't . SAM I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up to me with coleslaw on their plate . I do n't have anything to say about it . GLORY Stephen , go with your father , then , and I 'll take Grandpa . STEPHEN Am I going with Dad forever , or just to the funeral ? SAM I want you to do both those things , Stephen . I want you with me . Some new town , some other place . I 'm sorry I did n't tell you myself , but I wanted to  --  GLORY Stephen , do you remember what I told you inside ? STEPHEN Yes . GLORY All right , then . EVERETT Let 's go , Glory . GLORY I 'm ready . ( To Sam . ) You are coming . SAM Yes . We 're coming . ( After Everett and Glory have left , Sam puts on his suit jacket . ) SAM What did she tell you inside ? STEPHEN She said I should n't worry about it . She said you were just upset . She said everything would be all right . p. 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? STEPHEN No . SAM She just believes it will . STEPHEN That 's what she said . SAM Funny , huh ? STEPHEN I do n't know . SAM ( Straightening Stephen 's hair . ) Well , we can talk about it some more tonight . You 're a real smart boy , and you 'll just think your way through it . Just like any other problem . And you 'll make your decision . STEPHEN Do I look all right ? SAM You look good . STEPHEN So do you . SAM Thanks . Okay . ( Looking at Stephen . ) Do we have a handkerchief ? STEPHEN ( Pats his pocket . ) Mom gave me some Kleenex . SAM Okay , then . Here we go . ( Then quietly . ) God help us . ( They walk offstage. ) @x The lights come up , but they are not bright . It is sometime after midnight . Sam wanders into the garden and looks up at the house . There is only one light on , in that little room at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sang for Stephen in the first act and the light goes out . He sits down on the wall . Stephen opens the back door and walks out . Stephen is wearing his pajamas and a big sweater . SAM ( As Stephen sits beside him . ) Hello , Stephen . STEPHEN I waited up for you . SAM Yeah . I saw . What time did you get home ? STEPHEN I do n't know . Eight-thirty , something like that . SAM Is everybody asleep ? STEPHEN I do n't know . They probably think I 'm asleep and I 'm not , so I probably think they 're asleep and they 're not . Grandpa was pretty tired . He might be asleep . SAM Did you see Granny Butler at the supper ? STEPHEN She told me I needed a haircut . SAM What do you think ? STEPHEN I told her she smelled like bug candles . p. 53 SAM And what did she say to that ? STEPHEN She said she liked it . She said it kept the bugs away . SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then remembering . ) Oh , I 'm sorry . You already told me that . Let 's see . Did you talk to anybody else ? STEPHEN Not really . This one lady asked me if I ever met Mavis . I said yes and she asked me if I wanted a coke . ( Pause . ) But everybody was talking to Grandpa , like Mavis was almost his daughter or something . SAM She was , in a way ( Pause . ) You know what he did for her ? ( Then realizing what he is about to tell . ) If I tell you this , you 've got to promise me not to let him know you know . I mean , you ca n't ask him for it . STEPHEN What is it ? SAM Well , Mavis 's father was the custodian at the church , and her mother worked late , so when she was little , Mavis was always hanging around the church after school . And Dad did n't want her to feel she was any less than me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad sent off for the books , and learned some magic tricks for Mavis . Not big tricks , butmaking a salt shaker disappear , things like that . And it was their secret , but I found out , of course . Mavis told me . So I went right in and asked him to do it for me , but he said , " What are you talking about ? I ca n't do any magic tricks . " But I badgered him for a solid week until one night at supper , he gave in , picked up the salt shaker and said , " Watch close now . " p. 54 STEPHEN Terrific ! SAM No . Not so terrific . I watched too close , I guess . I saw how it worked and ran around the table to his jacket pocket , reached in and pulled out the salt shaker . I said , " Do n't put it in your pocket . Dad . Make it disappear . " STEPHEN You spoiled it . SAM Yes . ( Pause . ) Well . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Laughs a little . ) Oh yes . The Family Picnic . STEPHEN Come on , Dad . Did they really eat each other ? Got caught in a blizzard and ate each other ? SAM That 's all they had , Stephen . They had to eat . STEPHEN But they died anyway , the Donner Pass people . They ate each other up and it did n't save them . SAM They did what they thought they had to do . They did n't know it would n't save them . ( Pause . ) But the whole trip was like that . Day after day , they 'd left things behind , thrown out beds and chests and tools and toysto make the wagons lighter , so they could travel fasterso they could get to Donner Pass . STEPHEN If they threw everything out , what did they think they would live on once they got there ? p. 55 SAM They thought it was enough just to get there . They thought they were smart enough to figure it out , whatever it was , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All you need is your brain . Then if all you have is your brain , wellyou can eat it . STEPHEN Can we go there sometime ? I bet there 's a marker , is n't there ? Donner Pass Memorial Park or something . SAM Sure , Stephen . ( As if reading it . ) In memory of the families who died by the side of the road , because the things that would have saved them were too heavy to carry such a long way . STEPHEN Did n't anybody tell them what could happen ? SAM Yeah , probably . But they did n't listen . Other people get caught in blizzards and have to eat their families , not me . I 'm smart . STEPHEN Not smart enough , huh . SAM Nobody is smart enough . STEPHEN Somebody out there might be . Some spaceman . SAM I do n't think so , Stephen . STEPHEN ( A bit disappointed . ) Why not ? SAM See that cloud ? Straight across the sky , there ? p. 56 STEPHEN Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the Milky Way . You ca n't see it in the city , but out here , you can . ( Pause . ) The earth spins around the sun , while the sun spins around the center of the Milky Way , while the Milky Way chases Andromeda going like a billion miles an hour . We 're the spacemen , Stephen . STEPHEN ( After a moment . ) Is there a center of everything ? SAM The Big Bang Theory says there was one , but it blew up . STEPHEN Grandpa would say God did it , God lit the fuse . SAM Yes . He would . STEPHEN Did He ? ( Sam does n't answer . ) STEPHEN Is there a God , Dad ? SAM ( Taking Stephen in his arms . ) When I am out here , on this wall , in this garden , looking up at the sky , I think , yes , there is something out there . I actually want there to be something out there . I want there to be a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STEPHEN Are you feeling better , Dad ? SAM I 'm sorry about all this , Stephen . But once we get goingFirst thing in the morning , we 'll put all our things in Mavis 's car and take off . Dad does n't want it he said . So we might as well take it , do n't you think , like she left us a getaway car . When we stop for the night , you can call your mother if you want , and just see if she can guess where we are . p. 57 STEPHEN I do n't want to move , Dad . SAM You want to stay with your mother , you mean . STEPHEN I do n't want you to leave us . SAM We 'll go someplace wonderful . Northern California , maybe , with the ocean out the front door , and the redwoods out the back . And we could get a horse if you want . I always wanted a horse . STEPHEN I ca n't leave , Dad . Mom needs me . She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends than the Red Cross . STEPHEN ( Getting up off the wall now . ) It 's not the same thing . She needs me . SAM No , you 're right . That 's true . She does . I need you too , butshe said it first , huh ? STEPHEN Do n't you love Mom anymore ? SAM I guess not . STEPHEN What did she do ? SAM Nothing . STEPHEN Did you love her when you married her ? SAM Yes . STEPHEN Did she change ? SAM No. p. 58 STEPHEN Did you change ? SAM No , not really . STEPHEN So what happened to it ? SAM Stephen , there will be days when it does n't matter that you 're smart . When it wo n't help . When your extraordinary mind is of no use whatsoever . When all it will do is tell you how bad things are . STEPHEN But you told me to think about it . SAM Yes , but ( Struggling here . ) You ca n't think about this the way you would any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and read the result , because it does n't work that way . It 's like you wanted to open a bottle of beer , but all you had to use was your calculator . It would n't work . You need to use something else . STEPHEN I would sell the calculator and buy a bottle opener . ( No response from Sam . ) STEPHEN I would go next door and borrow a bottle opener . SAM I would call upstairs and ask your mother where she hid the bottle opener . STEPHEN She did n't hide it . You just did n't look . You never look . You 're out of the house for eight hours and you act like we 've taken all the stuff out of the cabinets and hidden it away like a treasure hunt . ( Imitating Sam 's call . ) Glory , where 's the peanut butter ? p. 59 SAM ( Defending himself . ) I just got home . I 'm tired . I do n't want to go looking . I want the peanut butter . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's in a box marked Dad 's Old Shoes . SAM What does she do ? Hold little indoctrination sessions with you ? STEPHEN I do n't want to move , Dad . SAM We do n't even have to stay in this country , you know . We could go to South America and become river rats . Or how about Africa . Spend the whole day outside . STEPHEN So what would I do ? Wait outside the hut all day for you to come home ? SAM You 'd go to school . STEPHEN I already go to school . And I already sit and wait for you to come home and I already do n't like it . I would n't like it any better in Africa . SAM I 'll come home . STEPHEN No you wo n't . SAM We 'll go fishing . STEPHEN No we wo n't , Dad . SAM I love you , Stephen . STEPHEN If you could stop loving Mom , you could stop loving me. p. 60 SAM No , Stephen . Your children are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your children are an accident . SAM Stephen ! STEPHEN You did n't want any children at all . I would n't even be here if it were n't for Mom . SAM Did she tell you that ? STEPHEN No , but it 's true , is n't it . Is n't it ! SAM Yes . But I did n't know I would get you . If I had known it was you , I 'd have wanted you . ( No response from Stephen . ) SAM I know I 've been gone too much and never taken any time off , but I want to change all that . I want to be with you now . STEPHEN You do n't want to do anything but work and you ca n't even do that right . What kind of doctor are you if you ca n't save your own nurse ? ( Suddenly the back-porch light comes on and Everett steps out . ) EVERETT Stephen ? Are you out there ? SAM ( More quiet , but more intense . ) Stephen , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calling again . ) Stephen ! p. 61 STEPHEN ( To Sam . ) What 's there to understand ? She 's dead . EVERETT ( To Glory , who is in the kitchen . ) They 're outside , Glory . SAM Stephen , medicine does n't always work . STEPHEN Then it might as well be magic , Dad . SAM Stephen , people die all the time . People have to die sometime . ( Everett walks out into the garden . ) STEPHEN ( Louder than necessary . ) And it 's no big deal , huh . EVERETT ( Hearing him . ) There you are . We thought we lost you . SAM ( Sees his father , but keeps talking . ) It 's sad , Stephen , but no , it 's not any big deal . STEPHEN ( Standing up . ) Well , if it 's not any big deal when people die , then it 's not any big deal when they live , or where they live , so I 'm living with Mom . ( Everett sits down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tried to save her  --  STEPHEN ( Jumping up now . ) I 'm living with Mom . p. 62 SAM Ask him ! He 'll tell you . I did everything  --  STEPHEN ( Screaming . ) I 'm living with Mom . SAM Are you listening to me ? STEPHEN Do n't call us ! Do n't come see us ! SAM Stephen ! STEPHEN ( Moving toward the house . ) Do n't come get your things ! SAM What do you want me to say ? STEPHEN But new things ! ( Stephen runs out of the garden and up the steps into the house . ) ( Sam just stands there a minute , then turns to Everett , who is still sitting by the wall . ) SAM If you 're looking for Stephen , he went inside . EVERETT ( After a moment . ) That 's good . It 's cold out here . SAM ( Very controlled . ) Then why do n't you go inside . EVERETT And do what ? SAM And talk to somebody else ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . p. 63 EVERETT I did talk to God . SAM I 'm sure you did . EVERETT He told me to come out here and sit with you , and He 'd get back to me in the morning . SAM Did He tell you what to say to me ? EVERETT No . God 's not much good on detail . SAM But you have some ideas , I guess . EVERETT Are you mad at God or me ? SAM I 'm not sure . I get you confused . EVERETT What did I do ? SAM You let Mother 's garden go to hell . EVERETT Sam , I 'm an old man . SAM You did n't deserve her . EVERETT Of course I did n't . She was a gift . Like Glory is a gift . Like Stephen is a gift . SAM She was nothing to you . Nothing at all . You never paid any attention to her . You spent all your time tending the flock . EVERETT I did love your mother , Sam . SAM You loved God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I loved God more . She knew I loved you more . p. 64 SAM You did n't love me , you loved Mavis . Yes ! You even loved Mavis more than Mother . First God , then Mavis , then the ladies in the choir , then the congregation , then the shut-ins , then the sick , then the starving Chinese and the heathen , wherever they are , then me , then Mother . EVERETT I 'm sorry if it seemed that way . SAM It was that way ! EVERETT All right . It was that way . She was last on my list . All right . But there was a power in me , like there 's a power in you , and I could n't let anything get in its way . SAM Why could n't you let anything get in its way ? What good did it do ? I mean , it did n't work , Dad . EVERETT I was called to it , Sam . Same as you . And you know your Glory understands what your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Of course , I never saved lives the way you do , but I was  --  SAM We ca n't save lives . God could n't save Mother . Medicine could n't save Mavis . Lives are lost from the start . All you do is promise them another one , and all I do is make this one last longer . But it 's our victory , not theirs . My work saves my life . Or used to . Oh boy . Day after day I 've been real proud of myself ' cause I won one more round . Right ? Wrong . Death wins . Death always wins . p. 65 EVERETT Not in my book . SAM No , not in your book . But I do n't believe in your book . I do n't , in fact , believe in anything . It has taken me my whole life , Dad , but I have finally arrived . I am free of faith . Glory be . Praise the Lord . EVERETT ( Almost laughing . ) Oh , He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM And He has to shake me to make me listen , does n't He ? EVERETT Well , I probably believed that in the old days , but God 's not as physical as He used to be . SAM That is not what you " probably believed " in the old days . That is exactly what you said from the pulpit the Sunday after Mother died . You pointed to me , sitting there on the front row of the choir , where everybody in the whole congregation could see me , and you told them the story . " There was my little boy , Samuel , sitting on his dear mother 's bed , and he did n't know she was dead , he was just sitting there , reading as loud as he could , as fast as he could , but he was shaking like a young tree in a driving rain . And I walked in and saw that she was dead and put my hands on his shoulders and made him stop shaking and made him stop reading and listen . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her reward. And he heard me . " Now by this time , they 're all crying , the whole church is crying , but you were n't through , were you ? You-walked over to me and pulled me up out of my seat in the choir and grabbed my hand and held it to your heart and you said to your congregation , " That 's what God has to do , sometimes . He has to shake us to make us listen . " p. 66 EVERETT ( Quite shaken himself . ) I did n't mean to talk about it , Sam . Not that Sunday , anyway . I just lost my place in my sermon , somehow . And everything got all blurry , all of a sudden , and all I knew was , I had to keep talking andthat was the best I could do , son . SAM Yeah , well , do you want to know what God said to me ? What I heard when I quit shaking ? EVERETT Sam , Sam SAM I heard God say , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Sam , Sam , how could you have been so dumb . " EVERETT I do n't know what to say to you , son . SAM I do n't want you to say anything to me . I want you to leave me alone . EVERETT Where am I supposed to go , Sam ? This is my house . SAM This is Mother 's house . Yours is the one with the steeple on the top . EVERETT No . That 's God 's house . SAM Then where do you live , Daddy ? I mean , when you go home , who opens the door ? EVERETT Oh , son . ( Pause . ) You do . SAM ( Very cold . ) Well I 'm awful sorry about that , Dad , but you do n't get the boy you want , you get the boy you get . p. 67 EVERETT This hurts me too much now , Sam . You 're the only one whoLook , maybe you should n't come down here anymore . I 'm happy here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pray for you and keep up with you , but well , I 'll just see you in the newspapers from now on , okay ? Maybe you 'll send Stephen to visit me now and then , but I wo n't come there , and you do n't come here , all right ? ( Sam is suddenly still , and there is a long silence . ) SAM Will Stephen forgive me ? ( Everett takes a long time here . ) EVERETT ( Quietly . ) I do n't know . Do you forgive me ? SAM ( Much more quiet . ) I do n't know . EVERETT Well then , it 's hard to say . Some of these things are inherited , I think . ( Glory comes out of the house . ) GLORY Everett ? Sam ? What are you two doing out here ? EVERETT Oh , you know . Reminiscing . GLORY Look Sam . Look what I found . I thought you gave me all your letter sweaters , but you did n't . You kept one for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sports banquet without it . p. 68 GLORY I remember that banquet . You were the only member of the cross-country team . EVERETT I remember they served cauliflower . Bless your mother 's heart , you were the only athlete who ate it . GLORY Everett , you need to put on something warmer if you 're going to stay out here . EVERETT ( Standing . ) Did Stephen go to bed ? GLORY I made him some warm milk . EVERETT I did n't think I had any milk . GLORY I made a glass for you , too . EVERETT I 'll go sit with him , then . GLORY Do n't you like milk ? EVERETT I do n't know . I 'll see . ( He goes into the house . ) GLORY ( Turning to Sam . ) Come on , Sam . Put this sweater on . ( Sam takes the sweater finally , and puts it on as he talks . ) SAM I liked that run before school every morning . Out of the housedown the streetEverybody asleep but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful , you know , like I was supposed to check out the town before everybody got up . Mile after mile , so far , so good , I 'd think . No fires , no stray dogs , and no lights on , so nobody 's sick . We did okay . We made it through another night . p. 69 GLORY You were right not to come to the supper , Sam . SAM Did they wonder where I was ? GLORY They 're used to your being gone , I think . SAM Like you . GLORY No . I 'm not used to it . But I do n't take it personally anymore . SAM Like they do . GLORY Maybe they do . I do n't know . SAM They thinkthat I thinkthat I 'm better than they are . GLORY You do ! SAM I know . They 're right . GLORY And that 's why you do n't go . You ca n't stand for them to be right . SAM That 's right . GLORY ( After a moment . ) Wellyou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I did . GLORY Your dad told one about you and Mavis , and Timmy somebody  --  he did n't remember the name  --  coming back from church camp down at Green River . And you were speeding down the road in that old Volkswagen of hers . And suddenly you saw a policeman coming up behind you and you realized not only were you all three drunk , but you did n't have your driver 's license , and you knew you 'd never get into medical school with that on your record , so Mavis said , " I 'll drive . " And you said , " What ? " And she said , " Change places with me . I 'll drive . " And you said , " Mavis , we 're going seventy miles an hour . " And she said , " Move over . " p. 70 SAM ( Realizing she does n't know the end of the story . ) Is that all he told of it ? GLORY Is there more ? SAM We climbed over each other and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , but she told me to shut up . When the police car pulled up beside us , she rolled down the window and yelled to the officer that the accelerator was stuck , and he took one look at the car , and believed her . He made some motions with his hands like she should downshift or kick the accelerator , which she did , then she hit the brake , smiled at him , pulled off the road , got out of the car , and threw up . GLORY So she was n't drunk anymore . SAM Right . GLORY Smart . SAM ( With great , unprotected joy . ) Yeah . Mavis was as smart as they come . ( Pause . ) GLORY Sam , I 've been thinking about all of this . SAM Yes . It 's that kind of night , is n't it . GLORY I think you 're right . I think I 'll go to Mother 's for a while . A month maybe . You take Stephen and go , Sam . Back to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want to fight with you now . I 'd just like a month to think . p. 71 SAM I see . GLORY I did n't bring the right clothes to suit Mother , but she 'll take me shopping , I guess . And she 's giving a big party next week . People I have n't seen in years . Maybe some of them will have learned something in the meantime . SAM Do n't count on it . GLORY My riding clothes are still out there , so that 's good . I 'll be able to check out this exercise boy of hers . SAM Uh-huh . GLORY And I thought maybe Everett might need me . We can go through Mavis 's clothes , and I 'll help him sort her letters and look at the pictures with him and hear the rest of the stories again . ( Pause . ) I 'm all packed . SAM Glory GLORY I just came out here to  --  SAM Will you not leavejust yet ? Will you sit with me awhile ? GLORY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first . ) When you went to the supper , I drove over to Mavis 's house . Where they lived when we were kids , I mean . I do n't even know who lives there now . I just parked out front for a while . I always liked that house . Those lilac bushes are still there , remember ? p. 72 GLORY Sure I do . All over the place . SAM And for one moment , I was sixteen and I had it all to do over again . And I could forget your hair , and forget your mouth and your smell , and love Mavis . Marry her . Somebody exactly like me . Somebody who believed in hard work , who could n't wait to be an adult . Somebody who never read " Sleeping Beauty " and never said a prayer except , " God let me stay awake long enough to get everything finished . " GLORY You were two of a kind all right . SAM And in the next moment , the moment after I was sixteen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted your hair in my mouth , in my eyes , all over me . I wanted to catch you swimming naked in your pond . I knew you did it . You told me you did it . GLORY ( Confessing . ) Of course I did . I wanted you to catch me . SAM I never had a chance . I hopped over to that pond like every frog in every fairy tale my mother ever read me , and you kissed me , and I believed . I remember that kiss , I can still taste the butterscotch sucker I took out of your mouth to have that kiss , and I 'm still dizzy and hot all of a sudden , and I remember loving you . ( Pause . ) And I guess that kisswas the last I ever saw of Mavis. p. 73 GLORY Bless her heart , she worshipped you . I knew it , everybody knew it . SAM So , once I was in love with you , she had to go to nursing school , did n't she ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a truck or something . ( Glory laughs but knows it 's true . ) SAM Right . Nursing school was her last chance to get my attention , but it did n't work . I did n't look at her in high school and I have n't looked at her since . Why should I look ? I knew she 'd be there . GLORY Sam SAM Mavis was two feet away from me , across the table from me , her whole life , and what did she get from this life with me ? Nothing . Invitations to dinner from you . Tennis on Saturday with you . The four of us at the movies , me sound asleep and Mavis holding the popcorn between you and Stephen . Nothing . GLORY Mavis got as much from you as you would let her have . That 's all she wanted . You 're a genius . People make exceptions . They settle . SAM You have done more than settle . You have bet your lives on me . It was worse for Mavis , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had any right to count on me , but you did , and I let you , and now , instead of saving any of you  --  p. 74 GLORY Is that what you think you 're doing in our lives , saving us ? SAM I want to help you . GLORY We 're all right down here . We think our little thoughts and we have our silly troubles and we fight our losing battles as bravely as we can . The last thing we need is for you to come in and solve our problems for us . Our problems , Sam , are how we fill up our days . SAM It 's easier for you in the winter , I guess . Your days are shorter . GLORY ( A flash of anger . ) I do n't need you to save me ! ( Then recovering . ) I just need you tobe on my side whenever you can . ( When he does n't respond , she continues . ) See mehear megive me some room , and save me some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) GLORY I 've already got a God , Sam . And I see Him all the time , everywhere I go . And He may seem limited and primitive to you , but the dances are fun and the songs are sweet , and every day is a holy day . SAM So what is your God doing tonight ? GLORY I do n't know . Maybe He 's justwatering the grass . p. 75 SAM Okay . I ca n't save you . But neither do I have the right to destroy you all . GLORY I am not destroyed ! I 'm mad at you because you 're acting like this , but I am not destroyed . And if you think you destroyed Mavisif you 're out here feeling sorry for MavisMavis had you all day , Sam . Mavis had the best of you ! I never had the conversations she had with you . I never sweated with you for twelve hours to work one of your miracles . We  --  you and I  --  never held our breath till the dead marr sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) GLORY No , Sam . Do n't feel sorry for Mavis . And do n't be mad at me . I have been  --  Stephen and I have been  --  happy , all these years , to have what was left over when Mavis finished with you . SAM So you 're happy she 's gone . GLORY ( Horrified . ) How can you say that ? SAM You sounded jealous , that 's all . GLORY I was jealous . You loved her . But that does n't  --  SAM No , Glory . I did n't love her . I had every opportunity to , but I did n't . GLORY WellI loved her . And I think she loved me . And right now , I 'm feeling real lost without her . p. 76 SAM She was jealous of you . GLORY What on earth for ? SAM You 've got it all . GLORY I 've got you , you mean . SAM You 're a great-looking woman and Stephen adores you , and you float through everything like you 're on alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Mavis had to work hard for everything she ever had , while youwell , youjust enjoy yourself . GLORY Listen , Sam . It 's not as easy as it looks . SAM Yeah , well , you 've had a lot of practice . GLORY ( In a rage . ) I did not agree to sit here and take the blame for this . It 's not my fault ! ( She starts for the house . ) SAM I did n't love her , I used her . And thenwhen she really needed meShe was counting on me to see it , Glory , only I was n't looking . And I was n't looking because I did n't want to see it . Other people die , Glory  --  not me , not my family , not my friend ! GLORY None of us were looking , Sam . Three weeks ago , I knew she looked awful . I told her to get a haircut . p. 77 SAM It 's the thirteenth fairy , see . You do n't invite her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she comes anyway , because she lives there , just like you do . But you forgot , did n't you ? GLORY Sam SAM I forgot Mavis was alive and she died . GLORY You were trying to save her ! SAM I was showing off ! I could fix it . I could pull her through . I could make it disappear . She could have lived for months . A year maybe , but no , I have to go in and save her . GLORY Even if it was a mistake SAM I believed I could save her . GLORY Well you could n't . SAM So now I just turn around and believe I could n't ? GLORY Yes ! SAM No ! It was the belief that was the problem in the first place ! I believed in everything . I even believed in you  --  or love , I guess . Did n't I ? Yes . And in God , and fairy tales , and medicine and the power of my own mind and none of it works ! GLORY Samplease SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He does ! I see it ! After everything I 've told him , he still wants to believe . But how can I let him believe when I know what happens , when there is no good reason for what happens , when there is no reason to believe . p. 78 GLORY ( Trying another tack . ) Sam , you 've got this all mixed up . You married me because I 'm good for you , and you operated on Mavis because you were the best one to do it , because she wanted you to do it , because you wanted to do it . SAM No ! ( In his own private hell now . ) I believed , once again , I believed I might be able to do something and ( Very distant , suddenly . ) Mavis believed I could save her and all the faith in the world would n't save her . Wo n't save any of us . Wo n't do a thing except make fools of us . Give us tests we can not pass . Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in absolute submission to accident , to the arbitrary assignment of unbearable pain , and the everyday occurrence of meaningless death . Only then can we believe that dreams , like deadly whirlpools , drown us in their frenzythat love blazes across a black sky like a comet but never returnsand that time , like a desert wind , blows while I sleep , and erases the path I walked to here , and erases the path that leads on . ( Sam 's anger has been so raw and so violent that he now simply stands , but we are certain he will not speak for quite a while . ) GLORY ( Without looking up . ) Oh , SamOh , sweet baby ( Now standing up , but not looking at Sam . ) I went in to see her , you know Tuesday morning , and she 'd already had her shot , so she was pretty dopey , but she said , well , she said a lot of things . " Well , " she said , " it looks like Sam 's gon na get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks to Sam for a response but there is none . As Glory continues , Sam walks slowly downstage and sits on a rock and buries his head in his hands. ) p. 79 GLORY Anyway , then she said , " GlorySam might not be able to fix this , you know . I might not be there for him , this time , when he needs meI might not be as helpful as I have been . I 'll be asleep , see , that 's my excuse . Anyway , if I do n't make itI want him to know what I lovedwhy I loved him . It was only one thing he did , really . We were ten years old , and Everett had this magic trick and Sam knew how it worked , and he showed me how it worked . He knew it was n't magic , and he knew it did n't always work , and he was n't afraid to know . Tell him that 's why I loved him . He was n't afraid to know . " Then she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . I 'm not afraid either . " ( As Glory and Sam remain seated , spent , on the ground , the back door opens and Stephen comes out . ) STEPHEN Mom ? GLORY You need to be in bed , honey . STEPHEN Are you going to sleep out here ? GLORY I do n't know . STEPHEN Want me to get you a blanket ? GLORY No thanks , sweetie . I 'm going to stand up , justany minute now . STEPHEN What 's the matter with Dad ? GLORY It 's just late , honey . He 's real tired . p. 80 STEPHEN Why does n't he say anything ? GLORY He just needs to be quiet now , Stephen . STEPHEN ( Walking toward Sam . ) Dad ? GLORY Come over here if you want to . Keep me warm . ( Stephen comes to sit down with Glory and they hug . ) STEPHEN Maybe we should eat again . GLORY Anything sound good to you ? STEPHEN No . GLORY Did you and Grandpa have a nice talk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese checkers , but , well he lost his marbles . GLORY ( Laughing . ) Did you say that or did he ? STEPHEN I did . He saidhe could n't find them . But I thoughtyou could use a joke . GLORY Boy , is that the truth . I 'd give you a dollar for it STEPHEN if you had a dollar . GLORY You got it . STEPHEN I 'll put it on your bill . GLORY Done . p. 81 STEPHEN Maybe he 's asleep . GLORY Who ? STEPHEN Dad . GLORY He might be asleep . But I would n't say anything you do n't want him to hear . STEPHEN ( Picking up the geode . ) What 's this ? GLORY I do n't know . A rock . STEPHEN It 's round . Rocks are n't round . GLORY I do n't know , Stephen . Ask your father . STEPHEN You ask him . GLORY You 're the one who wants to know . STEPHEN Maybe it goes in the wall . ( Stephen gets up and walks around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one point he gets close to Sam , but Glory motions for Stephen to go around him . ) STEPHEN A rock this big ought to be heavier . ( Glory does n't know how to answer him , so she just smiles and watches . ) STEPHEN How did it get so round ? GLORY I do n't know , Stephen . ( Everett comes out of the house and takes a couple of steps . He is very reluctant to interrupt this , whatever it is. ) p. 82 EVERETT I 'll say good night , I guess . GLORY Good night , Everett . EVERETT You can come inside now , if you want . I 'm going to bedand there 's chairs in here . GLORY We 're all right , Everett . EVERETT Well , then ( He looks at Sam , then at Glory , who shakes her head and motions for Everett not to say anything . ) STEPHEN Grandpa , do you know what this rock is ? EVERETT No , Stephen . STEPHEN I found it out here in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs . I brought that one out here to look at one day . STEPHEN But whose are they ? Where did they come from ? EVERETT They 're Mary 's . STEPHEN Who 's Mary ? EVERETT Your grandmother . Sam 's mother . GLORY I saw those dancing pictures upstairs , Everett . If she danced as great as she looked , she was a real catch . EVERETT ( Pleased to be invited to come talk . ) She sure was . And nobody could understand why she married the preacher except she was having a better time than anybody else and she had to find some way to pay for it . p. 83 GLORY She sounds like me . EVERETT If she were alive today , she 'd bake you a batch of chocolate chips and eat them every one while they were still hot . Then she 'd send you the wax paper she baked them on and write you a note , telling you to let her know the minute you went off your diet . STEPHEN And she liked these rocks ? EVERETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't even know she had them till she died . I was looking for a list she made , who she wanted to have her piano , things like that , and I found them . I found a lot of things . I found the world she lived in , a world I knew very little about . I know she loved me , but I do n't know why . She must have loved those rocks , but I do n't know what they are . ( Now he looks at Sam . ) I guess you can be a real big part of somebody else 's world without ever understanding the first thing about it . Somebody can give you their life and you 'll never know why Never know what they wanted from you , or if they ever got it . Then when they die , well , knowing so little about these people makes it real hard to lose them . ( Pause . ) I kept meaning to ask Sam about those rocks . I know she 'd want him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a rock . It 's a geode. p. 84 STEPHEN ( Running down to him . ) You mean with the crystals inside ? SAM Yes . STEPHEN Well , let 's open it up and see it ! Where 's the hammer ? SAM ( Sudden alarm . ) No ! ( Then more quietly . ) Once you crack themShe did n't like to crack them . STEPHEN Then how do you know what 's in there ? SAM You do n't . She saidit was better for it to be safe than for you to know what it was , exactly . STEPHEN Dad ? SAM I 'm here , Stephen . ( He sits , but still holds the geode . ) I thought I could save Mavis . ( To Stephen . ) I thought I could protect you . I ca n't do any of those things . I do n't know what I can do . I do n't know what to say . I have nothing for you . STEPHEN ( Pointing to the geode . ) I 'll take that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mine . EVERETT Yes it is. p. 85 SAM It 's nothing . STEPHEN It 's okay . I like it . SAM I like it too . When Mother died I gathered them up and put them in that drawer . Yes , you can have it . It'syour mystery now . STEPHEN ( Taking the geode . ) Thanks . ( There is silence all around ) STEPHEN Dad ? SAM Yes . STEPHEN Where did she go , Dad ? SAM Where did Mavis go ? STEPHEN Yes . ( And there is more silence . ) SAM I do n't know , Stephen . STEPHEN I saw her in the coffin , but it was n't her . GLORY ( Gently . ) It was her , Stephen . STEPHEN I mean , she was n't there anymore . SAM No . STEPHEN ( Carefully . ) Did you see it go , Dad ? SAM What ? STEPHEN ( Still very careful . ) In the operating room ? Did you cut her open and it got out ? ( And Sam does n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger turned to grief and longing . Glory , Everett and Stephen are silent and perfectly still. ) p. 86 SAM Yes . ( Pause . ) I cut her open and it got out . I was standing there over her and STEPHEN ( Quietly . ) What was it like ? ( Now very slowly . ) Could you feel it or see it or hear it ? Was it cold or white or like air maybe or what ? ( And Sam stands there a moment , searching for the answer , searching for the memory , trying to see it again . Finally , he shakes his head . The words are coming , but he has no idea what they are . ) SAM It was ( And suddenly , the words come from him the way " it " came from Mavis in that moment . ) It was forgiveness . ( Sam stands there quietly a moment , as a kind of peace seems to come over him , and then over Everett , and then Glory . Stephen , however , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , Dad ? SAM I do n't know , Stephen . For whatever I did . For all those years . STEPHEN Did she forgive me for losing her cat ? SAM ( Not directly to Stephen , and not quickly . ) Yes , Stephen . EVERETT ( Quietly . ) I wondered what happened to that cat . Every week , on the phone , I had to say hello to that damn cat . p. 87 STEPHEN ( To Everett . ) I did n't mean to lose Peaches , she just  --  GLORY ( Interrupting him , to soothe him . ) It 's all right , Stephen . I owed Mavis money . SAM You ? What for ? GLORY ( A bit embarrassed as the story begins . ) I had my eyes done . Last March when I told you I came to see Mother , I flew to Chicago and had my eyes done . I did n't want you to know it , so I borrowed the money from Mavis . SAM And I never noticed it . GLORY No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . ( Then inspecting more carefully . ) Great work . GLORY She said we had to preserve your illusions . SAM I like it . GLORY That 's good . It was a lot of money . EVERETT It was four thousand dollars . SAM I did n't know Mavis had any money . EVERETT It was my money . GLORY I did n't know that . p. 88 EVERETT I did n't know it was for you . SAM ( To Everett . ) I 'll pay you back . EVERETT Good . GLORY Thank you anyway , Everett . EVERETT ( After a moment . ) I owe you an apology , Glory . GLORY What on earth ? EVERETT I told Mavis your marriage would n't last . That your mother was stingy with her money and your looks would n't last forever . I told her if she 'd just wait , she could have Sam all to herself . STEPHEN Why did you do that ? EVERETT It was an old dream of mine . SAM You were wrong . EVERETT I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , Glory . GLORY It 's all right , Everett . You did n't know . SAM ( After a moment . ) I 'm the one who needs to apologize to you , Glory . GLORY It 's all right , Sam . p. 89 SAM I only wanted to leave because  --  GLORY You do n't have to tell me that , Sam . SAM I do n't know why I wanted to leave you . I ca n't leave you . But maybe I did n't want to hurt you like Imaybe I was afraid I would lose you , too . GLORY Sam , it 's been a sad , sad day . We 're all so lonely for her , we 've all said things . SAM Yeah , I know , but I said mine on purpose . GLORY You were mad . SAM That does n't make it right . I need you . I love you . GLORY I know , Sam . I tried to tell you that this afternoon . SAM I guess I was n't listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you were . SAM ( Takes his time before he begins . ) Glory , if you couldhold on a little longer , I want to be a better man . GLORY I can do that , Sam . ( He shakes his head , first out of relief ; and then in confusion . ) GLORY You do n't understand , do you . ( He shakes his head no. ) p. 90 GLORY I 'd explain it to you if I could , or maybe you 'll explain it to me in a week or so , or maybe we 'll just love each other anyway and never know . SAM Pleaseforgive me . ( And Glory extends her arms to Sam , and they embrace . And when they break the embrace he sees his father . ) SAM And DadI 'm sorry , Dad . EVERETT I 'm all right , son . SAM No , Dad . I want you to know that I  --  EVERETT I said it 's all right , son . SAM I love you , Dad . EVERETT Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm cold . Is anybody else cold ? It 's cold out here . ( And Sam knows they are all waiting for him to speak , to say whether he is finished here . ) SAM Well , maybewe couldgo in the house . I did n't think I wanted to go in the house , but now  --  EVERETT I have n't changed a thing , Sam . SAM Yes , well , ( Smiling at Everett and himself. ) that 's what I was afraid of . ( Glory squeezes his hand or laughs a little at him , and Everett shakes his head , but they are all still waiting for Sam to make the next move. ) p. 91 SAM Dad , if it 's all right with Stephen and Glory , we 'd like to stay here a few days , if it is n't too much trouble . STEPHEN Hey ! Great ! EVERETT What do you mean ? You have to stay here . You have n't finished cleaning up this garden . And Stephen has n't read all my books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought home from the supper . GLORY ( Gathering up something she has brought outside . ) You ca n't eat all that food because Josie Barnett ca n't cook . I thought people in the country could cook . EVERETT ( Now moving toward the house . ) What Josie Barnett ca n't do is sing . None of these girls can sing a lick . I keep praying I 'll go deaf , but then ( Looking to heaven , but aware that he 's making a joke . ) I ask Him for so much . ( Stephen follows Everett 's eyes to the heavens and finds the stars . ) STEPHEN ( As though they were in the middle of a conversation about stars . ) But Dad , what holds the stars up there ? Why do n't they fall ? ( And there is a pause , while Sam does n't explain it . ) EVERETT Sam , what was that other verse , do you remember , that other verse of " Twinkle , Twinkle . " p. 92 GLORY I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a real verse , but Sam 's mother sure said it all the time . SAM No , it was a real verse . I remember reading it . I just do n't remember EVERETT ( Getting it now . ) As your bright and tiny spark SAM ( Remembering . ) Yes , yes . ( Then repeating . ) Guides the traveler in the darkThough I know not what you areTwinkle , twinkle little star . ( He continues to look at the stars. )
