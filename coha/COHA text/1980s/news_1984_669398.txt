' ' I could only afford to share an apartment , but it was hard to find someone who was willing to live with a child , ' ' she says . ' ' It was a very frustrating experience. ' ' // One day ' ' it occurred to me if we could get single parents together we could help each other . I wondered how many ( single parents ) there were out there and how many were struggling for housing. ' ' // She ran a small advertisement encouraging single parents to contact her if they were interested in shared housing. // ' ' I was deluged with responses , ' ' she says . Soon afterward , with funds from a private donor , Ms. Riordan launched the Single Parent Alliance to help single parents and their children team up in shared-living arrangements. // So far the organization has helped about 1 , 000 parents and their children find affordable living situations with other single parents . About 90 percent of the clients are women. // ' ' Many of these women were middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of them have college degrees , ' ' says Ms. Riordan. // The Single Parent Alliance is among several organizations around the country that help match single parents of the same sex in shared-living arrangements . Directors of such programs say sharing a house or an apartment can help defray living costs while providing both the adults and children with companionship and a supportive atmosphere during times of transition . In some cases the parents are able to stagger their work schedules so one parent can be home with the children . They may also split transportation costs by sharing a car. // ' ' In a good match parents can cut costs across the board , ' ' says Judy Fowler , director of the Shared Housing Project sponsored by Catholic Social Services in San Jose , Calif . ' ' This puts them in a more secure position to be able to move on to something else , perhaps after getting job training or finding a new job .

Most of the single parents are women with incomes of $9 , 000 to $10 , 000 , but men are increasingly seeking help as more fathers gain custody of their children . From June 1983 to June 1984 , the Shared Housing Project housed about 500 families. // Nationally , Census Bureau figures show the numbers of single-parent households have risen steadily since the early 1970s . Currently there are more than 6. 5 million , the vast majority headed by women . These figures do not account for single parents living with relatives or friends or those in shelters. // Women with children may face discrimination from landlords who prefer to rent to single professionals or married couples with two incomes . Single women with small babies may not want to work right away , and for mothers who do work , child-care costs can eat up a substantial portion of their paycheck. // Myra Contreras , a single mother with a 11/2-year-old son , was only able to afford a studio apartment in Santa Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two people. // Last July , she and her son , Christian , teamed up with another single mother , Sue Beverage , and her 13-year-old daughter , Dana .

' ' The good thing is you can give each other moral support . It ' s really nice to have someone who is in the same situation - someone as a single parent - you can relate to. ' ' // Kathryn Sears , a mother with two young children at home , is also happy with her house-sharing arrangement . Last February , she found it necessary to rent out a room to another mother and her child in order to afford payments on their four-bedroom San Jose home. // ' ' I ' m really pleased with this because it allows my children to remain in their own environment , ' ' says Ms. Sears , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother with a child joined the Sears household , which now includes four children ranging in age from 3 to 71/2. // ' ' They ' re all basically easygoing kids , ' ' Ms. Sears says . ' ' They have their ups and downs , but generally they get along well. ' ' // The mothers trade off responsibilities such as picking children up from day care or watching children when they come home from school . They also share the housecleaning and other chores. // ' ' I couldn ' t ask for two better roommates , ' ' Ms. Sears says. // Some of the challenges facing single-parent housemates are similar to those of other roommate situations , such as establishing ground rules for guests , dividing responsibilities for household chores , and learning to live together in close quarters. // ' ' When a parent is desperate ( she ) may not ask any questions before moving into a shared arrangement , ' ' says Ms. Riordan of the Single Parent Alliance . ' ' This can make for problems down the line.

With another adult in the household , parents have more freedom to slip away for a quick errand or to accept a spontaneous invitation to dinner or a movie. // ' ' It ' s closer to a family environment , ' ' she says .
