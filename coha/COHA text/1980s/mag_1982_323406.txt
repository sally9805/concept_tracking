Philadelphia celebrates its realist genius , Thomas Eakins <P> A As from this week , through Aug. 1 , anyone interested in realist painting must go to Philadelphia . American artists who call themselves realists should , if necessary , be dragged there by the collar ; the experience waiting for them will be salutary and humbling . The Philadelphia Museum of Art is having a commemorative show of Thomas Eakins . It marks no particular date of his own . Eakins was born in 1844 , and he died in 1916 . But he passed his whole life , except for four years of European study , in Philadelphia , and his genius-hardly too strong a word , this time-is a proper thing to celebrate in that city 's 300th anniversary year . <P> Eakins is the greatest realist painter America has so far produced . He never successfully idealized a subject . When theatrical , which he rarely was , he tended to look silly . He was pragmatic , cussed , inquisitive , thoroughgoing , relentlessly observant , and plain of pictorial speech : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with the specific that one scholar managed to compute , from the sun 's angle , the time and date of the scene depicted in one of his paintings of rowers training on the Schuylkill , The Pair-Oared Shell ; they went under the bridge , give or take a few seconds , at 7:20 p.m. on either May 28 or July 27 , 1872 . <P> In order to fix the facts he loved-the blurred motion of a spoked wheel , the tilt of a catboat beating to windward , the awkward play of a naked boy 's legs as he dives-Eakins produced a mass of preparatory work , in many mediums . Convinced that the camera was truth , he took photographs and worked from them ; he was one of the first American artists to do so . He made drawing after drawing , from mere thumbnail sketches to stupendously elaborate perspective studies that include notes on such minutiae as eight cross sections of an oar from loom to blade , or the reflection of a distant bush in a ripple of water . To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in wax . <P> All this output can not go in one show ; it would have been burdensome to even the most dedicated Eakins student . Instead , the exhibition 's curator , Art Historian Barrel Sewell , has intelligently chosen some 150 paintings , studies and photographs to provide a thematic , rather than a chronological approach . There are certain broad categories of imagery in Eakins . There are the rowing and sporting and sailing scenes . There are the paintings of medical and scientific inquiry . There are the horse pictures , the portraits , and so on . By sampling each of these , Sewell hoped to build up a convincing picture of Eakins ' main preoccupations , and of the growth of his style .
