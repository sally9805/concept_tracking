Officials ignore new clues <P> Sixteen sets of fingerprints . A revealing smear of red paint . Ballistics tests on high-powered rifle bullets . A collection of such solid clues has raised serious new questions about the official investigation into the brutal murder late last year of three American nuns and a lay religious worker in El Salvador . But TIME has learned that while the inquiry has turned up an impressive amount of hard evidence about what took place , Salvadoran authorities are stonewalling , stubbornly refusing to press the inquiry to the point where their own security forces might become implicated . <P> When the American women missionaries were found shot to death last December , U.S. officials cited " circumstantial evidence of possible security force involvement . " But Salvadoran police and military officers dragged their feet in trying to track down the killers of the women , prompting the Carter Administration to suspend all U.S. aid to El Salvador until a " complete , thorough and professional investigation " of the murders had been undertaken . A four-man Salvadoran commission of inquiry was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help . <P> Then came last month 's offensive by El Salvador 's leftist guerrillas . The U.S. <P> moved swiftly to restore $5 million in nonlethal military aid and add $5 million in weapons and ammunition . One reason cited for the resumption was a vague claim by the State Department of " progress " in the murder investigation . <P> In fact , the only real progress has been made by the FBI agents and other independent investigators . <P> Some of the FBI team 's findings : <P> &gt; Sixteen sets of latent fingerprints were lifted from the burned , blackened paint of the white Toyota microbus the four women were driving the night they were killed . <P> &#gt; The microbus bore a smear of red paint , where it had apparently scraped against another vehicle . Peasants in the area reported seeing the microbus being towed by a red vehicle . <P> &gt; Although official Salvadoran doctors refused to perform autopsies at the time , two of the nuns ' bodies were later exhumed in the U.S. and bullets were removed from them . Ballistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from are a type regularly used by the security forces . <P> &gt; The names of all security forces personnel on duty in the area where the women were killed , about 20 men , were established . Some were national police troops ; others belonged to the Hacienda ( Treasury ) Police . <P> The next steps should have been simple . The fingerprints of the 20 policemen could have been compared with the prints on the microbus . The weapons issued to the men that night could have been examined and ballistics tests performed . A search could have been made for a red vehicle . The Salvadoran government has failed to take any of these steps . <P> It is unlikely that the U.S. will apply any further pressure to find the killers .
