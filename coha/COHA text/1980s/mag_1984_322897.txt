Most people know the urge to chuck it all . Almost two years ago , William Catterson acted on that dark impulse . He worked nights as an assistant manager of a fast-food restaurant ; his wife worked days as a teacher , leaving Catterson at home in Lodi , N.J. , to take care of their two small children . The marriage became strained . One night , after calling to say he would be home late from work , Catterson took a bus to Atlantic City , and then headed for Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , where he lived and worked under an assumed name . <P> Last week Catterson saw his photo in an ad for an HBO film , Missing Persons : Four True Stories . He returned to New Jersey and saw the program in a motel room . After watching the scenes of his grieving family , Catterson went to the Lodi police , who helped track them down . Ironically , they had moved to Tarpon Springs , Fla. , about 200 miles from Catterson 's new home . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the returned husband and father : " It looks like everything 's working out wonderfully for us. "
