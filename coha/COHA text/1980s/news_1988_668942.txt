More than 1 , 200 Salvadoran refugees returning home after up to eight years in a Honduran refugee camp were stranded at the border Sunday because of a dispute over U.S. church people accompanying them . The refugees ' convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks carrying their belongings was halted on the Honduran side 500 yards from the border late Saturday . They had left the Mesa Grande refugee camp 30 miles to the north under an accord worked out among the refugees , the Salvadoran government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , which is overseeing the repatriation . Jose Maria Mendiluce , the UN commissioner ' s Central American director , said the presence of the 15 U.S. church workers-members of the Going Home organization-was not contemplated in the accord . Salvadoran Interior Minister Edgar Belloso Funes told reporters at the border Sunday that his government " welcomes with open arms " the Salvadoran refugees . " But the so-called internationalists among them are using our brothers for strictly political ends . They are coming here to break our laws , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted entry . " Amadeo Lopez , a returning refugee and member of the community ' s directorate , said the group insists the U.S. church workers be allowed to enter . He said the refugees are determined to wait in their mile-long convoy until their demand is met . " We want free entry into our country , and with the foreigners accompanying us , because we don ' t want to be interrogated , " one refugee told local radio station YSU . But the 1 , 230 refugees , who included hundreds of infants and small children , had little food and appeared unprepared to spend days sitting on the road . Louis Vitale , a Roman Catholic priest from Oakland and spokesman for the Going Home delegation , blamed the Salvadoran government for the standoff . " This is part of the Salvadoran government ' s continuing efforts to obstruct the refugees ' return , " he said , adding that all members of his delegation had visas for El Salvador . Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoran refugees .

The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas fighting the U.S.-supported government . About 4 , 300 refugees returned last year . The Salvadoran government is concerned about their political sympathies and the burden they may place on an economy devastated by war . But a regional peace accord signed last August underscored the right of refugees to return home , and the government eventually cooperated with the return . The refugees intend to return to three towns in Chalatenango from which they fled in the early 1980s . Sofia Enriquez , 25 , who left Los Ranchos in 1982 , stood beside a bus and held her infant daughter while another daughter clutched her skirt . Both girls were born in Mesa Grande . Asked why she had left , she said : " We were persecuted . They were killing people just for the fun of it. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
