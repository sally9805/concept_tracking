When the national legislature handed down criminal charges in February against former Dictator Luis Garcia Meza , citing acts of sedition , armed revolt and assassination , many hoped that the anticipated supreme court trial would clean up the image of a nation tarnished by a flagrant cocaine trade , official corruption and worse . Last week , after three brief sessions , the trial ground to a halt . As the civilian government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro stood by , the twelve-member supreme court proved unable to come up with a quorum of judges to reconvene the case . Said a well-placed diplomatic observer : " People are afraid . There 's no question about that . " <P> In all , nine justices have removed themselves from the Garcia Meza case . It is no wonder : on April 23 a replacement judge was mysteriously shot and wounded . Garcia Meza , 53 , has done nothing to dissipate the atmosphere of intimidation . When he unexpectedly strode into court last month to defend himself , ending four years of exile and hiding , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in an army garrison outside the city of Sucre , where the trial is being held . <P> In July 1980 , Garcia Meza wrenched power from civilian hands in what has become known as the Cocaine Coup . U.S. Bolivian Affairs Expert James Malloy wrote then that the Garcia Meza government was a " rapacious , uniformed kleptocracy , " openly in league with drug dealers . As major suppliers of the coca paste that is processed into cocaine , Bolivian drug traffickers earn some $3 billion a year . <P> In 1982 a subsequent military government handed the government back to civilians . Paz Estenssoro , 78 , took office last August and imposed austerity measures on an economy paralyzed by a 24,000% inflation rate , widespread labor unrest and a foreign debt of $4.8 billion . Says Paz Estenssoro : " We are attempting to rescue the country from ruin . " The job has been complicated by the worldwide collapse in the prices of tin and natural gas , two key sources of export earnings . <P> Modest economic progress , however , could be destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confident that the Garcia Meza trial will not provoke one , but many officials privately doubt whether the former dictator will be brought to justice .
