How sick is Konstantin Chernenko ? <P> The topic is discussed constantly in Moscow these days , for clearly understandable reasons . The Soviet party leader and President , 73 , who is believed to be suffering from emphysema , has been absent from public view for about a month . Soviet television last showed an apparently frail Chernenko on Dec. 27 , handing out awards at a Kremlin ceremony . Three days earlier he had missed the funeral of Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov , held in Red Square on a bitterly cold day . <P> By its own secretive standards , the Kremlin has been relatively candid about the fact that Chernenko is having health difficulties . A member of the Soviet Central Committee is reported to have told a visiting French official two weeks ago that Chernenko was ailing . Since then , the Kremlin has dropped hints that the President 's condition is not serious . On Moscow 's somewhat cloistered cocktail party circuit , Soviet officials have been quietly confirming to foreign diplomats that Chernenko is ill . Some of the Soviet gossipers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The problem , as always , is how to evaluate the ephemeral evidence . Chernenko 's predecessor , Yuri Andropov , who died last February after being out of public view for six months , had been said by Kremlin officials to be recuperating from a slight ailment just a few weeks before his death . On Nov. 7 , Politburo Member Victor Grishin told a Western newsman that Marshal Ustinov had only " a little sore throat . " Ustinov died of cardiac arrest following pneumonia on Dec. 20 . <P> Even though Chernenko 's health probably caused the last-minute postponement of a Warsaw Pact summit meeting earlier this month , the Soviet press worked hard at creating the illusion that the President was at his desk in the Kremlin . With TV cameras recording the event on Jan. 19 , party officials nominated him in his absence for a seat on the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic , a post of no significance . They released statements in Chernenko 's name congratulating Syrian President Hafez Assad on his re-election as head of his country 's ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week the Soviet press published the text of Chernenko 's reply to a letter from a Canadian student , Laurie Piraux , 18 , of Calgary , Alta. , who had asked Chernenko what could be done to secure world peace . His letter was ominously reminiscent of the one Andropov sent two years ago to Maine Schoolgirl Samantha Smith , inviting her to visit the Soviet Union . By the time Samantha arrived with her parents in July 1983 , Andropov was apparently too ill to receive her . He made one more public appearance , in August 1983 , before , disappearing from public view . His death was announced on Feb. 10 . <P> Late last week , the official Soviet news agency TASS announced an event that may offer further insight into Chernenko 's condition : Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will make an official visit to Moscow in mid-February . Because Papandreou is a head of government rather than a head of state , protocol requires only that he be received by Soviet Premier Nikolai Tikhonov . But Moscow has been courting Papandreou 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitting , would almost certainly want to take part in Kremlin talks with the Greek visitor .
