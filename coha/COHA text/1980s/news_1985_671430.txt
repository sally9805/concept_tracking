The memoir was by one George N. Kates , a somewhat oddball Hollywood movie set designer who went to Peking in 1933 . Kates describes in loving detail the ancient rooms around a courtyard where he lived for seven years , a place that had all the classic elements of a scholar ' s house : the double entry doors , the lacquer tiles , the spreading linden tree in the inner court , the latticed windows , the parade of itinerant hawkers selling fresh crabs or five-flavored tea- soaked eggs , the lotus plant in a central pool in which the sky and sometimes the moon were reflected. // Fifty years later , Peking was a city that combined a careless destruction of its old neighborhoods with cement blocks of apartment houses extreme in their lack of charm . And yet , when I think of the places I occupied in Peking , they come back to me in retrospect with as powerful a flavor as the rooms of Mr. Kates . They had no rose lacquer columns , no spreading linden trees , no intricate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese , both the old style and Communist variety. // My first residence was a room in the Qianmen , an airy hotel named after one of the few old imperial gates to Peking not torn down by the present authorities . Stylistically , it has nothing in common with either the gate it was named for or the low- slung , tile-roofed homes of its neighborhood . A rectangle on the Stalinist model built in the 1950 ' s , the hotel reached for a certain grandness but achieved only a seedy , drab , dingy sort of pompousness . The lofty entry lobby was so dimly lighted that the ceiling was nearly as invisible as the stars on a cloudy night. // Several of my journalistic colleagues also lived in the Qianmen . I had arrived in China in 1980 , not long after the Government had decided to open its doors to more contact with the outside world . There was a flood of new residents , and very few of them could be accommodated in the for-foreigners-only walled compounds. // The Qianmen ( pronounced Chee- en-mun ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms having been booked by the state-run travel service , which was bringing Western and Japanese tourists to China in great busloads . My first days there , I slept in the spare bed of a colleague , roaming the corridors in the early-morning hours , hoping to catch another long- term resident in the process of leaving . One morning , I knocked on the door of Room 753 , having heard that a Singapore businessman who lived there was vacating the premises . It was 6 A.M. ; the man came to the door wrapped in a towel . He was indeed leaving , he said . I applied for the room , and , miraculously , it was mine. // It was a nice room ; indeed it was a kind of suite . On the one side was a small sitting area built around a faded blue rug . There were anti- macassars draped over the backs of my couch and my chairs , giving the room a somewhat old-fashioned , musty air . There was a desk . The ceiling was so high that an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colored stone could be accommodated on one wall . A grandiose velvet curtain , New Orleans-bordello red , divided this part of the room from the other half , which was where the bed and dresser and bathroom were . There was usually , but not always , hot running water. // There was dust everywhere ; it blew in through cracks in the windows and reminded you of how close Peking stood to the great Mongolian desert . Outside , the street was lined with sycamore trees . During the day , it was busy with noisy traffic , buses , cars and gear-grinding trucks , all of them blowing their horns , part of the routine of driving in China . At night , farmers from the outlying regions drove herds of sheep through the city , and their bleating made me dream of rural fields and farms. // As the weeks passed , I learned that each of the hotels of Peking had its own character and that the Qianmen ' s was one of the best . The restaurant served until midnight . The food often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried duck and delectable lamb hot pot. // The staff was earnest and eager . The elevator men asked questions about English grammar . The waitresses were coy and , by Chinese standards , flirtatious . In the restaurant , we used to parody Government slogans , calling out for some " revolutionary noodles . " Our jokes , which would have been faux pas of an extreme order in earlier years in China , usually brought laughter and spirited rejoinders from our friends who served us. // But there were also less pleasant aspects . Chinese people generally were not allowed in the hotel at all unless they showed their identity papers and registered with a secutity desk just inside the entry . Few were willing to register , knowing that their visit to the hotel would very likely be followed by a police interrogation. // Yet there were some who took the risk . One of my very rare visitors was a musician interested in American folk music , which I played for him on my mini tape cassette machine . He asked me , on my occasional visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American songs ( " Home on the Range " and " Goodnight , Irene " ) so that he could practice them and sing them for foreign audiences. // Then , one day , I got a telephone call from him ( he did not identify himself , but I recognized his voice ) , telling me to meet him in the alley . He came wearing a surgical mask over his mouth and nose , a common protection against Peking ' s dust , though in the case of my friend , it was against ready recognition by the security police he always imagined to be lurking close at hand . He told me he could not come to the hotel anymore . We set up more clandestine ways of meeting. // Still , even these cautious contacts with local people would have been impossible only a few years earlier when Mao Zedong was still alive . China was changing , and the Qianmen , situated in the midst of an old Chinese neighborhood , was a good point from which to witness the changes . A few streets away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found one of the early private entrepreneurs allowed by the authorities to create a business outside socialist planning . He was a tailor , originally from Manchuria , who , with his three sons , made suits and even a cashmere coat for me , his only foreign customer , in a cramped , dark room with an old potbellied stove and tables with sewing machines. // Behind the hotel was an antique- porcelain shop , not owned by the state but run collectively by a group of elderly men who had been antiques dealers before that activity was nationalized . They , too , had been allowed to go back into business , buying porcelain from local people , piling it in dusty corners of the shop until some foreigner with hard currency came to buy it. // I browsed there regularly , suspicious because Old Li , the collective member I always sought out , told me whenever I asked the identity of something that it was " Qianlong . " I assumed that Old Li took me for the kind of ignorant foreigner who believed you could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at more likely places like Sotheby ' s . Still the prices were very low , the porcelain nice , and I bought a few pieces anyway . Two years later when // I was preparing to leave China so I took my wares , as required by Chinese customs , to be examined by the experts at the Bureau of Cultural Relics for the necessary export permits . Every piece was indeed Qianlong , the experts said , with the result that I had to leave them behind since such items are treasures whose export is forbidden. // No doubt the tourist groups are today still being taken to the Qianmen , but a host of new , genuinely luxurious hotels have since been built in Peking . Now , when some traveler just returned from the country asks me where I lived when I was there , I know that he will never have heard of my hotel. // " A place called the Qianmen not far from the Temple of Heaven , " I say , thinking of my tailor , of " revolutionary noodles , " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these more recent travelers . They were born too late. // //
