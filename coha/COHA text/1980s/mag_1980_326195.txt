A Harvard guide to 106 ethnic groups in America <P> The inventor of Minute Rice , Ataullah K. Ozai-Durrani , was an immigrant who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan . <P> The city of St. Petersburg , Fla. , was named by Businessman and Railroad Builder Peter Demyanoff-Demens , who came from St. Petersburg , Russia . <P> One of the proudest family legends , remembered almost as an epic among America 's 12,000 Bosnian Muslims , is the digging of Chicago 's subway tunnels in the early 1900s . <P> Such facts and thousands more concerning the clans , tribes and nationalities that made their way to America have now been converted into highly readable scholarship . This week Harvard University Press is bringing out the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups , a 1,076-page volume that sells for $60 ( $45 until Jan. 1 ) . <P> The encyclopedia is filled with tales just like those grandfather used to tell . Says Editor and History Professor Stephan Thernstrom : " It 's a guide to who the people of the United States are , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we all need it . Nothing like it exists . " <P> The Harvard Press began research for the encyclopedia in 1974 , after one of its editors , Ann Orlov , was referred to a new dentist named Vangelzissi . What kind of name was that ? she asked . Albanian , the dentist replied . Orlov ( a Russian name ) was surprised . As she wondered just how many Albanian Americans were in the U.S. ( roughly 70,000 ) and where they lived ( mainly New England , New York City ) , the quest for an encyclopedia was born . Recalls Editor Thernstrom ( whose name is Swedish ) : " We started on the assumption that there were something on the order of 50 or 60 ethnic groups . We ended up with 106-and even that is a somewhat arbitrary figure . " Part of the problem was that nobody has an airtight definition of what an ethnic group is . Basic differences of national origin , race and language are clear enough . But sometimes groups are distinguished from one another by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homeland . As Sociologist Milton Gordon suggests , ethnicity may mean nothing more precise than " a sense of peoplehood . " <P> The encyclopedia includes such little-known ethnic groups as the Manx ( immigrants from the Isle of Man ) and the Wends , who migrated to Texas during the 19th century from what is now East Germany . Though the Wends are now dispersed , records of their migration survive in their language , known , naturally enough , as Wendish . The book 's separate listing for Macedonians is expected to upset both Greeks and Bulgarians because historically Macedonia was part of both southern Bulgaria and northern Greece , and both nationalities view Macedonians as their own . The scholar who wrote the four-page listing on Macedonians asked to remain anonymous to avoid recrimination.
