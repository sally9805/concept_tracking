The government 's curb on press coverage of clashes between police and black protesters may have stopped the flow of violent images from South Africa 's battered townships , but it has not stanched the flow of blood . While the average number of deaths each day dropped from 3.4 to fewer than two in the weeks immediately following Pretoria 's imposition of media restraints on Nov. 2 , the average daily toll last week rose above five . The statistic was a sharp challenge to the government 's contention that without television and camera crews present to incite publicity-hungry blacks to violent heroics , the disturbances would quiet down . As unrest flared in Queenstown and Mamelodi , two black areas that had been relatively calm , the protesters seemed to be indifferent to the absence of reporters . <P> The press restrictions have , however , created another side effect . With reporters mostly barred from entering the townships to cover the unrest , many have poured their energies into chasing down rumors . Word had it last week that Nelson Mandela , the imprisoned leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life sentence since 1964 , might soon be released and deported to Lusaka , Zambia , where the A.N.C . has its headquarters . The reports were fueled largely by the fact that the 67-year-old Mandela , who underwent prostate surgery four weeks ago , had not yet been returned from a hospital in Cape Town to his cell in Pollsmoor Prison . State President P.W . Botha tried to dispel the rumors , saying that " no decision has been taken " on Mandela 's future . At week 's end , authorities announced that Mandela had been returned to the prison outside Cape Town . <P> Equally sketchy were reports of what occurred when members of the U.S. Corporate Council on South Africa , an elite group of American business executives , met in London two weeks ago with their South African counterparts . While the participants , who included the chief executive officers of General Motors and Citibank , have kept a tight lid on the proceedings , it is assumed that strategies to hasten racial reform were discussed . Meanwhile another group , representing the 186 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices known as the Sullivan Principles , sent a telex to the South African government urging Botha to " lower tensions " in the schools of the country 's black townships .
