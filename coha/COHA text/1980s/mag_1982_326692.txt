There are few tales to be told about most of the men who rule the Soviet Union from splendid isolation in the Kremlin , but Yuri Andropov is a curious exception . As onetime Ambassador to Hungary , he has had more contact with foreigners than many of his comrades who have spent their careers at home . Now that he has stepped into the international limelight , scattered details and vignettes from his past have begun to emerge , adding both light and shadow to the Andropov portrait . <P> Retired Austrian Diplomat Walther Peinsipp became friendly with Andropov when both were serving as ambassadors in Budapest in 1956 . The first time they met , the two immediately became embroiled in an ideological debate . At one point , Andropov turned to Peinsipp and said : " Look , I am a Communist . You represent the opposite world view , but that does not prevent us from understanding each other on a human level . Every person must have convictions , and people without convictions do n't count . It would be beautifully simple if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but believe me , it would also be dull . " <P> During his time in the Budapest embassy , Andropov displayed a zest for the better things in life , many of them Western . French wine is said to have flowed freely , and salads were served punctiliously after the main course , Continental-style . Other comrades may have patriotically downed vodka , but Andropov apparently preferred to sip Johnnie Walker Scotch . Sndor Kopcsi , a former Budapest chief of police who now lives in Toronto , was frequently on the Soviet Ambassador 's guest list and recalls how Andropov used to borrow the police force 's gypsy band . With a clear tenor voice , Andropov would join in song fests . He was especially fond of a sentimental Hungarian ballad about a crane leaving its beloved mate to fly to foreign lands . <P> Bla Kirly , now a professor of history at Brooklyn College , saw another side of Andropov during the 1956 Hungarian uprising . On Nov. 2 , the day after Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy announced his government 's intention to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet embassy to check out a protest from Andropov that " Hungarian hooligans " had besieged the diplomatic compound . In the growing tension , the Nagy government feared that the Soviets might use any incident to send in troops . When Kirly arrived with a security unit to be sure the Soviet embassy was not being besieged , he found everything strangely quiet . He banged on the heavy oak door and was finally received by a tall , handsome man in tailor-made evening clothes . It was Ambassador Andropov . Standing behind him , as if on dress parade , was the entire embassy staff . Andropov brushed aside the protest as a misunderstanding and joked that the only Hungarian harassment that day had been from " two old ladies looking for a warm place to stay . " <P> Kirly , a commander of the Hungarian freedom fighters , was as tall as Andropov and could look him straight in the eye . He found Andropov 's stare mesmerizing and began to wonder whether he had " found the right man " to work out a deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Ambassador proposed that negotiations start the next day on Soviet troop withdrawals from Hungary .
