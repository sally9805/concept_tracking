When Secretary of State George Shultz phoned President Reagan from Moscow last week , he was forced to make his call from a special communications van flown over from the U.S. In the wake of the charges that Marine guards had allowed KGB agents into the embassy , his cables to Washington were dispatched through a communications system that had been elaborately reworked to safeguard their encryption . American security experts took exceptional pains to ensure that the Secretary 's sensitive communications were not intercepted by hidden Soviet listening and decoding devices . Although arms-control issues dominated the Secretary 's visit , the sex-for-secrets controversy continued to cast a shadow over U.S.-Soviet relations : on Ronald Reagan 's instructions , Shultz led off the negotiations with a complaint about espionage . <P> The Secretary also toured the still unfinished chancery at the site of the new U.S. embassy and later told Western and Soviet correspondents , " We now find we have a honeycomb of listening devices " in the building 's walls and structural columns . Investigators , however , have had only mixed success in locating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were apparently designed to serve as antennas . But after ripping into one wall with pneumatic drills in search of a suspicious object , workers found nothing more ominous than an empty beer can embedded in the concrete . <P> So far , more than 600 soldiers and civilian U.S. officials have been interrogated in a worldwide investigation of embassy security . Marine Commandant P.X. Kelley has endorsed an internal Corps memorandum suggesting that the Justice Department assist the Navy in its probe . The memo 's rationale is that American civilians will soon by implicated and that military investigators are overburdened by the scope of the scandal . Three Marine guards have been charged with espionage and one with fraternizing with Soviet women . Another Leatherneck suspected of spying has been recalled from his station in Brazil , where he was living with a Russian woman he met during a tour of duty at the Moscow embassy ; he is currently being held at the Marine base in Quantico , Va . As a result of such discoveries , the State Department has replaced five possibly tainted communications centers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the embassy was compromised twice by different Marine guards . The new units cost $5 million each . <P> The Navy last week was having difficulty preparing cases against Sergeant Clayton Lonetree and Corporal Arnold Bracy , the two Marines whose confessions triggered the scandal . The embassy guards have apparently repudiated or contradicted key sections of their initial statements , and much of the investigators ' case against them rests on hearsay evidence and polygraph tests . <P> After two days of a pretrial hearing at Quantico to determine whether Lonetree should undergo a court-martial , the defendant 's lawyers won a 3 1/2- week postponement of the proceedings . As Lonetree emerged from the courtroom , he grinned broadly and gave the thumbs-up sign , an indication that a plea bargain may be in the works . Lonetree 's chief attorney , William Kunstler , claimed the prosecution 's witnesses " said nothing that hurt our client . " Added Kunstler : " They have no direct evidence that ties or links him to any illegal activity . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
