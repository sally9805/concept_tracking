is almost sixty years since Oswald Garrison Villard , then editor of The Nation , sent Carleton Beals to Nicaragua . The assignment  --  travel to Jinotega , interview guerrilla leader  --  sounds almost commonplace today . But the mental landscape of the present needs to be stripped away . In February 1928 there were no contras , no sandalistas , no Inter-Continental Hotel , even  --  gracias a Dios  --  no Stephen Kinzer . In those days , for all its problems , Nicaragua was far from being the full-blown colony of the U.S. imagination that it is today . Back then a freelancer 's trip to Nicaragua was not as easy as it is now . Even with the 1985 embargo on the direct flight from Miami , it 's still just a hop and a skip  --  a plane to Mexico City , another from there to Managua  --  with the only real obstacle being the quirky Aeronica timetable . As compensation for the longueurs of the trip , the contemporary traveler can while away the time with many sorts of companions : Congressional aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fortune crowd , aspiring stringers for small-town papers . Back in 1928 there was almost no way to get there and nobody to string for . A new company called Pan American Airways had made the first ninety-mile crossing from Key West to Havana at the end of 1927 , but it did n't add its mail run through the Central American capitals until 1929 . You could n't even drive to Managua by the Pan American Highway : The Automobile Club of Southern California , which mapped the route , did n't begin to do so until 1930 , and even then only got as far as San Salvador . In the late 1920s , which were something of a boom period for travel writing and pop anthropology , a few adventurers did make it to Nicaragua . For some , it was a brief stopover on the steamer route to the Panama Car-% io which thousands of affluent tourists flocked to see the wonderful American victory over disease and the jungle . This meant a night or two in Corinto , a three-block town where the tiny foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . A second , bolder group of travelers took the slow train ( the only kind there was ) from Corinto , past the line of volcanoes , to Managua . Over cocktails at the American Minister 's residence , they might run into fellow wanderers like the man from Carpenter 's Guides , updating his chapter on Nicaragua and Honduras , or the indomitable , lantern-jawed British explorer F.A . Mitchell-Hedges , author of Battles With Giant Fish , on his way to uncover fresh Mayan ruins at the expense of the Hearst newspaper chain . The bravest of the party might head out to the smoking crater of the Masaya volcano to watch the green parakeets swooping in and out of the sulfurous updrafts  --  a trip that meant hacking one 's way across treacherous lava flows and dodging poisonous snakes ( no TurNica buses in those days to run the daily tourist shuttle ) . But most of the travelers ' tales of the day speak of Managua as a hell on earth : red dust half the year , red mud the remainder . Unlike San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chic metropolis , Managua was considered a diplomatic graveyard , like a posting to Ouagadougou . The interior was even more daunting . Getting there in 1928 was strictly by muleback ? unless you were a U.S. Marine , in which case you came in a Fokker trimotor bomber . Or unless you were Harold Denny of The New York Times , in which case you were ferried around by the Marines , those " obliging warriors against Sandino " as he called them . Denny had little time for the Nicaraguans , whom he described as " charming , but in many ways so futile . " The conflict with Sandino was , for Denny , a crude racial contest between order and chaos . The rebel troops , he wrote , were " men who could kill with ferocity unknown to any white soldier . " But what sport war could be ! The aerial bombing of Sandino 's base camp at El Chipote was " one of the most exciting day 's work since the Sandino operations started . " Plus ca change . Now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post , in need of a front-page story for the Arias plan deadline , slip into their Banana Republic gear , strap on their Tandy 200s and check in with the contras ' well-oiled propaganda outfit in Tegucigalpa . No problem : Today 's obliging warriors against the Sandinistas tell them to take their rented Toyota Landcruiser to Jinotega . There the reporter will be met by a contra honor guard for a two-day trek to show how the simple peasant folk love them . There 's just enough danger  --  clambering up vertical mud-slopes , dodging Sandinista patrols , risking the horrors of leishmaniasis , or at the very least an epic bout of dysentery  --  that when you get back to the bar at the Inter-Continental and order up a nica fibre ( " doble por favor ! " ) , you can look forward to the almost sexual frisson which accompanies the telling of a good story , secure in the knowledge that your paper still goes in first where others fear to tread Back in 1928 , Harold Denny , trading in the same blithe certainties as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on El Chipote had left Sandino dead , or at least gravely wounded . But on February 3 , at the end of a twelve-day ride from Honduras , Carleton Beals found him , alive and well , at San Rafael del Norte , ironically just a few miles from Hilquero and Guapinol , the datelines for those contras-kiss-babies stories in The Times and The Post on November 5 . The Sandino interview secured Beals 's reputation and entered the private mythology of The Nation , but it cost the author a lingering back injury , the result of being thrown from his horse . ( His fee from The Nation did not even cover the medical bills  --  plus ca change . . . ) The Sandino episode is also at the heart of John Britton 's book , though I wish Britton had taken the story a little further . One aspect of Beals that he has missed is the man 's intense self-awareness as a journalist and his equally severe criticism of his colleagues . The backdrop of the Sandino interview was an unpopular foreign war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise damage control in ways that are familiar today  --  with stage-managed press conferences , media events and photo opportunities . One example was the attempt to distract attention from the war in Nicaragua by having Charles Lindbergh make a " good-will " flight around the region between December 1927 and February = 1928 . Beals had a magisterial contempt for the pieties of F.D.R. 's later Good Neighbor policy , which talked about the United States ' southern neighbors as if they were all members of a kind of gigantic Rotary Club . He was equally disdainful of the journalists who fell for it . Beals 's iconoclasm went beyond the State Department . During the bitter polemics of the 1930s he also fell afoul of many fractious groups on the left . Britton devotes an interesting chapter to the events of 1937 , when Beals , a populist in the Debs tradition , agreed to join a committee of prominent intellectuals that sought to question Leon Trotsky , then in exile in Mexico , on the substance of Stalin 's charges against him . Beals was asked to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organizers ' liking . While the other questioners were eager to exonerate Trotsky and condemn the Moscow trials , Beals was set on establishing Trotsky 's bona fides , and often asked his witness hostile questions . For his pains , he was accused of just about every form of heresy . Isaac Deutscher called him a Stalinist ; Trotsky himself thought Beals was part of the monstrous G.P.U . conspiracy . Beals , who had been a well-informed and passionate antifascist since observing Mussolini 's rise to power in 1921 , now found himself contending with the same dogmatism from the left , the same obsessions with ideological purity , disease and contamination ( what Trotsky called " the elementary demands of political hygiene " ) . In the end , Beals 's involvement in the Trotsky episode left him bitter but amused by his own role as a straw man for others ' ideological disputes . " Everybody seems to have stuck up a dummy called Carleton Beals into which they have been plunging their verbal bayonets , " he wrote . " I wish them all success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those fierce and sterile debates about Stalin and the Soviet Union were followed by the first attempts by U.S. intellectuals to think about what would later be called the Third World in its own terms . Not that Beals was exactly a dependency theorist avant la lettre , but along with contemporary Latin Amencamsts like Frank Tannenbaum he tried to shift the frame of reference in ways that are striking when one thinks of the state of the academy at the time . The " advanced " position in official circles around 1930 was typified by men like Raymond Leslie Buell , research director of the Foreign Policy Association , whodeclared after a summer in Central America that old clich  --  s about the region 's instability were out-of-date , since , thanks to the U.S.-sponsored Nicaraguan elections of 1928 , it was now governed by " presidents at least tolerably acceptable to articulate opinion . " Buell thought this was no mean achievement , since " Central America is in the tropics and is inhabited by a population predominantly Indian . " Beals 's criterion was not whether the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington but whether they had anything to offer the " largely Indian " population . That was radical in the 1930s , and it 's radical today . I suspect that Beals would have felt at home with a phrase that is often used in Nicaragua today : " the logic of the majority . " Although Nicaragua is what he is best remembered for , and Mexico the country he probably knew best , my favorite among Beals 's books is The Crime of Cuba , which was published in 1933 . It works best because of the interplay between Beals 's prose and Walker Evans 's photographs , which set a new standard for the realistic depiction of Latin American life and departed radically from the stock images of the period : Latin America as alien terrain , a wilderness , alternately quaint and repellent , to be conquered by American ingenuity ; Havana as a winter playground during Prohibition . Evans 's images are both documentary and lyrical  --  a stevedore , a bread line , a pair of lottery ticket sellers . In blessed contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony about the limits of his profession . Two months after interviewing Sandino , he wrote to his father : I have no illusions and know that I am swimming against the current for the next two hundred years or so , but there is some zest even in that , and a convenient feeling of irony . About the only effects my warblings will have , as well as those of others similarly minded , I presume , will be to put the brakes on the mad process , so that it proceeds with more decorum . Beals died on June 26 , 1979 , while Anastasio Somoza was still bombing the Managua slums . The standard observation to make is that he should have lived three more weeks to see the Sandinistas enter Managua , and it is tempting to wonder where he would stand in the polemics of the 1980s . It 's easy to imagine him fulminating against the State Department . But I can also see him holed up on his Connecticut farm , with his cat Smokey , like some cranky political version of J.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would surely wish to lay claim to his legacy .

As Janice and Stephen MacKinnon write in their marvelous new book , " Her political commitment sprang basically from personal rage over the indignities she and her family had suffered in the mining towns of the West . " Freda Utley , a one-time Communist Party member who ultimately turned against Soviet Communism described Smedley as " one of the few spiritually great people I have ever met , with that burning sympathy for misery and wrongs of mankind which some of the saints and some of the revolutionaries possess .
