 | When Pablo Valdez arrived penniless in the 1980 Marie/ boatlift , Miami 's Cuban community helped get him a job at a Cuban-run real-estate firm . He sold $11 million in property that first year , ? now he employs Cubans at his two companies . Hien Nguyen had a Princeton degree , a $50,000 per year consulting job , a home overlooking the Potomac River ? and a longing for his fellow Vietnamese . So he moved to Bayou La Batre , a fishing town on Alabama 's Gulf Coast , pouring his life savings into what has become a $3 million wholesale shrimping concern . The firing of five fellow West Indians from the New York food service where they worked prompted Barry Forde , a former hotel worker from Barbados , to start his own catering company . Four years later , Unsurpassed employs 11 Caribbean islanders and expects 1988 revenues to top $10 million . The American dream is alive and flourishing . But for most of today 's immigrants , the trail to the top is vastly different . They are starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic networks are providing the bootstraps . For many , the combination is proving a fast track to success . Unlike previous settlers , mostly poorly educated refugees who found work as unskilled laborers , today 's " huddled masses " arrive with know-how ? and often cash . In 1911 , fewer than 2 percent of all entrants claimed to be technicians or managers , government tallies show ; by 1986 , the proportion had swelled to 32 percent . Those talents have enabled newcomers to leapfrog ahead faster than did their European predecessors . It took most Italians and Irish two generations to make the journey from worker to merchant ; now , entrepreneurial successes crop up on every street corner ? changing local consumer habits along with the neighborhood . Washingtonians enjoy injera bread at Ethiopian restaurants . Koreans , whose 11.9 percent self-employment rate is the highest among 17 recent immigrant groups and nearly double the U.S. average , have cornered Los Angeles 's wig and liquor businesses . And over 2,000 minimalls have sprung up in Southern California to accommodate ethnic vendors peddling such items as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark contrast between the old peasantstock sojourners and the new breed quick to exploit modern business methods , such as advertising . In Bayou La Batre , shrimper Nguyen may work long hours unloading the catch , but his consultant 's skills prove handy on overseas trips to secure fresh clients ; his Vietnamese wife , a computer scientist , keeps the books . Obstacle course . Not that the road up has been without bumps . In many cities , big business threatened to squeeze out the tiny shops ? only to get a run for its money from 24-hour groceries selling the freshest of fruits and beauty salons offering cut-rate manicures . By 1983 , Korean greengrocers were selling three quarters of New York 's produce , with the number of outlets multiplying from 30 in 1977 to 1,300 today . In Los Angeles , Hispanic firms have surged by 56.3 percent since 1982 ? prompting Safeway food stores to stock their shelves with Mexican products to lure back customers . Says Irving Light , co-author of an upcoming history of Korean entrepreneurs in Los Angeles : " Immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shun . Their stamina at times has galled locals shown up by the newcomers ' example . Some black communities , for instance , have boycotted Korean firms . A few leaders even suspected the South Korean government of subsidizing Koreans to take over ghetto stores and displace American workers ? a notion Seoul denies . Rather , experts say , immigrant enterprises prosper by filling niches vacated by earlier groups . " Entrepreneurship does not involve a  | new product , " argues City College sociologist Robert Waldinger . " It 's a matter of new people doing the same old things . " Indeed , Koreans have taken over groceries that languished as third-generation Italians moved into white-collar jobs . Asians and Hispanics have revived the sewing shops abandoned by Jews and Italians for the more profitable merchandising ends of the garment trade . And 3,000 Vietnamese shrimp boats have swarmed into the Gulf of Mexico , where a dearth of American fishermen had spawned short supplies . Says Waldinger : " Many industries would n't survive if there were no new immigrants . " While the businesses may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrive is not . Sacrifice remains a key to success . But it is the formidable web of alliances that gives fresh-off-theboaters their leg up . Unlike earlier community ties , which bound immigrants to their homeland and clan , modern networks are based on common interests , profession or educational background . Today 's Chinese immigrants , for example , have more than 200 such associations in addition to the traditional societies , and they can scout jobs or partnerships in newspapers that carry articles about subjects from tax guidelines to lease laws . Koreans bring together former school chums in lucrative business deals . Even the Korean Protestant Church is a prime place for business contacts , clientele and capital , with after-service " fellowship hours " for entrepreneurial brainstorming sessions . " The church 's main purpose is religious , " says the Rev. J. C. Park of Queens , N.Y. , " but we also help people find jobs . " One multibranch fundamentalist church also lends money with the proviso that recipients contribute some of their profits to the congregation . Friendly bankers . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an umbrella for New York 's 7,000 bodegas , or small stores . More important , ethnic enclaves offer everything from a first job to startup loans and business contacts . Firms can tap pools of cheap labor that are all but inaccessible to native-American employers ? beginning with the immigrant 's family and extending to friends , their children or any newcomer willing to swap hard work for a chance to learn business . Columbia University graduate Prakash T. Melwani , an Indian silk importer who immigrated to America in 1966 , parlayed skills learned at an uncle 's import business into a $50-milliona-year mail-order concern ; Royal Silk , Inc. , is now the world 's largest silk merchant . Says Melwani : " The network gave me confidence . " Many networks also provide start-up funds to ethnic entrepreneurs shunned by American banks . Dubbed susu in the patois of the Caribbean , kye in Korean , ekub in Ethiopian and hui in Mandarin , rotating-credit associations have proliferated ? despite the occasional upstart who runs off with the pot . As a rule , 10 members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then each takes his turn borrowing a lump sum . It takes up to 15 loans to buy a shrimp boat . Even immigrants in the mainstream economy sometimes tap the network for funds . Nilendu Srivastava , who emigrated from India in 1969 , financed his fledgling company , Micro Robotics , with two private offerings totaling $900,000 . More than 85 percent of his creditors came from the Indian community . He explains : " They had faith . " Bootstrapping enables ethnic groups to stake out specific trades and markets . New York 's Korean Produce Association , for instance , acts as an ethnic franchise operation . It matches new greengrocers with established Korean suppliers , distributors and contractors , then sets up a store in just weeks ? a key to the 97 percent success rate for such shops . It 's who you know . Still , a network 's ability to perform rests on people such as Los Angeles real-estate maven Sonia Suk , at one point president of 38 Korean associations . From her cluttered kitchen , the onetime kimchi ? pickled cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic Boulevard into a  | flourishing Koreatown by allowing fellow countrymen to borrow her commission as down payment on property . " They 're all millionaires now , " beams Suk . Despite such accomplishments , the American dream eludes teams of impoverished immigrants who arrive with neither expertise nor capital . Indochinese refugees , many of them uneducated farmers , suffer crippling disadvantages in business wars with better-capitalized Asian competitors . Hispanics face the same problem : They work an average of 11 years before saving enough to start a food store , compared with 18 months for Koreans , notes Pace University economist Philip Young . The success of Miami 's Cuban community ? mostly middle-class professionals who fled Havana in the early 1960s ? underscores the value of education , experience and even modest sums of capital ; in 1982 , sales of Cuban-owned businesses in Miami totaled $2.1 billion , $500 million more than Hispanic-owned businesses fetched in Los Angeles , though that population is five times larger . Notes Alejandro Portes , John Dewey Professor of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University : " Even so downtrodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without capital it 's difficult . " More challenging still is for immigrants to break away from their ghettos and into the mainstream . After an initial boost , ethnic enclaves can prove a trap . Increased competition forces merchants to undercut prices ? paring profit margins and wages to subsistence levels . In Orange County , Calif. , Vietnamese businesses have an 80 percent failure rate , for instance . And by clinging to their neighborhoods , shopkeepers neglect richer , more heavily trafficked city corners . " There are so many opportunities in America , but many immigrants stay in business ghettos , " says Le Xuan Khoa , head of the Indochina Resource Action Center . For most ethnic entrepreneurs , though , the real point of running a family business is family , not business . They toil to ensure their children college educations ? and solid careers as doctors and lawyers , not as salesclerks . Concludes Johns Hopkins 's Portes : " The true sign of an enclave 's success is its disappearance . " When Los Angeles police shot 21-year-old Hong Pyo Lee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful Koreans know but hate to discuss ? the strains of hard work are endangering the very thing for which they toil : The family . Lee 's parents put in 14-hour days to buy their son the white Audi he drove to his death . An impressive 43 percent of self-employed Koreans earn more than $50,000 . But divorce and household violence are on the rise and , reports a recent study by Queens College sociologist Pyong Gap Min , many Korean entrepreneurs are plagued by serious physical and mental-health problems . Men who enjoyed a middle-class status back home find themselves frustrated by the " downward social mobility " of running blue-collar service shops in America . Women , emboldened by managing the family firm , often assert their independence . Observes California State University sociologist Eui-Young Yu : " That 's upsetting the structure of the family since Korean men still want to be the boss . " Who 's minding the kids ? All immigrant groups find the transition to American life trying . Vietnamese , Chinese and Thai communities grapple with more-severe drug and gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing control of their kids . " When the parents leave for work , the children are sleeping and when they come home , the children are sleeping , " notes the Rev. J.C . Park from Queens , N.Y . " Their children are their biggest concern , but they do n't have time to take care of them . " Jae Nam Lee , a Manhattan greengrocer , is a case in point . He spends 16 hours a day , seven days a week , behind the cash register ; his wife puts in 12-hour days , leaving two young daughters with their grandmother . " We 're not like Americans , " says Lee . " We work for our children and our parents . " Their toil is often rewarded : Korean youths boast a disproportionately high enrollment at the nation 's elite colleges . But the flip side also exists . Struggling with language and a new environment , a self-proclaimed " 1.5 " generation ? neither wholly Korean nor wholly American ? sometimes falls in the cultural gap . " For every good student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " relates a New York University student whose parents both work 72 hours each week . " If you do n't get an A , you get an F ; there 's no middle ground . " Koreans are starting to apply their fabled networking skills to the domestic front . Churches , community centers and even trade associations have set up counseling services . And as in business , Koreans will probably emerge with a formula for how to succeed at home ? by really trying .
