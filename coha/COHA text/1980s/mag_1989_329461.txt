The natural superiority of baseball can be expressed in two electric words : pennant races . The daily games through September and the all-or-nothing arithmetic of a sport still unsullied by complex playoff pairings give baseball a dramatic structure without parallel . Last week , as the California Angels gamely struggled to overtake the Oakland A 's , Bert Blyleven , the bearded 38-year-old ace of the pitching staff , said , " This is what everybody plays for , to go into the last week of the season and have the games make a difference . " <P> Rarely have so many late-September games held the potential to make such an epic difference for so many teams . In all of baseball 's four divisions , the pennant races will not be officially decided until this week , the final seven days of the season . Only the San Francisco Giants , astride the National League West , possess breathing room ahead of the late-charging San Diego Padres . Powered by outfielder Kevin Mitchell ( 46 homers ) and first baseman Will Clark ( 109 RBIs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twosome since the Yankee era of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle . Small wonder that manager Roger Craig is chortling , " It 's going to be hard for anyone to catch us now . " <P> What lifts the September showdowns in the other three divisions onto an almost magical plane is the identities of the contending teams themselves . No celluloid Field of Dreams can compete with the real-life resurrections that are a recurrent theme of this year 's pennant sagas . In particular , four teams vying for the playoffs boast a distinct personality . Whoever prevails can be said to vindicate not only a theory of how the game should be played but , perhaps , for those who hail baseball as a religion , a philosophy of life as well . <P> The power of team chemistry . When the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East dropped 24 of their first 36 games this spring , it seemed the epitaph for a talented but erratic team . Renewal began with a new manager ( soft-spoken Cito Gaston ) whose unflappable style helped inspire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August acquisition of spark-plug centerfielder Mookie Wilson added on-the-field leadership . As Gaston , one of the two black managers in baseball , puts it , " If I was n't sitting in the dugout , I 'd buy a ticket to see Mookie play . " <P> The meek shall inherit the earth . In a rational universe , the Orioles ( losers of 107 games last year ) have no business nipping at the Blue Jays ' heels . Aside from their lone star , indestructible shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. , the O 's represent an amalgam of rookies and major-league rejects . A typical lineup includes six players who have been released or traded cheaply by other teams . Jeff Ballard , their junk-balling star pitcher , had a career record of 10-20 before this season . Cleanup hitter Mickey Tettleton never clubbed more than eleven homers in a year ; in ' 89 he already has 25 . As the O 's clubhouse T shirts ask , WHY NOT ?                  @ @ @
