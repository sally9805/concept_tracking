It looks as though it has fallen to my lot to settle the major issue of the 1988 presidential campaign I have been resisting this ever since the Republican convention , but even the redoubtable William Safire , in his " On Language " column in The New York Times , has failed us dismally Or perhaps The Times could n't bring itself to break the story 1 doubt if the preppie Bush knows what he 's been saying all these months , but I would be curious to know the background of the speechwriter who gave it to him You see , I grew up in the South Bronx about a thousand years ago , and the phrase was , unfortunately , only too common there When someone really wanted to put you down in those days , he would ? uh  --  pass wind and say contemptuously , " Read my lips " I feel confident that The Nation is the true publication of record and will not let this bit of political arcana slip through the cracks of history Stan Lee NO BOLL WEEVIL Chico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nov 28 and would hke to add my own .

That mistake made , did n't the editors notice the blatant partisanship of the piece once it was delivered ? all puff for the new , glorious leadership , all brickbats for the Old Guard ? In fact , Claiborne makes no pretense that any firsthand reporting went into the piece , he interviewed none of us , or anyone else who might be expected to differ with his idiosyncratic interpretation of the union 's early years And that is unfortunate He has got some of the basic facts wrong , perhaps because he was n't a delegate at the union 's founding convention The 1983 event was in Brooklyn , not Princeton , New Jersey The union had a healthy 1,000 members , according to Internal N W U documents , not 300 , as Claiborne Imagines ( and thirty , not twenty , official delegates , plus dozens of alternates and observers from ten cities ) More important , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mother Jones Claiborne aims his most ungracious criticism at Andrea Eagan , our first president  --  a charismatic speaker , he allows , but unable to translate ideas into organizational reality In fact , the union 's early leadership not only elaborated the organizational procedures still used by the union but also presided over the winning of all but one of the union 's contracts and agreements with publishers By the time Eagan left office in end-1987 , membership had grown to 2,234 , according to a recent secretary treasurer 's report . Current membership is 2,600 It is not our purpose to compare our achievements with those of the present leaders We wish them well The union has continued to grow in membership , and the union reniains a strong collective voice for the redress of writers ' grievances But the Internal disagreements of the past several years , which led to Eagan 's defeat a year ago , can not be so easily dismissed , as Claiborne does , as personality conflicts involving Eagan 's " style " of leadership The real issues of the 1987 election remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N W U should focus its energies on its original constituency of book writers and freelance journalists , we advocate a recruitment strategy to solidify the union 's place in the publishing main-stream Several years ago , we and other union book writers elaborated the union 's planned campaigr to win improvements in book con-tracts , bat the supporters of the current ( ( untamed on Page 734 ) somethin . he was goin to do the beatin .

( Continued From Page 706 ) leadership delayed it In our opinion , the current leadership 's organizational approach , emphasizing endless surveys and local consultation , is a mask for timidity and indecision This dissipation of union energies is at least partly due , we feel , to the influence of the N W U executive director , who has said she sees the future " paying base " of the union as so-called commercial/practical/ technical writers , i e. , those other than Journalists and book writers . Such disagreements over strategy are not surprising or unsavory in a young union . They are the stuff elections should be fought over Claiborne trivializes the union 's internal vitality by omitting the terms of the controversy .

Brooklyn I 've been called some pretty horrible things in my time ? from " Stalinist " to " liberal " ? but Robert Claiborne has managed the ultimate insult . He called me an EDITOR ! ! ! I AM NOT NOW , NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN , AN EDITOR I am a WRITER ( In the interest of full disclosure , I am " series editor " for the National Women 's Health Network/Pantheon book series ? a cross between baseball scout and political commissar No one who knows anything about publishing would confuse that with " editor " ! ) In the interest of my reputation , I demand a retraction of this slanderous affront .

But if my use of it distressed Eagan , I 'm sorry . As for the letter from Dinges et al. , the first thing that must be said is that it is at least disingenuous . Its talk of " blatant partisanship , " " puff for the new , glorious leadership " and so on clearly implies that I am a longtime buddy of Eagan 's opponents who is pursuing a partisan feud In fact , as several of the signers know very well , my " partisanship " in the 1987 election was on Eagan 's side I was one of the minority of delegates that publicly backed her , and also gave money to her campaign ; any suggestion to the contrary is disinformation The article expressed my personal views , which are n't necessarily those of the union 's present leaders ? some of whom , in fact , questioned whether I ought to publish it . After the election I chose to work with the new leadership , because my commitment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any individual heading it The alternative was to pick up my marbles and go home  --  as some of the letter 's signers have done . The matter of the union 's precise early membership is too peripheral to waste space over , beyond noting that I got the figures from what I considered reliable sources ? including , as I recall , Dinges himself As for my criticism of the union 's " organizational procedures , " we 're clearly talking about two different things The original leadership indeed did a first-class Job of setting up a formal organizational structure ; where it fell short ? through inexperience ? was in informal organizational know-how , shown by what I called sketchy planning , blurred lines of authority and loose follow-up on decisions These criticisms were based on my personal observation of the union 's operations on both the national and local levels ? and my own fifty-odd years of organizational experience I first voiced them months before the 1987 election ; I also wrote Dinges at the time that I felt they applied to the entire national leadership  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter itself supplies a neat example of the sketchy planning I was talking about , when it criticizes the union 's current book campaign for " endless local consultation " In fact , the consultations have centered on setting up book-organizing committees at the local level These were utterly essential for implementing the national campaign , yet were not even mentioned in the original organizing plan They were also mandated at the 1987 convention by unanimous vote of the delegates ? including several of the letter 's signers The letter claims that the " real issue " in the 1987 election was the need to focus union organizing on its " original constituency of book writers and freelance journalists . " I 'd call this a non-issue , since that 's precisely what we 've been doing since the election Most of our very modest organizing resources have gone into the Village Voice campaign ( freelance Journalists ) and the national book campaign ( book writers ) Finally , the charge of " timidity and indecision " in the book campaign presumably applies to ( among others ) me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , I 've been called a lot of horrible things in my time , but not " indecisive " ? and certainly not " timid " ! I and my colleagues in the campaign have been making all the haste we can , in the only way we can slowly Now , if we had a few tens of thousands in organizing funds Robert Claiborne RANGE WARS Tucson , Ariz Having both lived in rural areas and been concerned about public lands ranching for many years , I strongly disagree with Wilbur Wood 's " Holistic Cowboys on the Range " in the September 19 issue Wood 's article , rife with misinformation , reads like an advertisement for the grazing industry rather than an accurate portrayal of public lands ranching Wood starts out by scoffing at Bob Scott 's Big Open proposal to transform a large portion of east-central Montana from fenced , overgrazed cattle country into a huge , unfenced game ranch and nature reserve Despite Wood 's immature , sarcastic remarks , Scott 's proposal to remove livestock and reintroduce native animals for commercial use is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defends the poor ol ' dusty public lands rancher ( Actually , many , if not most , are wealthy and powerful ) Wood says the fee for grazing public lands went up 14 percent this year He does n't say this was the first fee increase in seven years and does n't even begin to keep up with inflation . Or that the fee is still only about one-fifth what public forage is worth  --  the $4 to $14 per " animal unit month " ranchers should be paying . Who but a public lands rancher could feed a cow for only $1 54 a month ? Wood does n't seem to know his ecology or understand the environment Thousands of times over the years , it has been shown conclusively that removing livestock from the land results in vast permanent improvement in vegetation , watersheds , soil and water quality and animal habitat , and that non-grazing almost invariably results in much greater environmental improvement than Allan Savory 's " holistic resource management " style grazing Wood further states that wildlife benefits from public lands ranchers ' private hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the government , by the way ) . In reality , a lot more wildlife is shot by ranchers and harmed by the detrimental effects of their livestock than is helped by the small amount of private hay they eat Maybe if the rangelands were n't so thoroughly stripped of forage , wildlife would n't be forced to raid private hay in the first place . Stock tanks likewise do more damage than good to wild animals because they allow overgrazing in areas otherwise too dry for stock ( though not for wildlife , which ranges much farther from water and uses less ) . Again , maybe if livestock had n't destroyed so many natural water sources , many tanks would n't have been built in the first place As Wood says , there are no " bad " guys or " good " guys in this issue I think most of us agree . Nevertheless , there are 23,000 ranchers spending tax money and degrading our public lands . Wood twists things around to obscure the true issue  --  welfare ranching and degradation of public lands Diversionary tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public lands , " small towns will die , " and it may even be " a form of genocide " This is totally absurd ' Very few counties in the West derive more than 5 percent of their economic base from livestock grazing , public and private , even where 95 percent or more of their area is grazed Most ranchers would not go out of business , anyway , if their cattle and sheep were removed from public lands Wood 's statement that the land " needs people living on it day after day , not just admiring it on weekend outings " is even more ridiculous The land did quite well without people for 4 billion years Will the environment somehow fall apart without ranchers watching over it ? Ranchers have done more damage to the West than any other land user , so why should we let them watch over it , anyway ? And regardless of Wood 's comment about weekend admirers , many stoppublic-lands-grazing advocates do live out on the land in rural areas Of course , due to social and political pressures and threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile I think Wood would be surpnsed to learn Just how little support public lands ranchers actually have in rural areas As for Allan Savory and his H R M , there is not nearly enough room here to present the true story But let me say I have attended a Savory seminar and workshop , read numerous articles on H R M. , visited allotments where it is being practiced , talked to those practicing it and corresponded with Savory himself In all the West , there is no solid evidence that H R M results in significantly improved environmental quality , much less the grandiose improvements advertised by Savory Those limited " successes " there have been under H R M can be attributed more to greater outputs of energy , money , materials and Just plain common sense than to any great scientific or managerial breakthrough Both economically and philosophically , Allan Savory has been prostituting science , and it 's high time we called him on it Savory is a range consultant , and more than 90 percent of his clients are ranchers who want one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse on ecology , livestock remains his overwhelming priority Indeed , ecological manipulation is merely his means to that end It is becoming evident that Allan Savory would rather experiment on our public lands with his H R.M and livestock than support the one simple measure which would virtually guarantee much greater improvement in environmental quality  --  removal of livestock Lynn Jacobs WOOD REPLIES Roundup , Mont Removal of livestock does not guarantee that semiarid grasslands , public and private , in western North America will stop turning to desert Rest ? from grazing , from animal impact , from fire , from plow and ax Is a tool . One of nature 's tools . And ( because for better or worse we are stewards ) one of humanity 's tools Rest is not doing nothing It is doing something .
