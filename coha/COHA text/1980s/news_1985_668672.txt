A crowd of hungry dinner guests surrounds a pot simmering over a wood fire . As kerosene is poured over the fire , flames shoot up to singe a tree overhead , and water spews over the pot ' s brim . The crowd loves it . The shooting flames are not just spectacle . They create the " boilover , " the heart of a true Door County , Wis. , fish boil . But this is not Door County , it ' s a North Side back yard . Hostess Danielle Hayner removes flaky chunks of salmon , whitefish and lake trout from the pot and declares the boilover a success . " Some people think all the shooting flames are just a kind of gimmick , but I think they are really what makes the fish come out so moist and flaky , " she says . Chicagoans , such as Hayner , who have vacationed on the Door County peninsula , have discovered they don ' t have to travel 300 miles to enjoy a fish boil  --  the pride of quaint inns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil can be done in most back yards . The basic recipe is simple : New potatoes and chunks of fish are cooked in a pot full of salty water that boils over a wood fire . The fish and potatoes then are bathed with melted butter . Fresh bread , coleslaw and beer are served . Cherry pie is the traditional dessert . The most essential ingredient , Hayner says , is to have a " master boiler , " someone who can build a wood fire , tend to the fish and potatoes while they boil away , then throw a cupful of kerosene at the flames to perform the boilover . Hayner ' s master boiler this night is Tom Berenz , a Highland Park resident who has been doing fish boils in his back yard for years . As he stands over the fire stirring the potatoes , he talks about the essential ingredients . " Wood should be used for the fire because of the intense heat it creates . Then , you just keep it at a nice rolling boil , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quips , " You need lots of cool beer at the ready . " Berenz does fish boils in almost any weather . He recalls a cold wintery day when he had to dig a place in the snow to build the wood fire . The guests watched from the warmth of his house and ran out only for the boilover . Like Hayner , Berenz insists the boilover is responsible for the final product  --  moist fish that flakes away from the bone . Any grease or oily residue is just boiled over , he explains . " It gives it a nonfishy taste , " says Hayner . " That ' s why even people who don ' t like fish like fish boils . I ' ve seen people eat three plates of the stuff . " Berenz adds two 26-ounce containers of salt to about 10 gallons of water . Onions sometimes are cooked along with the new potatoes , which Berenz removes before boiling the fish . He cooks the fish in a wire mesh net that prevents the chunks of fish from separating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to have been started in the 1800s by the the first Scandinavian settlers on Door County shores . Fish boils at some Door County inns have become so popular that tickets are sold out long in advance . While Hayner ' s 50 guests wait for their fish , they nibble hors d ' ouevres and sip gazpacho soup . None of them , even the die-hard New Englander brought up on clam bakes , has any trouble cleaning up 50 pounds of fish .
