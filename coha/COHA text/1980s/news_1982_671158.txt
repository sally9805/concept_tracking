Unlike wood , plaster , gypsum board and similar building materials , unprotected metal corrodes or oxidizes when exposed to air and moisture . This oxidation may or may not be objectionable - in appearance as well as in its effect on the metal - but it does pose special problems when painting. // On ferrous metals ( iron or steel ) oxidation or corrosion takes the form of rust , a reddish-brown rough coating that actually eats away and eventually destroys the metal . On aluminum , oxidation takes the form of a white , sometimes powdery film that is often accompanied by pitting . On copper , it takes the form of a greenish film ; on brass and bronze it is black or dark gray , often with a greenish tinge. // Protecting the metal against oxidation and corrosion is one of the most frequent reasons for painting . Although the procedures for painting all metals are , to some extent , quite similar , there are differences in the type of primer that should be used and in the preparatory steps that should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals that are most commonly encountered around the home : // Iron and steel . Since rust is a very poor base for paint , and since rust is almost always a serious problem with iron and steel , it is essential that steps be taken to remove or treat any rust that is already present , in addition to using a metal primer that is specifically formulated to protect against rusting. // If the metal has never been painted before and is relatively clean , use steel wool or abrasive paper to remove any rust spots that are visible , rubbing until the metal is bright . Then clean the metal thoroughly to remove grease , dirt or wax by washing with a detergent solution , or by wiping down with a rag moistened with paint thinner or similar grease solvent . When dry , apply a uniform heavy coat of a good quality metal primer , such as one containing red lead or zinc chromate in either an oil-base or latex-base formulation. // Be sure you paint all of the edges , including the back and other parts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture from any bare metal to prevent rust . Rust will soon spread to other areas , creeping under any paint that has been applied and gradually causing it to lift. // If the metal is already rusty , start by scraping off as much loose rust as you can , using wire brushes and coarse steel wool . Then clean the surface thoroughly by wiping down with solvent as described above. // Any rust that remains must then be treated so it will not continue to spread and so it will provide a solid base for painting . There are two methods you can use. // In one , you can apply one of the special rust-inhibitive metal primers that are formulated for use over existing rust . These are metal primers that have a red lead or zinc chromate base , and they are designed to penetrate most rust in order to create a better bond. // Or you can treat the rust with one of the new chemical rust " converters . " When these are brushed on over existing rust they actually convert it into a stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are at least two brands on the market , Trustan 7 and Duro Extend . While not identical in formulation or in application procedures , both react chemically with rust to create a solid film that is firmly bonded to the metal. // Some prefer to use one of the rust converters first and then a suitable metal primer . Previously painted iron and steel are painted just as any other previously painted surface , except that all bare spots or rusted spots should be touched up first . This means following the directions for rusted metal on the bare spots , then giving these touched-up areas a preliminary coat of the finish paint before going ahead with the whole job. // Galvanized metals . These have a zinc plating that often creates special problems when painted . Such metals are very prone to peeling if not properly cleaned and primed . If the metal is new , it must be thoroughly cleaned first by washing with a strong detergent or a grease solvent ( the manufacturing process leaves a slight film that will keep paint from bonding properly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good for treating galvanized metal prior to painting. // After cleaning , apply a coat of metal primer made for galvanized metal ( it should say so on the label ) . These primers usually have a lot of zinc dust oxide in them , and many of the newest ones are latex-based . Again , be sure you cover all surfaces carefully with the primer , leaving no bare metal exposed . Allow the primer to dry completely before applying any finish coats. // Aluminum . When aluminum oxidizes , a coating is formed that is not at all harmful to the metal - in fact , it actually prevents further oxidation . However , the white film that results may look unsightly. // Before painting , the first step is removing the loose or powdery part of this oxidation . Scrub with a strong detergent solution , using fine steel wool as an abrasive pad . Then prime with a zinc chromate metal primer or with one of the latex-base metal primers that are suitable for use on aluminum ( check the label ) . Do not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted ( aluminum siding , for example ) clean the surface thoroughly , and then paint with a latex-base enamel or exterior house paint , preferably one that is formulated for use on aluminum. // Copper or brass . If the metal has not been painted before , then it is most likely covered with a greenish oxidation film if it is copper or bronze , and a blackish or dark gray film if it is brass . This film should be removed - or at least as much as will come off without excessive abrasion - before any paint is applied. // To clean the metal use fine steel wool and detergent , or use one of the all-purpose metal polishes that contain a mild abrasive . If you use a polish , wash off the residue after you are done . After cleaning , use a zinc chromate metal primer. //
