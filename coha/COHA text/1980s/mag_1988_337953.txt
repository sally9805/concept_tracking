One day in 1943 TIME Managing Editor T.S . Matthews inspected the young fellow - from Seattle who had just been hired as a writer . " Oh , you 're a Tom ? " he said , catching the man 's name on the application form . " Sorry , I 'm Tom around here . You 're Griff . " <P> So Griff it has been for much of Thomas Griffith 's 45 years in the corridors of Time Inc . For the past twelve years he has been turning out TIME 's Newswatch column . Readers who have come to know and respect the column 's level-headed analyses of the press and its foibles will not be surprised to learn that the reader comes first in Griffith 's mind . " I never considered it my role to defend the press , " he says . " I start with the reader 's curiosity and concern about the information he 's getting . Sometimes this means explaining what the press does , sometimes deploring it . " <P> In the decades between his initial job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Griffith held virtually every editing position at TIME , earning praise as a friendly , unflappable manager at each turn . He also served as the editor of LIFE , a contributing writer for FORTUNE and the senior staff editor of all Time Inc. magazines . Along the way he took time to write two books , The Waist-High Culture ( 1959 ) and How True : A Skeptic 's Guide to Believing the News ( 1974 ) . <P> This week 's Newswatch column will be the last . At 72 , Griff thinks he has had his say about the press . Though the column will retire with him , readers need not despair . Griffith promises to deliver occasional essays to our doorstep , a form at which he has excelled , and he is already hard at work on a book that deals with inequality in America . Any parting words of wisdom after a dozen years as TIME media watcher ? " Oh , " says Griff , characteristically , " I do n't think that way . " <P> In this issue is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will offer brief reviews of outstanding books , movies , records , concerts and plays , as well as a short list of notable television programs . The section , which will appear on alternate weeks , is written by and reflects the collective intelligence of TIME 's cultural critics .
