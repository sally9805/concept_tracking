The day after Michael Dukakis picked his running mate , George Bush invited TIME 's Hugh Sidey to his White House office for a conversation . Excerpts : <P> Q. Did Bentsen 's selection surprise you ? <P> A. Yes , it surprised me . It has been very well received . And it should be . It is a tribute to Bentsen . But , you see , I 'm not running against Lloyd Bentsen . I 'm running against Michael Dukakis , in Texas and everywhere else . How Bentsen and Dukakis get together on these issues where they are diametrically opposed , I do n't know . Remember voodoo economics ? Every place I went ( ( in 1980 ) ) people were saying , hey , explain these differences between you and Reagan . Dukakis and Bentsen have a litany of differences . You can just walk through them , whether it 's MX missile , support for the contras , support for the Reagan tax cut , gun control in the Southwest  --  imagine trying to defend a person who strongly favors federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to do that in Texas . <P> Q. Are you going to choose your vice-presidential candidate before the convention ? <P> A. If I do , I probably will not tell a soul before the convention , including Barbara Bush . . . I have not really begun to contemplate running mates yet . <P> Q. Will the campaign become bitter , personal ? <P> A. Not as far as I am concerned . It is going to be tough . Dukakis . . . has never been exposed to this level of American politics . And it is my thesis that therefore he has never been tested . Every little frailty is in focus . I 've been there . I feel quite relaxed about it . ( ( But ) ) Dukakis is not prepared for what he is going to get into . <P> Q. What is your plan ? <P> A. ( ( To ) ) put into focus where I differ from Michael Dukakis . He is a traditional , very liberal Democrat . And I quote him on that , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U. " <P> A tremendous difference is going to be on the national security of this country , how to deal with the major world problems and who best to sit across * the table from Gorbachev or a wide array of other leaders , who best to lead the alliance , who has enough confidence and experience to chart a course for the future . My case to the American people is , that 's me . I 'd be better at this than Michael Dukakis . <P> Q. What do you think his strengths are ? <P> A. Persistence , doggedness . Quite smart , quite bright , quite convinced he is right . So when he takes what I would call a very liberal position in American politics , I think he is doing it from conviction . I do n't think he is doing it because he is trying to get ahead in the campaign .
