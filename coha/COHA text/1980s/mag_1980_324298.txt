Newswatch <P> It 's almost impossible to find any Washington columnist who is really for Jimmy Carter . Down in Carter 's Georgia , Hal Gulliver , editor of the Atlanta Constitution , suspects that columnists like David Broder and Joe Kraft wake up mornings feeling fine for 30 seconds until they remember who is President , and then their day is ruined . Gulliver puts it down to anti-Southern prejudice , but of course that 's just a rebel yell , not a sensible argument . <P> The sympathy that many columnists once felt for Carter has turned in some cases to active dislike , in others to acute disappointment . As Anthony Lewis says , " Those of us who admired Jimmy Carter from the start are in a quandary now . He is a highly intelligent man , with good values , but somehow . . . " On Martin Agronsky 's Washington TV show , Columnist Carl Rowan often seems to be defending Carter , but he insists he is simply giving the President a fair shake against " ridiculous criticism . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his promise of more jobs , says Rowan , only to find black unemployment now worse : " Carter turned out to be not a populist but a smalltown businessman . " But after surveying the presidential field , Rowan concludes , " I 'm not supporting any of these turkeys . " <P> Columnist Jack Anderson , who specializes in unearthing governmental misdeeds , grades the Carter Administration " a little below normal-less corrupt than Nixon , of course , but more corrupt than Ford , L.B. J. or J.F.K. Perhaps Carter does n't know any better , maybe it 's the way they play politics in Georgia . " From the outset Joe Kraft has been unimpressed with Carter , regarding him as an " unstructured mind " incapable of consistent policymaking . In Kraft 's view , Carter lacks a political base , which he makes up for by assembling 7% of this group , 14% of another-a " remainder candidate , " driven to cutting back and forth to make his majority . But , sighs Kraft , " he 'll probably win again . " Rowland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , " We 're not for anybody , but you do n't have to be highly perceptive to know we 're not crazy about Carter . " <P> In former days , any President had to assume some partisanly hostile reporting . But he could also count on writers who out of conviction or self-interest hastened to defend him and could be rewarded with inside tips or White House favors . For a variety of reasons , there 's much less of that kind of exchange these days . The interesting phenomenon is that Washington commentators sympathetic to Carter became disillusioned with him before much of the rest of the country did . Was this a case of claustrophobic Potomac groupthink or of closer knowledge ? Some of both . Reporters recognized Carter 's genuine concern about the Iranian hostages but disliked the way he used the situation to his political advantage . The liberal Mary McGrory also thinks that reporters spotted a mean streak in Carter long before the public read what she calls his " tacky and unseemly " remarks about Cyrus Vance following Vance 's resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
