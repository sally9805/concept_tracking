DALLAS  --  LTV Corp. , in an attempt to relieve its apparent cash crunch , is trying to divest all or part of its energy operations . The unit , one of the nation ' s largest makers and suppliers of oil field equipment , contributed slightly more than 9% of LTV ' s 1984 sales of $7. 05 billion . However , the unit has had losses and , given the current energy slump , the entire operation probably wouldn ' t fetch more than $400 million , analysts and competitors said . In the first half of this year , LTV reported an operating loss of about $229 million . An LTV spokesman said that in recent weeks , the company has " held discussions with potential buyers " of four stand-alone divisions of the subsidiary , LTV Energy Products Co . The spokesman said the possible divestiture of these divisions is part of a previously stated goal of generating $500 million by late next year by selling some units and finding joint venture partners for others . Individuals familiar with the unit said that LTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off pieces of the energy subsidiary . Individuals familiar with LTV and its operations said company officials have indicated internally that they would like to leave the energy business altogether by late next year . The LTV spokesman , Charles Palmer , wouldn ' t comment on that , saying : " It may or may not happen . There are so many maybes . " The energy unit , formerly known as Continental Emsco Co. , had 1984 sales of $647 million . In 1981 , before the energy slump began , the subsidiary had sales of $2. 1 billion . LTV Energy has been unprofitable for the past 2 1/2 years . In 1984 , it had an operating loss of $73. 1 million ; in this year ' s first half it had an operating loss of $25. 3 million . In last year ' s fourth quarter , LTV took a $50 million write-down in connection with a restructuring of its energy operations . In this year ' s second quarter , the parent company wrote down an additional $20 million related to inventories and receivables of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far has discussed the sale of the following divisions : Fibercast , which makes fiber glass pipe ; Automatic Fluid Systems , which makes oil production equipment ; Oil States Industries , which makes rubber and plastic products for the oil and gas industry ; and Tubular Services , which does oil pipe threading . Mr. Palmer wouldn ' t say whom the company had talked with . He said the four divisions accounted for " far less than half " of LTV Energy ' s total sales . The company is facing stiff competition from other sellers pounded by the energy slump . Because of the subsidiary ' s size , LTV is attempting to sell it " piece by piece , " said one source , and would even accept joint venture partners for parts of it . If LTV were to divest the subsidiary all at once , " they could maybe get $300 million to $400 million , " said Scott Nedrow , an analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. in New York . " Much of what they manufacture is rig parts and there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " LTV has , over the past few years , shrunk its energy products unit . It has closed two of its manufacturing facilities , and late last year put a third one up for sale . When the company announced its plan to sell assets in May , it wouldn ' t identify which ones it might put on the block . It only said it wouldn ' t sell any parts of its aerospace-defense subsidiary , the only one of its three subsidiaries that is profitable . The only operation LTV previously identified as a candidate for sale is its LTV Steel Specialty Products Co . When it announced the sale of that unit in July , analysts and industry observers said the specialty-steel unit was offered for sale because it represented the most salable piece of the deeply troubled LTV Steel Co. unit , which is the nation ' s No. 2 steelmaker.  --  - LTV Extends Swap Offers DALLAS  --  LTV Corp. extended to Oct. 21 its exchange offers for three debt issues totaling $323. 4 million and sweetened its offer for one of the issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
