Howard Hughes died batty and beset by phantoms , and all of us learned valuable lessons from his downfall : do not let your fingernails grow to excess , do not inherit too much money , do not fly too high . The man 's decay was so pathetic and so gaudy that it is difficult now even for those with a good grip on middle age to remember that once he was a hero . A strange hero , certainly , but a real one ; a test pilot of impressive courage and a gifted , self-taught aircraft designer at a time when aviation was the century 's brightest adventure . In 1935 he set the world landplane speed record ( 352 m.p.h. ) in an aircraft of his own design . Small boys wanted to be Howard Hughes , never mind the money and never mind Jane Russell . <P> The visitor knows this . Still , the Spruce Goose is a surprise . The mind is ready for a ponderous bad joke . The funny name suggests this . So does the knowledge that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , with its 320-ft. wingspan ( it is the largest plane ever built ) , behind security so tight that some of his hangar maintenance men never got to see the aircraft . The big hangar itself , a cantilevered , air-conditioned marvel on Terminal Island at Long Beach , Calif. , is being demolished now , sold off by what is left of Hughes ' Summa Corp . The Goose , moved by tugboat last fall to a site a quarter mile away , has a temporary home in a circus tent . A reporter enters the tent prepared to see a dead whale on a flatcar . <P> The astonishing news is that the Goose lives . The observer 's first impressions are not just of size , but of trimness , tightness and fine lines . This is no " flying lumberyard , " as the plane was derisively called during World War II when it was under construction as the prototype for what was to be a fleet of air-freighters . The Goose is an airship , dry-docked for the moment . The sum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly . Given a few weeks for testing and tuning up , it could still fly . <P> " We hot-oiled the engines every six months , " says Systems Engineer Stan Soderberg , 55 , who has spent his adult life caring for the big plane . A parachute rigger fresh out of the Navy , he signed on with Hughes at 21 , in 1946 . " We ran the controls every other week , hydraulics one week and electrical the next . " Soderberg is a lean , intense fellow who wears an airman 's jumpsuit . He saw the plane 's only flight , on Nov. 2 , 1947 , when Hughes lifted it off the water of Long Beach Harbor and flew it at a height of 70 ft. for about a mile . Hughes had announced he would only undertake taxiing tests , but Soderberg says he knew that Hughes ' preparations had been too elaborate for mere taxiing . " When I saw that flap come down at 15 I told a photographer next to me , ' You 'd better get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat I 've ever seen . " <P> And now ? Soderberg points up at the FAA registration number painted in huge characters on the wing . " There 's no X there , for experimental . Hughes had it taken off . It 's a registered airplane . It flies . "
