You earn $60 million in your first four weeks , and everybody has an explanation for your success . As the surprise movie hit of the fall season , Tri-Star 's baby-love comedy Look Who 's Talking has inspired plenty of retrospective wisdom . It came out at the right time of year , when its only competition was heavy dramas . It hits yuppie moviegoers where they live : in the narrow margin between careers and parenthood . It carries echoes of When Harry Met Sally in the loving friendship of a thirtysomething mom ( Kirstie Alley ) and the cabdriver ( John Travolta ) who moonlights as baby-sitter . It has Hollywood 's favorite premise , the fish out of water  --  or , here , fetus out of womb . For the main character is a talking baby , in the worldly wise-guy voice of TV and movie star Bruce Willis . <P> A month ago , though , few people were predicting a smash . The movie 's star , Kirstie Alley of TV 's Cheers , was an unproven marquee draw . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past their luster . Critics mostly dumped on the picture or ignored it . Savants figured , in fact , that it had about as much chance of being a hit as , say , a single sperm has of fertilizing an egg . <P> They forgot about Mikey , the embryo ( and then infant ) with star quality . Sassy but never cynical , Mikey is first seen , through some cunningly simple special effects , as a kind of hot-rodding sperm cruising up the Fallopian tube to the tune of the Beach Boys ' I Get Around . " The sperm comes on and people go crazy , " says Jonathan Krane , the film 's producer . " From then on they 're laughing at the picture . " Not quite . They 're laughing with it , in the easy , conspiratorial laughter any domestic comedy would kill to get . <P> Moviegoers love babies , of course . A lame comedy like 3 Men and a Baby earned $168 million by offering little more than Tom Selleck diapering a child . The talking baby is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The First Time ( 1952 ) and a 1960 sitcom called Happy . Spermatozoa have schmoozed ( Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex ) , and in this year 's Me and Him even a penis got chatty . <P> But writer-director Amy Heckerling , 35 , had an adult agenda in mind . " It 's . " Babies do n't need fathers , but mothers do . Someone who is taking care of a baby needs to be taken care of . I was trying to deal with those issues . The talking baby was comic relief . " <P> It has brought blessed relief to a few careers . For the Kansas-born Alley , " this is my big blockbuster . Like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz , I 'm clicking my heels . " Travolta , back on top after years of languishing , says the movie " makes people happy . It makes them feel good about having a family . Men tell me , ' You 're giving me lessons in how to be a dad . ' Women say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , it thrills me to pieces . " It thrills Hollywood too . The town is always pleased to welcome a baby with such a humongous silver spoon .
