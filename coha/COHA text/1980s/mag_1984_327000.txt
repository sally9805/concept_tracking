Trying to punish a network <P> The two-part investigation , broadcast to viewers of ABC 's World News Tonight last September , was bizarre by any measure . Scott Barnes , who has sometimes presented himself as a " paramilitary expert , " claimed he had taken a job as a prison guard in 1983 at the request of the CIA to watch Ronald Rewald , a Honolulu investment counselor who is under indictment for defrauding approximately 400 investors of $22 million . Barnes said that the CIA then told him , " We got ta take him out . " According to the ABC show , Rewald 's company had provided cover for several CIA operations , including the arrangement of secret arms shipments to Syria and Taiwan . The CIA denied the story , and two weeks ago ABC issued a " clarification . " Barnes had refused to take a lie-detector test , said ABC Anchor Peter Jennings , and checking showed that his " charges can not be substantiated and we have no reason to doubt the CIA 'S denial . " <P> ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the unprecedented step of filing a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission . The CIA charged that ABC violated the FCC 's Fairness Doctrine by broadcasting " outlandish statements " in " reckless disregard for the truth . " ( The fairness regulation requires that broadcasters " afford reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints . " ) The CIA took the unusual action because the Supreme Court has indicated that federal agencies can not sue news organizations for libel . In its complaint the CIA asked that the FCC order ABC to retract " all false allegations , " and that it consider not renewing the licenses of the stations the network owns . <P> Determining the truth of the ABC story may prove difficult because the CIA 'S link with Rewald is murky . At the agency 's request , a U.S. district-court judge in Hawaii has sealed all documents in a federal proceeding involving the investment counselor on the grounds of national security . CIA Spokeswoman Kathy Pherson says flatly of Barnes : " The CIA has never had any relationship " with him . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government can penalize allegedly false criticism of one of its operations by withdrawing the license of a station . Declares First Amendment Expert James Goodale of New York University Law School : " The approach by the CIA is heavyhanded and shows that it does n't understand the law . " Lawyer Floyd Abrams , who represents the media in many First Amendment cases , agrees , saying . " The remedy for the CIA is to participate in controversy and discussion in the court of public opinion . "
