The suspense thriller known as The Perils of People Express took a sudden new turn last week  --  but the denouement was not yet in sight . Almost three weeks after the revolutionary no-frills airline announced that it was looking to sell part or all of its operations to fend off bankruptcy , People found the buyer it needed . People 's five-member board declared that United Airlines , the largest U.S. commercial carrier , would pay $146 million for Frontier Airlines , the Denver company that People picked up only last November . The same day , People 's board rejected as " inadequate " an offer from Houston 's Texas Air to buy the entire airline for $9 a share , a sum that some analysts estimated to be about $240 million . <P> Behind that seeming resolution of People 's difficulties , however , the plot thickened . There were muted signs of a boardroom power struggle in Newark , the airline 's headquarters , that might still be unresolved . People 's financial woes , meanwhile , could hardly be described as over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional , limited time in which to become a more traditional , full-service passenger carrier . That would be the very opposite of the strategy that in five years made the carrier 's name a byword and irrevocably shook up the economics of U.S. flying . <P> Under the terms of the buyout , United will pay $50 million for Denver-based Frontier by this week , a clear sign of People 's desperation for cash . After dropping an estimated $103 million in the first half of the year , People was believed to have less than $50 million in cash on hand , and is still losing about $4 million a week . Even so , the decision to sell off some of the company 's assets was not made voluntarily by People Founder and Chairman Donald Burr . The move was forced on Burr by the remaining board members . The insurgents were led by Venture Capitalist William Hambrecht of San Francisco , whose firm raised $23.5 million in the early development of People , and by Charles Phillips , a managing director of Morgan Stanley , People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board has clipped Burr 's wings and is now running the show . " <P> Experts estimate that the distress sale gave People a cash transfusion good for perhaps several months of life . Within that time , the airline must begin to succeed on the new course that it set in May , to become a conventional airline competing for business travelers . Many industry specialists are doubtful that People , with its reputation for spartan travel conditions and first-come , first-served seating , will be able to convince passengers that it has made the switch . Says J. Henry Riefle , general manager of Manhattan 's Hardach Travel Service : " No matter what People Express does , it will always be perceived as a low-cost , no-frills carrier . You ca n't expect a $300,000-a- year executive to worry about saving $45 on a flight to Pittsburgh . " <P> If People is to continue to fly , it must build up clientele to make it through the lean winter flying period . Last week 's sale may just make that possible , but for some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories is likely to remain a cliff-hanger.
