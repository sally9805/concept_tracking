This is the sixth year on the ballot for Williams , which is already ridiculous in view of the record he compiled during an outstanding 18-year major league career . Billy had a lifetime . 290 batting average , with 426 home runs and 1 , 476 RBIs . He was the National League Rookie of the Year in 1961 and the batting champion in 1972 , played in 1 , 117 consecutive games in one multi-season stretch , batted over . 300 five times , and hit 20 or more homers 14 times. // // One can ' t get away from the thought that these numbers would have put the slugging outfielder in Cooperstown long ago if he had played for more contending teams and/or in New York or on the West Coast . But Williams spent most of his career with the lowly Chicago Cubs of the 1960s and early ' 70s , where he was pretty much out of the media spotlight. // This shouldn ' t have anything do to with it , of course , but over the years it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s first year of eligibility , for example , he was named on only 97 of the 415 ballots cast , finishing a distant 13th in the voting. // He has moved up steadily , however , and last year was named on 315 of the 425 ballots - a tantalizing four votes shy of the 75 percent required for election. // Such a showing would seem to virtually guarantee his election this year - and as the statistics above indicate , it will be none too soon. // The committee making up this year ' s ballot has listed 28 candidates altogether - 23 returnees and five players newly eligible after the five-year waiting period following the end of their careers . The voting by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America is being conducted between now and Dec. 31 , with the results to be announced early next year . And while Williams is by far the most clear-cut choice , there are a lot of other names on the list for which one can make a fairly strong case. // Catfish Hunter , who won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numerous playoff and World Series appearances , is probably the next strongest possibility . The former Oakland and New York Yankee star got strong support two years ago in his first appearance on the ballot and moved up last year to third place - behind only Willie McCovey ( who was elected ) and Williams. // A legitimate question , though , is why Jim Bunning , who finished 10 votes further back in fourth place a year ago , shouldn ' t get at least the same amount of support . The former Detroit and Philadelphia stalwart equaled Hunter ' s victory total despite pitching for much weaker teams , is 10th on the all-time strikeout list , and had 40 shutouts , including two no-hitters. // Based on last year ' s vote totals , Williams , Hunter , and Bunning are by far the ' ' big three ' ' among returning candidates - and the only ones with enough previous support to have any realistic hope of election . Their chances are strengthened this year , too , by the fact that there are no exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this quintet will probably be Bobby Bonds , but all you have to do is look at his . 268 batting average with 332 home runs and 1 , 024 RBIs - figures that don ' t begin to compare with those of Williams - to realize what a long shot he would be . Of course Bonds was one of those rare players who combined speed with power , and he got a lot of publicity for such feats as hitting 30 or more homers and stealing 30 or more bases in the same season five times. // Also newly eligible is Mike Marshall , who pitched for several teams in a 14-year career , set a major league record by appearing in 106 games for Los Angeles in 1974 , and is high on the all-time list for both wins and saves by a relief pitcher . The other first-timers are Sal Bando , who had a fine 16-year career mostly with the Oakland A ' s ; Jerry Grote , a solid catcher who also put in 16 big-league seasons and whose strong defensive work helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Steve Stone , who pitched for several teams over an 11-year span , climaxing his career with a 25-7 Cy Young Award year at Baltimore in 1980. // All good players , to be sure , but it seems clear that none of these newcomers has the credentials to be elected in his first year of eligibility , if ever. // As for the other returnees , their vote totals in previous years don ' t offer much hope - although some of them certainly have the statistics to merit more than a passing glance. // Take base-stealing wizard Maury Wills , for example . Shortstops have historically received less than their due from the voters , who seem overly fascinated by slugging statistics , and Wills has been no exception . The former Los Angeles Dodger star hit . 281 , led the National League in steals six straight years , and got the job done in the field , but has never received the sort of vote that would indicate he has any chance of eventual election. // Ditto , unfortunately , for Lew Burdette , a renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly with the old Milwaukee Braves , and who beat the mighty New York Yankees three times in the 1957 World Series , and for Mickey Lolich , who had 217 victories and 2 , 832 strikeouts , and who also rose to the occasion in World Series play with three victories for Detroit over St. Louis in 1968 . Both of these outstanding hurlers would seem to be in the same category as Hunter and Bunning , but neither has ever received comparable support. // And that hardly exhausts the list of possibilities . Tony Oliva was a three-time American League batting champion who hit over . 300 six times , and whose lifetime . 304 average is the highest of any current candidate . Harvey Kuenn won only one batting title , but bettered . 300 on eight occasions and finished just behind Oliva with a . 303 career mark. // Bill Mazeroski is remembered primarily for the home run he hit to win the 1960 World Series , but the longtime Pittsburgh second baseman did a lot more than that in his 17 seasons , performing well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catcher-infielder Joe Torre ( . 297 with good power statistics ) and slugger Orlando Cepeda ( also . 297 with 379 homers and 1 , 365 RBIs ) are also worth considering. // The rest of this year ' s candidates , all of whom have their supporters , are Dick Allen , Ken Boyer , Elroy Face , Curt Flood , Elston Howard , Don Larsen , Roger Maris , Minnie Minoso , Thurman Munson , Vada Pinson , Ron Santo , and Wilbur Wood. // The maximum number for which one can vote , however , is 10 - so some outstanding candidates have to be left off . It ' s a tough call , but after spinning it all around in my own mental computer , I decided to go this year with ( in alphabetical order ) Bunning , Burdette , Cepeda , Hunter , Lolich , Mazeroski , Oliva , Torre , Williams , and Wills. // //
