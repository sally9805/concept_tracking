Mr. Bingham , the 44-year-old scion of a prominent New England family , had been charged with smuggling a pistol to George Jackson , a member of the Black Panther Party who had written a best-selling book about his prison experiences . Mr. Jackson died in the shootout , which occurred shortly after Mr. Bingham visited him at the prison. // Under California law , prosecutors said , providing the gun to Mr Jackson would have made Mr. Bingham equally liable for the deaths . <> <> ' A Word of Encouragement ' // Mr. Bingham and many of his supporters who had attended the 2 1/2-month trial before Judge E. Warren McGuire in Marin County Superior Court in San Rafael burst into tears upon hearing the verdict. // The jury deliberated 6 days after hearing the testimony of 61 witnesses . Mary Bradford , a retired teacher who served as foreman of the jury , said jurors had voted not to comment on the case. // Mr. Bingham said he felt the verdict spoke " a word of encouragement " to people who become involved in unpopular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now that this case is over , maybe people will focus their attention on what ' s wrong with prison conditions. " // Although the trial began April 7 , its roots were in the era of sometimes bitter radical ferment that shook the country in the late 1960 ' s. // A graduate of Milton Academy , Yale and Boalt Hall , the law school at the University of California at Berkeley , Mr. Bingham was a product of a patrician New England background . His grandfather , Hiram Bingham , an archeologist , helped discover the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru and served Connecticut as Governor and United States Senator . His father , Alfred , who was in the courtroom for most of the trial , is a retired Connecticut probate judge. // After his graduation from Yale in 1964 , Mr. Bingham ' s life was a virtual catalogue of liberal causes of the day : He took part in the civil rights movement in Mississippi , campaigned against the Vietnam War , spent two years as a member of the Peace Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chavez in his battle to form a farm workers ' union . <> <> Movement Toward Radicalism // As he grew older , Mr. Bingham later told friends , he became disillusioned with liberalism as a means to social justice and moved further to the left , eventually adopting some Marxist views. // By early 1971 , Stephen Bingham , a bearded lawyer living in a commune in nearby Berkeley , was working in a variety of radical causes , including efforts to help black prisoners . It was then that his life became intertwined with that of Mr. Jackson. // In January 1970 , a guard at Soledad State Prison in central California shot to death three black inmates who were involved in a scuffle in the exercise yard . Several days later , Mr. Jackson and two other black inmates at Soledad were charged with murdering another guard in revenge. // To Mr. Bingham and many other white radicals , the three inmates , who would soon be known as the " Soledad Brothers , " were symbols of what they considered racially motivated oppression of blacks in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been in prison since 1961 for a $71 robbery , had embraced Marxism and became a leader of the Black Panther Party , which advocated revolutionary acts against the police . He wrote " Soledad Brother , " a book about prison life that became a best seller. // Deputy District Attorney Terry Boren of Marin County , who prosecuted Mr. Bingham , contended that Mr. Jackson subsequently enlisted Mr. Bingham in an escape plot , one that led to the bloody violence at San Quentin Aug. 21 , 1971. // Mr. Bingham , he alleged , smuggled the gun , ammunition and a wig to Mr. Jackson in a tape recorder and briefcase after it had been given to him by Vanita Anderson , a member of the Black Panther Party who was a research assistant to Mr. Jackson . <> <> Testimony of Prison Guards // Miss Anderson , now an instructor at Los Angeles Community College , has never been charged with any crime and did not testify at Mr. Bingham ' s trial . Mr. Boren said he did not subpoena her as a witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional grounds. // At Mr. Bingham ' s trial , guards testified that moments after Mr. Jackson finished a private meeting with Mr. Bingham , they detected a " shiny object " in the wig , which they said he was wearing. // The guards testified that Mr. Jackson then pulled a gun out of the wig and , shouting " They caught me ; the dragon has come , " took control of a section of San Quentin reserved for difficult prisonors . Within 30 minutes , six people were dead - three guards , two prison inmates and Mr. Jackson , who was shot to death by guards. // In 1971 , six prisoners were charged with joining in what the authorities say was an escape attempt . One , Johnny Spain , was convicted of two counts of murder ; two inmates were convicted of assault , and three were aquitted. // The authorities also named Mr. Bingham as a conspirator with Mr. Jackson in the prison violence . They argued , as Mr. Boren did at the trial , that Mr. Bingham was the only person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore was the only person who could have given Mr. Jackson the gun and other contraband. // Under California law , the prosecutor argued , Mr. Bingham was equally guilty in the slaying of two of the guards . Judge McGuire had earlier ruled that there was insufficient evidence to try Mr. Bingham for the death of the third guard. // Mr. Bingham , who in the summer of 1971 visited Mr. Jackson six times at San Quentin , vanished a few hours after the violence and lived as a fugitive in this country and abroad for 13 years until he gave himself up July 9 , 1984 . At the trial , he testified that he had fled because he believed prison guards had killed Mr. Jackson to end his revolutionary activities and that his own life was in dagner. // When he surrendered , he said he thought he could now get a fair trial. // " I am convinced , " he said when he came out of hiding , " that most Americans reflecting back on the late 60 ' s and early 70 ' s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the Government did , at times , engage in illegal , excessive and immoral practices in trying to discredit those who were working actively for change.
