" Reagan and his redefinition of what to admire in our national character proved to be the irresistible forces of the campaign , " writes William Henry in his account of the lopsided 1984 election . Reagan won 59% of the popular vote not because he outcampaigned Walter Mondale . Instead , says Henry , who covered the election as TIME 's Press writer and is now the magazine 's drama critic , the winning candidate identified himself with the growing national appetite " for optimism , for prosperity , for the strength of the individual and the stability of the national defense . " Mondale 's jeremiads about fairness and budget deficits were well aimed , in Henry 's view , but the cola- commercial vision of America that Reagan sold voters had little room for unpleasant realities . Democrats should watch more television . <P> Henry has avoided the ordinary postelection recap of secret strategy sessions and off-camera skulduggery . Instead , Visions is a delightfully opinionated essay on politics , social change and the rise of the political right .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
