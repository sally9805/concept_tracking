The ingenuity of President Reagan 's Middle East peace plan , as several observers have noted , is that it seeks to make a distinction ( a chasm , more likely ) between Prime Minister Begin and his annexation policies on the one hand , and the enduring safety of Israel on the other . But the Prime Minister and the issue of Israel 's safety are not so easily separated . Begin gained much of his power by appealing to his people 's fear of national annihilation , a fear that is genuine in him , and not a political expedient . Indeed , the reason its expression carries such weight in Israel is that it is not an idea of the moment , but one that lies so deep in Jewish thought it is often inexpressible . Begin understands Jewish thought . What he understands specifically is that a great many Jews live with their eyes fixed on the past , for good reason ; and when they are called upon to make fundamental choices , they will turn to the past for guidance , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the question is , How much past is enough ? At what point does a devotion to history cease to be a weapon against present and future error , and begin to cripple those who seek its protection ? This is hardly a problem for Israelis alone , but at the moment they are stage center in the world , and until they begin to find a solution it will not make the slightest difference whether Begin is ousted from office or whether a few more West Bank settlements go up or down , or even whether the Palestinians gain autonomy . It is no easy matter . The past is absolute , adamant , like Begin himself . Anyone who wishes to control it is taking on an adversary that grows bigger by the second . <P> Of course , one can always try the American approach and pretend to ignore the past entirely . Jews have generally taken the opposite tack : to yank the past into the present so forcibly that time has virtually no demarcations . Part of the Passover ritual is the exhortation that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egypt . The presentness of death is a central element of Judaism . The various prayers of lamentation , the practice of shivah ( the seven-day period of mourning ) , the published announcements of grief , all lie at the heart of a faith that looks solely to this world for redemption . <P> The trouble is that this world has not provided the Jews with much redemption . Instead , the main events in Jewish history , until the founding of Israel , consisted mostly of disasters : the destruction of the Temple , the Diaspora , the Holocaust , each devastation considerably more terrible and unimaginable than the one it followed . These days Begin cites Genesis as the font of his politics , but his abiding source is the Holocaust , as it is for much of Israel . To the importance of individual death in Judaism , the Holocaust added a national significance . Here was the death of deaths , 6 million gone . Just as the past becomes the present , so did the image of the Holocaust enter the soul of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from the grave that had been dug for them , inspired by the Holocaust as are Christians by the agony of the cross .
