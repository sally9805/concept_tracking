Last fall , Frank was getting into fights during neighborhood football and basketball games in Pittsburgh . Yesterday the 20-year- old rode through Boston in a wagon train . " I ' m learning how to stay out of trouble and how to live on my own , " he said , as he took in the sights of the city riding in one of nine covered wagons traveling through New England . " I ' m doing it because I want to live on my own . " Frank is one of 50 troubled juveniles , many convicted of serious crimes , on the wagon train making its way to Maine . Instead of going to jail , they chose to work on a wagon train for at least one year as part of the so-called VisionQuest program . " It ' s an alternative to the traditional system , " said wagonmaster Steve Bloom , as he directed the train down Huntington avenue . " They need a way out of the system and we give them that opportunity . " The youths , ranging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drive the wagons , take care of the horses , and set up teepees at campgrounds or in open fields to spend the night . " It teaches them how to take responsibility for their lives , " said Bloom , a native of Natick . " They see that no one is going to look out for them . " Bloom said that in addition to learning how to take care of themselves , the teenagers spend time " working out the problems that got them here - families and all sorts of abuse . You don ' t get in trouble just to get in trouble . " VisionQuest was founded in 1973 by a Tuscon , Ariz. , youth counselor who was frustrated with the juvenile corrections system . Beginning with a contract to take six Arizona youths out of a state reform school , the program now has bases in Pennsylvania , New Mexico and Colorado and trains throughout the country .

The Maine train began as the Key West train last September when it left Pennsylvania for Florida . After arriving there in February , the travelers began the trek north and expect to reach Maine in August . From there , they will return to Pennsylvania . Wearing blue jeans , VisionQuest T-shirts , cowboy boots , and bandannas , the teenagers rode up Huntington avenue from West Roxbury , past the Boston Common , through the North End , and over the Charlestown Bridge toward Somerville on their trip through Boston . For a city youth like Frank , who joined the train in Virginia last fall , learning the tasks and sleeping outdoors with all the bugs wasn ' t easy for the first two or three weeks . Since then , he has met his Mississippi grandparents for the first time when the train went through the area , and is even thinking about getting a horse and going to live there , where his grandparents own a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom tell him he ' s abandoned the gang , he said he wouldn ' t trade the outdoors life for city life . " I just tell them I don ' t want to be home , " he said . " I want to be out here . "
