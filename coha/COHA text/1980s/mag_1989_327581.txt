Now that the U.S. is talking to Yasser Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organization , what should the next step be ? For Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan 's King Hussein , two moderates whose unofficial alliance is seen by the U.S. as a key to peace in the region , the answer is obvious  --  and familiar : get the U.S. to budge Israel . <P> In interviews last week with TIME managing editor Henry Muller and chief of correspondents John Stacks , the Arab leaders each emphasized that the incoming Bush Administration should make the Middle East a top priority and must persuade ( a polite word for " pressure " ) Israel 's newly formed unity government to enter peace negotiations aimed at reaching a settlement fair to the Palestinians . <P> Mubarak and Hussein see no realistic alternative to strong American activism , since Arafat has made some important concessions on the Arab side but Israel 's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir remains adamant in refusing demands that his country withdraw from the disputed territories . " You have your own connections with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard with the Israelis , but we ca n't play in the court alone . You should find a way to tackle this problem of how to persuade the Israelis to move forward in the peace process . " <P> Despite evidence that the U.S. is usually reluctant to exert pressure on Israel in matters of war and peace and doubts that Israel would listen anyway , Hussein sees Bush 's experience in foreign affairs as reason for Arab optimism . " The U.S. can do much with Israel , and it needs to do much in the times ahead , " he said . Bush " knows the area . With all due respect , I had many meetings with President Reagan , ( ( but ) ) he had other priorities . Of all the problems the world has , ( ( the Middle East ) ) is the most dangerous . " <P> Mubarak and Hussein , speaking separately in Cairo and Amman , discouraged any suggestion that Bush should come up with a new set of peace proposals . As they see it , all the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already favor the convening of an international conference that includes Palestinian representation . " We do n't need any more new ; initiatives , " Hussein said . " There is a general agreement that an international conference would be the venue for the establishment of peace . All the parties have to participate . The Palestinians have to be involved . So we have to get on with it , rather than start looking for new formulas . " <P> Mubarak said that Shamir should not fear that Arab states will gang up on Israel during negotiations . " Frankly speaking , " he said , " I wonder why he fears an international conference . It will lead immediately to direct negotiations , " as Shamir demands . Shamir is now suggesting he might countenance U.N . sponsorship to launch peace talks , but he remains firmly opposed to any more substantive international participation . In a separate interview in Jerusalem , Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens explained why . At an international conference , he said , " there 's the danger of having pressure applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make peace but by other parties who may have other interests .
