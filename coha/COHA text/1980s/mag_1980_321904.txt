An informer 's personal sting <P> In the new tradition of catchy labels for FBI undercover operations-Abscam , Brilab , Miporn-a new one came to light last week that might be named Son of Abscam . An illegitimate son , to be sure : this sting victimized innocent , though gullible , California businessmen . It was run not by the FBI but by one of the agency 's informers , who went into business on the side for himself . <P> The informer , Joseph B. Meltzer , 55 , was recruited by the FBI soon after he was convicted in 1978 by a court in West Palm Beach , Fla. , for possession of $100,000 in stolen securities . He was sentenced to 30 months in prison . The FBI sought his advice in conducting the Abscam bribery sting that eventually implicated seven Congressmen and Democratic Senator Harrison Williams of New Jersey . While helping the FBI , Meltzer learned that , to lure politicians into the Abscam net , the FBI had set up a phony investment firm called Abdul Enterprises in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was eager to invest part of his vast fortune in the U.S. <P> Meltzer soon turned up in California , representing himself as a top officer of H &; J Real Estate Investment of Boynton Beach , Fla. , which he said was an offshoot of Abdul Enterprises , and began lining up investment opportunities for Sheik Rahman . The sheik , Meltzer told local businessmen , would lend huge sums to entrepreneurs for promising new ventures ; he promised $95 million to one businessman for four tuna boats . But Meltzer demanded that the businessmen first pay him finder 's fees . He collected $150,000 . <P> Meltzer told some of the businessmen that he was an undercover FBI agent . Those who got in touch with the FBI about him discovered that he did indeed have a connection , if only because Meltzer immediately phoned them back . Several told the New York Times that the knowledge increased their confidence in Meltzer , but some did get suspicious . Meltzer kept summoning them to distant locations-New York City , London , the Cayman Islands-to pick up their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not letting borrowers meet the sheik . <P> Kai Gulve , a San Diego financial consultant whose clients gave Meltzer $55,000 , told TIME that Meltzer did introduce him to two supposed sons of the sheik in Florida . One was called Prince Ali Ben Ramon , a light-skinned man who spoke with an Oxford accent and drove a Rolls-Royce . The other was Mustafa , a much swarthier man who drove a red Mercedes . Gulve also spoke on the phone to someone who identified himself as Sheik Rahman , and found his accent decidedly Eastern . Says Gulve : " I told him that if he was the sheik , he must own all of Brooklyn . " <P> The businessmen complained to the FBI , and the bureau 's San Diego office dutifully began an investigation . It was stopped on orders from the New York City FBI officials supervising the Abscam operation , who feared that any talk about Meltzer would blow the bigger sting . Not until last October was the FBI 's information on Meltzer turned over to the U.S. Attorney in San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
