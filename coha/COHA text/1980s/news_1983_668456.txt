ROCKLAND , Maine - For Linda and Doug Lee , life is sailing and raising children , although not necessarily in that order . They started their marriage with a honeymoon at sea , and now they ' re putting the finishing touches on a 95-foot schooner , the Heritage , which they and a dozen crew hands built from the keel up . In fact , the Lees ' 2 1/2 - year- old daughter , Clara , learned to walk to the roll of a sailing ship that her parents - both licensed skippers - piloted . " All the time we ' re under way , she has a harness on , " says Linda , adding that she expects her second daughter , now 2 1/2 months old , also will take her first steps with sea legs . Linda worked on the Heritage , which she will christen next Saturday , until about a month before the younger daughter , Rachel , was born . " I would have gone longer , except for all the paperwork " she handles for the family ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels . The Lees broke into the ship business in 1971 , when they bought and rehabilitated the Isaac H. Evans . They first sailed it 10 years ago . Using modern tools but traditional shipbuilding methods , the Lees and their crew built the latest in a three-schooner family fleet that will carry passengers up and down the Maine coast , where sailing ships of the old days carried timber , granite , coal and other materials . One reason for building the Heritage , Linda says , is that it could be designed for a family of four that will be living aboard during the four-month sailing season . Below the main deck , a ladder separates two wood-paneled cabins , each with two bunks . A tiny latrine is built off to one side of the children ' s cabin . It ' s hardly spacious by landlubber standards , but comfortable - and better than the crew ' s four bunks in the galley . It ' s the life the Lees love . " It ' s been difficult , with financial worries , getting loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Linda , who will turn 35 next week . The ship will carry 33 passengers , who will pay up to $400 a week for vacation trips off Maine ' s island-dotted coast . " This is by far the biggest vessel we ' ve ever had anything to do with , " says Doug , who grew up in Bath and has sailed and worked on ships for almost all of his 36 years . " It ' s Love Boat ' size . " Lee , who has degrees in mechanical engineering , started designing the wooden Heritage in 1979 , carefully following traditional , 19th Century schooner lines . From the start , the project has proceeded under the watchful eyes of a US Coast Guard inspector who made sure safety standards were met . At night , " we did little paintings to choose the colors , " says Linda , now standing near the red hull as the vessel is painstakingly winched toward tracks that will carry it to the sea . The ship ' s sides are painted ivory and white , streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which been under construction for 20 months , will join Maine ' s " windjammer " fleet of about 20 sailing vessels , which Linda says is the largest fleet of its kind in any state . The Lees and their partner , another young schooner captain , John Foss , own three ships in all - the Lewis R. French , the Isaac H. Evans and the Heritage . " This is the first vessel we ' ve built from scratch , " says Doug Lee . " Hopefully , there ' ll be more if business is good . " He says the Heritage ' s launching day will feature something of a historical twist . When the newest schooner hits the waves , the Lewis R. French , the oldest sailing ship of US registry , will be anchored in the nearby harbor . Built in 1871 , the French has been completely rebuilt . The only difference between the Heritage and an original , says Doug , is the 20-ton lead keel that the Coast Guard requires for safety . Linda says the ship cost about $300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by her , Doug and Foss , or the use of the shipyard . They expect to finish the Heritage a year ahead of schedule , but they have been waiting for its two masts to arrive from Washington state . Meanwhile , the final work is being done on the ship ' s 4500 square feet of canvas sails .
