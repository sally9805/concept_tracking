 | At 15 , Gelsey Kirkland did what thousands of little girls dream about doing : she joined the New York City Ballet and became the Sugar Plum Fairy . By 28 she had long been one of the most famous and admired ballerinas in the country . She was also a drug addict . By now , of course , Americans have read about drug abuse in every glamorous calling : rock stars die in their 20s ; a famous comedian goes on a speedball binge and ends up choking to death ; one of the most talented college basketball players in the land dies of a cocaine overdose . And now the dance world , where illusions prove to be just as destructive . Kirkland 's cautionary tale ? which she @# shares in " Dancing On My Grave " ( Doubleday . $17.5 ) is more than a drug story . It is about a collision between ambition and naivete , in a world where no one can afford to miss a step . Dancers represent in pure form our national obsession with the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up in a cage of self-doubt , crash diets , 10-hour days and an unforgiving mirror . Because they love to dance , they 'll do anything to keep themselves performing ? they 'll even try to lie to their own bodies . As a teenager Kirkland had her breasts and lips enlarged with silicone and her earlobes trimmed ; she starved herself periodically and later learned to vomit to keep her weight down . Most people as sick as she was get help . Kirkland got applause ? and her frightening success raises troubling questions about a dream career . Five feet four inches tall and weighing less than 100 pounds , Kirkland projects an image of frailty on stage ; but her outspoken memoir describes how she became both a monster and a victim in the ballet world , starting with her refusal to join the Balanchine cult at the New York City Ballet . Kirkland was not entirely immune : her first bouts with anorexia were a manic effort to emulate Balanchine 's favorite ballerinas . But at heart Kirkland found his choreography empty . Abstract and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Balanchine 's work seemed to her to be a perverse departure from European classicism . Her portrayal of Balanchine is bitter ; one night , she says , when she was too sick to dance , he gave her what he called vitamins . She danced brilliantly ? but someone warned her against taking any more of them . Kirkland now believes her teacher gave her amphetamines . Raging battles : An affair with the then dancer Peter Martins convinced her that the two of them were ripe for escape , perhaps to a European company . But Martins backed down , as she tells it ? and today he is Balanchine 's successor . Finally it was Mikhail Baryshnikov who provided a way out . Baryshnikov had seen her perform on tour in Russia ; right after his defection in 1974 he had an interpreter invite her to dance with him . Their partnership at American Ballet Theatre was an artistic triumph but a personal catastrophe , and the love affair that accompanied it was bleak . She describes him as a moody , uncommunicative and negligent lover ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never sympathized with her need to analyze and dissect every role . Eventually their technical and emotional differences led to raging battles in the studio , and a great pas de deux disintegrated . So did Kirkland . In this period of disappointment , frustration and isolation , she turned to cocaine and embarked on a hellish few years of addiction . She continued dancing , more or less , but in shambles . Her view is that as long as her name sold tickets , she was going to be danced to death ; and she points out that she was n't the only drug abuser at ABT . At the door of a drug deal-  | life . Kirkland and Greg Lawrence fell in love over cocaine and his poetry , and managed to help each other quit drugs on a farm in upstate New York . They 're now married and living in London , where Kirkland is performing with the Royal Ballet . In their photograph on the book jacket , he looks stern and manly and she looks coy , as she always does ? hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ballet world , Kirkland 's disastrous course is hardly typical ; but the problems she was trying to solve with cocaine are familiar to every company member . Physically , of course , ballet hurts ? the workout is more demanding than most sports , and dancers have to look beautiful while they 're at it . But the psychological pressures are even more intense . Dancers start training as children , and by the age of 12 or 13 they are preparing in earnest for their profession . With little education and scant energy for life outside the company , they live in a rarefied world surrounded by fantasies of perfection they ca n't possibly realize . The reward for all that hard labor is a good role , but the major New York companies still run according to an oddly paternalistic system in which the dancers are treated as children ( traditionally they 're called " boys " and " girls " ) and never told why or how they are being chosen or rejected . " There 's no communication , nobody knows what 's expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The only way you know how you 're doing is by the roles you get . Sometimes if you 're not cast it 's because something else is coming , but you do n't know that . Then , people who are upset stop taking class or they go on a binge and gain weight . And when the opportunity comes , they 've blown it . " Perhaps the greatest source of frustration for a dancer is his or her own body , which becomes the focus of constant , obsessive scrutiny and dissatisfaction . Kirkland 's virtually insane dieting was exceptional , but undernutrition is now so habitual in female dancers that they risk developing osteoporosis at a young age . Studies are beginning to show that injuries , viruses and menstrual irregularities occur frequently , too , as dancers pursue an esthetic ideal of absurd thinness . " I know a lot of dancers who are surviving on caffeine and cigarettes , " says an ABT ballerina . " They look fantastic , but at the end of the year they look like a wreck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the traditional ways of dealing with problems in the ballet world . " When Balanchine was alive , people were terrified to let him know that they were injured , for fear he would n't give you a certain role , " recalls an NYCB dancer . " I still feel I have to hide my injuries ; it 's ingrained in me . " But dancers these days do not seem to be turning to hard drugs . New York company members agree that the early 1980s were a time of serious drug abuse at both ABT and NYCB ; since then , they say , most of the buyers and sellers have left the companies . The only notable drug problem these days seems to be at ABT , where some dancers report a lot of marijuana being smoked in the dressing rooms out of sheer boredom with the repertory . Would a dancer like Kirkland find help more easily today ? Perhaps . A handful of ballet companies , including the San Francisco Ballet and the Cleveland Ballet , are now affiliated with clinics that specialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . But the traditional basis of life in a ballet company has not changed : dancers are trained to obey orders and to dance , no matter what else may be happening to them . " We have physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons and all that sort of thing , " says a member of ABT . " But looking out for dancers ' mental health means to develop mature-thinking people who look out for their own interests . And you do n't want that . You want kids who shut up and do what they 're told . " @# @#
