Mutiny at the N.A.A.C.P. <P> For three-quarters of a century the N.A.A.C.P. , resolutely mainstream in its struggles for racial justice , has been the most important U.S. civil rights organization . Yet the group has been adrift for almost a decade , and its membership has been halved to fewer than 200,000 . Now open mutiny seems to have broken out at the top . With a curt letter sent last week , Margaret Bush Wilson , chairman of the N.A.A.C.P. board of directors , summarily suspended Executive Director Benjamin Hooks . <P> Hooks , a former Federal Communications Commissioner who has battled with Wilson since taking the N.A.A.C.P. job in 1977 , stood fast , refusing to hand over power to Wilson 's designated caretaker . Said Hooks : " I 'm still functioning . " And he may still be next week , after the 64-member board , loaded with Hooks partisans , has an emergency meeting . " We will have to decide who is the real spokesman for the N.A.A.C.P. , " said the Rev. Edward Hailes , a board member . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wilson , 64 , from St. Louis , and Hooks , 58 , a Memphis native : both are lawyers who grew up in middle-class black families in Mississippi River cities during the Depression . Wilson began her latest maneuvers against Hooks at a special board meeting she convened last month . There she bitterly accused him of mismanagement , which she says has tarnished the N.A.A.C.P. 'S reputation within the philanthropic community . She had the board pass a resolution reaffirming her position at the top of the N.A.A.C.P. hierarchy . <P> Most board members , whatever their qualms about Hooks , are fuming at Wilson , and say they did not realize that she intended last month 's endorsement as a prelude to last week 's power grab . Her main charge is that Hooks has refused to release records that would , she says , document his administrative bungling . But , said Hailes , " I do n't know of any materials requested that have not been turned over . " Indeed , it looks now as though Wilson is the one in jeopardy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel Dukes , " the vote would be 61 for Hooks to 3 for Wilson . "
