' ' Brazilian Eisenhower ' ' is how one analyst describes Tancredo Neves , Brazil ' s first civilian president in 21 years. // The short , quick-moving , balding figure , who takes office tomorrow , is a respected political moderate . He is a conciliator . And at age 74 , he is a survivor of a good many political wars. // // Dr. Tancredo , as he is popularly known , started his political career 50 years ago as a prosecuting attorney in his home town of Sao Joao del Rey , a small mountain community in Minas Gerais State , some 400 miles from Rio de Janeiro. // Mineiros are known for being conciliatory and tight-lipped , traits Neves has shown throughout his career . These qualities are widely viewed as helping him to come from behind in this past year ' s presidential race - and eventually to win the support of the business community and even large sectors of the military. // He served as justice minister to populist President Getulio Vargas in the 1950s , and as prime minister to Joao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , he has been a strong critic of the country ' s five military leaders . In 1982 , in the first nationwide elections in two decades , he was elected governor of Minas Gerais. // Neves describes himself as politically left of center . But he was spared the blackballing meted out to left-leaners who surrounded Goulart at the time of the ' 64 coup . Many analysts view him as a conservative on economic issues , but a liberal on social justice. // ' ' He is extremely honest and perhaps the embodiment of the country ' s hopes and concerns , ' ' says Ulysses Guimaraes , a longtime Brazilian politician , who is also something of a political sage here . ' ' He represents the people who have rejected extremism of both the left and the right. . . . // ' ' Elected for a six-year term , he is already talking about a constitutional amendment that would cut presidential service - including his own term of office - to four years. // Neves has always been an activist , and aides say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. // But Brazil ' s President-elect is being careful not to step on any toes . He has made it clear that he does not plan any Argentine-style legal action or retribution against the military for human-rights offenses committed in office. // He is tapping people from a broad array of political views to join his Cabinet ; both leftists and many conservatives supported his candidacy . But there are signs that staff selection is proving to be a sticky process . <> <> The Issues <> POVERTY : Some 60 million of Brazil ' s 131 million people live in dire poverty . In ' 84 , food prises often rose faster than inflation , creating increasing conditions of improper diet and malnutrition . <> UNEMPLOYMENT : Officially the jobless rate is cited as 18 percent , but most analysts agree the combined unemployment and underemployment rate is closer to 40 percent . In the big cities , where the records are kept , is unemployment is estimated at 20 million . <> INFLATION : Soared to 223 percent in 1984 and projected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monetary Fund has suggested that Brazil lower inflation to 120 percent this year - a rate President-elect Neves calls ' ' unrealistic .

There are also nearly 10 million orphaned children . <> <> THE POLITICAL LEGACY // Brazil has never really had a participatory democracy , some analysts say. // The civilian who takes charge tomorrow , as the military retreats to the barracks , was selected indirectly . An Electoral College tapped Tancredo Neves after a corps of military and business leaders had rallied around the veteran conciliatory politician. // Such nods of approval traditionally are needed to win Brazil ' s presidency . There have been some 225 political parties in the past 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 13 in existence after the 1964 coup , then allowed two parties , one pro- and one anti-government , to form . In 1979 , new laws provided for a limited multiparty system. // But most Brazilians seem unconcerned about their nation ' s leaders . Popular complaints about military rule never reached the angry pitch heard in neighboring Argentina and Uruguay. // Brazil may be more tolerant of military rule because its generals were not so repressive as those of its neighbors , and the military was responsible for tremendous economic growth in the 1960s and ' 70s. // Cultural roots are another factor : Brazil was settled largely by Portuguese , a people much less mercurial than their Spanish-speaking neighbors. // Neves says he will initiate political reforms allowing for stronger , grass-roots parties . But at present analysts see few fresh faces on the political horizon . Most key politicians made their marks decades ago. // Neves sees himself as a transitional leader .
