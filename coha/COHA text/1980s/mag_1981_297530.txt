Show of Shows <P> To the Editors : <P> TIME 'S excellent article on Nicholas Nickleby Oct. 5 only begins to describe the perfection of the Royal Shakespeare Company 's ambitious endeavor . The richness of the production is unforgettable and beyond price . Perhaps the most exhilarating moment of the entire day came at the curtain call , when an obviously overjoyed company appeared to be dumbstruck by the deafening cheers from the standing audience . <P> Ernest Spieler <P> Bristol , Conn . <P> <P> After reading your review of Nicholas Nickleby , I decided to fly to New York to see it . It is all you said and worth every penny , including the $300 it cost to make the trip . <P> Michael Herbert Shadick <P> Minneapolis <P> What is this nonsense about giving up Halstons and dinners in Manhattan to pay $100 for a seat to Nicholas Nicklebyl I need that money to buy groceries . The ultimate irony is that this ticket price is being perpetrated in the name of Charles Dickens , a champion of the poor . <P> Marlene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the show plays to empty seats , the failure will not belong to the Royal Shakespeare Company or the importers but to the Broadway audience " is as ridiculous as the exorbitant $100-a-ticket price . While your article notes that Nicholas Nickleby was a smash in London , it does not mention that there theatergoers could pay a measly $14 a seat . <P> Clifford Seixas <P> East Williston , N. Y. <P> <P> Dream House <P> I greatly enjoyed Lance Morrow 's Essay " Downsizing an American Dream ' Oct. 5 . While he recognizes the frustration of those who ca n't afford the type of home their parents owned , he neglects the plight of those whose parents were forced or chose to live in apartments . I am a second-generation rent-paying apartment dweller who has reconstrued the American dream to be a lofty one-bedroom , with Betamax and Jacuzzi , overlooking the lights of midtown Manhattan . <P> <P> Lawrence Savell <P> New York City <P> The belief that man 's condition can always be improved upon is unique to Americans . Does this mean we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil us . These pursuits are denied to many of the world 's citizens . Must we too be deprived of them or risk being labeled spoiled ? <P> <P> Stephen Ivins <P> Hayward , Calif . <P> <P> The suggestion that I should be grateful for not living as the Mongolians , Brazilians or Soviets do , or that I am overprivileged because I live in a cramped , ugly row house with nosy neighbors , reminds me that 40 years ago my grandmother told me to eat my spinach because " poor children were starving in China . " <P> <P> Hazel M. Sheehan <P> Bridgeport , Pa . <P> <P> My eyes widened at the statement that friends , even strangers , are buying homes and sharing them . True , we Americans may be spoiled , but our homes are our refuge . This amenity is what separates us from the unpredictable world . <P> <P> Tamara L.
