Heiden ' s golden hoard and a hockey upset highlight the Lake Placid Games <P> The hoisting of the five-ringed Olympic flag supposedly internationalizes a site , enfolding it in the pristine and timeless kingdom of sport . But the Winter Games at Lake Placid seemed to bear a distinctly American stamp , from the incredible hoard of gold in speed skating to the site itself , a pleasant little mountain town swamped by the world . The Games provided a kind of ritual relief during a troubled American moment , supplanting cold war fears with cheers for an ice hockey upset . Like all Olympics , the 13th Winter Games left a gallery of bright images on the retina : <P> &gt; The American hockey team exploding with jubilation after beating the seemingly invincible Soviets , 4-3 , in one of the most astonishing upsets in Olympic history , and then exploding again after defeating the scrappy Finns , 4-2 , for a gold medal . <P> &gt; Sweden 's Ingemar Stenmark snaking through the slalom gates with seemingly offhanded genius . <P> &gt; America 's Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ankle he had shattered just a year ago on the same mountain , winning a silver in the slalom , trailing only the mighty Stenmark . <P> &gt; Austria 's Annemarie Moser-Prll working the women 's downhill course with the no-nonsense smacking-and-caressing style of a baker kneading dough . <P> &gt; East Germany 's four-man bobsled team rattling down the refrigerated run on Mount Van Hoevenberg in 59.86 sec. , breaking the one-minute barrier for the first time ever , then breaking it again the next day , in 59.73 sec . <P> &gt; Alexander Tikhonov 's teammates hurling him in the air after his smooth skiing and deadeye shooting helped them win the four-man biathlon relay . For the Soviet army major , it was an unprecedented fourth gold in four Winter Olympics . <P> The two weeks were filled with stunning performances , but two were truly memorable . The underdog U.S. hockey team conquered all with its boundless enthusiasm , typically playing its best and scoring the goal that put the game against the Finns on ice when it was shorthanded because of penalties . Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were trying to do business , and nobody could . We were watching TV with one eye and Iran and the economy with the other . " But even the thrilling hockey victory could not overshadow the accomplishments of a young and unassuming speed skater from the Midwest . Perhaps the most vivid single image of the 1980 Winter Games was the sight of Eric Heiden 's heroically muscled thighs molded in a skating skin of gold as he stroked his way to five Olympic golds , five Olympic records and one world record . Nothing in Olympic history rivals that performance . <P> For chauvinists and chroniclers , the race for medals was hardly a race : the East Germans and Soviets , as usual , scooped up medals by the fistful . But thanks to Heiden and the hockey team , the U.S. did remarkably well : six golds , to nine for the East Germans and ten for the Soviets . On a per capita basis , however , the hands-down winner of the Lake Placid Games was tiny Liechtenstein ( pop . 24,000 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two golds and two silvers.
