sCANLAN 'S MONTHLY flashed across the sky of journalism on the cusp of the Sixties until it flamed out in 1971 , when its last issue was seized at the American border by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and one of its executives was killed in the struggle . The brainchild of San Francisco 's Warren Hinckle , who had catapulted Ramparts to national prominence , and of Sidney Zion of The New York Times , Scanlan 's was funded with a public stock offering and dedicated to muckraking journalism . It accepted neither advertising nor prisoners . The final issue found its way to a Canadian printer because its coverage of guerrilla warfare , complete with diagrams and instructions for the making of bombs , was ostensibly too seditious for a country whose printers had produced the First Amendment . There is reason to suspect that there were large , if not sinister , forces arrayed against the publication ? forces such as the CIA and the White House . Indeed , in one of the opening scenes in John Dean 's book , Blind Ambition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its principals because of an article critical of Vice President Agnew . Ramparts and John G. Clancy , a Columbia Law School graduate , is a writer who lives in the mountains of Utah . He practiced law in San Francisco in the Sixties and Seventies . Hinckle had earlier incurred the wrath of the CIA by exposing its involvement with private foundations and student organizations . Then , too , there was the general displeasure of the Pentagon and the FBI . This , though , is better left to Warren Hinckle to tell , when and if he updates his 1974 autobiography , If You Have a Lemon , Make Lemonade , which The New York Times selected as one of the ten best books of that year . Written when Hinckle was thirty-five , the book omits his early thirties , the Scanlan 's period , presumably because his life had already been too full . Hinckle , a portly chap who wears a black eye patch , is a P.T. Barnum of controversy who began his career in the print world by turning his monthly college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus so he could headline the fire . As beat reporter on the San Francisco Chronicle , then editor of Ramparts , then vice president and coeditor of Scanlan 's , Hinckle blazed a trail of headlines , scoops , and expos ? s designed to arouse the slumbering citizenry . In his last magazine venture he turned Francis Ford Coppola 's City of San Francisco magazine from a monthly into a weekly , and when it folded in 1976 , he had plans to make it a daily . Walking with me one day in the area of San Francisco where all three of his failed publications had been quartered , he waved his arm and said , " Look , Clanski " ? a name he insisted on calling me after I won a Supreme Court case for the American Jewish Congress ? " if you drew a line between each of the places we operated a magazine it would be almost a perfect triangle , perhaps the Bermuda Triangle of journalism . " He was fond of quoting someone to the effect that " money was for throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at City magazine hung a poster inscribed with the words of one Gully Jimson : " I want the best of everything for everyone , but it costs millions . " Often accused of fiscal extravagance , in his autobiography he countered a rumor that he had taken a plane from Chicago to Paris in order to get to New York during an airline strike . That was preposterous. he claimed . " I flew from San Francisco to Paris to get to New York . If I had been in Chicago , I would have just taken a cab . " H INCKLE WAS my editor in literary matters and my client in legal matters . During Scanlan 's lifetime my law offices , it seemed , were general counsel to the Age of Aquarius . There were the shock troops of " higher consciousness , " the forerunners of the new age such as the Esalen Institute , Alan Watts , Ida Rolf , and assorted Tai Chiists , communards , and evolved thinkers . Apart from these new humanists there were people like Hunter Thompson , the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roll bands , and a gaggle of Oakland Raiders who made a living by committing mayhem . On the one hand . I was identified with satori , enlightenment , and peace ; on the other , with violence , madness , and cocaine . This seemed prudent , for if in fact I was involved in the birthing of a new form of life , it was wise to have an antidote on hand , lest it prove dangerous . As the Scanlan 's money wound down , Hinckle often summoned me to the local Cookies Star Caf ? , where , among policemen and politicians , we formulated battle plans . The details would serve no purpose here ; suffice it to say , as Hinckle and I used to joke , that the forces of the West wanted to spend the remaining funds discovering the lost continent of Atlantis while their opponents in New York held to the view that since Uranus had a known location it was eminently more feasible to put the magazine there . One day he advised me that a decisive board meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany him to " horrible Gotham . " Over the objections of my wife , the Lady Pamela , who had come to know that adven tures with Hinckle always took longer than planned and invariably cost money , I went . E LANDED in New York half an hour late and found the meeting in progress when we ar-rived at Scanlan 's central offices . The lawyer for the opposition . who was said to have represented Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , bade that the " min-utes " of the proceedings be read for our benefit . A middle-aged woman stood and began reading in a trem-ulous voice from a stenographic pad while casting quick glances in our direction . The reason was soon apparent . Bluntly and quite unexpectedly we were informed that pursuant to proper motions and procedures Warren Hinckle was convicted of fiscal irresponsibility and stripped of all his offices at Scanlan 's , including that of co-editor . Finally , he was ordered to turn in all of his credit cards , including the air travel card that had gotten us to the meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands up to the ceiling and roared . " This is like burning down the barn after the horse is dead . " Advancing on the lawyer , he wagged a finger in his face and shouted , " If you think that this corporation is going to be put to death like your clients the Rosenbergs , you are wrong . " Into the silence that fol lowed I tossed the statement , " This is like the Scopes trial without the monkey , " and then while Hinckle yelled I proceeded to expound the slander he had suffered and describe the vast sea of litigation that would engulf all of them . The room was now full of people talking loudly and gesticulating , and the meeting was recessed . Most were stunned . I laughed . I was from California ; I was used to madness . For the balance of the evening we fell to drinking scotch and discussing Atlantis and Uranus . Clearly , though , the status of Hinekle 's credit cards was uncertain , and as we went out the door he muttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . " We hailed a cab and had it deposit us , baggage and all , at Elaine 's on the Upper East Side . I had known Elaine since I was in law school , when the place was just a struggling eatery . Hinckle had become a member of her literary round table and a good friend during his salad days with Ramparts . We staggered in with our luggage and were met with the warm embrace and raucous laughter of the then very large Elaine who bade us make ourselves at home and spend some money . Feeling like Irishmen who had found drink in the desert , we accepted this offer gladly and settled in happily at an oasis of civilization in a strange and hostile land . Hinckle proceeded to regale the literati with the tale of the board meeting and guffaws filled the room . There was much drink and even some food . It was a very pleasant evening . As dawn was breaking , we cabbed to the Plaza Hotel . I have a vague recollection of traipsing through miles of hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for persons of our prestige and station in life . W HEN I AWOKE in the morning I thought for a moment I was in Versailles . There were great French windows in my bedroom and grand tapestries and paintings that I could view from my silk-canopied fourposter bed . I stretched deliciously and began to speak French . RisAMERICAN MISCELLANY ing , I noted the leafless trees in a drab Central Park , and then it came back to me : Scanlan 's , Hinckle . I groaned . I went out into the connecting room . It was a vast living room with a television set at either end , two couches , a desk , a writing table , a conference table , a coffee table in front of the fireplace , and several stuffed easy chairs with adjacent standing lamps . I proceeded aimlessly through what seemed like endless rooms , feeling like I was in Last Year at Marienbad , until I came to a blue bedroom in which was propped Hinckle in his fourposter bed , reading The New York Times and drinking coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today we meet at lunch , at two o'clock , of course , with some shareholders who are on our side . We 'll see what we can stir up ? probably very little . " Just then the doorbell sounded in the living room . I went out and opened the door a crack . A little man in what looked to be a bellhop 's uniform or a similar official hotel costume stood there nervously licking his lips . I smiled . " Are you Mr. Hinckle ? " he snarled , baring ferretlike teeth that were amply stained . For a moment lie looked like a bellrat . " No , " I replied , " what is it that you want ? " " This , " he hissed , pulling his hand out from behind his back and waving a piece of paper at me . I had thoughts of a summons and made to close the door instinctively . " What 's this ? " came Hinckle 's voice over my back , and before I could stop him , he threw open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a towel around his waist , he resembled nothing so much as Winston Churchill at Badgastein . " You are Mr. Hinckle , " the bellrat snapped , his eyes darting in reptilian fashion . Hinckle nodded . " Then what about this , " he screeched , as he unrolled what looked like a scroll of paper . Holding it in front of him like an indictment , he began to read in a staccato voice that bordered on the hysterical : " Warren Hinckle. 1965 . Sherry-Netherland Hotel . $2,400 . Unpaid . Warren Hinckle. 1965 . Carlyle Hotel . $1,400 . Never Paid . Warren Hinckle. 1966 . Commodore Hotel . $3,400 . Never Paid . Warren Hinckle. 1967 . Roosevelt Hotel . $1,400 . Never Paid . " Hinckle and I exchanged glances as the crier continued in this fashion . reading from the list like the Martin Luther of credit . Then lie finished , sighed from his effort , looked up , and said : " Well , what about that , Mr. Hinckle , " brandishing his list of sins in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail it to Hinckle 's bare breast . Hinckle gave a regal wave of his arm and in a conversational tone replied , " Oh , those things . They all involved a magazine I was editor of at the time , Ramparts magazine . Those were corporate debts , not my debts . The magazine went broke , it 's not my fault it would n't pay its bills . That 's business , it happens every day . This is different here . I 'm the co-editor and vice president of Scanlan 's magazine , a national publication which I note you sell in the lobby . We have our head office here in New York . Look , my man , just call the office , they 'll take care of it . " And with a flourish he dismissed the man , who , looking puzzled , nonetheless turned and left , after copying down the name , address , and phone number of Scanlan 's . " Hold on to your hat , Clanski , " said Hinckle as soon as the door had shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disavow me , and there 'll be hell to pay . " I N LESS THAN ten minutes , the doorbell rang insistently . This time I found the bellrat , a tall man , and a woman , all of whom pushed past me rudely on being told that I was not Mr. Hinckle . They proceeded first to my bedroom , calling , " Mr. Hinckle , Mr. Hinckle , " as one would call a dog . One of them opened my clothes closet and peered inside . " He 's not there , " I snapped . " 1 sent him to the valet to be dry cleaned . " The procession then wound its way through the living room and into the other rooms , voicing its litany : " Mr. Hinckle , Mr. Hinckle , Mr. Hinckle . " I stood in the living zoom as they returned without their prey . " What 's your name ? " asked the woman , who appeared to be in charge . " Mr. Clancy , " I replied . " Well , you do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I was drawing myself up to full height to huff out a reply , Hinckle suddenly appeared , resplendent in his bath towel . " What 's this , what 's this ? " he clucked . " Who are you ? " snapped the woman sharply . " He 's Hinckle , " screeched the bellrat . The woman looked at Hinckle suspiciously , saying finally , " But where did you come from ? " Hinckle , putting his hands on his hips , looked her full in the eye and said , " Being a gentleman , I would n't have brought it up , but since you did , tell you . I was in the bathroom on the throne when your man here so unceremoniously thrust his head in the door . I guess he 's blind as well as idiotic , since it appears he did n't see me . " The lady and the tall man looked sharply at the bellrat , who cast his eyes down to the floor , a look of chagrin on his twisted face . " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am Mrs. Kenney , the credit manager of this hotel , and I must inform you that in view of your credit record in hotels in New York , you can not charge anything here . I must insist that you pay in full , now , for your charges to date , and that you pay each day in advance , including a deposit for room service . Otherwise , I 'm afraid you 'll have to pay for room service in cash . I 've called Scanlan 's magazine , and they tell me that you 're no longer employed there . They will not pay your bill . " " Why , madam , " said Hinckle evenly , " this is simply preposterous . We are , Mr. Clancy and I , even now on the way to meet with our lawyers to have this matter sorted out . There is a faction at this magazine composed of political radicals , communists if you will , who think they can seize control of a national magazine , one that you carry here in your lobby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt you talked to one of those fools . It 's Saturday , and no one of importance would be there anyway . Surely , Mrs. Kenney , you do n't suppose we would stay here if we had any doubt as to our position at Scanlan 's . I like New York . but I have no desire to see the inside of the Tombs while I am here . " He smiled . " Look , we 'll leave all our clothes and possessions here . Do n't you worry , I assure you we 'll have this whole thing straightened out by Monday , and the magazine will call you , Mrs. Kenney , and vouch for the charges . " The three of them looked at each other . " What do you do ? " the tall man asked me . I bridled ; enough was enough . " I 'll thank you to give me your name and position right now , " I growled . " I 've had enough of this madness . WHO ARE you ? " Mrs. Kenney put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry . Mr. Clancy , " he sniveled . " I did n't mean to annoy you . It 's , it 's just that we get such people in here at times . I 'm sorry . " Mrs. Kenney looked at me and smiled , shaking her head in assent . I smiled back at her ; Hinckle beamed . It was agreed that we could stay till Monday if we left our possessions and did n't charge anything to room service . As they left , Hinckle sighed , " This reminds me of the Marx Brothers ' movie Room Service . All we need is a duck flying around the room . " W E MET at lunch with stockholders who were friendly , and the gist of the advice was for us to pack up and go home . No matter how we reworked the votes on the board , we were beat . We had seen the light at the end of the tunnel , and it was out . We repaired to Elaine 's for succor . It was Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and the near-great . Walter Cronkite was there and all manner of beautiful and important people . I sat glumly while the indefatigable Hinckle , who could turn defeat into good literature , held forth in full throat at the round table with a blow-by-blow account of the battle of the Plaza . The more he evoked laughter , the more dour I became . After all , I was there as a lawyer , and it was unbecoming to be tarred by my clients and treated like some kind of wino , particularly now that it appeared there would be no victory and therefore no spoils . At the very least , I huffed to myself , I should be treated with dignity and not like a common thief who would stoop to stealing lodging . Obsessed with these dark thoughts , 1 brooded in the manner of the Irish . Then , suddenly , unable to hear the opulence , success , and good humor all around me , I left the table in a bitter rage , snarling some garbled excuse . I walked several blocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks in the Oak Room , which I charged to our suite , I was feeling immeasurably better . I had been treated like a gentleman , and I had undertaken a civilized conversation with a chap next to me . I was all right , by God , and to hell with the sorry mess that had brought me here . In this frame of mind . I went upstairs to the suite , and once there I decided it would be amusing to turn all the furniture in the living room upside down so that Hinekle might think himself insane when he came in later . As I sat there with only one small , dim light burning , I surveyed my handiwork with a chuckle . The paintings were all upside down , and all of the furniture was such that the room looked like a forest of legs . This would give him pause , I thought , and laughed just as the piercing wail of fire engines seemed to fill the room . Looking out the window , I saw fire engines with flashing lights all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the door burst open suddenly , and there , framed in the light from the hall , was Hinckle , his face pale and drawn as if he had seen a ghost . " Clanski , " he squeaked , ' you did n't do it , you did n't do it , I was sure that you had . I was positive . " His face brightened and he entered the room . He looked around slowly and then back to me and positively beamed . " Marvelous , justright , excellent work , " he said . " Let 's have a drink . " Hinckle handed me a drink . After we toasted , he put his hand over his heart and said : " Clanski , you just gave me the fright of my life . When you roared out of Elaine 's , you said something about burning down or blowing up the Plaza and getting even with the bastards . When I arrived here and saw all the engines in the street , I was sure in my heart that you 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get the credit for burning down the place . Thank God it was n't true . " He gulped his drink . I looked at Hinckle as if for the first time . " But so what , " I said softly . " You could always go out tomorrow and burn down the Empire State Building or the Waldorf . I mean , why should my burning down the Plaza bother you ? You could eclipse that in no time flat . " He fixed me with a glare . " Because , " he roared , pointing his finger at me as if I were a student in the first grade . " BECAUSE , " he shouted , moving closer , his eye sending out a beam of light , " they only remember the first one . " N MONDAY , Mrs. Kenney came early to tell us that she had checked with Scanlan 's and that they would not pay the bill . Over the weekend , we had taken our possessions out , a piece at a time , a suit here , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were down essentially to a suit in each closet . We were able to persuade her that all would be concluded in our favor before lunch , and that a final treaty was to be signed forthwith by our lawyers at Hawkins and Bernstein . With the suits as security , she let us attend the meeting . As soon as we entered the conference room there , Hinckle picked up the phone and told Mrs. Kenney that we would never return , and that even as he spoke our attorneys were preparing a lawsuit against the Plaza and her goons . The suits in the room , he informed her , were a tip for the maids .
