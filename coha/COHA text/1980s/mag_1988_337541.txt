Eleven a.m. , primary day , Nashua , N.H. Lee Atwater , George Bush 's campaign ! manager , is nearly beside himself with nervous energy . He has five phones going in his room at the Clarion Hotel . Ordinarily a health nut , he has mooched several cigarettes from assistants this morning , and puffs on them rapidly like a teenager learning how to smoke . An underling calls with the latest intelligence from fieldworkers : " Bush , by a point or two . " The news is hardly reassuring , but Atwater keeps talking about a comeback . " One way a candidate , particularly a front runner , gets good , " he says , " is to look into the abyss  --  and realize that he does n't like it one little bit . " <P> During the seven tense days after his crushing defeat in the Iowa caucuses , George Bush gazed deep into the black hole of defeat . The bounce from Iowa allowed Bob Dole to overcome a 20-point deficit in the New Hampshire polls ; he seemed poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary season . But during the final weekend before the New Hampshire vote , Bush 's workers launched a brilliant offensive that rescued their man 's candidacy . " I feel that I have a lot in common with Mark Twain , " said Bush , who appeared more relieved than excited after beating Dole , 37% to 28% . " Reports of my death were greatly exaggerated .

" <P> It was an odd sort of victory for Bush : just a few weeks ago , beating Dole by fewer than 10 points in New Hampshire would have been considered quite limp . But in the supercharged age of nonstop tracking polls , expectations change almost as fast as the fickle fancies of undecided voters . By the weekend before the voting , polls showed Dole pulling ahead . Surveys taken before the final debate and before the last ads were aired reinforced the conventional wisdom that Bush was collapsing . His last-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since he is stronger than Dole in the South , partly because of Ronald Reagan 's popularity there , Bush goes into the Super Tuesday race as the undisputed favorite for the nomination . But Bush 's New Hampshire rebound resolved little ; the only thing settled is that nothing will be settled until at least after the Super Tuesday votes are counted on March 8 , and perhaps not until the end of the primary season in June . Although the winner-take-all nature of most Republican primaries  --  and the lack of a large bloc of uncommitted superdelegates  --  makes a bartered G.O.P. convention far less likely than a bartered Democratic one , the New Hampshire results indicate that both races may go down to the wire .
