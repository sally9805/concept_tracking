" The gladiators are now squared away in the arena , " said Lee Atwater , Mr. Bush ' s campaign manager. // The Rev. Jesse Jackson said he would carry on with his campaign for the Democratic nomination , but the extent of Mr. Dukakis ' s victory over him in the Pennsylvania primary will make it substantially harder for the Chicago clergyman and civil rights leader to mount a real challenge . <> <> Six-Month Campaign Likely // If nothing upsets Mr. Dukakis ' s bandwagon , the 1988 campaign will be the earliest that the Democrats and the Republicans have had a picture of who their standard-bearer will be in the 20 years since primaries have come to dominate the nomination process. // That raises the prospect that the final phase of the primary process will really be the start of what amounts to a six-month general election campaign , with neither side wanting the other to get too much of a head start. // Appearing on the morning news programs of CBS , ABC and NBC , Mr. Bush said " Dukakis doesn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Massachusetts Governor to " fire away " with challenges on his role in the handling of the Iran-contra affair. // Mr. Dukakis obliged . " He sat there and did nothing while we engaged in one of the worst and one of the most misguided adventures in the history of American foriegn policy , " Mr. Dukakis said in an interview in Boston. // " Bush has started to run against us , " said Susan Estrich , Mr. Dukakis ' s campaign manager . She said the Governor would respond wherever necessary , parrying attacks on his lack of foreign policy experience , for example , with references to Mr. Bush ' s role in the Reagan Administration ' s relationship with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega , the Panamanian leader . <> <> Trade Bill Issue Raised // Mr. Dukakis also demanded today that the Vice President explain where he stands on President Reagan ' s threat to veto the trade bill because it contains a provision requiring American corporations to give workers 60 days ' notice of plant closings . " Doesn ' t he think it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dukakis asked // The sudden and early way in which the general election contest has come into focus is a particular irony given the chaos , competition and hand-wringing that permeated both races just a few months ago. // The outcome of Tuesday ' s primary in Pennsylvania had been clear for several days , and Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis had begun campaigning against each other a few days earlier . Mr. Bush appeared in Pittsburgh on Monday , just hours ahead of Mr. Dukakis , and attacked the Democrats as weak on military affairs . Mr. Dukakis , in turn , talked about the economic suffering of western Pennsylvania and the shaky ethics of an Administration that would have Edwin Meese 3d as Attorney General. // Although the Vice President ' s staff members said they expected Mr. Dukakis to be their opponent in the fall , Mr. Bush often adds remarks like " throw in Jackson " as a possible challenger , remarks that seem designed to remind voters of the powerful role attained in the party by Mr. Jackson. // Mr. Bush , running essentially unopposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania primary , putting him over the top in the number needed to win the Republican nomination in New Orleans next August . He now has 1 , 156 delegates , 17 more than needed to nominate. // Mr. Dukakis , who defeated Mr. Jackson by more than 2 to 1 here in their first head-to-head contest , won 163 of the 178 Democratic delegates at stake in the Pennsylvania primary . The Governor now has a total of 1 , 255 delegates ; he needs 2 , 081 to win his party ' s nomination at the convention in Atlanta next July . <> <> Tide Running Dukakis ' s Way // But the political tide is running his way , and it would take a much stronger showing by Mr. Jackson through the remaining primaries to stop him now. // Mr. Jackson ran what even his staff members conceded was a lackluster campaign here , winning only 14 of the 178 delegates at stake . Turnout among both blacks and whites was well below that in past Pennsylvania primaries. // In addition to the delegates he won in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 additional party leaders who will be delegates to the convention . Among them was Representative Lee H. Hamilton , the Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the House committee that investigated the Iran-contra affair. // Indiana , Ohio and the District of Columbia hold their primary contests next Tuesday. // With the expectation that they will win the District of Columbia and lose the two others , Mr. Jackson ' s advisers are saying their one remaining hope for victory in a major contest will be in California on the final day of the primary season , June 7 . <> <> An Air of Resignation // But they spoke with an air of resignation , often saying that the main purpose of the campaign now was to try to win commitments from Governor Dukakis on crucial issues and tune him up for the fall campaign against Mr. Bush. // Both the Governor and the Vice President have unresolved party problems . Mr. Dukakis must still fend off Mr. Jackson ' s challenge through the final primaries , and then bring him and his supporters to back his campaign. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will soon receive help from that quarter . He spoke about the campaign today with both Mr. Reagan and Pat Robertson , the former television evangelist who has suspended his Presidential campaign , and each pledged their support. // In campaign appearances before the primary voting on Tuesday and on television shows this morning , Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis began aiming their political guns at each other. // In many ways , Monday in Pittsburgh seemed more like the first day of the general election than the day before a primary .

But 3 in 10 favored Mr. Bush . Mr. Atwater said that , nationwide , Mr. Bush would have to capture about a third of the Democrats that Mr. Reagan won in his 1984 landslide to win a narrow victory this year. // Pennsylvania was Mr. Dukakis ' s most convincing victory .
