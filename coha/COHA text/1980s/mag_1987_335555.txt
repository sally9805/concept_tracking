As the pressure builds on U.S. companies to leave South Africa , the caravan of departing corporations grows steadily longer . More than 100 U.S. firms have quit the land of apartheid during the past 2 1/2 years , and last week three big names  --  Citicorp , Ford and ITT  --  joined the crowd at the exits . The magnitude of the American pullout has raised some crucial and highly controversial questions : What happens to the businesses that U.S. companies abandon ? Are South Africa 's blacks better or worse off ? Has divestiture had any impact on the country 's economic and political climate ? <P> On the surface , not much has changed . Familiar American offerings , from Coca-Cola to cars made with General Motors parts , are still available , sold now by the firms that bought former subsidiaries of U.S. companies . Early opponents of divestiture were concerned that the departures of American firms would mean a dramatic loss of jobs for black workers , but that fear has so far $ proved unjustified . However , advocates of divestiture who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , even slightly , its policy of apartheid have been sorely disappointed . <P> Whatever change is taking place , it seemed to be accelerating last week . Ford , which has manufactured cars in South Africa for 63 years , hopes to donate most of its holdings to its predominantly black work force . ITT sold off its small automobile-brake plant . Citicorp , the lone American bank left in South Africa , will sell its 29-year-old subsidiary to First National , the country 's largest commercial bank . <P> These and other departing companies have been under enormous pressure to get out of South Africa . Shareholder groups threatened to dump their stock , while states , cities and counties vowed to deny them contracts and customers pledged to boycott their products . South Africa 's political unrest and sluggish economy have also been deterrents to doing business . The resolve of some firms to remain in South Africa weakened two weeks ago when the Rev. Leon Sullivan , who in 1977 wrote a widely accepted set of principles governing responsible investment in South Africa , advocated total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African businesses to be sold only to those buyers who would promote black ownership . <P> So far , however , most American firms have sold their holdings to local , white-controlled firms . Buyers include giant conglomerates like the Premier Group , which purchased Dow Chemical 's subsidiary , and smaller firms like Northern Engineering , which acquired Eaton 's operations . Other U.S. divisions have been sold to the white South Africans who managed the subsidiary or to foreign firms . Only a few companies , including Eastman Kodak , have completely shut down their operations . <P> Rarest of all are the deals in which the companies have sold to blacks . Coca-Cola was the first American firm to do so ; in March 8,500 of its wholesalers and retailers , 60% of whom are nonwhite , bought one-third of Coke 's South African subsidiary . Ford 's proposed sell-off could be another such case . The carmaker is negotiating with its employees to put its interests into a trust that represents the company 's 4,500 workers , 70% of whom are black .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
