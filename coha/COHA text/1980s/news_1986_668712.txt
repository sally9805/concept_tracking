The increasing trend of financial stress among farmers in recent years apparently extends beyond smaller , heavily indebted farms to at least some relatively large , so-called solvent farms . The trend was noted in a recent study of farm bankruptcies in Missouri by Stephen Matthews , a University of Missouri-Columbia agricultural law professor . The study comes at a time when a survey by Congress ' General Accounting Office indicates that about 37 , 000 borrowers who owe almost $5 billion to the federal Farmers Home Administration are likely to fail . That ' s out of a total 270 , 000 borrowers from the FmHA , often called the " lender of last resort . " The Missouri study found 1 , 672 farm bankruptcies in that state , starting with 114 in 1981 . The trend increased to 245 bankruptcies the next year , 319 in 1983 , 459 in 1984 , and 535 last year . " Our studies show financial stress is found even among some of Missouri ' s large and solvent farms , " Matthews reported . " Of the 174 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 54 farms with net worth in excess of $200 , 000 each . " Matthews explained that when farmers file under Chapters 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act , they are proposing a business reorganization plan . They sometimes restructure existing debts and even sell off some assets . If the plan is approved by creditors or the bankruptcy judge , the debtors must live up to the terms of the reorganization plan . This process differs from a Chapter 7 liquidation , in which the debtors go out of business and their excess debts are discharged . " The 1 , 672 Missouri farm bankruptcies from 1981 through 1985 represent 1. 5 percent of Missouri ' s total farms if you stick with the census definition of a farm , " Matthews said . ( The census defines a farm as a unit of acreage that is capable of producing at least $1 , 000 of farm products annually . Under that definition , Missouri has 115 , 000 farms . ) " But if you think in terms of commercial farms  --  those that sell $40 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census would show about 23 , 000 such farms ( in Missouri ) , " Matthews said . " The total number of bankruptcies would represent about 7 percent of these operations . " His study indicated that farmers liquidating under Chapter 7 had an average debt-to-asset ratio of 2. 19 . That means that for every $1 of assets , these farmers had $2. 19 of debt . The average debt-to-asset ratio for those Missouri farmers filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 was 1. 10 . Eighty percent of thse farmers seeking to reorganize had assets greater than $100 , 000 . The study found that total debt represented by farmers declaring bankruptcy ( 1 , 396 ) from 1981 through May , 1985 , was $531. 3 million . Of that total , 73 percent of the debt was secured and the rest was unsecured . " If all these 1 , 396 farm bankruptcies ( Chapters 7 , 11 , and 13 ) were liquidated , we ' d be left with $158. 7 million of debt unpaid , " Matthews said . " None of the unsecured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , about 30 percent of debts owed by these bankrupt farmers are unpayable . That unpaid debt represents about 2 percent of total Missouri farm debt of $7 billion . " Those unpaid debts come out of the economy somewhere . Creditors , including agribusinesses , lose money . So do communities. "
