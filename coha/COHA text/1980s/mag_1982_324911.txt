Elizabeth Taylor Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Burton Warner , 49 , did it again last week . Or rather , she undid it again . Confirming rumors that her seventh marriage to her sixth husband was shaky , Liz and Republican Senator John Warner , 54 , said they would seek a legal separation after five years of marriage . Warner joins an illustrious cast from Liz 's previous marital flings : Hotelier Conrad Hilton Jr . in 1950 ; British Actor Michael Wilding in 1952 ; Producer Mike Todd in 1957 ; Singer Eddie Fisher in 1959 ; and Actor Richard Burton in 1964 and again in 1975 . In the early stages of Liz and John 's relationship , all was bliss : he was the silver-haired political newcomer , she was his superstar hustings-mate and bubbling party-circuit matron . But when she detoured to her Broadway triumph in The Little Foxes , it was reported that those violet eyes began to wander . At one point , she was linked to Foxes Producer Zev Bufman , 51 . Bufman , married to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike some of Taylor 's splits , this one , says her spokeswoman , Chen Sam , seems free of friction : " Each party accepts this change in their relationship with sadness but with no bitterness between them . " <P> <P> The afternoon sun setting on the Bernini columns that line St. Peter 's Square , the sea effaces and outstretched arms , the beaming man in white reaching out to touch those near by . Then the hand in the air , the gun , the explosion , the shouts of disbelief . Even now , those haunting images of the attempt on Pope John Paul II 's life last May linger on . For Josef Hartmann , 60 , the horror would evolve into an even stronger , more lasting vision . A civil servant from Momlingen , West Germany , on a tour of Italy with his wife Erna , Hartmann was in St. Peter 's Square taking pictures of the Pontiff from behind , when shots rang out from the Browning 9-mm semiautomatic pistol of Mehmet Ali Agca . Two weeks later , Hartmann and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfgang , 33 , a schoolteacher . Wolfgang immediately spotted what his parents had missed : perhaps the most chilling photographic record of the attempted assassination . <P> <P> Looking like the shy and slightly awkward newlyweds they are , Alexei Semyonov , 25 , and his wife , Liza Alexeyeva , 26 , were reunited in Boston last week after 3 years of separation . Alexei , the stepson of Soviet Dissident and 1975 Nobel Peace Prizewinner Andrei Sakharov , 60 , and Liza , fell in love when they were students in Moscow . Alexei emigrated to the U.S. in 1978 and arranged a proxy marriage with Liza last June . The Soviet government , however , refused to permit Liza to join her husband . Only after a much publicized , 17-day hunger strike by Sakharov and his wife-now living in relative exile in Gorky by the Volga River-did the Soviets relent . Alexei and Liza now are settled in their own home in Waltham , Mass . " Our joy , " says she , " is darkened by the uncertain fate of the Sakharovs . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lucky ones .
