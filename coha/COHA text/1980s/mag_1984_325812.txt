The government takes action to quiet opposition protests <P> Groups of up to 150 people began to gather ominously in the Plaza Dos de Mayo in downtown Lima last Thursday at the headquarters of various left-wing political and union organizers . Over loudspeakers , union leaders exhorted the crowds with revolutionary slogans . Leaflets passed out by the Peruvian Communist Party protested hunger and misery and stated the party 's demands for job stability and the control of fuel and food prices . In one shantytown south of the city , small bands of youths flung rocks at bus windows . Almost all of Peru 's privately owned buses stayed off the roads , making it difficult for many people to get to work . At least one-third of the work force in 16 cities decided to stay home . <P> The presence of 8,000 riot-gear-equipped police in Lima made it clear that the government of President Fernando Belande Terry was taking the 24-hour general strike very seriously . Early Thursday morning , police pointed their shotguns at drivers of trucks with space available who tried to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect rocks or debris were chased , beaten with nightsticks and sometimes shoved into police vans . Jorge del Prado , 73 , a senator and leader of the Peruvian Communist Party , was struck in the chest by a tear-gas canister fired at close range . Despite the numerous clashes around the country however , the day 's toll was miraculously low : none dead and about 50 injured , few seriously . <P> Trying to avert the strike , Belaunde , 72 , called for a national three-day suspension of liberties , prohibiting demonstrations and meetings , and gave police broader powers of arrest . This kept disturbances to a minimum . But perhaps the most important deterrent to a larger strike came three days earlier , when Belande announced the removal of Finance Minister Carlos Rodriguez Pastor . Rodriguez Pastor had engineered an austerity program under which the country was beginning to strain . His replacement , Jos Benavides Muoz , was expected to look for economic alternatives , but the strikers remained unimpressed . <P> Peru 's economy began to slide in 1980 under the pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper and lead exports . Belande further undermined the economy by borrowing excessively from other countries and failing to curb money-losing state enterprises . The gross domestic product declined 12% last year , the worst performance in Latin America . Inflation hit 125% , unemployment 8.3% and underemployment 51% . The Peruvian sol declined 130% against the dollar during 1983 . The country 's foreign debt is $13 billion , about two-thirds of its gross domestic production . Belande put Peru on the austerity program in 1982 , but so far he has resisted pressure from the International Monetary Fund for a major devaluation this year , opting instead for minidevaluations almost daily .
