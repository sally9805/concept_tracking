NEW YORK  --  Bond prices edged higher yesterday , buoyed by continued optimism that interest rates are heading lower . Meanwhile , Treasury bills dropped to their lowest levels since late last year and one big bank , Chase Manhattan Bank , lowered its prime lending rate to 10 1/2% from 11% . Other banks are expected to follow Chase ' s lead soon . Despite those developments , trading was quiet as many investors remained on the sidelines , trying to determine whether interest rates will drop much further . " It was a very dull day , " said Owen Williams , a trading manager at Salomon Brothers Inc . But many traders said that market sentiment remains bullish because of perceptions that this week ' s slate of economic reports , all due Friday , will provide fresh evidence of a slowing economy , prompting the Fed to ease policy further . The Treasury ' s benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 1/4 of a point , or $2. 50 for each $1 , 000 face amount . The yield on the bond fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier for the second consecutive session . Bond traders said the inability of the benchmark 30-year bond to slip below 8% indicates that the market is consolidating at present levels following recent gains . The last time that a bellwether 30-year bond traded below 8% was April 8 , 1987 , when the closing yield was 7. 89% . At the government ' s weekly auction , short-term interest rates fell . The average discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7. 76% at yesterday ' s auction , the lowest since the average of 7. 54% at the auction Nov. 7 , 1988 . The average discount rate on six-month Treasury bills was 7. 50% , the lowest since the average auction rate of 7. 48% on Oct. 31 , 1988 . Those rates were much lower than at last week ' s auction , when the average discount rate was 7. 96% on three-month bills and 7. 63% on six-month bills . The Federal Reserve ' s execution of overnight matched sale-purchase agreements , a trading operation used to drain reserves from the banking system , had a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sign that the newly perceived target for the federal funds rate is 9 1/4% . While that is down from the recent target of about 9 1/2% , it was somewhat disappointing because investors were hoping that the rate would decline to about 9% . The fed funds rate is what banks charge on overnight loans to each other . The operation " made it clear that the funds rate is 9 1/4%  --  not lower , not higher , " says Philip Braverman , executive director of Irving Securities Inc . " But that in no way refutes the assumption that a further easing step is coming relatively soon , perhaps as early as Friday . " Treasury Securities Treasury securities ended as much as 1/4 higher in thin trading . The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 109 22/32 , up from 109 13/32 Friday . Its yield slid to 8. 01% from 8. 03% . The Treasury ' s 10-year notes were quoted late at 107 21/32 , up from 107 13/32 Friday , while the yield fell to 7. 97% from 8. 01% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to sell tomorrow were quoted in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7. 90% . In the agency market , the Student Loan Marketing Association priced about $450 million of floating-rate notes due Jan. 11 , 1990 . The notes were priced at par to yield a rate equal to 0. 80 percentage point above the bond equivalent yield of the 91-day Treasury bill auction rate . The interest rate on the notes will be reset on the day following each weekly Treasury bill auction . Here are details of yesterday ' s auction : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor ' s return while lower bidding widens it . The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
