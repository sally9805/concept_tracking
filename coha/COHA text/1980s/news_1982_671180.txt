In a sense , personal computers are at the fore of this trend , as indeed they should be . Realistically speaking , the lifespan of a personal computer today is probably less than five years - simply because of technological obsolescence . Microcomputers are likely to be disposed of not because of operating failure , but because newer versions do so much more so much better and cost so much less for what they do that they simply can ' t be resisted. // So why bother with upkeep ? Actually , there ' s a very good reason for preventive maintenance . It ' s known as avoiding headaches . With a little extra care , you should be able to expect largely trouble-free operation from your personal computer. // The maintenance of a personal computer begins as soon as you plug it in . Unlike mechanical devices such as can openers and bicycles , which wear down with age and are thus increasingly prone to bits-andpieces failure as time goes on , electronic equipment usually fails within the first 24 hours of use or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing you should do with a new personal computer is turn it on and leave it on for two days straight . You don ' t have to sit in front of it through a marathon game session . The crucial element is simply that the computer is left turned on , a process referred to as burning in. // Most manufacturers will burn in their equipment before it leaves the plant . Even so , an extra precautionary burn in on your part uses hardly any electricity and insures that if a component failure does occur at this stage you are well covered by the manufacturer ' s warranty. // After initial component failure , probably the greatest problem apt to beset personal computers is dust . A dust cover for the computer may seem about as important as a tea cozy in this day and age . But as far as lifespan of your computer is concerned , it can make a difference comparable to that between keeping your car in a garage and letting it sit outside at the seashore. // A good dust cover should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit as useful as the ones commercially available when it comes to keeping dust away from the sensitive keyboard and disk drives . But don ' t merely drape a piece of clingy plastic sheeting over your machine . Computers tend to be susceptible to damage by static electricity . You don ' t want to eliminate the dust problem by introducing a static problem in its stead . If you have a separate printer , give it a cover as well . It ' s not as prone to dust problems as the disk drives are , but dirt will eventually gum up any mechanical device. // EVEN well-protected floppy disk drives will need cleaning . The read/write heads on them will build up an accumulation of magnetic oxides from the disks themselves . To clean the heads , you will need one of the numerous kits available , containing special cleaning diskettes and fluid . All you do is saturate the cleaning pads of these special disks with the fluid and insert them in the drive . Turn on the drive , and the machine does the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use will extend the life of both the drive and your software disks. // Lint-free wipers are also usually available at your local computer store . These can be used in conjunction with an antistatic cleaning fluid to clean the keyboard every couple of weeks . A quick wipe-off of the whole cabinet while you ' re at it may not be necessary , but if you use your computer daily , it certainly can ' t do any harm either. // Low-priced computers so constituted that game and program cartridges plug right into the console present another potential problem . Suppose a software cartridge you ' ve used many times before suddenly fails to perform properly . Suppose the display is garbled or the game simply fails to proceed correctly . In that case , there ' s a good chance those gold-plated fingers , or teeth , by means of which the cartridge plugs into the computer , have become fouled up . Since it is these fingers that make the crucial contact between cartridge and computer , dirt , dust and grime can impede a proper electrical connection. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer such as the Texas Instruments TI 99/4A , in which the fingers are more or less sealed off from the outside world and a flap on the computer port automatically seals off the plug when a cartridge is not in place . However , computers like the Commodore VIC-20 use cartridges with exposed pins that can become gummed up. // The pins are easy enough to clean . Simply wipe the teeth gently with a lint-free rag soaked in one of the many cleaning fluids available for the purpose . The primary ingredient of most of these cleaning solutions is denatured ethyl alcohol , so you can simply use that if you happen to have a bottle of it around. // The last bit of maintenance pertaining to a personal computer is actually a transportation detail . Personal computers are far more tolerant of being knocked about than traditional computers are . Nevertheless , if you ' re packing up your computer and its components to transport them somewhere , it would be a good idea to use the original carton with its complete collection of modern shockabsorbing devices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas tree this year , put aside the boxes it came in before you throw out those mounds of Christmas wrappings. //
