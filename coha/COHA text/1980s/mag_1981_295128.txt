JULY 'S PEOPLE <P> by Nadine Gordimer <P> Viking ; 160 pages ; $10.95 <P> This terse novel is set in a future that may be inevitable . Author Nadine Gordimer , 57 , imagines a time when the blacks of her native South Africa finally move in force against the ruling white minority . The cities go up in flames , the airports and other routes of escape are cut off . People who probably did not belong in the country in the first place now find that they can not get out at all . <P> Among them are Bamford and Maureen Smales , a liberal Johannesburg couple with three small children . As the rioting spreads , they turn to July , the black man who has been their servant for 15 years . He piles them into a van and guides them to his ancestral village , nearly 400 miles away . This " crash from the suburb to the wilderness " takes three torturous days and nights to accomplish . <P> Then difficulties begin in earnest . Although their children slip easily into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to adjust to the " habitation of mud houses . " Food is scarce , sanitation minimal , and disease threatens with every drink from the nearby river . They fear betrayal . July can apparently keep the members of his extended family quiet , but perhaps " he could not prevent other people , living scattered round about , who knew the look of every thornbush , from discovering there were thornbushes that overgrew a white man 's car , and passing on that information to any black army patrol . " <P> Hardest of all is their total dependence on July himself . They owe him their lives , yet the Smaleses find it galling that the servant has become their master . He insists on keeping the keys to the van ; they do not want to trust him with this power over their fates . He still maintains the routine of serving them , bringing them tea in the morning and shopping for supplies ; they wonder if this behavior is not reproachful , a way of setting them apart from the life of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily routines , and her husband is powerless , " an architect lying on a bed in a mud hut , a man without a vehicle . " <P> The fact that the Smaleses have supported black independence does not make their ordeal any easier . They fiddle constantly with a radio they salvaged from their home , hoping for news of some kindt expecting to hear the " burst of martial music " that will announce the final success of the revolution . Their principles and fears are at cross-purposes . They know which side is right , and they also know that it is the one that will assuredly kill them : " They had fled the fighting in the streets , the danger for their children , the necessity to defend their lives in the name of ideals they did n't share in a destroyed white society they did n't believe in . " Whatever happens , the Smaleses can not go home again .
