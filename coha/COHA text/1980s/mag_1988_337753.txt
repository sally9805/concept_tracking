The 1988 campaign proceeds in a dreamy weightlessness . Multiple images of multiple candidates float through the night air  --  the bright auditorium , the shiny " hopefuls . " The audience almost unconsciously makes a ritual calculation . They do not judge the men on the issues , really , so much as on the unarticulated question of gravitas . Which of the candidates has the weight , the size , the something , to become President ? <P> Gravitas is a mystery , just as the presidency itself is something of a mystery . Gravitas is a secret of character and grasp and experience , a force in the eye , the voice , the bearing . Sometimes  --  as with , say , Winston Churchill  --  it announces itself as eloquence , and sometimes it proclaims itself as a silence , a suspension full of either menace or Zen . The Japanese believe a man 's gravitas emanates from densities of the unspoken . <P> Sicilians speak of a " man of respect , " a phrase suggesting , at its darkest reach , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to enforce that respect . Gravitas is a phenomenon of power , but the forms and styles of power are various . Dictators are forever strutting the tinhorn 's impersonation of gravitas . Brute power is only one of the cruder types , and it is sometimes subdued by other forms : a moral gravitas , for example . Martin Luther King Jr . brought his gravitas to bear against men of power who were morally vacant . Gravitas may be aggression , but it may express itself otherwise , as something withheld , as a dignity and forbearance . <P> A peculiarly powerful form of gravitas may arise out of suffering . It draws its authority not only from the redemptive example of Christ but also from Greek tragedy : the terrible moral power of woe . Mother Teresa has that gravitas of the redemptive . Whole cultures may be judged weighty or weightless by the calibration of suffering . Russian history sometimes seems an entire universe of gravitas : always there is the heavy Slavic woe , the encroaching dark and metaphysical winter . <P> And yet Mikhail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieves his effect precisely by reversing the Slavic inevitabilities : opening the windows , airing out the old system . The earlier generations of Soviets ( Leonid Brezhnev , for example ) sat upon the world 's stage like dark boulders . Weight is not enough . Gravitas is weight with complexities of life and intelligence in it . <P> One can make a game of gravitas : who has it , who does not . Gorbachev , surely . Pope John Paul II . Jimmy Carter did not . Nor did Gerald Ford . Richard Nixon displayed a bizarre and complex gravitas that destroyed itself in sinister trivialities . Does Ronald Reagan have gravitas ? In some ways , Reagan seems a perfect expression of the anti-gravitas America of the late ' 80s , a place that can seem weightless and evanescent , as forgetful as a television screen . Gravitas , a deep moral seriousness , is not necessarily the virtue for an electronic age . And yet Reagan possesses a gravitas of authenticity . In any case , lame ducks always suffer from diminished gravitas . People do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of power lay ahead . <P> Margaret Thatcher undoubtedly has gravitas . One thinks of Barbara Jordan as a figure of gravitas ( the voice , the steady , strong intelligence ) .
