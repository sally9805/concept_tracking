When Composer-Lyricist Stephen Sondheim and Director-Librettist James Lapine completed their Pulitzer-prizewinning musical Sunday in the Park with George in 1984 , they began exploring two new ideas : to create from scratch a classic myth or fairy tale for the stage and to bring together Lucy , Ralph Kramden and other memorable sitcom characters in a single overlapping story for a TV special . Eventually the two plans sort of fused . Instead of the sitcom figures , the authors decided to jumble larkingly together the characters and archetypes popularized by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm . The strikingly original yet completely accessible result opened on Broadway last week . <P> Into the Woods is a musical fairy tale in which Jack , of beanstalk fame ; Little Red Ridinghood ; Cinderella , Rapunzel and their respective princes ; Sleeping Beauty ; Snow White  --  and , of course , a wicked witch and a menacing giant  --  are living out their stories in the same forest at the same time , bumping into each other and entangling one another 's narratives . As funny as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Forum , as musical as his A Little Night Music , as morally inflamed as his Sweeney Todd , yet more forgiving and affirmative than anything he has written before , Into the Woods is the best show yet from the most creative mind in the musical theater today . It is also that joyous rarity , a work of sophisticated artistic ambition and deep political purpose that affords nonstop pleasure . <P> Broadway could not need it more . In recent years the musical , which once planted America 's theatrical flag from Rome to Tokyo , has been subjected to a kind of reverse Monroe Doctrine . The Great White Way 's four hottest sellers  --  Cats , Me and My Girl , Starlight Express and Les Miserables  --  come from London ( Les Mis originated in Paris ) . So does Phantom of the Opera , which opens in January but already boasts a $10.5 million advance sale . During the 1980s , dozens of homegrown musicals have come and gone , some losing as much as $7 million . <P> Into the Woods can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , imitation is a less viable route to success in the theater than in prime-time TV . For another , only Sondheim is Sondheim . Says Composer- Lyricist Jerry Herman , author of La Cage aux Folles and Hello , Dolly : " We would all agree that Steve is the genius of the group , the one who keeps on taking the musical theater to new places . " What Into the Woods does , gloriously , is make the case for what musicals might be , blending innovation and old-fashioned storytelling into an elixir of delight . It makes audiences think of Freud and Jung , of dark psychological thickets and sudden clearings of enlightenment , even as they roar with laughter . Its basic insight , plainly influenced by the revisionist scholarship of Bruno Bettelheim , is that at heart , most fairy tales are about the loving yet embattled relationship between parents and children . Almost everything that goes wrong  --  which is to say , almost everything that can  --  arises from a failure of parental or filial duty , despite the best intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
