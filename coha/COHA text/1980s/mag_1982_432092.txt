 | For the two years that New York City perched on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s , each day began the same way for every New York Times reporter covering the story ? with a telephone call from Felix G. Rohatyn . The articulate investment banker from Lazard Freres &; Co. was Gov . Hugh L. Carey 's principal adviser in the crisis , and Rohatyn realized right from the start that he would have to control the coverage of the controversy if he was going to determine its outcome . He also understood exactly how to do that . The first half of his daily telephone call would always be on the record ? almost invariably providing enough fresh information and quotable quotes to put Rohatyn and the reporter on the front page of the next day 's Times . The second half would be off the record ? so the reporter would know exactly what was most important about the story , and Rohatyn would never be quoted out of context . It was a masterly performance . Genuine Newsmakers : Rohatyn is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a special appreciation of how the press works . There are dozens of others like him across the country , prominent people who revel in dealing directly with reporters , instead of insulating themselves behind a wall of press agents . They are a diverse group . Some , like Democratic Party power broker Robert S. Strauss , Chicago civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson and White House national-security adviser William P. Clark , are basically politicians . Others , like theatrical impresario Joseph Papp and New York City Opera general director Beverly Sills , inhabit the world of the arts . A few , like Rohatyn , come from Wall Street . All are genuine newsmakers . But as one leading New York editor puts it : " There 's a very thin line between manipulating the public sensibility and simply doing something and being the magnet . " Within this group , Rohatyn is the smoothest ; Papp , the frankest ; Clark , the subtlest ; Jackson , the most aggressive ; Sills , the best liked , and Strauss , the most manipulative . While they all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crucial impression that he enjoys the company of reporters . ( " I like talking to them , " says Rohatyn . ) They also share a trait that is probably the single most important prerequisite for good relations with the press : supreme self-confidence . " The press has an animal instinct that smells fear , " says Strauss . Thus , he reasons , when it comes to press relations , " you do better if you do it yourself . " Media handlers tend to be extremely well informed ? or , at the very least , great gossips . They always return a reporter 's telephone calls , they commit deadlines to memory and they never forget that they ca n't speak the same way on television as they would if they were being quoted in print . " If you had a camera with you I 'd be talking differently , " Jesse Jackson told NEWSWEEK 'S Lea Donosky . " There are things you might say on TV with a smile which in print seem offensive and look harsh , " says Rohatyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed media that he was asked by ABC News to play the part of the " guest " in the dress rehearsal of the network 's new Sunday interview program , " This Week with David Brinkley . " " I do n't prepare , " boasts Strauss , " because you get overprepared . " Tepid Bath ' : As well as being technically sophisticated , media handlers are also invariably quotable . Rohatyn in particular is a master of the kind of quasi-apocalyptic phrasing that reporters adore . For example , just when he was starting to despair of his ability to convince people that New York City really would suffer permanent damage ifit went bankrupt , he came up with a simile that captured the public 's imagination : " Bankruptcy is like someone stepping into a tepid bath and slashing his wrists ? you might not feel yourself dying , but that 's what would happen . " Sometimes , Rohatyn says , " it 's really important to take an abstract concept and bring it to the realm of reality with imagery . In a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beverly Sills is another kind of communicator , but an equally effective one . " If I call her up and ask her a question , she will talk for 45 minutes without being asked another question , " says New York Times music critic Donal Henahan . " She never has any problem about what she means . She never fumbles for explanations . " With such well-honed skills , it is hardly surprising that media handlers generally attract an overwhelmingly favorable press . ' But to solidify their relationships with reporters , they often go one step further ? they cultivate an " atmosphere of intimacy " that one Washington correspondent de-@#  | scribes as the ultimate form of flattery . To achieve such intimacy , each of them has his own idiosyncratic technique . Rohatyn will often go off the record to convey the impression that even his deepest secrets are available to the very discreet . Sills and Papp take the opposite tack ? they put practically everything on the record , relying on their interviewer to protect them . " Do n't abuse our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time an hour earlier . If Papp has known a reporter longer , there will be other intimations of affection . Says one longtime Papp observer : " If you talk to Joe , the characteristic experience is the most sophisticated and charming smile ? as if to insinuate , You and I really understand what 's at the heart of this event ' . " Reporters like to be entertained as much as anybody else , and media handlers like Papp and Sills understand the value of putting on a performance for them . " There 's no one in New York as unbuttoned as Joe Papp , " says one veteran theater critic . " He invites you into his midst . " Sills does the same . Boston Globe music critic Richard Dyer was delighted when the former diva let him follow her around for a whole day . " She did n't bar me from anything , " he says . She also knows how to disarm critics with honesty . Dyer remembered seeing Sills sing Tosca ? a very demanding role ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , was it true that she sang eight of those in seven days ? And she said , Honey , why do you think I 'm finished at 50 ? " ' Strauss 's approach is more unorthodox , but equally effective : one of his favorite tools is abuse . When Albert R. Hunt of the Wall Street Journal was preparing a profile of him , Strauss insisted that Hunt spend the night at his home in Dallas . At five minutes to 6 the next morning , Strauss burst into the reporter 's room with a breakfast tray . As he placed the food on Hunt 's bed , he shouted to his wife : " Helen , get a picture . I know we can buy this sumbitch cheap ! " During the same trip , Hunt and Strauss made a $20 bet on a football game . Hunt won the bet , but Strauss did n't see him again until the reporter 's profile ? which turned out to be favorable ? appeared in print . When Hunt ran into Strauss that day , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish , the Texan pulled out a $20 bill . As he thrust it into Hunt 's pocket , he announced for all to hear : " That was one hell of a piece this morning . " " Nobody else could get away with it , " says Hunt . " But it 's funny when he does it . " Laid Back : Coming on strong is hardly the only way to win over the press ; in fact , unless practiced by a master , it can easily backfire . William Clark 's first fourteen months in the Reagan Administration are proof that what one reporter calls a " calculatingly laid back " approach to the press can be just as successful as Strauss 's goodnatured bullying . A former California Supreme Court Justice who was named Deputy Secretary of State early last year , Clark became the object of nearly universal derision after his first appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . During four hours of testimony , he failed to identify the prime ministers of South Africa and Zimbabwe , professed total ignorance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detente came from reading NEWSWEEK and Time . REAGAN CHOOSES NITWIT AS MINISTER , shouted a headline in one Amsterdam newspaper , and American diplomatic correspondents agreed . Only longtime Reagan-watcher Lou Cannon hinted at the turnaround to come . Writing in The Washington Post just after Reagan 's Inauguration , Cannon pointed out that " Wherever @# he has gone , Clark has been controversial at first but has wound up making friends in unexpected quarters . One reason is his sense of humor , which surfaced recently when he said that his foreign-policy experience had been limited to 72 hours in Santiago ' . " Unlike such extroverts as Rohatyn , Jackson or Papp , Clark rarely initiates a call to a reporter ; nonetheless he is anonymously accessible . " Early on , you could pick up the phone and . . . ask for Judge Clark , and half the time he 'd come on the phone , " says one reporter . " That 's unheard of at that high a level in the State Department . " Agrees another State Department veteran : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as he could . He did n't try to pretend he knew anything more than he did , but what he did talk about ? always on background ? was honest . " Good relations with his subordinates also burnished his reputation . " He 's made a lot of friends there , " says one regular at State . " That 's part of the secret to good press relations : anecdotes from the bureaucracy have made him look good . " The result of all this was what one diplomatic correspondent in Washington calls the greatest public-relations turnaround he has witnessed in twenty years . " It was a marvelous job , " says the correspondent . " For a guy who started so poorly , he certainly has gotten a remarkably good press . " When Clark moved to the White House last January to replace Richard V. Allen as the President 's national-security adviser , columnist Joseph Kraft noted that the appointment had been greeted with " cheers fit for a Super Bowl champion . " " An effective manager , willing learner and invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An upgrading of the national security assistant 's job , " declared the Wall Street Journal . Public Image : Clark 's expertise in press relations had been carefully cultivated over the years . He had extensive practice dealing with reporters long before his arrival in Washington . As Ronald Reagan 's chief of staff during his first term as governor of California , Clark spent " a lot of time talking to the political guys from the Sacramento bureaus of the big papers in California , " recalls a veteran San Francisco political reporter . " He would also be talking to the San Francisco bureau people for The New York Times , and for Time and for NEWSWEEK . Being a Supreme Court Justice in a big state like California , it 's a tricky thing to start taking calls from reporters , but Clark would always take them . " Equally important , he knew how to handle himself . " He was guarded about what he 'd talk about , " the reporter says . " He did n't hesitate to say to you , Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he managed to convey to you the appearance that he wanted to help . That of course is the fundamental of his successful public image in Washington . " Most successful media handlers have had long experience with the press . Joe Papp , in  | fact , once published a neighborhood newspaper of his own in Brooklyn ? when he was 12 . " I had this guy who had a typewriter ? an older guy who used to type it up for me , " the producer says . " One page , and we 'd make about 30 carbon copies . We 'd give it away . I cut the word Press ' out of a headline in the Daily News and put it in my hat . " Papp has since made himself the living symbol of his New York Shakespeare Festival . That role first brought him to prominence in 1959 when he manipulated the press brilliantly in a successful battle against Robert Moses , the legendary New York power broker who tried to banish Papp 's free Shakespeare presentation from Central Park . In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis- ease that he and others like him dread most : overexposure . " If I do too many things , I 'm not as effective , " he says . " I 'm very select now in what I do . " Still , Papp could n't resist organizing a belated effort by prominent New York actors to prevent the demolition of two historic Times Square theaters that fell under the wrecker 's ball last month to make way for a new hotel . He negotiated his own arrest ? for trespassing ? in advance with police , and when the paddy wagons arrived he made sure that the most famous of the protesters were all carted off together ? to make it easier for the photographers to get good pictures . Friends : Felix Rohatyn 's initiation into the mysteries of the press was a bit loftier , though no less effective . " Most of the reporters assigned to the fiscal story in New York were political reporters , " he recalls . " It created an atmosphere where I could teach them about finance , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 I 'd come back to the office and there 'd be eight messages from eight different Times reporters . Finally I said to one of them , Why do n't you all move in together so I could get you all on one phone call ? ' " Many of the friends Rohatyn made in the press then remain close to him today . He is also friendly with newspaper executives like Michael J. O'Neill , editor of the New York Daily News and Katharine Graham , chairman of The Washington Post Company . What has Rohatyn learned from his wellplaced friends ? " I have a picture of what the press can do and can not do , " he says . " And I guess I 've learned that if you ever wanted to kill a story , the last thing you would do would be to go to Kay Graham or New York Times publisher Arthur Ochs Punch Sulzberger . " Rohatyn is right , of course : newspaper owners in general ? and Graham and Sulzberger in particular ? bristle at any direct attempt to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophistication in these matters , he seriously considered calling Mrs. Graham to complain after NEWSWEEK twice postponed publication of a cover story it had prepared about him last year . In the end , he did n't ? after a friend pointed out that a call to the magazine 's owner would be the worst possible course of action . Eventually , the Rohatyn cover story did run ( NEWSWEEK , May 4 , 1981 ) . When a source wants to get a story spiked , the best approach is to call the reporter who is writing it . Rohatyn is not known for trying to kill stories , but other media handlers are . Former Democratic National Committee Chairman John C. White , for example , once managed to " edit " a New York Times story about a lobbyist for the Libyan Government who had been accused of trying to bribe Carter Administration officials . When White learned that a reporter he knew at the Times was about to publish a story saying , he had given conflicting accounts of meet ings he had had with the lobbyist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persuaded him that it was all " just a misunderstanding . " The tactic worked : the reporter agreed to delete the damaging references to White from the piece . Indispensable Components : Normally , a source 's friendship with a reporter has a far more subtle effect on coverage . For one thing , few self-respecting journalists would ever kill a story they know to be true ? no matter how friendly they are with the subject . As a result , even great media handlers like Rohatyn sometimes get bad publicity . ( Rohatyn refuses to specify his worst experience with the press . " It would give the reporters who did it the pleasure of knowing they got to me , " he says . ) Still , a reporter will naturally try to treat his favorite sources gingerly , especially when the sources are so good that the reporter comes to think of them as indispensable components of his professional life . In general , a public figure 's personality is far more important than his politics in determining his relationship to the press . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jimmy Carter than to Ronald Reagan . But Carter 's manner rubbed reporters the wrong way , and so his relations with the press were nothing short of disastrous . These days , though many reporters have serious reservations about President Reagan 's policies , he continues to enjoy a relatively cordial relationship with most of the regular White House correspondents because they still like him personally . Seduction : The Wall Street Journal 's Hunt provides another perspective on the impact of a media handler 's personality on the press . " I do n't think many of us totally trust Bob Strauss , " Hunt says . " He 's completely self-serving . But he 's an old pro , and he does have good instincts . He 'll tell you the truth when it 's in his interest , and he wo n't when it 's not in his interest . But he so overwhelms you with colorful stuff that sometimes the other stuff gets lost . " The best reporters are always on guard against intellectual seduction by sources who are also their friends . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that men like Strauss may have discovered the best way to penetrate a reporter 's defenses . " The press is probably more easily conned than any other institution ? so long as the con tells them , I 'm conning you ' , " says Carter . " Bob is a master of that . He engages with reporters as though they were what they want to think of themselves as ? real participants in the world they cover . To discover the secret of people like Strauss is to look deep into the heart of journalism ? and not to like everything you see . " @#
