Life is slowly returning to the town of Tenancingo . The grade school has reopened its doors , as have the youth club and the carpentry workshop . Once again women call to one another from window ledges as they sit weaving palm straw into strips for hats and bags . Two weeks ago , bus service resumed to the capital city of San Salvador , 16 miles away , and last week running water started to flow again . Next month , if all goes according to plan , electricity will be restored . If Tenancingo 's progress is modest , its ambition is not . The townspeople aim to make their hamlet a sort of demilitarized zone in the six- year-old Salvadoran civil war . <P> The 70 families that have trickled back into Tenancingo over the past three months fled their homes in 1983 following an air force bombardment aimed at routing leftist guerrillas . Like many of the other 500,000 Salvadorans who have been displaced by the war , the returnees had subsisted in urban slums or overcrowded refugee camps . By returning home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resettle in a war zone without government supervision . Under a plan developed by Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas , Tenancingo has become inerme , a place without weapons , where government troops and leftist rebels are permitted to enter but are not supposed to incite hostilities . While both the military and the guerrillas have pledged to honor Rivera 's plan , there is no binding agreement . " The plan is going ahead with ' an understanding , ' which means it is inevitable that incidents will happen , " says a Western diplomat . <P> Indeed , only weeks after the first residents returned home in late January , the fragile peace was shattered . Army troops tangled with a guerrilla unit on the outskirts of town , leaving three rebels dead . The troops then advanced into Tenancingo firing M-16 rifles and grenade launchers . The soldiers searched homes , detained and interrogated inhabitants , and killed at least one unarmed civilian . A postmortem by directors of the Tenancingo project and human rights officials blamed both sides for the breakdown : the guerrillas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , the army for treating the civilians unjustly and , at times , violently . <P> President Jose Napoleon Duarte labeled the episode " lamentable , " and has called on both sides to respect the agreement . General Adolfo Blandon , the chief of staff , has reaffirmed military support for the project . Tenancingo has long been a rebel-controlled zone and is thus a prime candidate for the army 's newest counterinsurgency campaign , " United to Reconstruct , " which calls for repopulating evacuated war zones with civilians who will be organized into " patriotic self-defense militias . " Some people connected with the Tenancingo project predict it is only a matter of time before their town is made a part of the army 's campaign . <P> After the February fighting , several families left Tenancingo . Within days , however , all had returned and a few new families had even joined the effort . " We are fine , " says Demetrio Archila , 45 . " The planes come by , they look at us , but they let us keep working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only outside it . " That may be a small achievement , but it presents a ray of hope for many Salvadorans . " We do n't need bombs or projectiles , " says one townsman . " We just want to be left alone . We hate this damned war . "
