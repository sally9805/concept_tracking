As they celebrate their 100th anniversary , the Social Democrats now not only admit that the public will not accept higher taxes , but they also plan to cut income taxes sharply . After decades of ignoring complaints that stratospheric taxes were encouraging people to work less , the Social Democrats have proposed reducing the top marginal tax rate from 72 percent to 55 percent. // " We have reached a tax ceiling , " said Kjell-Olof Feldt , Sweden ' s Minister of Finance . " We don ' t believe we can get this economy to function if we increase the tax burden. " // The recognition that they can not raise taxes forever is also causing the Social Democrats to rethink how to manage Sweden ' s huge public sector , and many of them are calling for a more market-oriented approach . As a result of the growing outcry about the uneven state of health care , education and day care , the Government is seeking to inject more competition into providing services to increase quality and efficiency . <> <> Choosing Hospitals Ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital or day care center to go to , and this will be a major step in a nation where the government has often assigned people to specific hospitals or day care centers. // Some leading Social Democrats have even suggested privatizing some basic services , including some hospitals , to increase efficiency . But others fear that privatizing services will simply mean that the rich will obtain better treatment than the poor. // " The squeeze in funds for the public sector has forced people to think in new ways , " said Mr. Feldt , who is the chief architect of the changes. // This country of 8. 5 million is revamping its closely watched experiment in social democracy , even as many Eastern European governments look to it as a model as they move away from Communism . <> <> Efficiencies Sought // Sweden built its welfare state to help eliminate the inequities of unvarnished capitalism , but now the Swedes want their public sector to achieve more of the efficiencies of capitalism. // " The traditional Social Democratic strategy of the postwar period is no longer viable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic adviser to Prime Minister Olof Palme , who was assassinated in 1986 . " That was to recognize a need , create a public service project to fulfill that need , and then raise taxes for it. " // An idealistic people that used to have seemingly unlimited faith in the ability of government to solve the nation ' s social ills is beginning to recognize the limitations of government . By and large they still support the welfare state , but they are eager to improve it , while perhaps shrinking it - and their tax bite - a bit. // " Since everybody pays , and everyone gets something , we do not have a tax revolt like the one in the United States , " said Mr. Ecklund , principal author of the Social Democrats ' blueprint for the 1990 ' s . " Everyone is well at some time , and everyone is sick at some time , so everyone benefits from the services of the state at some time or other .

" Ten and twenty years ago people were also paying high taxes , but they saw results : new schools , new day care centers , " said Rolf Alsing , editor of Aftonbladet , a union-owned mass-circulation newspaper . " Now they pay even more in taxes , but they don ' t see the same results . They are asking , ' Is it worthwhile ? ' " // There are waiting lists of a year or more to obtain coronary bypasses , hip replacements and cataract operations . Many parents can not find places for their children in day care centers. // " A lot of parents complain that their schoolbooks are falling apart , " said Mona Johansson , a vocational training executive . " Ceilings have fallen down in some schools.

Since people who earn $35 , 000 a year fall into the 72 percent marginal bracket , many workers prefer taking compensatory time-and-a-half , rather than extra pay , for working overtime. // This helps explain why the average Swede works just 31 hours a week , the lowest in the industrialized world . It also helps explain the long lines for medical operations. // " You ' ll find that Swedish doctors probably have the lowest average golf score of any doctors in the world , " said Sten Westerberg , an investment banker who was Deputy Finance Minster when a conservative Government was in charge from 1976 to 1982 . That was the only break in the Social Democrats ' hold on power over the last half century. // The Social Democrats won last year ' s elections with 41 percent of the vote , gaining 156 of the 349 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 Communists to give them a working majority , and continuous feuding between the three major parties on the center and right help keep the Social Democrats in power . <> <> Tax Changes Seen Next Year // They expect the changes in the tax law to be approved and to take effect next year , thanks in part to the backing of the People ' s Party , a centrist group with 44 seats in Parliament. // The Social Democrats have become increasingly sensitive to complaints about taxes as they recognize that high tax rates have fueled inflation . Since more than half of any wage increase goes to taxes , Sweden ' s powerful unions feel compelled to demand hefty pay raises . Sweden ' s inflation rate consistently exceeds those of most industrialized nations. // These factors have pushed the Social Democrats to propose their tax overhaul , which will reduce top rates and eliminate federal income tax for 90 percent of Swedes , while keeping the regional income tax of about 30 percent . Almost 40 percent of the average Swiss worker ' s salary now goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope this package will reduce tax fraud and encourage people to work more . This is important in a nation that has a 1. 6 percent jobless rate and is hampered by a labor shortage . <> <> Growth Rate Among Lowest // But conservatives say taxes will not be cut nearly enough . They contend that high taxes and the rapid expansion in the public sector , where productivity growth is low , explain why Sweden ' s economic growth rate has been among the lowest in the industrialized world over the last two decades. // " A few of us have recognized that the public sector is very badly organized , " said Per-Olof Edin , chief economist for Sweden ' s blue-collar labor federation. // Many Government officials admit that the public sector ' s near monopoly in medical care , day care and education has fostered a lack of attention to quality and efficiency. // A handful of private clinics and hospitals have been allowed to open .

" It ' s a pipe dream of the Socialists that public monopolies can be made to work efficiently , " said Mr. Westerberg , the former conservative official . <> <> Opposition From the Left // Some Social Democrats suggest that if other measures fail , privatization might ultimately be needed to increase competition and to put pressure on public institutions to improve . The proposed changes in the public sector , especially the talk of privatization , have encountered opposition from the left of the Social Democratic Party and from public sector workers , who represent 32 percent of the labor force. // " Privatization will divide peple into social groups , and the poorer you are , the worse quality of care you will get , " said Gunilla Wettergren , an official with the Municipal Employees Union. // In the view of many Social Democrats , their party has reached a fourth turning point . First , the party decided at the turn of the century to support evolutionary rather than revolutionary change . Second , in the 1930 ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-owned industry . Then in the 1950 ' s , it decided to build a generous welfare state. // At this fourth crossroad , the party is recognizing that the welfare state can not grow forever and that a greater market orientation may be needed to manage finite government resources. // " Our main efforts in the past have been to build the welfare structure , " said Finance Minister Feldt . " Now we ' re trying to remodel that building from the interior. " //
