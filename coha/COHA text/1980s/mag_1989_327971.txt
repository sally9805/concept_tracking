The story thus far : British-Indian author Salman Rushdie , 41 , is in hiding somewhere in England . He lives under a death threat imposed by the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , who charges that Rushdie 's new novel , The Satanic Verses , is blasphemous and an insult to Islam . For good measure , Iranians have offered a bounty of as much as $5.2 million to Rushdie 's executioner . The world is stunned by the notion that the Iranian leader would issue a death threat against a British subject who has merely written a work of phantasmagoric fiction that , to be sure , occasionally deals with Islam in a fanciful and irreverent way . <P> A few days later , one of Khomeini 's colleagues , President Ali Khamenei , declares that the death sentence might be rescinded if only Rushdie would repent . Rushdie duly issues a formal apology , saying he meant no insult to true believers . Will Khomeini forgive him ? Will the death sentence be lifted ? <P> Absolutely not . The Ayatullah is made of sterner stuff than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 88 , issued a statement rejecting Rushdie 's apology and declaring flatly , " It is incumbent on every Muslim to do everything possible to send him to hell . " Three days later , in a speech to a group of Iranian clerics , Khomeini added that nothing , not even Western economic sanctions , would " force us to retreat and forgo implementation of God 's decree . " <P> In the first days after the Ayatullah 's shocking death threat , governments and the general public alike in the U.S. and Western Europe were slow to react . Who could believe that a book that practically nobody had read  --  and an often obscure if sometimes brilliant one , at that  --  was the catalyst precipitating a bizarre international crisis ? <P> But as Khomeini repeated his threat again and again , Western governments at last began to take action . Led by Britain and strongly supported by West Germany , the twelve members of the European Community voted to withdraw their top-ranking diplomats from Tehran in protest . So did Canada , Sweden and Norway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Western Europe . <P> Some Americans found the Bush Administration surprisingly slow and reserved in its response . But at midweek the President finally stepped up to the White House lectern and criticized Khomeini 's death sentence as " deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior . " Bush warned that Washington would hold Iran accountable for " any actions against U.S interests . " While it was the strongest statement thus far from anyone in the Government , there was little more that the Administration could do . The U.S. had no diplomatic pawns to move , nor had it ever ended the trade embargo imposed on Iran in 1979 . In fact , the Bush Administration seemed to be acting with considerable restraint , perhaps to protect the nine American hostages still in the hands of fanatic Muslims linked to Iran . Much of the week 's most vocal outrage came from writers and publishers , who belatedly rallied to Rushdie 's defense . Not a word was heard from Moscow .               @ @ @ @ @ @
