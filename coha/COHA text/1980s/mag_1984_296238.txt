The B-1A bomber had already started to dive toward the Mojave Desert when a chase plane radioed to Co-Pilot Doug Benefield , " How are you doing , Doug ? " Replied Benefield : " We may have to punch it . We have to punch . " Those were his last known words . Command Pilot Richard Reynolds pulled the eject handle , flinging the cock pit and its three-man crew free of the plane just 9 sec. before it slammed into the ground . Two of the men escaped with injuries . <P> But Benefield , 55 , chief test pilot for Rockwell International Corp. , which builds the bomber , died of severe head wounds . <P> The Air Force has announced the cause of the Aug. 29 crash : human error . As the plane 's movable wings were swung forward for a low-altitude test , Benefield apparently forgot to switch on a mechanism that shifts fuel among various tanks . The B-lA 's center of gravity thus stayed toward the tail , causing the bomber to rear up at a 70 angle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was the result of faulty equipment . One of three explosive bolts designed to reposition the escape capsule for a bottom-first landing on airbags failed to fire , causing the cockpit to hit the ground nose first .
