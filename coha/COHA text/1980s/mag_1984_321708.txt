He was last photographed on Dec. 10 , 1983 , when he moved out of the Prime Minister 's official residence on Jerusalem 's Balfour Street . Even then , he did not emerge in full view : slightly stooped and showing his age , Menachem Begin , 70 , was partly shielded by his daughter Hassia . The curiosity was understandable . Begin had been in seclusion since the previous September , after he abruptly announced he was quitting the job he had held since 1977 . " I can not carry on , " he said simply . Aides and friends alike described him as darkly depressed by the 1982 death of his wife Aliza and the continuing toll of a war that was supposed to have been a swift success . Toward the end of his tenure , when a caller complimented him on the invasion of Lebanon , he could only murmur , " But the casualties , the casualties . " <P> Once one of the world 's most visible leaders , Begin now lives like a hermit in a 3 1/2 room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his son Benyamin . He sees his three children ( the third , Leah , works as a ground hostess for El Al ) , nine grandchildren and a few old friends , but no one else . He spends his days reading and talking on the telephone , which he often answers himself . An Israeli diplomat who recently called his home found him well informed and alert . <P> Since Begin has suffered three heart attacks and a stroke , his health remains precarious . Speculation still flourishes on why he resigned . " He is highly sentimental , " explains a former aide . " He took all the responsibility on himself , so for the time being he will not tell his full story nor accuse anybody . " <P> After the election date was announced last March , some supporters lobbied to place Begin 's name on the official list of candidates as a sign of their esteem . But the former Prime Minister demurred . <P> Though out of sight , Begin has not been entirely out of public mind : he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the death of his former Deputy Prime Minister , Yigael Yadin . <P> Nor has his influence completely waned : when Deputy Prime Minister David Levy considered challenging Yitzhak Shamir for the Herut Party nomination , Begin 's son called Levy , presumably at his father 's request , and urged him to withdraw . Levy did . The master politician may have given up his job , but not his touch .
