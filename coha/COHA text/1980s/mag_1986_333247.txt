; When Detroit police raided an East Side drug den last week , they came away with nine rocks of cocaine and one telephone beeper . In two earlier police raids the haul included 89 captured rocks of cocaine , eleven packs of heroin , a dinner plate used for dope cutting  --  and three beepers . Such inventories highlight a trend that authorities are noticing around the country : the telephone beeper or pager , long used as a stay-in-touch device by doctors , plumbers and electricians , is now the gadget of choice for the dope industry as well . " Beepers , " says Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Curtis Hazell , " are the single most common tool of the drug trade . " <P> Inexpensive ( $10 to $60 monthly to lease ) , easy-to-acquire beeper services allow street-smart drug dealers to keep in touch by public telephone . By staying mobile , dealers can remain one step ahead of the police or rivals who might be hunting for them . These days , with drugs moving by land , sea and air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not uncommon for pagers to wash up onshore , " concedes Ann Director of the Telocator Network of America , the Washington trade association that represents radio common carriers .

Says George Vaughn , chairman of the Detroit school board 's safety and security commission : " If a kid is wearing a beeper , that 's supposed to mean that he knows what time it is , that he knows what 's going on . " <P> Although pagers can provide tone or voice messages , many drug merchants prefer the digital version that displays a caller 's return telephone number . They are also partial to pagers that vibrate silently rather than giving off an audible signal . Dealers sometimes use fronts to sign with a paging service to thwart easy tracing . But not always : " We do get some strange or spooky clients in here , " says one Miami beeper salesman . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's licenses , even though I just saw them drive up in a Mercedes . " <P> Police use beepers too , and they sometimes provide unexpected leads . When an unfamiliar number mysteriously appeared on Miami Police Detective Juan Garcia 's digital pager , he dialed it and received an order for 35 lbs . of marijuana . Garcia promised to deliver the goods , went to the designated meeting place and arrested four eager buyers who showed up with $13,000 to make their purchase .
