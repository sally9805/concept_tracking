 | Elation over what is shaping up as one of the largest harvests in American history is rapidly turning into a mood of bitterness and despair for the nation 's 2.5 million farmers . Here in Nebraska and other prime agricultural areas , farmers complain that two consecutive years of unprofitable operations have pushed them to the brink of economic disaster . List year , a severe drought and a heat wave withered crops across much of the country . This year , nature is killing farmers with kindness , giving them extraordinarily good weather through most of the growing season . Result : Record or near-record crops of corn , wheat , rice , soybeans , cotton and other commodities have depressed farm prices . " The more we raise , the less we get , " says Jim Jackson , a grain and livestock farmer near McCool Junction . At the same time , inflation and high interest rates are putting relentless upward pressure on production costs . Data Resources , Inc. , an economicconsulting firm in Lexington , Mass. , recently reported that this cost-price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink of depression reminiscent of the 1930s . " George W. Stone , president of the National Farmers Union , agrees : " The farm economy is in a recession , bordering on a depression for a lot of farmers . " Farm income , which had been forecast to rise to as much as 27 billion dollars , likely will be only slightly better than last year 's 20 billion dollars . Adjusted for inflation , this would make 1981 the second straight year that farm income has dipped below 16 billion dollars , compared with 29.4 billion in 1979 . Farmers have not had such a run of bad luck since 1934 . Hardest hit are young farmers who borrowed heavily in recent years to purchase land and equipment needed to get started in the business . Bankers warn that many of them will be unable to get enough credit to plant next year 's crops unless commodity prices rise and interest rates dip . The worsening economic outlook for farmers is in sharp contrast to superb growing conditions this year , as a team of U.S.News &; World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record harvests . Before tractors , combines and other machinery are stored for the winter , farmers are expected to gather a record 8.08 billion bushels of corn . Yields of 109 bushels an acre will be second only to 1979 . Wheat farmers will produce a record 2.75 billion bushels , 16 percent higher than last season 's . A rice crop of 179 million hundredweight will be 23 percent higher than last year 's yield . The nation 's soybean crop is expected to hit 2.11 billion bushels , 18 percent higher than in 1980 , while cotton production is likely to reach 15.5 million bales this year , 39 percent better than in 1980 . Other crops are doing well , too . The Agriculture Department is forecasting a 1981 grain-sorghum production of 877 million bushels , up 49 percent from last year 's small crop , with yields expected to hit a record 64.4 bushels an acre . Peanut farmers are expected to gather 3.87 billion pounds , up 68 percent from last year 's count . Nature 's abundance is having a devastating impact on prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are down 58 cents a bushel since January 1 . Corn is selling for 67 cents a  | page deleted  | In neighboring Truro , population 407 , Jim H. Dorman is letting his contract with International Harvester to sell major farm implements lapse . " We have n't sold a combine in two years . We have n't sold a tractor since the spring , and there 's the possibility that we may have to repossess some machinery sold as long as three years ago , " says Dorman . His sales are off more than 50 percent from last year ? " and they were n't good then . " Nationwide , tractor sales are running 9 percent below last year 's depressed levels , according to the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute . Farmers have a well-earned reputation for constantly complaining about the weather , low prices , politicians and other factors that affect their business , but observers report that they have never seen farmers in so much trouble as now . David Hays , an implement dealer in the Texas Panhandle city of Dimmitt , believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tractorcade they staged in Washington in 1979 , although economic conditions are far worse . As he looked over his virtually deserted International Harvester showroom in mid-October , Hays observed : " Farmers have tried everything ? they 've expanded , mechanized and adopted new farming methods to increase productivity ? but nothing seems to work . They ca n't seem to make a decent profit on their work . Now they are telling their kids that there is no future in agriculture . " The Crunch Comes For One Farmer Jim Riordan , a young Iowa grain and pig farmer , worries that history is repeating itself . His grandparents lost their farm during the Depression , and now Riordan fears that he will lose his . Like farmers everywhere , Riordan , 31 , sees his dream of a farm life for himself , his wife Nonnie and their two children threatened by low commodity prices , inflation and high interest rates . Since he left a city job in Des Moines more than three years ago , his debt has risen to $88,000 . In November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 180 of the 220 acres he farms is due . Among the debts piling up for him : $20,000 at 7 percent interest over seven years from the Farmers Home Administration to buy a tractor and other tools . $20,000 from the same agency to help plant his crops last year . $10,000 from a local bank at a floating rate , now 19 percent , to cover operating expenses . $38,000 in debt to the bank carried over from his first two years of farming . " All I 'm able to pay off is the interest , " Riordan says . Of the money owed the Farmers Home Administration , $28,000 is due early next year . The heavy debt with the bank also worries Riordan , who adds : " I 've got to somehow reduce that bank debt so they 'll keep going with me . " On the other side of the ledger are declining commodity prices . Corn is selling for 40 cents less per bushel than it costs to grow , and soybeans about $1 less . As a result , the farmer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for higher prices later this year . But if that does n't happen , the bank may force him to sell at a loss . Laments Riordan : " The lenders do n't want to make a long-term commitment to me even though I 'm willing to make a long-term commitment to farming . "
