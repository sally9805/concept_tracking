If the Illinois legislature had intended to exempt the Du Page Water Commission from local zoning rules , it could easily have done so , Du Page County argues in a legal brief filed in its attempt to regulate some aspects of the commission ' s construction of five large water tanks . The commission , in its brief , argues that it has " immunity from local zoning controls " and says that " the legislature placed full , complete and exclusive control " in its hands . Though the county acknowledges that the 1985 Water Commission Act prevents it from interfering with the commission ' s right to choose and acquire specific sites , it nevertheless argues that " the size , design and type of structures to be placed on these sites . . . demand some form of regulation and review to ensure accountability and feasibility in terms of the proposed structures ' impact on the Du Page County citizenry . " At issue is whether the county can have a say in the design of at least three of the tanks , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly in Glendale Heights and partly in unincorporated Bloomingdale Township . The two Lisle Township tanks are to hold 5 million gallons of Lake Michigan water for the $379 million system the commission is building and plans to start operating in 1992 . They are to be 155 feet high and 85 feet in diameter . The other three are to hold 7. 5 million gallons each and will vary in height from 102 to 150 feet and in diameter from 92 to 112 feet . The two not under county jurisdiction are to be built in Roselle and Naperville , the latter in Herrick Lake Forest Preserve , a few feet from a relatively new office building . James J. Holzwart , commission general manager , said in an interview that the county ' s argument is that the county , not his agency , should decide the tank issue . He also said the county ' s brief incorrectly states that the Naperville site is in an unincorporated area . The county got involved after people living and working near all the sites but the one in Roselle objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having such large structures nearby . County officials are seeking a declaratory judgment in Circuit Court to resolve the issue . The commission has rebuffed suggestions that the tanks be placed partly or completely underground . The commission has said repeatedly that its timetable and desire to build a trouble-free and economical system dictate that the structures be above ground . The county ' s brief bears the names of State ' s Atty . James E. Ryan and two of his aides and outside attorneys James G. Schirott and James G. Sotos , both of Itasca . It says that " under the county ' s zoning ordinance , the proposed water tanks are not permitted uses anywhere in unincorporated Du Page County , " and therefore the commission must apply for a special-use permit to build them , so long as this process " is not applied to frustrate or thwart the commission ' s statutory mandate , " which is to build the system . The county ' s brief also says the structures " will irrevocably alter " the landscape , and that the potential harm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its brief , the commission argues that to require it to submit to normal zoning procedures " is contrary to the law of this state and to common sense . " In this brief , prepared by the commission ' s law firm of Burke , Bosselman &; Weaver , the commission says that a grant of power from the legislature to do something , such as build a water system , " will carry with it , by implication , everything necessary to carry out that power and make it effectual and complete . " The power struggle over whether the county or its municipal officials should construct and operate the water system has a long history . Local officials see the tank case as another attempt by County Board Chairman Jack Knuepfer and other county officials to run the show . The Water Commission has 10 members , half of them municipal officials and half of them appointed by Knuepfer , with the chairman also appointed by Knuepfer . Chairman Joel G. Herter , an Elmhurst resident and Oak Brook business executive , has ties to Illinois House Minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Kouba of Elmhurst , financial adviser to Knuepfer , who also lives in Elmhurst , is a member of the commission , and Elmhurst Mayor Robert J. Quinn was sworn in Thursday to a six-year term as a member.
