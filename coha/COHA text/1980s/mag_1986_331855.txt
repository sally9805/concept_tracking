Let 's put the guy in the aisle-seat wise . There he is , just a businessman flying to Daytona Beach , Fla. , straining to keep his deals in place , and next to him is this . . . this gorgeous girl . Long hair , four-alarm wardrobe , sleepy smile that turns surprisingly cordial when he strikes up a conversation . " Spring break , right ? " <P> " No , " she says , a little more amused than he might have expected . " Not exactly . " He tries again . " Working ? " She gives him a small lead . " Sort of . " <P> To forestall any further squirming , the man on the aisle should know that the young woman next to him is Susanna Hoffs from Los Angeles . Her father and mother met at Yale , where he was a med student and she was studying art . Now her father is a psychoanalyst , her mother a film director , and their daughter , who graduated from Berkeley , is . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four members of a sensational rock outfit called the Bangles . Who have a new Columbia album called Different Light . Who have an ace single , Manic Monday , written pseudonymously by Prince and closing like an Exocet onto the top of the charts . Who will not have to introduce themselves to anyone by the time summer rolls around . <P> One more thing . The Bangles is a women 's band . Hoffs , Bass Player Michael Steele , Lead Guitarist Vicki Peterson and her sister , Drummer Debbi Peterson , all in their mid-20s , have been compared to the Beatles , flatteringly but predictably . Anytime a band comes along that has an act full of fun , a songbook full of tunes with enough hooks to put in a tackle box and a sensual appeal that is insinuating and disarming at once , the Fab Four get trotted out like some handy musical yardstick for measuring progress and promise . No fair . The Bangles are a long way from Ticket to Ride , never mind In My Life . It is still early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accomplishment of their guitar playing is n't fully matched by any assurance of stagecraft , and the vocals ( shared by all four members of the band ) risk being swamped in the amiable uncertainties of the show . The band is aware of such shortfalls of technique . " We pick up a guitar , and we may not be as good as the person next to you , " says Vicki Peterson , " but we have spirit . " <P> Indeed . The Bangles win over the audience as soon as they show up onstage for their 80-minute set . Being a women 's band gives them an edge , and being attractive puts them even further ahead of the game . They do not play coy onstage , and their come-on is never as sexy as their pal Prince 's , but those guys screaming in the crowd out there are n't just going bonkers for the guitar licks .
