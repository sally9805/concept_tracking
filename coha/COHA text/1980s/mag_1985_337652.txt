The menacing action began last Wednesday , on barren , rock-strewn ground marking a rare flat stretch of the rugged border between Marxist Nicaragua and U.S. ally Honduras . The oppressive quiet of early afternoon was broken by a buzz , quickly swelling into a roar . Out of a cloud of dust lumbered heavy tanks and armored personnel carriers , following an obvious invasion route north toward the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa , some 80 miles away . <P> The U.S. had long imagined that a showdown in Central America might begin that way , and Washington was assembling a fleet of 39 warships for counteraction on the other side of the isthmus . On D day next Tuesday , 2,000 Marines will storm ashore from amphibious assault craft onto an isolated strip of sand near Puerto Castilla , on the Caribbean coast of Honduras . They will secure a beachhead for troops of the Army 's 101st Airborne Division , who will be flown in by helicopter the following day . By the end of next week , about 10,000 American troops will have gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one operation , U.S. and Honduran soldiers will push off side by side from base camps , practicing ways to search the jungles of northern Honduras for leftist guerrillas who might rise in response to a call from Managua to support an invasion . <P> And what will the Nicaraguans be doing ? Just watching and , if all goes according to Washington 's script , perhaps shuddering a bit at the display of U.S. force near their border . Those tanks , for instance , were manned by soldiers of the Texas National Guard , playing the role of invading Sandinistas for the benefit of Honduran pilots , who carried out mock bombing and strafing runs against them ( see box ) . Officially , the maneuvers are not even war games , just joint " training exercises . " Pentagon officials go so far as to insist , with resolutely straight faces , that last week 's " tank battle " and next week 's amphibious landing are not directly linked . <P> Though the maneuvers are scarcely unprecedented , they are clearly extraordinary . Honduras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes an ideal base for U.S. operations in Central America . About 1,500 American troops are stationed there , and the U.S. has built a network of permanent facilities : airfields , antitank ditches , a full-size military hospital . It is no secret that some of these facilities have been used to support American allies outside Honduras . Contra guerrillas battling the Sandinistas in Nicaragua train at American-built camps in Honduras ; U.S. pilotless , or drone , planes are said to fly from Honduras over El Salvador , spying out concentrations of leftist guerrillas to be attacked by the U.S.-aided government . <P> The current U.S.-Honduran war games , dubbed Big Pine III , extend a series that began in 1983 and has become nearly continuous . In between the big maneuvers , U.S. and Honduran soldiers nearly always have some small-scale training exercise in progress . Never before , however , have so many U.S. soldiers participated in the games or used such heavy equipment so close to Nicaragua ( some of the tanks maneuvered within three miles of the border ) . Next week 's amphibious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Pine III , represents the most intricate military exercise the U.S. has conducted in this hemisphere .
