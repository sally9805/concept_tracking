Launching a Domestic Counterrevolution <P> It was a virtuoso performance . Exploiting the stunning election victory that made him TIME 'S Man of the Year for 1980 , Ronald Reagan launched a conservative counterrevolution , changing the direction of American government more drastically than any other President in half a century . Not even the bullet from a would-be assassin 's gun that pierced his left lung on March 30 could slow his initial momentum . <P> Reagan conceived , lobbied for and won huge budget cuts , slowing the growth rate of federal spending and shrinking some social programs that had been expanding irresistibly since the early days of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal . He also won a startling 23% , three-year cut in income tax rates . Reagan exerted the greatest mastery over Congress that any President has displayed since Lyndon Johnson . The Great Communicator skillfully convinced the public on TV , and legislators in one-on-one chats , that only by reducing the size of government and stimulating productivity in the private economy could inflation be curbed and healthy economic growth resume . Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor and unduly rewarding the rich , but they could not come anywhere near mustering the public support that the President commanded . <P> It remains to be seen whether Reagan has devised the right combination for the economy . Inflation is abating somewhat , but the nation has stumbled into a recession that Reagan admitted he had not foreseen . The combined impact of the recession and the tax cuts threatens disastrous budget deficits that Reagan has not yet found any persuasive way to shrink . <P> Though Reagan dominated domestic affairs , the same can not be said of his handling of foreign policy issues . His strident anti-Soviet rhetoric increased cold war jitters . Using all his political wile the clout , the President won grudging Senate assent for the sale of AWACS radar planes to Saudi Arabia . The victory staved off what would have been a humiliating public defeat but did little to advance any coherent U.S. strategy for bringing peace to the Middle East . <P> The Administration 's most imaginative proposal , embracing the " zero option " . in talks with the U.S.S.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive the Polish crisis . At home , the troubles of Budget Boss David Stockman , National Security Adviser Richard Allen and Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan pointed up the thinness of talent in the Administration : the supporting cast is not of the same caliber as the star . <P> Looking ahead to 1982 , Reagan still has the initiative in dealing with the disorganized congressional Democrats . But , to use a show-biz term that the President would appreciate , his own whirlwind first year has given him a tough act to follow . He may not be able to top it . <P> Inspiring a Ravenous Curiosity <P> She uttered no sweeping pronouncements or stern warnings ; she neither applauded nor deplored . She kept her views on the age 's pressing problems to herself . She simply said , " Yes , quite promptly , " one day last February , and much of the world immediately fell in love .
