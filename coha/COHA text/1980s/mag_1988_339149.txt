As soon as the poster appeared in the perestroika display window on Gorky Street in downtown Moscow , passersby paused to stare and snicker . The hulking , black silhouette shown atop an awards stand was unmistakably that of Leonid Brezhnev , bushy eyebrows and all . But in place of his numerous military ribbons , the deceased Soviet leader wore a row of stripes labeled CORRUPTION , EMBEZZLEMENT , GRAFT and MONEYGRUBBING . The lower tiers of the stand , two caricatured gangsters  --  one American , the other Italian  --  stared up at Brezhnev with apparent surprise . The caption beneath the cartoon said it all : SO , MAFIOSO , YOU FINALLY " DIG " WHO IS THE REAL GODFATHER . <P> There was a time when Mafia and Godfather were alien words in the official Soviet vocabulary , and organized crime was considered an inevitable by-product of decadent capitalism . No longer . Inspired by Party Leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater honesty and openness , criminal investigators have begun unraveling a web of crime and corruption , dating back to the Brezhnev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uzbekistan to the highest levels of government in Moscow . <P> This week the most famous defendant netted in the five-year Uzbek investigation will go on trial before the military tribunal of the U.S.S.R. 's Supreme Court in Moscow . Yuri Churbanov , 51 , Brezhnev 's son-in-law and a former First Deputy Minister of the Interior , stands accused of accepting more than $1 million in bribes from Uzbek officials during the late 1970s and early 1980s . Eight other officials will be in the dock , including the former Uzbek Interior Minister and several regional police chiefs . If found guilty , the defendants could be sentenced to death . Churbanov 's wife Galina , who is Brezhnev 's daughter and has been linked to a Moscow diamond-smuggling ring , may be called to the witness stand . <P> Despite public demands that the trial be turned into an expose of the Brezhnev era , Defense Lawyer Andrei Makarov last week denounced any attempt " to try to judge Brezhnev under Churbanov 's name . " <P> Nonetheless , high-level indignation over the Churbanov affair and the moral decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a scathing article titled " The Son-in-Law and His Clan , " Churbanov was depicted as a vain and ambitious man of limited abilities who exploited his connection with Brezhnev to climb up the hierarchy of the Soviet police . The newspaper made clear that he was only a tool in the hands of others , who were operating a mammoth racket in Uzbekistan to falsify cotton-production reports and swindle the state . <P> Organized crime first began to flourish on a large scale during the Brezhnev years in what has come to be known as the " shadow economy . " Underground businessmen , who amassed wealth by siphoning off funds from the state budget for lucrative private ventures , proved an easy target for blackmail by small- time thugs . After gangsters began to demand " protection " money , a deal was reportedly cut at a conference in the northern Caucasus in the mid-1970s , with the illegal millionaires agreeing to pay 10% of their income to the crime lords .                @ @ @ @ @
