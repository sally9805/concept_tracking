When composer Frederick Loewe looked back on a career with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner that included Brigadoon , My Fair Lady and Camelot , he reportedly said he could not get over how easy he and his partner made it all seem . Loewe was right , but in retrospect the most startling thing about the team 's success is that their creativity was far from unique . In the heyday of Broadway musicals , nearly every season brought a landmark production , often two or three . The 1946-47 season that introduced Brigadoon , for example , also provided Finian 's Rainbow . The 1956-57 season of My Fair Lady was , in addition , the season of Bells Are Ringing , Candide , The Most Happy Fella and Li'l Abner . The 1960-61 debut season of Camelot saw as well the arrival of Irma la Douce , The Unsinkable Molly Brown and Bye Bye Birdie . <P> Any one of those shows would seem a godsend to the Wan White Way of the ' 80s . With three striking exceptions  --  Dreamgirls , Big River and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decade has been a revival , a recycling of old songs , an import ( generally from Britain ) or a critical smash but commercial also-ran . The current season , which by Broadway 's calendar began in May , is more miserable than most . Its first American musical , Carrie , actually a slightly postponed holdover from last season , closed within five performances at a record loss of $7 million . The sole entry since , Legs Diamond , a quirky blend of gangster spoof and show-biz biography , opened last week to killer reviews , although the producers launched a $350,000 TV ad campaign and vowed to hang on . <P> The season 's musical hopes now rest almost entirely on material from the past : a Jerome Robbins retrospective ; a blues-and-dance collage with no new songs , Black and Blue , from the creators of Tango Argentino ; and a Duke Ellington score , Queenie Pie , left unfinished at his death in 1974 , that has been touted for Broadway for three seasons . Says Rocco Landesman , a producer who succeeded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical there are 40 ways for things to go wrong and only one for them to go right , which is for everything to come together . " <P> That did not happen for Legs Diamond . Despite five years of development , the show that previewed in late October was , in the blunt judgment of co-producer Arthur Rubin , " a disaster . " Librettist Harvey Fierstein apologized to the audience at the first performance . Alluding to the practice of testing a show out of town , which Legs skipped because of its complex sets and lighting , Fierstein said , " Ladies and gentlemen , this is New Haven . " <P> Previews continued for nine weeks  --  unusually long , but not a Broadway record  --  as musical numbers , costly scenery , characters and whole subplots came and went . On some nights more than a hundred paying customers left at intermission or even during the performance . One couple who marched up the aisle during the second act seemed particularly weary of a plot device that has the hero , a tap-dancing gang leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman looked back at the stage , she whispered , " He 's alive again . " Muttered her companion : " Better he should have stayed dead . "
