CRIMES OF THE HEART by Beth Henley <P> This is a tale of three sisters . One is a spinster , one is a sexpot , and one is a screwball . The tangled web of relationships they weave possesses sprightly humor , zany logic , folksy warmth and a tincture of poignancy . The author 's first full-length play and a Pulitzer prizewinner , Crimes of the Heart is a kind of in-depth soap opera that reveals character even as it unravels situations . <P> The locale is Hazelhurst , Miss. , and the time is " five years after Hurricane Camille , " Playwright Henley 's little hint that this clan is disaster-prone . Lenny MaGrath ( Lizbeth Mackay ) , the eldest sister , is facing her 30th birthday with " a shrunken ovary " and no gentlemen callers in sight . She is plain of face , finicky in manner and gnawed by self-doubt . She had a heartfelt romance once but skittered away from it in fear and put her emotions in a deep freeze . The kind of event that nails her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predilection for bizarre Southern Gothic extravagance is the death of her horse Billy Boy . Her pet since childhood , Billy Boy has recently been struck by lightning . To top that calamity , Old Granddaddy has been hospitalized with " blood vessels popping in his brain . " <P> The sexpot sister Meg ( Mary Beth Hurt ) knows all about men ( " I 've had too many " ) but astonishingly little about herself . She rushed off to Hollywood because Old Granddaddy fostered the delusion that she could be a singing star . She became a pill-popping swinger and had a mental breakdown . The scar tissue shows in hard-boiled mannerisms and a terror of displaying " weakness . " <P> At 24 , the youngest sister Babe Botrelle ( Mia Dillon ) has reached full immaturity . She is out on bail after having shot her husband in the stomach and very nearly killing him . Asked why she did it , Babe replies , " I did n't like his looks . " Prior to the attempted murder , Babe had been carrying on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Babe answers , " I was so lonely and he was gooood . " <P> What insane lawyer would take such a devil of a case ? The sisters find him in an Ole Miss grad ( Peter MacNicol ) who was smitten with Babe when she once served him pound cake at a church bazaar . Besides , he relishes " personal vendettas . " <P> MacNicol is a comic minefield . His meticulous legalisms are at total variance with his discombobulated manner . He wears his clothes as if they were still on the rack . <P> He walks like an unstrung robot , and his voice seems to come from a retarded answering service . <P> Out of such recalcitrant , semitragic , and seemingly implausible materials , Henley wrests combustible spasms of laughter . Perhaps she makes playgoers see their own catastrophes as others see them . <P> She is lucky to hold ace cards in her casting hand . Mackay , Hurt and Dillon seem to have been born under the same roof , sharing a past , a present and a future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
