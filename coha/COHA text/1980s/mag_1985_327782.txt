When CBS last November paid $362.5 million to buy twelve Ziff-Davis magazines ( combined monthly circulation : more than 4.5 million ) , quite a few people thought that the broadcaster had paid too handsome a sum . But CBS Chairman Thomas Wyman remained unfazed , proclaiming the agreement " a rare opportunity to acquire a very successful , well-managed business . " <P> Now that conviction has crumbled . In a suit filed last week in New York State Supreme Court , CBS contends that Ziff Corp. , the parent company of Ziff- Davis , along with its auditors at Touche Ross , fraudulently misrepresented the company 's finances when the deal for the dozen periodicals , including Modern Bride and Stereo Review , was struck . CBS alleges that Ziff Corp . understated costs , perhaps by $4 million , and overstated revenues and operating income , possibly by as much as $40 million . The broadcaster , whose Manhattan office tower is known as Black Rock , seeks an undetermined amount of damages . <P> Ziff Corp . calls CBS 's charges " absurd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's executive committee : " I am appalled . I am angry . " The courts will decide whose ire is justified .
