 | As campaign come-ons go , " industrial policy " will probably never rank rhetorically with " a chicken in every pot " or even " Nixon 's the One . " But however homely it may sound , " i.p. , " as cognoscenti call it , already bids fair to become one of the Democratic buzzwords for 1984 . Sen. John Glenn took not one but two position papers on i.p. to study on his recent vacation . Sen. Gary Hart wrote a book discussing it . Sen. Edward Kennedy and former Vice President Walter Mondale have both endorsed the concept , and Sen. Alan Cranston mentions it across the land . Moreover , i.p. ' s stock should rise soon when a group of labor and business leaders ? headed by former Du Pont chairman Irving Shapiro , investment banker Felix Rohatyn and AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland ? weigh in with their proposals on how the federal government can coordinate a rescue of old industries and encourage new ones . " We need to offer a real alternative to Ronald Reagan , " says policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think industrial policy is part of that . " The notion that governments can and should choreograph their economies is not exactly new : Alexander Hamilton was lobbying for an i.p. of sorts way back in 1791 . Countries from France to Japan to the Soviet Union all practice some form of national economic strategy , and even though socialist planning raises hackles in the United States today , Washington has been known to step in sporadically ( sometimes profitably ? as with the Chrysler Corp . bailout of 1979 ) . The current recovery notwithstanding , many Americans are still worried about the future of such basic industries as steel and rubber , the delicate state of productivity and research and the fierce competition from the much-managed Japanese . And a growing number of Democrats now hope to capitalize on those concerns by offering i.p. as the antidote ? or at least a computer catch-phrase ? to Reaganomics , if only they can do so without raising the dread specter of Kremlinesque controls . As outlined in the draft proposal now circulating among members of the Task Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements . On an Economic Coordinating Council appointed by the president , representatives from government , business and labor would set the rules under which declining , " sunset " industries and their workers could formulate packages of wage givebacks and other concessions qualifying them for federal aid . To provide it , an Industrial Development Bank would be established , with $2.5 billion in congressiona : appropriations and 10 times that in borrowing authority . And to encourage innovation and foster " sunrise " industries , a Nationa Technology Foundation ? patterned after the National Science Foundation ? would channel as much as $10 billion a year into applied research and specific development projects . Disagreement among commission members over the details has helped delay the report 's release from early September to a tentative November deadline . Some commission members ? especially from business ? balk at the sums and the bureaucratic image involved . Mindful of the Orwellian overtones in what is , after all , 1984. none of the Democratic contenders is thinking quite as big . Glenn is not yet convinced that any new planning process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. " says policy adviser Michael Wack Cranston , the most ardent supporter so far , is firmly behind the creation of an industrial-development bank that would function like the Depression-era Reconstruction Finance Corp . Hart would keen the power to put industry-wide " compacts " in the hands of the office of the president rather than create a powerful new body Mondale ? proudly claiming the Chrysler Corp . deal as his own ? supports the creation of an advisory council but has so far stopped short of endorsing a bank . Even when its report is finally ready , the commission wo n't have the last word on i.p . Ted Kennedy chairs a task force on the subject for the Senate Democratic Policy Committee , and its proposals ? probably the most ambitious yet ? are timed to appear just before the dawning of the first presidential primaries . If the recovery under Reagan spreads and strengthens , of course , it might render the whole idea of industrial policymaking as quaintly irrelevant for most voters as Gerald Ford 's campaign to " Whip Inflation Now " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
