In 1981 Entrepreneur Eugene Lang promised 61 Harlem sixth-graders he would pay their college costs if they stayed in school . As it turns out , he laid the seeds not only for their future education but also for a host of generous imitators around the country . The latest and perhaps largest benefactor is Avron Fogelman , a Memphis real estate developer and co-owner of the Kansas City Royals . Last week Fogelman , 47 , announced he would subsidize tuition perpetually for disadvantaged Memphis-area public school students who go to Memphis State University . Fogelman has put up an initial $2.5 million , and will add some $2 million annually over ten years . The first beneficiaries will be current seventh-graders . To receive the assistance , needy students must , among other things , maintain passing grades and take part in some kind of public service activity . " We want to break the poverty cycle , " says the donor . Philanthropically inclined tycoons , take note .                 @ @ @ @
