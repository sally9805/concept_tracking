Sometimes very good wine gets kept until last . After a year in which the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's public has submitted , once more , to being treated like two tons of anchovies in a cannery in return for a look at Degas , we have an exhibition of 15th century Sienese painting in the Met 's Robert Lehman Wing , opening just in time for Christmas . " Painting in Renaissance Siena " is not only a delectable exhibition ; there is also a chance that one might be able to see it , given the relative lack of interest in the 15th century . It is , in a way , a show for escapists  --  for what could be more pleasant than to flee the brutish realities of modern life for the enameled , fictive grace and small harmonious scale of these predella fragments and miniatures by Sassetta , Giovanni di Paolo and Girolamo da Cremona ? <P> But it is also , in excelsis , a show about connoisseurship , not block- busting . It was scrupulously and intelligently put together by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European paintings . His aim , as far as possible , was to concentrate on narrative painting  --  stories from the Bible , mainly  --  instead of the static images of the Madonna in which Sienese painting abounds . Because these narratives are usually found in the small scenes around compound altarpieces , they have been scattered from Budapest to Melbourne in what museums euphemistically call the " dispersal "  --  the dismemberment by thieves and dealers  --  of big church paintings . <P> At the Met , a number of these narratives have been reassembled for the first time this century , and they are a delight to see . The show is meant as a 75th birthday tribute to the redoubtable Sir John Pope-Hennessy , formerly chairman of the department of European painting at the Met and one of the great scholars of the Italian Renaissance . No doubt the Pope , as Hennessy is known , will be happy : when he was 23 , he wrote his own book on the Sienese painter Giovanni di Paolo . <P> Not since 1904 has there been a proper survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasms of Bernard Berenson and his heir Pope-Hennessy could give a Sienese artist like Sassetta the popularity of a Florentine like Botticelli . Even today , Sano di Pietro and the Master of the Osservanza are not exactly names to conjure with . Florence , Siena 's political and cultural rival , emerged from their wars victorious in more ways than one . Firenze has always dominated the Western imagination . You can not imagine the city of Giotto , Masaccio , Donatello , Brunelleschi , Leonardo and Michelangelo any differently : Florence was the locus classicus of Renaissance thought and art .
