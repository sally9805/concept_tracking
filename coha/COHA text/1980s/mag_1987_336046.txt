Jose Napoleon Duarte has enjoyed his share of lucky breaks over the years , but even he must appreciate the propitious timing of the latest Central American peace proposal . Often cited as the showcase of U.S. efforts to bolster democracy in Central America , El Salvador is in deepening trouble . The civil war that has claimed 70,000 lives in eight years shows no sign of winding down . A much heralded campaign to revive the economy has foundered . Even the President 's most striking accomplishment , the sharp reduction in killings by right-wing Salvadoran death squads , has been compromised by a recent spate of murders of peasants who were linked to the guerrillas . As a result , Salvadorans are displaying growing impatience with the U.S.-supported Duarte , 61 . <P> Duarte 's best hope now is that the Guatemala peace initiative will force the Salvadoran rebels to lay down their arms . Under the accord , outside aid to all guerrilla groups must cease , which means that clandestine arms shipments to the guerrillas from Cuba and Nicaragua would stop . Says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Salvadoran government . " <P> Perhaps . The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front showed little interest in the peace plan when it was first discussed in February , but the rebels were forced to pay closer attention when Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega joined Duarte in affixing his signature to the accord two weeks ago . Last week Duarte proposed that the rebels sit down with his government on Sept. 15 to discuss a cease-fire and amnesty . The rebels agreed to talk but not under the aegis of the Guatemala Plan . <P> If the accord is ultimately implemented without rebel participation , U.S. officials warn that the F.M.L.N . will be able to threaten Duarte 's government even if outside military aid is cut off . Operating in small bands and able to retreat to rural hideaways , the rebels could continue to inflict damage in the countryside . Indeed , on the very day that Duarte signed the accord , guerrillas attacked a Salvadoran town called El Triunfo and burned down three public buildings , including the mayor 's office . Only days earlier , the insurgents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major span hit in the past seven weeks . <P> Shortly after his election in 1984 , Duarte strode into the small town of La Palma for a dramatic , highly publicized meeting with guerrilla representatives . Subsequent attempts at talks fizzled , however . For a while , it did not seem to matter . Strengthened by dozens of U.S.-supplied helicopter gunships , the 52,000-strong Salvadoran army seemed to be slowly gaining the initiative . F.M.L.N . forces dwindled from an estimated 11,000 to around 7,000 , and they alienated supporters by torching buses and planting land mines , maiming innocent civilians .
