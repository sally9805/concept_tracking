Camil DesRoches was saying , " but I honestly // think this was the greatest hockey team of all time. " // He pointed to a color photograph on his office wall , a picture of the Montreal Canadiens who won their fifth straight Stanley Cup 24 springs ago . His total impartiality was tempered not in the slightest by his being employed by the Canadiens for the past 46 years. // Camil DesRoches spent yesterday morning escorting a greenhorn on his first visit to the Forum , a pilgrimmage somewhat akin to the first visit to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem , or St. Peter ' s in Rome or Westminster Abbey in London : the feeling of closeness to the soul of a people. // " I always say that hockey is like a religion here in Quebec , " Camil DesRoches was saying . " We are perhaps 90 percent Catholic , but we are all hockey fans. " // Camil DesRoches is a classic Gallic gentleman , nearly 70 years old , with a thin mustache and a large heart . He loves his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma " 26 times ) , he loves wine ( " We have never had a bottle of milk in my house , and I still have all my teeth " ) . But just as strongly , he loves the Canadiens , and he loves the Forum , for which he is now the publicity director. // He was conducting the tour on a day of both sadness and anticipation . Yesterday morning , there was a funeral for Claude Provost , a member of the five-time Stanley Cup champions , who died on a tennis court in Florida last week . Later in the evening , the current Canadiens would work on stopping the Islanders from winning a fifth straight Stanley Cup. // The Islanders were taking a brief workout as Camil DesRoches led the visitor into the stands . Outside , on a perfect spring morning , the Forum seemed an ordinary brick building , surrounded by traditional Montreal tenements with their dark fire escapes . But inside , the Forum seemed a holy place , where one lowered his voice. // On the morning a Canadien was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this building in 1937 the body of the great Howie Morenz was put on public display after his death from complications following a broken leg ( suffered , as the history books always say , when he crashed into the boards on the St. Catherine Street side of the Forum ) . The Forum was filled with 15 , 000 people , yet it was as silent as a cathedral. // Yesterday the Forum ' s lower red seats glistened , as if painted five minutes earlier , and so did the middle white and upper blue sections , forming a classic tricolor . The stands of the Forum are oval-shaped , following the shape of the rink itself , just as the best bull rings and soccer stadiums of Europe are tailored for one sport , rather than multi-purpose arenas not quite right for any sport. // " There used to be eight columns , " Camil DesRoches was saying . " So in 1968 , we rebuilt the Forum completely in five and a half months months , leaving only the seats . Look how narrow they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that way , 16 , 400 seats in all. " // // From the rafters hang 22 banners , signifying // the club ' s Stanley Cups , 20 of them won since // the Forum opened in 1924. // " The best game I ever saw here ? " he said . " Maybe in 1936 , when the Maroons beat Detroit in six overtimes when Mud Bruneteau scored . I got home at 2 : 25 AM . Or maybe it was Dec. 14 , 1965 , when our so-called amateur club beat the Russians using Jacques Plante , who had just left the Rangers a few months earlier. // " Or maybe it was March 23 , 1944 , when Maurice Richard scored all five goals to beat Toronto , 5-1 , and they named him all the top three stars of the game . Or what about the game in 1979 , when Boston got a penalty in the last minute and Lafleur and Lambert scored to win it ? " // The pucks from the Islanders ' target practice started slamming into the shining red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out Le Salon des Anciens - the Old Timers ' Room - where former Canadiens are welcome. // The Canadiens are noted for their propriety , including a private room for the wives of the players . Only recently have patrons been allowed to carry beer to their seats , an experiment that would end at the first abuse. // In the lobby , two escalators form the pattern of crossed hockey sticks , a sight Ken Dryden , the retired goalie , always found compelling . Nearby , is the Pantheon of Montreal hockey , the plaques of 30 players and coaches from Quebec who had their best years wearing the **28;926; bleu , blanc , rouge. <> // Near the entrance is Le Club de Bronze , 11 bronze busts of journalists and broadcasters considered to be friends of Montreal hockey . The 12th bust is of Camil DesRoches. // " I feel funny every time I see that , " he said with a shrug. // The next stop was the Canadiens ' dressing room . On one wall are plaques containing the names of every player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. John McCrea ' s poem , " In Flanders Fields. " // In English it says : **28;956; " To You , From Fallen Hands We Throw the <> // Torch , Be Yours to Hold It High. " // On the other side of the room , Camil DesRoches has translated it into French : // " **28;986; Nos Bras Meurtris Vous Tendent Le Flambeau , A Vous Toujours de le Porter Bien Haut. " <> // Camil DesRoches said : " I have been told I did a good job of translating but also making it rhyme in French. " // // Over a glass of **28;1016; vin rouge , <> Camil DesRoches talked of being the youngest of 19 children , of being taken to the cellar when he was 6 years old and being shown the barrel of beer and the bottles of wine. // " My father said : ' You are almost grown up now . You can drink what you want - but never get drunk . ' I got drunk once , when I was 17 , and my father made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that condition . I never got drunk again in my life . " Sipping his wine , he compared three of the great Canadiens of his 46 years : " Maurice Richard was the Michelangelo of hockey - such dedication , he would work on his back painting the Sistine Chapel , never give up . Jean Beliveau , complete finesse , what style , he was the Da Vinci of hockey . And Guy Lafleur is like Raphael , whose career was not long , but he was an artist and he had a great time. " // When lunch was over , Camil DesRoches concluded : " I hope you enjoyed the visit to the Forum . Also , I hope you see what it means to our French environment here in Quebec , just like the language , part of our life. " //
