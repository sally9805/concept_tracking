Any day now , the ads may start appearing on the covers of matchbooks : " Booming opportunities in the fastest growing field in America ! Meet powerful people and appear on TV ! If you 've got a brain , we can train ! Enroll now and enter the exciting world of Presidential Debate Moderators ! Iowa and New Hampshire residents qualify for our special volume discount . " <P> Farfetched ? Not when you consider that 1987 has become the year of the Great Debate Spate . The seven Democratic contenders have already traded mild jabs on PBS and C-Span . Two more Democratic events are scheduled for September . On the Republican side , Moderator William Buckley will toss out the first bon mot on Oct. 28 , when all six G.O.P. contenders , including an initially reluctant Vice President George Bush , appear on Firing Line . <P> By then , a full year before Election Day 1988 , most candidates will be debating more often than members of the Oxford Union . Campaigns are besieged by would-be hosts ; both Senator Paul Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 invitations to debate their Democratic rivals . <P> Talk is cheap , which may be the simplest explanation for this unexpected glut of gab . Cable television and inexpensive satellite hookups provide the perfect forum for sparring candidates to receive free media exposure .

In truth , Gore 's criticisms were tepid in the extreme : " With all due respect to my friend from Massachusetts , we need some specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from opposition to aid to the contras to horror at the Reagan deficits , any expression of individuality is treated as major news . The Republicans will soon be debating within their own philosophical straitjacket : the need to prove they are at least as conservative as the Reagan Administration . <P> Faced with the tedium of me-too panel discussions , candidates have created their own exhibition season . No longer does a contender have to wait to be nominated to experience the joys of hurling invective face-to-face at an opponent from the other party . Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Republican Pete du Pont invented the do-it-yourself presidential debate back in May as a way of calling attention to their long-shot candidacies . It may have been a gimmick , but their interparty face-off produced a vibrancy rarely matched in a campaign season devoid of transcendent issues .
