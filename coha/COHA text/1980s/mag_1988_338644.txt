With surprising harmony , the Democrats all but completed drafting their platform last week . The relatively brief , 3,500-word document ( the elephantine 1984 version was 40,000 words ) signals a sharp break with the party 's promise- them-anything past . This time there are no bold pledges to match earlier advocacy of guaranteed jobs ( 1972 ) and national health insurance ( 1980 ) . Gone too is the usual laundry list of narrow causes like the 1984 vow to " eliminate ethnic stereotyping . " The 1988 platform may be purposely vague , but there are hidden subtexts beneath the soporific rhetoric . <P> " The Restoration of Competence and Hope " <P> The awkward title says it all : the platform tries to meld the " competence " of Michael Dukakis with the " hope " conveyed by Jesse Jackson . " Restoration " can be seen as a small bow to the platform 's author , Theodore Sorensen , who was John Kennedy 's speechwriter . Sorensen 's secret : exhausting run-on sentences that cleverly mask meaning with their painful paucity of verbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , within a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility . . . to . . . reinvest in its people , to invest in new priorities . . . in lifelong education and training . . . in targeted economic development . . . ( ( in ) ) rebuilt American infrastructure and public facilities . " <P> Read invest as the new Democratic code word for spend ; rarely have so many potentially budget-busting programs been separated by so little punctuation . Dukakis is the apostle of " targeted economic development , " while Jackson has . stressed creating public service jobs to rebuild America 's " infrastructure . " The platform neglects to explain how " fiscal responsibility " might be achieved . But Jackson is likely to wage a convention floor fight on this point to insert a pledge to raise the taxes of the wealthy . Dukakis ' likely response : " Go ahead , make my day . " <P> " We believe that America needs more trade , fair trade , an administration willing . . . to better manage our trade in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Trade was the hottest issue in the early primaries , and here in one sentence are three seemingly contradictory Democratic proposals . Follow the bouncing ball from " more trade " ( Dukakis ) to " fair trade " ( Richard Gephardt ) to halting the export of " American jobs " ( Jackson ) . <P> " We believe that equal access to government services , employment , housing , business enterprise and education should be assured in this multicultural society to every citizen regardless of race , sex , national origin , religion , age , handicapping condition or sexual orientation . " <P> Some things never change , such as the Democrats ' compulsion to list in encylopedic detail all the forms of bias they abhor . A safe bet : the social- science buzz word multicultural will not appear in the G.O.P. platform . <P> " We believe that all Americans should enjoy access to affordable , comprehensive health care . . . from well-baby care . . . to Medicare . . . ( ( and ) ) quality affordable long-term home and health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority . "
