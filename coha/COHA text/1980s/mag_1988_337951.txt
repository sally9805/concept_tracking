" To allow a preacher of the Gospel , when he is caught beyond the shadow of a doubt committing an immoral act . . . to remain in his position as pastor ( or whatever ) , would be the most gross stupidity . " Under the rules of the Assemblies of God , such a sinner must be suspended from preaching for one year and put on probation for a second year , or else there is a danger that the " whole church will be destroyed . " <P> When the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart wrote those sentiments in articles over the past 15 months in his magazine the Evangelist , he obviously believed them . But when the Assemblies last week prescribed precisely that punishment for him , Swaggart defied the decision and declared his intention to renew preaching next month . He thus not only raised questions about his own future but once again trained an unwanted spotlight on the church group that , before the scandals involving Swaggart and Jim Bakker , had become the fastest-growing denomination in the U.S. <P> % After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praying at an emergency session in Springfield , Mo. , 206 general presbyters of the Assemblies toughened a three-month suspension originally imposed by the local district council in Louisiana . They ruled that Swaggart must stay out of the pulpit and off TV for a year ; even past tapes can not be aired . Swaggart nonetheless announced that he would return to television on May 22 , despite the risk of defrocking . <P> Though he has not said publicly what sins he committed , sordid details will be forthcoming just a few weeks after he goes back on the air . Penthouse magazine has solicited , for an undisclosed sum , Prostitute Debra Murphree to give her account of the pornographic acts Swaggart paid her to perform for him over a year 's time . The preacher 's ministry is already losing $1.8 million a month and could be hurt further by those revelations . <P> To many of Swaggart 's followers , though , the larger concern is what harm the past year of Gospelgate will do to his remarkable denomination . " We are ready to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary leader , G. Raymond Carlson . Understandably so . The double-barreled embarrassment involving Bakker and Swaggart , the Assemblies ' two most visible evangelists , has unforgettably tarnished preparations for the denomination 's 75th anniversary next year . But so far the damage has been controllable , testimony to the extraordinary vigor of the Assemblies of God . <P> With 2,135,000 adherents and 11,000 churches in the U.S. , the denomination is one of the Pentecostal groups that took root in the early 1900s . A gathering of pastors formed the Assemblies in 1914 and almost immediately faced down a schism by sticking firmly to orthodox doctrine . Then and now the group 's born-again converts undergo " baptism in the Holy Spirit , " an experience that must be accompanied by speaking in tongues , or glossolalia.
