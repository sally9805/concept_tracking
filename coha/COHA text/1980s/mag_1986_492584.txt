LAST GASPS FROM A CRUSTY OLD ADMIRAL 7 had a navy to run . I thought I I did n't have time to work on my addiction . In fact , I never really realized what an addiction I had developed until it was too late and I was too busy . We used to laugh when my dad would smile and say , " Yes , I 'd walk ten miles for a Camel , " and we knew he meant it . We grew up during the Great Depression , and we 'd sit around the kitchen table watching him roll his cigarettes with tobacco from a large , round can of red Velveeta . He had a smaller , rectangular can to take to the field with him for pipe tobacco . But at the kitchen table he would seem to be especially relaxed and happy while preparing his next treat . He would lick tiny cigarette papers to moisten them so they would seal and not lose their lumpy contents . His large , burly fingers would look clumsy handling the flimsy cigarette papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while mimicking dancers of the ' 30s , holding up the cigarette with its pinched ends as if it were a prized work of art . Later he would mimic President Roosevelt ( whom he resembled a great deal ) with his cigarette holder . When he went out on very special occasions , he would have a pack of Camels , and thus came his happy boast , " I 'd walk a mile for a Camel . " Dad would vouch for that slogan . During the Hoover and early Roosevelt years , rural electrification had not yet hit Iowa farm country . We depended on our squeaking windmill to pump water and on our own muscle power to distribute it to the ever-thirsty livestock and chickens . There was n't time to smoke while " choring . " Can you imagine smok ing while milking a cow ? Dad milked by hand . Let me tell you about that . You may not know that when you milk cows , you milk from the right side . Cows do n't like to get milked from the left side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow always manages to sleep on the right side , so when you get up and go to milk , you stick your head in the side of a frosty cow . The cow normally manages to get its tail in the muck , and there are these clinkers of frozen mud in its tail , so you sit there with your head in the side of a frosty cow with these frozen clinkers flapping on the side of your face . One ca n't roll cigarettes while guiding a plow , either . The reason my dad and his neighbors were n't dying from lung cancer , heart disease , or emphysema was that even roll-your-own cigarette tobacco was in short supply . I remember when my older sister Dorothy saved up the money she got for cleaning our chicken house to buy dad a brightly decorated gift canister of Velveeta for Christmas and wrapped it proudly . This took many Saturday afternoons of staying home while our parents went to town for their weekly trading , taking the eggs to the grocer and trading them for food staples for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending the afternoon shoveling chicken manure from the chicken house could net a nickel or a dime for Dorothy 's bank , which she kept on the piano in the parlor . Dad could n't afford to buy enough cigarettes to develop lung cancer , heart disease , or emphysema . My dad did n't live long enough to die from his addiction , so I was left with only the happiest memories of tobacco use . Dad would pipe dream with his favorite corncob pipe : " If I were suddenly a millionaire I would n't tell . I would just go to town in my new Chevrolet with lighted cigarettes and people would wonder how I could afford it , " he 'd say . His idea of luxury was to show off with plenty of smokes . My ideas of smoking prestige came later when I became a plebe at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis . My sister Cory , who had been working in Gov . Bourke Hickenlooper 's office , had sent me one of the governor 's forms for aspiring naval academy applicants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning was like Sunday morning on the farm . After the rigors of early-morning rising and unrelenting chores and livestock feeding , academy life was luxurious . The height of leisure was to sit with a cigarette in " Smoke Park , " where plebes ( freshmen ) could n't go . You had to earn the right to sit and smoke with the big boys in Smoke Park . Somewhere at that time smoking became such a status symbol to me that I was smoking in Smoke Park with the best of them . We did n't know about lung cancer then , much less about emphysema or heart disease from smoking . We did n't know then that nicotine is a severely addictive substance and that for some , it becomes impossible to drop this wicked lady . Just about everyone who mattered in my world smoked . Navy 's football coach smoked . Our professors smoked . Military heroes smoked . Uncle Sammade sure even the servicemen smoked . Cigarettes for the military during World War II , when they were n't free , were three cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to go on cruise with the real Navy , one of the prize perks was being allowed to buy all the cigarettes we wanted for a few cents a pack . It made going on cruise with the Navy a ( coveted privilege . Later , we just gradually smoked more as pressures mounted . In dangerous waters 30 fathoms deep , where rival Russian subs could be lurking , pressures mounted often . We smoked . When carbon-monoxide levels became too high in the submarines , everyone might have to quit smoking temporarily , but when the air cleared we lit up again . If smoking on submarines was double jeopardy , we did n't know it . If submariners would end up more often with lung disease than non-submarine smokers , we did n't know . And probably never would . Who would waste time with such an expensive long-range study ? ( Do airline stewardesses and pilots who smoke die or suffer more from lung cancer and emphysema ? It will take about 20 years or more to learn the answer to that one . ) We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy was not the Russian surveillance sub watching us  --  the enemy was the deadly little white-and-brown weapon in our own hands . But we did n't know we were watching our good men commit suicide slowly  --  forsaking their posts . If we were forfeiting our country 's proud warriors to the enemy , we did n't know it . Promotion from sub duty to a desk job at the Pentagon might seem dull . But not if you happen to have responsibility for 140 American submarines all over the world ; not when a sub is almost always in trouble , somewhere ; not when you are trying to figure out what President Richard Nixon means when he tells our military commanders to instruct our forces to " lean forward in the trenches " as a warning to the Russians , and our submarines are already cheek by jowl with the Russians ' anyway . So the hours were long , and the tension levels high , and the cigarette smoke thicker . I was n't terribly concerned about my own health . I really never was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launchings with a few glasses of champagne and many lighted cigarettes . Life was good . Our families were young and we were their heroes when we returned home . Crete is also a treasure house of Byzantine-Orthodox church architecture ; indeed , motoring thorough the rugged Cretan countryside ( the roads themselves are excellent ) reveals a chapel in almost every stony , forlorn field or olive grove . Nearer the center of the island , as the road grows more tortuous , the snow-capped Mount Idhi ( 8,058 feet ) looms above such tiny peasant villages as Anogia , clinging to the hillsides . Clean , whitewashed Anogia makes a special effort to welcome visitors ambitious enough to make the trek ; the sale of sturdy ceramics and handwovens is an attractive supplement to the meager output of the barren fields . Even Iraklion , the somewhat prosaic capital and main seaport of the province , has a well-preserved Venetian castle plus some other brooding ruins , mostly from the days of the Turkish wars . And at Iraklion is found the museum with the most precious pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boredom or ennui at Elounda Beach . Even within the compound , Greek holidays and customs are observed , notably ancient Greek drama at the open-air theater , as well as Greek Easter , the height of the social season ( usually held later than our Easter because of the medieval calendar of the Orthodox church ) . Water sports , of course , are available in profusion , and beaches ring the island  --  starting at , of course , Elounda Beach itself . ? Robin Roberts Admiral continued from page 62 shape , and he would n't see me next year , and I would n't even be an active naval officer by next summer . A month after this clean bill of health , I turned myself in , so to speak . I went to the Navy physician and said , " If I 'm going to be climbing stairs on the submarines , I may have a problem . " The crew always walks faster when an admiral is aboard , and / feared not being able to keep up . How does an officer stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is showing off a shipshape submarine ? The time is now early 1975 . There 's that annual physical , but the clean bill of health wo n't still the small voices . I was a little worried . While in Washington , we had to stay abreast of what was happening out in the field . I remember going up to Portsmouth , New Hampshire , to look at our submarines up there . It was wintertime , and I had a hard time climbing around those dry docks . You know , when an admiral 's out in the field , they paint a spot just ahead of you , so you think the whole world smells like tacky paint . Fumes of fresh paint bother persons with compromised lung function . People also tend to walk fast when an admiral is on board , and so you tend to try to keep up . So instead of looking very military , I tended to be out of breath all the time . Three flights on a sub were winding me , and I told the physician my concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two-year stint in Italy ? Should he check me out fur-ther ? He did , and promptly he stamped my chart UNFIT FOR ACTIVE DUTY . ( This was only a few weeks after having passed my physical . ) Inch-high letters on my chart .. UNFIT ! He picked up the phone and called my boss , commanding officer Admiral R.L.J. Long , then and there , and told him that I should be retired from active duty that afternoon . I had serious chronic emphysema , for which there is no cure  --  just the promise of a slow , suffocating death . I knew there was no way I could leave my post that afternoon . " Myboss will know that too , " I thought . I had the inflated idea that the Navy could n't get along without me ; you know , many of us have that problem . I went back that afternoon and talked it over with Admiral Long . There was some idea that I might just stay put , where I was . But I felt that was somehow wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good jobs in the Pentagon should be a guy who can aspire to going back to the fleet . I called my wife , my mother , and my sister , who by then had graduated from medical school and had given up sending me Nicoban . I flew to Indianapolis to be hyp-notized and gave up smoking . Ninety-five to 98 percent of severe emphy-sema is caused by smoking 20 pack-years ( a pack a day for 20 years ) , the pulmonary spe-cialists told me . I wondered why this fact is n't impressed upon all young smokers be-fore it is too late , preferably before the addiction begins . When my wife , Elaine , developed breast cancer soon thereafter , I was glad to be at home to take care of her . I spent more and more of my time helping her prepare to die , and I really felt it was a pretty worthwhile thing to do . Looking back at my life now , I 'm not sure the world is better or worse off because it has nuclear submarines . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife out of the world in a meaningful way . I tried to make all those days as pleasant as possible . At Elaine 's funeral our children could n't smoke around me , and they would n't dare smoke around my sister Cory , so they would excuse themselves and go often to the ladies ' room or the men 's room in the chapel at Arlington National Cemetery , where funeral services were held . No one was so crass as to ever mention it in my presence , but I knew what they were all thinking : My heavy smoking habit might have contributed to her cancer . I certainly felt heavy guilt about the possibility . A Japanese study had shown a 14 times greater incidence of cancer in women whose husbands smoked than in women whose spouses did not smoke . continued on page 100 old man , that 's for sure .

" " Thank you so much for bringing him . " " Do n't mention it . " " Sally ! What is it ? " Mr. McHugh called from the living room . " In a minute , dad . " Sally tucked the pup 's oversized paws in more securely and carried him up the steps . She shut the door of the apartment with her foot and stood for a second to catch her breath . " What were you --  " Mr. McHugh began and , seeing the pup , stopped . A frown of displeasure creased his forehead . Sally set the young dog down on his feet . He shook himself hard and lifted his head . He looked around the room slowly and spotted Mr. McHugh . Then he stepped across to the davenport , sat down before the old man with one haunch sprawled puppy fashion , and stared at him . Sally seated herself unobtrusively on the davenport . " Ben brought him , dad , " she explained . " I phoned him . " Mr. McHugh nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his hand . The pup got up and came toward him . He smelled his hand thoroughly ; then he set about licking each finger with his bright red tongue . Gradually the old man 's face softened , and almost unconsciously , he began to scratch the pup behind the ears in the exact place Liffey had liked to be scratched . The pup stood quietly , blinking with contentment . Finally he opened his mouth and yawned so hard he squealed . Mr. McHugh chuckled . " Are we keeping you up , boy ? " he asked . He smiled down at the dog and waved his arm in the direction of Liffey 's chair . " Have a seat , wo n't you ? " The pup twisted his head quizzically , the way an Airedale does . Then he turned deliberately and stepped across the room to Liffey 's chair . He sniffed it thoroughly and climbed up on the seat . Having settled himself comfortably , he arched his neck so that the tip of his chin reached the arm . Sally glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pup , his face relaxed and softened . Then she , too , looked over at the dog . The bright light of the nearby lamp shone on his jet-black saddle and brought out the golden brown of his muzzle and sprawling paws . " He 's sort of fresh and new looking , is n't he , dad ? " she commented . " He moved in fast enough , if that 's what you mean , " Mr. McHugh replied , and he began to hum a tune . " Know that one ? " he asked . Sally shook her head . " ' Where the River Shannon 's flowing , ' " her father sang in a voice that quavered slightly . " ' Where the three-leafed shamrock grows . ' Shannon ! That 's what I 'm going to call him . " He picked up one of the candy bars , broke it in half , and handed Sally the other piece . " I always name my dogs " ? he paused to take a generous bite of the candy ? " after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What angered me most , I guess , was seeing my own children addicted  --  unable to give it up  --  and seeing the company whose devilish wares had robbed me of my health still out displaying its evil weeds in the mouths of healthy , virile young men . " Marlboro " means impotency and death for country men . . . not clean , fresh air in the lungs . I 'm back where I started now , near the farm home in Pella , Iowa . " Gone home to die , " you might say . I have a marvelous bride , Lorraine , the hometown girl who loved me enough to mar-ry me in spite of my chronic , fatal illness . She was the ornery little clarinet player in the Pella Junior High band and the prettiest girl in high school . We double-dated be-fore she married . Her first hus-band is buried at Arlington National Cemetery , probably because his heart attack was induced from years of smoking plentiful Navy-supplied cig-arettes in his overseas military duty . I have oxygen coming into my lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nostrils . I should n't complain . I can afford port-able oxygen , so that if I can muster up the energy , I can walk to other parts of the house . My less-fortunate , lower-ranking shipmates who have come down with emphysema ca n't af-ford the luxury of a home " wired for oxygen , " so to speak . They are in VA hospitals by the thousands , some-times confined to their beds with wall oxygen outlets , because at month 's end there are n't enough funds for the VA hospitals to supply them with portable oxygen so they can get up to go to the dining room or the bathcontinued on following page 102 room . Chained to their beds , they live out their days in an agony worse than pain . . . air hunger ! With strangulation . Their " quality of life " is gone . A wife who nagged me to quit smoking . . . a nagging sister who sent admonishments and quitting aids . You might say naggers destroy the quality of life , but that 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and career in the Navy , but I could have had all that without the smoking , and it would n't have been cut short at age 47 . I could have had all the enjoyment without the cigarettes . I did n't need the " enjoyment " of those cigarettes . I could have had the stress-packed , action-packed exhilaration of serving on the first nuclear sub , the Nautili 's ; of building the first nuclear-powered frigate ; of commanding nuclear subs and of achieving flag-officer rank in the Navy . I did n't need the cigarettes one bit . Smokers know about naggers  --  their wives , their children , their mothers , their sisters , and their lovers . Listen to those who love you and pray to God for strength to fight the addiction . Do n't accuse your loved ones of destroying your " quality of life " by having to be around you . Do n't call your wife a common scold . The " quality of life " when the destruction from smoking catches up is so poor that last week I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God wants men to live in this agony , " I told Lorraine after she found me and hooked up the lifesaving tubes again . Smokers , if you can still breathe freely , take a deep breath  --  a long , beautiful , painless , deep breath  --  and pray to God for strength to fight your addiction to nicotine . Nicoban was not worth trying . It contained no nicotine fix . Today Nicorette does contain nicotine  --  the equivalent nicotine of two cigarettes , enough for a nicotine fix , to satisfy your physically addicted cells while you handle the emotional and psychological dependence . It worked for my children . A smoker is a fool not to use it . Then pray to God that you will be one of the 40 percent who use it and who are able to overcome their addiction by using it . // Last week I pulled my cord , but today I have hope again .

The work of sucking the oxygen down from my nostrils into my lungs is more than my oxygen-starved muscles can accomplish . I have hope that I can again breathe enough air to think clearly .
