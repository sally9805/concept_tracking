American readers love lonely guys , with their emotional weightlessness and tender detachments . Given such an edge , Richard Ford should have little trouble becoming a literary heartthrob . Author of two earlier novels , A Piece of My Heart and The Ultimate Good Luck , he has already demonstrated his storytelling abilities and technical skills . He has also cultivated an engaging narrative voice , one of those down-home deliveries that can sound like Huck Finn with a college education . <P> Twenty years ago , Frank Bascombe , hero of Ford 's new novel , probably would have been a college English instructor with a stalled novel , a broken marriage and a string of women who leave him anesthetized and wistful . That was when the literary man was something of a culture hero . Bascombe has given up on that idea , although he retains some of the baggage : he has an abandoned novel titled Tangier , an ex-wife whom he calls X , and Vicki , a good ole girl from Texas who is a nurse and an effective pain killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interviews athletes for a weekly sports magazine .

She is a gifted golfer with hopes of joining the L.P.G.A. tour . There are two other Bascombe children who live with her in a new development house . Frank has kept the old Tudor residence rather than move to Manhattan . He rents the top floor to a Gabonese theology student , belongs to a divorced men 's club and strives to be ordinary . <P> The difficulty is that other people think he is special . As a writer , Bascombe is supposed to be smart and sensitive . But mostly he feels dumb and dreamy , " a state of suspended recognition , and a response to too much useless and complicated factuality . " Not a good state for a sportswriter . But as a fictional character dealing with loss and solitude , Bascombe accounts for many affecting moments . His attempt to interview a former football player confined to a wheelchair is every journalist 's nightmare : a hostile subject who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that chilling instant when involved parties realize they have little in common .
