Once Paul Simon ' s South African-inspired album , " Graceland , " proved that South African grooves could reach a worldwide audience , some record companies began looking into undiluted South African music . With a recent film about the anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko , " Cry Freedom , " and a South African musical , " Sarafina , " on Broadway , South Africa now has a greater presence in American culture than at any time since Miriam Makeba ' s ascendance in the early 1960 ' s. // Before " Graceland , " only a handful of South African albums were available here . The United Nations cultural boycott of South Africa intends to isolate the apartheid regime by insisting that performers not visit South Africa ; indirectly , it may also have prevented record companies from considering contact with their South African counterparts. // The boycott is still in force , but by recording South African musicians outside the country and by dealing with British packagers and subsidiaries rather than directly with South African businesses , record companies are finding more ways to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , in addition , listeners are unlikely to construe the seemingly buoyant , three-chord bounce of Soweto ' s mbaqanga dance music as acceptance of apartheid. // As more music becomes available , black South Africa ' s musical geography becomes a little clearer . South African popular music is no more monolithic than American or British music , two of its main outside sources ; in South Africa , as elsewhere , there are traditionalists and modernizers , rural styles and urban ones , regional music and fusions with an eye on the national and global market. // Ms. Makeba herself , who was exiled from South Africa in 1960 and was virtually blacklisted in the United States when she married the activist Stokely Carmichael in 1968 , has re-emerged , after appearing in the " Graceland " tour , with an album , " Sangoma , " and an autobiography ( " My Story , " New American Library ) . " Sangoma " ( Warner Bros. 25673 LP , cassette and CD ) is dedicated to Ms. Makeba ' s mother , a channel for spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zulu and Xhosa songs , traditionalist music realized with modern means. // Ms. Makeba sang all the complex , overlapping vocal parts of its 19 short songs ; then percussion ( including the traditional mbira , or thumb piano , alongside more modern instruments ) , keyboards ( including accordion and synthesizers ) and additional vocals were overdubbed . The performances are , thus , a far cry from traditional , real-time community singing - but they are charged with authentic passion . Ms. Makeba multiplies her voices ; there are grainy shouts , clear exhortations , Xhosa tongue-clicks , robust yodels , eerie bird-cries , surging harmonies and joyously unpredictable counterpoint. // Earlier in her career , Ms. Makeba sought to be pan-African and internationalist , but by going back to songs she learned as a child , she has made what may be her strongest album . The liner notes - essential if songs in Zulu and Xhosa are going to have their full impact here - are concise and illuminating , explaining how the songs are parables , ceremonies , carriers of history and restoratives. // Traditional South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rings out on " Let Their Voices Be Heard " ( Rounder 5024 , LP and cassette ) , a well-annotated sampler including songs from a Mothers ' Union induction and from a trio of nurses delivering nutritional advice in harmony . The sound isn ' t studio-clean , but there ' s extraordinary music : a fierce Venda song , performed by women , about a wife who is beaten for adultery ; Zulu choirs ( including an impromptu group of students at the University of Zululand ) with extraordinarily rich harmonies , and a congregation clapping hands and singing " Praise the Lord , Hallelujah , Amen ! " // Dr. Helen Kivnick , who recorded that album , also recorded an all-night singing competition held Nov. 18 , 1984 , in a miners ' hostel in Durban for " Mbube " ( Rounder 5023 ) - a night of robust , precise call-and-response singing . The melodies come from Zulu traditions , gospel hymns and 1950 ' s rock-and-roll ; the spirited performances often bely the subject matter : the loneliness and poverty of the miners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the listener who won the contest. // Professional popular music - played by electrified bands , recorded in studios - has also been showing up in American record stores . There are three recent samplers : " Homeland " ( Rounder 5009 , LP and cassette ) , " Thunder Before Dawn " ( Virgin 908866 LP , cassette and CD ) and " Sounds of Soweto " ( Capitol CLB 46698 LP , cassette and CD ) . // " Homeland " is the best and most varied of the three , although it doesn ' t translate or summarize the lyrics . There ' s choral singing that ' s only a step away from the performances on " Mbube " ; there ' s stark , accordion-driven pop from Lesotho , the independent black-ruled country surrounded by South Africa ; there ' s sax jive - African funk with saxophone melodies rather than vocals - from the Boyoyo Boys ; there ' s Zulu pop , with tickling guitars , sliding fiddle riffs and tradititionalist melodies , and there ' s the urban , three-chord pop of mbaqanga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mbaqanga band of Elias Mathebula and the Chivani Sisters ( Mr. Mathebula ' s four wives ) is a treat , especially one selection sung by the Sisters alone . Rounder has also released a full album by the Boyoyo Boys , " Back in Town " ( Rounder 5026 LP and cassette ) , 10 sax jive tunes , each exactly three minutes long , that are as irresistible and as interchangeable as James Brown instrumentals. // " Thunder Before Dawn , " a dozen songs recorded between 1983 and 1985 , has exemplary notes , but it relies too heavily on three interlocking mbaqanga groups , Amaswazi Emvelo , the Makgona Tsohle Band and Mahlathini Nezintombi Zomgqashiyo - a group featuring Simon ( Mahlathini ) Nkabinde , a South African superstar " groaner " with a voice so deep and alluvial it could have sprung out of a swamp , answered by the clear harmonies of the Mahotella Queens. // Mahlathini may be familiar to American listeners from two earlier mbaqanga collections , " The Indestructible Beat of Soweto " ( Shanachie 43033 , LP , cassette and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4415 , album and cassette ) ; now , there ' s a full-length 1970 ' s Mahlathini album , " The Lion of Soweto " ( Virgin 90867 LP , cassette and CD ) , with translations and informative notes that are coy , however , about when the album was made. // " Sounds of Soweto , " a collection of recent South African singles , is far more uneven - an album of Westward-looking pop with most of its lyrics in English , riding on synthesizer grooves that are usually closer to funk and reggae than to mbaqanga . Mara Louw and Supa Frika and Condry Ziqubu are the album ' s best performers , largely by default . There ' s better current mbaqanga ( along with Zulu-style choral singing ) on the original-cast recording of " Sarafina " ( Shanachie 43052 LP , cassette and CD ) , although the group of children ' s voices has a diffuse sound in the recording. // By the time South African music gets to the United States via annotators and repackagers , it can be fairly long in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind not knowing what singers are singing about - or listeners who speak Zulu , Sotho , Xhosa or Shangaan - a few fairly current albums from South Africa ( via Great Britain ) and Lesotho are now available here from the New Music Distribution Service ( 500 Broadway , New York , N.Y. 10012 ) . // " Icala " ( Soul Brothers MXH 1 , LP only ) is a 1985 album by Imitshotshovu , the mbaqanga backup band for a popular South African vocal group , the Soul Brothers . Like " Sounds of Soweto , " " Icala " shows synthesizers , drum machines and modern studio techniques working their way into mbaqanga ; the vocals , in velvety harmonies , are all by one singer . But Imitshotshovu bends the machines to its own purposes ; " Icala " simmers smoothly and never loses its South African flavor. // The Shangaan pop of Hlengani Thomas Maluleka and the Matshika Swi Endlile Sisters bounces along more briskly - and often in odd meters - on the 1986 " Minga Kayeli " ( Drum Rock DRL 121 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious as they are complicated , sputtering cross-rhythms between guitar , keyboards , upper-register bass and what may be a drum machine. // Synthesizers have even infiltrated more rural Zulu styles . The three members of Fihlamihlazo Nabochwepheshe hold a guitar , an accordion and a fiddle with a curved bow - the instruments of Zulu street bands - on the cover of their 1985 album " Ziphansi Izinsizwa " ( Vulindlela VUL 6004 ) , and the songs still have rough-hewn vocal harmonies above homey , wheezy riffs . But every now and then a light yowl of synthesizer floats into the mix , sounding right at home . A different ancient-modern hybrid comes from the group Malombo on " Malombo " ( Kaya 300 , LP only ) ; the guitarist Philip Tabane and two percussionists play serene , jazz-tinged instrumentals with African undercurrents. // Finally , fans of Gulf Coast zydeco music ought to investigate Lesotho ' s accordion-centered pop : stark , modal riffs , a trotting beat and vocals that might use short melodic hooks or spoken exhortations . Ruthla Masupha ' s " 6 " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service ) is gruff and hearty ; Puseletso Seema and Tau Ea Linare ' s " He O Oe Oe ! " ( Globestyle ORB 003 import ) , which has more informative liner notes , is a little more exuberant thanks to Ms. Seema ' s high , quavering voice . With any luck , these albums will be just the beginning of America ' s Southern African education. //
