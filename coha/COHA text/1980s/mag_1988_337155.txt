Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev were dining with Margaret and Denis Thatcher during their 1984 visit to Britain , and the talk got around to the working class . In his country , the Soviet leader-to-be asserted , " we are all working class . " <P> " No , we are not , " his wife objected . " You are a lawyer . " Gorbachev conceded , " Perhaps you are right . Perhaps it is just a sociological term . " <P> That exchange has never been reported in the Soviet Union , nor was Gorbachev 's confirmation to Tom Brokaw last month that he discussed " Soviet affairs at the highest level " with Raisa . If it were known that Raisa had once contradicted her husband before a foreign leader  --  well , that could only add to the whispered accusations that Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev , 55 , is guilty of conduct unbecoming a Soviet wife . In a land where women have full equality under the law but where a husband has the last word , Raisa has become a widely respected but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard to understand . So what if Raisa dresses stylishly , accompanies her husband on official travels in the Soviet Union and abroad and even makes some appearances on her own ? So what if she is involved in public policy to the extent of helping to create a fund to encourage the development of young people in the arts ? The problem is that the Soviets are accustomed to leaders ' wives who are retiring to the point of invisibility . The outside world did not even know that Tatyana Andropov existed until she attended her husband 's 1984 funeral . Consequently , to some people Raisa 's high profile seems mildly scandalous . When she accompanied Gorbachev to the 1986 Reykjavik summit with Ronald Reagan ( Nancy stayed home ) , a Soviet Foreign Ministry official griped , " Who chose her to represent the Soviet Union ? " A young Moscow professional woman complains that on a Gorbachev visit in September to the port city of Murmansk , Raisa was seen in two different outfits the same day : " That may be O.K. for Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter only once a month . " <P> Raisa is rarely mentioned by name in the Soviet press . She was born in the Siberian town of Rubtsovsk in Altai Krai , though she told reporters at a parade in Moscow last month that she is " absolutely Russian . " According to her official biography , her father was a railway engineer . Raisa 's chosen profession is teaching . When the newly married Gorbachevs moved to Stavropol in 1955 , Raisa found a job at a local school and continued to teach for the next 23 years . When her husband was summoned back to Moscow in 1978 to take charge of Soviet agriculture , Raisa became a lecturer in Marxist-Leninist philosophy at Moscow State University . Though she gave up the post after Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985 , she evidently remains very much the intellectual , accompanying Mikhail to cultural performances and displaying a command of foreign books . During the December summit she told Joyce Carol Oates that she had read the novelist 's book Angel of Light and said it was well liked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
