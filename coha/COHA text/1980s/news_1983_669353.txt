When the law permitted , mass marches and cross-country caravans were staged . Today they must stand solo , propping up placards of protest . But always there is dignity , and the trademark - a black sash draped across one shoulder. // That perseverance has made the Black Sash one of South Africa ' s most enduring , respected , and effective protest organizations . Although most of its members are white , it has built bridges to blacks across what appeared uncrossable chasms of legally enforced segregation and discrimination . Made up of women , the group has put feminism to work in a society still overtly partial to the opposite sex. // In a phase of South African history that most whites appear to perceive as one of ' ' reform , ' ' the Black Sash has been thrust to the forefront once again . President Sheena Duncan - daughter of one of the Sash ' s founders and the dominant force in the group over the past eight years - says the twin goals of helping blacks cope with what is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' ' reform ' ' among whites have never been so urgent. // ' ' We are finding that we have a great use right now , ' ' Mrs. Duncan said. // History seems to be testing anew the depth of the Black Sash ' s commitment . The group was formed in 1955 when the National Party manipulated the Constitution to exclude Coloreds ( persons of mixed race ) from the voting roll. // Today ' s ruling Nationalists are moving to give the franchise back to Coloreds as well as to Indians under a proposed new constitution . But the black majority would still be excluded. // However attractive broadening the vote may be , the Black Sash strongly opposes the proposal . The group detects the same end - albeit by different means - as that sought in 1955 : to more deeply entrench apartheid. // As has been the case through most of its history , the Black Sash is swimming against the current of white opinion . Whites massively approved the constitution in a recent referendum. // Duncan concludes that whites were not duped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were voting ' yes ' because they think this is a very clever way of maintaining white power while improving the lot of the Coloreds. ' ' // Duncan is distressed at the vote and convinced the new constitution - which may still be put to a vote of Indian and Colored South Africans - would seriously worsen race relations in this country . But a self-avowed optimist , she is upbeat about a number of developments. // In her view , black politics is passing out of the ' ' black consciousness ' ' phase , with its emphasis on black self-assertion and exclusion of whites , into a more embracive phase . Duncan supported black consciousness and Black Sash tried to sensitize whites to black grievances . She is delighted to see blacks and whites working more closely together again. // ' ' In our office now it is really exciting , people are buzzing in and out . There is a kind of unity not seen since the ' defiance campaign ' of the early 1950s , ' ' she said , referring to the period when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through civil disobedience. // The emerging black activists of today are ' ' democrats in the true sense of the word . They aren ' t haters , ' ' Duncan says . She is encouraged by the organizational depth of new groups like the United Democratic Front - formed by blacks and Coloreds to oppose the new constitution - and by their toned-down rhetoric. // Standing in protest , with their sashes as symbols of mourning , is a small part of Black Sash activities these days , partly because outdoor political assembly is outlawed . Most of the Sash ' s energy is poured into helping blacks find their way through the warren of restrictions that govern almost every aspect of their lives , and exercise what rights they do have. // This work puts Sash workers in a unique position here . They know - as much as any white can - what it is like to be a black in this white-ruled society. // In the Johannesburg office alone , more than 12 , 000 cases were taken up last year . Highly complex legislation , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to essentials and understood in a way that can be clearly explained to the largely uneducated blacks who come to the Black Sash for guidance. // There are eight advice offices in the country , run voluntarily by Sash women , save for a few paid staffers. // Although she has no legal training , Duncan has distinguished herself in the translation of legislation and making sense of regulations . Academics , journalists , and attorneys routinely seek her expertise on how new legislation or regulations will affect blacks. // For instance , when the government unveiled its progressive-sounding ' ' Orderly Movement and Settlement of Black Persons ' ' bill in 1982 - which actually proposed a severe tightening of the pass laws here - it was the Sash that sounded the alarm . The legislation has been shelved but may be reintroduced. // Such experience has convinced Duncan that the South African government is is using subterfuge . The government speaks of reform and on some issues , if looked at in isolation , is acting in a mildly reformist manner , she says . But viewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically and politically exclude the majority of blacks from what is deemed ' ' white ' ' South Africa , while coopting and rigidly controlling the small segment of ' ' urban ' ' blacks who are needed in the economy. // The question often asked about South Africa is whether change that is taking place is real reform or just cosmetic . The answer , Duncan says , ' ' is neither . ' ' The changes are fundamental , but ' ' the aim is to make apartheid irreversible. ' ' // Her view is regarded as extreme by most whites here . But even her critics concede her arguments are bolstered by an understanding of laws and regulations. // If there has been a criticism of the Black Sash over the years by more radical activists , it is that it has focused more on what some would call softening the harshness of apartheid than on providing a vision of the future. // ' ' We have no illusion that ( the Black Sash ) is going to achieve democracy in this country . But we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The focus of the Black Sash stems from its firm philosophy of nonviolence . ' ' If you say you are committed to nonviolence , you have to demonstrate that there are other and more efficient ways of setting about winning rights , ' ' said Duncan. // Two cases of blacks trying to exercise their rights and being thwarted by bureaucracy have led to important court rulings upholding the rights of blacks . Both cases started in Black Sash offices. // The strategic implications of blacks learning to exercise their rights is long-term , according to Duncan . Even with the coming of black-majority rule to South Africa , she feels democracy will not work unless ' ' people know that they have rights and know how to work for them. ' ' // In the arena of white politics , the Sash endorsed the idea of a universal franchise in South Africa before the opposition Progressive Federal Party did , she points out. // That the Black Sash has survived since 1955 puts it in rather elite company among protest groups . Most have crumbled under government crackdowns. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , females has helped the Black Sash survive , said Duncan . ' ' Even people who don ' t agree with us would be a little horrified if they shoved us into jail. ' ' // In its early days the Black Sash had 10 , 000 members . Most of those were English-speakers worried about their own rights . Duncan says the Sash has shed that element . Today it is growing again , but has about 2 , 000 members. // //
