" The situation seems a little calmer now , " said the teacher , who was closely associated with the democracy movement . " Nobody from the police has come looking for me , and for now life is less frightening. " // For the teacher , and for many other participants in the democracy movement interviewed recently , the raw fear of imminent arrest or even execution has dissipated . They say the atmosphere of terror has subsided , replaced by a dull apprehension that the next few years will be painful ones , economically and politically , for the nation and for themselves. // " The fear of immediate arrest , that first terror , is gone , " said a Communist Party official who supported the democracy movement . " We ' re afraid , but now the fears are different . People are concerned that their work is wasted . They ' re afraid of losing their jobs or of being transferred to the countryside. " // There are few arrests these days , and many of those who were detained shortly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions not to discuss their experience or talk to foreigners. // Today the authorities loosened rules against private enterprise , encouraging the unemployed to go into business or form collectives . Page 3. // But repression continues in spasms , and one Chinese intellectual was arrested just 10 days ago , according to a colleague who asked that the man ' s name not be published for fear of getting him in worse trouble . The arrested man had not been detained previously , although in June his passport was seized just two days before he was going to fly to the United States. // For the most part , however , participants in the democracy movement say they now believe that they probably do not face imprisonment . This belief is giving them new courage to emerge from hiding and to meet foreigners and tell their stories. // " Maybe I ' ll be kicked out of the Communist Party , " a lawyer said last week after resuming contact with a foreign friend for the first time since the crackdown . " But at least I ' m pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prison . " <> <> Feeling Less Intimidation // The lawyer , who played a role in the democracy movement , fled the capital after the killings in Beijing in early June . He recently returned and has been forced to write self-criticisms , but so far his case is being handled only by his work unit ' s authorities , not by the police. // Indeed , he is so little intimidated that his self-criticisms have been mostly criticisms of the Government . The latest version that he submitted will probably make things worse , he acknowledged , but he is reluctant to repudiate his beliefs. // Another intellectual said this to his interrogators : " I ' m not going to recant my views this time . In the anti-rightist campaign and in the Cultural Revolution , I made self-criticisms even though I didn ' t mean what I said . But I ' m not going to do that again . This time I ' m going to say what I think . I ' m through with lying. " // The renewed courage does not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes violent resistance to martial law troops has diminished in recent months . Most people interviewed , however resentful , say it is best simply to wait out the storm and try to make money or perhaps find a way to go abroad. // They say that terror faded during the autumn as people realized that the crackdown was not as comprehensive as had been originally feared . Most estimates of the number of people arrested range from 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 , many of whom have since been released . The majority of these appear to have been workers who were accused of taking part in violence , rather than intellectuals who helped organize the protests. // The intellectual bulwarks of the democracy movement experienced relatively few arrests . At the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , with a staff of more than 5 , 000 , about five people were arrested . About a dozen journalists are known to have been arrested in all of China. // At Beijing University , estimates of the number arrested range from about a dozen to nearly 100 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . Among Beijing ' s artists , many of whom joined the unrest , no one is known to have been arrested. // In the last few days , the Government has prepared a new arrest warrant for seven people it terms " criminal ringleaders of the counterrevolutionary rebellion , " but the document does not signal any extension of the crackdown . On the contrary , it seems to reflect the Government ' s frustration that dissidents have been so successful in slipping through the authorities ' dragnet. // The warrant , which was obtained in Beijing from a Chinese with connections in the Public Security Bureau , names people who have been wanted for some time. // The most prominent person on the list is Chai Ling , a 23-year-old psychology student whose tearful interviews earned her a measure of fame abroad . There had been rumors that Miss Chai had either been arrested or had fled abroad , but the warrant indicates that she has not been arrested and that the Chinese authorities believe that she is still in the country . <> <> Tension Eases at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a senior official who was associated with the democracy movement was summoned to a top-level meeting shortly after the crackdown , he feared it was a ploy to arrest him quietly . His aides told his driver that if there were no other cars at the supposed site of the meeting , then he should immediately leave without stopping. // There were other cars , and it really was a meeting . The official found himself criticized and humiliated before his peers , but he was not arrested . These days , his influence is gone and life bears little joy , but he has been allowed to retain his title and most of his privileges. // Within the Communist Party bureaucracy , there have been a few people arrested - including Wu Jiaxiang , a theorist and essayist , who was seized on July 17 , a friend of his confirmed this week - but now cadres say the fear is more of party disciplinary measures than of arrest. // " The situation is getting a little easier , and I don ' t think I ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed sympathy for the student demands in May and consequently spent the summer searching for an escape route to the United States . " I think I ' ll stick it out. " // In these circumstances , the mood is far from cheeful , and some believe that the punishments will come later , after investigations are complete . For many intellectuals who felt that they were involved in the grand enterprise of rebuilding China , it is little consolation that they are at liberty if their ideas are ignored. // " I think I ' ll be able to resolve my problems , " said a social scientist who has been reproached for his conduct in the democracy movement . " But who will dare publish my book ? " //
