What a life it 's like I no longer exist cause no one loves me . So When I die , I 'll die because you 'll know that you caused me to die and you 'll be responsible .

CYNTHIA &amp; BARBARELLA ( Agreeing . ) Money and sex are definitely the main criteria . DANIELLE Sex ? CYNTHIA I think I want a wife who has a cock . You understand what I mean .

Even though none of us is getting anything right now , except for Danielle who 's getting everything , our desires are totally volatile . DANIELLE I ca n't be a wife . I can be a hostess . If I 've got lots of money . CYNTHIA I think if you really worship sex , you do n't fuck around . Danielle fucks around more than any of us and she 's the one who does n't care about sex . p. 14 BARBARELLA Most men do n't like sex . They like being powerful and when you have good sex you lose all power . CYNTHIA I need sex to stay alive . ( A street in Rome . The sky 's color is deep dark blue . One star can be seen .

Moreover she 's had such a poverty-regulated life , she ca n't have the life in her to give me the female elegance and beauty I deserve.My girlfriend on the other hand , if anyone ever hurts me , is going to have to murder him .

PROPERTIUS What the he ( Grabbing the other girl into him . ) Oh , hello . I 'm busy now . CYNTHIA I just wanted to see you . PROPERTIUS I 'm busy with someone now . I 'll give you a call tomorrow . CYNTHIA Please . ( There 's nothing she can do . ) O.K. ( Propertius and his girlfriend walk into the house . One of the dogs on the street starts barking . ) The street of Dogs .

CYNTHIA ( Barks like a dog . ) I ca n't help myself anymore I 'm just a girl I did n't ask God to be born a girl . If I think realistically , I know I 'm an alien existant .

Do n't talk to me otherwise . Do n't know me . Do you think I exist ? Watch out . Madness is a reality , not a perversion.Among these women , free yet timorous , addicted to late hours darkened rooms gambling indolence , sparing of words , all they needed was an allusion.I reveled in the quickness of their half-spoken threats more like the violent excitement of a teenager who does n't know what he feels . These exchanges as if once the slow-thinking male is banished every message from woman to woman is clear and overwhelming are few in kind and infallible.The first time I dined at her place , three brown tapers dripped waxen tears in tall candlesticks without dispelling the gloom . A low table , from the Orient , offered a pell-mell of les hors d'oeurve  --  strips of raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , salad seasoned with pepper and cranberry  --  there was a well-chosen Piper Heidsieck brut and very strong Russian Greek and Chinese alcohols . I did n't believe I 'd become friends with this woman who tossed off her drink with the obliviousness with which a person in the depths of opium watches his hand burn.The " master " is never referred to by the name of woman . We seemed to be waiting for some catastrophe to project herself into our midst , but she merely kept sending invisible messengers laden with jades , enamels , laquers , furs From one marvel to another Who is the dark origin of all this nonsense ?

They 're goddamn sluts because the only thing they 've got going for them are their cunts.The worse thing about women is all these emotions . Take the hole I slept with last night . Sure , she moaned hard when I stuck my dick in her . But did she have any idea that I did n't feel ? Sure , I 'm a macho pig . Why should I pretend I 'm something I 'm not I care about art . Everything but art is a second-class existent.Art , you are the black hole of vulnerability , you take everything from me and are not human . You can take me whenever you want me . A human has to care for one thing. I use whatever I can get from women . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish or insecurity and horniness to elephantine propertions . So the ugly is left ugly and consciousness ' unavoidable anguish is as it is in me.My writing will cure you of your suffering . I teach young girls how to win the love of men who do n't love them . I teach boys how to endure the lacerations of long red fingernails stuck in their face flesh and how to watch the girl they crawl under fuck another man right in front of their faces . p. 20 AUGUSTUS ( Through the lips of his literary counselor Maecenas . ) You 're not a poet and you 're not a real man because you write about emotion . Men are people who take care of the world , who care that people get enough to eat , who stop the greedy hawks at least from seizing more power and underhanded control.Artists who are men have to change the world . When they start paying attention to emotions , what are emotions ? , they 're helping the power hawks destroy the social bonds people need to live . PROPERTIUS Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am .

PROPERTIUS One day , Maecenas , you 're going to realize you 're not rational and then , suddenly ignorant desperate , you 'll leave your politics and run to me , ( Turns away from Maecenas. ) away from anything public , the art-world : a salon resplendent with gilding and illuminations . One has just revealed original talent and with this first portrait of his shows himself the equal of his teacher . A sculptor 's chatting with one of those clever satirists who refuse to recognize merit and think they 're smarter than anyone else . The people talk either about how they earn money or who 's becoming famous . All for good reason are grasping . Since the only ideas are for sale , none are mentioned .
