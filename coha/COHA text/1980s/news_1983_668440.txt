I saw the weary farmer , Plowing his sod and loam ; I heard the auction hammer Knockin ' down his home . - Woody Guthrie HARTFORD - Patient money . That ' s been the traditional source of farmlandinvestments . Last week , as the auction hammers of foreclosure continued to knock their way through small- and medium-sized farms , one of the nation ' s top ten insurance-based farm financers , Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance , finally lost its patience and shut down its agriculture investment division . Management of Conn . Mutual ' s $511 billion farmland portfolio will be taken over by AgriVest Inc. , a new company owned and operated by the former farm investment team at Conn . Mutual . Once flush with cash , the nation ' s life insurance companies have seen much of their money go out in policyholder loans almost as quickly as the premiums come in . This has been a particularly severe problem for companies such as Conn . Mutual , which have a bigger chunk of their business in individual life insurance policies than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Casualty Co . Moreover , Conn . Mutual has an upscale clientele that has quickly tuned in on the new investment options for individuals , such as money market funds and the Individual Retirement Accounts that offer tax benefits similar to whole life insurance . Also , like any investor , insurance companies have been reluctant to lock up their money in long-term , illiquid investments at a time when interest rates are so volatile . Prices tell the short story of the tightest squeeze on farming since the Depression . In 1971 , for example , a bushel of No. 2 corn sold for $1.86 . Today its up to $2.27 , hardly enough to keep up with the hike in farmland from levels of $100 an acre then to $1000 now , oil from $3.30 a barrel then to $31 now , or credit from 6-7 percent then to 12-14 percent now . Conn . Mutual isn ' t just your typical agriculture investment house , though . It began this line in 1860 and traditionally has led the insurance industry in the percentage of its assets invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years . It ' s written mortgages and purchased major farm properties from the citrus groves of Florida to the Imperial Valley of California . And it ' s made good money . Since World War II , average US agricultural landinvestments have had a compound annual yield of 11.7 percent , compared to common stocks at 10.3 percent and long- term corporate bonds at 2.2 percent , according to a University of Chicago study . Conn . Mutual has a reputation of doing better than average . Back in the 1970s when farmland prices were going up faster than inflation and interest rates were low , Conn . Mutual invested annually as much as $90 million in rural properties . But as interest rates have soared , many of its policyholders have borrowed against their policies at the favorable rates of 4 or 5 percent , leaving the firm with a sharply shrunken pool of investablefunds . " Like most life insurance companies in recent years we ' ve shifted our investment strategy to more emphasis on liquidity and shorter maturities in our investments , " Conn . Mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And this change in strategy meant we had to reduce the amount of money invested in agricultural properties . " Last year Conn . Mutual put only $15 million into farmland . Rather than simply lay off Conn . Mutual ' s highly regarded agricultural investment team , and perhaps see them take positions with competing investors , the company offered to help their staff organize into AgriVest Inc. , which was capitalized with a line of credit and a fee for managing Conn . Mutual ' s farm assets for the next three years . Conn . Mutual has no ownership of the new venture . AgriVest will be headed by George Schwab , a former Conn . Mutual vice president . Other top management will include former Conn . Mutual employees William Whitt , James McCandless and Rodney Moore as vice presidents . It ' s a measure of the liquidity squeeze on Conn . Mutual , that the company is being forced to cut its staff and slash its rural investments at a time that many agricultural analysts believe is at or near the market ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , is sticking in with a portfolio of more than $2 billion , even though they ' ve been disappointed in their recent efforts to to attract new institutional investors ( particularly pension funds ) to agriculture . Says Clarendon Richert , Hancock ' s vice president for agricultural investment : " I think over the long term , agriculture is a growth industry , is a good investment . . . I wouldn ' t want to divest , absolutely not . " In contrast , sources at Prudential Insurance indicate that the company is holding new agricultural loans down to the " minimum needed to take care of regular customers . " A few blocks from Conn . Mutual ' s home office in Hartford , Myron Sigaty , a vice president at Travelers Insurance Co. , says his firm , too , is " not looking to reduce " it ' s $2.25 billion portfolio of farmland investments . " Agriculture is in a serious profit bind , and there are problems with 10 percent of the portfolio , " Sigaty concedes . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ' re continuing to invest . " Land prices are off . So if you ' ve got money , and you ' re patient with your money , you can make some pretty good buys , " he said . " It ' s time . " Schwab , AgriVest ' s president , who hopes pension funds will provide a big chunk of business for his new firm , couldn ' t agree more . " Over the long term , the outlook is good . There is accelerating demand worldwide for American agricultural products . The projected rate of productivity gains in agriculture is expected to slow down . There is upward pressure on land values because of competing uses for suburban and urban expansion . All these factors point to consistent strong growth in agricultural real estate values . " What about the unrest , the penny auctions and riots over foreclosures ? " Most of the problems are with people who were highly leveraged , people who bet their farm against next year ' s crop , " said Harvard agribusiness Prof. Ray Goldberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions tend to invest in large-scale farms , which aren ' t as bad off as medium and small farms . Eventually , Goldberg says , agriculture will make a good profit again , and that will be reflected in land values .
