Before death ended his 51-year , three-pack-a-day habit in 1982 , Galbraith had filed a $1 million product-liability suit against R.J. Reynolds , contending that the company that marketed the Winstons and Camels he puffed so prodigiously fueled his addiction and thus killed him . But last week a jury in Santa Barbara , Calif. , voted 9 to 3 that Galbraith 's lawyer Melvin Belli had not proved that smoking necessarily caused Galbraith 's death or that he was a tobacco addict .
