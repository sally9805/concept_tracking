The bi-partisan compromise was approved in the House by a vote of 333 to 43 shortly after 11 P.M. Thursday , just over an hour after a House-Senate conference committee passed the proposal on a voice vote. // The Senate , with only four members present , approved the plan shortly after midnight on a voice vote . Both the House and the Senate then left for a two-week July Fourth recess. // // Three Days of Negotiations // In an effort to get around the President ' s opposition to tax increases , the budget resolution sets up a mechanism that would allow the President to get a higher military budget if he proposes revenue increases or new spending cuts to offset the increase . This increase , however , only slighty eases the deep cuts in the Pentagon ' s budget. // The budget resolution sets overall ceilings for spending and revenue . It does not require Presidential approval . The House and the Senate still have to approve the separate appropriations bills and other legislation to achieve the spending cuts . In addition , legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final plan . All these bills must go to Mr. Reagan for his approval . The breakthrough in the budget negotiations , after three weeks of deadlock , came early Thursday when the leaders of the two budget committees reached agreement on a " framework. " // The proposal , worked out in three days of negotiations by the leaders of the House and Senate Budget Committees , would cut Mr. Reagan ' s military budget request by $28 billion , leaving it just above this year ' s level . In addition , the plan rejects Mr. Reagan ' s proposals to end programs in all but two of 44 cases , drops many of his proposed sales of Federal assets and refuses to make the deep cuts in domestic programs that he has pursued in each of his budgets . <> <> Revenue Increases Are Dropped // However , the plan does drop $4. 8 billion in revenue increases proposed by the House and the Senate , bowing to the President ' s strong opposition to revenue increases beyond the $5. 9 billion he included in his 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House on the compromise . Senator Pete V. Domenici , the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of Senate Budget Committee , said the Administration would oppose the cuts in the military budget but would not reject the plan completely , in part because it reached the 1987 deficit ceiling and dropped $4. 8 billion in additonal revenue increases. // The budget plan is the first agreed to by the House and the Senate under the budget-balancing law passed last December . The projected deficit under the plan is $142. 6 billion , just under the $144 billion ceiling set for the fiscal year 1987 under the new law . Total spending is $995 billion , with revenues of $852. 4 billion . The threat of an automatic spending cut that the new law calls for was one of the driving forces behind the budget compromise . <> <> Automatic Spending Cuts // Although the projected deficit was cut below $144 billion , the negotiators acknowledged that revised estimates on economic activity and the failure to achieve some savings could raise the deficit and set off the automatic spending cut process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the law splits evenly between military and nonmilitary spending , has already been overturned by a three-judge appellate court panel in Washington , and the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the matter before the end of this term . If the Court rejects the procedure , there is an alternative that would go into effect if the deficit exceeds the ceiling by more than $10 billion . Under this procedure , the House and the Senate will have to vote on separate legislation to achieve the needed savings , and the President would have to sign or veto the cuts. // The agreement on the budget framework was reached shortly after 1 o ' clock Thursday morning by Mr. Domenici ; Representative William H. Gray 3d , a Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee ; Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee , and Representative Delbert L. Latta of Ohio , the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee . <> <> Some Last-Minute Problems // The four leaders went into private discussions when the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some last-minute problems over Medicare and an a few other issues delayed action until Thursday evening . But Senator Domenici said the agreement would hold . " We ' re going to get it done , " he said. // The four Senators on the floor when the measure was finally approved this morning were Bob Dole of Kansas , the Republican leader , Mr. Domenici , Mr. Chiles and Alan K. Simpson , Republican of Wyoming , who presided . When the Senate approves legislation on a voice vote no more than two Senators need be present. // One of the biggest difficulties in the negotiations was finding enough savings after the $4. 8 billion in revenue increases were dropped to get to a $144 billion deficit . In addition , savings had to be found to offset the spending increase initiatives favored by each house. // To do this , the Senate negotiators had to agree to more of the House ' s assets sales , which they had earlier said were not achievable . User fees , including those for the Coast Guard and inland waterways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion savings from early payment of Federal loans to rural electric cooperatives was counted , although over the long run the program could cost the Government more than $1 billion . <> <> Some Key Provisions // Among the major elements of the budget are : // * A mechanism that would make available as much as $4. 8 billion for " unmet critical needs , " including the military budget and domestic programs . This money would become available only if the President requests it and proposes spending cuts or revenue increases to pay for the additional spending . Congress would have to vote on any request made by the President . Of the total , $3 billion could be used for the military , and the balance for domestic spending . It appears that if the President proposed revenue increases so he could use the $4. 8 billion , they would be included in legislation separate from the tax overhaul bill just approved in the Senate. // * The military budget is $292. 15 billion in the fiscal year 1987 , $28 billion below the President ' s request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion military budget for the current fiscal year and above the $285 billion figure approved in the House . But it is not expected to be enough to cover the increase for inflation in 1987 . The President had requested an 8 percent increase on top of inflation . If he used the contingency fund , he could add $6. 85 billion in military appropriations and $3 billion in actual spending in 1987 for the military . However , the Pentagon budget would still be far below Mr. Reagan ' s intital request. // * Foreign aid programs would be cut about 10 percent below the current level , and far below the President ' s request . The House had cut foreign aid by about 11 percent below the 1986 level , and the Senate 7 percent . Overall spending on international affairs is $2. 5 billion less than that requested by Mr. Reagan . The budget plan does give the President his request for the next two years for increased embassy security. // * Medicare , the health care program for the elderly , would be cut by $700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees , including members of the armed forces , and for people on Federal pensions. // * The two terminated programs are Conrail and revenue sharing . <> <> Many Funds Are Frozen // Funds for many domestic programs , including all space programs , are frozen at the 1986 level . The budget provides no funds for a fourth space shuttle . Many other programs are cut 10 percent below the 1986 level , including Urban Development Action Grants and operating assistance for mass transit . Federal highway aid is cut 7. 5 percent . The House and the Senate had proposed a $13. 2 billion revenue increase , which was $7. 3 billion more than the President proposed . Based on the preliminary outline of the plan , $4. 8 billion of the revenue increases have been dropped . The plan does not specifiy how the revenue should be raised , but a large portion has already been achieved with the extension of the 16-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes.  --   --  Supplemental Budget Approved WASHINGTON , June 26 ( AP ) - Congress approved and sent to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide funds to keep several Government agencies running until Sept. 30 , the end of the 1986 fiscal year . The White House said Mr. Reagan was expected to sign the measure. // In the process , the Senate reversed itself and voted to restore $55. 6 million in non-competitive university research money which critics had labeled " pork-barrel science . " Lawmakers in both parties rejected a last-ditch effort to broaden a program of job retraining to include unemployed oil-field workers. // The spending measure was a compromise worked out after a week of private meetings between Senate and House negotiators . It includes a compromise on refinancing of billions of dollars in Federal loans to rural electric cooperatives . Until the compromise was reached , the issue had been considered a key stumbling block to approval by the President. // Included in the bill was $5. 3 billion to restore the flow of money to farmers from the Commodity Credit Corporation .
