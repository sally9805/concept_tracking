Not surprisingly , a musical titled Chess is already in the works for next year in London . The tunes may be catchy , but the story , based on this year 's championship confrontations in Moscow , can hardly be better theater than the real thing . Last weekend , on the stage of the opulent Tchaikovsky Hall , after two months of acrimony and audacity on and off the board , after jitterily watching his obdurate foe almost come from behind and after being driven all the way to the final game in the series , Gary Kasparov at 22 became the sport 's youngest world champion . He rang down the curtain on Anatoli Karpov 's decade-long top billing with a decisive , 42-move victory , to the obvious delight of a capacity crowd of 1,500 . <P> From the first act the histrionics of the protagonists seemed at least as tailored for the theatrical boards as for the chessboard : the cool and politically well-connected Karpov , 34 , defending his crown in his hometown , vs. the crowd-pleasing , passionate young provincial up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human loathing . Long before the end of the match , the contestants were barely speaking to each other , and shook hands perfunctorily . " The best part , " a chess master told the Chicago Tribune , " is that these guys hate each other ! " <P> The animosity began in a controversial and inconclusive match that was halted last February . Karpov was leading 5 games to 3 , but Kasparov appeared to be closing on him fast after a draining record of 40 draws . Then World Chess Federation President Florencio Campomanes , a close friend of Karpov 's , abruptly stopped play because , he said , players , officials and organizers were exhausted . The real reason , many insiders charged , was that the champion was physically and psychologically frazzled , ripe for a humiliating defeat . An enraged Kasparov shook his fist : " They are trying to deprive me of my chance ! " Later he sneeringly told the German magazine Der Spiegel : " Karpov views the title ' world champion ' as a natural prefix to his family name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each plays with a red Soviet flag on his side of the table . The darkly handsome Kasparov is a long-distance runner , pop-music buff and sharp dresser who regularly dates a striking blond stage actress , Marina Neolova . But another woman in his life has long been more important . After the death of his Jewish father Kim Wehistein , Kasparov took the maiden name of his Armenian mother Clara ; she has ruled his career ever since . At the championships she sat motionless each day in the same third-row seat , watching intensely . Though he now wears the crown , Kasparov , raised in the republic of Azerbaijan , 1,200 miles south of Moscow , remains an outsider to Moscow 's powerful chess establishment . " My relationship with the federation , " he concedes , " could n't be worse . " <P> Karpov , on the other hand , is what a Swiss newspaper called Homo sovieticus : a culture hero with close ties to the late leader Leonid Brezhnev , recipient of the Order of Lenin and a strong voice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of rare stamps , the chilly and distant Muscovite is a well-known ruble millionaire who is rumored to be a dollar one as well . Although he enjoys rare Soviet amenities like a mobile telephone in his car , Karpov does not ignite the imagination . " Style ? " he once puzzled . " I have no style . "
