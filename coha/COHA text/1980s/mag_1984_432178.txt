 | For 34-year-old divorcee Bertie Wilks , the American dream of home ownership has been anything but inspirational . Convinced that interest rates would rise sharply after the November elections , Wilks and her 16-year-old daughter recently began searching through their native Miami and finally located a spartan three-bedroom cinder-block dwelling priced at $54,000 . The first problem , however , was to come up with a $3,000 down payment ? an unusually small amount by industry standards . Wilks had accumulated $1,500 in the Dade County credit union and managed to borrow an additional $1,000 from her family , leaving $500 still to raise . Then there was the matter of a mortgage . Wilks finally found an institution that was willing to grant an adjustable-rate loan carrying a first-year charge of 10 percent . The $468 monthly payment should be affordable on her $21,000 salary as a word processor , but if interest rates rise , so will her costs . " Each year my mortgage will be adjusted , " worries Wilks . " That 's the thing I 'm scared about . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago Wilks and literally millions of other Americans would probably not have been able to afford any home at all . Soaring prices and interest rates had so devastated the housing industry that the Census Bureau was predicting a steady erosion of home ownership through the year 2000 . That forecast , however , proved to be a bit premature . While prices and interest rates are still high , the American housing industry is currently in the midst of a miraculous boom largely free of the speculative excesses of the late 1970s . With virtually no warning , new housing construction leaped by an unprecedented 62 percent last year . And despite a weather-induced drop in housing starts in March , builders were erecting new units at a sizzling annual rate of nearly 2 million during the first quarter of 1984 . Simultaneously , existing homes are turning over at the rate of 3 million a year , adding a broad-based vitality to the boom . Altogether , of the millions of housing units that changed hands last year , fully 40 percent of sales were to first-time buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This boom is solidly based on demographics and the need for personal housing , " says Jack Carlson , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors . Innovations : The transformation is so dramatic that many experts are still puzzled as to how it could have happened . What seems clear , however , is that the desire for housing is so powerful that it can quickly reshape institutions . Almost overnight , for example , Wall Street has become a major source of home financing : of the estimated $199 billion of new mortgage loans issued last year , approximately $168 billion was ultimately provided by investment institutions and wealthy investors from all over the world . Traditional lenders are also finding new ways to accommodate the huge demand for housing money . The most significant is the adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) , which provides for periodic changes in the interest that a borrower pays . In the past , long-term mortgage lenders were burned whenever the interest they paid for deposits exceeded the income on their fixed-rate loans . But an ARM shifts the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , lenders are willing to quote a lower initial rate . The impact is enormous . Salomon Brothers economist Joseph C. Hu calculates that 24 million families are qualified to buy a median-priced home with a 13.25 percent fixed-rate mortgage . However , at the 11 percent rate that more commonly'applies to the first year of an adjustable-rate mortgage , an additional 7 million families are qualified to buy the house . The idea has obviously caught on with borrowers : almost unheard of before 1980 , ARM 's now account for more than 60 percent of new mortgage commitments . Some housing officials fear , however , that the rapid acceptance of adjustable-rate mortgages is a mixed blessing at best . In some instances , they warn , borrowers who barely qualify for a loan at the low initial rate will be hard pressed to make their payments if interest rates rise . That has already begun to happen in the booming Texas market , where sales-hungry developers have occasionally offered first-year rates as low as 4.9 percent . Those rates , however , move inexorably too market levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as 65 percent in a single year . Adjustable-rate mortgages were first introduced in the Dallas area in 1981 , for example , but it was only recently that the higher rates began to pinch . " Some people said to themselves , Hey , wait a minute ' , " says Michael Sugrue , vice president of Vernon Financial Corp . " So they put their houses up for sale . " Federal mortgage officials have also become concerned about the abuse of adjustable-rate mortgages , and in a series of speeches and interviews last week they were preparing a campaign to pressure lenders to limit potential payment increases and educate potential mortgage borrowers about the dangers of future payment shock . For the moment , however , housing re-@#  | mains more affordable than it has been in years . For one thing , calculates Carlson , continuing double-digit interest rates and the past housing recession have knocked 15 percent off the price of existing housing . Most homeowners are not aware of that loss because few of them sell in any given year . But the decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , says Carlson , " has been a boon to first-time buyers . " As a result , the median price paid by all home buyers in 1983 was $65,000 , compared with S72,000 in 1981 . In addition , while most buyers arranged creative financing rather than paying the 15 to 17 percent mortgage rates that were being quoted in 1980 and 1981 , interest rates have fallen sharply to an average of 12.2 percent last year . For that reason , the median monthly payment , including mortgage , taxes , utilities and insurance , dropped to $709 for houses bought in 1983 from $816 for houses bought two years earlier . Those median numbers conceal a host of bargains . More than 30 percent of the houses sold last year went for less than $50,000 ; an additional 10 percent sold for less than $30,000 . And there are bargains on a grander scale as well . In Miami , for example , luxury condos originally intended for wealthy Latin Americans have fallen victim to the Third World debt crisis . Some beach-front apartments are now languishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . In addition , numerous home buyers are going out of their way in their efforts to make housing affordable ? and some of them are doing it literally . With a median housing price of $140,000 in congested metropolitan Los Angeles , increasing numbers of people are moving to the most distant suburbs . According to southern California real-estate agent Mark Frazier , the one-way commuting time for many downtown workers has risen from 20 to 30 minutes 10 years ago to as much an hour and a half today . Closer to the cities , many home buyers are often forced to settle for less : last year the median size of a newly built house was 1,536 square feet , down 130 square feet from 1981 . The reason is clear : at a construction cost of $75 per square foot , that reduction in space can cut house prices by nearly $10,000 . Raising Cash : The need to contain costs is also producing a revolution in the building industry . As recently as a decade ago , most builders were merely well-dressed carpenters who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tools . But no longer . Today 's most successful builders are intensely market oriented and must have substantial expertise in finance . " When I got into this business 28 years ago , our financing plan amounted to telling people , I think there 's a bank on the corner ' , " says Sheldon Lazar , an executive of United Development Co. of Chicago . But with finance charges such a crucial factor in making a deal , developers must be especially adept at @#  | obtaining large sums of capital . " We have to compete with everyone else looking for high-priced money , " says Ed Havlik , one of United 's two principals . " You 're seeing builders sponsor their own mortgagebacked bond issues and selling their own commercial paper to finance their operations . " It is only the big companies , however , that can afford such competition , and that , says Tony Dursey , president of the Home Builders Association of Metropolitan Denver , " has precluded a lot of small builders from being in the business today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of a house has begun to change . No longer is a dwelling conceived simply as a series of separate rooms ; instead , builders are using trendy new designs to create the impression of value in a small but expensive home . " We used to ask ourselves how much space we could give a buyer , " says Havlik . " Now we ask how we can squeeze the most living space out of every square foot . " United 's designs feature vaulted foyers , winding staircases and windows that stretch almost to the floor ? all in an attempt to fill houses with the illusion of exploding space . Meanwhile , builders rely on careful market research to identify those " luxuries " that are most likely to add to the perception of value . Bathrooms , for instance , are often huge affairs , complete with sunken tubs , whirlpool baths and plant boxes . And at least in model homes , says Barbara Lawson of the Denver Home Builders Association , " builders often use clear glass in showers so you get a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic to some buyers , builders around the country commonly offer such amenities as skylights and built-in wet bars . Bigness is also transforming the way the nation 's real-estate brokers operate . A year and a half ago , Sears , Roebuck and Co. began testing the concept of retail home buying at its store in Aurora , Colo . Aurora is the kind of sprawling , fast-growing community where residents must check the street number to make sure they 're home , and in that kind of an environment , the indoor shopping mall constitutes a kind of cultural hub . But even Sears had no idea of how quickly the operation would prosper . " The success has astonished us all , " says Charles Flower Jr. , regional manager of Sears 's Coldwell Banker real-estate subsidiary . The storefront operation attracted so much walk-in business , he says , that Sears now has a Coldwell Banker facility in every store in the Denver metropolitan area . Sears has a nationwide presence that seems an almost certain guarantee of success . " We provide free newspapers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that are the first thing they want to look at , " says Flower . " We send brochures on properties and have national statistics on price differences between cities that we update twice a year . " In arranging corporate relocations , Sears might offer to buy the houses of transferred employees , find them new houses , help move the furniture and even counsel spouses on how to find a job in the new location . In Atlanta , Coldwell Banker also offers customers discounts of up to 25 percent on furniture and appliances purchased at the local Sears store . " It makes a big difference , " Flower says . Recent increases in interest rates have raised some concern in the real-estate industry , but the general consensus is that the impact will be limited . Economist Michael Carliner of Chase Econometrics calculates that a 1-point increase in conventional mortgage rates might reduce housing starts by between 100,000 and 150,000 units a year . That is far less damage than might have occurred in the past . Bank deregulation has enabled the thrift institutions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of its cost . And to the extent that borrowers are willing to accept adjustable-ratemortgage terms , the thrifts are relatively free from interest-rate risk . Even fixed-rate mortgages have become a better deal for the lender as the government has assumed a greater role in turning traditional mortgages into tradable securities . The Government National Mortgage Association has taken the lead in insuring private mortgages , which are then bought by underwriters and packaged into standardized " pass-through certificates " that guarantee the holder a predictable and lucrative return . Others , like the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , perform a similar function , and a growing number of banks and other financial institutions are creating pass-through certificates of their own . As a result , lending institutions can sell their fixed-rate mortgages almost as soon as they are issued . The money is available for relending , and the issuer receives a healthy origination fee . The upshot , says Hu of Salomon Brothers , is that " money for mortgages will now always be available at a price . " But is home ownership worth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation we 've ever had , " says Bud Owings , a partner in United Development . " Thanks to high interest rates , they 're buying half the house they could have afforded a few years ago . They 're not satisfied with that , and I do n't blame them . " Many experts are convinced that it will be a long time before housing prices will ever again appreciate at anywhere close to the return that investors can now receive on their savings , and consequently , says Carliner , " people will find it more reasonable to rent . " Elation : Perhaps so , but that argument seems to miss a vital point . Just one year ago , Bill and Sara Allen began their search for an affordable first-time house near Boston . " It seems for the last year that 's all we 've thought about , " recalls Sara . " It became all-consuming . I was almost disgusted with myself for not being able to get it out of my system , but I could n't . " Last month , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-frame house in the Roslindale section of the city . The building needs repairs , and the Allens hope eventually to move up to something better . Still , Sara can hardly contain her elation : " I do n't have the keys in my hand yet , but it 's hard not to be excited . " Similar stories are being repeated all over the country , and as long as the excitement persists , it 's hard to believe that the American housing boom will not continue to roll briskly along .
