Friends ! Do you wake up dead each morning because you watched another of those old-fashioned westerns on the late show ? Have you stayed up past midnight to see High Noon ? Did you miss the bus to work because you caught Stagecoach at 3 a.m. ? Well , suffer from horse-opera hangover no more ! Now there 's Silverado , the Cuisinart western ! Silverado dices , splices , chops , co-opts , hones and clones every oater archetype in just 2 hr. 13 min. ; that 's less than 1% of the time it would take you to sit through the collected works of John Wayne ! And if you act now , we 'll throw in nine , yes , nine of the cinema 's rising stars  --  **104;17748;TOOLONG  --  almost none of whom look at home on the range ! That 's Silverado , friends ! The best of the western in one disposable film . ( From K-Tell , a division of Kasdan Industry . ) <P> Some movie genres will just not lie still under Lawrence Kasdan 's knife . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Body Heat ) , he has performed deft surgery on the Saturday-matinee serial and the film noir melodrama . But the western will not yield . Silverado sprays the buckshot of its four or five story lines across the screen with the abandon of a drunken galoot aiming at a barn door . Though the film interrupts its chases and shootouts to let some fine actors stare meaningfully or spit out a little sagebrush wisdom , it rarely allows them to build the camaraderie that an old cowhand like Gabby Hayes exuded with no sweat . Agreeable but never compelling , Silverado proves it takes more than love of the western to make a good one . Maybe the dudes at K-Tell were a mite too slick for the job .  --  By Richard Corliss
