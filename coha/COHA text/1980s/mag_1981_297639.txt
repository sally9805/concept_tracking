Probing a rape spree <P> He was the ringleader of a cross-country crime wave . Police believe the suspect , sometimes with accomplices , was responsible for as many as 130 cases of rape and robbery in twelve states . He usually wore a ski mask . Sometimes he and his confederates tied up the victim 's boyfriend or husband and left him within earshot while they committed the assault . As the toll mounted , no fewer than 26 law enforcement agencies from Florida to California joined in the investigation . <P> The breakthrough came last month when an off-duty Louisiana state trooper spotted a red Pontiac Trans Am in the town of Lake Charles that matched the description of a car sighted near the scene of a number of the attacks . The owner , John Simonis , 30 , was placed under surveillance for five days until authorities were confident that he was the " ski-mask rapist . " Once in custody , police said , he confessed involvement in 77 assaults . <P> Simonis was indicted last Monday by a La Salle Parish grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jena , La. , woman last September . Anxious to avoid a trial and the embarrassment it would cause his family , he pleaded guilty to armed robbery , aggravated burglary and unauthorized use of a stolen vehicle ; he was sentenced to 231 years in prison without parole . Simonis and two other Lake Charles men , John Glass Dickinson III , 26 , a pharmacist , and Frederick A. Boerman Jr. , 27 , a waiter and musician , were also indicted on charges connected with the double rapes of a mother and her 14-year-old daughter last June . Charges are expected to be filed against Simonis and Dickinson in at least seven other cities . Says Photographic Assistant Judy Christman , 23 , a former girlfriend of both men : " They loved the thrill of meanness , to have their adrenaline running so fast . "
