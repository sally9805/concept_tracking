Books everywhere are falling apart . Acids in the ink and the pulp devour the pages . The paper crumbles , powdered words in a few generations will blow away like dandelion fluff . Some computer-literate great-grandchild will hold the empty , mortal binding in his hands as if it were Yorick 's skull . <P> And yet sometimes we harbor a subversive suspicion that it does n't really matter . Once , we think , we were a people of the book . Now we begin to seem , perhaps irreparably , a people of the tube . The race of literary giants , the tyrant genius founders ( Homer , Tolstoi , Flaubert , Joyce , Proust and so-on ) , will of course be safely stowed away on microfilm:literature freeze-dried , the Great Books kept as curios of the culture , like shrunken heads . But the writing we tend to get now , books milling around aimlessly at the dead end of the post modern ( or wherever we technically find ourselves ) , seem somehow . . . inadequate . Our literature paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , we learn no more about the meaning of things from our " creative " writers than a child learns about wildlife by watching the disconsolate , paranoid polar bear in the Central Park Zoo . The brute scowls and flips a beer keg around his stagnant pool and dreams of killing someone : a perfect model of the literary life . <P> The English critic Cyril Connolly once suggested : " Let us reflect whether there be any living writer whose silence we would consider a literary disaster .

One has to listen hard to hear any real thunder in the books . <P> John Cheever died last month . A loss to American writing , but not really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We like to wonder if the Darwinian selections of Posterity will confirm our prejudices . The briefly Celebrated poet Delmore Schwartz once wrote , with a weather eye on his own coming obscurity : " No reputation is more than snowfall . It vanishes . " <P> But play the game anyway : Would it be anything like a literary disaster if Gore Vidal were suddenly to fall silent ? Easy : No . In fact , there is something to be said for the idea . What if John Updike were to stop writing ? A shame , but not a duster for American culture . Walker Percy ? Joyce Carol Gates ? Donald Barthelme ? No . Philip Roth ? Joseph Heller ? William Styron ? Truman Capote ? John Gardner ? John Irving ? Norman Mailer ? Stop It gets to be a pogrom . The mind flips through its card catalogue . Very few disastrous silences loom . <P> The conjectural game tangles the mind in difficulties antiworld speculations on the classics that an infinite number of monkeys might have composed on an infinite number of type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon himself , vanishing into a weird silence that for those who love his work has always felt like a small , sharp loss . Thomas Pynchon dwells somewhere in an aloof privacy in deep cover making metaphysical devices in his basement , like a terrorist who has gone into the fireworks business .
