Mexico , colorful and gay , remains a favorite vacation spot for Americans . But this country has a darker , seamier side that remains hidden from visitors . Deeply rooted problems - political , economic , social - are driving millions of its people illegally across the border into the United States. // // Economic difficulties here are so serious that some experts consider Mexico a ticking time bomb . They say that in another severe downturn , the country could erupt , and endanger US security. // A number of analysts warn that Mexico , the neglected stepchild of US foreign policy , urgently needs attention in Washington. // Robert Pastor , an Emory University specialist on Mexico , explains : ' ' Except for the Soviet Union , for strategic reasons , and Japan , for economic reasons , Mexico is our most important relationship , and our most difficult. ' ' // Mexico ' s problems are interrelated - widespread poverty , an exploding population , severe pollution , a seven-year economic decline , inefficient industries , corruption , lack of investment capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US. // ' ' If there is a problem in Mexico , there is probably no problem anywhere else in the world which will have more of an effect on the United States , ' ' Dr. Pastor says. // The professor wrote with Jorge Castaneda , a Mexican scholar , the new book , ' ' Limits to Friendship : The United States and Mexico. ' ' // Expanding population // George Grayson , an expert on Mexico at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg , Va. , says this country ' s most immediate problem is jobs . At least half the workers in Mexico are either unemployed , or underemployed. // Mexico ' s expanding population requires 1 million new jobs a year , Dr. Grayson says . Yet even in a good year , only 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 new jobs become available . That means at least 800 , 000 new workers each year are without jobs - and often without hope - if they stay in Mexico. // Many don ' t . Millions of young people already have fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials report a sharp rise in the number of illegal entries. // Pastor says even Mexicans who have jobs here often migrate to the US . A typical Mexican worker , even when exploited in the US , can earn 10 to 15 times what a similar job would pay in Mexico. // ' ' The US is a very powerful magnet , ' ' Pastor says. // These vast differences in wealth and opportunity between the US and Mexico fuel fears among some analysts , including US government experts . They warn that Mexico ' s problems could spill like a sudden torrent into the Southwestern US. // William Colby , former head of the Central Intelligence Agency , once shocked Mexico by calling that nation ' s population explosion ' ' the most obvious threat ' ' to the US . If population growth remains unabated in Mexico , he warned , the number of illegal immigrants could rise to 20 million by the year 2000 , and the US Border Patrol ' ' will not have enough bullets to stop them. ' ' // Pastor calls such comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colby ' s words have ' ' power . ' ' The threat of massive , uncontrolled immigration is very real : // ' ' If there is instability in Mexico , there would be no way that the United States could effectively contain it . We would immediately share the consequences. ' ' // Encouraging signs // Despite its problems , Grayson sees encouraging signs south of the border . He sees indications that the economy , political system , and media are being liberalized and made more competitive. // Grayson says the expansion of free enterprise , which now seems to be happening , could speed reform of the nation ' s political system , which has been dominated for decades by a single party. // Mexico ' s recent economic troubles , which began in 1981 , are primarily blamed for the exodus of millions of its people . At the beginning of this decade , Mexico was bubbling with new oil discoveries and petroleum prices were rising . Suddenly , prices plunged . The country ' s oil earnings fell by one-third . Prices dropped again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Grayson , who lectures at the State Department ' s Foreign Service Institute , says the decline in oil earnings was just part of the problem : ' ' The broader problem was that it was a highly protected economy , highly subsidized , with an inefficient state sector . A lot of state companies were running in the red and still do. ' ' // Grayson says Mexico had thrown up a wall of economic protectionism . Its companies were guarded from outside competition . The result : poor products and high prices. // The combination of falling oil prices and poor economic policy was devastating . In the past seven years , Mexico ' s economic output slipped backward 17 percent - just as millions of teenagers reached working age. // Capital outflows // The immense foreign debt built up before the oil bust requires steep interest payments . That drains Mexico of capital needed for industrial expansion . Businessmen and wealthy citizens also seek safer havens outside Mexico for their cash. // ' ' Altogether , Mexico has exported over $107 billion in capital to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' Pastor says . That is continuing - at the rate of $12 billion to $15 billion a year , largely because of debt payments. // What can be done ? Some have suggested a Marshall Plan for Mexico , as the US helped Europe after World War II . But both Grayson and Pastor say that would be unwise. // What ' s really needed is help for Mexico on its debt , Pastor says . Reduced debt payments would stanch the drain of capital , and leave more money for new jobs. // Grayson says Mexico also needs labor-intensive ventures to improve its infrastructure - roads , ports , public utilities , irrigation systems . Such pick-and-shovel projects would quickly create jobs. // The outcome here is important for the US , Pastor says. // ' ' It ' s like your neighbor ' s house . If your neighbor takes good care of his house , the value of your house increases . If his house deteriorates , the value of your house declines. ' ' // The 1980s should have shown the US just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , ' ' we lost half our exports to Mexico in a single year . During the debt crisis , we ' ve lost the equivalent of $45 billion worth of trade with Mexico . Those are millions of US jobs lost.
