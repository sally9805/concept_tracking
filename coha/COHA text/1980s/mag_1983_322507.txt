CBS 's Rather takes the stand <P> The witness started out jaunty and self-confident but eventually appeared grim and embattled . Struggling to defend his competence and ethics , he looked as though he were facing a master interrogator - say , Dan Rather when he was on CBS 's 60 Minutes . Instead , Rather , now anchor of the CBS Evening News , was the co-defendant being grilled last week in a Los Angeles Superior Court chamber , in a $30 million suit for alleged defamation of a doctor at a clinic accused of insurance fraud . <P> The case stems from a Dec. 9 , 1979 , segment on 60 Minutes titled " It 's No Accident " about faked injuries from automobile mishaps . Rather 's narrative charged wide collusion among doctors and lawyers , but cited only one physician by name . A 60 Minutes investigator obtained a phony medical report at a clinic ; Rather held up the report and said , on air , " It was signed by Carl A. Galloway , M.D. " Among the estimated 40 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant relative of the clinic 's owner . Galloway informed CBS that he had left the clinic a month before the report was issued , and that his signature was forged - points that CBS does not contest - but he could not get a retraction . The network insists that Galloway knew of fraudulent activity . <P> Under sharp questioning from Gallo way 's attorney , Bruce Friedman , Rather was confronted with some factual errors and acknowledged a minimal effort to reach the doctor for comment . But much of the drama , and the potential consequence for TV journalism , resulted from an unprecedented judicial order compelling CBS to hand over all of its outtakes ( sound and picture footage that has been edited out ) . As the outtakes were shown to the jury and to TV audiences watching the trial live on Cable News Network , viewers got a unique chance to see how a story is put together and to second-guess CBS 's editorial judgment . They watched the Rather team coax witnesses , stage a confrontation and repeat questions until it got the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Rather testify that people who do not return phone calls are probably guilty . <P> Before the trial , Rather complained that the case , coming in tandem with a $120 million libel suit filed against CBS by General William Westmoreland , could have a chilling effect on investigative reporting . Said he : " In five years , maybe nobody will do this kind of story . "
