A growing protest against the soft treatment of drunk drivers <P> One day last summer , Tommy Sexton , 15 , of Bowie , Md. , and some neighbors were driving home after a day of fishing , when a car driven by David Watkins swerved into their lane and hit them . Sexton was killed . Watkins , who was drunk , suffered no injuries on the highway and a mere slap on the wrist in court . He received a two-year probationary sentence and had to pay $200 . <P> Such stories are frighteningly common . Someone is killed in a drunk-driving accident in the U.S. every 23 min. , an annual toll of more than 26,000 . Yet a drunk driver is rarely arrested , and the possibility of stiff punishment is remote . <P> At last , the American public 's patience seems to be running out . Outraged parents of young victims have formed groups that are badgering legislators , police , prosecutors and judges to crack down on drunk drivers . One of the leaders of the movement is Candy Lightner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , shortly after one of her three children was killed by a drunk driver while walking in a bicycle lane , Lightner quit her job as a real estate agent to found Mothers Against Drunk Drivers ( MADD ) . The organization now has 25 chapters in five states . Says she : " We 've kicked a few pebbles , we 'll turn a few stones , and eventually we 'll start an avalanche . " <P> Lobbying by MADD and similar organizations has already led several states to enact tougher laws , most of them dealing with sentencing . New York 's legislature passed a bill providing a minimum $350 fine for a first drunk-driving offense ( $250 even for those who bargain down to the lesser charge of " driving while ability is Impaired " ) . A major force behind the measure was Remove Intoxicated Drivers ( RID ) , a group formed in 1978 by Doris Aiken , 52 , with a $50 contribution from her church . Says she : " Last year each drunk driver in New York paid , on the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer out of season had to pay $1,500 . " <P> Many states are pulling more tipplers over to the side of the road . A new law in Michigan that allows police to detain drivers whom they suspect of drinking has increased arrests by 21% over the past year and a half . Previously , an officer either had to see an incident or find a witness to it . Maryland 's arrest rate is up 109% this year , in part because of a $150,000 federal grant that pays state troopers to work overtime , particularly on weekends , to nab boozed-up motorists . <P> A final pressure point is the courtroom , where judges and juries have rarely imposed stiff punishment on these largely middleclass , otherwise law-abiding defendants . RID has now set up a program in New York called Court-watch to study each judge 's treatment of drunk drivers . If the judges are not tough enough , they risk RID 's opposition on Election Day . Aiken claims that her group was primarily responsible for defeating a judge whose 75% conviction rate seemed too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
