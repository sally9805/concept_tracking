I STAND , conspicuously Caucasian , in the lobby of 2937 Eighth Avenue . The building belongs to the Polo Grounds Towers , a city housing project built more or less on the site where now-aging New Yorkers found a revelation in the young Willie Mays , and where , somewhat more recently , two young policemen found eternity lying in ambush be-hind a phony distress call . My wristwatch reads 8:08 . Seven minutes , it is , since I walked into the uncomfortable stares that always confront me uptown . I recall the first time I stood in one of the Polo Grounds buildings , some six years ago . I had asked the heavyset , middle-aged , package-laden black woman to my right why it took so long for any of the three ostensible elevators to return to base , whereupon she looked at me with amused contempt , and responded through a toothless smirk : " Hey , baby , this ai n't Sutton Place . Only one elevator workin ' these days ? and you damn lucky that one workin ' ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building door just a second ago . filling the lobby with lewdness and laughter , now note my presence and fall instantly silent in mid-expletive , en masse . They are studying me in an effort to determine exactly what level of the white establishment , and thus how much of a personal threat , I might represent .. Now and then , in the past , more ominous groups of teenagers have encircled me , measured me , taunted me , implying sinister intentions . Only once did my tormentors pursue it beyond the verbal stage . That , however , was in the East New York section of Brooklyn , where , contrary to popular belief , the average visitor has far more to fear than in all but the very worst parts of Harlem . ( I received a minor knife wound in the upper leg ; only through the skillful and decidedly unorthodox use of a two-foot carpenter 's level was I able to extricate myself intact from that predicament . ) The elevator finally arrives . I shuffle in , along with the crowd of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure , and sense that I am the subject of much conjecture : whites are routinely running about the projects during daylight , but rarely ride the elevators after dark . I am used to the attention , and even the occasional challenging comment leaves me unruffled . Once , from the rear of a full car , an authoritative but very young voice called out , " State your business , white man ! " Everybody broke up . I broke up . What 's the alternative ? As the elevator grudgingly heads skyward , a little black girl , her hair done in the finest , tiniest , most perfect braids , tentatively approaches me , much like a small puppy investigating uncharted territory . She eventually offers a child 's wonderfully ingenuous and carefree smile . The door opens at 16 , my floor . Someone has carefully altered the number on the wall opposite the elevator , so that it now reads 46 . Beside the violated number is a large , multicolored sketch of a man and woman having sexual intercourse , complete and anatomically correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misguided ghetto artists are quite fabulously endowed ( as are the lovers depicted in the sketch ) . They are also quite mobile , since their work , identified by their first names and street numbers , appears throughout the city on subway cars , buses , and mailboxes . Someday I hope to run into Eddie 138 , who is without question one of the more capable and versatile young freelance artists in Manhattan . I walk over to the window alongside the elevator bank , scanning the avenue below in search of my car . Twice I have come back to the street to find my tires flattened . Twice I have found my car covered with obscene or racist graffiti . Once I found nothing ? just an empty space and a quartet of giggling adolescents where my Audi had been . The car turned up three days later , underneath the approach to the Triborough Bridge , totally stripped . Tonight I am parked next to a Mr. Softee truck , near a streetlight , so I feel relatively un7 concerned . Still , it never hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny New York Times ad that I answered on a whim back in 1974 . The ad said simply , SHOP AT HOME SALES . UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITY . Since then , my unlimited opportunity has consisted mostly of wandering the streets of uptown New York singing the joys of the custom wall mirror to those who have availed themselves of our " no-obligation service . " This evening 's appointment is with a Mr. Watson , whose apartment looms ahead at the end of a long , dimly lit hallway . My knock at the door elicits a gruff " Jus ' a minute " from somewhere toward the rear of the apartment . I hear shuffling footsteps , followed by the now familiar sequence of front-door sounds : the tinny , rattling noise of the peephole cover being lifted , the jiggling of keys , the click of a tumbler , the whooshing sound of a dead bolt Segal lock . The door opens , and a tall , gray-haired man faces me . Tree-trunk arms protrude from a V-neck undershirt . Khaki slacks , desperately in need of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistline . The gruff impression dissolves as the large man breaks into a luminous grin . " You the mirro ' man ? C'm on in . Been waitin ' on you . " The hand I offer is promptly ingested by an enormous , exuberant Doberman that has materialized suddenly at the man 's side . My customer chuckles benignly . " Aw , he just a pup , you know ? He ai n't serious . He only playin ' wit ' you . " Then , with mock firmness , to the dog : " Satan ! C'm on now , boy . Quit playin ' wit ' the man 's arm . " Satan pardons my arm and begins playing with my calf . My host has already turned and begun walking toward the tiny kitchen , motioning for me to follow . Not wanting to appear something less than masculine , I shrug and hobble after him , dragging the dog along with me , while trying to recall the name of that place on York Avenue that sells prosthetic devices . The man offers me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate two plates , bowing slightly and extending his arm in the direction of the one good chair ( the other has obviously been used by Satan as a teething ring ) . His gesture exudes the gallant grace of one who , he later tells me , would like to have been the maitre d ' at a fashionable midtown restaurant , " a real ritzy place . But I could n't ; none of us could . Not back then . " I smile a thank you and sit . My furry friend resumes his work on my hand , whereupon the burly man grabs a folded newspaper that is perched atop the much scratched two-slice toaster . The dog bolts out of the room , emitting puppylike yelps . " Got to keep ' em in line , you know ? " the man explains , shaking his impromptu club pointedly in the air between us . " Else they begins to think they 's the boss . " " Now , what you got to show me ? " I open my sample case and dive into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I have to monitor myself at parties to prevent my lapsing into it whenever someone innocently asks what I do for a living . With razor-sharp psychology I go after his ego , implying that wall-to-wall mirrors will make him the envy of his friends , will give his bleak apartment the tailored look of a midtown duplex , will generally enable him to transcend being a poor , aging , overweight black man . He picks the style he would like ? or , more accurately , he picks what he thinks his " old lady " would like , since the mirror is being done as a surprise for her in honor of their fortieth ( fortieth ? ) wedding anniversary . The price I quote troubles him , but only momentarily , as that avuncular smile presently reappears and he asks , " You take Social Security checks for a down payment ? " The question arouses within me feelings of guilt and embarrassment . His kitchen wallpaper is tattered and peeling ; his cheap , checkered linoleum is faded and curled up at the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , which is missing much of its onetime porcelainized finish ; the small portable clothes dryer looks to be Sears , Roebuck 's original model , and there is a puddle of tepid water collecting under a correspondingly ancient washing machine from which come the sporadic sounds of impending mechanical death . Yet the man wants to endorse a Social Security check in order to put up $900 worth of wall mirrors . Sometimes I hate this job . A CONSENSUS of New York realtors might describe Harlem as the part of Manhattan that extends from 106th Street to 160th Street , and from river to river . To the midtown aristocracy , those able to afford the East Side in the Forties , Fifties , and Sixties , anything above 90th Street is to be sneered at . Needless to say , those who have recently forked over enormous sums of money to buy into renovated co-ops in the Nineties would beg to differ . Harlemites themselves generally adopt the least restrictive view , often extending Harlem 's informal northern border as far as the George Washington Bridge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled from Harlem up to the generally more stable bridge district quite naturally prefer to fix their former neighborhood 's uppermost limit considerably lower . Real-estate speculators , seeking to resuscitate the area around Columbia , are wont to exempt from inclusion that stretch between Broadway and Riverside Drive that runs adjacent to the university . And suburbanites , inundated nightly with the body count on the news , probably equate most of the city with its infamous upper half . Suburbanites and midtowners also have an unrealistically bleak picture of the uptown housing situation . Harlem is hardly one huge , crurn-Ming tenement . Those for whom the ? term " housing development " evokes visions of a bombed-out slum , complete with rats rummaging through garbage-strewn halls , would be astonished at the number of comfortable , if not opulent , building complexes that dot Harlem 's landscape . Two such complexes ? Esplanade ; Plaza and Lenox Terrace Apart-1 ments ? rise impressively out of Harlem'snorthern end . An appointment al this day will take me to 720 Lenox , in " the Esplanade , " probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime political force , radio-station magnate , and resident of " the Terrace , " might argue the point ; after all , the Terrace has doormen in its doorways ? Esplanade Plaza employs uniformed security guards ) . Though mainly populated by city employees and nurses from Harlem 's nearby hospitals , it is the elegant retired ladies , wearing fox stoles to walk their dainty French poodles , who provide these developments with their genteel flavor and form , perhaps , the last remaining link to Harlem 's glamorous prewar past . They are , like their stoles , anachronisms , belonging in a different time ; a time , twenty or thirty years before the Esplanade 's debut , when the poodle could have been walked anywhere along 145th Street , or well down Lenox Avenue , without fear . Now , most of the nighttime dog walkers venture no farther than the bus depot that occupies the length of 147th Street and half a block between Lenox and Seventh avenues . And yet the decay of the surrounding area notwithstanding , an apartment in Esplanade Plaza is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harlemites aspire . Cheerful ceramic tiles are found in a variety of colors and patterns in the lobbies of the six Esplanade buildings , in marked contrast to the sparse , institutional look of the Polo Grounds and other city housing projects . I step into an elevator and am carried promptly to the eighth floor . Though I am not alone in the car , there is neither snickering nor staring going on around me . In the Esplanade , as in the Terrace , my presence is routine and accepted , for many of the tenants maintain after-hours interracial friendships . A very proper , dignified " Who 's there , please ? " greets my arrival at apartment 8B . By the tenor of the male voice , I know what to expect . The man on the other side of the door is proud of his assimilation into mainstream society . His preferred libation ? which I will , of course , be politely offered ? is white wine , rather than a bottle of Bud , and he favors Calvin Klein ensembles over khaki pants or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes or soft Brazilian jazz , never anything as unabashedly provocative as hard rock or heavy soul . Copies of Newsweek and Esquire will adorn his wicker coffee table . ( Ebony and Jet can be found tucked neatly in his natural cedar bookshelf , but are not prominently displayed . ) If he is married , his children will have traditional names like Michael or Eric , Jennifer or Elizabeth , as opposed to the African derivatives ( such as Karim or Naima ) currently popular among blacks lower on the socioeconomic ladder . The door swings open to reveal an extremely good-looking , fortyish black man wearing a Jordache crew-neck sweater through which the collar of a silk shirt protrudes . He enthusiastically shakes my hand , beaming a grin of toothpaste-commercial quality . I smile , too ? partly in response to his contagious good humor , and partly out of my own sense of self-satisfied vindication . Knowing this man as well as he knows himself ( or possibly better , I think ) , I walk in and go to work , noting the empty bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . T HE HEAVY metal door swings open and into luscious focus comes a young creature of black and Hispanic heritage , clad only in a diaphanous nightgown and a wispy pair of bikini underpants . She is eighteen , maybe twenty at most , and quite phenomenally assembled , with modified negroid features peeking out seductively from under the layers of her long , wavy black hair . In earlier days , more naive and reckless days , I used to consider every such greeting an invitation , but too many rebuffs have made me a bit more circumspect . Nor was it unusual for the young woman 's appearance to be followed in short order by that of a young male , similarly " dressed . " Thus I have learned to accept such events as merely a part of summertime life in the projects . There is no air conditioning in 25 these buildings ; my nubile nymph simply happens to be comfortable walking around in minimal clothing . Just as we sit clown , the muted cries of an infant summon the lovely young girl back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plump baby boy , and I suddenly realize that she is the head of the house . The baby 's corpulence is oddly incongruous with the petite woman-child who now proudly holds him forward for me to inspect . " This is Hector , " she announces . " Do you like the name Hector ? " " Yes , " I lie , For years I have wondered why so many Puerto Rican parents saddle their young with names like Felix and Hector . Out of the blue , she asks where I live . My reply , that I have a house on Long Island , fascinates her . " Long Island ! I was there once , " she says with a twinkle in her eye and an animation in her voice that would seem more appropriate if she were six years old and we were talking about Disneyland . " Someday , we are going to move away from here , to someplace like Long Island , so my son can grow upstrong and healthy without getting into the stuff that goes on around here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me feel as if I am privy to something august and unusual , something quite beyond the emotional scope of the pampered Manhasset housewife who parks the kids at Grandma 's as a prelude to a leisurely and exorbitant afternoon at Lord &; Taylor 's . The carnal chemistry I felt on first seeing the delicious shape at the door has now yielded to a respectful fondness for the madonna who sits before me , playfully nibbling her little boy s ear . I smile with the realization that there is still so much for me to learn about myself here , of all places . As I stand in the elevator , still thinking of the young mother and her Hector , a wiry Mack forearm is suddenly thrust into the diminishing space between the doorframe and the closing elevator door . The pitted black rubber molding on the door 's leading edge reaches the arm . pauses momentarily , then recedes . Through the opening and into the corner of the elevator car , opposite me , slithers a very tall , very thin adolescentwearing tennis sneakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is brilliantly sunny outdoors ) , and one of those Pittsburgh Pirate baseball caps that became so fashionable the year the Bucs won the World Series . He is , I am quite sure , appraising me . The door closes , the car begins its leisurely descent . " Got a cigarette , man ? " His tone is even and controlled , rugged but not menacing . Nothing to worry about . I am relieved as 1 tell him that / do n't smoke . " Got any money , man ? " Something to worry about . I look straight at him ; he returns my stare . He is slouched back against the wall of the elevator , hands in his pockets , mouth just on the verge of a sneer , eyebrows raised inquisitively above drooping eyelids . The elevator is still some fifteen floors above sea level , and moving slowly . I decide to try bravado . After all , the kid is no more than seventeen or eighteen years old , and although he stands about my height , I have a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way through . " You better cool it , sonny , " I 1 UNCHTIME finds me in the Kansas Fried Chicken takeout store on Lenox Avenue . J Just about two years ago , right where I am standing as I give my order , the danger of running an uptown business and a hard-working black man 's life were summed up in a chalk outline on the floor . As the newspapers told it , two shotgun-wielding thieves were unhappy with the take , and in a merciless act that has become an almost commonplace punctuation to robberies in Harlem , one of the disgruntled bandits fired his awesome weapon point-blank into the owner 's face . For weeks after the shooting . residents in this bleakest of Harlem 's many bleak neighborhoods ? neighborhoods in which tenement dwellers are forced to cope with incomprehensible violence on a daily basis ? even the more stoic , senior residents remained shaken and sad . Clutching the steering wheel in one hand and a chicken leg in the other , I make the right turn onto St. Nicholas Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a collapsed derelict is being loaded into an Emergency Medical Service ambulance . The attendants jump in and the vehicle speeds oil , going right past the prominent sign for Sydenham Hospital on its way to some unknown facility . It occurs to me that the uninformed might well have found the scenecomical , especially in light of the EMS 's unenviable reputation for fallibility . ( Hey , fellas , come back ! The hospital 's over here . ) Yet I know that to the local inhabitants who less funny . I watch the flashing lights turn abruptly into the noisy congestion of 125th Street . Speaking of which : perhaps nowhere is the disparity between Harlem fact and Harlem fiction more distinct than in the average nonHarlemite 's concept of 125th Street . Most of my friends , even those who live somewhere in the city and should thus know better , use the term " 125th Street " pejoratively , as a symbol of decadent hopelessness . An acquaintance once said , on returning from his first ear-shattering day at a Long Island pistol range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In reality , the street , at least for most of its length , is a bustling , reasonably well-maintained center of local commerce . Stores of all descriptions separate a variety of restaurants , banks , and modest-sized office buildings . And while it may be true that the city projects that claim 125th Street 's south side , from Eighth Avenue west to Broadway , house some of New York 's poorer residents , it is equally true that I have never had a truly frightful experience in my half-dozen years working that much maligned stretch . Actually , given the conditions under which these people live ? elevators that fail to elevate , maintenance men who fail to maintain , police who fail to police , a percentage of incorrigible neighbors who fail to observe some of the fundamental rules of sanitary living ? the jovial passivity with which the majority of them face the day is astounding . Possibly , religion has much to do with it ; in many project apartments the Bible , open to a favorite page , sits on the dining-room table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oft-used reading matter . This in contrast to midtown , where the expensively bound ( but always closed ) Bibles are relegated to a permanent position somewhere on a teak bookshelf . Clearly , the rewards of an afterlife are more stirring to those who have so few rewards in this one . HE END OF another day . I turn the key , and the trusted engine beneath the hood of my 1973 Cougar roars to life . I stop for the light at the corner of 116th Street and Fifth Avenue . where a ragged-looking group of street people are talking street talk . The sign over their heads , haphazardly hand-painted directly on the concrete wall in red block letters , says AUTO PARTS , but there is no corresponding business below . I search among the group and think I see , in the faint glow from the streetlight , a familiar pair of eyes . They find me as well and brighten noticeably , imparting an almost childlike appearance to the craggy , bestubbled senior citizen 's face to which they belong . The slight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his memorable , bouncy but arthritic strut . " Ehhh , Fontana , how you doin ' ? " He calls me Fontana ; 1 have no idea why . He has always called me that , since the lovely spring day three years ago when my car clock went awry and I pulled over to ask if he would happen to know what time it was . We trade small talk , and I begin to drift into modified jive talk . I want to kick myself , but he does n't seem offended by my subconscious patronizing . I tell him I do n't think it matters who won the election , nobody 's gon na deliver what they promised anyway . " You got that right , you got that right , " he agrees , nodding . The light changes . He taps me on the elbow , and tells me it was nice to see me again . I say the same ; I feel the same . He appears , from what little I know of him , to be a genuinely warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his name , and I feel guilty for the oversight . I often think that when he dies , I would like to go to the funeral , send a few dollars to his lady ? do something . I know I won't.
