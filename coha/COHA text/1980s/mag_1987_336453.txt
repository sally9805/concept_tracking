For food growers , the past two decades must have seemed like some nightmarish Nutrition Court . One after another , popular foods from butter to beef have been hauled into the dock and charged with crimes against health and humanity . " Guilty , " the jury of popular and scientific opinion has snapped each time . The punishment : a sentence to suffer lower sales and market shares . Bang of gavel . But these days , food manufacturers have wised up . They are now mounting aggressive advertising campaigns to press claims that their products have got a bum rap and to extoll the benefits of the genuine article . Enter the rehabilitation of real food . <P> Meat and dairy groups , which have suffered the most from consumers ' withdrawal pangs , are making the biggest efforts to regain public trust . In January the National Live Stock and Meat Board launched a $30 million promotion campaign that it hopes will beef up sales that have been less than bullish since 1976 . Back then , Americans ' per capita consumption was 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <P> The " Real Food For Real People " ads feature such wholesome types as Actress Cybill Shepherd and Actor James Garner , who was named the " last real man " in 1985 by PEOPLE magazine . Along with the glitz and macho , though , the industry emphasizes that cattle are now bred leaner and cuts of beef are trimmed of excess fat . Today , consumers are told , a 3-oz. serving of beef contains the same level of cholesterol as an equivalent amount of chicken . <P> The National Pork Producers Council is trying to boost consumer interest with former Olympic Figure Skating Champ Peggy Fleming and a $7 million pitch presenting pork as the " other white meat , " comparing it favorably with poultry . The National Dairy Board meanwhile is plugging milk , yogurt and cheese for their high content of a vaunted mineral . " Calcium the way nature intended , " blare the ads . All-dairy products get to sport a red REAL seal . <P> Almost every industry group is touting nutrition . The Washington Apple Commission , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " original health food " and asserts that the natural fiber in apples is an appetite suppressor . The Potato Board is pushing its vegetable as " multivitamins with minerals . " Even the Sugar Association has something positive to stress : the sweetener 's low 16 calories a teaspoon and its placement on the Food and Drug Administration 's " safe " list , a claim artificial alternatives can not make . " Which would you rather put on your kids ' cereal ? " the ads ask . <P> To be sure , the unsavory reputations of certain foods are undeserved . " Potatoes have complex carbohydrates , fiber and are a good source of vitamin C , " says Dr. Walter Mertz , director of the U.S.D.A. 's Human Nutrition Research Center in Beltsville , Md . " As a basic food , they 're excellent . " Some food scientists point out that there is no such thing as a " bad " food . " Every food , even sugar , meat or eggs , has its place as part of a balanced and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess , " Mertz observes .
