For 25 years the face of Shotoku , the prince of sagely virtue who drafted Japan 's first constitution more than a dozen centuries ago , has calmly but sternly graced Japanese bank notes . But the prince is being deposed . On Nov. 1 , he will be replaced on 10,000 yen notes ( about $40 ) by a more modern figure , Yukichi Fukuzawa , an important figure in the Westernization of Japan in the 19th century . On 5,000 yen bills , where Shotoku had also ruled , goes Inazo Nitobe , an official in the old League of Nations . The new face on a 1 , 000 yen note is that of a newspaperman and novelist , Soseki Natsume , who died in 1916 . <P> The current bank notes were around for so long they had become an easy target for counterfeiters . The new ones will be tougher to fake . They each have a spray of colors , 15 for the 10,000 yen note alone , and larger watermarks . For the blind , they will bear their value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vending machines , where the Japanese buy everything from railroad tickets to whisky , will have to be converted to accept the new currency .
