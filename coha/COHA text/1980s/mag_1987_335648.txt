In conceiving this special issue on the Constitution , TIME 's editors set out to portray the charter not as a dry historical relic but as a vital part of American life . Says Senior Editor Jose M. Ferrer III , who oversaw the project : " We thought , ' If it is a living document , as is often said , why is that so ? What is the news of it ? ' We took off from there . We wanted to show that the Constitution is all around us in ways we almost take for granted . " <P> The foldout cover painting , created by Illustrator Richard Hess , captures that spirit by gathering a panorama of disparate figures from every period of U.S. history  --  Native American and police officer , physician and flower child , colonial mother and suffragist  --  all united by the principles of the Constitution . <P> For Tom Bentkowski , TIME 's art director for special projects , this issue 's challenge was to convey the pervasiveness of the charter 's influence visually . He and Ferrer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than in TIME 's usual sections . Says Bentkowski : " The whole process was engrossing . It became richer as we went along . " A case in point is the photographic essay that accompanies the story by TIME Senior Writer Lance Morrow about the ubiquitous effects of the Constitution on U.S. citizens . Most of the pictures were planned in advance with Dorothy Affa , who directed photo research for the issue . Says Bentkowski : " Our aim here was not to document everyday life but to convey a symbolic idea through real objects and real people . It is rare to get a chance to think in advance about the elements of a photograph . " <P> In an office lined with scores of art books and bedecked with posters of the Beatles and Mozart , Bentkowski works on his designs . Often he plays a wide range of music on his record-and-tape system , a reminder of the days when he wrote a column of rock criticism for New York magazine , from 1977 to 1984 . There have been other aspirations . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Bentkowski , who hails from Buffalo , " but I was a rare combination of lack of size and lack of speed . " The world of magazine design was the obvious beneficiary . After graduating from Pratt Institute , he worked on a host of publications , among them Saturday Review , L'Express , the New York Times and the Atlantic . <P> Since 1980 Bentkowski has designed four TIME special issues . These were in- depth reports on the Soviet Union ( 1980 ) ; Japan ( 1983 ) ; the latest wave of immigrants to the U.S. ( 1985 ) ; and American Best ( 1986 ) , a journalistic celebration of everything that America and Americans do well . His eye-catching page design has also sharpened the look of TIME 's annual Man of the Year and Images issues . Not surprisingly , many of Bentkowski 's visual ideas have made their way from the special issues into our regular weekly pages . " Within the confines of TIME 's weekly responsibilities , " he says , " we 've tried to treat every issue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each edition of TIME an informative blend of visual and editorial elements . " We 've gone far beyond treating pictures as footnotes to the text , " he explains . " They now play an essential role in transmitting information . "
