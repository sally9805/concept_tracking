1 . EXT . COUNTRYSIDE , MASSACHUSETTS DAY A classic New England scene . Green fields stretch away down a hill toward a cluster of red-painted farm buildings . A picture postcard accompanied by the sounds of droning bees and the occasional bird call . Alien sounds , faint at first , drift toward us -- laughter , a snatch of song , the chatter of foreign voices . The camera eases imperceptibly back to frame the view in the window of a stationary pickup truck . &nbsp; ALLIE ( O.S. ) Here come the savages . The " savages " appear from the direction of the farm buildings , tracking slowly across the fields , their silhouettes shimmering in the May heat . They are Honduran migrant workers , dressed in shabby clothes , some with rags on their heads , others wearing broad-brimmed hats . There are both men and boys in the group , all of them carrying long knives . They form a striking contrast with this most Yankee of landscapes . A match is struck in the cab of the truck and clouds of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.S. ) Why do they bother to come here ? More cigar smoke . &nbsp; ALLIE ( O.S. ) Money you tell me ? The first face we see in the truck belongs to CHARLIE FOX , 13 -- he glances up at his father . Charlie 's face is pleasant , innocent , intelligent -- we 'll see the story through his eyes . His father continues : &nbsp; ALLIE ( O.S. ) But how could it be money ? Cut to ALLIE FOX , a strongly built man in his mid-forties . He stares out the window , contemplatively chewing on his thin cheroot.  --  3  --  Suddenly , he 's all action , as if what he 's just seen has both excited and infuriated him . He starts the truck , guns the engine and releases the brake , as a torrent of words pour from his mouth . &nbsp; ALLIE ( O.S. ) It sure as heck is n't money . These days a dollar 's only worth twenty cents . CUT TO : 2 . INT .

I 'd have traded places with them . They think this is paradise . Should never have come . Know what they 've got down there in the jungle ? Geothermal energy . All the juice they need five-thousand feet underground . It 's the earth 's bellybutton . Close on Charlie as he sneaks a glance at his father ; he loves these tirades . &nbsp; ALLIE ( continuing ) No T.V. where they come from . No Nipponese Video crapola , and look at the ecosystem in the tropics . Has n't changed since the world began . Why do they think we have the answers ? Allie gives Charlie a playful jab in the ribs . Charlie beams ; he has the most unique , the most courageous , the best father .  --  4  --  &nbsp; ALLIE ( continuing ) They do n't know what to do with what they 've got . . . Geothermal energy .

The words stream from Allie as he builds to his finale . &nbsp; ALLIE ( continuing ) Give me the wretched refuse of your teeming shores , have a Coke , watch T.V. , go on welfare , get free money , turn to crime . Crime pays in this country . Mug somebody , become a pillar of the community , why does anyone put up with it ? The rave is over and there is a sudden , overwhelming silence . We become aware of the rattles and squeaks of the vehicle . Allie glances at Charlie . &nbsp; ALLIEI 'm just thinking out loud . END CREDIT SEQUENCE CUT TO : 3 . EXT . NORTHAMPTON , STREET DAY The pickup swings into Main Street . CUT TO : 4 . INT . TRUCK DAY &nbsp; ALLIEI do n't know . Look around , Charlie . This place 's a toilet . Northampton , a small American town . A little too artsy , a little too cute maybe -- but certainly no toilet . Teenagers share the sidewalk with locals and weekending New Yorkers . Their truck approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ALLIE ( continuing ) It 's not the college girls , though they 're bad enough . ( motions to Charlie ) Look at Tugboat Annie over there . The size of her . She 's so big it would only take eleven of her to make a dozen . But that 's fat -- that 's not health . That 's cheeseburgers . He sticks his head out the window and hollers : &nbsp; ALLIEThat 's cheeseburgers . The girls turn open-mouthed ; then return to their gossip . Allie wears a faded Sears work shirt and sweat-stained baseball cap . The flaps of his pockets and collar are frayed white with wear . Charlie wears a loose short sleeve shirt . Allie slows the truck as they near the supermarket . He points out an ice vending machine . &nbsp; ALLIEThey sell ice -- ten pounds for half a buck . But water 's as free as air . Those dingbats are selling water ! It 's big news -- water 's good for you ! Low-cal beer -- know what 's in it ? Know why it keeps you thin ? Know why it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allie repeats in the Yankee fashion as he parks the truck . CUT TO : 5 . EXT . STREET , NORTHAMPTON DAY Charlie jumps out of the cab and steps alongside his father ; they head for the supermarket . Allie wears old " refitted " army pants . Buttoned and zippered pockets have been patch-quilted onto the olive fatigues ; his lower half resembles a walking junk drawer . It would take half an hour to search him . They pass a policeman as they go . The policeman eyes Charlie intently , then follows .  --  6  --  &nbsp; POLICEMANShould n't he be in school ? &nbsp; ALLIE ( w/o breaking stride ) Sick . The officer overtakes them , blocking their path . &nbsp; POLICEMANHold on . Why is n't he in bed , then ? &nbsp; ALLIEWith a fungal infection ? Go on , Charlie , show him . He does n't believe me . Take off your shoes . Give him a whiff . Charlie dutifully bends over to untie his shoelaces . The policeman thinks better of it . &nbsp; POLICEMANForget it . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of weakness . &nbsp; POLICEMAN ( hard ) What did you say ? &nbsp; ALLIE ( still smiling ) Just thinking out loud .

But what kind of sense does it make when cops go ' round looking for fungal infections while murderers and rapists roam the streets . I tell you Charlie , no one thinks of leaving this country -- I think of it every day . I 'm the last man ! CUT TO : Section Details 6 . INT . HARDWARE STORE DAY The electronic doors crash open as Allie and Charlie enter the neon-lit store . Allie strides down an aisle , Charlie almost jogging to keep up with him . They approach a counter . A clerk looks up . He sighs as Allie approaches ; he has dealt with Mr. Fox before . &nbsp; ALLIEI want a rubber seal , eight feet of it , with foam backing . The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not one for small talk . Allie turns to Charlie , continuing an earlier train of thought . &nbsp; ALLIEYou know why gas is so expensive ? They put water in it - you do n't believe me ? . . . Allie 's voice fades and we hear Charlie 's narration . He speaks with the voice of a mature man , remembering these events . Sometimes he speaks with the reflected wisdom which time has brought ; at other times he speaks as if he were still thirteen , remembering what he felt at that moment . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) Father had dropped out of Harvard , to get an education , he said . He was an inventor , a genius with anything mechanical . Nine patents , six pending . I grew up with the belief that the world belonged to him and everything he said was true .  --  8  --  The hardware clerk returns with a coil of rubber , interrupting both Allie 's diatribe and Charlie 's narration . Allie examines the coil , spots the stamp indicating its country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it . &nbsp; CLERKThat 's what you asked for . Allie shoots him a pitying look . &nbsp; ALLIE ( smiling ) Who are you working for , the Japanese ? &nbsp; CLERKIf you do n't want it , just say so . &nbsp; ALLIEI just said so , Jack . It 's made in Japan . I do n't want my hard-earned dollars converted into yen . I want an AMERICAN length of rubber seal , with foam backing . The clerk has heard all this before , and spotting another customer , he scuttles away . &nbsp; ALLIEDo You Work Here ? The clerk glances back , then introduces himself to a customer . Allie leads Charlie out of the store . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 'll find it someplace else . ( looks back ) Maybe I should have said Sayonara ! CUT TO : 7 . EXT . SCRAPYARD DAY Charlie and Allie wander through the organized chaos of a junkyard . Everything from piles of battered furniture and household goods to stacks of old tires . Allie whips out a screwdriver from one of his many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fridge . " He 's looking for a " rubber seal with foam backing . "  --  9  --  &nbsp; ALLIEI 'll tell you , Charlie . I 'm not going into Northampton again . I 'm sick of meeting people who want things I 've already rejected . Things they 've seen on T.V. -- where they talk about nuclear war as if it were some game show question --  here , give me a hand with this . Allie disentangles the rubber coil from the back of the fridge and passes it to Charlie . CUT TO : 8 . INT . ALLIE 'S WORKSHOP DAY Allie works on a curious wooden box filled with a tangle of copper pipes . Charlie watches as his father fits the recently acquired rubber seal into the inner workings of the machine . Allie 's workshop reflects the outward disorder of his ordered mind . Maps and schematic diagrams are tacked to the shelves ; tools and coils of wire hang from every available space . Allie 's inventions , some complete , some discarded , some in progress , stand between tool benches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cardboard , are tacked to shelves and cupboard doors . Charlie 's brother , JERRY , age eleven , enters the workshop and wanders over to join Charlie . &nbsp; ALLIEIt 's like a human 's insides . ( Jerry and Charlie peer into the box ) See ? Entrails and Vitals . ( He points with a screwdriver ) Brisket . Digestive tract . Respiration . Circulatory system . Fatty tissue . &nbsp; JERRYWhat is it , Dad ? Allie closes the lid , turns smiling to his sons . &nbsp; ALLIEIt 's perfection , that 's what it is . Just wait 'll old Roly sees it . CUT TO :  --  10  --  9 . EXT . WORKSHOP/FOX HOUSE DAY Allie and the boys struggle out of the workshop carrying the wooden box . They place it on the back of the pickup parked in the driveway . The Foxes live in a large , somewhat idiosyncratic farmhouse set back from the narrow road . Signs of self-sufficiency abound ; a well-tended vegetable patch , a solar heating system , and an elaborate composting machine . Twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front porch . Allie ruffles Clover 's hair as he makes his way inside . CUT TO : 10 . EXT. /INT . KITCHEN WINDOW , FOX HOUSE DAY As Charlie locks up the tailgate of the truck , he glances up to the open kitchen window to see his father and mother talking . His mother is an attractive , intelligent country girl in her early thirties . She 's referred to by all in the family , including Allie , as " Mother . " Charlie 's point of view is diffused by the fly-screen mesh on the window , and it 's rather like looking at an old faded photograph . &nbsp; MOTHERPolski was looking for you . &nbsp; ALLIEDo n't worry about Roly . &nbsp; MOTHERHe was pretty mad , said you 'd promised to fix the hopper . &nbsp; ALLIEForget that . I got something better for him out there . &nbsp; MOTHERAllie , you promised . . . &nbsp; ALLIEMother , I 'm gon na knock his boots off , I 'm gon na straighten his hair . . .  --  11  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fades into narration . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) Mother was always perfectly calm . Father lectured us , but she never made speeches . When he was around , she gave him her full attention , but when he was away , she was ours . Father did n't approve of school , so he kept us at home , and Mother became our teacher . Through the window we see Allie playfully embrace his wife . Her laughter drifts outside . Close on Charlie . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) Together , they seemed like a wild man and an angel . CUT TO : 11 . INT . ALLIE 'S PICKUP/ROAD THROUGH A FIELD DAY Allie follows a battered old truck through a narrow corridor of asparagus growing on either side of the road . The truck stops to unload its cargo of migrant workers . They take little notice of Allie and his boys , in the cab of their pickup , as they file off toward their primitive quarters , after a hard day in the fields . Allie studies them , puffing on his cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he saw them . &nbsp; ALLIEImagine the problems they have in the jungle without refrigeration . If they saw an ice-cube they 'd probably think it was a diamond or some kind of jewel . ( He turns to the boys ) Ice is civilization .  --  12  --  &nbsp; CHARLIEMaybe they do n't have electricity ? Jerry glares at his brother , then turns away . He 's envious of the special relationship between his older brother and his father . &nbsp; ALLIEYou do n't need electricity for refrigeration -- just suction . You can get ice out of fire ( he smiles ) , you 'll see . Allie draws on his cigar , stares at the men . &nbsp; ALLIE ( continuing ) Savages. He says the word with affection . They watch as one of the men waves his long asparagus knife in the air . &nbsp; JERRYAre they dangerous ? &nbsp; ALLIENot as dangerous as your average American . And only when they get mad . You know they 're mad when they 're smiling . Allie smiles at the boys . The truck ahead moves off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn into animals , killers . Animals sort of smile just before they bite you . &nbsp; JERRYDo those men bite ?  --  13  --  &nbsp; ALLIEKnow how they do it , Jerry ? Kill you ? I 'll tell you . ( he lowers his voice ) They hollow you out . That 's why it would take courage to go to their country -- and not ordinary gumption , but **27;2005;TOOLONG courage . Who 's got that ? The boys look uneasy and Allie smiles to himself at this . &nbsp; ALLIEAdmit it boys , this is better than school . CUT TO : Section Details 12 . EXT . POLSKI 'S FARM DAY The Fox pickup pulls onto a semicircular gravel drive in front of the Colonial style " mansion . " Beyond the main house stretches an asparagus farm , replete with modern farm machinery , a shiny jeep and several warehouses . Allie 's wood contraption slides on the flatbed as he brakes . TINY POLSKI -- having spotted Allie coming -- steps out of his house . Polski , 50 , short and plump , sports an L.L. Bean shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's always dressed for work but never gets dirty . Allie hops out of the cab ; Charlie and Jerry follow . &nbsp; POLSKII was looking for you all over . You fix my hopper ? ( He notices the box ) What 's this ? Allie smiles at him . &nbsp; ALLIEGot a match , doc ? &nbsp; POLSKIYou come all the way over here to ask for a match , Allie ?  --  14  --  &nbsp; ALLIEYep . And a glass of water , if it is n't too much bother . Regular faucet water . Muttering " vegular water , " Polski goes inside . Mrs. Polski appears at a window and looks out . Allie turns to the boys . &nbsp; ALLIEHe 's going to love this . A moment later Polski returns with a box of kitchen matches and a glass of water . Allie thanks him for the water , sniffs it , then walks around his box-like invention . Polski speaks with an ingrained Eastern European accent . &nbsp; POLSKIPretty small for a coffin . &nbsp; ALLIEAi n't a coffin . ( opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ALLIEThat 's right .

He adjusts the pipes and fittings which protrude from the box , then lights a kerosene burner underneath . &nbsp; POLSKIDo n't tell me you 're going to cook a glass of water ? Allie 's having a grand old time . Charlie looks nervously from Polski to his father .  --  15  --  &nbsp; ALLIEYou wo n't be disappointed , doc . How 's the asparagus ? &nbsp; POLSKIToo much of it . It 's the heat . I got more than I can store . What 's this anyway ? Allie 's contraption coughs smoke . &nbsp; ALLIECharlie , what is it ? &nbsp; CHARLIEIt looks like a fat baby . A fat baby boy . &nbsp; ALLIEFat Boy. Good . That 's what we 'll call it . Charlie beams -- he 's named father 's invention . Polski turns to Charlie . &nbsp; POLSKIVat is it ? Ask your father . He never gives me a straight answer . Allie flourishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows a slow ring of smoke as if he has all the time in the world . &nbsp; POLSKII 've got work to do , Mr. Fox . Mind opening up that box ? The water must be cooked by now . Allie thinks , then turns to Charlie . &nbsp; ALLIELet 's take a look . Allie , now the roadshow magician , pushes up his sleeve and reaches into " Fat Boy . " He withdraws the glass with much ado and hands it to Polski , who bobbles it , shifting it from one hand to the other .  --  16  --  &nbsp; POLSKIA hot potato -- I mean , a cold one ! The glass is frosted over . &nbsp; ALLIEGo on . Pour it . Polski turns the glass upside down and shakes it . It 's frozen solid . Allie says triumphantly : &nbsp; ALLIEIce . &nbsp; POLSKIAi n't that sumthin . &nbsp; ALLIEBut where 's the juice ? Where 's the electric cord ? &nbsp; POLSKIKerosene . &nbsp; ALLIE ( winks at Charlie ) You mean I made ice out of fire ? &nbsp; POLSKISo it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; POLSKISome other time . &nbsp; ALLIEStick your hand in there .

What do you think ? &nbsp; POLSKIIt 's ingenious , Mr. Fox . I always said you were ingenious . That 's why I hired you . Now I have work to do . It 's a fine invention , but I got no use for it .  --  17  --  They watch as Polski turns and walks toward his asparagus . Allie struggles with conflicting emotions . He wants to walk away , but he ca n't . He grabs the specimen of ice and hurries after Polski . Charlie watches , dumbfounded . He 's never seen his father chase anyone after being snubbed . Allie thrusts the melting ice at Polski . &nbsp; ALLIEYou 're out of touch with reality , doc ! I 'm asking you to consider the possibilities of the thing ! No noise , no juice -- you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLSKIElectricity 's cheap . &nbsp; ALLIEWhat about ten years from now ? Or twenty ? What then ?

I 'm in the asparagus business , not the inventing business . I pay you plenty to keep this farm running and right now we 're harvesting more asparagus than I can store ! &nbsp; ALLIEIs that your problem Doc ? Well , I could preserve the excess ! &nbsp; POLSKIYeah ? How ? &nbsp; ALLIEFat Boy , that 's how .  --  18  --  &nbsp; POLSKIThat thing there ? It 's too small . &nbsp; ALLIEWake-up , Doc .

The children ( Jerry , April and Clover , among them ) are arranged at tables squeezed into the corners . CAPTAIN SMALLS sits at one end of the table , Allie at the other . Smalls , a bourgeois old salt , wears his uniform without enthusiasm . Behind his head a faded sign reads " Capt . Ambrose Smalls . " Between them , across from Mother , sits REV .

He turns to April and Clover . &nbsp; ALLIEOkay , girls , you promised you would sing us a song on our first Thanksgiving .  --  52  --  &nbsp; CLOVERDad . . . &nbsp; ALLIEA promise is a promise . &nbsp; MOTHERGo on , girls . Clover and April stand and sing a new song a capella : " Under the Bam , Under the Boo . " It has been a good summer . The Maywits , even the Zambus , seem calmer , happier -- more " civilized . " The principle facilities have been built ; the crops harvested . Jeronimo is a greater success than anyone but Allie would have imagined . Seen from above , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wide brown river : a well-ordered community carved out of jungle . Beyond the compound , nothing but miles of swamp , formless rivulets and guanacaste trees . A distant mountain range breaks the monotony of the horizon . CUT TO : Section Details 50 . EXT . JERONIMO DAYBREAK A low-lying mist hangs over the encampment . The main buildings emerge from the dimness as the first rays of the sun strike the compound . A new and strange looking building , off to one side , is still mostly shrouded in the gloom . CUT TO : 51 . EXT . JUNGLE DAYBREAK Several primitive natives , some carrying bows and arrows , stare in the direction of the camp . Suddenly they react with a mixture of fear and awe . There is much sucking in of breath and muttering in their language . CUT TO :  --  53  --  52 . EXT . JERONIMO , NATIVES ( P.O.V. ) DAYBREAK The mists surrounding the new building are clearing to reveal a remarkable sight . A vast wooden monolith , several stories high , rises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatchway door -- a box , a gigantic box with a tin lid . From inside come vague rumbles and echoes mingling with the sound of a man singing -- yet distorted , unearthly . CUT TO : 53 . EXT . JUNGLE DAY The natives , on hearing the noises from the monolith , become alarmed and back off until lost in the jungle wall . CUT TO : 54 . EXT . THE MONOLITH MORNING The Zambus , Maywits and children gather around the structure . It looks oddly like the box Allie and Charlie took to Polski's -- although twenty-five times larger . From inside we hear Allie singing away as he works . Allie comes outside , outfitted in a welding mask and gloves . He stops singing to speak . Sparks surround his words : &nbsp; ALLIEA pair of lungs , that 's what he needs . No one ever invented anything . Anyone who invents is only magnifying . All the inventions are based on the human body . The ball-and-socket joint is the hip ; airplanes are just magnified sparrows with leg room . The Zambus hang on every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask ) A Savage is someone who does n't bother to look around and see that he can change the world . That 's what 's wrong with your missionaries . They teach you to put up with things , not change them . His audience murmurs assent . Mother approaches them .  --  54  --  &nbsp; ALLIEI 'm not saying all inventions are good . Take cheese spread that you squirt out of an aerosol can onto your sandwich . That 's as low as you can go . But I never made anything that did n't exist in a similar form before -- rubber heart valves , metal muscles . &nbsp; HADDYSo , so , Fadder . I sometime think arm crane . &nbsp; ALLIENow you 're catching on . ( points to the Monolith ) And what 's this ? &nbsp; HADDYThat 's ' spearmint . You never catch me in there . &nbsp; ALLIECharlie knows what it is . Tell them . Charlie hesitates , then speaks : &nbsp; CHARLIEIt 's Fat Boy . Even Mother is surprised : " so he knew . " &nbsp; ALLIEThat 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared . Want to see him climb to the top ? &nbsp; LUNGLEYWould n't get out alive . &nbsp; ALLIEThat 's an ignorant remark . &nbsp; CLOVERDad , Charlie 's shaking . &nbsp; CHARLIENo , I 'm not . Bolstering his courage -- more accurately , hiding his fear -- Charlie enters Fat Boy . Allie closes the door behind him . CUT TO :  --  55  --  55 . INT . FAT BOY DAY Inside , Charlie 's composure fails . It 's pitch black except for light slivers through the planks . He glances around : iron pipes , greasy with sealer , rise along the walls -- the innards of a monster . &nbsp; CHARLIEOh , rats . Charlie starts climbing the midsection pipes -- what Allie called the " kidneys , "  - -  across the rusty " gizzard " toward a steel tube called the " gullet . " Charlie freezes in the darkness , listening to every sound . He hears only the distant muffled sound of Allie holding forth outside . He looks down , shaking . But he takes stock , then climbs upward . &nbsp; CHARLIELike the human body , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Charlie presses upward . One slip and he 'll fall into the darkness . He continues . Finally he reaches the top of Fat Boy . He bursts into a big smile ; then , partly out of fright , partly out of enthusiasm , frantically pounds the ceiling : bam , bam , bam ! No response . Suddenly a trap door opens : sunshine floods the plant and Allie 's face appears . He offers a hand to his son . &nbsp; ALLIEGood work , son . CUT TO : Section Details 56 . EXT . BOAT LANDING , JERONIMO DAY Several days later . The extended Jeronimo family watch as Allie and Haddy board " Little Haddy . " Mr. Maywit attempts to join them . &nbsp; ALLIEI need you here , coach . From now on you 're my Field Superintendent . I 've got to get some juices for Fat Boy . Allie quickly hugs the children , kisses Mother and jumps in the launch .  --  56  --  &nbsp; ALLIEIn the meantime , pick some tomatoes . We should be back in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He starts up the engine , pulls away . Charlie narrates as the boat disappears upriver : &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) With Father away , Jeronimo was very quiet -- no speeches , no songs , no hammering . CUT TO : 57 . EXT . JUNGLE DAY Zambu Lungley and Bucky escort Mother and the children through an uncharted section of forest . &nbsp; MOTHERFrancis , what kind of tree is this ? &nbsp; LUNGLEYThat 's hoolie . Mother dips her finger in the sap , smells it , tastes it . &nbsp; MOTHERChicle . There 's enough chicle here to make a ton of rubber . ( laughs at herself ) That 's what Allie would say . If he was here , he 'd have us all making galoshes . Jerry , make up a sign reading " hoolie " and " sapodilla " and nail it to this tree . Mother points the way as the Zambus lead on . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) Father 's work was work , Mother 's work was study and play , but she left us mostly to ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO :  --  57  --  58 .

They have built a crude " church and store " hut near the fresh-water spring . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) We found a path that led away from the river into the jungle , which was thick with screaming birds . We made our camp at a deep pool , a half hour walk from Jeronimo . Drainy and ALICE MAYWIT are Jerry 's age ; LEON and VERYL are April and Clover 's age , Just as Jerry likes to give Drainy the what-fer , so the twins enjoy lording over Leon and Veryl . &nbsp; DRAINYThey 's munsters in the water . &nbsp; JERRYThere 's your Duppy in the tree . ( Drainy frightened ) Thicko ! Crapoid ! They all laugh , but are startled as a wild pig dashes through .

I liked this place because it was filled with the things father had forbidden . Spending stone money at the store and talking on the telephone were pleasant . We called this place Acre . CUT TO : 59 . INT . MAIN HOUSE NIGHT The children lie in their beds as Mother reads by the lamplight .

CUT TO : 61 . EXT . FAT BOY EARLY MORNING Allie , back from La Ceiba , is at work on Fat Boy . Several Zambus help him haul gas drums inside the structure . &nbsp; LUNGLEYWhat you do , Fadder ? &nbsp; ALLIEEnriched ammonia . What do you think I was doing in La Ceiba -- spitting in the plaza ? No sir , I was juicing up my ammonia . The richer it is , the quicker the evaporation . He turns to Charlie . &nbsp; ALLIECharlie , get everyone over here . I want them all to see this . Mother ! Mother joins him as Charlie calls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you beside me . This is history being made here today . Francis ? You in position ? &nbsp; LUNGLEYYes sir , Fadder .

Bucky stands beside a switch-box built into the side of Fat Boy . Allie scans his audience . &nbsp; ALLIELeon , come here . You 're the youngest . You light up Fat Boy . You 'll live longest to remember this moment . Allie gives Leon a box of stick matches and instructs him where to ignite the pilot light . &nbsp; ALLIE ( to Haddy ) Bet you still do n't know what this is ? &nbsp; HADDYCooking ? &nbsp; ALLIENo guesses . Okay , Leon , light here . Leon strikes the match and lights the boiler . Everyone waits in anticipation : no sound from Fat Boy . &nbsp; ALLIEJust wait . Then there 's a GLOOP from within Fat Boy , followed by RUMBLES and GURGLES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAYWITShoo ! Smoke belches from Fat Boy 's chimney . &nbsp; MRS . MAYWITCan we pray ? &nbsp; ALLIEDo what you want , but this is no miracle -- just thermodynamics . Allie suddenly gets up and climbs the ladder alongside Fat Boy . He opens the hatch and crawls in . &nbsp; HADDYHope we ai n't have to drag him out by his stumps . &nbsp; MOTHERAllie knows what he 's doing .  --  62  --  Allie emerges from the hatchway , waving his hand . He holds a white ball , like a lump of raw cotton . He bounds down the ladder . &nbsp; HADDYWhat Fadder got dere ? Allie throws the white ball into the crowd : &nbsp; ALLIEHave n't you ever seen a snowball ? The snowball splatters across the ground . The children rush forward to touch it . Jerry makes a snowball and throws it at Drainy . But this is only the start of the Allie Fox show . . . &nbsp; ALLIEFrancis , now ! Francis Lungley turns the tap and water spews out , iced water . &nbsp; LUNGLEYDat cold water , Fadder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the amazement of the crowd a length of flat plastic piping which had lain unnoticed on the ground suddenly begins inflating . As the air rushes through it the tubing seems to come alive like a giant snake , until it reaches the house . It 's an air-conditioning duct . From the house one of the Zambus appears , moving her arms and shouting . &nbsp; ZAMBUGone cold in here , Fadder ! Father addresses the multitude . &nbsp; ALLIEThis is why I 'm here , this is why I came ! CUT TO :  --  63  --  62 . EXT . FAT BOY DAY TIMECUT . The staggering demonstration has provoked an impromtu party and while children and natives play with a large pile of snow , someone beats out a calypso style tune on a guitar , making up a song about father 's exploits . There is much shouting and leaping about as the camera eases through the crowd to come in close on Allie . He has a faraway look in his eyes as dreams begin to take shape . &nbsp; ALLIEI want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a load of ice to the hottest , nastiest corner of the jungle , where they pray for water and never see ice and have never heard of cheese in aerosol cans . &nbsp; LUNGLEYSeville like that . Seville a stewy bat-shoo place . People there eat dirt and walk monkey . They almost naked . They not Christians . &nbsp; ALLIESounds like my kind of place . CUT TO : pp. 23-39 &nbsp; pp. 64-88 63 . EXT . AGUAN RIVER DAY A large block of ice rests on a series of planks nailed to two native dugout canoes , making a sort of catamaran . It is powered by a pedal mechanism that works a stern wheel , something like the Swan boats in the Boston Public Garden . Because of its shape and cargo , Father has named the boat the " Icicle . " Allie , Haddy , Lungley , Charlie , Clover and Jerry pedal the ice block upriver . The Aguan seems to circle without purpose . Allie studies his byzantine opponent : &nbsp; ALLIESome dynamite and a few willing hands and we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice block ) At least the ice is holding up ; more than I can say for the crew . Keep pedaling . Allie takes his place and resumes pedaling . His shirt is wet with sweat .  --  64  --  &nbsp; LUNGLEYWait , you see Seville . Not possible to go further . Now and again the riverside undergrowth rustles with movement . Odd melodies -- primitive musical instruments or animal cries ?  - -  drift across the water . CUT TO : 64 . EXT . SEVILLE DAY The river has become a swamp . Ahead , faces peer through the dense vegetation . &nbsp; LUNGLEYSeville . " Icicle " runs aground . Allie calls to the jungle : &nbsp; ALLIEHello ! We 've got a surprise for you ! The faces disappear . &nbsp; ALLIEGet the duckboards . We 're going after them . You first Charlie . &nbsp; CHARLIEWhy me ? &nbsp; ALLIEBecause you 're the bravest one here , sonny . Charlie 's trapped again . Soon he is walking over duckboards across the spinach swamp . &nbsp; ALLIEStamp your feet , Charlie ! Charlie does and a tree snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and swims away . Charlie now makes every step a stamp . &nbsp; HADDYI no like this place , Fadder . They pass a group of small tufty huts that look more like beehives than homes . Monkeys , waiting to be eaten , are tied to a stake .  --  65  --  &nbsp; CLOVERWhat kind of houses are these , Dad ? Allie hugs Clover but does n't answer . Haddy swats a mosquito . &nbsp; HADDYWe could go home , Fadder . We could slap our own mosquitoes . Allie fans himself with his baseball cap : &nbsp; ALLIEThey ca n't be far away . Probably down at the drive-in hamburger stand . Could be at the gas station , waiting in line to fill up with high-test. ( calls out ) Okay , the game 's over ! We can see you ! Stop hiding -- you 're wasting our time ! Get out from behind those trees ! Amazingly , Allie 's approach works . One by one , natives emerge from the jungle . Soon , twenty men and women in ragged dresses and shorts stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; private parts are randomly visible through rips and tears . Yet , but for their clothes , they resemble Polski 's migrant workers . &nbsp; ALLIE ( to Haddy and Charlie ) Okay , go to work . They get a piece of ice from the large block on the launch . &nbsp; HADDYWhat a ' spearmint . &nbsp; CLOVER ( sounding like Mother ) He 's right at home anywhere . An old man , the GOWDY , limps to the forefront of the natives . He wears a pair of striped cut-off slacks , wire spectacles and a bicycle clip on each wrist like a bracelet . &nbsp; LUNGLEYThis is Gowdy . &nbsp; ALLIEYou Gowdy ?  --  66  --  &nbsp; GOWDY ( giggles ) Gowdy . Charlie and Haddy return with an ice block . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 've got a little surprise for you . Allie cuts open the banana leaves and hacks out a piece of ice . He hands the ice to the Gowdy . The Gowdy bobbles it , just as Polski had . The other natives take turns touching the ice . &nbsp; ALLIESo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sah . I am well , thank you . Where are you garng ? Thank you . That is good lesson . &nbsp; ALLIEHas n't the slightest idea . He 's completely in the dark . ( puts arm around Gowdy ) What 's that ? &nbsp; GOWDYHice . &nbsp; ALLIE ( shocked ) Jesus Christ Almighty ! The natives fall to their knees at the mention of Jesus ' name . Their sudden movement sends birds flapping through the trees . &nbsp; GOWDY " Ah Fadder wart never bead name . . . " &nbsp; ALLIEStop that ! Get up ! The natives continue praying . Allie turns to Francis : &nbsp; ALLIETraitor ! You gave me a bum steer . " Bat-shoo place ! " Thanks a lot . Allie turns and heads back toward " Icicle , " leaving the ice and natives behind . Clover follows . He yells back at the natives :  --  67  --  &nbsp; ALLIEA fine bunch of savages you are ! The natives examine the ice , chattering amongst themselves . Charlie turns and follows after his father . CUT TO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bow with Clover in his lap , hugging her like a big teddy bear . He looks close to tears as Charlie sits down beside him . &nbsp; ALLIEThey prayed at me , Charlie . What can you do with people who 've already been corrupted ? I thought we might inspire them , help them out , cool their fish and give them time for farming -- do all the things ice lets you do . That 's the whole point is n't it ? Give them the benefit of our experience . &nbsp; CHARLIEDo n't give up , Dad . &nbsp; ALLIEAh . What 's the point ? I know what they 'll do with the ice , they 'll cube it and dump it into their glasses of Coke , and just go haywire like everyone else . The rest of the Fox party plus one or two Seville natives arrive at the boat . Mr. Haddy tries to put a bright face on the failure . &nbsp; HADDYWe go to Santa Rosa . They like ice there , Fadder . They love ice ! But Allie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . &nbsp; ALLIEWhat 's over those mountains ? &nbsp; LUNGLEYNuthin , and more nuthin , Fadder .

Dangerous up dere . &nbsp; ALLIENo ice up there . &nbsp; LUNGLEYDat for sure , they never see ice , they never see nuthin . &nbsp; ALLIEThen that 's where we 're going . Haddy , you take Clover back , tell Mother the new plan . We 'll be back by nightfall . &nbsp; LUNGLEYBut how you gung carry ice ! &nbsp; ALLIEWe . We , are going to build a sled . Cut down some sapadillas , make up cross ties and use bamboo for runners , then we 'll rig up a harness . We 'll drag it up ! ( Allie paces about , excited ) One of the most efficient transport devices ever invented . Why , ancient Egyptians dragged rocks as big as houses when they built the pyramids . They stare at him , no one moving . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 're not going back ! CUT TO : 66 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a crude harness , haul the large block of ice on its makeshift sled . Charlie ahd Jerry lead the way , clearing a path with machetes . Allie , the veins popping out on his forehead , speaks through clenched teeth . &nbsp; ALLIENo prayin ' Gowdies , no Shouters or Dunkers or Duracells , just savages -- with tails ! &nbsp; JERRYI 'm tired . When do we rest ?  --  69  --  &nbsp; ALLIERest ? We have n't started yet . ( points to hill ) After that peak , it 's all downhill . You 'll be in your bed before dark . CUT TO : 67 . EXT . OLANCHITO PLAIN DAY The searing midday sun beats down on the procession as it nears the rise . The ice has begun to melt , leaving watery rudder trails behind the sleds . Allie sloshes forward , ignoring the mud and melting ice . Allie rushes to the top of the rise to see the valley . Charlie and Jerry follow . But there is no valley -- just another jungle plain and another mountain rise . CUT TO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie , now in harness , pull the ice sled up a 35ree ; slope . The ice block has shrunken to half its size . The melon-slice of sun sets through the trees . Reaching the top of the slope , Charlie slows to watch the sun vanish behind yet another peak . &nbsp; CHARLIEWe 'll have to go home in the dark . &nbsp; ALLIEWe ca n't go home until we deliver this ice . Allie surveys the scene : his sons sweat like beaten animals , the ice is melting ; Francis Lungley has collapsed , panting , on the ground . &nbsp; ALLIEAlright , we 'll make camp . &nbsp; JERRYBut where will we sleep ? Allie launches into a familiar tirade , but now it 's not so funny .  --  70  --  &nbsp; ALLIEWhy , just over there , across the street , in the Holiday Inn ! You two kids can lounge by the poolside while I fix us up with a couple of rooms . Want a king-sized bed ? I know I do , and I sure hope they 've got air-conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roll of quarters for the juke box , Jerry ? Play some tunes ? Charlie takes Jerry by the shoulder and leads him toward the underbrush : &nbsp; ALLIEThere goes Charlie to get a Fudgsicle . Careful crossing the road . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( weak protest ) We 're getting some wood to build a lean-to . &nbsp; ALLIE ( to Lungley ) Hear that ? Charlie 's going to show us how to build a camp . &nbsp; LUNGLEYCharlie know how . Charlie looks sharply at Francis : he must know about Acre . &nbsp; ALLIEAlright , improvise ! Charlie " know how ! " CUT TO : 69 . EXT . MOUNTAIN CAMPSITE EVENING Charlie , Jerry and Lungley have built a make-shift camp . They roast a paca rat and eat eddoe yams round a small campfire . Allie has had no part in these doings . In fact , he sits on a stump viewing them with disdain . Francis offers him an eddoe slice . &nbsp; ALLIEI 'm not hungry . Besides , I do n't eat rats and weeds .  --  71  --  Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally he cuts the proceedings short : &nbsp; ALLIEPut out the fire . You 're melting my ice . CUT TO : 70 . EXT . MOUNTAIN CAMPSITE NIGHT The dead of night : the only sounds are insects , humming wind and an insistent plink-plink of melting ice , as if someone were striking a high piano key . Charlie sticks his head out of the lean-to and watches his father beside the block of ice ; it 's a quarter of its original size . Allie sits like a white statue over a dark tomb . CUT TO : 71 . EXT . CAMPSITE DAY The ice has shrunk to the size of a football and Allie is carefully wrapping it in banana leaves . He feels the boy 's stare and looks up sharply . &nbsp; ALLIEWhat are you looking at ? This is the first time since creation ice has melted here . Think about that ! He stuffs the ice package into a small rucksack which he puts on his back as he strides off . The others slowly follow , grateful at least not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 . EXT . INDIAN VILLAGE DAY A stream runs past a village , where women kneel in mud , doing laundry . The huts look more like beehives than homes . A rawboned dog , a spider monkey clinging to its back , sniffs past them as they enter the village . &nbsp; CHARLIEThose women are doing clothes . &nbsp; JERRYSo what ?  --  72  --  &nbsp; CHARLIENo one 's wearing any clothes . True enough . The women are naked . They scatter at the sight of the Fox expedition . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 're probably the first white men they 've seen . Do n't do anything to frighten them . A second later , they 're surrounded by a band of male INDIANS . They raise their arms slowly . &nbsp; ALLIEFrancis , you 're the Moskito expert , tell them who we are . &nbsp; LUNGLEYWho are we , Fadder ? &nbsp; ALLIEWe 're friends . &nbsp; LUNGLEYFriend ! Friend ! &nbsp; ALLIENot in English , in some damn lingo . . . &nbsp; LUNGLEYAi n't Moskito . Do n't know lingo . Allie suddenly remembers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice " block " is now only a puddle . &nbsp; LUNGLEYAll wadder , Fadder . &nbsp; ALLIEThere must be some . Allie finds a piece the size of a twig . He quickly offers it to the Indians -- but it 's gone . Allie stares at his wet palms . &nbsp; ALLIEI do n't believe this . ( to Indians ) It was ice . Water like you 've never seen before -- cold , hard . Good for preserving meat , killing pain . I 'll be back . I 'll bring you more .  --  73  --  The head INDIAN speaks through black stumplike teeth : &nbsp; OLANCHO INDIANGo away . &nbsp; ALLIEDo you know how long it takes to drag ice from the coast ? Do n't blame me ! Have you ever seen ice ? Ever touch it ? &nbsp; OLANCHO INDIANGo away ! &nbsp; LUNGLEY ( tugs at Allie ) We go , Fadder . Allie stands solid in his Yankee shoes . &nbsp; ALLIEI 'm not moving . We have n't eaten since yesterday . The kids are tired . What about you , Charlie ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLIEFood ? Charlie makes " eating " gestures . The Indians walk back to the village . Allie sits : &nbsp; ALLIEWe 'll wait here . If the ice had n't melted they would have been all over us . I guess we got what we bargained for . Three skinny white men , pale under dirt and whiskers , walk toward them , carrying baskets . They are dressed in ragged trousers , broken sandals and have sallow sunken faces . &nbsp; ALLIEThis is what they did n't want us to see . They keep white slaves ! The three men ( RUCKBOOSES -- antique Creole jargon for " arquebusses , " guns ) offer Allie 's party boiled bananas , greasy corncakes and wabool . Allie eats with the others . Today 's hunger transcends yesterday 's principles .  --  74  --  Allie and the Ruckbooses speak in Spanish , which Allie then translates to the boys . As Allie talks , Charlie 's attention is caught by the sight of a weapon , an automatic rifle of foreign make , which stands propped in the doorway of a hut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should mention it to his father . Allie turns to him , talks in a low voice . &nbsp; ALLIEThese guys were captured . They do all the dirty work . They thought we were missionaries . Allie resumes his conversation . Charlie stares at the three men , then back to the gun . &nbsp; ALLIE ( to Charlie ) They want us to go . Quietly . I offered to help spring ' em but they 've got their own plans . I suggested they try and make it to Jeronimo . Allie rises slowly . The first Ruckboos hands Allie a gourd of water and some food . Allie leads the group away as the Indians watch from a distance .

Clover picks up the broken guava , smells it , takes a bite . CUT TO : 75 . EXT . ACRE DAY &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) We returned to Acre and lived like monkeys . We missed the Maywits , of course . Without them , there was no need for a store or church . Anyway , it was too hot to think of Hell . It was the dry season . No one in Jeronimo knew this . The gardens were still growing there .

ACRE DAY The Fox kids play " church " in handmade clothes .  --  77  --  &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) My birthday came and went . The river dropped fifty feet and Jeronimo became dry and dusty , but Acre remained green , fed by natural springs . Fat Boy had to be shut because of lack of water . We were afraid to tell Father about Acre . We did n't know how he would react . I was fourteen and still younger than I wanted to be . CUT TO : 78 . EXT . JERONIMO DAY Drought defines Jeronimo . Allie , Charlie , Jerry , Kennywick and the Zambus relay water from the river to the compound by bucket brigade . &nbsp; ALLIEIf only I had the hardware , I 'd do this in nothing flat . Haddy runs toward them , Mother follows . &nbsp; HADDYMen ! &nbsp; ALLIEHuh ? &nbsp; HADDYThree of them . At the edge of Jeronimo the three " prisoners , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying rifles . They reek of menace . &nbsp; MOTHERThey 've got guns , Allie . &nbsp; ALLIEI 'll handle this . Ma Kennywick and the Zambus disappear into the woods . Charlie watches as the Ruckbooses approach . Allie greets them in Spanish and to his surprise they reply in English . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSWe did n't think we would find you . &nbsp; ALLIE ( to Charlie ) They speak English !  --  78  --  &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSHow many are you ? &nbsp; ALLIEThousands -- that 's counting the white ants . We 're infested . Termites have gotten into everything and are eating us alive . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSWhere are your Zambus ? &nbsp; ALLIETook off . Saw your guns . Probably thought you were soldiers . I did n't have time to tell them you were friendly . They 're probably out dipping their poison arrows now . Right , Charlie ? &nbsp; CHARLIE ( goes along ) Right . &nbsp; ALLIEWhere are you headed ? The Ruckbooses are n't bluffed . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSWhere 's this ice machine you told us about ? &nbsp; ALLIENo water for ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there 's enough to float a cayuka to the Aguan . I 'll draw you a map . It 's about a day to the coast .

( to Charlie and Haddy ) I told you to rip down those shacks . Now get a crowbar and go do it . Charlie and Haddy scurry off to collect tools to tear down the Maywits ' house . No questions asked -- the tone of Allie 's voice says everything . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSWe do n't see any ants .  --  79  --  &nbsp; ALLIEThat 's right . If you could see them , you could kill them . Well , I 've got work to do . We 're not on vacation ! Allie strides off . The Ruckbooses follow him a few steps , until he turns to give them a cold stare . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSWe 'll look around . &nbsp; ALLIEGo down to the river . There 's a cayuka there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUCKBOOSWe 'll look around . Allie walks toward Charlie and Haddy as the Ruckbooses cross the clearing . CUT TO : 79 . EXT . MAYWITS ' HOUSE DAY Charlie and Haddy have torn off the roof and are hacking the walls when Allie joins them . &nbsp; ALLIE ( whispers to Charlie ) I thought they were prisoners of the Indians . Seems like it 's the other way around . When I make a mistake , I make a big one . Kick me , Charlie . &nbsp; HADDYI ai n't seen no hants , Fadder . &nbsp; ALLIEJust keep working . We 're going to tear down all the out-buildings . Charlie , get Jerry to spread chicken manure in the cold store till it stinks . Tell Mother what we 're doing . &nbsp; HADDYI ai n't like them friends , Fadder . &nbsp; CHARLIEWhat about Fat Boy ? &nbsp; ALLIEDo n't touch him .  --  80  --  Allie spots the Ruckbooses playing with Clover and April . His face flashes hot . This is the first time we 've seen Allie truly angry ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearing . CUT TO : 80 . EXT . JERONIMO CLEARING DAY Allie is suddenly upon the Ruckbooses : &nbsp; ALLIEGet away from those kids ! Keep your hands away from my children ! They instinctively back away . Allie , hammer poised , stares into each of their eyes -- chilling , even to armed men . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSThey are intelligent children . &nbsp; ALLIE ( lowers hammer ) They have intelligent parents . &nbsp; SECOND RUCKBOOSThey were telling us the many wonderful things you can do . &nbsp; CLOVERI did n't say anything , Dad , it was April . &nbsp; ALLIEGo mind your own business , girls . Do n't bother these men . The First Ruckboos scrutinizes Allie , his hammer ; then shrugs . Now is not the time for confrontation . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSWe 'll be back for supper . He leads his companions into the jungle . Allie escorts the girls to the Main House . Charlie and Haddy have destroyed the Maywit shack . CUT TO : 81 . EXT . MAIN HOUSE DUSK Jeronimo is in shambles . All the buildings have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House remain . The water tower lies on its side . A year 's work destroyed in a day .  --  81  --  The Ruckbooses , guns on their laps , have returned for supper ; they rest in the gazebo with the remnants of the Jeronimo community . Haddy , Charlie and Jerry are exhausted from the day 's work . Allie 's clockwork mind processes the alternatives as he studies his unwelcome guests . &nbsp; ALLIE ( amiable ) You 're staying tonight , are n't you ? &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSYes . &nbsp; ALLIEI would n't be surprised if you stayed two nights . Maybe until the rain comes and we start planting -- that 's weeks away . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOS ( cold ) We will stay until we are ready to go . &nbsp; MOTHERAllie , ask them to put their guns away . The First Ruckboos flashes her a cruel stare ; Allie notices this : &nbsp; ALLIEYou 'd be fools to leave now . The termites have n't left us much , but what we have is yours . So please , set your guns down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . They make no move to lay down their guns . The First Ruckboos and Mother exchange glances . He smiles lasciviously to the Third Ruckboos -- the cruelest of the three . Frightened , Mother goes inside . Allie picks up the conversation ; the children whisper amongst themselves : &nbsp; CLOVERI want to go to Acre . &nbsp; CHARLIEBe quiet . Allie has become quite the host :  --  82  --  &nbsp; ALLIEI first thought you were the prisoners of the Indians ! Slaves ! Was n't that something ? ( Ruckbooses laugh ) Better not sleep outside tonight . The insects get real mean -- Is n't that right , Haddy ? &nbsp; HADDYI sleeping on me launch , Fadder . &nbsp; ALLIEIt 's a good thing the bunkhouse is empty for you gentlemen . Jerry mouths to Charlie : " What bunkhouse ? " &nbsp; ALLIERight after dinner , I 'll show you where . Speaking of dinner . . . Allie holds up his hand as he walks inside . CUT TO : 82 . INT .

FAT BOY NIGHT Allie , holding a mothy light , leads the Ruckbooses toward the " bunkhouse . " They stare at the odd monolithic building . Lit by moonlight , Jeronimo looks like it did when construction began : littered with junked lumber and discarded supplies . &nbsp; ALLIE ( opens Fat Boy ) I set out a few mats for you . The First Ruckboos looks inside . &nbsp; FIRST RUCKBOOSYou 're a smart man . I think we 'll get along okay . &nbsp; ALLIEI 'm sure . CUT TO : 84 . INT . CHARLIE 'S ROOM NIGHT The awesome poetry of the jungle echoes through Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellythumping of frogs interrupted by regular shrieks of monkeys and parrots . Yet , Charlie hears SOMETHING ELSE -- something suspicious , something scary . His eyes do not move . All of his senses concentrate in his ears . SUDDENLY , a hand clamps over his mouth . His wide eyes make out his father 's shadow . Allie whispers hoarsely : &nbsp; ALLIEDo n't say a word . Get your shoes on and follow me . CUT TO : 85 . EXT . JERONIMO NIGHT Outside , they feel the immediate oppression of the insect world . Charlie watches his father . Allie 's baseball cap is tucked in his back pocket . Allie picks up a freshly cut , five-foot 24 placed against the house . He speaks softly but intensely , ennunciating each word :  --  84  --  &nbsp; ALLIEI gave them every chance to go . Even offered them my cayuka . ( Charlie nods ) But they refused . You heard them . They 're planning to fasten on us just like they fastened onto the Indians in the hills . Allie squashes a mosquito with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pity those men , Charlie . Do n't pity insects . This is not the insect 's blood ; it 's my blood . Remember those poor Indians squatting with their dogs ? &nbsp; CHARLIEThey looked scared . &nbsp; ALLIEDid they ? ( a beat ) I 'm not wrong often , Charlie , you know that . But when I am , I 'm as wrong as can be . Allie leads Charlie toward Fat Boy . Charlie watches the 24 hanging in his father 's hand : not much of a weapon to take on three armed men . They approach Fat Boy . Charlie notices that his father has already wired and barricaded the main door -- the first lock in Jeronimo . Allie speaks softly . &nbsp; ALLIECan you get up that ladder and shove this beam through the brackets on the hatchway door without making a sound ? &nbsp; CHARLIE ( wants to run away ) I guess so . &nbsp; ALLIEYou 'd better be more sure than that . You could get us all killed . Charlie braces himself , then nods again .  --  85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 and climbs the ladder . Soon , he is at treetop level . The black jungle blanket stretches as far as he can see . Charlie feels his way through pipes and valves . He reaches the hatchway . He locates two fresh iron bracket jambs . Allie must have installed them in the afternoon . Charlie places the beam between the braces ; a perfect fit . He starts back down . As soon as Charlie touches ground , Allie removes the ladder : &nbsp; ALLIEStand back . He lowers the ladder and whispers to Charlie : &nbsp; ALLIEYou did n't climb that ladder . ( a beat ) You did n't bar that door . ( a beat ) We do n't have any locks in Jeronimo . Allie squeezes his son 's arm : &nbsp; ALLIEI brought you here to test your eyes . To see if they 're as good as mine . ( points to firebox ) Look there . Somebody 's left a fire burning . There is no fire . &nbsp; CHARLIEI ca n't see it . &nbsp; ALLIE ( lights a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs . Somebody lit a fire here . I told them not to . &nbsp; CHARLIEYes . Allie 's face , lit by match light , is wild .  --  86  --  &nbsp; ALLIENo fires . Allie lowers the match to the kindling . The twigs have been soaked in oil . They whoosh into flames . Allie closes the firebox door . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 'll just have to let it burn . There 's nothing we can do about it . Fat Boy 's liquid tanks begin to swallow and burp . &nbsp; CHARLIEThe men . . . ? Allie leads Charlie back to the house . &nbsp; ALLIESome devil has done this . Start counting , Charlie . By the time you get to three hundred , they 'll be asleep . They 'll feel no pain . Before they reach the Main House , a new sound comes from Fat Boy -- the sound of GUN BUTTS RAPPING AGAINST THE WALLS . The Ruckbooses are trying to get out . Charlie silently counts . &nbsp; ALLIEIf they lie down , they 'll be alright . The hammering grows more intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls from the gazebo . &nbsp; MOTHERAre you alright , Allie ? &nbsp; ALLIEStay inside , Mother . ( to Charlie ) Keep counting . &nbsp; CHARLIE126 , 125 , 124 . . . Jerry , Clover and April join Mother . They call out : " Where 's Dad ? " " Where 's Charlie ?

But the noise grows louder ; it 's the sound of gunshots . Allie 's face turns to fright . &nbsp; ALLIEThey 're going to put a hole in him ! Haddy hops up and down . The twins cry . The sound of breaking metal . &nbsp; CHARLIE " 39 , 38 , 37 , 36 . . . . " Allie rushes toward Fat Boy : &nbsp; ALLIENo ! Fat Boy rumbles and shakes . Allie stops in his tracks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , screaming . &nbsp; ALLIEGet down ! Fat Boy bursts into a BALL OF FLAME . Charlie and Haddy 's faces are scorched with light . The explosion brings a red glow to every tree , every bush in the clearing . Allie turns away from the blast . One side of his face is fiery ; the other black . He has one red eye . Charlie stares : his father 's one red eye is fixed on him . Allie 's mouth is open , but his scream is lost in the detonation . &nbsp; CHARLIE " 20 , 19 , 18 , 17 . . . . " Fat boy lifts off its foundations , then collapses in a series of explosions which sends fiery jets of gas in every direction .  --  88  --  The dry grass burns , the trees catch fire , then the Main House . Allie pulls Charlie and Haddy toward the burning house . He calls to Mother : &nbsp; ALLIEBring the children ! Follow me ! Ammonia fumes fill the clearing . Haddy chokes : &nbsp; HADDYWe gung die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; CHARLIE " 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , . " &nbsp; ALLIEThere 's more hydrogen in the tanks . Cover your faces ! They struggle to the edge of the clearing . Allie scans the jungle , not knowing where to take them . &nbsp; MOTHERWhere are we going ? Allie has no answer . Charlie interrupts : &nbsp; CHARLIEI know a place . Follow me . Charlie takes Mother 's hand ; she takes Allie 's . Haddy follows , carrying April . Jerry holds Clover 's hand . A final gas tank blows as Charlie leads them into the jungle . CUT TO : pp. 40-63 &nbsp; pp. 89-114 86 . EXT . ACRE DAY The next afternoon .

The others just stare at him . &nbsp; ALLIE ( defensive ) What are you looking at ? His voice is flat and dull . Mother kneels beside him and touches his face : &nbsp; MOTHERYour hair is singed . &nbsp; ALLIEHad an awful night . Hardly slept a wink . &nbsp; HADDYIt afternoon , Fadder.  --  90  --  Allie looks in the direction of Jeronimo . He sniffs the aroma of ammonia and smoldering wood .

We 're getting out just in time . CUT TO : 88 . EXT . RIVER DAY The river presents a similar scene : burnt branches , floating fish . Haddy cries at the sight of his launch , totally destroyed . &nbsp; HADDYMe launch . She all I own in the world .  --  92  --  &nbsp; ALLIEWhat good is a boat without a river ? &nbsp; HADDYThe river is dere , Fadder . &nbsp; ALLIEThe river is full of ammonium hydroxide -- contaminated .

We got a walk ahead . Allie picks up April and wades through the knee-deep river of mud and ashes . In the distance the family sees a number of their Zambus , including Ma Kennywick and Francis Lungley . The only one to even acknowledge their presence is Lungley . He turns and stares at them for a moment , before turning his back and following the lonely band of refugees . Allie turns back to Mother and the others . He starts to speak . His face is crumpled : he is crying : &nbsp; ALLIEI know what you 're thinking ! Alright , I admit it . I did a terrible thing . I polluted this place . I 'm a murderer . ( April wipes his tears ) Mother ? They wanted to feed on us ! Destroy us ! &nbsp; MOTHERAllie ! We ca n't go on like this . &nbsp; JERRYI want to go home . CUT TO :  --  93  --  89 . EXT . MOUNTAIN PLAINS DAY The Foxes and Haddy make their way down a saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and resemble a ragtag , retreating army -- all except Allie , who stands tall and walks with a confident gait . Allie has stopped shaving . He speaks to Mother as he surveys the parched , brushy hills : &nbsp; ALLIEDid you see those hoolie trees yesterday ? A few weeks ago I would have lacerated them and cooked us up a pair of galoshes . But no more . Spare the trees -- let them multiply . I 'm a changed man . I 've had an Experience . CUT TO : 90 . EXT . MOUNTAINS AND RIVER DAY A high angle shows the little family struggling across a boggy marsh toward a river bank . CUT TO : 91 . EXT . RIVERBANK DAY The riverbank is piled high with all kinds of salvage --  timber , wire , torn fishnets and the like -- evidently deposited during past flooding . The family straggle out onto " the beach " and flop on the sand . Mr. Haddy points downstream . &nbsp; HADDYMe town dat way , Fadder . Brewer 's Lagoon . Maybe half-day walk . &nbsp; ALLIENo . This is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , Fadder ? &nbsp; ALLIEWe 're staying here .  --  94  --  &nbsp; HADDYI do n't know what to do ! I ai n't got nothin left .

Gives it to him . &nbsp; HADDYI ki n't take you watch , Fadder . &nbsp; ALLIEI 've got no use for it anymore . He drags Haddy 's skinny hand out of his pocket and pushes the watch over his struggling fingers . Haddy looks at Mother . &nbsp; HADDYSpeerience ! &nbsp; MOTHERKeep it . You 've been a good friend . &nbsp; HADDYBut you all like Brewer 's . Just down stream . That me family ! &nbsp; ALLIEIf it 's on a map I ca n't use it . The family one by one embrace Haddy , while Allie paces excitedly about the river beach , picking up odd bits of timber . His voice drifts over them as each takes a solemn farewell of their old friend . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beachcombing ! Just a flush toilet and a hut . I 'm a changed man . No more chemicals , no more poisons . If what you want is n't washed up on a beach you probably do n't need it ! Haddy walks slowly away watched by all the family , with the exception of Allie . CUT TO :  --  95  --  Section Details 92 . EXT . MONTAGE , THE NEW SETTLEMENT BY THE RIVER DAY As Charlie narrates , Father leads the family in building a hut solely from what he finds on the beach . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) Somehow we found what we needed . We built a latrine , then a small hut , and planted a vegetable garden . Father 's hut was like a small barge . He took care to make it waterproof , tarring its cracks to seal it from rats and moisture . One day a Zambu passed . It was then I noticed that Father , with his long , greasy beard and wild eyes , looked more the savage . Father found an old outboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was fond of saying that in the end , Robinson Crusoe went back home. But we were staying . The small hut on the bank is now complete . A pile of junk eight feet high , collected from the river , stands to one side of the hut . The contrast between Jeronimo and the new settlement is inescapable and pathetic . CUT TO : 92a . EXT . RIVERBACK , NEW SETTLEMENT DAY Clover and April pull nails out of a pile of driftwood . The boys take the nails and straighten them with an improvised hammer . Some distance away Mother washes clothes in the brown water of the river . Allie strides past the children to join her . The children watch and listen , sensing a confrontation . &nbsp; ALLIESoon as we get the crops in we 'll be self-sufficient . Self-sufficiency , Mother . That 's the new motto . &nbsp; MOTHERYour garden is imaginary . Your crops are imaginary .

HUT NIGHT The family sit scattered around a fire , finishing their meager evening meal . The night sky , outlined by the mountains , suddenly GLOWS A PALE ORANGE -- as if the sun were about to rise prematurely . The incandescent effect resembles those sometimes reported by sailors at sea -- an aurora borealis ten thousand miles off course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as it came . They turn to their father for an explanation .  --  97  --  &nbsp; CLOVERWhat was that , Daddy ? &nbsp; ALLIEOnly one thing can make the night sky light up like that .

Got out just in time . &nbsp; MOTHERAllie ! &nbsp; ALLIEYou saw it Mother . I know what I 'm talking about . That was the end . Massachusetts , tin-foil , cheeseburgers --  all gone in a blinding flash . There 's nothing to go back to . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Mother ) How long will we have to stay here , then ? &nbsp; ALLIEAnswer him , Mother . &nbsp; MOTHER ( she pauses , then responds ) The rest of our lives . Suddenly , the distant sound of rolling thunder shatters the night . The children are awed and frightened . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 're in luck -- sound like rain . CUT TO : 94 . INT .

CUT TO : 95 . EXT . RIVERBANK DAY The children work in the garden , Mother makes clothes out of salvaged sailcloth . Thunder cracks and booms , causing monkeys in the nearby jungle to cry out their " goong-goong " noise . Mr. Haddy appears from the direction of Brewers Lagoon ; he carries a bright plastic bucket . The children rush to greet him . Allie keeps working , restoring the corroded old outboard . &nbsp; HADDYBrung you some fish , Fadder ! &nbsp; ALLIEDo I look hungry ?

The river has risen and rushes in a torrent past the Fox hut . Mingling with the roar of water and the thunderclaps can be heard the terrified howling of the monkeys . CUT TO : 97 . INT . HUT NIGHT Charlie lies awake , listening to the crash of trees nearby and the sizzling smack of rain on the tin patches of the hut walls . A shutter beside him rattles , straining at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . The others are asleep , when one of the shutters is suddenly flung open by the wind . Raindrops spatter onto Charlie as he rises from his bed and reaches out to draw the shutter closed . A cold wet thing closes over his hand .

HUT , RIVERSIDE DAY It 's all hands on deck as the family fight to keep water and debris out of their hut . The rain is even heavier than the night before , but the real danger lies in the large branches caught up in the raging water and hurtling close by like battering rams . Allie , clearly frightened , is everywhere at once , shouting orders and attempting to push away branches snagging on the hut . He orders the girls inside with Mother and ties ropes about himself and the boys , then lashes them to the hut to avoid being swept away . A huge tree , narrowly missing Jerry , shakes the hut loose from its foundations and it floats free from the bank . It 's then we realize that Allie has ingeniously constructed the hut as a barge . But with the water moving at this rate and without either means of steering , or power , they are in grave danger of being swamped . Allie tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being swept out into mid-stream . He uses all his strength , acting as a kind of human anchor . Allie spots Charlie on the deck . He calls at the top of his voice : &nbsp; ALLIEHelp me ! Charlie frozen ; Allie repeats desperately : &nbsp; ALLIECharlie ! Help me ! Charlie unties his safety rope , disappears inside a moment , to return carrying something in his hand . Close on Charlie 's hand as he opens it to show his father Haddy 's spark plugs . Allie looks from the spark plugs to his son . Charlie jumps off the " houseboat " to retrieve the can of gas from its hiding place under the junkpile . He struggles back toward the boat , fighting against the raging current . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( shouting ) Found it , last week ! Allie hauls Charlie up on deck as the bank collapses and the houseboat swirls out into midstream . He clamps the outboard to the stern and works feverishly to fit the plugs . Mother joins him as he pours gas into the engine , a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MOTHERWe can go to Haddy 's !  --  103  --  &nbsp; ALLIEDead things go downstream , Mother . Life is upstream , we did n't come to run away ! &nbsp; MOTHERGive it up , Allie ! Give it up ! Her voice is drowned out by the roar of the outboard . Allie takes the tiller and swings the boat about . It buffets its way upstream , throwing spume up over its bow . CUT TO : Section Details 100 . EXT . UPRIVER DAY The rain has stopped and the jungle steams . The " house-barge " is driven by push-poles and the outboard . A thatched master cabin provides crude shelter . The legend " Victory " is scratched to the side . Allie sits in the stern at the tiller . Charlie is up at the bow , poling . Clover sits idly nearby . Something in the water catches Charlie 's eye -- a gleaming metal object floating toward them . It clinks against the side of the boat . It 's an empty can of Coke . It bobs along toward the stern . Clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call her father 's attention to it when Charlie roughly grabs her . The violence of Charlie 's action frightens her and she forgets about the can . She bursts into tears and runs to her mother . Allie surveys the jungle with delight : utter emptiness . &nbsp; ALLIELook around . We could stop anywhere we want . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( suddenly determined ) No , let 's go on . It 's better upstream . I know it . &nbsp; ALLIEFourteen years old and at last you 're showing some backbone . Charlie stands , poling all the harder . Bit by bit , more and more , the refuse of civilization floats past : a plastic detergent bottle , a sheet of notepaper . This is the trash of the old world , and it looks beautiful to Charlie . Allie does n't notice the refuse . In the distance Charlie detects a new sound : singing . Not native chants , but organized choral voices .  --  104  --  &nbsp; MOTHER ( listening ) Allie . &nbsp; ALLIEBirds . &nbsp; JERRYWho 's singing ? &nbsp; ALLIESavages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victory " rounds a river bend . Ahead , the trees clear to reveal a dock made of oil drums and planks . Set back from the river are bungalows with shiny corrugated roofs .

They play basketball ! Charlie steadies himself , then it occurs to him . &nbsp; CHARLIEMaybe it 's the Spellgoods . The others stare at him : &nbsp; CHARLIEThe Spellgoods . The preacher family from the boat . &nbsp; ALLIEI knew it was savages .  --  105  --  &nbsp; MOTHERAllie , maybe they can help us . &nbsp; ALLIEWe do n't need any help ! &nbsp; MOTHERLook at us ! Allie hitches the boat . His boots thunk on the dock planks : &nbsp; ALLIEI 've got news for these people . Allie storms toward the compound . Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bungalows -- six in number , each bordered by a well-kept flower bed . Reverend Spellgood 's VOICE echoes from within the church : &nbsp; REVEREND SPELLGOOD ( O.S. ) Jee-doff . . . &nbsp; ALLIEI 'll knock his block off . &nbsp; JERRYIs this the future ? &nbsp; ALLIEI 'll remember that , sonny . &nbsp; MOTHERLet 's go back , Allie . Let 's get out of here . &nbsp; ALLIE ( to Charlie ) She 's afraid . &nbsp; MOTHERI 've never seen you so angry . They approach the white church . It 's shadowy dark inside ; they strain to look through the windows . INSIDE : a congregation of Indians sit watching Rev. Spellgood on a 44 Advent video screen . IN VIDEO , Gurney uses a kazoo to illustrate the story of Gideon.  --  106  --  &nbsp; CHARLIEThat must be broadcast from the U.S. &nbsp; ALLIEImpossible . The U.S. is destroyed . &nbsp; JERRYWhere 's it from ? &nbsp; ALLIEThat box . It 's a video cassette . A cheap trick . The Indians think it 's magic .

CUT TO : 102 . EXT . VICTORY NIGHT Charlie and Jerry slip into the water and silently dog-paddle toward Guampu . CUT TO : 103 . EXT . GUAMPU NIGHT Charlie and Jerry sneak across the compound toward the main house . They peek in the window : INSIDE , Emily Spellgood , considerably grown , lies on the floor in designer jeans , watching the Advent with her brothers and sisters .  --  107  --  &nbsp; SPELLGOOD CHILD #1Let 's play Pac Man ! &nbsp; SPELLGOOD CHILD #2No , I want to see The Muppets again . &nbsp; EMILYStar Trek ! Rev. Gurney , tired of this petty bickering , shoves a new cassette into the VCR : &nbsp; REVEREND SPELLGOODLet 's watch something wholesome . World Crusade for Christ comes on -- organ music and Spellgood 's sonorous gospelizing . &nbsp; JERRYWe 'll be here all night . INSIDE : Emily , bored , gets up and walks out .

We 're stuck . &nbsp; EMILY ( examines him ) What happened to you ? You 're all dirty . You got smaller . Your hair 's gross . &nbsp; CHARLIEBe quiet . Charlie leads Emily and Jerry around the house .  --  108  --  &nbsp; JERRYIs America Okay ? &nbsp; EMILYBaltimore 's freaky now . They closed Dad 's drive-in church . They could n't pay the taxes . &nbsp; JERRYIs America still there ? &nbsp; EMILYAre you nuts or something ? &nbsp; CHARLIEMy father says America 's been wiped out .

Spellgood 's VOICE echoes from inside . Charlie breaks away from Emily and dashes off with Jerry . He stops , looks back at Emily , wondering what to make of her kiss . CUT TO :  --  110  --  104 . EXT . VICTORY NIGHT Mother waits by the cabin as the boys climb aboard . Attempting to be angry , she sounds scared : &nbsp; MOTHERWhere have you been ? &nbsp; CHARLIEIt was my idea . Do n't blame Jerry . &nbsp; JERRYWhere 's Dad ? &nbsp; MOTHERI thought he was with you . &nbsp; JERRYHe was lying to us , Ma . &nbsp; CHARLIEWe talked to Emily .

( shows the keys ) You can drive us . &nbsp; MOTHERAnd leave Dad behind ? I ca n't believe what you 're saying . Charlie grabs his mother by the shoulders : &nbsp; CHARLIEPlease , Ma . This may be our last chance . Wake up the twins and let 's go . Hurry , before he stops us . Mother and Charlie confront as equals : &nbsp; MOTHERWhat about me ? Do n't you think I want to go too ? &nbsp; JERRYPlease , Ma ! Please ! &nbsp; MOTHER ( voice trembling ) I ca n't think straight . &nbsp; CHARLIETomorrow will be too late . Their argument is interrupted by a FLASH OF FIRE , from Guampu . Flames leap above the compound ; bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline surrounds them . They glow in amber : &nbsp; JERRYFire ! A GREATER EXPLOSION : the generator disappears in a ball of fire . The twins cry inside the cabin . &nbsp; MOTHEROh God ! Oh God , we should 've never stopped here . Why did n't we keep going ? &nbsp; CHARLIEJerry , get the twins . ( takes Mother 's arm ) We 're getting out of here .  --  112  --  A voice booms out of the darkness : &nbsp; ALLIESit down ! Back-lit by fire , he stands knee-deep in the river . His face is wild , in orbit . &nbsp; MOTHERWhat 's happening ? &nbsp; ALLIEThe fire 's under control . No one 's hurt . I did them a favor -- nipped it in the bud . &nbsp; JERRYYou 're a liar ! Liar ! Liar ! &nbsp; ALLIECharlie , get that pipsqueak inside . We 're clearing out . Charlie stands straight , challenging his father : &nbsp; CHARLIEWe 're not going with you . Not after those lies . Not after you made us suffer for nothing . &nbsp; ALLIEGet in ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan . &nbsp; ALLIEYou ! You 've always been against me ! You 've always tried to undermine me ! You 're no more use than these kids ! Spellgood 's shouts echo from Guampu . Mother is terrified . Allie raises his hand to hit Mother . &nbsp; JERRY ( striking at Allie ) I 'll kill him . &nbsp; ALLIECharlie ! Grab those lines ! If those savages see us , they 'll be down on us like a ton of bricks .  --  113  --  Allie steps in the center of the coiled sounding chain . Charlie suddenly darts forward , grabs the chain and yanks it tight around his father 's ankles . Allie tries to move but trips himself over , coming down hard , smashing his head against the rail . ALLIE LIES ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK . A confused , stunned , half-smile grows across his face . Charlie is appalled at what he 's done . &nbsp; CHARLIEI 'm sorry , Dad ! Jerry wraps his father 's feet in rope : &nbsp; JERRYHelp me ! &nbsp; MOTHERAllie , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . In Guampu , the fire slowly succumbs to the jungle . Flashlights flicker in the compound . &nbsp; MOTHERThey 've got lights ! Allie rouses to an incoherent awareness : &nbsp; ALLIEHey ? He strains at the ropes which tie his hands and feet , but it 's too late . He bites at the binds . Charlie leads the others off the boat : &nbsp; CHARLIELet 's go ! It 's this way . GUAMPU HAS MOBILIZED . Gurney Spellgood , Mossberg Repeater in hand , surveys the smoldering settlement . He hears voices from " Victory . " &nbsp; MOTHERWhere 's Dad ? &nbsp; CHARLIEHe 's not coming . Spellgood fires a shot in their direction : &nbsp; REVEREND SPELLGOODCommunistas ! Santanas !  --  114  --  Allie , bound hand and foot , bleeding from the head , rises to his full height . His dark form is silhouetted in cobalt . Mother and the children call from the river . &nbsp; MOTHERAllie ! Here ! Allie speaks in a dead calm voice , as if he were the only sane man in Bedlam : &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another gunshot . Allie 's hit . He falls . Spellgood grows closer . &nbsp; REVEREND SPELLGOOD ( O.S. ) I 'm coming after you ! Mother , Charlie and Jerry rush back to the boat . Mother takes charge . &nbsp; MOTHERBack on board ! All of you ! They clamber onto " Victory . " Allie lies in a heap on the deck , his shirt stained with blood . &nbsp; ALLIE ( a small voice ) I 'm bleeding . Do n't leave me . I 'm alright . &nbsp; REVEREND SPELLGOOD ( O.S. ) Who 's there ? &nbsp; ALLIEI ca n't move . &nbsp; MOTHERCharlie ! Start the engine ! We 're not leaving him . Charlie knows what to do . He cuts the anchor rope , forces the twins and Jerry to lie flat on the deck as random shots zip through the air . Then he races to the stern , pulls the ripcord on the outboard . It wo n't start . A second furious tug and it coughs into life , Charlie swings the tiller and points the boat back downriver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUT TO : pp. 64-88 &nbsp; pp. 115-118 105 . EXT . VICTORY , AGUAN RIVER AFTERNOON Days have passed . " Victory " glides down the widening river . Mother sits at the stern , guiding the boat . The Foxes pass increasing signs of civilization . On shore , Indian children eat fruits as natives stretch an alligator skin across a wood frame . Allie lies in the bow . He is no longer bound : his paralysis has made this unnecessary . The twins sit to one side of their father , brushing flies from his face . Charlie sits obediently on the other side , watching guard . Allie is nothing but a talking head attached to a limp body . He 's neither dead nor alive , neither coherent or crazy -- yet he continues to speak , as if from another world : &nbsp; ALLIEI ca n't move . &nbsp; CHARLIEYou 'll get better , Dad . &nbsp; ALLIEMan sprang out of a faulty world , Charlie . It 's a bad design , the human body . Skin 's not thick enough , bones are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fangs . We were n't meant to stand up straight -- our posture exposes our heart and genitals . We should be on all fours , hairier , with tails . Look at me . Yes sir , I 'm going to live on all fours from now on . TIME DISSOLVE . High noon . Huts and campfires appear with regularity on the shore . Allie , lying prone in the bow , continues to speak . Sweat drips over his eyes , down his cheeks . Charlie has not moved from his side . &nbsp; ALLIEIt 's worse for other people . Women , Charlie , they 're in bad shape . They leak , they drip . It 's terrible about women 's bodies , how they leak . I thought I was the strongest man in the world . I 'm just pulp . Like a savage . There 's sand in my eyes ! I 'm alive but I ca n't see ! Mother !  --  116  --  Mother steps over with a thin white cloth . She places it over his face : &nbsp; MOTHERThe sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade you . &nbsp; ALLIEWe 're going upriver , Mother ? &nbsp; MOTHERYes , we 're going upriver . But they are not , and she hates this final lie . She kisses his cheek through the cloth . Allie continues : &nbsp; ALLIENature is crooked . I wanted right angles and straight lines . Ice ! Oh , why do they all drip ? Women ! You cut yourself opening a can of tuna and you die . Listen to me , grow wings and they 'll never get you ! The boat turns a corner and there it is : the wide blue expanse of the Caribbean . A lighthouse in the distance . Allie recognizes the SOUND OF WAVES . He suddenly waves his previously immobile arms : &nbsp; ALLIENo ! The white cloth falls from his face . CUT TO : 106 . EXT . BREWER 'S LAGOON DAY The Fox boat is beached on a sandy lagoon . Charlie and Jerry sit next to their father . Allie has been silent . He speaks : &nbsp; ALLIEWhere 's Mother ? &nbsp; CHARLIEShe went to get supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; over the world , others , himself .

He stares at Charlie : the delirium seems to have passed . &nbsp; ALLIEGo on . I 'll be right here . Charlie and Jerry wave to the boat as they dash down the beach . CUT TO : 107 . EXT . BREWER 'S LAGOON BEACH DAY Charlie and Jerry hear a cry in the distance , stop in their tracks , and turn to look back . Their father is gone . Now they hear Allie 's pitiful cries : &nbsp; ALLIE ( O.S. ) Mother ! Mother ! The boys start to run . Over the dunes they see him . He has crawled across the sand like a dying turtle heading inland . Hand and foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all fours , Allie collapses : &nbsp; ALLIEMother . Charlie and Jerry are now crying , running . Vultures , waiting nearby , descend as Allie collapses . The boys swat the giant birds off Allie 's sad corpse . The vultures scatter .

GRAVE , BREWER 'S LAGOON DAY The Foxes and Mr. Haddy stand about the small cairn of stones erected over Allie 's lonely grave . Haddy looks about him ; the family , still in shock , can say nothing . He takes off his hat , stares at the grave . &nbsp; HADDYYou wer n't no prayin ' man , Fadder . But if you go to God , you gung show him some good spearmints , dat for true . Amen .

Around them La Ceiba bustles , impervious to the events of the last year : everyone selling , hassling , arguing , complaining . No one seems to care whether the Foxes are coming or going . They each bid Haddy an affectionate farewell . His eyes are wet . CUT TO : 110 . INT . LA CEIBA TAXI DAY The Foxes crowd in the garish third-hand Plymouth . The driver honks as he accelerates down La Ceiba 's main drag . The driver turns on the cheap AM radio hanging from the rear-view mirror . Tinny Latin imitation disco echoes through the car . &nbsp; CHARLIE ( V.O. ) Once I had believed in Father and the world seemed very small . Now he was gone and I hardly believed in myself and the world was limitless . Part of me died with him and part of me was afraid he was still alive .
