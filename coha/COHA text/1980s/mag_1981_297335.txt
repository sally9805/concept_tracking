The first of 1,800 Cubans jailed in Atlanta go free <P> The two men , clutching their release papers and a few meager possessions , stepped out of the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary last week into bright sunshine and into a brighter world of freedom . At the foot of the steps , the pair turned back toward the prison and raised their arms in victory to friends peering out the barred windows . Ezequiel Puentes-Prieto claimed he had never despaired of being freed because " I 've never done anything wrong . " His companion Jorge Perez-Paez had not lost hope either but admitted , " I had gotten depressed about ever leaving . " <P> The two were among the first of 381 Cuban refugees ordered freed by Federal District Judge Marvin Shoob of Atlanta . Of the more than 125,000 Cubans who flooded onto the shores of south Florida last year , some 1,800 still languish in the Atlanta prison . Two weeks ago , Judge Shoob ran out of patience . Calling the Cubans " people " and " not numbers , " he ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had entered the U.S. without the proper papers . Government lawyers did not object to freeing the 155 who had already been cleared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service , but filed a motion to stay the release of the other 226 . Shoob agreed to give the INS until Sept. 8 to review those cases . Declared the judge : " The logjam has been broken . " <P> The fate of the jailed Cubans is one of the thorniest immigration dilemmas ever faced by Washington . Originally detained by the INS for admitting they had criminal records , most of those held in Atlanta have since been found " excludable " by administrative law judges . The Carter Administration had begun to develop a plan to review the cases of all 1,800 and free those judged not dangerous , but the Reagan White House froze the releases so the matter could be studied further . <P> As local legal-aid lawyers began to take on the cases of imprisoned Cubans one by one , it eventually became clear that many of the suspected " criminals " were nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for misdemeanors or for acts not considered illegal in the U.S. , and others were innocent of virtually any wrongdoing . Ignacio Ruiz de Armes , for example , told TIME Correspondent Anne Constable that he had been jailed in Cuba for refusing to serve in the armed forces as well as for stealing a boat to escape from the island . Says he : " There are many here who do not represent any kind of threat to this society . "
