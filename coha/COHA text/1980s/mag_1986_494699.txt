WHITE HOUSE WATCH THE END THE GENIALITY WENT first . When President Reagan came to the White House pressroom on November 25 , he was in a sour mood . After disclosing that he had n't been " fully informed " about the diversion of money from the Iranian arms deal to the contras , Reagan glowered at reporters who peppered him with questions as he stepped down from the podium . Ordinarily , he answers a question or two , and turns aside others with a head bob and a grin . Not this time . Pressed on whether he 'd admit to having made a mistake in authorizing the arms sale , Reagan snapped , " No , " and stalked off . The next day , without telling aides , he chatted with Hugh Sidey of Time , and his comments on the Iran mess were petulant . This is the fellow renowned For his cheerful imperturbability even in the most trying circumstances . At an airport rally in Denver last September , a loud crack interrupted Reagan 's speech . The crowd cringed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now he senses serious trouble , and his savoir faire has abandoned him . In truth , it 's even worse than he imagines . This is n't another Bitburg flap . Reagan knew that after he visited the German war cemetery at Bitburg in 1985 , the matter would fade . But the controversy over selling arms to Iran has no termination date . For Reagan , the worst is at hand . The administration has lost control of events . Suddenly it is no longer the dominant force in American politics and government . The de facto end of the Reagan presidency came at the precise moment ? noon , November 25 ? the White House disclosed that proceeds from the arms sale had been laundered and funneled to the contras . The contra angle is critical . If the issue were only the weapons deal with Iran , Reagan could handle it . " That 's a policy decision , " says a Reagan adviser , " and the fight would be over whether it was correct or not . The president would be fighting on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the possibility of law vio lations the new epicenter of the controversy . A fight over policy became a criminal case , a full-blown scandal with innumerable investigative leads . This took the matter out of Reagan 's hands , and made a special prosecutor and prolonged congressional hearings inevitable . And the press went wild . Reagan 's top aides did n't catch on any more than he did . Donald T. Regan , the chief of staff , airily dismissed calls for his ouster . " Don spent a lot of time on Wall Street , " says a Regan assistant , " and he does n't jump out of the window every time the market turns down . " Fine , but this is the Reagan presidency 's equivalent of the Depression , non-stop hard times . Under Regan 's supervision , the White House embarked on November 30 , the Sunday after Thanksgiving , on an effort to micro-manage the news . The goal : get out a story a day showing how aggressively the president was attacking the crisis and pursuingthe truth . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , " says a senior aide . " He has to show not only that he 's saying but that he 's doing things to get at the facts . " The aide claimed immediate success , pointing to the front-page headline in USA Today on December 1 . It quoted Reagan : " We 'll get to the bottom of this ... " The next day 's story was Reagan 's meeting with a special commission investi-gating the National Security Council . Then it was Reagan 's nationally televised announcement that a special prosecu-tor would he sought and that Frank Carlucci would be his new national security adviser , succeeding the deposed John Poindexter . And so on . Reagan 's aides also tried to figure out a way the president could admit to having made a terrible mistake without saying that in so many words . Before Reagan 's press conference on November 19 , Patrick Buchanan , the White House communications director , and other aides were prepared to urge the president to declare flatly , on national TV , that he 'd flubbed . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prickly on the subject ? that they shrank from recommending it . " Reagan never says he made a mistake , " says one official . " He did n't do that after the Marines were killed in Lebanon . He just withdrew the rest of the troops . He needs to do something like that again . " Finding an opportunity was n't easy . And not surprisingly , the Regan team resisted the obvious alternative , what one of them calls " the big bang solution . " That means firing Regan and his subordinates . " I thought for a second that would solve the problem , " says one of them . " It wo n't . It will only reinforce a view that 's not accurate , that all these people had knowledge of the arms deal and secret contra funding and were involved . " Do n't expect boldness from an embattled Reagan White House . In picking veteran bureaucrat Carlucci to head the National Security Council staff , Reagan took the course of least resistance . Navy Secretary John Lehman was strongly recommended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team player . Attorney General Edwin Meese , in a fit of pettiness , blamed Lehman for having publicly criticized the Justice Department 's plea bargain with spy John Walker . Jeane Kirkpatrick , the former United Nations ambassador , had some support , but Reagan did n't want to irritate Secretary of State George Shultz by appointing her . David Abshire , the U.S. envoy to NATO , had no detractors , but no strong supporters either . Carlucci had the backing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger . ( He was Weinberger 's deputy in Reagan 's first term . ) For a White House going nowhere , Carlucci was perfect . At Defense , he 'd greeted Shultz 's appointment as secretary of state with enthusiasm . Shultz was prudent and diplomatic , Carlucci said . " People like that never choose sides , " he added admiringly . Reagan 's biggest problem is how to change the subject . Taking the country 's mind off the scandal that 's bedeviling you is a major step in recovering from it . But the president ca n't manage this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . " There are n't a lot of ideas around this place right now , " says a White House official . Reagan has already gotten the main things he wanted , tax cuts and a military buildup , but still he has two years left in office . Sure , he could agree to an arms control treaty with the Soviets , but that would mean giving up on Star Wars . In November he listed " budget reform " as his top priority in 1987 . That 's not likely to take anyone 's mind off scandal . Nor is Reagan 's need to play goalie , swatting away bids to eliminate military aid to the contras and to pare spending for Star Wars . In last fall 's campaign it became clear that Reagan 's cupboard is bare . In September a dozen of his top political advisers met to decide what issue he should emphasize . According to David Hoffman of the Washington Post , there was near unanimity that he should talk about drugs . He did , pilfering the issue from his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lady 's agenda , he 's spent . H E 'S ALSO ALONE . Conservatives have rallied to Reagan 's side in the past , but they are virtually silent on the arms deal . One conservative group , Citizens for America , offered a defense , only to find itself under attack by the Manchester Union-Leader , the nation 's most stridently conservative paper . " Giving arms to a bunch of terrorists is hard to defend , " says Jeffrey Bell , a conservative strategist . " People are thrown by it . They 're not unwilling to save Reagan . But they do n't know what ground to stand on . " Human Events , the weekly conservative paper that Reagan reads regularly , chose to push for a conservative replacement for Shultz as secretary of state , and gave the president only a halfhearted defense . On December 1 , a dozen conservative leaders met in a Washington hotel and talked about distancing themselves from Reagan . Only one , William Kristol , spoke up for Reagan . The president has himself to blame . Detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words ? was bound to bring trouble sooner or later . It happened later . Now , after six reasonably productive years come two years of strife and drift . Whatever Reagan wantsfrom Congress , if he wants anything , he 'll have enormous trouble getting . He 's as circumscribed as Gerald Ford was after pardoning Nixon . When Ford picked a Supreme Court justice , he had one criterion : Can this guy get confirmed ? Reagan never expected this to happen . In one of his self-effacing jokes , he tells the story of two psychiatrists , one old , one young . They both show up each day for work scrubbed , immaculately dressed , and alert . But at the end of the day , the youngster is frazzled and disheveled , the old man fresh as ever . One day , the young psychiatrist asks , " How do you do it , stay fresh after hearing patients all day ? " The old psychiatrist pauses and then says , " I never listen . " Reagan should have .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
