 | The Bison bomber circled slowly over the Siberian steppes , struggling for altitude under the heavy load of a second aircraft-like vehicle strapped and bolted to its back . Hundreds of miles above the bomber , a United States spy satellite on routine patrol peered down through @#  | its powerful telescopic lens and recorded a series of images that quickly found their way to intelligence analysts in Washington , D.C. , early last year . The images were the Pentagon 's first hard evidence that the Soviet space-shuttle program had moved into a new phase . Transport tests , perhaps even approach and landing flights , were underway . Long the subject of rumors circulating in the international aerospace community , the Soviet shuttle ? variously code-named Albatross , Kosmolyot ( kosmos means " space " ) , and Furan ( snow ) ? is about to come in from the cold . U.S. Department of Defense experts predict that a manned Soviet shuttle will make its maiden voyage in 1988 , perhaps even before the U.S. resumes shuttle launches , now scheduled for February 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the space race . Russia 's launches will mark the beginning of a new international competition in orbit . The facts are clear . Competition for the rights to resupply space stations , service satellites , and ferry passengers to and from orbit with reusable winged spacecraft is booming . Before the year 2000 , vertical-takeoff orbiters built by the Soviets , the Europeans , and the Japanese could be flying along trajectories that the U.S. shuttle once traveled in solitude . To find out more about the aggressive space-shuttle programs sprouting overseas , I spoke with a variety of U.S. experts on the Russian space program , and with the head of the European program . Here 's what I learned . Two spacecraft could carry the Soviet red star insignia . The second , and much smaller , Soviet shuttle vehicle has already been test-flown in subscale version at least four times . The tiny craft , shuttle-like in appearance but with up-tilted wing tips , was photographed in excellent detail @# @#  | during recovery operations in the Indian Ocean by Australian military pilots in 1984 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains that it is under continuing development and may be intended for anti-satellite operations , the little space flyer could carry two cramped cosmonauts on a brief mission . Other experts contend that , because it has not been space-tested since December 1984 , the craft was part of development tests for the larger shuttle or for other advanced spacecraft . The mystery continues . At the same time , there is no mystery about a small shuttle being developed in France , with the backing of the 11-nation European Space Agency . Dubbed Hermes , the orbiter will be launched by an expendable Ariane 5 rocket , which is also in development . Hermes will carry four or more European astronauts and a 10,000-pound payload into orbit , then return for a runway landing on Earth . Its first flight is planned for 1995 or ' 96 . And in the Far East , two Japanese agencies ? the National Aerospace Laboratory and the Institute for Space and Astronautical Science ? are pursuing their own winged space vehicles . Japan 's shuttle work remains preliminary ; the government has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies have asked for approval beginning in 1987 , and hope to launch a small manned shuttle atop a disposable rocket before the year 2000 . It 's the Russians who are closest to an operational system . " We 've been watching the Soviet heavy-lift booster and shuttle programs for years , " said Marcia Smith , the leading specialist in aerospace systems at the Library of Congress and president of the American Astronautical Society . Smith monitors the Russian space program and regularly advises Congressional committees on its activities and plans . " The two programs are tied together , and they 're getting ready to fly at last , " she told me . Activity in the Russian program accelerated sharply in the past two years . Photographs of the Soviet launch facility at Baikonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam taken last summer by the French SPOT earth resources satellite PS , Feb. show that construction of a huge vertical assembly building , similar to the National Aeronautics and Space @# Administration 's facility at Kennedy Space Center , in Florida , has been completed . The photos also show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a road-andrail system for moving large vehicles , and a 15,000-foot runway to be used by shuttle orbiters returning from space . Nicholas Johnson , advisory scientist at Teledyne Brown Engineering in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and author of the respected annual report The Soviet Year in Space , questions whether spy satellite photos showing the orbiter-Bison combination mean that approach and landing tests have begun at Baikonur . " We do n't know if the Bison is physically capable of carrying a reasonably loaded shuttle to altitude . Carrying an orbiter shell and a full-up vehicle to drop altitudes are two very different things . " Other experts are convinced that drop tests indeed began in early 1986 . At least one near-accident occurred during transport tests . While landing at Baikonur with the orbiter still attached , a Bison bomber skidded off the runway . Satellite photos taken in the spring of 1986 luckily caught the incident almost as it happened , according to the Pentagon , but did n't reveal whether aircraft or spacecraft was damaged . The Russians are n't saying . Considering the risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle flight will be unmanned . " They have auto-land capability and do n't need a crew , " Smith told me . " So do we , but our astronauts wo n't use it . They want to be in control . But I expect maybe two unmanned tests before the Soviets fly cosmonauts . They are incredibly conservative in their program . It 's probably because of the level of confidence they have in their technology . We just have more confidence in ours . " Because of winter weather constraints , the Russians typically fly first missions of new hardware in late February or March . If that pattern holds , the countdown for an un-  | manned Soviet shuttle launch may have already begun . At first glance , the Soviet orbiter spotted on the Bison bomber is a near-twin to its American counterpart . " It has the same overall shape , " a military analyst said , " right down to the delta wings . " Given the implacable laws of aerodynamics , that similarity is expected . Its payload bay is about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 43-foot-long , 13-foot-diameter space station module similar to the unit now hooked to Salyut 7 . Such add-ons could be ferried up to the huge new Soviet space station , Mir , orbited last February . Mir has six docking ports , two for spacecraft and four ready to accept habitation or laboratory modules . More likely , new modules would be sent into space atop disposable rockets , then rendezvous and dock with Mir automatically , says one NASA expert . The Russians have perfected and repeatedly demonstrated that technique . Their shuttle could also retrieve modules and return them to Earth for repair and refitting . And it could haul components of the even larger space station the Soviets are expected to put into orbit in the late 1980s or perhaps early ' 90s . " The Soviet shuttle payload capacity is about 65,000 pounds , " said Johnson . " That 's virtually identical to our shuttle in its original version . " However , the Russian shuttle may carry as much as 10,000 pounds more than the revamped U.S. shuttle . U.S. payloads will be smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase liftoff weight . There are other significant differences between the American and Soviet shuttles . Drawings released by the Pentagon ? it wo n't release actual spy satellite photos ? show that the Soviet orbiter 's wing tips are more sharply angled than the rounded tips on the U.S. shuttle . That could give the Russian ship better stability during atmospheric flight . The drawings also show that the Russian vehicle lacks the three large main rocket engines that help power the U.S. shuttle off the launch pad . In their place , Soviet designers put a pair of powerful jet engines and a limited fuel supply that gives their craft a " go-around " capability . American shuttles ? originally designed with such engines but changed for budget reasons ? reenter the atmosphere and glide to a landing without power . If the Russian shuttle misses its first landing attempt , experts told me ,  | there is just enough fuel to go around and make one more try . " It 's a little added safety factor , " a military analyst told me . " Whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , the Russians think it is . " Without on-board rocket engines , the Russian shuttle will get its launch power from a new family of boosters . The SL-16 , a medium-lift booster , uses cryogenic fuels . It 's the first Russian rocket to move away from traditional chemical fuels . Cryogenic fuels , typically liquid hydrogen and oxygen , have been used by U.S. rockets since the late 1960s because of the additional thrust they provide . According to reports published by the U.S. Department of Defense , the Russians will use the SL-16 as both a separate launch vehicle and as a strapon for a heavy-lift booster . As a standalone booster , according to Pentagon officials , it could be used to put the smaller reusable spaceplane into orbit . But its more innovative use will be as strap-ons for the larger shuttle . Four SL-16s will be attached to a large external fuel tank . The orbiter spacecraft will ride atop the fuel tank in a configuration remarkably similar to the U.S. system . An additional set of engines will be located at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully launched at the end of last July , " Johnson told me . " We can expect to see a lot more activity in that area . That technology is directly linked to their shuttle . They just have to iron out a few wrinkles before they strap them together and put up a shuttle . " With the boosters , the Soviet shuttle launcher has less thrust than the 7.5 million pounds generated by the Saturn 5 rockets developed for moon missions , but much more than anything now in the Russian inventory . An even larger heavy-lift Soviet booster , with six or more SL-16 strapons and additional upper stages , would be able to carry massive cargoes of about 220,000 pounds in place of the orbiter , the Pentagon says . European independence The European shuttle , Hermes , is smaller and less ambitious than either the Russian or American versions . So far , the only Europeans to reach orbit have ridden the U.S. shuttle or visited Russia 's Salyut 7 space station . Hermes ' development signals the growing determination of Europe to chart its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward-looking vehicle that will give the Europeans an independent man-in-space capacity . I talked at length with Bernard Deloffre , Hermes program director , at @# his temporary office near Paris . The program has since moved to expanded quarters at the large French space center in Toulouse . " Our studies began ten years ago on how to perform work in space , " Deloffre said . " As in the United States , we had controversy about whether work should be automatic , using robotics , or should use people . Finally it turned out that a manned vehicle would be desirable for Europe , and the concept of Hermes came about . " ESAs 11 member-states met in early 1985 to define their objectives for the next decade . They settled on three : an autonomous capacity to work in space , first in a European module attached to the U.S. space station Columbus , then in their own free-flying space station module ; the construction of Hermes ; and the development of a large Ariane 5 rocket that is an integral component of the shuttle package . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and servicing missions to satellites or free-flying platforms . But its most important role will be to ferry people and equipment to and from space stations . " We intend to have access to all of them , " Deloffre said , " including American , Russian , European , and Japanese stations . Hermes will be fully compatible with whatever is up there . " Though far smaller than the U.S. shuttle , Hermes will be able to stay in orbit longer than the American eight-day maximum . " Our mission requirement is for eight to sixteen days in space alone , " Deloffre told me , " and up to ninety days when docked at Columbus . We 've been asked to study thirty-day autonomous missions , but that would require extra kits in the cargo bay . It may be easier to simply dock at a space station for thirty days . " In its initial design by principal contractor Aerospatiale and aerodynamics subcontractor Dassault Aviation , the giant French aerospace companies , Hermes is 58.7 feet long , and it stands barely 16 feet high . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be cramped . The stubby vehicle has sharply upswept rudders at the tips of its delta wings . Upper and lower elevons extend from the wings ' trailing edges , and a single body flap will be mounted beneath the rear fuselage . " The final shape wo n't be locked in until 1991 , " Deloffre said . " But its cargo bay will almost certainly be five meters about 16 feet long . That corresponds to the width of the U.S. shuttle bay , so some of its cargoes could go on Hermes . " Ariane 5 , the rocket that will launch Hermes , will have a one- or two-stage n AD CrIDAIr cryogenically fueled core and two solid-fuel strap-on boosters . With two core stages , Ariane 5 will be able to put two satellites ? together weighing more than 17,000 pounds ? into geostationary orbit . With a single core stage , it could carry 33,000 pounds to low orbit or 11,000 pounds to geostationary orbit . Finally , the single-stage version would loft Hermes into space . All launches will come from the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermes will also land at Kouru , touching down on a standard 11,500-foot runway . Like the U.S. shuttle , Hermes will return to Earth as an unpowered glider . Thermal protection during reentry is a major concern . Hermes will not use the expensive and delicate tiles that have troubled the U.S. shuttle . " We 're looking at materials that are lighter and less fragile , " Deloffre told me , " probably ceramic or metallic shingles . And not small pieces like tiles , but large pieces up to one square meter . " Internal power for Hermes will come from fuel cells , probably ones developed in the U.S. " The only fuel cells working in space now are American , " Deloffre said . " We 're glad to use them , but we 're looking at ways to make them lighter and more efficient . " The European Space Agency is also looking at advanced lithium batteries as a fuel-cell alternative . Hermes will be a state-of-the-art vehicle in other ways , Deloffre explained . Its cockpit will use the latest flatpanel displays ; flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the in-flight software will allow the computer to make many routine decisions for the crew . " We 'll use the best of the technologies available , " Deloffre said , " but that means the technologies will be locked in by ' 88 or ' 89 if we intend to fly in ' 95 or ' 96 . " The agency will build only two Hermes vehicles , at a projected cost of about $2 billion . Unlike NASA , which must fight each year for funding and always gets less than it asks for , European nations commit funding in advance for a complete project , plus a 20 percent overrun . Deloffre said the Hermes budget includes six approachand-land tests with an operational Hermes dropped from the back of an A300 Airbus , and one flight into space . " It certainly is n't enough , " he said frankly . He expects the final cost to rise , and is already pressing for an additional Hermes . " If anything goes wrong , we 'll need that third vehicle . " " Space flight is a risky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will always be risky , and we have to plan for it . " i
