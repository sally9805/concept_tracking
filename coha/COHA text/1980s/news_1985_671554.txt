In essence , the mood of uncertainty stems from the assumption that the Socialists are going to lose the elections , leading to a situation in France whereby President Francois Mitterrand , whose term does not end until 1988 , will have to govern with a rightist Prime Minister and government pledged to oppose his policies. // The mood of uncertainty can be seen in several ways : in a new tension and complexity to political life ; in a slowness , a wait-and-see attitude in the governing bureaucracy ; in a constant hum of speculation about who in this country will wield real power after March , the President himself or the majority in the National Assembly. // " For the first time in 25 years , there is the feeling that an election will not solve the political problem , " said Jerome Jaffre , the political director of a major opinion research firm here . " The consequences are that the French people understand the political situation less well and have less faith that politics can resolve their problems. " // // Expectations of Instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the polls and even the pessimistic predictions of some Socialist leaders will turn out to be incorrect and , after the elections of March 16 , the party will continue to hold its majority in the National Assembly . Yet the belief that this will not happen is widespread , and it already colors virtually every aspect of political life , leading in particular to the assumption that the election will begin a period of considerable instability in France and could even lead to a genuine constitutional crisis. // Specifically , this is what seems likely to happen if the right takes control of the Parliament : // First , Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the French Cabinet would have to step down to be replaced by another figure who would govern under President Mitterrand in an arrangement never before seen - but these days frequently discussed - that goes by the name " cohabitation. " // Second , according to the views of many in this country , the right would try to overturn Mr. Mitterrand ' s program , pressing intentionally for a crisis . This in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powerlessness or to dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections . If the right were returned to power again , the President would then have little choice but to resign before his term ends in 1988 . <> <> Questions About the Leaders // What all of this means is that some of the basic questions about the French leadership will remain open even after March 16 : Will Mr. Mitterrand remain as President ? Will he be able to govern with a rightist majority ? What authority will he have ? // The answers to these questions , some political commentators say , will not be in the ballot boxes. // Jean Poperen , the deputy chairman of the Socialist Party , said in a brief telephone interview , " The situation has introduced tension and nervousness into political life . " Specifically , political life here is colored by the expectation that after the elections the Socialists will no longer run the Government , an element that has introduced both considerable harshness and greater complexity into current debates. // One recent issue , involving a Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in a country where the Government has always had a monopoly on broadcasting , caused a major storm recently in large part because of the end-of-an-era mood . <> <> Accusations of Opportunism // In an action that called forth a crescendo of denunciations , Mr. Mitterrand pushed through legislation giving a license for a new television station to a French-Italian consortium , some of whose members are personally close to him . A common perception has it that Mr. Mitterrand acted when he did in order to get the station started while he still enjoys a parliamentary majority. // The right , on the other hand , has accused him of opportunism and of abuse of power , and has vowed to reverse the plan after the elections . The result is that nobody knows for sure whether there will be a new station or not , though the best betting seems to be that the process set in motion by the Socialists is irreversible. // To many of the French all this will seem a normal part of what , with a degree of cynicism , is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . " The phrase suggests that some of the common tone of moral outrage adopted by French political leaders is just part of the game played by the ambitious. // The usual political game has been compounded by a sense of disarray in the Socialist camp as each major figure calculates what will be best for him in the future . One Socialist leader , Michel Rocard , a former Agriculture Minister and likely presidential candidate in 1988 , caused a storm earlier this month when he openly predicted in an interview with Newsweek magazine that the Socialists would lose the March elections . <> <> Speculation on Relations // At the same time , speculation abounds here that Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Fabius are no longer in a mood to cooperate with each other . This notion gained currency earlier this month when , in a highly unusual move , Mr. Fabius publicly questioned Mr. Mitterrand ' s reception of the Polish leader , Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski . The Prime Minister said he was " personally troubled " by the President ' s action. // Mr. Fabius ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would contribute to an image of disunity before the elections . Beyond that , Mr. Fabius , whose popularity had dipped sharply , seemed in the eyes of many here to be separating himself from the President . The Prime Minister , according to this view , knows that he will not be in office after March ; thus , he seems to be trying to enhance his longer-term status as a political personality in his own right by differentiating himself from Mr. Mitterrand. // Then , Mr. Mitterrand himself added to the sense of a split . In an hourlong television interview - in which he mentioned Mr. Fabius ' s name only once - the President said he alone was responsible for the Government ' s program . He went on to say that whatever party emerged with a majority , " The President of the republic will entrust it with the charge of governing. " // In the epigrammatic , allusive vocabulary characteristic of this politically uncertain time , Mr. Mitterrand seemed to be confirming a division of interest between himself and his fellow Socialists , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and President even if my party goes down to defeat. //
