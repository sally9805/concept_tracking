" I do not like carving the world into segments ; we are one world <P> Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi arrives in Washington this week for her first official visit in nearly eleven years . Her mission is to narrow India 's differences with the U.S. on a number of issues . Among them : Washington 's vocal opposition to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan , the sale of 40 American F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan and the controversial U.S. naval base on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean . The Prime Minister 's son , Rajiv , her heir apparent , will accompany her on the trip . On the eve of her departure , Gandhi discussed foreign and domestic problems in an exclusive interview with TIME 'S New Delhi bureau chief Marcia Gauger . Excerpts : <P> On relations with the U.S. We think we should be friends and want to do everything we can for friendship . Of course , we can not jettison our basic policies . They are not thought up , they are thought out-considered . The tendency in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or not with you . This is not realistic . You can be with a person on some issues and not on others . My goal is to try to show the reality of India , that it is a country with enormous problems but trying to solve them , that it is a country committed to democracy , to peace in the world and to nonalignment . It is equally important to get to know President Reagan better , to understand U.S. policies and to create greater comprehension of our policies . I have met the President only for a very brief moment , but I found him a very open person and very easy to talk to . <P> On relations with the Soviet Union . I do not think there has been any cooling of relations . Our policy has always been based on certain principles and what we consider our national interest . So it can not swing from side to side . We believe that we should have friendship with all countries and that friendship with one country or group of countries should not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the subject of Afghanistan , we have made our stand very clear . We are opposed to a foreign presence , whether in the shape of troops or any other type of interference , anywhere . Everybody rushed in at once to condemn the Soviet Union . We said we disapproved , but we did not join in the condemnation because we felt that it would not improve the situation . We have said from the beginning that there has to be a political solution in Afghanistan , a negotiated settlement .
