Presidential Candidate John F. Kennedy was dubious . Said he to the obscure University of Minnesota professor : " They tell me you 're an economist , but you 're the first that I 've met from outside Cambridge , Mass . " Kennedy , however , quickly got over his hesitation about accepting advice from someone unconnected with either Harvard or M.I.T. Walter Heller was so persuasive  --  and so adept at translating economic jargon into everyday language  --  that the whole nation came to listen , and profit . When he died last week of a heart attack at 71 , he had been out of Government office for 23 years , but his high- pitched Midwestern twang still rang loud in every debate over economic policy , commanding the respect even of Republican economists who disagreed with his Democratic Keynesianism . Says Alan Greenspan , chairman-designate of the Federal Reserve Board and Heller 's longtime colleague on TIME 's Board of Economists : " Walter was clearly one of the giants of economics in the post- World War II period . " <P> When Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the start of the Kennedy Administration , the U.S. was just beginning to climb out of a slump . Fearing the recovery would be insufficient , Heller developed the idea of measuring the economy 's performance not against past figures but against what it might reach while growing at full potential . That idea has long since become axiomatic for policymakers , but in 1961 it seemed radical . Heller believed such growth required a cut in the then towering income tax rates that in his view were strangling expansion  --  and never mind that the budget was already in deficit . It took more than a year for Heller to convince Kennedy and two more years before a skeptical Congress came around . But once the tax cut was passed in 1964 , the economy entered what now seems to have been a golden age . The upturn that began in 1961 continued for 100 months , still a record , while unemployment shriveled and inflation remained low . <P> Heller , however , was no doctrinaire expansionist . After leaving office in 1964 , he saw clearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vainly to persuade Lyndon Johnson to raise taxes again to pay for the Viet Nam War . Though he lost that round  --  and had to watch while war-driven inflation soared  --  he retained his influence as a professor , an inveterate witness before congressional committees and a counselor to Democratic politicians .
