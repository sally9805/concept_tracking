txt Computers are the latest battleground in the contest among airlines for passengers . Carriers are competing to install automated reservations terminals at travel agencies , which account for 65 ' of all bookings . The airlines do n't make money when they lease the terminals . But they hope that the systems will influence agents to choose their flights instead of competitors ' . " The automation war is fierce . Every agency is being pursued , " says Richard E. Murray , in charge of American Airlines ' Sabre reservation system . Adds Barry A. Kotar , director of United Airlines ' Apollo network : " It 's a distribution system that 's vital to our health and will become more important in the future . " The reservation systems contain information on nearly all schedules and fares . But a carrier can bias a system in its favor by assuring that the computer lists its schedules first when asked for route information . United , American Dominate Some critics say the reservation systems can be used even more directly as weapons against competitors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to drop another airline 's listings  --  and in one case , that has already happened . ( Carriers that do n't offer reservations systems usually pay to get their schedules on the computers . ) United and American have dominated the reservations business since the first commercial computer systems came to market in 1976 Together they have recruited nearly 10,000 agencies-85% of the automated agencies and 55% of all travel companies . Both claim market leadership . Now they 're going to get competition . Eastern Airlines and Northwest Airlines have announced new systems in recent months . Trans World Airlines , which already has 1,000 subscribers on its PARS network , is going after smaller agencies with PARS-2 . And last year , Tymshare Inc. in Cupertino , Calif. , entered the market with a system it bought from International Telephone &; Telegraph Co . With most systems , travel agents can store information about frequent customers , such as their telephone and credit-card numbers and preferences for flights , seats , meals , hotels and cars . They can also save time by reissuing dozens of tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets , seat assignments and boarding passes . And they can quote complicated international fares without testing their math skills . PARS and MARS A typical package , which includes four terminals , two ticket printers , training and maintenance , costs an agency about $800 a month . TWA leases a PARS-2 terminal and printer for $150 monthly . Peter T. , staff vice president of passenger service planning , figures it will appeal to companies with as little as $500,000 in annual sales . " We 've entered a whole new market no one else was touching , " he says . In the future , more systems will let agents connect with numerous airline computers from Just one terminal , providing a firsthand look at the latest fare and schedule changes . The 700 agencies on Tymshare 's MARS-Plus network have access to the computers of seven airlines , PARS-2 and Northwest 's Polaris system are multiaccess ; Eastern offers a variation of it , and American will introduce it this year . In Waterville , Ohio , Travel Horizons Inc. uses MARS-Plus to save money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a fare-scanning technique that produces four low-cost alternatives for any destination or schedule . The 20-minute scan costs $8.75 . Owens-Illinois Inc. , Toledo , tested the system last year and found potential savings of $1 million a year , or 10% of its travel budget . American and United also compete in the growing market for travel accounting and management services . They lease comput- ers and programs , that , when connected to automated systems , can produce invoices , sales reports , cash-flow projections , market analyses and other business services for agencies and their corporate clients . TWA plans to offer a business system this year . Other automation features coming : word processing , budget planning , faster fare updates , improved international pricing and fare shopping techniques , and direct links with hotel and car rental agencies . American is bringing Deak-Perera Inc. , the foreign currency exchange concern , into Sabre to update foreign conversion rates several times a day . The new program will allow Sabre agents to get foreign drafts , order international travelers checks and draw checks on international banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agents complain of mechanical breakdowns , bias , inaccuracy and increasing complexity . It can take as long as a year for agents to become fully proficient with automated terminals . Some ca n't adapt . An agent in Philadelphia rarely uses the thousands of dollars of computer equipment he bought because it intimidates him . The potential power of the systems against competitors has already been demonstrated . Last month , United and American decided to charge for booking tickets on other carriers . The two giants say they are losing money on the service and want to recover costs . American wants to charge Muse Air in Texas S2 per booking . " We feel it 's an unjust charge . It ca n't be costing them that much to service us , " grumbles Edward W. Lang , Muse 's vice president , marketing . But Muse , a relatively new airline , will probably pay the fee rather than lose the ticketing arrangement , which is the primary benefit of being included in the computenzed reservation system . " We do n't have a choice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People Express , however , refused to pay United 's fee and has been dropped from the Apollo system . That alarms Charles A. Moore , an official of the American Society of Travel Agents . " If they leave a Muse or a People Express out now , how long would it be before American tries to drop United ? " he asks . " One of these days , we could have a real airline battle via computer . "
