YOUR NUTRITION &; YOU THIS WEEK 'S column is by way of apology to the many readers ( too many , I 'm afraid ) whose unanswered letters sit in heaps in my study . Seems like ever since I published If You Do n't Like It , Do n't Eat It I 've been fighting a losing battle to keep up my correspondence with thousands of people around the country who appreciate my plain-speaking approach to diet and health and who want to discuss their individual dietary plans with me . I wish I could answer every letter personally . I know all too well what it 's like to wander alone in a wilderness of nutritional dogma . To those of you who find yourselves hopelessly confused by all the television diet gurus and esoteric health food treatises , I say , Do n't give up ! Keep searching for the eating program that 's right for you ? keep experimenting on yourselves and your families ? and do n't be afraid to buck the experts and their conventional wisdom ! The following is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my readers will see a little bit of themselves in the questions , and learn from my answers . Q : For the past ten years , my husband and I have been lactovegetarians , and we believe it is the diet God intended man to follow . It gives us great vitality and alertness , as well as a feeling of inner calm . I can honestly say that I no longer feel even the slightest desire to eat meat of any kind ? in fact , the thought actually makes me a bit ill . Nowadays , the only time I ever stray from my diet is when I get the urge for some polyvinyl chloride . I do n't know why it is , but those little plasticized fibers have a flavor that I absolutely adore . Once a week or so , I 'll go out to the waste disposal bins at the local electronics plant and come home with laundry bags full . Then I 'll sprinkle the fibers on salads , main dishes , even desserts . When my husband teases me about this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinful treat . Do n't you agree ? A : Often many of us forget that our appetites are a natural extension of the needs of our biochemistries . When we feel a strong craving for one substance or another , it usually means that our bodies lack that substance , and we should replenish our supplies . In your case , your body is telling you that you have electronic circuitry with dangerously exposed wiring somewhere inside you , and it 's time to coat those wires with a reliable industrial insulator ? like polyvinyl chloride fibers . Had you let yourself be ruled by your conscience , and denied yourself this " sinful treat , " chances are you would now be suffering from debilitating electrical shorts . So go ahead , eat up , and bon appetit ! Q : As the mother of a large family , I see to it that we get three well-balanced meals each day , with plenty of meats and fish , fresh vegetables from our garden , and big , heaping bowlfuls of pure powdered Kepone ( that stuff farmers used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now if we could only get rid of this doggone twitching of the neck muscles which causes our heads to jerk violently at unpredictable intervals , everything would be perfect . Any suggestions ? A : Like all responsible members of the medical profession , I am often forced to admit that we do not yet have all the answers . I would need more details about your diet and overall health picture before I could make any definite statements about the symptom you describe . Could it be that you are getting too much vitamin D ? If you are taking a D supplement and eating foods ( such as dairy products ) which have D added , that may be causing a buildup . Vitamin D is fat soluble and thus remains in the system , and it can be toxic in large amounts . Also , you may have a case of what we call " innocent " or " whimsical " twitching ? a muscle contraction that the body performs every so often , apparently just for the fun of it . If your symptoms persist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lift with your legs , not your back , in order to distribute the strain more evenly . ( 2 . ) Do n't hesitate to ask for help with precision tasks such as passing a truck on the freeway or trimming the kids ' hair . ( 3 . ) Wear loose-fitting clothing . These guidelines may not cure the condition , but they will at least make it easier to bear . Q : Last year I decided to quit drinking , and I began to sample various nonalcoholic beverages looking for one I liked . Tomato juice with Tabasco , herb tea , carbon tetrachloride , soft drinks , Perrier and lime , reactor coolant , tonic water , **25;2872;TOOLONG ( C-56 ) on shaved ice , lemonade ? I tried them all , but none seemed quite right . Then one evening I was at the home of a dry cleaner friend of mine , and he offered me some chlorobenzene . Wow ! I 'd never tasted anything like it ! It had a delicious , almondy flavor combined with a bracing , almost overpowering astringency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right then and there , it became my beverage of choice . Since I 've been on the wagon , I feel much better ( aside from a pesky red rash on the backs of my legs , along with weight loss , dizziness , and this darn second row of teeth I 've started to grow ) , but if it were n't for chlorobenzene , I 'd probably have gone back to the bottle long ago . I 'm wondering ? why is n't this wonderful product on the shelves at my supermarket or beverage store ? I am forced to purchase it from dry-cleaning supply houses . A : Do n't ask me ? ask the high panjandrums at the Food and Drug Administration ! They 're the ones who have chlorobenzene trussed up in red tape that limits it to commercial use only . Notoriously finicky eaters themselves , these career bureaucrats delight in dictating the menu for all America . And of course , it is you and I , the consumer , who must suffer . We can only hope that one day our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens as if they were all still in short pants , incapable of making the simplest decision about their lives . As for that second row of teeth you 've developed ? remember that twice as many teeth means you should be brushing twice as long . Recent studies have shown a clear link between oral health and the health of the body as a whole . Q : I love lead ? have ever since I was a youngster . I was raised on crunchy lead-based paint flakes , bite-sized toy soldiers made of lead , and good old-fashioned lead pencils . Today my kids and grandkids live in a completely different world . When they want something to chew on , they reach for the modern acrylic-based paint flakes , or plastic army men , or ersatz fruit-flavored marking pens . I tell them they do n't know what they 're missing . They call me an old dinosaur . Then they say that they 've heard lead is bad for you . This gravels me , because I 've been eating lead for years and am in perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which causes me to walk in tight circles . I 'm all the time trying to get them to try a little lead , and they 're always trying to get me to cut down . Neither of us will budge an inch . Who 's right , them or me ? A : If lead is harmful to human beings , this is the first I 've heard of it . I suppose if you ate enough of it , it might be , but you 'd have to eat a tremendous amount , much more than any one person is likely to want . You might ask your young relatives , if lead is so harmful , why did the Romans , rulers of a vast empire , install drinking fountains made of lead in every entrance to their Coliseum ? Most people today are unaware of that fact , as they are of lead 's other benefits . Today , as always , lead 's worst enemy is public ignorance . You might also remind the skeptical younger folks that fifty years ago , central nervous system damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . Back then , if you had central nervous system damage , you did n't go looking for scapegoats among the heavy metals . You just changed into some loose-fitting clothing and went about your business ? a prescription I am sure we would all find every bit as valid today .
