The report , one of the most thorough independent studies ever made of the Chinese economy , offers a strong endorsement of the pragmatic policies of Deng Xiaoping , the 81-year-old Communist Party leader who has been in control since 1978 . One of the report ' s central themes is a call for still greater play for market forces , decentralization and foreign investment , the cornerstones of Mr. Deng ' s approach . The report urged greater use of the marketplace to " stimulate innovation and efficiency " through cost cutting and quality control. // At the same time , the 183-page document , which was released late last week , strikes a cautionary note on a number of issues , including Mr. Deng ' s goal of catching up with the economic standards of the leading Western nations by the middle of the 21st century . The report states that this will require annual growth in per capita income - currently at about $300 , on a par with Haiti - of as much as 6. 5 percent . According to the report , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have approximated such rapid growth since 1960. // // Adjustments in Plans // The World Bank study is more sanguine about the prospects of accomplishing the two key targets set by Mr. Deng for the year 2000 - a fourfold increase in the 1980 gross output value , to $1 trillion , and a national per capita income of $800 . But it warns that various inefficiencies and bottlenecks , including serious problems in transportation and energy , could jeopardize these targets , and that adjustments in current plans may have to be introduced to make them possible. // Referring to Mr. Deng ' s aim of making China the first Communist country to rival the performance of the advanced capitalist nations , the survey states that " major , though uneven , progress toward this goal was made in the past three decades . " It adds : " During the next two decades there could be substantial further progress . The foundations for rapid and equitable growth in the 21st century could also be laid . But this will require steering a difficult course. " // The World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 , an amount that makes China one of the bank ' s largest clients , and by far the biggest among the handful of Communist nations that belong to the 148-country agency . This made it possible for the bank ' s economists to gain an unusual degree of access to Chinese data during the 18 months that the report was in preparation , reflected in the study ' s impressive range of statistical and other information. // While lauding the initiatives taken by Mr. Deng , and citing the " periods of acute economic mismanagement " in the past , when growth was disrupted by political upheavals under Mao Zedong , the report reflects an awareness of the keen political sensitivities that underlie economic policy here . <> <> Detailed Recommendations // Nonetheless , some of the detailed recommendations seem likely to play directly into the debate that is under way between Mr. Deng and his followers and the more conservative and orthodox wings of the party , which have been warning of the " chaos " and moral decline that will set in unless the trend toward increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked . Some analysts believe that the criticisms could be the harbinger of a major power struggle after Mr. Deng dies. // For one thing , the report implies some uneasiness with the rapid growth rates set by Peking , which envisages per capita income increases of 5 percent and industrial output growth of 8 percent a year between now and the end of the century . It describes the income target as feasible if the country meets its goal of keeping population growth to a maximum of 200 million , but warns of the " fluctuations , shortages and inefficiency " that have resulted from unrealistically high growth targets elsewhere. // In addition , the report suggests that the emphasis on increases in output could leave the Chinese with a seriously underdeveloped service sector , in the pattern of the Soviet Union . To correct this , and to avoid other pitfalls in the present course , it outlines " an alternate development plan . " The plan would involve a net shift of priorities toward individual economic welfare at the cost of some shortfall in the gross increments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it suggests that by cutting the proportion of national income devoted to investment to 26 percent , from the current 30 percent , the Government could foster increased consumption and heighten the probability of achieving the $800 per-capita-income target . In turn , this would involve cutting the planned industrial growth rate by an estimated 1 percent , with a resulting shortfall on the $1 trillion output target . <> <> Natural Growth Expected // Apart from providing the people with " more restaurants , tailors and so on , " the report said , the shift would make it easier for the country to reduce the unemployment that is expected to develop along its present path . The report notes that natural growth is expected to add about 10 million workers a year to the labor force , and says that still more jobs will have to be found for the tens of millions of farm workers that Peking intends to move off the land as agricultural productivity increases. // For Mr. Deng , any such shift away from the primary measure of economic growth that Communist nations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal debate that will be fostered by the report , conservatives seem likely to focus still more intensely on recommendations for increased use of market forces and decentralization that would have the effect of taking the country further down the road toward a Western economic model. // The report pays special attention to the need for more rational pricing , a process that has already begun with the shift away from administered food prices toward levels set in the market . Among the benefits the report envisages would be an improvement in the wasteful patterns of energy use , particularly of coal , that have developed under the subsidized pricing system used by the Communists since 1949 . About 75 percent of all energy used in China is provided by coal. // The report says that Mr. Deng ' s encouragement of foreign investment - over $700 million from the United States - " also seems wise , " though less for the capital and technology it attracts than for " the demonstration effect of modern management techniques . " As with other experts , the World Bank economists seem skeptical about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noting that economic growth usually has been associated more with a rise in general technological levels than with isolated spurts . <> <> Industry Examined // In a lengthy examination of Chinese industry , the report comes down strongly on the side of an elaboration of the profit motive , and also of wider freedoms for managers of state and collective enterprises . In particular , it suggests that they be given greater authority to set manning levels , and to hire and discharge workers . Perhaps most controversial , it suggests that such enterprises eventually be freed from the responsibilities they now have for furnishing housing , education and health services. // The expansion of private enterprise is also urged . At present , the vast majority of the 10 million private businesses in China employ one or two people , and are concentrated in the service sector , but the report says that allowing private ownership of " medium-sized " enterprises could be an important force . Apparently aware of the political resistance this idea could engender , the report suggest that provision be made for a compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reach " a certain size.
