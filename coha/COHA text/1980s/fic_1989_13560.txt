Monday evening . BENI 'S APARTMENT . Sounds of lovemaking . Two figures , Beni and Paul , IN SILLHOUETTE in bed intertwined in various sexual positions . ITALIAN POP MUSIC plays softly throughout scene . BENI I like it better this way , being on top . I have n't had it good in a long time , almost 16 hours , and I 've been waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting Beni mounts him and pulls his hair back , biting his neck . BENI Potresti amarmi . Mio dio , ti trovo bello . PAUL Oh no . BENI You speak it , do n't you ? PAUL Italian . BENI Do you speak it ? Potresti amarmi . PAUL No . ( Then slowly , but surprisingly fluent ) Potresti amarmi . Your skin is so smooth , your body is mio dio ti trovo bella . Potresti amarmi . They are suddenly still , studying each other as the Italian music continues to play . Then Beni begins to move again , rising to climax . HER CRY sustains into the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 SCENE TWO . COURTYARD . Early the next morning . It is very quiet , except for an occasional bird chirp . There is a bench , table with chairs and a trash can . Upstage stands a half-constructed low wall made of off-white bricks . Behind this is the entrance to Beni 's apartment , with an invisible wall revealing her bedroom . A figure is lying on a bench , newspapers over their head . The figure stirs and sits up . It is the WOMAN , who stares straight ahead , seemingly at nothing . SAM ENTERS with backpack and sits at table . He looks about briefly , noticing her , then pulls out a book and begins to study . He looks up , the Woman breaks her focus and looks at Sam . He gives her a quick , polite nod of the head , a definitely Japanese acknowledgement . Woman nods back , but slowly . SAM Ohiyo gozaimasu . WOMAN does not respond . SAM Sorry . Nihon'go e hanashimasu ka ? WOMAN gives a slight turn of her lips , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM ( Gives up and begins to read Japanese characters , first silently , then out loud to himself , with an excellent command of pronunciation ) a , i , u , e , o ka , ki , ku , ke , . ko . Sa , shi , su , se , so . Ta , chi , tsu ( stops , writing the characters as he speaks ) Su , Shi . Sushi , Suuuu-shiiiii . Saaaa-shiii-mi. ( pause ) Sashimi . As Sam continues out loud , Beni 's DOOR OPENS and PAUL COMES OUT and GOES into his own apartment , which is next door . A few seconds later , BENI COMES OUT of her apartment , stops , focuses her eyes to the morning light , looks up at the the sky and then out at the courtyard . SHE GOES back into her place . We can see into her living room , which also serves as a bedroom . She opens her closet , pulls out a piece of lace fabric from a box , tacks it up to the downstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OUT into the courtyard , begins mixing cement and preparing to lay bricks . p. 4 SAM ( Continuing ) Ko i . Koi , Fish . ( Pause ) Ko i . Su ki . Yu ki . Yuki . Oh , hi there . Ohayo gozaimasu . Am I in your way ? BENI Oh . No , you 're fine . SAM Ogenki desu ka ? Genki , I hope . ( No response ) Ogenki desu ka ? BENI Very genki . SAM Watakushi wa --  BENI Are n't you the guy who moved in next --  SAM Oh . Gomen.  - -  Japanese class with Yamashiro sensei ? I thought uh , well , sorry . Anyway , that 's why I kept asking you  --  BENI No , Human Sex . SAM Gomen ? BENI That Human Sexuality that 's where I 've seen you before . Last year . SAM Ohoh , that 's right , your paper wasonuhFoo-kool ? BENI Foucault . Yours was on China SAM The sexual revolution in China . Did you like it ? p. 5 BENI Yeah . SAM Yours was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked itdialectic sexuality , right ? BENI Did you think it was interesting ? Thanks . I 'm into that area . SAM You mean human sex . BENI No . Things like Foucault , and some Italian writers SAM Really , Italian . What , uhyou 're Japanese right ? I mean , you already --  BENI I 'm learning Italian out of this book . SAM  --  I mean , nihon'go . BENI Oh , do I speak it ? WOMAN examines trash barrel , begins marking the trash barrel with colored chalk . Beni and Sam watch her for a moment . SAM A female graffiti artist , that 's something , neh ? BENI It 's something new she 's been doing . They watch as WOMAN suddenly CLUTCHES at her chest , she is breathing and wheezing for air for a moment no one knows exactly what to do . Then she revives , goes back to marking the barrei. p. 6 SAM So , why not Japanese ? BENI I 'm going to Italy . SAM Really ? Ah , so desu ne . But Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're into oriental --  SAM  - -  Gomen : Asian . BENI girls ? Right . SAM I prefer Asian girls , if that 's what you 're saying , because they speak to my Asian side . I 'm one quarter Japanese . I 'm also part French and Czech . BENI You 're part J-A ? SAM Hai . Now , you still have some of the culture , right ? SHE pours some water , stirs cement , begins BUILDING the wall . SAM ( Continuing ) I 'm better at language of the Orient , I 'm not sure why . Probably because I am part of those cultures , so it makes some sense . Brentwood Samuel desu , anata wa ? ( He extends his hand , but BENI is working on the wall . ) BENI ( Attempting to answer his question ) Oh , it 's 8:05 , I got ta get this stuff done before the manager gets here , I was supposed to have done this last month . p. 7 SAM No , does n't that mean , " What 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , uh ( extends her cement covered hand and shakes ) Beni . SAM Beni , as in Goodman . BENI No , and not as in Benny Hill , either . SAM Funny , you do n't look like a " Beni " . Beni-chan . Hmm . BENI Like Sting or Madonna or Fellini or Lucifer . Beni . Beni . Has a nice round but sharp sound . SAM You look more like , well BENI I found this word which means property . SAM Property BENI In Italian . SAM Hmmm BENI Or ownership . Property or ownership . SAM Well , it 's an interesting one . I notice there 's lots of people taking on these names , mostly girls , some sort of emancipation thing . I like emancipation thing , especially for Asian girls , it 's very bold of them to change their names like that so they can really break that stereotypical mold , and stand up and be their own self , and still be intelligent and still limber and sexy , just like Madonna . I am impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite like a Beni , moreLike a France . France Nuyen , South Pacific , remember ? p. 8 BENI I 'm not too familiar --  SAM You know ( sings ) : " Some enchanted evening/you will meet a stranger " . I heard you playing this music from your apartment -- not that I was spying or anything , but you know I just moved in . Your music adds nice ambiance , and your singing , it sounded really good --  BENI Oh , that . Thanks . SAM  - -  sounded , kinda , is it that new Japanese dance music ? BENI Umberto Tozzi . He 's real popular in Italy . I mean , he was , you know , early 1970s stuff . He was the glamor of Europe , he even wrote his own songs . Started out as a skinny teenager with a bush of hair and a gap in his front teeth , and he sang himself glamorous . This is definitely not Japanese . SAM ( Continuing ) It 's kind of my interest , especially my Japanese heritage right now . It fascinates me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . HE opens a folder and pulls out a neatly folded piece of paper . SAM Do you mind ? BENI No . SAM I mean , it 's kinda boring to some people . p. 9 BENI No , go ahead . SAM ( Translating ) " There 's a red a blue lantern by her window where she works/she walked by me this morning and the rainfalling from the rain gutterturned into a festival of colors . " See , it looks hard , with the hiragana and kanji mixed in together , but Yuki-chan , she 's a friend of mine , an exchange student , she 's been helping me with it . ( Pause ) I know : Phoebe Cates , that 's who you remind me of . BENI Do n't be so stupid . SAM Gomen . Slow and steady DRUMMING begins , coming from Paul 's apartment . His rhythm simple and a little hesitant , but not without spirit . The woman gets up and begins dancing , slowly , to the beat . PAUL COMES OUT into the court yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by a strap running diagonally over his back and shoulder . SAM ( Over drumming ) Is that guy Japanese-Japanese , or half and half , or American Born Japanese ? BENI Who , him ? He 's everything . Japanese and Chinese . PAUL ends the rhythm with a distinct ending beat . He lets out a loud victory yell . SAM An " ABJC " . An " American Born Japanese Chinese . " p. 10 BENI That sounded nice , Paul . ( Introducing ) Sam , this is Paul . Paul , Sam . SAM and PAUL shake hands , Paul leading them into an extended , Black handshake . PAUL Hey , what 's up ? SAM Very impressive . Are you one of those Robert Bly drummers ? Gee , I thought that was a White thing . PAUL I 'm drumming myself into a more spiritual state . Well , yeah , practicing . SAM I 've heard of that . PAUL Really ? SAM Some people use meditation , some yoga , you drum . ( Silence ) PAUL Yeah . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how bout that . ( To BENI ) I was going to tell you , I 'm going to Japan in the summer , and staying for exchange in the fall . PAUL You two just meet ? BENI He was studying here . SAM So , if you decide against going to Europe --  PAUL Europe ? BENI Soon . p. 11 PAUL Europe . Well , go to see Germany when you 're there . I hear there 's a lot of African American drummers in Germany , making the big time . SAM Beni BENI Maybe . First I 'm going to Italy . PAUL Man , Beni , is this one of your fantasies --  BENI I see Italy as colors . Many colors , and people with dark eyes and dark hair , and the women wear jewelry , lots of jewelry , on their fingers and necks . And the people in Europe stare . PAUL Yes , the do . BENI I like that . Because their not afraid to show that they are looking at you . Because they are interested in what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want something . BENI A good lay , I could consider that . But mostly , Italy is like a Big World . It has centers , it has history , and the people stare . And there 's lots of food . A cornucopia , just like in the Roman days . Food . Sex . Orgies . SAM Oh , gomen . PAUL Baby . BENI Just like Fellini 's Satyricon. p. 12 SAM Italy looks like a Fellini film ? BENI Well , not exactly like one of his films , but in a secret way , everything is Big and everything smells like something . People have scents . SAM Because they do n't shower . This is how the Japanese are very different from the Europeans . PAUL Everything 's big . BENI Big , everything 's Big . PAUL ( Grabs his crotch ) Guess I 'm not exactly 8-1/2 , baby . BENI I 'm talking Big in a full way . ( She gestures melodramatically an Italian gesture ) And in a romantic way . I 'd love to meet the people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to get there by boats . And just as the sun begins to set , the houses begin to look lavender . Better than the sunsets here , that 's for sure . I 've seen pictures where people have these dark green venetian blinds in their windows and their homes are lavender . They have better color sensibilities over there . And Rome , of course --  SAM I hear Nara has famouse sunsets . PAUL Rome . Is n't that where the Pope is ? Man , it 's bad enough he has my name . p. 13 SAM and deer . Nara has a deer park . BENI Who ? PAUL Pope John Paul . Jesus Christ , I 'm stayin ' away from that place . Now , if I were going to Europe , I 'd see Amsterdam . Free living there , you know what I mean ? ( He beats a few times on his drum ) SAM I 've really enjoyed your music . PAUL ( Flattered ) I was n't really trying to play for anyone , but SAM I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL Yeah , you know , getting rid of some bad churches I 've sat in , men in suits , et cetera . Needs a little Rasta spirit . SAM Well , we all go through our Black phase . PAUL People do n't go through phases , man , more like revolutions . SAM I mean , Beni 's in her European phase . BENI Hey , wait , you 're in your Japan phase , Einstein . SAM But this is not a passing thing . It 's part of my heritage , our heritage . I 'm only part Japanese , but I feel , well , very akin to this part of me . Sometimes I feel I 'm full Nihon-jin , just born into the wrong body . p. 14 BENI Well , everyone has something they want to have come out . SAM But this is my blood . Black and Italian , well The WOMAN has made a PAPER AIRPLANE , meticulously folded , out of paper from the trash . She hands it to BENI . BENI Gracci . I 'd forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move downstage . They sit on the ground , The WOMAN showing BENI how to fold another airplane . SAM Well , nice meeting youPaulas in Simon ? PAUL Quinto . SAM Oh . Quinto PAUL  - -  Spanish for " fifth . " My grandfather lived in Peru . SAM You 're part Peruvian ? PAUL Nah , he was Chinese . SAM But someone was Peruvian . PAUL Our last name meant " fifth " in Chinese ( he draws an invisible Chinese ideograph on his palm ) , so he changed it to " fifth " in Spanish . SAM Do Chinese do that ? PAUL Change their names ? p. 15 SAM No , name themselves " fifth " . Would n't you rather be first , or grand or king ? But then , maybe it 's a sign of humility , to name yourselves fifth . PAUL ( Laughing ) It 's fifth , I do n't give a fuck why my grandfather chose it . SAM Really . Chinese-Japanese from Peru . Very ethnic . You 're a student . PAUL ( Insulted ) No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PAUL I 'm a teacher . Kindergarten teacher . SAM Really ? PAUL ( Pulling out a joint ) Yeah . It 's a living . Substitute . Good hours , good pay . Nice kids . SAM Kids are wonderful . I 'll probably be teaching in Japan , English you know . There 's a lot of Japanese that want to learn it . Businessmen and O.L.'s --  office ladies , you know -- and students . They are such quick learners too , very bright , I hear and , well , they study the writing and reading English all the time but their pronunciation is , well , cute . PAUL gives a short laugh . SAM I will probably settle in a town outside of Osaka , a smaller village , get to know the people , and teach privately , maybe to O.L.s who have plans to go to Tokyo or America . p. 16 PAUL You 're kidding right . SAM No , pleanty of O.L.s want to come to America . PAUL ( Takes a hit . Silence . ) You want some , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL Really . You need it . Too uptight . Relax . Time out , work is over . Man , you 're like Beni , intense . SAM Are you two , well , of course you two are , uh PAUL I just know her . Well , we do n't " date " if that 's what you 're asking . Neighbors SAM I did n't mean to pry . PAUL we 've never " gone out " , but I 've " been " with her . ( Takes a hit ) Neighborly . SAM Oh . You 've " been " with her . PAUL Yeah , you know I see her aroundand things . She just got out of something . SAM Oh , yeah , that guy used to come with her to Human Sex class , that skinny White guy , Dana , Danasomething . PAUL Yeah . ( Studying Sam 's appearance ) Dana Carlander. p. 17 SAM I 'm part French , Czech , Cantonese , and part Japanese . PAUL Hey , man , OK , OK . WOMAN throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . BENI EXITS to retrieve it . SAM I 'm not a White boy . PAUL I did n't say you were . You do look White . SAM I 'm not . PAUL offers joint to the WOMAN , who takes it , drops it on the ground and STOMPS it out . PAUL Christ . A simple no thank you would do . ( To SAM ) Yesterday she took it . Smoked it . ( To WOMAN ) But then you started wheezing , OK , you got a point . SAM Well , nice meeting you , Paul . SAM EXITS . PAUL puts down his DRUM and salvages the joint , lights it again . HE watches the WOMAN examine the drum . He offers her a hit again . SHE takes it and hits . PAUL Ah hah . We do have the same destructive habits . ( Long pause ) So . Seen any good films recently ? Uhwant some coffee , I was gon na make some coffee . Cohee oquieres una taza de cafe ? No . OK . PAUL EXITS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to drum , examines it . Then she takes out a large stick of red chalk and begins to DRAW on the ground in long , sweeping motions . BENI and SAM RE-ENTER with more bricks . p. 18 BENI This is going to take forever . THEY WATCH the WOMAN as she DRAWS . BENI begins to set bricks . PAUL Looks like Korean . BENI How can you tell ? PAUL Look at all the o 's and lines . SAM No , that 's kanji . PAUL Nah , look , her lines barely connect . SAM It is kanji . WOMAN WHEEZES . THEY Watch . WOMAN RECOVERS . SAM Asthma ? BENI Some sort of breathing problem . PAUL continues to smoke . BENI begins to wipe the Woman 's markings with a cloth . SAM and PAUL watch . WOMAN draws as BENI follows her , ERASING . SAM Do you think you 'll go this summer , Beni ? BENI I 'm going . Someplace Big . I 'm leaving soon . BENI EXITS . PAUL She always says she 's leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like a Phoebe Cates to you ? END SCENE . p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE . BENI alone . BENI Sometimes , after he goes , I splash my face with water and look in the mirror . I am relieved that I have done it , once again , and that now I am relaxed.I go to the mountains occasionally , usually by myself , and watch the sky , the clouds and the air rush around . Birds flying , like friends of mine , in upward spirals . Toward heaven . I envy them , because they are of the sky and I am of this earth . BENI I went to this bookstore once and picked up a book from the Super Saver section . It 's called The Book of Questions . Asks you all about life . For example : " You are climbing a tall cliff , your partner below , who is connected to you by a rope , slips and is dangling . Your partner has no knife and asks you to cut the rope , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . What do you do ? Then there 's the one that asks : " If you knew that not having sex for a year would give you a better sense of peace , would you do it ? " ( She considers this ) Certainly not . I may be obsessed , but I 'm not stupid . In the COURTYARD the WOMAN sits , very still on the ground , breathing in and out , in and out . She holds her hand to her chest , then moves her hands up her face , touching cheeks , jaw , eyelids , her forehead , continuing her steady breathing . END SCENE . p. 20 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR . That evening . BENI 'S APARTMENT . BENI and PAUL are in bed , another heated session . They finish . LIGHTS RISE . BENI is still for a while , then gets up , goes to the window . SHE lights some INCENSE . BENI You mind ? PAUL Uhno . Is that to make me feel more at home ? BENI What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back memories . BENI This one 's patchouli  --  PAUL You know , back in the 70 's , when everyone was burning incense , we did n't just do it for effect , it was to cover up the smell of pot . BENI ( overlapping )  - -  pot . Yeah , yeah , everyone did drugs , OK . I like the smell of patchouli . I like to watch the smoke as the sun sets . She looks out the window and sticks the incense in a nearby plant pot , lets it continue burning . BENI Potresti amarmi . PAUL Italian . BENI You speak it ? p. 21 PAUL Potresti amarmi . BENI You sound wonderful when you speak it . Do you speak it ? PAUL No , you 've asked me that before . Do you know enough to get by ? BENI I thinkyeah , I do . ( Recites ) Dov'e la finestra ? La finestra e dietro la lampada . Do you know we 've known each other for two years ? PAUL Off and on . BENI What . PAUL This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who does n't want a co-mit-ment . BENI You should talk . Besides , how can I have a commitment when you live next door to me ? ( Pause ) Why do you do it so much ? PAUL ( Pause ) Same as anyone . I just like it . BENI The mirror , why do you like it , the mirror ? PAUL Because your reflection is like a film . Better than a film . To see us there , my sweat and your sweat , my arm around your neck , fucking . BENI It 's like someone there , is that it ? PAUL Besides you and me ? p. 22 BENI Someone watching . PAUL I 'd like to fuck you in public , you know that , so that they can see you and me , and be awstruck . ( He laughs ) Because they would least expect it . BENI From me or you ? PAUL Both of us . BENI Why ? PAUL You know why . He stands her in front of an invisible mirror as they face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over your breasts , you touching my cock , rub the balls , my sweat over you . They would see it . White voyeurs can only watch , they can not have . They can not have me . They can not have you . Look , we are not to be touched . They learn something new today , there is something they can not have , our sex . ( Caresses her ) BENI Is it the sex that counts ? PAUL Everything is sex . We 're humans . BENI I wonder why we 're like this . ( Caresses him ) I think I 'm nympho . PAUL It 's fine with me , baby . BENI No , I 'm serious . ( Pause ) A man I met in the supermarket line , well , actually , I did n't want to meet him , but he just started talking to me . He said he thought " Oriental girls are so beautiful , not like the plain White women he dated . " Then he says " Well , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , the ones that are sexually perverse or highly sexed . " I want him to see me fucking . And then I do n't . Because he 'd say , " I knew you 'd be kinky . " Probably get a hard on in his brain . p. 23 PAUL We 're the experiment of our race . The big test . Me and you . Erotica , baby . BENI And we end all this --  PAUL When the race is so married out there are none of us left . BENI I want to date White men again . PAUL ( Stops ) Like who ? BENI Just in general . PAUL Not your neighbor . Right ? Not him . BENI No , in general , White men , in general . I want to and then I feel this utter guilt . It 's worse than religion , this guilt . I 'm feeling guilty sleeping outside my race . All those Asian men that wo n't get a lay if I 'm fucking a White man . PAUL Oh , spare me . BENI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause ) What has happened to our race . I just want to help them all . PAUL That 's some hand you 're giving them . BENI I know . I try . PAUL Well , baby , the world is large and I will not stop you at your front gate . Italy is pretty large . p. 24 BENI Big . Italy is Big . PAUL I know it 's hard for you to stop . ( Gets more comfortable in bed . ) BENI I am a sexual being . I miss you when I 'm at work , I miss you and walk down the halls I want tosometimes I 'm just sitting there , I get swelled up inside , and my heart -- my pussy -- wants to leap out . I walk down the halls and I search you out in my mind , I want to fuck you . But you not there so I want to tear at the walls , and shoot with large M16 guns , is n't that odd ? So that I can have you . BENI I hold you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry out . You come in me because you can not control yourself , because I drive you to me . Who could resist you , what a body , what cunning and eyes like demons . Like a lion . Like a dragon , a gargoyle . PAUL does not respond . She reaches for her Italian book , reads . BENI Dov'e il libro ? Il libro e sul tavolo . Dov'e la lampada . La lampada e dietro il tavolo . Paul ? Paul . PAUL has drifted off . She goes to the window , pulls the lace fabric to one side , like a drape . SHE looks up a number in the phone book , picks up the phone , DIALS . BENI I 'd like to purchase a ticket to Italy . Uh , what city do people fly in to ? Fine . From LAX . Coach . Uh , as soon as possibleoh , really ? GoodFridayOK . How much isOh , reallyuh ( She looks around her apartment and at Paul sleeping ) Can it be open ended , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . ( Long pause ) I 'll take it . Yes . She reaches over and turns on the tape player on . ITALIAN MUSIC , a disco ballad by Umberto Tozzi plays softly . The LIGHTS FADE on Beni 's apartment and RISE on COURTYARD where the WOMAN is sitting , DRAWING something on the pavement . She draws with red and black pastel chalks , in wide , swirling motions . We see a silhouette of BENI writing on a pad of paper and hanging up the phone . The MUSIC FADES out and the sound of HEAVY NIGHT WINDS fill the stage . The WOMAN stands back and admires her work , then senses she is being watched , turns . BENI and the WOMAN look at each other in the darkness . Lights fade . p. 25 p. 26 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE . SAM Sex maniacs . I live in between two sex maniacs . They pass my window at night and go to his or hers and groan and laugh and yell , thump about . ( He imitates their sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he groans ) It 's not fair . END SCENE . p. 27 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX . The next morning . SAM sits , examining the Kanji on the ground . PAUL leaves BENI 'S apartment , SAM nods a Japanese hello and PAUL nods nonchalantly and GOES into his place . WOMAN enters courtyard , sits at her bench . SAM nods hello . WOMAN nods and then lays down on bench , putting newspapers over her head . BENI COMES OUT of her apartment . Throughout the scene she continues to BUILD the wall in the courtyard , until it is finished and waist high . SAM Beni-chan . Ohayo . BENI Hey . SAM I figured out what that one is ( pointing to ground ) . The one right there , that looks like the letter " t " with a noodle tail and a speck on the right side ? BENI Yeah SAM That 's the hiragana " o " . BENI ( Pause , expecting more . ) That 's it ? SAM Well , she has such a flowery way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all I could pick out . It 's a connector word . As in nani o shimasu ka . ( Pause ) You still leaving next week , or were you kidding ? p. 28 BENI Of course , why would I be kidding . SAM Well , I heard that you say that a lot . BENI What ? SAM That you 're going to go , but then do n't . How long ? BENI I do n't know yet . Who told you I say that ? SAM Paul . So , I 'm curious why you chose that place . BENI Well , like I said , I have an interest . And this guy I knew , he went there for a year , worked as a dish washer , listened to people speak and caught onhe could speak it fluently after a while . SAM Is he helping you learn Italian ? BENI He 's in Germany . He married and they moved there . He does n't speak German either , but he learns quickly . He 's the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . Tozzi was famous in Italy when he was there . SAM Really ? BENI Dana fell in love with a woman when he was there . Italy is very sensuous . SAM And sexist , neh . I heard from this Italian woman that sometimes the men pull out their genitals and flash you , right there when no one else is looking . p. 29 BENI Dana was such a free person . SAM Wait , Dana . You mean that guy who used to come to Human Sex with you ? BENI Yeah . So ? SAM Nothing . BENI What ? SAM He 's White . BENI Yeah , so . SAM He influenced you to go to Italy ? BENI He sparked me to consider it . SAM A White guy got you into his White country . BENI Dana is n't Italian . He's -- who knows -- some ex-Catholic from Ojai . SAM Just as bad . I 've been thinking about all this race relation stuff , because I 'm dating more seriously now . I have to be choosey . I mean , I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls -- like Janis Cho . She became more than a friend -- that 's over now -- but when we were together , we used to go out , just to go out , to see a movie or have some ice cream , whatever , neh ? BENI Sounds nice . SAM I tell her I was going to Japan on exchange , and she 's really happy for me , which is unusual . p. 30 BENI Because women --  SAM  - -  because she 's Korean . You know most Koreans do n't feel at ease with the Japanese because of the War and all . But Janis has never had a problem with me being part Japanese and all , and she thought it was great I was going to Japan to learn about my heritage . BENI Do you speak Korean ? SAM A little . I tried this phrase on her : Janis , sarang heh . It means " I love you . " She said my pronunciation was pretty good for an American . BENI Sam , no offense , but you only date Japanese , Korean  --  SAM Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something very understanding about Asian girls . There 's a lot that 's understood , unspoken between us , I think because we share similar heritages . God , Haku-jin girls ca n't appreciate anything . They want you to drive them here and thereIt 's true . This haku-jin girl I was kind of seeing -- see , I did try dating White women -- we had been going out for about a month , neh , and she wants me to buy her jewelry , not zirconians , but the real stuff , with diamonds . BENI Maybe you 're just going out with the wrong haku-jin women . I never had that problem with White women . p. 31 SAM You 're not dating them . Gomenhere 's the other thing . Sure , OK , I look White , just as Caucasian as the next dude , but I 've always beensee , IlookI get carded whenever I go to Albertsons to buy a lottery ticket , even though I 'm way over eighteen . Do I look at least eighteen ? BENI Sure . SAM OK . So call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it , but some of these White guys , they size me up , which is n't very hard , me looking --  BENI Younger  --  SAM as if I should n't even be buying lottery tickets , and they blow me off . The White women blow me off too , for the same reason . Excuse me for existing . I mean , I 'm a mixture , so I 'm gon na look a little different . Shorter , different build . You know , Janis never asked for diamonds or said I was somehowless a person . BENI And then you went to bed with her . SAM Yeah , but first we were friends . BENI Sure . SAM Hey , sex happens . Come on , you 're not exactly celibate . BENI So . SAM What happened with Dana ? p. 32 BENI Nothing happened , I got preoccupied with other men , and he got married . SAM Just drifted away , so desu neh . BENI Yeah . ( Pause ) OK . So there 's this bad rumor that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't insinuate  --  BENI I suppose there 's been a few . SAM I was n't asking BENI  --  five . SAM Since when . BENI Recently . SAM Since Paul ? BENI No . If it 's any of your business , he was after the five . SAM Well , you 've been busy , have n't you ? BENI It 's been four months since Dana got married in Germany . All I get is this postcard of a Bavarian meadow with this blue sky and a house off to one side , like he 's supposed to live there or something . Not like I was pining away , not like I waste time over it . Most people say , " How fortunate " , but to lie on your back 365 nights with someone always sleeping with you , that 's not fortunate . p. 33 SAM Does n't sound bad . BENI No one tells you to be lonely . They tell you having more than one is lucky . SAM How do you have time to study ? BENI I 'm not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BENI Sleep ? SAM No , no , to BENI Work ? SAM No , do other things ? BENI What other things ? SAM Otherthings , fun things . BENI Things you do when you 're alone ? That 's why I got ta get out of this place . I figure , if I am lonely for a while I can find lots of things to talk about . I know that sounds simple , but I want to have something , like reading a novel -- I do n't know how you have the patience to read novels -- or writing or stamp collecting , anything , then , upon meeting a complete stranger , out of sheer loneliness , I could whip out a sturdy parchment folder and say , " See ? Here , I got ta show you this new stamp from India from 1932 , it cost me three hundred twenty dollars and fifty cents and it 's never been cancelled . " It 's that easy to be desperate . Like I said , no one tells you to be lonely . Now Italy , Amalfi p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's for sure . Beni-chan , I was n't too sure if I should mention this , but I talked to this Italian woman . I asked her about that singer you like , Umberto Tozzi . BENI Does she like him ? SAM I asked her if she liked him , and she laughed . Said he was a disco version of Julio Iglesias . BENI Oh . Yeah , so maybe someday it 'll be classic . SAM Disco ? She said Tozzi was popular all over Europe except in Italy . BENI Dana said he heard him on the radio every day he was there in the kitchen washing dishes . SAM I know that 's not the entire reason you 're going there  --  BENI It 's not why I 'm going there at all . SAM  --  but , I just thought you would like to know about Tozzi . Beni , Italy is not you . BENI Maybe . I never said it was me . SAM You 're Japanese , or of Japanese lineage , there is nothing Italian there . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , but Beni-chan , you 've side-stepped something important . p. 35 BENI I never thought of it like that . SAM Our culture is important , it 's too Eurocentric here . I study German psych. , Italian poetry . They wo n't even let me take Japanese to satisfy my foreign language requirement . BENI ( Stacks bricks intensely ) Look , it 's not like I go around with my hair in a bun , bowing and shit  --  SAM No , but , there is such refinement in Japanese ritual , you know that . BENI Maybe . I do n't do tea ceremonies . SAM Beni . Look at me . ( BENI stops and looks directly at SAM ) I 'm serious . This is not just a passing thing . Now when you put aside all the really bad moviesJapanese women do n't follow ten paces behind anymore . No , they make you walk ten paces behind them , neh ( Laughs ) When you get all that stuff out of the way , think of the actual purity of -- good example -- the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . SAM Do n't laugh . Yuki-chan and I did one once . She showed me how , it was very , well , pure , meditative . Now , I know your set to go to Italy , but maybe before you do , you should explore a little of your own heritage , just to say you have it . p. 36 BENI Maybe . SAM ' Come on . You know , you may not be travelling for a while after this trip . What if you never travel again ? Do n't you want to know you least walked the same towns , look up and see the same weather , the same rain and sunshine and clouds that your great grandparents saw BENI Maybe SAM The country side , the Meji-Shrine , is archaic , but it 's in your blood BENI Well SAM You know what 's so ironic , Beni-chan ? You keep saying " maybe " to these Japanese things , and it 's actually your Japanese-ness that 's making you hesitate so much . BENI Maybe . How do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment they watch the WOMAN drawing as she kneels on the ground . SAM EXITS , BENI is left watching the Woman . Then the WOMAN turns and hands a piece of RED CHALK to BENI , who takes it . THEY KNEEL together on the ground and DRAW Kanji , BENI following the woman 's figures . BENI TURNS UPSTAGE , and continues to draw on the ground . SAM RE-ENTERS with a beautiful , colorful YUKATA ( a cotton-style kimono ) which he drapes on Beni 's shoulders . She stops . SAM RE-EXITS . BENI STANDS , and facing UPSTAGE , puts her arms in the sleeves of the yukata , ties it and pulls her hair up into a loose bun . WOMAN EXITS . BENI TURNS DOWNSTAGE , and smoothing the front of the kimono below her knees , she sits , Japanese-style . SAM RE-APPEARS again near edge of courtyard , holding some small papers in his hand . p. 37 BENI So , how does it look ? SAM Beniyou still have time to change your flight . BENI How does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is beautiful . SAM Ustukushii desu . Sound of CHIMES blowing delicately in a breeze as lights fade . END SCENE . p. 38 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN . COURTYARD . Thursday evening . A figure is lying on bench , newspapers covering most of their body . PAUL , still dressed in his teaching clothes , comes out with drum , sits on the low wall . The wall and ground are covered in red and black markings . He begins to DRUM . The figure on bench stirs and sits up . It is BENI . She is disheveled and dirty . She has red and black paint and chalk on her clothes . She picks up an open beer can next to the bench . PAUL Jesus Christ . BENI That 's right , where is that fella when you need him ? PAUL What the fuck are you doing ? BENI Hello there . What time is it ? PAUL Do n't you have to pack for tomorrow ? BENI Oh ? Oh , that . I 'm all done . Hm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six-twenty . How long have you been out here ? BENI Let 's see ( counts on fingers ) since last night . PAUL Shit . BENI GOES into her APARTMENT and exits to wash up in the bathroom , JUST OFF-STAGE . PAUL SITS in her front room and lights up a joint . p. 39 BENI ( Off-stage ) I just wanted to seeeee you . I need it badly . ( Peeks head around entrance , looking about ) It 's dark . PAUL That 's the way it gets at night . BENI ( Off-stage ) Went out for Mongolian barbecue with Sam . PAUL Uh , huh . Sure , that explains it . BENI The place was kind of fake anyway . No chopsticks . BENI RE-ENTERS , sits on bed . BENI But maybe Mongolians do n't use chopsticks . Then I went home . PAUL ( Reaching for Beni 's beer ) I thought you said you did n't drink . BENI I 've been abstaining . Then when I do drink , I have a wonderful time ! I 'm celebrating my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a whole day , what 's up ? ( Offers joint to her ) BENI ( Declines ) An absolutely devastating , twenty-four hours . PAUL How could you miss me with that guy following you around speaking **25;1058;TOOLONG . He 's " part Japanese " , do n't you know . Wimp of a White boy . ( Laughs ) p. 40 BENI And no we did n't . We 're platonic . PAUL I 'm not asking . You seemed pretty interested in his Ohayo 's anyway . ( Imitates Sam ) Ohayo , Ohayo gozaimasu , Beni-chan . BENI ( Singing ) Ohayo gozaimasu , irrasshai mase , do itashimashitedo n't touch the mustache . PAUL God , we aughta get you like this more often . BENI I can get like this on my own , thank you . I do n't need you to help me . But I do need you for companionship . Because I found ( leans closer , whispers ) it 's no fun to drink alone . I was all packed and I put everything in storage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun went down and everything got kind of grey and silky and the lights went on all over the complex , and I drank four cans  --  PAUL Four beers ? You drank four ? Shit . BENI See , yesterday me and that Woman ate together . We ate out of the trash can . Kind of sick , but delicious . Mmmmparts of hot dogs and orange juice concentrate . Then we took the bus downtown and drew all over the walls , just like the real graffiti artists . ( Takes a drink ) Graffiti -- how Italian . Then I came back and drank , and then she drank , then I drank , and soon they were all gone . And I fell asleep in the courtyard and had this weird dream about this guy . p. 41 PAUL ( Getting high ) OK . Who was it in the dream . BENI Oh , I du n no . He was like you or me -- except it was n't you , no offense , but I never dream about people I know . I mean he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth skin . He said , " Hold me . Could you love mepotresti amarmipotresti amarmi . " He looked regal , but erotic , like a dragon gargoyle . PAUL What the fuck are you talking about , a gargle ? BENI Gargoyle , like a dragon gargoyle . He said abbracciami PAUL ( Suddenly fluent ) Abbracciami . Ti deveo abbracciare . Il tuo bacio e come una soffice careza sulle mie guance e lingua BENI Yeah , just like that . Do you speak Italian ? PAUL ( Frustrated ) I do n't speak Italian . You 've asked me that several times now , baby . BENI Oh . PAUL Anyway , that 's kinky , Beni . Beni meets the Gargoyle . You ever realize you named yourself after a drug ? BENI My name means " property and ownership "  --  p. 42 PAUL  --  in Italian . But it 's also what you buy on the corner . So , what 's your real name . BENI None of your business , as you know . Something boring anyway , like Chrissy or Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Reading her passport ) Patsy Jean Yamada . Patsy ? BENI Patsy . PAUL ( Picks up a book on the table ) Well , do n't feel bad , my middle name 's worse than all yours put together . BENI There is nothing worse than my name . PAUL Rex . BENI ( Laughs ) Sorry . Rex ? PAUL Means " King " in Latin . ( Reading ) Michel Foucault . The History of Sexuality . Leisure reading material ? BENI " Rex " ? ( Laughing ) PAUL ( Points to sticker on binding of book ) A " used " sex text I see . Baby . And highlighted , even . ( Reads ) " Sex put into discourse " . Hmmm . BENI Give me that . p. 43 PAUL But sex with who ? Sex with Rex . That rhymes , but is it logical ? BENI Of course not . PAUL But Sam . I thought you 'd aim higher . BENI He 's just curious about me . PAUL ( The pot taking effect on him , he laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beni , how could you , the women's-libber-feminist whatever the hell you call yourself , go out with someone like Sam . Do n't you get it ? Yellow fever . Do I have to explain ? BENI Ah , yes , more Anjin-san , come to your little Cherry Blossom , ah , oh . PAUL Do n't disgust me . You playing along is just a little fake . BENI Everything is fake to some degree . PAUL Yeah , well , some things are more fake than others . BENI So . What 's real ? PAUL Like music , man . Percussion and real rock . Not these ballads and Air Supply shit . BENI Do n't make fun of him . PAUL Who , Sam ? BENI Umberto . p. 44 PAUL Who ? BENI Tozzi . PAUL No , I was talking about Air Supply . They 're worse than Tozzi . I mean , a real band gives youpower , real spirit , like Reuben Blades , and the old Chicago . BENI You do n't even listen to music . PAUL My tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , that 's always the best way . BENI It 's been busted since I first met you . You 've never even tried my music . PAUL now they go way back to junior high with Chicago and the Stones and Boston and Van Halen , the old line up of Van Halen . Near summertime , eighth grade . That 's when you find reality , in junior high , every summer after summer . Music is only fake if you do n't know the summer that it played in Beni . ( Takes a hit ) Some people just do n't understand . BENI You never even tried Umberto Tozzi . PAUL Are you paying attention ? PAUL takes her beer can away and DRINKS . BENI Hey . PAUL This is n't beer . Water ? You 're drinking water ? ( Laughing ) What did you have , four cans of water ? How can you get  --  you 're not even buzzed . You'rewhat are you on ? If you 're not hightalk about fakers. p. 45 BENI Do I have to be drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL Stop acting drunk , you 're not . BENI Who said I was ? PAUL Why do n't you just be normal ? BENI Because , that 's exactly what they 're expecting me to do . PAUL Shit . BENI I like that : " Sheeit , Fuck " . How do I sound ? Shit mother-fuckin ' , goddamn fuckin ' asshole  --  PAUL Immature . You're -- girls are disgusting when they 're drunk , even when they 're only acting drunk ! BENI He called me a girl . You called me girl . You said you never called girls girls , you called girls women . Hypocrite . PAUL Fuck , you kinda scared me , Beni . BENI It sounds better when guys swear . I wish I was a guy . " Beni " . A packaged androgynous name . Nice and round but sharp at the same time . So I could be more like a guy . Is n't that funny ? I always wanted to be one , get to play music , play baseball until it was too dark outside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped right past me . Junior high . I do n't even remember junior high . Except I could n't read very fast . The summers were long and hot and boring , and I could n't wait for school to start , and then school started and it was long and hot and boring , and then it was summer . That was my junior high . No one told me to go out and buy records and comic books . Where was I all that time ? p. 46 PAUL Hey . Look , you want to go outget a drink or something ? BENI I hate the smell of beer . But look what happens when you want to act drunk ? What is so disgusting ? If you do n't mind , even if you do mind , I 'd like to indulge for a while . ( Drinks from can of water ) I lied . After Mongolian barbecue we went to my place and hada tea ceremony . He said he was studying Japanese customs and he wanted to try it with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell not ? He brought in the large bowls and wooden whisk and the green foamy tea . And we wore these kimonoyukata thing-ies . SHE opens her closet pulls out the YUKATA . She PUTS IT ON . PAUL laughs . BENI What ? It 's just a hobby , all these Asian things he 's into and I really admire people who put their heart and soul and time into things . It was serenevery pure , really . And he said he wanted to capture that serene ritual , so he took some Polaroids of me , pouring tea , like this . Then I saw those pictures of me and I thoughtI look reallyJapanese . PAUL You do look very Japanese . ( Pause ) You look nice . HE hesitates , then kisses her neck , moving down her body . PAUL Let me just --  p. 47 BENI No , it feels PAUL How does it feel ( he kisses her breast ) . BENI No , it ( uh , she cringes away in nausea ) No , it feels PAUL Let me touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead place . No . ( Nausea ) Do n't touch me . PAUL I 'm not . Beni . Honey . Beni . BENI runs offstage to bathroom . She VOMITS . Sound of running water offstage . BENI returns , wiping her mouth , sits quietly on floor . PAUL You OK ? Maybe too much today . BENI Stay over there . I ca n't think when you touch me . Stop . Stop . Do n't touch me . PAUL Beni , I 'm here . I 'm over here . BENI Stop touching me . PAUL Beni ? BENI When I was little I used to fall asleep with the light on and stare at the ceiling , count the animals in the plaster , the ones made out of curls of plaster , with eyes and fluffy heads . Buy when we made it yesterday , I was staring at the ceiling and I do n't see them any more . They 're not in the ceiling any more . p. 48 PAUL What do you see ? BENI There 's nothing . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no gargoyles . ( She looks around the room , trying to subdue the nausea ) Every day I see this place and every day we see each other . It 's been years . PAUL Nine months . BENI Years . You know it , years . PAUL No , it 's been nine months . BENI It 's been years for me , you know it . Stop it . Stop coming here . Stop touching me . This ceiling does n't stop , does it , it just goes on and on forever , all the animals have blended in , that 's why I ca n't see them any more . They 're camouflaged in something creamy and white . ( She stares at the ceiling ) . You know , the first time I did this was when I was a freshman in high school . In the back of a field , when vacation just started , with a boy my age , with the grass running up all around us . We were the center of a golden field . When we finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . I had my pants off and the wind blew right up my legs , inside myright inside me . It was so good then.How do these things get like this ? Sex flows just like water , on a long stream , longer than the Amazon , turns ever so slowly , never reaches the sea , never stops to rest , just moves slowly , keeps me wanting one more heavy , deep round , one more , slowly . ( She has trouble getting up , she sits again ) Come and fuck me . ( She holds out her hand , PAUL is motionless ) Make love to me , then . ( He does n't move ) Make love to me . While I still am young , raving and hot . ( She feels pain followed by nausea . Laughs ) How things are different now . The sky is white , look , look the sky is white , creamy and white . Animals lost in the cum shot . p. 49 PAUL Beni , why are you really going ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the sex I am going . BENI looks out window , sees WOMAN kneeling on ground , touching her face , neck and chest as she breaths in and out slowly . p. 50 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT . PAUL alone on stage , in half-light . PAUL begins to count in Cantonese , then in Swahili . BENI enters . She speaks in Italian , then English . SAM comes in the background , counting in Japanese . WOMAN writes in kanji and then stands up behind Beni , as if she is her shadow . PAUL **40;1085;TOOLONG BENI Potresti amarmi . Mio dio ti trovaobella . Potresti amarmi . Three hundred sixty days , going on one year . Is it joy , being with a man ? SAM ichinisanshi gorokushichi hachi kujuu BENI I ca n't see the light any more , look for an answer .

WOMAN , SAM and BENI stay in COURTYARD from previous scene . SAM continues his Japanese , studying out of his book . SAM tsutsetsorariru BENI enters and immediately goes to WOMAN , gives her a brown bag . SAM Beni-chan ! Ohayo . ( No response ) I was just starting to work on formal and informal greetings . BENI That 's nice . SAM Did you know that if I 'm female I say ( points to himself ) " Watakushi wa " and if I 'm male , which , of course , I am , I say " Boku wa " . But if you 're very formal , I suppose --  BENI Sam , could you just cool it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper front of her . SAM If you 're interested , there 's a special round trip deal in and out of Narita Airport for $630 . BENI I 'm going to Europe . SAM I thought you had made a change of heart the other day . p. 53 BENI You were mistaken . SAM Murata-ken , is n't that where you wanted to go ? ( Pulls out a map of Japan ) BENI You just happen to carry that with you ? SAM Beni-chan , you forget , I 'm going , too . BENI When ? SAM Well , soon , for exchange . I 've been thinking of changing my plans a little , leaving before the summer BENI When ? SAM Soon . BENI You catching a special round trip deal to Narita ?

You only wanted to get the right direction , someone to help you make a decision , and then , wow , the next thing I know I 'm looking at this beautiful girl in front of me all dressedtraditional styleI 've never seen you like that before , that 's all I 'm saying . BENI I changed my mind . SAM So that did n't mean anything ? It 's because you 're modern , is that it ? ( Pause ) You are a tease --  BENI Hey , I delivered . You 're confusing a tease with a one night stand . SAM I wish you would n't talk like that . BENI That 's the way I talk . SAM It 's very unbecoming . BENI Excuse me , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace fabric off the window and replaces it with the yukata , tacking it so that it hangs like a curtain , blocking her from view . She TEARS at the YUKATA with a knife , tearing it vertically into dangling colorful strips . SAM Beni-chan . Beni ! PAUL , hearing commotion , COMES OUT of his apartment , stands with Sam outside Beni 's window . p. 55 BENI ( Tearing ) This is not real . SAM What are you doing . Stop it . It 's very real . It 's from from the finest district in Tokyo . SAM tries the door , BENI locks it , PAUL shrugs . PAUL I told her she looked nice in it . BENI ( To Sam ) You wear it . SAM No . BENI Why not ? SAM Because it 's a girl 's , and plus I gave it to you . BENI Wear it . SAM No . Stop ripping --  BENI Why do n't you wear what you think is cute . SAM Fuck you , Beni . BENI You lousy Jap .

You 're not even --  PAUL Jesus Christ , you move fast . BENI ( To Sam ) You 're a liar . A liar . ( Laughs ) You 're a fuckin ' White boy . SAM If you 're insinuating I 'm not part Japanese --  BENI I 'm telling you . SAM I 'm just as ethnic as you and you know it . And I know more about the culture than could ever fit in that small mind of yours with your Italian disco star playing the same songs over and over , gyrating about Europe and Fellini visions andandsex coming out your ears . Talk about screwing . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAUL That 's enough , man . End it all , right here . BENI You fake .

BENI ( To Sam ) Fuck you . Fuck your kimono , White boy . ( Rips again ) SAM It 's a yukata and I am one-quarter Japanese . My mother 's mother is from Japan , you got it ?

END SCENE . p. 59 Act 1 , Scene 11 SCENE ELEVEN . The next morning . Friday . PAUL sits alone in courtyard . The ground , walls and trash barrel are covered with red and black markings , mostly Kanji . The courtyard is deserted except for a FIGURE laying on the bench , newspapers over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small Japanese dictionary , trying to decipher the Kanji . SAM You know , she really flipped . PAUL A little upset . SAM It was a gift , an omiyage , she could 've just given it back . No need to destroy things . PAUL An over reaction . SAM Does she overreact much ? PAUL She was just upset with the situation . SAM She looked fine in it . It 's just a yukata . I was n't trying to make her my geishawakarimasen , Beni-chan . PAUL Well , she 's going . She sure knows how to go out with a bang . SAM I 'd say . ( Pause ) You do n't feel that way , do you , about Nippon ? PAUL Seems to me it 's not the country that 's the problem . p. 60 SAM She hates her heritage , that 's obvious . PAUL You still part Japanese ? SAM Of course I am . Why should n't I be . What do you mean by that ? PAUL Never mind , man . WOMAN enters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalks . SAM Kon'nichi wa . BENI comes out of her apartment , carrying a small backpack . BENI Could you take care of this , just tell them Ileft . I 'm already a month late as it is . You can have it ( motioning with her head toward the apartment ) the tape player . PAUL Thanks . BENI I 'll send you a post cardor something . PAUL Sounds good . ( Awkward silence ) I just wanted to tell you , because I wo n't see youfor a whileIhope you have a good trip . Kyoo sukite .

BENI ENTERS COURTYARD , SAM and BENI see each other . Beat . SAM EXITS . BENI approaches WOMAN who is drawing on sidewalk . BENI I 'll write to you , send you post cards with pictures of the country and blue skies with clouds . WOMAN points to a cloud . BENI Yeah . I 'd travel hundreds of miles just to see clouds like those.Utsukushii desu neh ? p. 62 SHE reaches out and touches the WOMAN 's face tentatively . The WOMAN moves closer , watching BENI and kisses her . They pull back quickly . PAUL turns on the MUSIC in Beni 's apartment , a ballad by Umberto Tozzi PLAYS into next scene . p. 63 Act 1 , Scene 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to A MANNEQUIN woman sitting next to her . Music fades to almost inaudible , as if it is background music on the plane . The airplane is bright and stylized , FELLINI-ESQUE . BENI Enjoying the flight ? this is my first time on a plane , no really , never been on one . I ca n't wait until we 're there . No , I 'm not Japanese , I 'm Japanese American , the difference iswell , never mindwe 're very different from them . We 're less inhibited , very sensual . I 'm just saying we are very sensual people . But we do n't need to flash our pussy and cock around , either . ( Sighs ) Well , this is going to be a good trip for me , I 'm traveling all around Italy , by myself , with this ( pulls out an instamatic camera ) which is not a stereotype , but because I want to carry it . There 's a difference , you know. I feel so free . Relaxed . ( Looks out window ) Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're so still , almost like they 've never been touched by a human hand . They are so perfect . Round but kind of sharp at the same time . ( Looking about ) It 's just the way I thought it would be . The people are just like Fellini filmed it . Now there 's a great Italian . Not like that joke of a singer , what 's his name , Tozzi ? ( Laughs ) Now Fellini , you know his work , right ? ( Pause ) You do n't know the great director of your country ? ( Pause ) Oh , good . He likes everything Big . Almost to excess . I know Italy does n't look like a real Fellini film , but I know that right under the surface , despite Catholicism and all , the Italians love to stare and they are colorful , and they have a perfect human passionate smell . I 've been reading up on these things . I suppose I could of gone to Japan , because that 's , you know , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go somewhere Big . I 've always felt that it 's whatever you make of a trip . Would n't you say ? ( Mannequin does not respond ) You know , you 're not very talkative . I kind of like that . I have a neighbor back home like that . It 's nice to have someone listen to me for a change . ( Sighs with content ) So , what is it you say you do , to pass the time ? p. 64 THE BACKGROUND becomes a BRILLIANT BLUE , MUSIC PLAYS . PAUL leans out of BENI 's WINDOW , the YUKATA TATTERS FLOWING around him . In COURTYARD WOMAN is kneeling , DRAWING with her red chalk , covering the ground in large sweeping Kanji . The WOMAN stops and LOOKS UP from her work . PAUL LOOKS UP with her . The shadows of SWIFTLY MOVING CLOUDS travel over the woman 's face and body . PAUL GOES deeper in to the apartment , away from view . Sound of PLANE ENGINES roaring and fading away followed by the sound of HEAVY WINDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Beni 's window . FADE TO BLACK .
