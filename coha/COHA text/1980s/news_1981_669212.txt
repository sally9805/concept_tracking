" But in the Cabinet itself . . . things are still shaking out . Roles are still being drawn . The crunch hasn ' t come. " // After nearly two months in office , the President ' s command structure is still forming . His Cabinet and staff are still probing for the limits of their own authority and power . But so far , observers say , there have been no nasty breaks in the amicable , " collegial " Reagan operation. // Some early test of authority and power seems inevitable to White House observers . It could come over any issue , they say . A potential decision crunch could over the question of Japanese auto import quotas . Cabinet members already have lined up publicly against each other on this issue , which is headed for White House review again this week. // Or it could manifest itself in a veto decision , should the administration take an adamant position in dealing with any congressional ambivalence toward Reagan ' s economic plan. // For the moment , the inner workings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cabinet secretaries say they are " keeping in touch " and the policy discussions are " enjoyably frank. " // The stellar performance of budget chief David A. Stockman has helped the Reagan administration ' s entire effort to date , some Cabinet members say . " They think they ' re in 10 times better shape than if they did not have Stockman , " a Cabinet insider says. // The Cabinet split over auto import curbs has been " blown out of proportion " as a test between free traders ( Stockman and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan ) and more politically pragmatic members ( Transportation Secretary Andrew L. ( Drew ) Lewis and Commerce Secretary Malcomb Bladrige ) , some Reagan staffers contend. // However , to respected outsiders such as former Federal Reserve chairman Arthur F. Burns , the issue is crucial . Yielding to Detroit ' s pressures for imports would impair the credibility of Reagan ' s determination to stick with his program until inflation yields , Mr. Burns says. // The early Cabinet consensus has held up remarkably well , but strains are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their " constituents " filters up. // " We ' re hearing not so much that the consensus is breaking up , but that there is some dispute over the priorities which to emphasize in the public arena , " says White House scholar Stephen Wayne. // " The early Reagan team effort required everybody to talk the same language and root for the same captain , " Wayne says . " Reagan took on people who had at least an initial consensus on both the budget cuts and tax cuts . As other issues come to the fore , that consensus will surely wane. " // One White House insider says the Cabinet and White House staff operations have handled successfully a number of issues that " held the potential for deep division , " such as foreign aid and tobacco subsidy cuts. // But the lines of power have yet to be clearly drawn , observers agree . White House chief of staff James Baker senior has played an " honest broker " role well  --  that is , avoiding skewing the views he represents to the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must express his own view as chief White House political adviser to the President. // And Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. has greatly strengthened his hand for a broader role with the President by accepting longtime Reagan confidante William Clark as his second in command. // " What showed Haig ' s class was his taking Clark without a whimper , " another longtime Reagan supporter says . " Clark was a superb chief of staff for Reagan in California . He made decisions . Already Clark is very impressed with Haig . Haig will make Clark his man and have an ear to the President. " // None of the White House threesome closest to the President  --  Mr. Baker , counselor Edwin Meese , and special aide Michael Deaver  --  has yet been fully tested , observers say . Mr. Meese as head of policy development is criticized for losing sight of issues in his " bottomless suitcase " and for failure to brief the President adequately for hid Canada foray  --  a replay of complaints early in the Reagan campaign. // And the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far has been hard to detect. // " Deaver doesn ' t get the credit he deserves , " says a one Reagan aide who has worked with the Californian for years . " He ' s remarkably perceptive politically . And he isn ' t afraid to tell the President he ' s wrong. " // The Reagan White House decision process has been very " unstructured compared with other administration , " says a Washington Republican presidential strategist close to the administration . " Often you can get a clearer picture this early , after a new president is elected , of what the power structure is around him. // " It ' s been loose , really , so it ' s hard to tell how things are getting done and who ' s contributing to what. // " It can be assumed that a critical issue will arise and , whatever it is , you will be able to see how other interests play off agaisnt it . This will likely come before summer. // " So far the Cabinet meetings have been rather collegial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is controversy , it seems they put it off and talk about it some more. // " What ' s happening is that Haig and Lewis and the others are asserting their powers . Lewis , for example , with the auto imports matter has taken a risk . In internal politics , if he ' s not somewhat successful on it then he ' ll suffer from it . If he pushes basically what he wants through , he ' ll be very strong. // " That ' s how he ' s chosen to meet this situation  --  to take something that ' s got to be decided and stake out a position on it before he ' s told what to do  --  and see if can ' t ram it through. " // The White House power structure still is not really settled , observers agree . " They have a situation now that doesn ' t resolve anything , " one Reaganite says . " That ' ll clear up one way or another . You can ' t have a permanent discussion. " // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
