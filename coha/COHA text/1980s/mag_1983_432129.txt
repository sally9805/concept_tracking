 | These days Michael Smuin , codirector of the San Francisco Ballet , can chuckle about the time the company opened an elaborate new production of " Cinderella " in 1973 to an audience of 200 . Or about the financial crisis of 1974 , when things got so bad he entered a tricycle race ( one of the other competitors was a chimpanzee ) and the dancers performed on street corners , in department-store windows and even with live animals at a wildlife park in order to attract attention , raise money and keep the San Francisco Ballet alive . The company not only survived ; it has blossomed into a troupe with a national profile . It 's the third largest dance company in the country ( after the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theatre ) . Two of its fulllength works , Smuin 's " Romeo and Juliet " and " The Tempest , " have been televised nationwide . Its impressive new $10.5 million headquarters will be ready before the end of the year . Retrospective : This is the San Franciscans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in the United States . To celebrate , they recently staged a gala historical retrospective in their own honor . Imaginatively conceived by Smuin and presented by Gene Kelly and Janet Reed , it recalled , through film sequences and dance excerpts , the company 's beginnings as a branch of the San Francisco Opera and its long association with the remarkable trio of Christensen brothers , starting with Willam , who became director in 1938 ( Lew Christensen is codirector today ) . Then , immediately getting back to business as usual , the San Franciscans plunged into their new season with a characteristically varied program ? two works by major choreographers ( George Balanchine and Jiri Kylian ) as well as offerings by the company 's own Smuin and Val Caniparoli . The evening got off to a strong start with an American premiere by Kylian , the artistic director of the Netherlands Dance Theater , whose excitingly visceral choreography often has dancers hurtling through space at breakneck speed . His relatively subdued " Forgotten Land , " set to Benjamin Britten 's beautiful " Sinfonia da Requiem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind and sea . The curtain rises ; 12 dancers are grouped at the front of the stage . their backs to the audience , facing Joh : McFarland 's simple backdrop of a coastlin : and the sea and horizon stretching beyond it . They walk toward the rear of the stage Suddenly , a woman dancer jumps , as if is fright , into a man 's arms ? and the musih starts . Kylian repeatedly brings his six couples together and then separates them . evoking the timeless rhythms of nature and : the sea . The musicians gave Britten 's bi orchestral score a stirring performance , an the dancers dug into Kylian 's stacca : movements and gestures of grief with e ' . - pressiveness and conviction . Flying Dive : Surprisingly , the compan failed to infuse " Western Symphony , " Ba : - anchine 's classical-ballet vision of cowboy and saloon girls , with its usual vigor . But 17 was right on target in Smuin 's 1982 " Stravinsky Piano Pieces , " the first of the t ? works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Stravinsky , the win : , good-humored suite of dances includes among others , a " Tango " spoof , dance. : with panache by Paula Tracy , John McFall . Anita Paciotti and Attila Ficzere ; " Balalaika , " a giddy Russian trio that ends with the woman taking a flying dive into the wingand ? we hope ? somebody 's arms ; and a " Ragtime " tap duet , expertly executed by Evelyn Cisneros and Kirk Peterson Throughout , an onstage piano is an integral part of the ballet ; dancers lean against it while watching one another and even join the pianist for duets . Tony Walton 's paneled mirror at the rear of the stage both reflects the colorful choreography and doubles at times as a window looking out on a starry night . The high point of the work is the " Serenata " ( from " Pulcinella " ) , a comic tour de force for a ballerina and her six adoring admirers , in which they maneuver her every which way as they carry her around . In the best moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll next to one another on the floor . " Chansons de Sheherazade , " a world premiere by 31-year-old dancer and resident choreographer Val Caniparoli , presented perhaps an impossible challenge Ravel 's delicately oriental settings of Tristan Klingsor 's poems do not lend themselves readily to dance . Using a musical work with specific texts , and then not interpreting those texts , sets up expotations that are not met . What 's more , moving a singer around the stage , as Caniparoli does , is distracting . Still , Tracy-Kai Maier gave a striking performance as the seductress ; every one of her sharply etched movements and come-hither looks was aimed at enticing the two men in the ballet Caniparoli turns the second song , " La Flute Enchantee , " into a male pas de deux with homosexual overtones . Like the work as @#  | a whole , however , it promises more than it delivers . Both Lew Christensen and Smuin take particular pride in the San Francisco Ballet 's development of choreographers . " They support you tremendously , " says dancer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company for more than 10 years and who recently choreographed two works for ABT . " If you flop , they turn around and say , What 's your next idea ? ' It 's the kind of commitment that will make dance happen down the road . " Says Smuin : " In terms of the future , the San Francisco Ballet is probably the most important company in the country because of its creativity . We do more new ballets , commission more new music and have a larger variety of designers than any other company . " Flair : Such boundless enthusiasm is typical of Smuin , 44 , who has played a major role in the San Francisco Ballet 's incredible comeback . He originally joined the company in the late 1950s . Like many other San Francisco dancers , however , he left ? in 1962 ? to seek greener pastures . He danced on Broadway and TV and in a cabaret act with his wife , Paula Tracy . Eventually he joined ABT . In 1973 , as Christensen , 73 , recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a lift with his new energy and punch . " " I always knew I would come back , " says Smuin , who became hooked on ballet as a young boy when the Ballet Russe came through Missoula , Mont. , his hometown . " In New York I prepared myself by working with every major choreographer in the business , studying at the Art Students League , going to concerts and the theater . I was a big human sponge . " How well he learned his lessons is evident in his theatrical flair and his ability to grab an audience 's attention ( he has choreographed more than 25 works for the San Francisco Ballet alone ) . Today San Francisco no longer worries about talented dancers like Smuin defecting . " The conditions we offer ? more employment than any other company , new ballets , major ballets by major choreographers ? make San Francisco a very appetizing place to stay , " says Smuin . The audience averages about 85 percent of capacity in the War Memorial Opera House . Since 1975 the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has a roster of 44 dancers , including among the many standouts Ricardo Bustamante , Paul Russell , Laurie Cowden , Tomm Ruud and Dennis Marshall . And it can look forward to its handsome , superbly equipped new rehearsal , office and school building , just across the street from the opera house . This structure , boasts the company 's administrative whiz , Richard LeBlond Jr. , will be the first in the United States specifically constructed for a ballet organization . It looks as if Michael Smuin 's tricycle-riding days are over for good .
