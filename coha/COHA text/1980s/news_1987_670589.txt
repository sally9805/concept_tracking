The newsletter , he said , is devoted to " wines that improve with age , " mainly red Bordeaux . It is not surprising that its contents - market analyses accompanied by charts , graphs and computer-based tables - resemble those in newspaper financial pages . Professor Ashenfelter specializes in econometrics , the application of statistics to economic problems. // A traditional view of the stock market holds that it provides the ultimate gauge of the value of a company . Professor Ashenfelter views public auctions of wines much the same way . The prices fetched at them , he wrote in the first issue of Liquid Assets in the fall of 1986 , " represent the single best objective source of information on the quality of fine wines . " The reason , he said , is that auctions disinterestedly reflect the prices determined in " transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers. " // Most consumer-oriented wine newsletters , journals and magazines recommend wines for drinking today and in coming years , and for possible resale at auction , on the basis of tasting notes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing and harvest conditions . But Professor Ashenfelter , a wine fancier since 1978 , said he considered that approach " too smoky for wines that require bottle aging . " He said he preferred " rationality " - that is , looking not at adjectives but at statistics. // Do you want to know which old Bordeaux and California reds merit investment ? Forget wordy wine catalogues , he said , and instead examine his lists of prices at public auctions in London , Geneva , Amsterdam , Chicago and San Francisco. // Are you wondering about buying futures ? ( After superior vintages , futures customers pay in advance for wine that will be delivered 18 to 24 months later . They hope the price they pay will wind up being substantially below the market price when the wine arrives . ) Professor Ashenfelter said the worst guidance for risking hundreds , if not thousands , of dollars on wine that may turn out to be disappointing is the " propaganda " purveyed by wine critics who have tasted raw , embryonic Bordeaux ( and Napa Valley ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying new issues that come on the stock market , " he said . " Each year the Bordelais undertake a worldwide campaign to launch a new vintage in the marketplace . You need accurate information to buy , but the last person you ask is the issuer - the proprietor . He needs the money . Would he criticize his own children ? " // So where does the futures customer find the most trustworthy information on Bordeaux wines ? Not in " sensory evaluation , " Professor Ashenfelter said , but in the long-term temperature and rainfall data that a Liquid Assets associate collects from public records at Merignac Airport in Graves , near the city of Bordeaux . The data correlate fairly predictably with vintage quality , he said. // " It is no secret that hot , dry summers are the key to a high-quality red Bordeaux vintage , " Professor Ashenfelter wrote in the first issue. // His analysis went on : " Between 1952 and 1985 the median August-September rainfall was 126. 5 millimeters . The median July-August temperature was 19. 4 degrees ( centigrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth and above-median rainfall were 1954 , 1956 , 1958 , 1960 , 1963 , 1965 , 1968 and 1972 . These vintages sell at auction infrequently , but when they are sold it is typically at very , very low prices. " // Using the temperature and rainfall data for the ' 86 Bordeaux vintage , he projected that the wines would be " not as good as the 1973 ' s , " which " do not often sell at auction anymore. " // He denounced opening offerings of $500 to $600 for ' 86 futures as " outrageous " and counseled subscribers to shun them as if they were overpriced new issues on the Big Board . By the same token , he said , the fine 83 ' s , now on the market , remain underpriced. // Liquid Assets ( 169 Nassau Street , Princeton , N.J. 08542 ) comes out twice a year . It has a paid circulation of 200 , which is no comment on its quality since , after all , fine Champagne comes in splits . Professor Ashenfelter , in confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American , British and French wine worlds. // The newsletter ' s Chicago correspondent is Prof. Robert Lalonde , who is on leave as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago ' s graduate school of business . His task is to collect the Bordeaux weather data . He does other things , too , such as being a senior staff economist on President Reagan ' s Council of Economic Advisers. // The third issue , to be mailed early in December , will feature Sauternes , the first white wine to be analyzed by Liquid Assets . So far , red Burgundies have been excluded , Professor Ashenfelter said , " because of the complexity of vineyard and grower information required - the same reason many people don ' t buy them . " German wines have not been discussed for the same reason. // A highlight of the first two issues was tabular comparisons of retail prices in Manhattan and auction prices in London , where some of the world ' s most sophisticated wine merchants trade . They showed eye-opening bargains in Manhattan in prized Bordeaux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too. // The publication reported last spring , for example , that a case of ' 78 Chateau Petrus , a Pomerol , cost $1 , 200 at Goldstar Wines and Spirits , in Forest Hills , Queens . In London , where eight cases were sold , the hammer price ( excluding the buyer ' s 10 percent premium ) averaged $1 , 668. // Professor Ashenfelter said this disparity , and others like it that can be found in Liquid Assets statistics , might well inspire some high-rolling arbitraging ( buying wine on one market and selling it on another ) . Moreover , a wine lover seeking a maximum long-term return on money yanked out of Wall Street might be lured by his finding that " Petrus in any vintage typically sells for a minimum of twice , and often triple " the price of Chateau Lafite. // Professor Ashenfelter said he preferred investing in wine for drinking pleasure , not for profit-taking . If profit-taking is a consumer ' s chief interest , he said in an interview , " Anybody who holds a new wine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up . " He went on , " If you hold it for 10 years , you ' ll get a nice return. " // Until 1978 Professor Ashenfelter , a native Californian , knew only " a little " about wine . " I drank Valpolicella , " he said . His ascent began when a friend who collected wine gave him a ' 67 Margaux ( he no longer remembers the estate ) . " I never realized wine could be like that - and it was not even a very good vintage , " he said. // Liquid Assets is a part-time venture . Professor Ashenfelter and some colleagues , still defining its content and style , are ironing out kinks in the presentation of data and purging some economese in the prose. // What was the history of its birth ? " Since I ' m a professor , I don ' t have much money , " he said . " I started buying young wine in 1979 and I did not want to depend on the advice of wine writers . So I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Finally I realized I was spending more money on the data than on the wine . I thought I found something useful , and wanted to share the cost of the data - and the message - with others. " //
