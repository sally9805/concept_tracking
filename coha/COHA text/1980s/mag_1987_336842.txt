To those in the fray , it must be disconcerting to have Mario Cuomo on the sidelines doing his little fan dance : flirting , then playing coy , teasing , acting shy , then showing a bit more thigh . At the very least , it distracts attention and diminishes the stature of those on the field . But none of the declared candidates dare complain as they troop to the New York Governor 's issues forums and hope for his blessing . " We need the presence of the most articulate spokesman for our party out on the hustings , " Senator Paul Simon graciously declared at one of the forums last week . And when rumors began circulating that Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk had asked Cuomo to issue a Shermanesque disclaimer saying he would not accept a draft , both men scurried to deny the stories . <P> So what is the party 's most celebrated cerebral orator up to ? His strategy actually seems wondrously simple : 1 ) enjoy himself immensely , 2 ) make no move that would give the lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely , 4 ) take every opportunity to remind people that he is thinking big thoughts , 5 ) enjoy himself immensely , and 6 ) wait and see . And what of the complaints that his bursts of interviews and speeches tend to cast a large shadow over the field ? Proclaimed Cuomo earnestly last week : " It is important to make the case for the Democratic agenda in addition to making the case for individual candidates . " These are not the words of a man who intends to sit back meekly and restrict his thoughts to the pages of his journal . <P> The conventional wisdom , born out of the past four campaigns , is that a candidate must organize early to gain momentum in the early primaries , which will winnow an unwieldy field before producing a clear winner . Cuomo publicly endorses that wisdom with a passion . But as well as enjoying his situation immensely , he seems to be preparing the ground , just in case , for a possible change in the way things work . Privately , he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered a noted campaign consultant a staff job ( he declined ) . Publicly , he has seemed to cool on Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis , who presents the greatest obstacle to a Cuomo draft . Instead , he has said sweet things about Simon , who despite his current chic among old-time liberals seems less likely to sew up the nomination . Sometimes when talking about Simon , however , Cuomo seems to conjure up the image of a politician closer to home : " He is an idea person , a person who thinks , writes , studies , who is profound in his conception of things . " <P> Cuomo has made a firm declaration that he will not enter any of the primaries , but in an interview with NBC 's Tom Brokaw he again refused to rule out his accepting a draft . It adds up to a no-lose strategy . If Iowa and New Hampshire produce no great victors , and if Jesse Jackson emerges from Super Tuesday 's Southern primaries with the largest bloc of delegates , the Democrats could find themselves in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , a slate of delegates in California or elsewhere , either uncommitted or formerly pledged to a sinking candidacy , might declare themselves as Cuomo surrogates . Even without that , Cuomo could emerge in the preconvention brokering if the primary process fractures with no acceptable front runner .
