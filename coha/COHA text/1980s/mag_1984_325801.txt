New Ms. in Ole Miss <P> On Jan. 6,1920 , Governor Theodore G. Bilbo urged the Mississippi legislature to ratify the 19th Amendment to the Constitution , giving women the right to vote . Departing from his usual bilious bigotry , Bilbo requested " recognition to the intelligence , sweetness , character , ability and worth of the fair womanhood of Mississippi . " But the legislators , reluctant to enfranchise black women also , voted no . <P> Last week , by a unanimous senate vote , Mississippi became the final state to ratify the 19th Amendment . The action came a mere 64 years after it became the law of the land . When State Senator Howard Dyer called the resolution up for a vote , he rivaled the condescending chivalry of Bilbo . The measure , drawled Dyer , was drafted by " some lady legislators who take great pride in the fact that they are authors . "
