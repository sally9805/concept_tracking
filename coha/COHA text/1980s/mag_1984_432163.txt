 | The Operation That Saved My Husband 's Life Thank God he 's out of danger , I thought . Then I learned the real danger had just begun . It was clear and sunny on the morning of my thirty-fourth birthday ? Saturday , June 25 , 1983 . Five months pregnant with our second child , I sat outside a hospital room while inside the room the doctors were deciding whether my 49-year-old husband , John Y. Brown , Jr. , governor of Kentucky , needed immediate open-heart surgery . That same night , instead of enjoying the quiet birthday party John and I had planned with our three-year-old son . Lincoln Tyler Brown , and a few relatives and friends at the governor 's mansion in Frankfort , I was still waiting anxiously ? praying , hoping , and praying some more ? while the surgical team performed the triple-bypass surgery doctors had decided my husband needed to aid his failing heart arteries . Past midnight , when the operation was pronounced a success , I tiptoed in to see John for a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good color , all I could say was , " Thank God . thank God . " It was a good birthday after all . I did n't know that John 's or-  | deal ? and mine ? had just begun ... . I first met John in early January 1979 . A dynamic , powerful man , founder and former chairman of Kentucky Fried Chicken and one of the country 's most successful businessmen , he had already soId his interest in the fast-food chain , bought and sold a professional basketball team , and completed other business ventures . He was a man who worked hard , played hard and loved life . He had three teenage children from a former marriage . At the time we met , I was network television 's first female sportscaster , My show was ? and still is ? CBS-TV 's NFL Today . John had seen me on TV and told some friends , " That 's the kind of woman who appeals to me . " When we met at a championship play-off game , I had never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found him very attractive . So attractive that , only two months later , on St. Patrick 's Day 1979 , we were married by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale . It was while we were on our honeymoon on the Caribbean island of St. Martin that we began to figure out what we 'd do with the rest of our lives . Friends had suggested that he run for governor of Kentucky , and after we 'd discussed the possibilities . I said , " Why do n't you run for governor ? " his dad had run unsuccessfully for governor several times , and friends had urged John to make the race in 1979 . He had n't decided to , though , and the deadline for entering the primary was only days away . Now , however , John made up his mind . We cut short our honeymoon and flew back to Kentucky on primarydeadline day . We walked off the plane , and John announced he was running for governor . There were only weeks until the primary election and his opponents had been campaigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for their support , but all of them were already committed to other candidates . Or they said " John , it 's too late . " Determined , John and I hit the campaign trail . At first it looked impossible . But things started to turn around . John won the Democratic primary and had a landslide victory in November . In late December we moved into the governor 's mansion in Frankfort hoping to slow the hectic pace of the past months . I was pregnant with Lincoln , and we were both excited about the baby . Then one day the fire marshall inspected the mansion , pronounced it a fire hazard , and ordered us to move out . Suddenly we had no home . Fortunately , during the campaign , we had bought Cave Hill Place , a 160-year-old house in Lexington , Ky . It needed an enormous amount of work that we had  | intended to start " someday . " Now Cave Hill was whipped into shape in six weeks , and we lived there while I supervised the repair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %s e moved back to the mansion , the governor 's official residence . John and I are both overachievers , constantly on the go . I had my baby , returned to my TV job , and wrote a book , The I Love America Diet . John , in addition to his duties as governor , was chairman of the Democratic governors . We aveled to Europe several limes . And to celebrate the May 7 , 1983 , Kentucky Derby and the opening of the newly restored governor 's mansion , we gave a huge party for Vice-President and Mrs. George Bush , former President and Mrs. Carter , and others . After that we went to Florida for a couple of weeks to relax . John looked wonderful , but I think he knew something as not right . He 'd complained of chest pains before , and the doctor had given him an emergency supply of nitroglycerin tablets and told him to slow down . But John was still what he called a " professional health planner . " He planned all the time : Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking , slow down , start to jog , use his exercycle . Always tomorrow . In Florida John entered the Miami Heart Institute for four days of thorough checkups . No problem was found , but he was told to lose weight , stop smoking . and pace himself . The following week , back in Kentucky , he attended the quarterly meeting of the state 's cabinet secretaries and called me to say he was n't feeling well . I learned later that he had chest pains . But how could anything be wrong ? He 'd just been completely checked out . That belief kept me from worrying for the next week . To celebrate my June 25 birthday , my mother had flown in with my two-and-a-half year old niece , Brittany , my brother 's child ; and my dear friend , Carole Hoffman , had come from Dallas . We were planning a cookout . That Friday afternoon , June 24 , John came home and went upstairs to take a nap . The rest of us were in the activities room in the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with John , called me , " Mrs. Brown , the governor needs you upstairs . " " What 's wrong ? I asked . " I just gave him some nitroglycerin , " the trooper said . We 'd had a new elevator installed in the mansion , but I could n't get it to come down to the basement , so I flew up the stairs . Three troopers were with John ; an ambulance had been called . John was lying on the couch , holding his chest . " You 've got to be strong , Phyl , " he said . I held him , crying , and kept saying , " Are you okay ? I love you . " The ambulance arrived and the troopers managed to get the elevator working so they could take John down in a wheelchair . Knowing my mother would take care of the children , Carole and I rode in the ambulance with John to nearby King 's Daughters ' Memorial Hospital in Frankfort . Because John 's doctor was not immediately available , he was completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave John an electrocardiogram , and when it read normal , he wanted to go home . But Dr. Bustin , God love him , told John that he was going by helicopter to the Albert B. Chandler Medical Center at the University of Kentucky in Lexington , about 30 miles away . It was about 1:00 A.M. Saturday morning when we got there . John kept saying , " I feel fine , let me go home , " but we paid no attention to him .  | Later that morning the doctors decided to do a cardiac catheterization on John . They inserted a catheter in his groin and moved it through the blood vessels while watching its tip on an X-ray screen . When the tip entered the heart , they injected a dye so that they could take X-rays ( angiograms ) to see if there was any blockage in the arteries . They explained the entire procedure to me ? even drawing pictures on a blackboard . I felt very secure because I knew what was going to happen . I also felt secure because John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house that morning . When he heard the news he rushed to the hospital to help . Not being a family member , he could view the situation less emotionally than I could . He was a tower of strength . When the procedure was over , John said , " Hey , babes I got through that one . " But the test showed that John 's arteries were blocked to an alarming extent . Bypass surgery was unavoidable . Our first impulse was to get a famous surgeon to operate . But Dr. Edward Todd , a surgeon at the University of Kentucky who does 150 to 200 bypasses a year , instantly won our confidence , and we knew he was the one to operate . John , who loves to negotiate , said , " Doc , what 's the price difference between a double and a triple bypass ? " We knew John had made up his mind to go ahead . Dr. Todd wanted to do the operation that very night , and John said , " Okay , go for it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved confidently to all of us and called , " Stick around , everyone , I 'll be back soon . " By this time I 'd been on my feet for hours and hours , and the doctor sent me home . My mother , Lincoln , and ' Brittany had gone to stay at Cave Hill because it was closer to the hospital than was the mansion , and I joined them there . John 's 83-year-old father , his three children ? John Y. Brown III ( known as John John ) , 20 ; Sissie , 18 ; and Sandy , 17 ? as well as John 's sisters and other relatives and our minister , Dr. Wayne Dehoney of the Walnut Street Baptist Church in Louisville , arrived . Some of the staff came from the mansion to prepare a buffet dinner . Waiting was hard . I walked through John 's studylooked at his books , his pictures . It flashed through my mind ? only once ? what if . . . ? Then I told myself , " Phyllis , you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd called just before the operation started , to say , " We may have to do five bypasses . " That really frightened me . I did n't know it was possible to do more than three . After the first bypass one of the doctors called again . Then there was a long , long wait . Finally the doctors called to say the third bypass was done and that was all they were going to do . Dr. Todd asked me to come to the hospital in 45 minutes . By the time I got there , a crowd of about 70 friends , colleagues , and associates were waiting to hear what was happening . Dr. Todd announced that the operation was a success and everyone cheered . Before I went in to see John in the intensive-care unit the doctor warned me that my husband was on a respirafor and restrained to the bed , with a tube in his nose and tubes in his chest . " Do n't be frightened by the way he looks , " he said . I was n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful body under the covers , and I thought again , " Thank God , thank God . " The next morning , Sunday , John was wide awake . He could n't talk because of the tubes , but he gave me a big smile . By noon he wrote on a pad that he wanted phones in his room . Everyone was astonished by the speed of his recovery , but it was about what I would expect of John Brown . That night he was taken off the respirator . We figured John would be out of the hospital by Friday , July 1 . But on Monday , June 27 , he was having a hard time breathing . The doctors were concerned . That night after I got home the nurse called me and said the governor wanted me to come back to the hospital and to bring my birthday gift . I did n't know what she was talking about .  | When had John bought me a present ? The nurse said there was a package for me , wrapped and about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers ? a goofy gift because I was pregnant . I found the box , brought it to the ICU , and started opening it while John grinned from ear to ear . Inside the box w as a gorgeous pearl choker with a diamond clasp and an aquamarine pendant . I loved the gift and I loved his thoughtfulness , but most of all I was happy that he was alive and going to be fine . That was the best birthday present of all . But the breathing problem continued . On Tuesday morning they put him back on the respirator . That scared me , but I was assured this sometimes happens after surgery . I saw John Tuesday afternoon , then went back to Cave Hill . At 5:00 P.M. Dr. Todd phoned . As he started to speak , I heard some commotion , then Dr. Todd said , " Mrs. Brown , could I call you back ? " He did n't seem alarmed , so neither was I. Mother and I took Lincoln , John John , and his sisters out to get hamburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children . When we got back Dr. Todd was on the phone again . John John spoke to him and I heard him cry , " My God , what 's happened ? Is my dad alive ? " Forcing myself to be calm , I took the phone . Dr. Todd explained that while he was talking to me earlier , John woke from a nap and , even though there were two nurses with him , broke his restraints and started to get up , pulling out the arterial lines from his left hand . It took five people to hold him . I had been warned that heart patients on a respirator sometimes have the sensation that they are not able to breathe . Not surprisingly , they react violently as they struggle for air . That was what happened to John , but he struggled so fiercely that his left lung partly collapsed . He turned blue . Dr. Todd immediately ( within 15 seconds ) ordered Pavulon , a drug that completely relaxes the muscles . Normally one shot immobilizes the patient , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quiet him . The doctor then made two small incisions through his chest wall and inserted two tubes to drain fluid out of the lung cavity . I learned that if he had not taken this emergency measure ? if Dr. Todd had not been right in the room ready for instant action ? John might have developed further complications that could have led to his death . And on top of this , during his struggle his blood pressure went off the machine ? over 300 . I rushed to the hospital . John 's room Has filled with doctors . They explained that John had Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome , known as ARDS . It is a rare , life-threatening complication caused by shock or trauma , in which the lungs fill up with a cloudy fluid . To treat it and allow his lungs to slowly  | clear , John was kept completely immobilized with Pavulon for seven days . In addition , he was treated by a procedure called PEEPS ? Positive End Expiratory Pressure ? a technique where a machine pumps pressure into the lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a very slow recovery process ; you must be patient . All that terrible week while John was lying immobile in the ICU , almost as if he were dead ( the respirator was doing the breathing for him ) , I sat with him and talked to him . " Honey , I 'm here , I love you , " I kept repeating . " You 're just doing great . " Sometimes I 'd say , " Dr. Dehoney and John John are here with me and we 're going to hold hands and say a prayer . " One night while I was talking to him , a tear rolled out of John 's eye . I said to the doctor , " Oh my God , he 's crying . " But the doctor replied , " No , we just gave him some medicine that makes his eyes water . " Be that as it may , I was sure John could hear me . Later he told me that all during this time he was immobilized he had wild dreams that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dr. Dehoney and I kept telling him that everything would be all right . So I am sure that in some way he did hear us and we strengthened his will to survive . I then called the foremost expert on ARDS in the country , Dr. Tom Petty of Denver , and arranged to have him flown in to check John . He told me , " Your husband is going to make it . " He said John would have to stay on the respirator for two to five more days . During this time they took X-rays every 30 minutes to monitor his condition . John continued to improve , and soon they could start weaning him from the respirator . That 's one of the hardest parts ; it 's like learning to breathe again . Some other wonderful things happened : We heard from President Reagan every day , as well as from many governors and senators . Spectacular flowers were sent to John , which we sent to the children 's and geriatrics ' wards . My husband received 3,000 cards and letters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bypass surgery , saying , " Imitation is the best form of flattery , but you did n't have to go this far . Get well soon . " Something that did concern me ? the older children could visit their father , but Lincoln was too young to be allowed in the ICU . I knew John needed to see his three-year-old son , that it would help him get well , and I had to figure a way to arrange this . So one day John John took the video camera his father had given me out by the pool . I sat Linc on my lap and he said into the camera , " Hi , Daddy , I miss you . Will you be home soon ? " Then Linc said , " I 'm taking good care of Mommy . Are those nurses taking good care of you ? " and proceeded to jump into the pool and show his daddy how he had learned to swim while John was in the hospital . Then we all sent messages to John . The hospital put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Lincoln came on , John just lit up like a firecracker . The nurses said from that moment on he started improving rapidly . He 'd write , " Play that again , " and they 'd keep running the tape for him . During John 's recovery , I discovered how important it is to keep a patient in close touch with his family . Some hospitals use videotapes so patients can see their loved ones . This is something they 've since started doing at University of Kentucky . Family and friends can also send messages on audio tapes . I also learned that patients who are cooped up day and night in intensive care tend to have strange fantasies and dreams , even hallucinations , which the nurses referred to as ICUitis . They explained to me that most patients usually experience it after only three days . The doctor explained to John and me , too , that these hallucinations are terrifying unless you are prepared for them . Women whose husbands undergo heart surgery or experience other kinds of severe illness should be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and know what is going on and why . During John 's third week in the hospital the doctor had to perform a tracheostomy . The day when John was finally up and around we wanted to take a picture of him walking down the hall because there had been so many stories that he was fatally ill ? even rumors that he had died . When John came into the hall , everyone applauded . Lincoln , who was with me some distance away , screamed , " Daddy ! " broke away , and ran down the hall to his father . He grabbed his daddy 's hand and looked up at him with the most wonderful expression . The photographer kept shooting and that picture was seen all across America . After that there was no stopping John . He really began a rapid recovery . And when the doctors saw what good therapy Lincoln was for John , they let him go into his room . During all the time of John 's illness , I was very conscious that I had to be the Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew everyone else would . I do n't know what came over me , but my strength kept mounting . Maybe it was the knowledge that I had to keep myself together , not just for all those around me , but most importantly for the new life inside me . One night , however , I just let go , started to cry , and could n't stop . My obstetrician , Dr. John W. Greene , was called , and he and his nurse came over . " I 'm so sorry , " I said to the doctor . " Do n't be sorry , " he said . " I want you to cry . If you do n't , it will be worse for the baby . " Then Lincoln came in and said , " Do n't cry , Mommy . Daddy will be okay , he 'll be home soon . " Here was this little three year old comforting me , and when he did , I boohooed more . John came home from the hospital exactly a month after he entered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory sign . But he was still weak . He had lost 30 pounds and needed help for the simplest things : to put on his shoes , brush his teeth , get into the shower . My instinct was to help him constantly , but I had to make myself hold back and let him move ahead on his own . One of the scariest parts was sleeping with him the first night he was home . Every breath he took , I took . He still had to be suctioned because the hole made by the tracheostomy had not completely healed and the nurse would do it during the night . It was frightening Today my husband is just fine . And though he went through an awful siege , there are many positive results : John has stopped being a health planner . He is now a health doer . He has stopped smoking and is on a strict diet and exercise regimen . At first when he tried to exercise he got so tired just from walk . ing to the driveway and back that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked a little further . His friend , who had a similar operation , marked off the path in tenths of a mile , When John first made five-tenths and back , we celebrated with apple juice . At three miles we were elated . We enjoyed our walks together , which was great exercise for me , too , during my pregnancy . Now John walks four miles a day swims 20 laps in the pool , does n't smoke , does n't drink ( even coffee ) , eats sensibly ? most of the time ? and no longer gets upset at little things . He has a whole new set of priorities and a wonderful , upbeat , positive attitude His friends say he looks healthier and stronger than he has in 20 years . One night he called Dr. Petty to tell him how well he was doing and to thank him for coming in . The doctor said " Governor , you 're a very lucky man . Only 38 percent of the people who develop ARDS make it through . We could have lost you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that . Dr. Petty went on to say that once your lungs have healed from ARDS , it never recurs . Afterward John said to me , " It just hit me , Phyl . At 34 you could have been a widow with an unborn baby , a small child , and a big house in an adopted state . " ( I was born and raised in Texas . ) When he said that , I broke down . He held me and I said , " John , each year , 100,000 people have a triple bypass . But God really had to get your full attention by giving you a life-threatening ailment as well ! " I think John believes that . I know I do .
