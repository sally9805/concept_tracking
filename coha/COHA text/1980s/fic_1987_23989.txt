STATE CHAMPIONS By Bobbie Ann Mason In 1952 , when I was in the seventh grade in Cuba , Kentucky , the Cuba Cubs were the state champions in high school basketball . When the Cubs returned from the tournament in Lexington , a crowd greeted them at Eggner 's Ferry bridge over Kentucky Lake , and a convoy fourteen miles long escorted them to Mayfield , the county seat . It was a cold day in March as twelve thousand people watched the Cubs ride around the courthouse square in convertibles . The mayor and other dignitaries made speeches . Willie Foster , the president of the Merit Clothing Company , gave the players and Coach Jack Story free suits from his factory . The coach , a chunky guy in a trench coat like a character in a forties movie , told the crowd , " I 'm mighty glad we could bring back the big trophy . " And All-Stater Howie Crittenden , the razzle-dazzle dribbler , said , " There are two things I 'm proud of today . First , we won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel like a young mule .

The next day the Cubs took off in the convertibles again , leading a motorcade around western Kentucky , visiting the schools in Sedalia , Mayfield , Farmington , Murray , Hardin , Benton , Sharpe , Reidland , Paducah , Kevil , La Bobbie Ann Mason is the author of Shiloh and Other Stories and In Country . Center , Barlow , Wickliffe , Bardwell , Arlington , Clinton , Fulton , and Pilot Oak . I remember the hoopla at the square that day , but at the time I felt a strange sort of distance , knowing that in another year another community would have its champions . I was twelve years old and going through a crisis , so I thought I had a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the seventies , in upstate New York , I met a man who surprised me by actually remembering the Cuba Cubs ' championship . He was a Kentuckian , and although he was from the other side of the state , he had lasting memories of Howie Crittenden and Doodle Floyd . Howie was a great dribbler , he said . And Doodle had a windmill hook shot that had to be seen to be believed . The Cubs were inspired by the Harlem Globetrotters  --  Marcus Haynes 's hall handling influenced Howie and Goose Tatum was Doodle 's model . The Cuba Cubs , I was told , were , in fact , the most incredible success story in the history of Kentucky high school basketball , and the reason was that they were such unlikely champions . " Why , they were just a handful of country boys who could barely afford basketball shoes , " the man told me in upstate New York . " They were ? " This was news to me . " Yes . They were known as the Cinderella Cubs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the Kentucky Wildcats practice . The Cubs were n't in uniform , but one of them called for a ball and dribbled it a few times and then canned a two-hand set shot from midcourt . Adolph Rupp happened to be watching . He 's another Kentucky basketball legend  --  do n't you know anything about Kentucky basketball ? He rushed to the player at midcourt and demanded , ' How did you do that ? ' The boy just smiled . ' It was easy , Mr. Rupp , ' he said . ' Ai n't no wind m here . ' " Of course that was not my image of the Cuba Cubs at all . I had n't realized they were just a bunch of farm boys who got together behind the barn after school and shot baskets in the dirt , while the farmers around complained that the boys would never amount to anything . I had n't known how Coach Jack Story had started them off in the seventh grade , coaching the daylights out of those kids until he made them believe they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year they won the tournament , the Cuba Cubs were the essence of glamour . Seeing them in the gym  --  standing tall in those glossy green satin uniforms , or racing down the court , leaping like deer  --  took my breath away . They had crew cuts and wore real basketball shoes . And the cheerleaders dressed smartly in Crayo la-green corduroy circle skirts , saddle oxfords , and roiled-down socks . They had green corduroy jackets as well as green sweaters , with a C cutting through the symbol of a megaphone . They clapped their hands in rhythm and orchestrated their elbows in a little dance that in some way mimicked the Cubs as they herded the ball down the court . " Go , Cubs , Go ! " " Fight , Cubs , Fight ! " They did " Locomotive , locomotive , steam , steam , steam , " and " Strawberry shortcake , huckleberry pie . " We had pep rallies that were like revival services in tone and intent . The cheerleaders pirouetted and zoomed skyward in unison , their leaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their circle skirts , showing off their green tights underneath . I never questioned the words of the yells , any more than I questioned the name Cuba Cubs . I did n't know what kind of cubs they were supposed to be  --  bear cubs or wildcats or foxes  --  but I never thought about it . I doubt if anyone did . It was the sound of the words that mattered , not the meaning . They were the Cubs . And that was it . Cuba was a tiny community with a couple of general stores , and its name is of doubtful origin , but local historians say that when the Cuba post office opened , in the late 1850s , the Ostend Manifesto had been in the news . This was a plan the United States had for getting control of the island of Cuba in order to expand the slave trade . The United States demanded that Spain either sell us Cuba at a fair price or surrender it outright . Perhaps the founding fa . thers of Cuba , Kentucky ( old-time pronunciation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or maybe they just had romantic imaginations . In the Jackson Purchase , the western region of Kentucky and Tennessee that Andrew Jackson purchased from the Chickasaw Indians in 1818 , there are other towns with faraway names : Moscow , Dublin , Kansas , Cadiz , Beulah , Paris , and Dresden . The gymnasium where the Cuba Cubs prac-the bleachers . Several classrooms opened onto the gym floor , with the study hall at one end . The lower grades occupied a separate building , and in those grades we used an outhouse . But in junior high we had the privilege of using the indoor restrooms , which also opened onto the gym . ( The boys ' room included a locker room for the team , but like the outhouses , the girls ' room did n't even have private compartments . ) The route from the study hall to the girls ' room was dangerous . We had to walk through the gym , along the sidelines , under some basketball hoops . There were several baskets , so many players could practice their shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cuba Cubs , all the junior high boys used the gym too , in frantic emulation of their heroes . On the way to the restroom you had to calculate quickly and carefully when you could run beneath a basket . The players pretended that they were oblivious to you , but just when you thought you were safe and could dash under the basket , they would hurl a ball out of nowhere and the ball would fall on your head as you streaked by . Even though I was sort of a tomboy and liked to run  --  back in the fifth grade I could run as fast as most of the boys  --  I had no desire to play basketball . It was too violent . Doodle Floyd himself bopped me on the head once , but I doubt if he remembers it . The year of the championship was the year 1 got in trouble for running in the study hall . At lunch hour one day , Judy Howell and I decided to run the length of the gym as fast as we could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us . We raced through the gym and kept on running , unable to slow down , finally skidding to a stop in the study hall . We were giggling because we had caught a glimpse of what one of the senior players was wearing under his green practice shorts ( different from the satin show shorts they wore at the games ) , when Mr. Gilhorn , the history teacher , big as a buffalo , appeared before us and growled , " What do you young ladies think you 're doing ? " I had on the tightest Levi 's I owned . When they were newly washed and ironed , they fit snug . My mother had ironed a crease in them . I had on a cowboy shirt and a bandanna . Mr. Gilhorn went on , " Now girls , do we run in our own living rooms ? Does your mama let you run in the house ? " " Yes , " I said , staring at him confidently . " My mama always lets me run in the house . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my habit to contradict whatever anybody assumed . If I was supposed to be a lady , then I would be a cowboy . The truth in this instance was that it had never occurred to me to run in our house . It was too small , and the floorboards were shaky . Therefore , I reasoned , my mother had never laid down the law about not running in the house . Judy said , " We wo n't do it again . " But I would n't promise . " I know what would be good for you girls , " said Mr. Gilhorn in a kindly , thoughtful tone , as if he had just had a great idea . That meant the duckwalk . As punishment , Judy and I had to squat , grabbing our ankles , and duckwalk around the gym . We waddled , humiliated , with the basketballs heating on our heads and the players following our progress with loud quacks of derision . " This was your fault , " Judy claimed . She stopped speaking to me , which disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I admired her short blond curls and color-coordinated outfits . She had been to Detroit one summer . During study-hall periods , we could hear the basketballs pounding the floor . We could tell when a player made a basket that pause after the ball hit the backboard and sank luxuriously into the net before hitting the floor . 1 visited the library more often than necessary just to get a glimpse of the Cubs practicing as I passed the door to the gym . The library was a shelf at one end of the study hall , and it had a couple of hundred old books mostly hand-me-downs from the Graves County Library , including outdated textbooks and even annuals from Kentucky colleges . That year I read some old American histories , and a biography of Benjamin Franklin , and the " Junior Miss " books . On the wainscoted walls of the study hall were gigantic framed pictures , four feet high , each composed of inset portraits of all the faculty members and the seniors of a specific year . They gazed down at us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for each frame , and they dated all the way back to the early forties . In junior high , we shared the study hall with the high school students . The big room was drafty , and in the winter it was very cold . The boys were responsible for keeping the potbelly stove filled with coal from the coal pile outside , near where the school buses were parked . In grade school during the winter , I had worn long pants under my dresses  --  little starched print dresses with gathered skirts and puffed sleeves . But in junior high , the girls wore blue jeans , like the boys , except that we rolled them up almost to our knees . The Cuba Cubs wore Levi 's and green basketball jackets , and the other high school boys  --  the Future Farmers of America  --  wore bright blue FFA jackets . Although the FFA jackets did n't have the status of the basketball jackets , they were beautiful . They were royal-blue corduroy and on the back was an enormous gold eagle , embraced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graves County ) . I had a crush on a freshman named Glenn in an FFA jacket . He helped manage the coal bucket in the study hall . Glenn did n't ride my bus . He lived in Dukedom , down across the Tennessee line . Glenn was one of the Cuba Cubs , but he was n't one of the major Cubs he was on the B team and did n't yet have a green jacket . But I admired his dribble , and his long legs could travel that floor like a bicycle . When I waited at the edge of the gym for my chance to bolt to the girls ' room , I sometimes stood and watched him dribble . Then one day as I ran pell-mell to the restroom , his basketball hit me on the head and he called to me flirtatiously . " I got a claim on her , " he yelled out to the world . If a boy had a claim on a girl , it meant she was his girlfriend . The next day in study hall he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li'l Abner comic strip . In the eight-page novel , Li'l Abner peed on Daisy Mae . It was disgusting , but I was thrilled that he showed me the booklet . " Hey , let me show you these hand signals , " Glenn said a couple of days later , out on the playground . " ln case you ever need them . " He stuck his middle finger straight up and folded the others down . " That 's single F , " he said . Then he turned down his two middle fingers , leaving the forefinger and the little finger upright , like horns . " That 's double F , " he said confidently . " Oh , " I said . At first I thought he meant hand signals used in driving . Cars did n't have automatic turn signals then . There were other hand signals . In basketball , the coach and the players exchanged finger gestures . The cheerleaders clapped us on to victory . And with lovers , lightly scraping the index finger on the other 's palm meant " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way meant " Yes . " If you did n't know this and you held hands with a boy , you might inadvertently agree to do something that you had no intention of doing . Seventh grade was the year we had a different perpetual state of excitement . It was 1952 and the Cuba Cubs were on their way to the championship . Judy was still mad at me , but Glenn 's sister Willowdean was in my class , and I contrived to go home with her one evening , riding her unfamiliar school bus along gravel roads far back into the country . Country kids did n't socialize much . To go home with someone and spend the night was a big event , strange and unpredictable . Glenn and Willowdean lived with three brothers and sisters in a small house surrounded by bare , stubbled tobacco fields . It was a wintry day , but Willowdean and I played outdoors , and I watched for Glenn to arrive . He had stayed late at school , practicing ball , and the coach brought him home . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came in with his father from milking , his mother handed him a tray of food . " Come on and go with me , " he said to me . His Levi 's were smudged with cow manure . His mother said , " Make sure she 's got her teeth . " " Have you got your teeth ? " Glenn asked me with a grin . His mother swatted at him crossly . " I meant Bluma . You know who I meant . " Glenn motioned with a nod of his head for me to follow him , and we went to a tiny back room where Glenn 's grandmother sat in a wheelchair in a corner with a heater at her feet . She had dark hair and lips painted bright orange and a growth on her neck . " She do n't talk , " Glenn said . " But she can hear . " The strange woman jerked her body in a spasm of acknowledgment as Glenn set the supper tray in her lap . He fished her teeth out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She squeaked like a mouse . " Are you hungry ? " Glenn asked me as we left the room . " We 've got chicken and dumplings tonight . That 's my favorite . " That night I slept with Willowdean on a foldout couch in the living room , with newspaper-wrapped hot bricks at our feet . We huddled under four quilts and whispered . I worked the conversation around to Glenn . " He told me he liked you , " Willowdean said . I could feel myself blush . At supper , Glenn had tickled me under the table . " I 'll tell you a secret if you promise not to tell , " she said . " What ? " I loved secrets and usually did n't tell them . " Betty Jean 's going to have a baby . " Willowdean 's sister Betty Jean was a sophomore . On the school bus her boyfriend Roy Matthews had kept his arm around her during the whole journey , while she cracked gum and looked pleased with herself . That evening at the supper table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's big feet . Willowdean whispered now , " Did you see the way she ate supper ? Like a pig . That 's because she has to eat for two . She 's got a baby in her stomach . " " What will she do ? " I asked , scared . The warmth of the bricks was fading , and I knew it would be a freezing night . " Her and Roy will live with us , " said Willow-dean , " That 's what my sister Mary Lou did at first . But then she got mad and took the baby off and went to live with her husband 's folks . She said they treated her better . " The high school classes were small because kids dropped out , to have babies and farm . They seemed to disappear , like our calves going off to the slaughterhouse in the fall , and it was creepy . " I do n't want to have a baby and have to quit school , " I said . " You do n't ? " Willowdean was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for ? " I did n't answer . I. did n't have the words handy . But she did n't seem to notice . She turned over and pulled the quilts with her . In the darkness , I could hear a mouse squeaking . But it was n't a mouse . Ir was Willowdean 's grandmother , in her cold room at the rt. ! , back of the house . 1 hat winter , while basketball fever raged , a student teacher from Murray State College taught Kentucky history . She was very pretty and resembled a picture of Pocahontas in one of the library books . One time when she sat down , flipping her large gathered skirt up , I saw her panties . They were pink . She was so soft-spoken she did n't know how to make us behave well enough to accomplish any classwork . Daniel Boone 's exploits were nothing , compared to Doodle Floyd 's . During the week the Cubs were at the tournament Pocahontas could n't keep us quiet . The school was raising money for next year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mothers had made . Frequently there was a knock at the door , and some kids from another grade would be there selling Rice Krispies squares wrapped in waxed paper , or brownies , or sometimes divinity fudge . One day , while Pocahontas was reading to us about Daniel Boone and the Indians , and we were throwing paper wads , there was a sudden pounding on the door . I was hoping for divinity , and I had a nickel with me , but the door burst open and Judy Howell 's sister Georgia was there , crying , " Judy Bee ! Mama 's had a wreck and Linda Faye 's killed . " Judy flew out of the room . For one moment the class was quiet , and then it went into an uproar . Pocahontas did n't know what to do , so she gave us a pop quiz . The next day we learned that Judy 's little sister Linda Faye , who was three years old , had been thrown into a ditch when her mother slammed into a truck that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rook up a collection for flowers . I was stunned by the news of death , for 1 had never known a child to die . I could n't sleep , and my mind went over and over the accident , imagining the truck plowing into the car and Linda Faye pitching out the door or through the window . I created various scenes , ways it might have happened . I kept seeing her stretched out stiff on her side , like the dead animals I had seen on our farm . At school I was sleepy , and I escaped into daydreams about Glenn , imagining that I had gone to Lexington too , to watch him in triumph as he was called in from the sidelines to replace Doodle Floyd , who had turned his ankle . It was a sober , long walk from the study hall to the restroom . The gymnasium seemed desolate , without the Cubs practicing . I walked safely down the gym , remembering the time in the fourth grade when I was a flower girl in the court of the basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower petals down the center of the gym , scattering rose petals so the queen could step on them as she minced slowly toward her throne . I was too scared to go to the funeral , and my parents did n't want me to go . My father had been traumatized by funerals in his childhood and he did n't think they were a good idea . " The Howells live so far away , " Mama said . " And it looks like snow . " That weekend , the tournament was on the radio , and I listened carefully , hoping to hear Glenn 's name . The final game was crazy . In the background , the cheerleaders chanted : Warren , Warren , he 's our man If he ca n't do it Floyd can Floyd , Floyd , he 's our man If he ca n't do it Crittenden can The announcer was saying , " Crittenden 's dribbling has the crowd on its feet . It 's a thrilling game ! The Cubs were beaten twice by this same Louisville Manual squad during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cubs pulled even at 39-39 when Floyd converted a charity flip , and then Warren sent them ahead for the first time with a short one-bander on Crittenden 's pass . The crowd is going wild ! " Toward the end of the game the whole Coliseum  --  except for a small Manual cheering section  --  was yelling , " Hey , hey , what do you say ? It looks like Cuba all the way ! " As I listened to the excited announcer chatter about huddles and timeouts and driving jumps and hook shots , I forgot about Judy , but then on Sunday , when I went to the courthouse square to welcome the Cubs home , her sister 's death struck me again like fresh news . Seeing so many people celebrating made me feel uncomfortable , as if the death of a child always went unnoticed , like a dead dog by the side of the road . It was a cold day , and I had to wear a dress because it was Sunday . I wanted to see Glenn . I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I wanted to give him a hug , of congratulations . I would plant a big wet kiss on his cheek . I had seen a cheerleader do this to one of the players once after he made an unusual number of free throws . It was at a home game , one of the few I attended . I wanted to hug Glenn because it would be my answer to his announcement that he had a claim on me . It would be silent , without explanation , but he would know what it meant . I managed to lose my parents in the throng and I headed for the east side of the square , where the dime store was . Suddenly I saw Judy , with her mother , in front of a shoe store . I knew the funeral had been the day before , but here they were at the square , in the middle of a celebration . Judy and her mother were still in their Sunday church clothes . Judy saw me . She looked straight at me , then turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried to the center of the square , looking for Glenn . But when I finally saw him up ahead , 1 stopped . He looked different . The Cubs , 1 learned later , had all gone to an Army surplus store and bought themselves pairs of Army fatigue pants and porkpie hats . Glenn looked unfamiliar in his basketball jacket- now he had one  --  and the baggy Army fatigues instead of his Levi 's . The hat looked silly . I thought about Judy , and how her sister 's death had occurred while Glenn was away playing basketball and buying new clothes . I wanted to tell him what it was like to be at home when such a terrible thing happened , but I could n't , even though I saw him not thirty feet from me . As I hesitated , I saw his parents and Willowdean and one of his brothers crowd around him . Playfully , Willow-dean knocked his hat off . The tournament was over , but we were still wild with our victory . Senior play practice started then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers were busy coaching the seniors on their lines in the play . Maybe they had dreams of Broadway . If the Cubs could go to the tournament , anything was possible . Judy returned to school , but everyone was afraid to speak to her . They whispered behind her back . And Judy began acting aloof , asthough she had some secret knowledge that lifted her above us . On one last cool day in early spring we had cleanup day , and there were no classes all day . Everyone was supposed to help clean the school grounds , picking up all the discarded candy wrappers and drink bottles . There was a bonfire , and instead of a plate lunch in the lunchroom  --  too much like the plain farm food we had to eat at home  --  we had hot dogs , boiled outside in a kettle over the fire . The fat hot dogs in the cold air tasted heavenly . They steamed like breath . Just as I finished my hot dog and drank the last of my RC ( we had a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice which people chose which  --  it seemed to divide people into categories ) , Judy came up behind me and whispered , " Come out there with me , " She pointed toward the graveyard across the road . I followed her , and as we walked between solemn rows of Wilcoxes and lngrahams and Morrisons and Crittendens , the noise of the playground receded . Judy located a spot of earth , a little brown heap that was not grassed over , even though the dandelions had already come up and turned to fluff . She knelt beside the dirt pile , like a child in a sandbox , and fussed with a pot of artificial flowers . She straightened them and poked them down into the pot , as if they were real . As she worked tenderly but firmly with the flowers , she said , " Mama says Linda Faye will be waiting for us in heaven . That 's her true home .

I could n't say anything , for we were n't raised to say things that were heartfelt and gracious . Country kids did n't learn manners . Manners were too embarrassing . Learning not to run in the house was about the extent of what we knew about how to act . We did n't learn to congratulate people ; we did n't wish people happy birthday . We did n't even address each other by name . And we did n't jump up and spontaneously hug someone for joy . Only cheerleaders claimed that talent . We did n't say we were sorry . We hid from view , in case we might be called on to make appropriate remarks , the way certain old folks in church were sometimes called on to pray . At Cuba School , there was one teacher who , for punishment , made her students write " I love you " five hundred times on the blackboard . " Love " was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the girls ' restroom  --  blazing there in ugly red lipstick .
