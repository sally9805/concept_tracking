It was billed as an opportunity for " upper-middle-class , white Anglo- Saxon Protestants " to learn the finer points of prison life . But for some of the 30 Wheaton College students who recently were locked up in the old Du Page County Jail , it was more of a lark . " It was like a slumber party , " one student said moments after being released from a cell that at one time held people charged with murder and rape . For other students , the experience was tempered only by the fact that " we knew we were going to be getting out . " " You ' re so bored because there ' s nothing to do , " said a student after he was allowed to emerge from his cell for a midnight discussion to let the participants to unwind . Another said , " I began to pace , and I never pace . " Despite the mixed reviews , Ivan Fahs , chairman of Wheaton College ' s sociology department , said he will repeat the experiment if given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Stanford University in the early 1970s . " I was very wary because of the previous experiments that had been done , " said Fahs , who monitored each of the students during the lock-up for premature signs of stress . Because of the possibility of dangerously stressful situations , he said , the experiment was conducted in the old county jail , where there were no prisoners and volunteers could serve as guards . In previous episodes , such as the Stanford study , some participants had to be removed because of stress-related symptoms ranging from crying to violence , Fahs said . Noting that several Wheaton College students might one day become missionaries , he said , " Not only was I trying to teach what it ' s like to be in those shoes ( of a prisoner ) but also impress that they may be in those shoes " because missionaries often are kidnap targets in developing countries .

So for five hours the students were subjected to the vagaries of prison life , ranging from " abusive guards " and solitary confinement to being unable to control the smallest thing in their lives , such as turning the lights on or off . Cold concrete , steel bars and impersonal bunks fitted with vinyl-covered 2-inch mattresses and foul-smelling vinyl-covered pillows were their home . " I was frightened by the physical or sexual abuse that would be possible in there , " said a female student , whose comment brought nods of agreement from other women in the experiment . But there were other fears . After being put in solitary confinement , " every noise seemed magnified and echoed , " said sophomore Joelyn Stolte . " I kept turning around to make sure no one had accidentally been left behind and was waiting to club me over the head . " " I really do not understand how a prisoner can withstand solitary confinement knowing that he may have six months of it , " said Lance Cage , a junior . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairness could be destroyed in prison . " I was issued an ill-fitting jumpsuit , which I was sure would give me AIDS or TB or some other dread disease , " he said .
