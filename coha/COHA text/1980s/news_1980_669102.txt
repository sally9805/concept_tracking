Some 30 scholars and writers from 22 colleges and universities across the nation are scheduled to participate , according to Edwin Squiers , associate professor of biology and director of environmental science at Taylor University , Uplands , Ind. // Dr. Taylor , who also serves as coordinator of advanced studies at Au Sable Trails , said the keynote address will be delivered by Jeremy Rifkin of the Washington , D.C. , People ' s Business Commission , whose book " The Emerging Order " has aroused considerable discussion in Washington circles. // Nestled among lakes and woods in the middle of northern Lower Michigan , Au Sable Trails sits on 145 acres of woods and open areas , with two large ponds and 400-foot frontage on Big Twin Lake. // It was founded 20 years ago as a boys ' summer camp with a Christian emphasis. // Its prime movers and shakers were , and still are , Harold Snyder , a former botany teacher at Grand Rapids Community College in Grand Rapids , Mich. , and Bert Froysland , chairman of the English department at East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision and energy of its staff and the six-figure income from two oil and gas wells , Au Sable Trails has grown into an environmental study center focused on the needs of small liberal arts colleges of Christian orientation which can ' t afford to support field stations of their own. // During its early years the camp made a friend in " louie , " local resident Louis Kleinschmidt. // When he passed on in 1968 , it was discovered he had willed 80 acres of land to Au Sable Trails . Soon thereafter an oil-gas boom developed in the area . Two successful wells were drilled on the property Louie gave to the camp , in 1972 and 1974 , the income from which pays the institution ' s basic costs as well as building an endowment fund. // The center ' s cluster of buildings , including dormitories , library , and lounge , sits among trees on a crest overlooking " Louie ' s Pond , " on the opposite shore of which stands the commodious cedar home of Dr. Snyder. // " Louie ' s Pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barr , one of two resident directors , explained to a recent visitor . " Snyder started them here 10 years ago with four pairs he obtained from the Kellogg Bird Sanctuary . Now there are 94 birds. // " We hope to establish a permanent Michigan flock of Canada geese , similar to the mute swan flock . As long as we provide open water and feed they will stay through the winter , " he explained. // Mr. Barr said the other pond supports an active colony of nine beavers. // The rest of the property is a combination of woods and open fields , ideal for environmental studies , " Mr. Barr said , adding that there are a number of other spots in the environs where scientists and students can carry out on-the-spot research . One of these is the Kirtland ' s warbler sanctuary in the nearby Huron-Manistee National Forest , where a controlled burn broke loose in early May , burning 25 , 000 acres of forest and destroying 38 dwellings. // Soon after founding the summer camp , Harold Snyder went back to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and joined the faculty of Taylor University. // A curriculum of environmental studies for elementary school pupils from kindergarten through sixth grade was developed in 1977 with the nearby public school districts of Mancelona and Kalkaska . Some 2 , 000 students from the two systems receive field instruction annually at Au Sable Trails under the direction of Patricia Fagg , a native of Dayton , Ohio , and a graduate of Taylor University. // " Each grade has a different experience revolving around the natural sciences , " Ms. Fagg said . " The units are sequential . From kindergarten to second grade the emphasis is on awareness of the environment. // " Third grade serves as the link between the lower grades and Grades 4 , 5 , and 6 , which collect and analyze data . The fourth-graders concentrate on pond studies , the fifth on winter and how man adapts to it . The sixth conducts a wildlife census on the property. " // Concomitant with this , Mr. Barr has supervised the development of a program on winter retreats. // " These began with small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , " he said , explaining that " most of the original founders were evangelical in origin. // " These retreats were informal and run on a small scale for several years . But in 1973 , when Snyder moved up here permanently , he began bringing conservation classes up each weekend in the fall in groups of 15 . He would guide them through pretty intense field and laboratory studies. " // Here again the students were drawn from small liberal arts colleges with a Christian emphasis , in the Grand Rapids area , as well as Indiana and Ohio . It is coeducational throughout. // " We ' ve had something going every weekend from Christmas through March , plus several college groups during the week , " Mr. Barr said. // Cross-country skiing , which he also instructs , is an important aspect of the retreat program. // The growing emphasis on college work began after Dr. Snyder joined the Taylor University faculty , with more and more college students included in the summer camp program. // " The emphasis in summer became educational as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a boys ' camp . We are an institution for environmental studies . Last summer was the last summer ' s traditional boy ' s camp , " the young man said. // " We are accredited by the state as an educational institution licensed under the same umbrella which licenses computer-programming , auto-mechanic , and flight schools , " he said. // " This summer we are offering college courses from May 15 through Aug. 25 , running the whole gamut from astronomy , aquatic biology , and entomology to conservation , ornithology , and general biology , plus photography , drawing , and a course in fiction writing. // " Because this is a year of transition , credits for these courses will be given by the college to which the professor is attached. " // There will be four three-week sessions , with most courses giving three or four credits . Each student will take one course per session . Fees will vary depending on what is charged by the college offering the course , but roughly $60 per hour or $180 per course , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per week. // //
