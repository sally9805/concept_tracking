 | After a week of taut psychological sparring for Saturday night 's climactic showdown of the Winter Olympics , Katarina Witt skated before Debi Thomas . Actually , she hardly seemed to skate . She flirted . In the slow segment of her " Carmen " program , she threw risk-taking to the wind . In lieu of daring jumps , the East German beauty seemed content to seek points with her coy shrugs , come-hither expressions and smiling eyes . The result was enchanting . And almost disastrous . Witt received her usual 5.9 scores for artistic impression . But the judges penalized her caution with modest technical scores , leaving a wide opening for her American antagonist Thomas . But if Witt was guilty of thinking she could win on beguilement alone , Thomas exhibited an even more damaging form of hubris . She did n't simply skate , either . She attacked . She seemed to want to flaunt her superior athleticism and prove once and for all that her sport was more than a beauty contest . She was determined to jump higher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the reckless . But her usual verve was missing . As she put it , " I was n't on my feet . " She paid for her flights of daring with some awkward and costly landings . " Well , back to school , " she said to coach Alex McGowan afterward . She added ruefully , " I gave it away . " Actually , she gave away not only the gold but the silver . She settled for third , behind Witt and the crowd-pleasing hometown favorite , Elizabeth Manley of Canada . Long known for a tendency to fall in major events , the 22-year-old Ottawa native decided to skate this Olympics " for the joy of it . " The joy burst from her every leap , and she actually won the final night 's competition , although she could n't erase Witt 's earlier lead . " This was all the Debi and Katarina story here , and that was fine with me , " she said . " I was off on my own , having dreams about this night . " Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the week . As her scores were posted for the short program Thursday night , coach McGowan held his nose in disgust . He charged that sex appeal had overcome the seven male judges ? there were , in fact , six males on the panel of nine ? and nationalism had swayed the three Eastern-bloc judges . But after her bitter finale , Thomas rejected excuses and looked bravely to her future . " Will you be back for another Olympics ? " " No way , " she said firmly . Then she brightened . " But I 'm still alive . Now I can get on with my life and be fine . " On the fringe : Witt 's exit scene was characteristic . At the rink , she was introduced to Alberto Tomba , the movie-star handsome Italian who won two golds as he radiated his charm across the ski slopes . They embraced and he lingered nearby for the rest of the evening . While hardly a full-blown romance , this conjured irresistible visions of how the tale might end . Was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner to defect into East Germany ? Silly thoughts were allowed Saturday , because even on a disappointing night for its heroines , figure skating thrives on whim and illusion . Perched out on the @# @#  | fringes of what most of the world considers real sport , it has long been a treasured Olympic event because of its sheer theatricality . Peggy Fleming was a prima ballerina , Dorothy Hamill an adventurous , mophaired waif on a yellow-brick rink ? and both won over the warm hearts and cold judges of the Olympic arena . But in all of figure skating 's echoes of ballet or Hollywood through the years , no duel ever encompassed the head-to-head drama of Thomas against Witt . Perhaps it is simplistic to say it was ice against fire , leotards against lace , substance against style . But this quadrennial rite thrives on simple story lines . And Thomas and Witt provided one . Thomas reached for the sky while Witt tugged at the heartstrings . Thomas brought her adoring entourage ; Witt , accompanied only by a few team officials , attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the less than grand finale , the clash of their styles sent ripples of emotion and controversy through Calgary . " I think I have a good body , " Thomas said weakly after her narrow and disputed loss to Witt in Thursday 's short program . Since her performance had made that abundantly clear , the statement revealed some of her insecurity and animosity toward Witt . " People seem to think that if you can jump , you ca n't be artistic . " No one really thought that . On the other hand , no journalist proposed marriage to Thomas at the drop of a press conference ? as one did at a mobbed session saluting Witt 's arrival . " I think we would have to get to know one another better , " replied the unfazed Witt with a smile that left all possibilities open . With such stagecraft , no wonder that Witt is an aspiring actress . Leading the movement for Parental Guidance warnings was Peter Dunfield , who coached Canada 's Manley to her delightful triumph . " We 're here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huffed Dunfield at the first wiggle of Witt 's hips . " All that 's missing is the horse and the reins . It 's a circus . " Witt appeared to make a concession to such puritanism with her outfits last week . It was a small concession . She was as sensuous as ever in her programs . Born to the stage : Witt wore the mantle of superstar with consummate grace . Thomas , 20 , is a well-rounded young woman who will continue her premed studies at Stanford . But Witt , 22 , showed that she is neither bimbo nor programmed East German machine when she answered questions fluently and inventively in English as well as German . And while her rival seemed high-strung and defensive in conversation , Witt acted born to the Olympic stage . At various events , she signed autographs and posed for pictures . She let photographers follow her on a shopping expedition to the Chinook Centre mall , making the purchase of a cowboy hat into a fashion statement . A center of rapt attention in the Olympic Village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several evenings at the disco . Thomas signed fewer autographs . A volunteer worker at the compulsories reported that she was the only competitor to refuse her . This was surprising because Janice Thomas said that her daughter originally shortened her name from Debbie to facilitate autograph chores . As for Team Thomas 's view of Witt 's posturing , the American skater 's boyfriend , Brian Vandenhogen , commented chivalrously , " I think Katarina 's a showoff . You know how some people rub you the wrong way ? " On Thursday , Thomas did little for her own sporting image when a camera caught her grimacing at the high scores of Canada 's Manley and mouthing what could charitably be lip-read as , " Oh , shoot . " " I did n't swear , " Thomas explained somewhat lamely . " I swear I did n't swear . I , uh , sneered . " Even Witt 's flashy diplomacy had a sharp edge . She seemed eager to psych NEWSWEEK : MARCH 7 , 1988 63 @#  | her foe at practices , jogging around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is much better than last year , " Witt said sweetly . But East German reporter Monika Schuller said afterward that Witt was " not impressed " by Thomas . Witt herself was not immune to the pressure . After her usual desultory run through the compulsories , she blew up at coach Jutta Muller during that night 's practice . She had to leave the ice to regain her composure . The next day she had another uneasy practice . Perhaps both women left a bit of themselves in the pre-event posing and publicity . But when the projected grand opera became more of a war of attrition , Witt harbored enough of the right stuff . Speed-skater Bonnie Blair , the second most visible American star last week , had little pre-race buildup and no concerns about costuming or judging . Her own fierce battle , with East Germany 's Christa Rothenburger , was quick and technical . But when she won it , her gold medal was strictly prime time . The popular 23-year-old Blair , a member of a large skating family and heroine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watched as Rothenburger preceded her ? and set a world record in the 500 meters . In the few tense moments before Blair 's turn , her coach said simply , " You can beat her . " Photo finish : " I know I can , " said Blair . She did it by the margin of two one-hundredths of a second . If speed skaters raced one another instead of the clock , she would have won the photo finish by all of 101/2 inches . After what she called the best start of her life , Blair admitted that she struggled to the wire : " I think I just got it on guts . " For many heralded performers , the final days of the Games held all the charm of the snow that was melting rapidly in the local heat wave . Swiss skiing hero Pirmin Zurbriggen saw his dream of five golds turn into just one . His favored female teammates also faltered as Austrian women like Anita Wachter and Sigrid Wolf seized the slopes . And after a 5-0 rout at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team could have altered its anthem to " Woe , Canada . " @# Only Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykanen justified his billing , adding two more golds to the one he had won opening week . But it was a mark of his lack of charisma , and perhaps of the world 's Olympic attention span , that he received less attention than self-promoting failure Eddie ( The Eagle ) Edwards , the bumbling British jumper . In a festival built on television , there was a weird logic to the fact that the silent Finn proceeded home , while The Eagle flew on to " The Tonight Show . " The real bombast on the mountains was left , suitably , to the stocky , flamboyant Italian slalom specialist and Katarina Witt @# fan , " La Bomba " Tomba . " I am a beast ! " he often shouts ? and he indeed attacked both the giant slalom and slalom with savage abandon . He won the first decisively , the second in one of the most thrilling finishes of the Games . While delighting his singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the victory Ferrari promised him by his father : " I want it red . " But in one quiet interlude , he also allowed tears to well up in his eyes . " I 'm no beast , " he said . " I 'm no Bomba . I 'm just one happy man . " Warmed over : Not that Tomba was left to carry the entire bombast burden . The American bobsleds careered downhill accompanied by the background whining of alternates excluded from the race . Perennial East German champ Wolfgang Hoppe was in an apparently justified rage over the sandpaper consistency of the warmed-over course . And U.S. hockey coach Dave Peterson had to endure criticism of his team 's " lack of cohesion " from that noted authority on the sport , International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain . But the U.S. Olympic Committee administered the coup de grace . In the wake of the team 's weak performance , it appointed a special commission to evaluate what 's wrong and find ways to fix it . USOC president Robert Helmick said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " The man they chose fit the job description : owner George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees . The Boss 's arrival in Calgary touched off fascinating speculation . Would slow skiers be shuttled regularly to a farm team in Columbus ? Is Billy Martin already filling in a biathlon lineup card ? And if Steinbrenner fails to stockpile enough free agents , will the nation soon turn its lonely eyes to Don Trump ? Ted Turner ? Oliver North ? The only answer so far is that bureaucrats and jingoistic fans are taking a few lost medals a bit too seriously . And they will continue to do so as long as there are torch relays , TV revenues and quadrennial fortnights of unreality like the one that swirled to its sequined climax last weekend . @#
