Most of us can not identify with it . <P> Charlotte Swatek Greendale , Wis . <P> My husband considers many things I do costly and silly . Mrs. Reagan is not the First Lady yet , but she is already riding in a presidential jet to Monsieur Marc 's in New York City to get her hair done . Well , there is one good thing about it : Mrs. Reagan will help take the heat off me here at home for four years . <P> Carol S.
