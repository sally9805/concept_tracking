It was a tough point , this 1-1 tie that the Bruins and the Whalers played here last night before a crowd of 13,107 - and for Boston it came out of what they call a " three-pointmen " power play . For the Whalers it came out of what coach Larry Pleau calls " the goalie who is our future . " That goalie would be Greg Millen , and he gave his team an outstanding first period . " He gave us a chance to be in the game , " Pleau said . And the Bruins didn ' t get the tying goal until the middle of the third period . But then they were playing " a tight defensive game , " according to Bruin coach Gerry Cheevers , " the same kind of close checking we want to play tonight against Washington , " and Bobby Carpenter of Peabody at the Garden ( 7:05 , Ch. 38 , WITS ) . The Whalers took a 1-0 lead in the first period with Millen making five excellent saves and with Blaine Stoughton , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net , getting the goal . He slipped into the slot , about 10 feet out , where he took a pass out from behind the goal by Rick MacLeish , and snapped the puck past Vachon ' s left . It was Hartford ' s first shot of the game . Millen frustrated the Bruins after that and neither team did much skating in the second period . The Bruins ' tying goal in the third period is the dividend you get when you have three pointmen on the power play . In effect that ' s what the Bruins do when they put Ray Bourque at right wing and Brad Park and Mike O ' Connell at the points . The goal developed from a situation in which the Bruins were holding the puck in the attacking zone and playing catch with it until the right moment to shoot came . " When Bourque is in the right circle , " said Park , " I can move to the middle and if they send a man with me I can get the puck back to him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or Park can pass it to the right point to O ' Connell . So , first Bourque had an open shot from the right circle that hit the outside of the near post . The Bruins kept control until O ' Connell passed across the ice to Park who had made his move to the middle . Park shot , as Bourque moved to the slot and Peter McNab , at the top of the crease , " was turning to look for a rebound , " he said . The puck went off the shaft of his stick and under Millen ' s stick hand ( which is his left ) and the Bruins had the tie . " Any time Park shoots from back there it ' s as dangerous as any shot in hockey , " said McNab . " You can score only once on a power play so you can wait for the good oportunity . The way we play it with three point men we should be able to get one of them open . " " We played a pretty good game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances in the first period . We didn ' t do much in the second , but we came back played a pretty good third period . We didn ' t want to open up . We played tight defensively and believe it or not that produced chances . It ' s the way we have to play , especially against good skating teams . They ' re all good skating teams . " Cheevers liked Millen ' s enthusiasm and that was one of the things Pleau cited about Millen ' s play . Millen is the free-agent goalie the Whalers lured away from Pittsburgh . " I ' ve seen teams wait and wait for a goalie to develop . We were able to get a 24-year old goalie who has a chance to be a helluva goalie in a few years . To build a team you have to have a good goalie . Our future is three or four years down the line - and that ' s when he ' ll be at his peak . What we need immediately is to play good team defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good goalie . He gave us a tough time in the playoffs a couple of years ago when he was with Pittsburgh . The next time we play Hartford I hope he forgets what he did in this game . " The Whalers who were supposed to be the laughing stock of hockey this season have posted back to back ties with Montreal and Boston . No one ' s laughing now , not even the Whalers because it ' s too early for the last laugh . But a little smile is all right .
