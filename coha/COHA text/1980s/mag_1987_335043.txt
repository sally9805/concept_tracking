It was the largest of the 69 U.S. banks that have failed this year . The collapse of Unitedbank-Houston ( assets : $218 million ) showed once again how shaky some parts of the American financial system are , especially in the depressed oil patch . When officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shut down the bank last week , TIME Correspondent Richard Woodbury went along to see how such an operation is carried out . As it happened , the drama had an unexpected denouement . His report : <P> Reeling from bad loans and famished for new capital , Unitedbank was a prime candidate for closure . Still , when an army of FDIC liquidators marched without warning into the bank 's headquarters in a downtown skyscraper , the staff of 100 were traumatized . Secretaries wept as the intruders posted notices on the inlaid-glass walls , changed the door locks and dismantled automatic-teller machines . " We kept hearing the rumors , but nobody thought that this time it would be us , " sighed Teller Erica Joiner , 30 , who watched as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials affixed blue seals to cash drawers . <P> Unitedbank 's fall resulted from the go-go style of Chairman Vincent Kickerillo , a local land developer . Taking over in 1968 , Kickerillo overcommitted the bank to real estate loans and investments in other banks during the oil boom of the late ' 70s and early ' 80s . When the economy soured in 1982 , so did Unitedbank . By this year it was losing $1 million a month . For a time Kickerillo , a self-made millionaire who commuted to work in a jet helicopter , covered the losses himself . But after an audit three weeks ago showed Unitedbank to be $7 million in the red , authorities moved to declare it insolvent . <P> Last Wednesday 150 FDIC liquidators began gathering in Houston . To avoid detection that could lead to a run on the bank , they slipped into a downtown hotel under the cover identity of " Gulf Coast Tours . " At 3:12 the next afternoon , minutes after the end of the banking day , they started streaming into the classy marble headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a basement lobby , Liquidation Specialist Timothy Putnam told them , " As of now , you 're on the payroll of the FDIC . You 'll get overtime tonight . Balance your windows . Finish your processing . Dinner is coming in . " <P> With that , federal officials wheeled vans to the doors , unloaded portable computers and typewriters and fanned across the bank 's five floors , counting cash in the vault , poring over spread sheets and answering the ringing phones with " FDIC . " In the executive suite , Secretary Debbie Bratton watched in disbelief as strangers carted off the Texas banking charter . Fretted New Accounts Representative Norma Villaloboz : " Everyone 's in shock . Hopefully , somebody will buy us out . " <P> At week 's end a rescuer appeared . The American Bank , a smaller institution two blocks away , agreed to acquire the insured deposits of Unitedbank and buy some of its good loans . As word spread that withdrawals could be made on Monday , worried depositors in the lobby broke into wide grins.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
