All forms of human services have been under attack for two major reasons : increased bureaucratization and the cost of human labor . While both factors led to Reaganomics , this year ' s budget cuts will only make matters worse. // Consider first bureaucracy . Reagan ' s instinctive dislike for large-scale impersonal organization of human services is far more reasonable than his critics admit . The problem is that bureaucratization has taken over health and welfare not only in Washington , but in states and localities as well . Private charity is now dominated by national organizations using computerized mailings . Even at the local level , many agencies dare not exercise initiative for fear of conflicting with United Way regulations. // The second cause undermining human services is the cost of labor . While inflation has ravaged the dollar , its effects on health and welfare have been particularly pronounced . Today , you need $3. 56 to buy consumer durables that cost $1 in 1929 . For services , however , the comparable figure is $5. 71 . Where labor is the principal factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus grown at 1. 6 times the rate of durable goods like refrigerators and cars. // Since 1961 , while a pound of ground meat has gone from 79 cents to $1. 79 , a day in the local hospital has increased in cost almost 9 times ( from $49 to $439 ) . It now costs more than $35 , 000 a year for a place at New Hampshire ' s Youth Development Center . And when it can be said that the state reformatory is more expensive than Harvard , outcry over the cost of publicly funded human services is hardly surprising. // Reaganomics doesn ' t touch the deep causes of the increased cost of human services . While Reagan seeks to reduce the bureaucratization in Washington , equally important ravages have occurred at the state level and in the private sector . Hence cutting back the federal budget for health and welfare without finding a viable alternative could well have devastating effects. // What can be done ? // Voters from coast to coast have rebelled against tax-supported human services . But the budget axe won ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sound , there is much to be said for a return to local charity as a major means of funding health , welfare , and human services. // Speaking to the National Alliance of Business recently , the President reiterated that ' ' this administration seeks to elevate voluntary action and private initiative to the recognition they deserve . ' ' Many liberals scoff . But perhaps frustrated supporters of human services should give this suggestion serious consideration. // As an example , consider the problem of teen-agers in trouble . Reform schools like New Hampshire ' s Youth Development Center are clearly necessary as a last resort , but budget cuts have dramatically increased the cost per inmate . State social workers and school guidance counselors are typically overworked and often unable to offer extensive assistance before difficulties of adjustment become criminal cases . In our local area , however , a private agency has demonstrated that small charitable organizations can make a difference. // The example is worth describing . Upper Valley Youth Services was founded in 1978 . With a total staff of nine and an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for teen-agers who can not continue to live with their parents , sponsors a family group home , and provides counseling to prevent placement if possible . It costs half as much to place a child in the agency ' s foster homes as in a public institution , not counting the benefits of other counseling and support services provided by UVYS. // Funding is catch-as-catch-can . Started with Law Enforcement Assistance Administration seed money from Washington , the agency has negotiated separate contracts with New Hampshire and Vermont to reimburse it partially for services to teen-agers in placement . The local United Way provides about 5 percent of the budget , and as much as $19 , 000 has been added by an imaginative ' ' Christmas in October ' ' fund-raiser . But even with energetic local effort , the agency has to date received about 70 percent of its budget from federal or state governments. // Here is an example of high-quality social service with low overhead . State welfare agencies , judges , and other professionals have relied on UVYS for assistance in placing hard-to-handle teen-agers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different welfare offices , judicial systems , and school administrators on both sides of the Connecticut River . Yet troubled youths are provided a supportive environment in local placement at much less than the cost of a state-run institution. // Local organizations like UVYS can make a real difference on the human level with a minimum of bureaucracy . They provide room for initiative yet remain close to community needs and attitudes . And , alas , they are going out of business. // Although successful to date , UVYS only has operating funds through February 1982 . As government money has dried up , alternative sources must be found . So far , extensive efforts by the board , staff , and concerned citizens have not been successful . Nor can such a small organization hope to compete with nationally known charities with their mass mailings and prestigious letterheads. // In a fundamental sense , this case illustrates a test of Reagan ' s policies that is every bit as critical as Wall Street ' s response to economic uncertainty . If local service agencies like UVYS go under , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The package of tax cuts and reduced budgets was intended to stimulate business investment . But unless it also generates radically increased contributions to local human service agencies , Reaganomics will produce both individual misery and nasty political backlash . In the long run , failure to meet genuine human needs will lead to demands for a more bureaucratic and all-encompassing welfare state than the US has ever known. // //
