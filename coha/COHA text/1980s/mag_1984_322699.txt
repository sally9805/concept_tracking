Perhaps the most tangled case of 1984 Olympic eligibility is that of a tiny teenager , 5-ft. 2-in. , 82-lb . Zola Budd . The 17-year-old may be the fastest female middle-distance runner in the world , but she is having a tough time proving it officially . The reason : she is a white South African as well as a hastily minted British citizen . And that quick switch strikes some as too fast altogether . <P> The farm girl emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in a race near Cape Town last January . Striding barefoot , as she prefers , over the artificial Tartan , Budd ran the 5,000 meters in an amazing 15:01.83 , shaving nearly 7 sec. from Mary Decker 's world-record time . Although she runs with an unearthly determination-like " safari ants on the march , " says her full-time coach , Pieter Labuschagne-her feat remains unofficial . The International Amateur Athletic Federation ousted South Africa in 1976 for its apartheid policies ; the country is also banned from the Olympics . <P> Some South African athletes , white and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Olympic Hopeful Sydney Maree , for instance , will become a U.S. citizen next week ; the Villanova track star married an American 3 years ago . Budd took a different course . Her father Frank is the grandson of an Englishman , entitling her to British citizenship . As part of a secret deal struck by Frank Budd , Labuschagne and London 's Daily Mail , the family was flown to England last month . For a reported $300,000 trust fund and living expenses , the Mail has exclusive rights to Zola 's story . " British blood runs in her veins , " puffed one of its editorials . <P> Many debate the point . Noting that Budd got her citizenship papers in a matter of weeks while others have been waiting up to two years , the Times of London observed primly that in England " queue jumping is frowned upon . " There are other critics . After setting a British junior record against an undistinguished field last week , Budd was pressured to withdraw from a tune-up race last Saturday in Sussex because officials said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 middle-distance runner , says of her new competitor : " When our flag goes up and they play the national anthem , would she feel she had won for Britain or South Africa ? " Like those safari ants , Budd is pressing on . She has next to hurdle the I.O.C. eligibility rule requiring three years ' residency . Exceptions have been made in the past , notes Sir Arthur Gold of the British Amateur Athletic Association , who will argue her case this week . Sir Arthur is not even sure he wants to win , however . Says he : " If the committee says yes , the Third World will attack us for trying to get in through the side door . "
