It is 1 p.m. on April Fool 's eve , and 2,000 of the faithful have filed into &lt; the sold-out Tupperware Convention Center in Kissimmee , Fla . On the lawn outside stands a light infantry of pickup trucks ; one bumper sign reads GOD GUNS AND GUTS MADE AMERICA  --  LET 'S KEEP ALL THREE . Inside , an army of tattoos comes to attention as the houselights fall , the speakers blare That 's Entertainment , and the giant screen flashes the words LIVE FROM MADISON SQUARE GARDEN : WRESTLEMANIA . The magic moment has arrived . And so , for the moment , has the bastard sport of pro wrestling . From glittery Manhattan ( where some aficionados were offering $200 for a good seat ) to good-ole-boy Kissimmee , in closed-circuit auditoriums in the U.S. and 26 foreign countries , wrestling fans of all collars are savoring the triumph of hype , hell raising and Hulk Hogan . They made America ; let 's buy all three . <P> Only pro wrestling , as perpetrated by Vince McMahon 's World Wrestling Federation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleaze . WrestleMania 's guest referee is Muhammad Ali ; the guest ring announcer is Battlin ' Billy Martin ; the guest timekeeper , manipulating a tiny silver bell that might have come from King Farouk 's dinner table , is Liberace . Pop Thrush Cyndi Lauper is " managing " Wendi Richter ( " 150 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal " ) as she attempts to regain her W.W.F. championship belt from zaftig Leilani Kai , managed by former longtime ( 28 years ) women 's champ , the Fabulous Moolah . And in the main event , teaming with Hulk Hogan against the preening Paul ( " Mr. Wonderful " ) Orndorff and the kilted , malefic Rowdy Roddy Piper , is the Hulk 's Rocky III co-star , Mr. T. <P> WrestleMania ? The term is an understatement for an attraction now enjoying its biggest boom ever . Four wrestling shows , all produced by the W.W.F. , are among the top ten programs on cable TV . NBC will present Saturday Night 's Main Event , the pilot for a possible monthly series , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including one on the Hulkster , are scheduled to hit the stores next month . There are Hulk Hogan action dolls , T shirts and sweatbands . Propelled by Hogan and Lauper , who last year brought her rock-'em sock-'em glamour to the " sport , " wrestling has moved from the regional sideshows of trash sports to the national big top . <P> For any connoisseur of the deadpan schlock of pop culture , pro wrestling in its latest guise is like a trip to hog heaven . And the crowd is a big part of the show : part upscale , part down-home . Tuxedoed yuppies mix gingerly with the + rip-his-eyes-out ! regulars . Andy Warhol shows up to pronounce , " It 's hip . It 's exciting . It 's America . " Gloria Steinem stops by to snort , of woman- mauling Roddy Piper , " He certainly is unfit to wear a skirt . " Geraldine Ferraro apostrophizes , " Roddy Piper , why do n't you come out and fight like a man ? " Meanwhile , each month at the Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jane Fonda Workout congregate to scream obscenities and pelt the wrestlers with hot dogs and ice cubes . For the few hours they spend together in a wrestling arena , the Perrier Set and the Boilermaker Brigade have something in common : synthetic blood lust .
