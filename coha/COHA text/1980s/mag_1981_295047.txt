Simulated launch , real death <P> NASA officials had one word for the simulated launch of the space shuttle at Cape Canaveral last week : " Super ! " Then disaster struck . For reasons yet to be explained , five Rockwell International technicians removed an access panel and entered a rear section of the orbiter above the engine . A few minutes later , they began keeling over from lack of oxygen . One technician , John Bjornstad , 50 , died in a helicopter en route to a hospital , and another , Forrest Cole , was in critical condition . <P> The reason for the mishap may not be known until NASA and Rockwell officials complete their separate investigations . Yet some of the circumstances are already known . Apparently , safety supervisors erred in clearing the technicians to go into the craft . Before a launch rehearsal , it is standard procedure to use nonflammable nitrogen to flush oxygen-laden air out of the engine compartment , where even the slightest friction or electrical spark can touch off a deadly fire . Afterward , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shuttle , went into the nitrogen-saturated compartment without their air packs , the portable breathing systems used in hazardous atmospheres . Since nitrogen can neither be seen nor smelled , the five technicians were overcome before they were aware of the danger . <P> A sixth technician discovered the mishap and called a security guard , who donned a breathing apparatus that enabled him to drag the five from the compartment . An ambulance speeding to pad 39-A reportedly was delayed by security men . <P> Despite the accident , the space shuttle is still scheduled for launch next month , pending a successful test of its fuel tank . The shuttle has been plagued by technical troubles during its development over the past decade and is two years behind schedule . Last week 's tragedy was the first loss of life at the launch site of a manned space flight since three astronauts died in a capsule fire in the Apollo I spacecraft in 1967. ?
