THE PARSIFAL MOSAIC by Robert Ludlum <P> Random House ; 630 pages ; $15.95 <P> " My books are known , " confides the trench-coated star of a new American Express television commercial , " but still my face remains a mystery . " Robert Ludlum goes on to reveal his " born identity , " a playful reference to the name of his last novel , but the charade is hardly necessary . From the dust jackets of his ten books and the rounds of TV talk-show appearances that accompany delivery of a new three-word title every other year or so , ex-Actor Ludlum has one of the best-known obscure faces in America . As for his name , it is powerful enough to drive his new thriller . The Parsifal Mosaic , to the crest of the bestseller list one week after publication . <P> Parsifal is the author 's longest novel so far ( more than 100 pages bulkier than The Bourne Identity ) , with the most complicated plot . As in most of his previous fiction , Ludlum is concerned with what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses his subject with unremitting intensity . His principal characters range from a pundit of Lippmannesque omniscience to a Strangelovean Secretary of State to the Man in the White House , and it is part of Ludlum 's murky artistry that almost no one at any point is unequivocally beyond suspicion . <P> One of the few unambiguous characters is Michael Havelock , n Mikhail Havlicek . The son of a Czech partisan , he goes to the U.S. as a child , amasses a brilliant academic record and becomes the protg of Secretary of State Anthony Matthias , also a Czech immigrant . After 16 years of successful undercover work as a State Department field agent , Havelock is driven almost to insanity by the supposed murder of his mistress , Jenna Karas , a fellow Czech and coworker . Was she a double agent ? Is she really dead ? Havelock sets out on a wild , independent attempt to unravel an international cabal that has led his own Government to mark him " beyond salvage " - to be eliminated at all costs . <P> On the convoluted trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of civilization . Its ingenious masterminds , some demented , some all too sane , have been plotting for decades . Absurd as it sounds . Ludlum makes his doomsday machine smoothly plausible , " a mix of a thousand moves in a triple-sided chess game . " From a sleazy Italian waterfront to the corridors and backwaters of power in Amsterdam , Rome , Athens , Paris and Manhattan-plus an important interlude in the Shenandoah Valley-Parsifal packs in as much gore and grue as geopolitics : Ludlum meticulously researches the loci and foci of his novels . He is somewhat less convincing with his love scenes , never a strong point of the Ludlum oeuvre . In Parsifal , the lovers ' conversations are conducted in Czech , which may be just as well . It 's the thought that counts . <P> - By Michael Demarest
