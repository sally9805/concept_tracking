Mainstream American museums have only just begun to accept that in contemporary American culture , there are many houses . Even today this recognition is not shared by everyone . But the situation has certainly improved since 1969 , when New York City 's Metropolitan Museum of Art mounted its hideously condescending exhibition " Harlem on My Mind . " Back then the Met confidently declared that spending $5,544,000 on Velazquez 's portrait of Juan de Pareja , his dark-skinned assistant of presumed Moorish ancestry , would improve the self-esteem of the museum 's black and Hispanic public . <P> $ Institutions such as the long-established Museo del Barrio and the newer Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art in New York City have worked hard ( heroically , even , considering the difficulty of funding ) to set the work of Hispanic-American artists before the public . And yet there is still a gap , caused by a pervasive institutional nervousness about how to deal with minority culture while maintaining the ideal of purely aesthetic standards . For ethnic art repeats the problems posed for museums by women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When most non-Spanish speaking Americans hear the words Hispanic art , they think of the Chicano murals in Los Angeles in the ' 70s and early ' 80s , noble if garish campesinos brandishing their fists from the concrete walls of storm drains . In fact , some remarkably interesting artists were involved with the Chicano-mural movement . Among them were " Los Four " in Los Angeles : Carlos Almaraz , Gilbert Lujan , Frank Romero and Beto de la Rocha . But to suppose that this was the main form of Hispanic expression is rather like imagining that Judy Chicago 's The Dinner Party is the chief work of art produced by an American woman . <P> America has no shortage of first-rate Hispanic artists who work out of deep convictions about , and connections to , their Latin heritage  --  artistic , religious and ideological . There are also mediocre ones who use their ethnicity as a lever to induce guilt in curators , if not dealers ( who by now are guiltproof ) . But quite a few excellent painters and sculptors who happen to be Hispanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ghettoization . And some of the best , such as the sculptors Robert Graham and Manuel Neri , are virtually invisible  --  or are not widely thought of as Hispanic at all . <P> The path of the curator who would mount a serious survey of current Hispanic art is therefore rocky , steep and strewn with thorns . And yet it is unthinkable that serious attempts should not be made . Hence the interest of " Hispanic Art in the United States : Thirty Contemporary Painters and Sculptors , " a show of some 180 works that has been on view jointly at the University of Miami 's Lowe Art Museum and the Metropolitan Museum and Art Center in Coral Gables , Fla . Curated by Jane Livingston and John Beardsley , the exhibit has already been seen in Houston and Washington ; after Miami , through September 1989 , it will travel to Santa Fe , Los Angeles and New York City . It is by far the most detailed and serious effort ever made to survey the current painting and sculpture of Hispanic Americans .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
