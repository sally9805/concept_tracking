THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IETTER from a friend who is an admirer of Paul ( Bear ) Bryant , J the great University of Alabama football coach , who died last month : I met Bear Bryant twice . The first time was at a dinner , where he said a few words introducing the then president of the University of Alabama  --  a man whom people were calling " the Republican jimmy Carter . " ( This was in 1977 . ) Bryant was wearing a white belt and white shoes , and he made them seem like the only accessories a distinguished man would want to wear . When I shook his huge hand , his eyes were way hack in his head  --  sleepy , remote . I decided he had taken an instant dislike to me , but now I think that maybe he was n't completely happy to find himself in the entourage of " the Republican Jimmy Carter " and so far from anything having to do with the furtherance of the University of Alabama football team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York for an awards ceremony sponsored by a car-rental company to honor outstanding high-school athletes , and I waited for several hours with many other reporters who wanted to interview him . The waiting began in the lobby of the hotel where Bryant was staying ; the reporters meandered around in a holding pattern until a press agent came and took them by ones and twos up in the elevator . When they stepped off the elevator , the reporters found themselves in a line that stretched down the corridor , through the door of Bryant 's suite , and right up to the chair where the interviewer was supposed to sit . The front end of the line was so close to the interview site that I was able to hear all the questions the five guys ahead of me asked  --  questions like " Coach , how would you rate your conference , the Southeastern Conference , in comparison with the Big Tent " and " Bear , which do you think is the tougher conference  --  the Big Eight or the Pac Ten ? " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they choose the teams for the Sugar Bowl ? " and " Coach , do you think there should he a bowl game set up to decide the national college championship every year ? " and " Bear , do you think the system of balloting for the Reisman Trophy should be changed ? " Bryant answered all the questions easily , as if he were performing a boring but basically healthful exercise , like jumping jacks . I had spent the previous evening rereading his autobiography , " Bear : The Hard Life and Good Times of Alabama 's Coach Bryant , " and when my turn came I asked some questions taken from that . The first one was about the time Alabama went out to play in the Rose Bowl in 1938 , when he was an assistant coach of the Alabama football team , and a big motion-picture studio gave him a screen test . He gave me a look before he answered . " How 'd you know about that ? " he said . His eyes were a washed-out blue , with lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I asked him to tell me about the first time he met Ronald Reagan , when Reagan was a cub sports reporter and interviewed him . Again , he gave me a look . Next , I asked how he felt when he arrived at College Station in Texas to take over the coaching job at Texas A &; M , and , to impress the Aggies  --  the Texas A &; M students  --  who had come to welcome him , he took off his coat and threw it on the platform and stomped on it , and , when that drew a big cheer , took off his tie and threw that on the ground and stomped on it , and the Aggies went wild . " Damn , how do you know all that stuff ? " he said . I told him I had read his book . " I did n't know I said all that in my book , " he said . His answers were long . Each reporter was allotted only seven minutes , but Bryant was still going strong twenty-five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line were pickled in impatience . The press agent was abstracted , rehearsing for his inner ear tones that one might use to interrupt the great Bear in a spiel . Because he had to do with football , a sport that many people think is sloppy and stupid and painful , and because he often appeared on TV next to the snow-tire ads , and because he was the subject of so many identical sports articles , containing so many identical phrases , Bear Bryant 's actual genius was often invisible . Bryant was not just " Coach ; " he was a coach . That is , he was a teacher . He saw what people had inside them , what made them do what they did . He paid attention to what they cared about and did n't care about . He always took pains to thank " all the daddies and mornmas and high-school coaches and preachers and high-school counsellors and girlfriends " of the boys who played for him . Decades of seeing where his players ' deepest intentions came from helped him compile that list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention he gave was that his players use what they had that was good to some positive effect . To him , that meant winning  --  which is still a good idea , no matter how many hard-chargers may expropriate it . Not unlike a farmer seeing what beautiful plants a soil will grow , he elicited courage and strength from thousands of people in his life . He spent his entire career , until his retirement last December , coaching college teams ; he was too much a teacher to leave college for the pros ( something he could have done any time Ile wanted ) . And he was so much a coach that when he stopped being a coach he stopped being . When I heard on the radio that he had died , and I started to cry , I knew I was just part of a big chorus . ? ? The Camera Looking " T HERE are at least 100 ways to get to The Cathedral Shop at St. John the Divine , " reads the caption under a bus poster that shows Philippe Petit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of a cable stretched high above the street . Nervy undertakings of a different but related sort were in progress at St. John 's last week , more or less on the ground , as Merce Cunningham and his dance company prepared to film a new dance there called " Coast Zone . " Cunningham , the most advenFEBRUARY 14 , 1983 turous choreographer of our time , has been experimenting for several years with dances that he creates specifically for film or videotape . His ambition has been to make dances designed for the camera , with its benefits and its limitations kept firmly in mind . Learning that he was at work on a new one , we went up to Amsterdam Avenue and 110th Street to take a look . The company was assembled in the great hall of the Synod House , a long , oak-panelled room in a building just south of the main cathedral . Charles Atlas , the filmmaker who collaborates with Cunningham on these projects , had found out about it after an extended search  --  Cunningham wanted a larger space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hall was big enough , with a high ceiling , and it was not too costly to rent . The company had been rehearsing and shooting there for three weeks . ( It had rehearsed for three weeks before that at Westbeth . ) As we arrived , four of the fifteen dancers in the company were in action , bending and swooping , then running toward the far end of the ball , closely followed by a cameraman on a dolly propelled by four perspiring stagehands . Cunningham and Atlas were behind the dolly , moving with it and observing the action . A small video monitor was mounted on the dolly , just behind the cameraman , so that they could see the action two ways  --  live and on the screen . When the brief sequence ended , the dancers and the camera crew came back toward our end of the room and did it again . This happened five or six times before they went on to the next sequence . Taking a quick break between the two , Cunningham came over to say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a gray sweatsuit , black dancing shoes , and thick white socks , and he looked , as he always does , friendly and quizzical and alert . " It 's exhausting , all this starting and stopTHE NEW YORKER ping , " he said . " Much worse than a stage rehearsal . My idea about technology used to be that it lets you do all sorts of things at the same time , but it does n't work out that way . You just do the same thing over and over , and wait endlessly while they adjust the camera . You have all this marvellous equipment , but you 're always having to kick it along , or put masking tape on it , or find a piece of wood to use as a wedge . " For the next half hour , Cunningham and the dancers worked on two more short , fifteen-to-twenty-second dance phrases . After that , he asked for a complete run-through of the dance , without the camera . It looked immensely complex to us , with a great deal of rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be very young , and several of whom appeared to be having an awfully good time . Cunningham had not given himself a part in this dance . At the age of sixty-three , he does not dance as much as he used to , although the movements he makes for himself these days are as quirky and as fascinating as any he has shown us in the past . He watched the run-through from the sidelines , and when it was finished he came over again for a Few minutes ' conversation . " One of the things I 'm trying to do with this piece is to work in layers , " he said . " We 're using a lot of closeups  --  something we have n't done before  --  and mixing them with middle and long shots . The image on camera changes quite radically when you go from a distant shot to a closeup . As the camera moves toward the dancer , there is a very gradual enlargement of the image , but then , all of a sudden , it gets very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only moving cameras  --  no fixed angles , and no zoom-lens shots . The camera keeps moving in and out , changing the space . On that one sequence we were working on when you came in , the camera does a **29;6823;TOOLONG turn  --  is that right ? A complete circle and a half , anyway . It also changes speed during the turn , going faster and faster at the end . " We asked whether the new dance was n't unusually complicated , and he agreed that it was . " Mainly because everything is moving , " he said . " But nobody ever seems to he moving in the same direction as anybody else . I 've had to figure out new ways to tell the dancers where to go . I ca n't say , Move downstage , ' or ' Go to stage right , ' because there is n't any stage . It 's like objects in space , with everything moving at a different rate of speed . We make marks on the floor to help orient the dancers , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What were some of the other problems of choreographing for the cam-era ? " It 's not just the space that 's different  --  it 's the time , too , " he said . " I think you see things faster on television than you do onstage . Something that lasts for five seconds onstage can he done in one second on camera , and that 's sufficient . It 's the same with repetition  --  you get the idea much faster on TV . If something repeats too often , you flip to another channel , In this dance , I 've varied the movement so there is constant change , and no repetition . But space is still the main problem . When you look at a stage , you see depth  --  a lot of space around people . The camera flattens everything out , and we have to find ways to compensate for that . It 's to get around the flattening-out problem that I 'm shooting in layers , with a lot of closeups  --  to differentiate the space and the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance performance onstage , of the kind you often see on TV , is that you lose the space . The camera ca n't get the whole stage in unless it 's placed very far back , and then you lose the dancers . With a work onstage , you as the spectator are always referring what you see to that large space . But the camera takes in only what it is able to take in , which is n't much . " Charles Atlas came over to discuss a technical point with Cunningham , and while they were talking a crew of workmen appeared at the back door of the hall with a huge crane-and-dolly apparatus , called a tulip crane , that would be used for high-angle camerawork during the next day 's shooting . One dancer wondered why it was called a tulip crane . Another suggested that it had been developed in Holland , to pick very tall , championship tulips . Atlas went to inspect it . " There really are a lot of problems , " Cunningham told us , a hit ruefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formality , a distance between the audience and the performer . Television works the other way . And the camera chooses what you look at , and that 's not how I 've worked in the past . I just tell myself , ' Well , that 's the camera looking , let 's see what I can do with that . ' " " Coast Zone " was being shot on regular movie film and then transferred to videotape . The company distributes its own filmed and videotaped dances , mainly for rental by colleges and universities , and there is a lively demand for them . The new dance would also be given its premiere , live , during the company 's two-week season of performances at the City Center in March . " I imagine it will look entirely different there , " Cunningham said . " I do n't mean better or worse . Just different . Years ago , you know , I thought a lot about Fred Astaire , how wonderful he had been , although I never saw him onstage  --  it was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . So I said , ' If he can do that , maybe we can . Why not ? ' " Ideal FIBASSY PICTURES gave a party at the Tavern-on-the-Green recent-ly , following the screening of a movie that features the Rolling Stones in concert . Ahmet Ertegun was there , Bill Graham was there , Mary McFadden was there , and so was a man who told a nervous woman , " You call me about business . 1 will call you to see if you are all right on an emotional basis , but I will never , ever call you about business . " Sam Holdsworth , the editor of the magazine Musician was there , and Keith Richards , looking strange and unearthly , the way he always does , was there with his father and his son Marlon , and so was a woman who looked at Keith with his son and said , " Keith is so devoted to Marlon . Until a few years ago , he used to dress up as Santa Claus for him . " Mick Jagger was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing collar , a black jacket , and a pastel striped four-in-hand , and he worked the room like a politician at a fund-raiser in his home-town district , bending now to this car , now to that , smiling across the room , and huddling at one table , then another . Sortie people told him they admired his performance in the film ; others asked for and received autographs ; still others found themselves completely unable to frame the simplest kind of sentence . A tall black woman too handsome to be a model , wearing a blue shirt and dark pants and carrying a clipboard , was there attempting to keep order among a throng of photographers lurking in a small chamber outside the banquet room . The photographers had been promised a " photo opportunity " with the four members of the Rolling Stones attending the party . ( As well as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards , Charlie Watts and Ron Wood were there . ) The photo opportunity was chaotic and brief , with as many pictures taken of the Rolling Stones in , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to document his entire life . During the photo opportunity , the tall black woman strode back and forth making remarks that were largely ignored ; " Everybody take a step back . ... Please , you 're too close .... Gentlemen , if you ca n't behave we 'll have to stop it . . . . Everybody , five steps . . . . Gentlemen , go somewhere else to resolve your disputes . I mean it .... I 'll get security . . . Gentlemen , you 're too close , please ! ... Get of the table .... Ralph , would you get securi-ty . " Guests  --  people associated in one way or another with the business of popular music  --  ate chateaubriand , veal piemontese , pasta carnevale , assorted cold poultry , fresh vegetables , salad , cheese , and fresh fruits dipped in chocolate . The Rolling Stones stayed just so long . Then bodyguards carrying coats appeared and escorted them swiftly to their car . A young man trailed after them saying , " Keith ! Keith ! We 're friends ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Herald Tribune thirty years ago come Valentine 's Day : Marilyn Joan Shaw is being married tomorrow . So is Marilyn Joan Shaw . They are two different girls who have the same name . Both are twenty-one , work in offices , met their husbands-to-be on blind dates . But they have never met each other and themselves were amazed at the coincidence of their marriages both coming on St. Valentine 's Day . Marilyn Joan , the daughter of Mrs. Maxine Shaw , will marry Stanley Joseph Salkeld , twenty-three , Alhambra , airman 2/c , recently returned from Korea . Marilyn Joan , daughter of Mrs. Cozette Shaw , is marrying Charles John O'Connor , twenty-nine , of Hollywood . Last week , we tried to track down " If only the artist were up to the atelier .

We asked her how it 's going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " She and Charles are fine . They have left Hollywood , where Charles once worked in the crew of " Hawaii Five-O , " and settled in a big house north of Malibu . " He 's a general contractor now , " she said .

" My son was voted M.V.P. ? that 's Most Valuable Payer  --  last year in the Hawaiian Invitational Water Polo Tournament for eighteen-year-olds and under , " she said . " And his team won a bronze medal , which I ca n't read without my glasses  --  that 's another change  --  for the Men 's Senior National Indoor Championships in Fort Lauderdale .

It was easy to remember the day , because it 's St. Valentine 's Day , but it was actually our twenty-fourth anniversary . Very embarrassing , but a great party all the same .
