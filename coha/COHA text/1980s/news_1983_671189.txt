The vandalism , which goes far beyond mischief , has been striking farms throughout New Jersey , the country ' s most urbanized state . The state ' s Agriculture Secretary , Arthur R. Brown , said that unless the havoc can be curbed , it could undermine New Jersey ' s efforts to retain agriculture in the state , particularly near housing developments. // New Jersey officials are uncertain why the destruction is occurring , but farmers say that most of it is done at night and that many of the vandals are teen-agers and young adults. // New York , Connecticut and other states , particularly near major population centers , report increases in vandalism , but only New Jersey has reached the point of compiling statistics . Governor Kean has formed the Committee on Trespass and Vandalism in October to propose solutions to the growing problem. // Legislation shaped by the committee would increase fines for trespassing to $100 from $20 , provide for full restitution for damages plus fines of up to $500 , make parents responsible for damages caused by any " infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license for any person damaging farm property with a motor vehicle . The measures are all before the Legislature. // " Vandalism is more intense in New Jersey than in less urbanized states , " Secretary Brown said . " It has been increasing from one end of the state to the other. " // He attributed some of the increase to the advent of four-wheel drive vehicles that give after-dark vandals the power to mow down corn and wheat and crush soybeans and young fruit trees. // " I don ' t understand why they do it , " he said . " I guess it ' s like a night out on the town . " Jonathan P. Repair , Rutgers University ' s Agricultural Extension Service agent for Mercer County , said damage from farm vandalism exceeded $1 million a year in New Jersey. // " There are about 1 , 000 incidences a year now , " Mr. Repair said . " Only 20 percent of the vandals are caught . Only half of those are prosecuted , because the laws are not strict enough to deter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by law and farmers have suffered retaliation if they prosecute. " // Mr. Repair is a member of the Governor ' s committee , which is headed by Secretary Brown . It also includes Attorney General Irwin I. Kimmelman , State Police Superintendent Clinton L. Pagano , legislators from farm districts in the north , central and southern sections of the state , farmers and others. // The wife of Robert A. Winner , a dairy farmer near Moorestown , said that " our farmer friends in western Pennsylvania are astounded at the extent of vandalism we have ; they have only nuisance vandalism . " <> <> Metal and Glass in Feed // She said someone had shot and killed one of their $1 , 500 cows . Six to 10 cows in their herd die every year , Mrs. Winner said , because vandals throw bottles and cans and other trash into their cornfields .

The animal ' s hindquarters and loin had been removed . Nathan Repair , Somerset County agricultural agent and the father of Jonathan Repair , said the incident was one of five to have occurred recently in Somerset. // Another farmer , Douglas Vogel , said vandals had attached a chain to their four-wheel drive vehicle and pulled open a sluice gate , draining his cranberry bog in Lacey Township in Burlington County and ruining the $15 , 000 crop. // In Ocean County , Martin Dwulet of Lakewood , a truck farmer who uses irrigation to water his vegetables , said vandals had " cut every hydraulic hose and smashed all the gauges " to ruin his $10 , 000 irrigation pump. " // He said he was reluctant to prosecute , even when vandals could be caught . <> <> Threats From the Vandals // " The kids say we ' re going to burn you out , " he said .

Equipment is ordinarily left in a field being harvested , because combines are too wide to be moved legally over roads at night. // Upon returning in the morning to finish the harvest , Mr. Kilbourn found all four drive belts cut , all electrical and hydraulic lines cut and the chain and lock on the engine smashed . He could not resume harvesting until he had made repairs that took a week and cost $1 , 300. // " It ' s very discouraging to farmers who work the fields all year only to lose much of the crop , " said William E. Kenny , the state assistant secretary of agriculture . " The farmer gets only one shot a year at a harvest and it has to be done on time . We are getting more and more complaints , the most serious ones in places where there has been urban encroachment . It appears to be people who come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <> <> The Dangers of Confrontation // Police forces in rural townships are too small to stake out farm fields , so farmers go " nighthawking , " as John I. Rigolizzo of Berlin in Camden County put it . But confrontation with vandals can be dangerous . Mr. Winner was nearly run over by a four-wheel drive truck when the vandal who had been tearing swaths through six-foot-high corn saw his way out blocked. // Last summer Steven Niederer did get run over . He still has the tire marks from the three-wheeled Honda motorcycle to show for it . " He was fishtailing through my soybean field , " Mr. Niederer said . " I tried to block the road so he couldn ' t escape . He knocked me down and left this 10-inch-wide tire track down the back of my shirt . My wife was 100 feet away and he nearly ran her over too. " // Occasionally , vandalism is done in daylight , and the police can be alerted while the maurauders are still in the fields .

" But the joy riders raised so much dust , the police couldn ' t see . The motorcycles peeled off and escaped through trees where the cars couldn ' t go. " // His farm is between two housing developments . Once he caught some boys stealing peaches and ordered them off the property . In retaliation , he said , they buried boards with nails pointing up in one of his farm roadways and he promptly got four flat tires on his truck. // He said crops had been maliciously destroyed .

The vandals " fishtailed and drag-raced their way through the field , " he said . " They left wide tracks over mashed soybeans . We didn ' t harvest 10 per cent of the crop. " // Many farmers have tried to fence off their fields , to no avail . " I put up a $3 , 000 fence of snow-fencing and posts , " said Fred T. Moriuchi , who has 600 acres in apples and peaches in Burlington County . " They took four-wheel drives and rammed right through it . Adults bring their kids to help them steal the fruit . The cars we chase away range from pick-ups to Mercedes. " // Fences stay intact no longer than a day , Mr. Rigolizzo said . " We tried reinforcing ours with chain-link fencing , " he said .
