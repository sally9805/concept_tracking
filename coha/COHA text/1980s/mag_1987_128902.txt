The starting lineups are set at the Astrodome . The Houston Cougars send out Don Chaney , George Reynolds , Ken Spain , Theodis Lee and the Big E , Elvin Hayes . The UCLA Bruins will defend their No. 1 ranking with Lucius Allen and Mike Warren in the backcourt , Lynn Shackelford and Edgar Lacey as the forwards and , of course , Lew Alcindor in the middle . The Game of the Century is about to begin . // But it is n't Jan. 20 , 1968 , it 's 1987 . The arena is n't the Astrodome , it 's an IBM Personal Computer . And the players are on hand thanks to Hoops , an ingenious basketball simulation game produced by two MIT-trained mathematicians and an Indiana University computer scientist . The statistics and characteristics of 220 of the top college teams from the past , ranging from the 1950 CCNY squad ( the only team to win both the NCAA and NIT titles in the same season ) to 43 of the best teams from 1986 , have been encoded on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the program every year . // Hoops is extremely sophisticated yet marvelously easy to play . As coach you decide which team to play , which players to start , when to substitute and what strategy to use . Each player is rated according to his ability to score , play defense , rebound , stay out of foul trouble , handle the ball and draw fouls . A team can play a man-to-man or zone defense with varying intensities : safe ( to stay out of foul trouble ) , tight , or press ( to force more turnovers at the risk of fouling more ) . In a man-to-man you decide who guards whom . On offense you can choose between normal , semistall , stall or hurry-up . To satisfy Rollie Massimino wannabees yearning to rant on the sidelines , strategies may be changed while the game is in progress , the computer equivalent of yelling instructions from the bench . You can replay past NCAA championships and second-guess at will . In the 1977 final would you , like Dean Smith , put your North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stretch against Marquette ? Would you give Houston forward Larry Micheaux more second-half playing time against N.C. State in the ' 83 final ? Hoops is an armchair coach 's paradise . // The game is the brainchild of Jeff Sagarin , 38 , and Wayne Winston , 37 , two basketball fanatics who also happen to be graduates of MIT . Although Winston had played sports simulation games  --  involving printed player cards , dice and charts  --  he never found a basketball game that satisfied him . So , while he was working on a Ph.D . in operations research at Yale , he invented a tabletop dice game . " It was statistically accurate but incredibly boring , " Winston remembers . " It took about two and a half hours to play . " He shelved the idea until his friend Sagarin , who rates college football and basketball teams by computer for several newspapers , including USA Today , bought a PC in 1985 . " Wayne , remember your boring basketball game ? " Sagarin asked Winston . " I bet it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a try . // Winston , now a business school professor at Indiana , supplied the mathematical model , while Sagarin figured out how to adjust raw statistics and strength of schedule so that a team with gaudy stats accumulated against weak opposition  --  like the ' 77 UNLV team that averaged 107 points per game  --  would n't be inordinately strong . They enlisted Jim Klopfenstein , then a grad student at Indiana , to translate the formulas into software . Television analyst Billy Packer agreed to supply defensive ratings , augmenting his own expertise with opinions from coaches , players and other experts past and present . The computer did the rest . // What makes an accurate card-and-dice basketball game so dull is the number of times one must roll the dice to make something happen . The Hoops program has the PC generate random numbers  --  the silicon equivalent of rolling the dice  --  five times for every : 01 of game action . " How would you like to play a board game if you had to roll the dice five times a second ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuthouse. " // You may get there yet , but your affliction will be a Hoops addiction . Klopfenstein 's inviting screen display makes the game easy to follow and play . Lines of text describe a running play-by-play , while statistics register on a scoreboard and a self-updating box score . Electronic crib notes remind you what keys to hit to make strategy changes or to call up a box score . Genuine basketball fans will be quickly smitten . Basketball fans used to playing sports strategy games may never be seen again . Hoops is that good . // In that ' 68 Game of the Century , Elvin Hayes scored 39 points and grabbed 15 rebounds , and Houston had 20 turnovers and UCLA had 16 as the Cougars broke the Bruins ' 47-game winning streak with a 71-69 upset . In a recent Hoops replay , Elvin Hayes scored 39 points and grabbed 15 rebounds , and Houston had 20 turnovers and UCLA had 16 . Honest to goodness . There are witnesses . Only this time the ' 68 Bruins , the highest-rated of the 220 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two real flaws in the game , one strategic and the other aesthetic . Players do n't get tired , so their effectiveness never diminishes . The creators assure us that this problem is already being rectified , and the revised game will be available soon . ( Those who already own Hoops will be offered an upgraded version at a discount . ) The other problem is that the play-by-play is not entirely tailored to individuals . When a good rebounder shoots , the program assumes he plays inside and is therefore more likely to have taken an inside shot . The type of an inside shot is randomly chosen . Thus , in a game featuring the ' 65 Princeton team , for which Bill Bradley averaged 11.8 rebounds per game , you 're likely to see BRADLEY DRIVES AND STUFFS . Do n't worry , your computer is n't going haywire . Just smile and pretend the shot is a layup. // Yet , considering how ingenious and generally realistic the game is , even the purist roundball maven can forgive the idea of Bradley jamming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist as an open 15-foot jumper . // Hoops sells for $49.95 and may be obtained by writing to Hoops , P.O.
