This attractive East African equatorial country could hardly have sunk lower than the point it reached after nine years of Idi Amin ' s tyranny . But it did not remain trapped in the malaise , poverty , corruption , and disregard for human life that have disfigured many societies passing through experiences similar to Uganda ' s. // The outlook has shifted in the two years since Dr. Milton Obote , the leader ousted by Amin , has been back in the presidency. // The country still has a long way to go before it regains its former distinction of being one of the best-run and best-off countries in the continent , with an academic tradition and with other hallmarks of a vigorous open society . Yet none of this seems beyond President Obote ' s reach - provided he ends political terrorism and establishes a more broadly based national government. // When Dr. Obote won the national elections in 1981 , an independent Commonwealth team of observers reported that they were as fair as could be expected under prevailing conditions . But two sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reconciled to the loss of the hegemonic role their kingdom played before independence , and the other by radicals - took up arms rather than accept defeat . This perpetuated the state of violence and killing of the Amin years. // Obote faced this armed political challenge ( along with that offered by the remnants of Amin ' s army ) with an army that was hastily assembled , had few trained officers , was poorly paid and ill-disciplined. // But the army is now whipped into shape . The villagers - especially in Buganda - have begun to turn against the political gunmen they had previously sheltered . The results are that violence has decreased , and the armed resistance is on the defensive . Resistance appears to be confined to only three of the 52 districts , and more than 95 percent of the country seems once again to be enjoying tranquil conditions such as it has not known for a decade. // The only armed opposition that still gives cause for serious concern is that led by the self-professed radical Yoweri Museveni , whose force of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of Buganda. // Notwithstanding the initial period of insecurity that followed Obote ' s return to power , the President ' s policies have gone far toward restoring the country ' s economy . These policies are quite different from the socialism Obote espoused when he was previously in office . He has become a disciple of free market forces , avoiding controls where possible , and paying farmers relatively high prices for their produce. // Unlike many other third-world leaders , he has established a harmonious relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , which , along with the European Economic Community and the British government , are strongly backing him. // Uganda - a food-deficient country two years ago - will this year actually export grains to its neighbors . It has increased its sales of coffee , all of which is now handled through legal channels . Earlier , 95 percent of Ugandan coffee was sold on the black market. // Tea exports have resumed ; tobacco is being grown ; cotton sales have risen fourfold since 1981 ; and the once-flourishing sugar industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mining of copper and cobalt has been delayed because of Obote ' s concern to get the right partners and advantageous terms for the country. // Another innovation is a financial system through which foreign exchange is allocated through two so-called ' ' windows. ' ' // Every month a line forms outside ' ' window one , ' ' where funds are allocated only for national priority needs such as oil , machinery , and educational materials. // At the same time , a second line forms outside ' ' window two , ' ' where approximately one-fifth of the available foreign exchange is auctioned to the private sector and to citizens wishing to travel overseas . These funds are allocated to the highest bidder - and therefore are sold at a profit . Businessmen limit their bids to what they think will enable them to import goods and services at commercially viable prices. // When this reporter asked Obote about his sharp shift in economic policies , he replied that his policies in the 1960s and 1980s reflected the changed conditions in the country . In the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question was how to share it . Now the question is how to create wealth . Therefore , he said , the emphasis must be on productivity and on incentives to achieve it. // Obote ' s comments reflect his pragmatism . He is not an opportunist but a realist who , largely free of ideological hang-ups , is capable of deciding what policies are appropriate to particular situations. // Obote remains convinced of the value of maintaining a multiparty parliamentary system - an attitude increasingly rare among modern African nationalists . Even when faced with political violence , President Obote has allowed parliamentary opposition. // Contrary to much that has been written about him , Obote genuinely believes human rights must be observed . He cooperates with organizations like Amnesty International , even though he believes some of the group ' s reports have lacked impartiality. // Recently , when this reporter asked about conditions in Uganda ' s maximum-security prison , Obote allowed me to go where I pleased . On balance , I was impressed , although I did not visit any military interrogation centers. // Obote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the recent pogrom against Rwandan refugees , which was sparked off by local rivalries . What upsets him is what he regards as exaggerated reports about the extent of these abuses and , especially , the failure to pin the blame on political gunmen for creating the state of violence that leads to breaches of human rights. // In a part of the continent where the treatment of Asians is a touchstone of the treatment of minorities , Obote ' s leadership seems creditable . It would have been easy for him to accept as a fait accompli the expulsion of the 100 , 000 Asians by Amin and the expropriation of their property. // Yet , at a time when anti-Asian feeling is running particularly high in neighboring Kenya , he convinced Parliament to invite Asians entitled to Ugandan citizenship to return home , and to restore to them their former property and assets. // The numbers of Asians who are likely to return is not large - perhaps a few thousand . But the several hundred who have already come back speak warmly about their reception. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is making progress. // Among the positive signs in Uganda is a fairly free press . There is no real shortage of published information about injustices and inequities - some of it accurate , some of it exaggerated or invented. // Munnansi , a weekly political broadsheet that shows little restraint in its criticism , is eagerly read each week . There are few countries in Africa where a publication like Munnansi would be allowed to survive. // //
