In the 1840 ' s the word erythematosus ( from the Greek word erythema , meaning redness or flush ) was added to the name to distinguish the characteristic red rash of lupus from other skin disorders. // At the turn of the century Sir William Osler , the Canadian physician , added the adjective systemic ( involving the whole body ) to distinguish this sometimes devastating attack on organs throughout the body from forms of lupus limited to the skin. // Thus was born the name systemic lupus erythematosus , commonly called S.L.E. , or lupus for short . Until recently it was thought to be a rare and nearly always fatal disease . Now it is known that this chronic disorder of the immune system is common and is fatal much less frequently than previously thought . It afflicts about one in 500 women of childbearing age and a tenth that number of men , making it more common than multiple sclerosis , muscular dystrophy , leukemia and cystic fibrosis. // From 500 , 000 to 1 million Americans have lupus and 50 , 000 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first symptoms between the ages of 15 and 25. // Though no cure for lupus is known , thanks to a host of drug therapies and the ability to detect and intercept flare-ups before serious damage is done , the prognosis for most patients has improved . Eighty to 95 percent of lupus victims live at least 10 years after diagnosis , many experience only mild symptoms with infrequent flareups and some never have a recurrence after the initial attack subsides. // Even when symptoms wax and wane , many patients with lupus can live nearly normal lives , limited only by the confines of periodic treatment and the continual need to avoid circumstances that can trigger onsets. // The confusion about lupus arises largely because no two patients have precisely the same symptoms and because many symptoms are easily attributed to other disorders , including rheumatoid arthritis , dementia , psychosis , stroke , epilepsy , kidney disease , allergy and hypochondria. // Sometimes the disease is first picked up as a falsely positive premarital test for syphilis , which prompts a search for an explanation of the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of blood and urine tests that may sometimes take months to sort out . Suspected cases should be examined by a rheumatologist. // The basic problem in lupus involves damage to the body ' s connective tissues , which hold together and support cells . In lupus the connective tissues are attacked as a result of an error made by the immune system , which normally defends the body against foreign invaders. // Some experts think of lupus as an autoimmune disease in which the body launches an attack against its own tissues . Others say the attack is not deliberate ; rather , the damage results from a normal immune mechanism that has gone out of control . An overproduction of normal immunological substances causes inflammation and damages tissues in various parts of the body. // The symptom for which lupus was originally named - a butterflyshaped red rash across the bridge of the nose and cheeks - is found in only about 5 percent of newly diagnosed patients . Far more common are arthritic symptoms - painfully inflamed joints . Other symptoms may include weakness , lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight loss , sores in the mouth or vagina and increased susceptibility to infection. // Some lupus patients suffer from Raynaud ' s phenomenon - painfully cold fingers and toes caused by spasms of the small blood vessels in response to cold or intense emotions . Others get Sjogren ' s syndrome , a dryness of the mucous membranes throughout the body. // The membranes that surround the heart , lungs or abdominal organs may become inflamed . The gastrointestinal tract may also be involved . When the disease affects the cardiovascular system , it may mimic an arterial clot or rheumatic heart disease . An attack on the nerves may adversely affect sensations and movements ; the consequence of brain involvement may be misdiagnosed as a mental disorder . In severe cases lupus may attack the kidneys and lead to kidney failure , a common cause of death among lupus patients. // The disease may begin in any one of several organ systems and progress to others . However , many cases are mild and do not get worse . A closely related disorder , discoid lupus erythematosus , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is a much less serious disease. // There is a familial tendency to develop lupus , though it is not known whether this is due to a genetically inherited susceptibility or to exposure to the same environmental factors. // Sometimes a reversible form is caused by medications , among them a cardiac drug called procaineamide , the tetracycline and sulfonamide antibiotics , blood-pressure-lowering drugs and birth control pills containing estrogens. // Oregon researchers recently reported that a substance in alfalfa sprouts can , in large doses , cause a syndrome identical to lupus in monkeys . This may give researchers the first true animal model of the disease , allowing more detailed study of its cause and cure. // Currently , treatments are designed to suppress symptoms and relieve discomfort . Useful drugs include aspirin , nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents , corticosteroids , antimalarials and immunosuppressants . Most of these drugs have potentially serious side effects. // Also important is avoiding triggering factors that can cause a flare-up . As Dr. Michael D. Lockshin of Cornell University Medical Center commented in an article in the magazine Drug Therapy , this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a night with a rest period or nap during the day - and by distributing your work load so you don ' t do too much in one day . Whenever possible , avoid undue emotional and physical stress and physical injury . Prevent infections by avoiding crowds and people with infectious illnesses. // Many lupus patients are sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and must protect their skin from exposure to sunlight by wearing protective clothing , using sun screens and staying out of the midday sun . Check with your doctor before taking any drugs , prescription or over the counter . Many patients are sensitive to allergy-producing substances in hair colorings and cosmetics ; they should use only temporary hair rinses and hypoallergenic make-up. // Women with lupus can often have normal pregnancies and healthy babies but should discuss the matter with their doctors in advance . Pregnancy may precipitate a flare-up or worsening of the mother ' s symptoms. // Joanne F. White , a registered nurse from Duquesne University School of Nursing , emphasizes that patient education and family counseling about the disease can go a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The patient must accept the reality of having a chronic disease before needed life adjustments will be made , and family members must understand the patient ' s limitations , mood swings and need for assistance in daily chores. // Dr. Sheldon P. Blau , director of the division of rheumatic diseases at Nassau County Medical Center and co-author with Dodi Schultz of " Lupus : The Body Against Itself " ( Doubleday , 1977 ) , says that support from friends and family is vital to managing lupus. // He also stresses the importance of counseling on sexual matters , since many symptoms of lupus can inhibit sexual activity . He notes that half of married lupus patients get divorced , a figure he believes could be lowered by proper professional help. // The Lupus Foundation has more than 70 local chapters throughout the country that can help with medical referrals , educational materials and counseling .
