Four new-old volumes begin an American homecoming <P> Any good books lately ? Well , there is a hardback collection of Typee , Omoo and Mardi , all by a young novelist named Herman Melville ( 1819-91 ) . Nearly 33,000 copies have been printed , shipped and readied for sale . And that is not all . Three look-alike companions are also hot off the presses and speeding toward dealers : the complete poetry and prose of Walt Whitman ( 1819-92 ) , the tales and sketches of Nathaniel Hawthorne ( 1804-64 ) and three novels by Harriet Beecher Stowe ( 1811-96 ) . They will soon be available in U.S. bookstores , at $25 apiece . <P> Every publishing venture is a gamble , but this one seems a bigger flyer than most reissued works by 19th century American authors , offered at a late 20th century price . And the Library of America , the new publisher of these four new-old books , has already committed itself to a long roll of future bets . Next fall it will issue beginning collections of Mark Twain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London ; in a year , it promises another pair of books devoted to Melville and Hawthorne , plus two volumes of the writings of Historian Francis Parkman . The library lists 25 titles through the fall of 1984 . Its $1.8 million bankroll from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities may last just about that long . <P> The demiurge behind this outpouring of books is Critic Edmund Wilson , who died ten years too early to see it occur . During much of his long career , Wilson lobbied in print and in private for " the possibility of bringing out in a complete and compact form the principal American classics . " He particularly admired the French Pliade editions and wanted the work of U.S. authors similarly collected and displayed " in beautifully produced and admirably printed thin-paper volumes , ranging from 800 to 1,500 pages . " <P> The first four Library of America books fit this description . And the need for such volumes has only grown more urgent over the years . Two decades ago , readers could amass complete sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is no longer as cheap or as easy as it once was . Bookstores have ever less shelf space to give to slow-moving titles ; warehousing such items has become prohibitively expensive . Paperbacks blink in and out of print like fireflies . They also , as older collectors have ruefully discovered , fade and fall apart even more rapidly than their owners . <P> That will not happen to these books . They are printed on opaque , acid-free paper ; unlike most volumes published after 1840 , these will not slowly eat themselves up . Each one contains more than 1,300 pages , sewn together , not glued . Many uniform or limited editions try to stun with sheer size and ornate design , fancy letters marching across deserts of white space . Here , the money and care have gone into providing readable type , and plenty of it . These books are bound handsomely enough to grace any bookshelf ; more important , their size ( approximately 5 in. by 8 in. ) and weight ( about 2 lbs. ) make them easy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
