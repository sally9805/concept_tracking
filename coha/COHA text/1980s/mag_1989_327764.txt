The 6 a.m. phone call roused Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel from his sleep . It was a sobbing Imelda Marcos on the line with an urgent appeal from the hospital bedside of her husband , exiled former President Ferdinand Marcos . " The doctor told him he has n't much time to live , " she said to Laurel , pleading for permission for Marcos to return home so that he can die in his native land . After flying to Honolulu , where the Marcoses have lived since fleeing Manila in 1986 , Laurel visited the ailing ex-President and agreed that he appeared to be hovering near death . <P> But President Corazon Aquino , who has steadfastly refused to allow Marcos back into the country , did not budge . Despite Laurel 's bleak assessment of Marcos , who is ailing with congestive heart failure , pneumonia and bronchial asthma , Aquino said , " I do n't think he 's dying . " Aquino may have nothing to fear if Marcos returns home , but some believe Imelda might use the occasion to rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid ourselves for a moment , " wrote columnist Maximo Soliven in the pro-Aquino Philippine Star . " She 's raring for a comeback . "
