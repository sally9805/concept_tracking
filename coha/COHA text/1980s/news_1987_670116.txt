Despite the impasse at the Iceland summit , the Reagan administration is continuing to reciprocate Moscow ' s interest in establishing a detente-type relationship . Signs of this have included its intention to hold annual summit meetings , its offer of subsidized wheat ( rejected by Moscow , which is buying elsewhere ) , its expansion of trade , financial and cultural relations , and its backpedaling from the earlier , accurate linking of the Soviet Union to the terrorist assault on the West . Since the end of World War II there have been four previous efforts at establishing a cooperative relationship with the Soviet Union . These four detente-type eras account for about 13 of the 41 postwar years ( see table ) and offer some lessons for the current situation . The first effort at cooperation ( 1945-48 ) derived from the hope that the victorious Grand Alliance ( the U.S. , Britain and the Soviet Union ) would make the United Nations work for genuine peace . After Yalta , President Roosevelt told a joint session of Congress that " never before have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their war aims , but in their peace aims . " The U.S. rapidly reduced its six-million-strong armed forces in 1945 and 1946 , even though the Soviet Union did not disarm . Despite this and Stalin ' s violations of the Yalta agreements , President Truman continued efforts at cooperating with Moscow , stating in his October 1946 speech to the U.N. : " It is not necessary to exaggerate the differences ( among the Allies ) . . . . Above all , we must not permit differences in economic and social systems to stand in the way of peace . " A few weeks after Stalin ' s death in March 1953 , President Eisenhower publicly called for detente with Moscow , and Detente II began with the four-power foreign ministers ' conference in 1954 and continued with the Geneva summit of 1955 . The third , very ambiguous detente-type era can be dated from the Eisenhower-Khrushchev summit at Camp David in September 1959 . The Nixon-Brezhnev Moscow summit in May 1972 marked the start of Detente IV , which was continued by Presidents Ford and Carter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkable historical continuity . First , the Soviet Union or its partners made gains during each : During Detente I , for example , Stalin completed the communist takeover of Eastern Europe . The Vietnamese communists , with Soviet and Chinese help , won their nine-year-long war to conquer North Vietnam during Detente II , and Fidel Castro moved Cuba into the Soviet orbit during the third period . During Detente IV , nine new pro-Soviet dictatorships took power with Moscow ' s help . Second , the West continually overlooked or played down Soviet actions that were contrary to the assumptions of detente in an effort to prolong the mood of cooperation with the Soviet Union . Examples include : during Detente I , the Soviet attempt to seize northern Iran from 1944-46 ; and during Detente IV , Soviet support for the Yom Kippur surprise attack on Israel and Soviet efforts to bring communists to power in Portugal . Third , each detente era was terminated by a particularly ugly Soviet action : Detente I ended with the 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia and the Berlin blockade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Detente III with the Berlin Wall in 1961 , and Detente IV with the 1979 Afghanistan invasion . Fourth , virtually none of the detente-era agreements reached and signed with high hopes and solemnity had much positive impact . The exception was the 1955 treaty that led to Soviet withdrawal from a neutralized Austria . Otherwise , from Yalta in 1945 to the 1972 SALT agreements and to Helsinki in 1975 , these commitments were violated in whole or in part by the Soviet Union . The Reagan administration , in three public reports to the Congress , has documented Soviet violations of all the major arms-control agreements " over a period of 25 years "  --  including the treaty against germ warfare . Even within the terms of the agreements , the number of Soviet nuclear warheads on its 2 , 350 land- and sea-based ICBMs has increased from about 2 , 400 in 1972 , to about 8 , 900 today ( compared with 1 , 630 ICBMs and 7 , 500 warheads for the U.S. ) . The SALT agreements codified a continuing buildup ; it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four detente eras were times of more realistic relations with the Soviet Union : 1948-54 , 1957-59 , 1961-72 and 1980-85 . During these periods the U.S. and the West were much better at accomplishing the related goals of preserving freedom and nuclear peace . During the most recent realistic phase , which began in 1980 and lasted until the 1985 Geneva summit , no new pro-Soviet regimes were established and there were no serious military confrontations with the Soviet Union ( as in 1962 and 1973 ) . Furthermore , 200 million people in Latin America made peaceful transitions to democracy , and Grenada was liberated . Resistance fighters seeking to end six new illegitimate pro-Soviet dictatorships offered the free world a historic opportunity to help the peoples in these countries reverse the post-World War II history of communist victories through subversive aggression . Realism can include negotiations with the Soviet Union on all the major issues including the verified , mutual reduction of strategic and conventional forces . But all previous efforts at detente have failed badly . The lesson of history is clear : Peace and freedom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-deception and false hopes that have accompanied previous detente eras.  --  - Mr. Menges served President Reagan as a special assistant for national-security affairs from 1983-86 .
