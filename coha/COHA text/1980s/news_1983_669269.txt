But when Barbara Walzer began collecting antiquarian books and pamphlets about women , she discovered that a woman named Mary Hitchcock had made a treacherous hike through the Klondike in the 1890s , staking over 100 claims in the goldfields and later becoming a noted lecturer on the region . Another woman , an artist named Elizabeth Sarah Mazuchelli , carried her paints and canvas up the slopes of the Eastern Himalayas on a two-month trek , returning home to write ' ' The Indian Alps and How We Crossed Them , ' ' an illustrated account that was published in 1876. // In fact , as her collection grew , she acquired so many books , journals , letters , and other accounts of women who had done remarkable things that she listed them all in a catalog titled ' ' Women Adventurers . Explorers . Mountaineers . Artists . Printers . Scientists . Pamphleteers . Orators . Journalists . Eccentrics . Agitators . Hoboes . Spies . Anarchists . And more . . . ' ' The ' ' And more . . . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners and hats , posters , and other items that illustrate the changing status of women over the past two centuries. // Ms. Walzer ' s collection evolved during her work as an antiquarian bookseller in Cambridge , Mass. , her interest sparked by the wildly diverse lot of women in the little-known volumes she found gathering dust in attics and on the shelves of used bookstores . She found everything from books on the deportment of proper young ladies to romantic fiction to feminist and antifeminist tracts to the journals of women who had traversed the globe. // ' ' I was interested in collecting information on the lives of women that we don ' t know about , women who had managed to break away from the home and pioneer their way into all sorts of unladylike pursuits , ' ' she says . ' ' At first I was most intrigued with books by or about women explorers , those who had showed physical courage . Then the interest grew to include experimenters of all sorts. ' ' // Of the 400 or so books and pamphlets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accounts that date from the early 19th century on up to Arlene Blum ' s ' ' A Woman ' s Place Is on Top : The Story of the First All-Women ' s Himalayan Climb ' ' published in 1978 . One of her favorites is a 1935 book titled ' ' Women Called Wild , ' ' Rosita Forbe ' s account of her travels , during which she met notable women living in remote corners of the world . Among the biographical sketches in the book is a chapter on Alexandra David-Neel , a scholar who , wearing a disguise , slipped into the forbidden city of Llasa to research the lives of Tibetan monks. // Other books from the 1930s chronicle the adventures of women , some of them victims of the depression and from less lofty walks of life . One such is ' ' Sister of the Road , ' ' the biography of ' ' Boxcar Bertha , ' ' a woman who hopped freight trains and lived in the tent cities that had sprung up across the United States . An earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Female Tramp , ' ' the story of ' ' Hobo Nell ' ' who , according to the subtitle , ' ' traveled 500 , 000 miles for $7. 61. ' ' // Other titles in the collection - ' ' A Woman in the Sahara ' ' ( 1914 ) , ' ' I Ran Away to Sea at Fifty ' ' ( 1939 ) , ' ' The Trail of a Sourdough : Life in Alaska ' ' ( 1910 ) , ' ' A Sportswoman in India ' ' ( 1900 ) , ' ' The Call of the Snowy Hispar ' ' ( 1911 ) - are evocative testaments that women as well as men have long felt the call of faraway , even dangerous places . It was a discovery that Ms. Walzer found a little surprising. // ' ' I had had the impression that , until quite recently , women were nearly always domestic , ' ' she says . ' ' You certainly don ' t learn much in history class about women who explored the Amazon or scaled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women have been doing all sorts of interesting , unexpected things . And what I ' ve found is only a fraction of what has been written. ' ' // As she began collecting these little-known adventure books , she also stumbled across works of a more political nature that included some of the most famous writings from the feminist movement . Among the most valuable acquisitions are early editions of Mary Wollstonecraft ' s ' ' A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ' ' ( 1792 ) and the even rarer ' ' A Vindication of the Rights of Men ' ' ( 1790 ) . // ' ' There is something tremendously exciting about this old edition , ' ' says Ms. Walzer as she turns the rough-cut pages of ' ' A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . ' ' ' ' It has a physical presence that you don ' t find in any other form . Sure , you can get a paperback version , but there is nothing quite like seeing the very same book that so scandalized people when it first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of Susan B. Anthony ' s weekly newspaper ' ' The Revolution , ' ' which she published between 1868 and 1870 . This collection , which bears Susan B. Anthony ' s inscription in the flyleaf , was a gift to Harriet Robinson , a Lowell millworker who wrote a successful play about life in the mills. // Also among the titles pertaining to the women ' s movement is an 1877 pamphlet called ' ' Abbey Smith and Her Cows with a Report of the Law Case . Decided Contrary to Law . ' ' Written by Julia E. Smith , it is an account of a well-known case in which the author and her sister refused to pay their taxes because they were not allowed to vote . As a result , the tax collector sold their cows and land at auction. // Not all of the books and pamphlets in the collection are pro-feminist . One pamphlet called ' ' Ten Little Suffergets ' ' is an attack on women ' s suffrage , an illustrated verse patterned after the ' ' Ten Little Indians ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled ' ' The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage ' ' ( 1913 ) declares that women are ' ' intellectually inferior , hypersensitive and unreasonable. ' ' // Although books and pamphlets make up the majority of her collection , Ms. Walzer also has 88 color posters from the early 1920s that depict women wearing trousers , engaging in sports , and in other poses indicative of their new-found freedom . Most originally appeared as inserts in the New York World newspaper . ' ' Votes for Women ' ' banners and a front page from the New York Times with a photograph of the suffragette parade down Fifth Avenue are part of her collection as well. // Ms. Walzer , who has acquired her collection through a variety of channels , including auctions , used bookstores , and other collectors , believes that most feminist-related objects are going to be worth much more than they are now. // llectible item , and by that standard feminist books and other objects aren ' t yet considered very important , ' ' she says . ' ' But because the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and rarity , it ' s a good time to collect . There ' s still a lot of it out there. ' ' // Ms. Walzer estimates the books in her collection to be worth anywhere from $7. 50 for Elizabeth Bisland ' s ' ' A Flying Trip Around the World ' ' ( 1891 ) on up to $1 , 500 for Margaret Field ' s ' ' Letters and Photographs from the Battle Country , ' ' a manuscript and collection of original photographs taken during World War I. Both her copy of ' ' A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ' ' and the collection of Susan B. Anthony ' s newspapers are valued at $400. // ' ' One rule to follow when collecting books of any sort is that their condition is every bit as important as their age or rarity , ' ' says Ms. Walzer , who first acquired her knowledge from her parents , who owned an antiquarian bookstore . After running a book business of her own in Cambridge , she has recently moved to Newport , R.I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company. // She considers the knowledge gained while collecting to be as important as anything she learned in school or business . ' ' It ' s given me a sense of women ' s history that I ' ve never had before , ' ' she says . ' ' And it ' s something I ' ve been able to use in my own life . I think knowing what others have done gives you a sense of what you can do yourself. ' ' // //
