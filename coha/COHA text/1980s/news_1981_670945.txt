For Mr. Lain , who was named " Young Farmer of the Year " in Indiana last year , and for most other Middle Western farmers , the lingering drought that has plagued much of the area for a year and a half is over. // In most of the midlands this is unqualified good news , but in many of the highly productive farming counties of Illinois , Indiana and Ohio relentless rains in the last two months pose a new threat. // Much corn planting has been delayed past the time that would allow the crop to be harvested before the fall frosts . In many areas where corn planting has been delayed , the fields have been too wet for farmers to use heavy equipment to plant soybeans as a substitute . And in other regions rains have washed out or severely damaged many of the acres of corn and soybeans already planted. // All these problems have struck Lake County in northwestern Indiana . Last summer it was one of 16 Indiana counties that the Federal Government designated as drought disaster areas , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency loans. // The irony is not lost on Mr. Lain as he surveys the 900 acres of corn , 450 acres of soybeans and 60 acres of wheat that he had planted with his partner , Gerald Little . They estimate that much of the wheat and about half the corn and soybeans have been lost because of rains and flooding from overflowing drainage ditches that run through their property to the swollen Kankakee River . <> <> Irrigation System Not Needed // " I really wanted to buy an irrigation system , " Mr. Lain said with a wry smile . " But that ' s about $120 , 000 and I couldn ' t justify going out and borrowing that much more money. " // With a nod toward the water standing in one of his ruined fields , he added , " The way things turned out , I ' m just as glad I didn ' t buy one. " // Still , with the farmer ' s eternal conviction that whatever can go wrong will go wrong , he concluded , " But we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather ' s been so bad. " // In Washington , the Department of Agriculture is to disclose on Monday its latest estimate on the amount of acreage planted nationally in various crops and on Tuesday its projections for supply , demand and carryover at the end of the various crop seasons . These figures are closely guarded until they are announced , but Government officials have privately conceded that they are watching the weather over the Corn Belt with some apprehension this year . <> <> Problems in Corn Predicted // Conrad Leslie , a generally respected private crop forecaster in Chicago , said in an interview , " Abnormal rains and temperatures to the moment suggest United States corn supplies a year from now may be at an unusually low level. " // He said there was " still about five million acres of corn to plant " on June 15 , when the planting is usually complete . " This suggests the possibility then that we ' ll have below-normal yields on that late-planted acreage , " Mr. Leslie said . " In addition some of the early-planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded out. " // Mr. Leslie said that that the total corn acreage might slip as much as two million below the 74 million acres the Agriculture Department estimated in March would be harvested in the fall . At an average of 100 bushels an acre , he said , the total harvest would be 7. 2 billion bushels . <> <> Weather Called a Factor // " Consumption this season , with limitations on Soviet purchases , will be about 7. 5 billion bushels , " he said . " Thus it appears likely that we will have to use some of the 800-million-bushel Sept. 30 carryover in the new season . The extent will depend on United States weather during the next 90 days and the Soviet Union ' s weather and its appetite. " // Mr. Leslie said that " soybean weather will also be closely followed by market participants , " including farmers , purchasers and commodity specialists , since planting intentions published in March suggested that production would be about two billion bushels , just about meeting expected demand. // In western Iowa and Nebraska , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural officials are not yet expressing alarm about the overall crop outlook in either state. // Despite recent floods in the Great Bend area in western Kansas , which did considerable local damage to wheat , the state reports that crops are progressing well . And in Missouri , higher-than-normal rainfall in most parts of the state has relieved last year ' s drought problems . <> <> ' Rather Have Too Much Rain ' // " I guess you ' d say we ' d probably rather have too much rain than not enough , " said Bob Bellinghausen of the Missouri Crop and Livestock Reporting Service in Columbia. // But in Ohio , three western farming counties , Putnam , Wyandot and Hancock , have been declared Federal disaster areas and many other counties are being surveyed to determine the extent of their problems. // Francis B. McCormick of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said : " I ' ve been around the state all my life , and I was born in 1916 , and I ' ve never seen a spring like this . It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more. " // In Indiana , Gov . Robert D. Orr has declared the entire state an agricultural disaster area . Gary O. Swaim , director of the state ' s division of agriculture , said : " With three substantial rains in the last week , we ' re probably going to be looking at a billion-dollar loss for crop damage in corn , soybeans , wheat , hay and some tobacco in the southern part of the state . " <> <> Farmers Seek Federal Aid // For the last few days in Crown Point , Ind. , the seat of Lake County , farmers have been crowding into the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service ' s basement rooms in the post office . They have been filling out forms to declare how many acres of corn and soybeans they planted so they will be eligible for Federal assistance if it is granted and if their losses meet the Government ' s requirements for aid. // One of the farmers was Sheldon Miller , who owns 39 dairy cows and had planted 250 acres of corn and 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floods struck his farm in Lowell , Ind. // " We ' ve lost probably between 40 and 60 percent of our crop , " he said . " We ' re pretty well hurt . It ' s all drowned out . " Like most other farmers in the county , Mr. Miller said he had already used a weed-killing herbicide on his corn crop that would also destroy soybeans if he attempted to plant them in the damaged corn acreage. // " You ' re looking toward next year , you ' re not looking toward this year , " he said sadly . " The flooding for the farmer is the same thing as working six months without pay . So we need help . I don ' t know what we ' re going to do . Join the ranks of the unemployed ? Some of us are going to be forced to sell out and quit. " //
