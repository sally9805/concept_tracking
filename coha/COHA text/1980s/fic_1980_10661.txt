pleasant feeling came back . They argued angrily , but the anger was between them and not toward her . Dr. Duk once again in the familiar territory of ill will , relaxed , hiked up a thigh , took out a Marlboro . Her mother 's plan ( her mother : sitting bolt upright now , leaning forward , hand open to Dr. Duk , eyes fine ) : I want Allison to come home with us , Alistair . Not to your old room , honey . I know you do n't want that , but listen to this . Jason Cupp is restoring downtown Williamsport . We have a chance to buy the old Hunnicutt place for a song . Jason and Leslie will live there and restore it . And guess what 's out back ? Remember ? The old carriage house . It 's so lovely , the old bricks weathered and worn into scoops outside and down to cobblestonesinside . You can move in in three weeks . Wait , dear ! You have n't heard the best part . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guess what , a communityart center ! Painting , music , plays , you name it . And guess who we want for our music director ? It was n't my idea . The board wants her . The Board or Aurora bora ? she said . Boring or beautiful ? said Dr. Duk , looking at her with a smile ( they were after all two of a kind , she and Docky , compared with these exotic outsiders ) . I think beautiful . She skipped three grades , said her mother . She was the youngest girl ever to enter Mary Baldwin . She won the music prize her sophomore year and gave a concert her junior year , the only time it 's ever been done . Yeah , I was smart . I opened my mouth and nothing came out . I forgot the words . Forgot the Schubert , blew the Wolfe . I stood still and looked at them . Time passed . People looked away . They were embarrassed . Not only embarrassed but frightened and hateful . Who are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to come here in the first place ? What to do ? Leave . Check out . Went off the stage , straight out the fire-escape door , into the street , and right on out of town . Clink clunk . As I see it , said her mother , all the ingredients are there : she 'll be at home among family and friends , she 'll have her own lovely little place . But what 's most important she 'll be working at something she 's good at and something wep101need  --  she 's wonderful with children . And just to be on the safe side , we could all fly up here every weekend to check in with you . What do you think , dear ? Nnnnaaaahrgh . Yes . Well , I agree , honey , it must come as quite a shock . But think about it . What do you think , dear ? If I think about it , all I can think of is those scooped-out bricks and those cool dead colonial blues and grays and me lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said aloud was : Things though loose can be jammed nevertheless . Blue is for you but the instigation of color is climbing on the Sirius me . What ? said her father . What did she say ? he asked her mother . I know , dear , said her mother , aglint and fond . Her father 's plan ( her father , hitching forward and putting one forefinger on the other forefinger ) : No , Doc , no way . Allie is not ready to leave your care . ( Why were they all of a sudden making these plans ? ) But I do n't see why she should be cooped up here . What do you say to this : a house , her own house , here in the neighborhood , under your wing , so to speak , close enough so she can take part in groups and crafts and so forth . The nicest place money can buy . What 's money if you ca n't make your kid happy ? As a matter of fact , we saw one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up and play golf , said her mother . But if we restored the Hunnicutt houseSo you could be national secretary of the Dames , said her father , smiling back to his eyeteeth , feet springing under the chair . Now Walter , said her mother . She could see that Dr. Duk was just beginning to see that her father smiled all the time and that all his expressions , even frowns , occurred within the smile . For example , now he was grinning angrily , not smiling . She used to work for her father , as assistant to the dental hygienist , after she flunked life and had come home but before she curled up in a closet . He had passionate and insane viewsp102on every subject . She was certain that one reason he had taken up dentistry was so he could assault helpless people with his mad monologues . In he 'd come , smiling and handsome , hands scrubbed pink , breath sweet with Clorets , and while she kept the patient 's mouth dry with a suction tube , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fillings and fingers and then he 'd come out with it : " What 's wrong with Mao ? " or " What 's wrong with Franco ? " or " Do you know what I 'd do with them "  --  striking coal miners , hippies , queers , niggers , Arab sheiks , Walter Cronkite , George Wallace ( yes ! a hick , a peckerwood ) , media Jews , Miami Jews ( but not Israelis ! ) , Ronald Reagan ( yes ! a two-bit actor ) , Roosevelt ( ! ) , Carter , Martin Luther Coon , Kennedy , Nixon ( yes ! a crook ) , the Mafia , Goldwater ( yes ! he runs Arizona with Mafia help ) , J. Edgar Hoover ( yes ! a homosexual fascist punk ) . He liked General Patton . He had seen Patton eight times . " You know what I 'd do with all of them ? Line them up against that wall and go down the line with my BAR "  --  he grinning and boyish all the while , she embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was embarrassed for everybody ? and for a fact everybody did so badly ! ) , the patient 's eyes rolling . " You want to know my philosophy ? Shape up or ship out . If the cat keeps crapping on the rug , the cat goes  --  that 's all ! If the cook sasses me , the cook goes . What 's wrong with that ? " What do you think , Allie ? her father asked her . You take the top of the chalet . There 's a room in the back with a balconyand the damnedest view you ever saw . Well ? Wif you ? Wiv view ? she heard herself say . Why did she sound so crazy around her parents ? Because no matter what she said or did , her mother would make her own sense of it and her father would n't like it . So it did n't matter what she said . It was like being alone in a great echoing cave . There was a temptation to holler . A view ! said her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Duk , safe behind his thigh and therefore more able to conceal himself . You thought she said with view , meaning room with view . But thought I heard with you , meaning praps she might have some reservations about living with you . With you both . With yall.  |p103Dr  . Duk smiled , pleased with himself . He could talk Southern . They all looked at her . She shrugged . She did n't know which she meant or whether she meant anything . Dr. Duk 's plan : I think gall are overlooking one little thing . Both plans are excellent . But the fact remains that Allison is not quite herself yet  --  though she is clearly making progress , progress toward a decision to have something to do with us . My own feeling about Allison is that she knows a great deal more than she lets on . Right , Allison ? Wraing . You see , said Dr. Duk . What she said was halfway between right and wrong . She 's afraid to commit herself . My own wish is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think she needs any more shock treatments , said her mother . There 's nothing wrong with Allison except that she 's an extremely sensitive person who is more subject to tension than most people . So am I ! Tension ! That 's the enemy . She gets wound up just like me . You know what I do ? Stretch out and tell my toes to relax , then my knees  --  they do it ! You want to know what I think it all comes down to , said her father to the world around , looking at no one in particular . It all comes down to accepting your responsibility . Once you do that , you got it made . Shape up or ship out , she thought . Right . I 'm shipping out . This little refresher course is my own contribution , said Dr. Duk . I 'm reading a little paper on it in San Francisco . My finding is that a refresher course of six treatments in selected cases is even more effective than the usual thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like a radio with a bad volume control . They all looked at her . She herself will tell you , said Dr. Duk , that after receiving my own modified ECT , she feels better , relates better to people and her environment , speaks freely , eats better , sleeps better . Fried is crucified , said the radio . They all looked at Dr. Duk , she too.  |p104Dr  . Duk smiled down at his little Dead-Sea-scroll Marlboro . Allison is giving us her own theory of why ECT works  --  which is as good as any , to tell you the truth . Namely that going through the ordeal of ECT is a kind of expiation for guilt . Having expiated , one naturally feels better . Guilt ? said her mother , arching her back so suddenly that gold shivered and glinted . Guilt for what ? That is something we might well get into , said Dr. Duk . Now . How does this grab you ? I wonder if you two would be interested in coming up , participating in some family sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite promising . Come to think of it , I might just mention that our Founder 's Cottage here is available and you might consider that in lieu of the chaletLook , Doc , said her father . He was on his feet and for the first time unsmiling . It made him look queer . White showed in the smoothed-out crow's-feet . Taking off his new pink crinkly jacket , he draped it carefully over the back of the wooden chair . Now he faced them unsmiling but nodding , hands restinglightly on his hips ( seeing himself , she knew , as General Patton surveying the mess at Kasserine Pass ) . Let 's get this show on the road , Doc . Show ? said Dr. Duk , turning to her for translation . She translated : you and them but not me . That 's right , Doc . We got some business to talk over that Allison is not interested in . Could we talk in your office ? Oh , said Dr. Duk . He rose in some confusion . Okeydoke . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a little problem , said her father . I call a conference , around the dining-room table , after Dinah the cook leaves . I believe in getting it all out on the table . Then we take a vote . Then the chairman decides , said her mother . Chairman ? Again Dr. Duk asked her . Of the boring board . In the confusion of ushering them into his office , Dr. Duk got crossed up between wanting to please her father , wanting to get the show on the road , wanting to rent ( or sell ? ) the vacant Founder 's Cottage , and forgot about her . Dr. Duk smelled the money , Kelso said . Your folks must have struckp105oil , babe . He forgot to call McGahey to come get her , forgot even to send her back to her room . They all forgot her . Alone in the parlor , she felt good . She had been given leave , sanction , through omission . She felt like a child left at the movies and forgotten . She could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed than she knew what she would do . Her father wanted to get down to business with Dr. Duk  --  bidness he called it  --  and the business had to do with her . Therefore it was her business . It , the moment of the closing of the office door , was the beginning of her freedom . As she sat alone , it crossed her mind for the first time in her life : What if I make the plans for me ? What then ? Is there an I in me that can start something ? An initiating I , an I-I . What if I had left the black maid hanging out clothes , broke off the conversation and left , would it have killed her ? Would my embarrassment kill me ? Perhaps not . Why of all places , in this sour little parlor , should it have come to her , not only that she could make a plan but the plan itself ? She knew what to do and how to do it . All her life she had watched people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his desk in the casemented bay . A Nikon camera fixed to a tripod stood next to him . One window , the one with the feeding station , was always cranked open in good weather . If an evening grosbeak or a goldfinch showed up , Dr. Duk could snap the camera by moving his hand only an inch or so to a remote-control device . Sometimes he kept the shutter switch in his hand . If she was talking to him and he heard a bird alight behind him , his eyes did not move from her face yet he seemed to be looking through the back of his head . A thick tree-sized pittosporum smelling of bitter bark covered window and feeding station . Under the station was a space , a little leafy room where one could sit in comfort on a limb of pittosporum . Tuesday the man came again . Again it was she who saw him before he saw her . She was in the shadow of the rock filling ap106Clorox jug from the tiny waterfall . The dog rumbled and his spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking toward the greenhouse from the glade . His hands were in his pockets . Something in brown paper was tucked under his arm . The sunlight made a glint on a facet of his forehead and his brown hair , which had streaks in it . Was it turning gray or was it burnished and bleached by the sun ? Was he gray-haired or a platinum blond ? He was not goodlooking . His eye sockets were too deep , his eyes too light , his mouth too grim , his skin burned too dark by the sun . Her father always smiled ; he never smiled . A shadow like a Germansaber scar crossed one cheek . Today he was dressed differently . Instead of golf clothes , he wore an ordinary white shirt and ordinary pants . No , not ordinary . The shirt was tailored and had a soft rolled buttoned-down collar and the pants were narrow in the cuff and at least two inches above the dirty tennis shoes . Was he dressed carelessly as her father would dress if he put on shirt and pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would dress . The way he walked reminded her of the yachtsmen who stopped in Williamsportand strolled about town : not exactly ambling and not striking out , foot coming down heel first , but toed in , left shoulder coming forward with left leg . It was either a Northernwalk or a yachting walk . Yes , that 's what he was , she thought watching him through the waterfall , a Northern millionaire with his platinumstreakedhair growing carelessly-carefully under and over the soft collar , who would spend a hundred dollars for corduroy pants so they would look uncreased and too small but too small in the right way not the wrong way like her father 's khakis , which made his stomach look too big , or Dr. Duk 's double knits , which were too tight in the crotch . Just as before , his head was turned slightly  --  was he listening for her in the greenhouse ?  --  so that he faced her but did not see her though she was less than twenty feet away . Under the jut of his brow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched they seemed to open and close , now shut and dark , now open and pale , like a trick picture of Jesus . Yes , it was a trick of light or of her own retina . She shut her eyes . Thep107image of him went dark then bright with eye sockets like a skull . There at her door he stood in the same odd and absolute stillness , the same way she had seen him standing in the glade . Ha , what to do at a greenhouse door clearly full of nothing but plants ? ring a doorbell ? knock on glass ? Yes , because he was lifting a hand to the door . Perhaps she had opened her mouth to say something or perhapsshe had moved , but before she could do anything else and just as the man 's hand touched the house , the dog charged . The man had time to turn , it seemed to her slowly , the sunlightstriking a different plane of his forehead , and held out his hand palm down to the dog . Too slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his studied Northern nonchalance ? No , becauseeven now his eyes could not or would not focus on the dog . He did n't care whether the dog bit him or not ! It was not courage , not even inattention but rather , she saw , a kind of indifference yet a curiosity with it . Would the dog attack ? Would tooth enter flesh ? If it did , would it matter ? The hand was held out like a piece of meat proffered by the man . It was easy to imagine him examining the wound as if it belonged to someone else . She hollering something , the bristle-backed dog charging flat out , past all snarling , and even as he took the hand in his mouth in the same instant fetched up stiff-legged , shoulders jutting up one then the other like a reined-in horse , sliding to a sit , pushed the hand out of his mouth with his tongue and cocked a yellow tufted eyebrow around but not quite to her . Embarrassedagain . They watched as the dog settled his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did he stop because of my saying or because of your not saying ? " asked the girl . " I 'm not sure . Probably because of your saying . Would you give me a drink of water . I 've had a long walk . " It was sweat , she saw , that made his hair and forehead shine . He followed her into the greenhouse . Without raising his head , he looked around , his lightish eyes moving in deepsockets . " It still smells like a greenhouse . Once I was in Cincin/nati . I liked the smell of a greenhouse there so much I worked in it for six months . " " Doing which and how and was it for a consideration ? How much ? " she asked , eyes widening with interest . " Would you  --  " She stopped . Would he what ? " Work for you ? " he said . " How much do you pay ? " " Never mind . " She gave him the Clorox bottle . He drank a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your water ? " " Yes . How thirsty . It 's been a long time . " " Since what ? Since seeing anybody thirsty ? " " Something  --  something is up front but not all the way . " " You mean you 're having difficulty remembering things and that you almost remembered something ? " " Yes , that 's  --  " " I had that once . In my case it was a question of not wanting to remember . In fact , I remembered something here in this spot that I had n't thought of for years . " " Was it for a gladness or the same old Sunday coming down ? " " No , it was n't the same old Sunday coming down . I ca n't say it was a happy memory but I was glad I remembered . I feel much better . You will too . Thank you for the water . " " You are  --  Are you ? " " I brought you something . " " What ? " She noticed the brown bag . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I was in the hospital for  --  it is the time I ca n't remember . " " I know . " " I was somewhat suspended above me but I am getting down to me . " " Good . " She was about to say something but she saw in his eyes that he had drifted away . They stood in silence . It was not for her like a silence with another person , a silence in which something horrid takes root and grows . What if nobody says anything , what then ? Sometimesshe thought she had gone crazy rather than have to talk to people . Which was worse , their talk or their silences ? Per/haps there was no unease with him because he managed to be both there and not there as one required . Is it possible to stand next to a stranger at a bus stop and know that he is a friend ? Was he someone she had known well and forgotten ? " Are you  --  ? " " Am I what ? " " Are you my  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment she wondered if she had considered saying something crazy like " Are you my lover ? " Or " Are you my father ? " She sighed . " You said the bag . " " What ? Oh yes . I brought this for you . " He gave her the bag . She opened it . " Avocados ? I think . And  --  what ? A little square can of  --  " She read : "  --  Plagniol . " He watched her . " What a consideration ! But more than a consideration . The communication is climbing to the exchange level and above . And the Plagna is not bologna . " Gazing at her , he almost smiled . In her odd words he seemed to hear echoes of other voices in other years . One hundred years ago Judge Kemp might have said on this very spot : " How considerate of you ! " with the same exclamatory lilt . But there was another voice , something new and not quite formed . Did she mean that his consideration ( being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount ) , more than exchange ( market value of the Plagniol ) , which was after all baloney ? " I think you will like that olive oil . It is very good . Some friends brought the avocados from California . They 're the best kind , not hard and green , but a little soft and brown . They 're very good for you . You 're too thin . Fill a half with olive oil . " The avocados were as big as coconuts . " I 'll plant the pits in the greenhouse , " she said . " No tricks with toothpicks . " " Right . Plant them in soil . " Later she tried to decide why she felt so free to talk or not talk with him . Was it because of her , that in her new life shep110could have gotten along with anybody ? Was she just lonely ? Or was it a certain tentativeness in him that waited on her , like the dog , even now and then cocking an eye in her direction ? Or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Southern social graces because she was ha ha her mother 's daughter after all ? Her fingers felt the rough pebbled texture of the avocados . " Why are they here ? " " Why did I bring them ? I thought you might like them . For another thing  --  " " Yes ? " " They are the most nourishing of all vegetables . " " What is entailed with you ? " " Nothing . Why ? " " You seem somewhat pale and in travail . Is the abomination at home or in the hemispheres ? " " I do n't know . Maybe both . You mean my brain . I do n't feel very well , to tell the truth . " Later he irritated her and she got rid of him . He was standing by while she told him what she meant to do with the stove . There it was hanging from a rope suspended between two chimneys . It looked like a small iron house ripped from its foundations , pipes and connections dangling . She explained . " I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ropes on the chimneys which have shoulders like steps . " Listen to me talking good , she thought . Perhaps in order to talk all you need to do is do something , then explain what you have done . " Tomorrow the stove will go from here to there . " He stood , hands in pockets , looking up at the stove from under his eyebrows as if it had descended from another world . " How ? " he asked . She did not reply . " What --  ? " he began and stopped . He is in some kind of distress , she thought . After a moment he said : " You got that thing up there all by yourself ? " " Yes . " " How are you going to get it over there ? " " It 's downhill . "  | " I know , but  --  " He stopped . " Yes ? " " Ah , why do you want it over there ? " He sounded as if he had a hundred questions and picked this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to put it in the greenhouse ? " " Yes . What type of stove do you call it ? " " It is a cook stove . " " Does it burn wood ? " " Yes . " " Will it both keep me warm and cook ? " " Yes . It also has a water tank . " " Then it will have hot water ? " " If it gets cold water and then you feed it wood . " She clapped her hands without smiling . " The climb is un-derway . " " Yes , right . The climb may be underway , but "  --  he turned toward her , shoulder turning with his head , but did not quite meet her eye  --  " you see , it has pipes which you connect with a plumbing system . And I do n't believe  --  " " I can bring water down from the rock . " " Well , yes , you could if  --  " " Do you have my dossier ? " " Your what ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You look like you know about me . " " I know something about you . " Her eyes fell . Forehead muscles pushed her eyebrows down into a shelf . Then he had come from her parents . " Then the word came from the bloard . " " Bloard ? " He did n't know what she meant . From the board ? the broad ? blood ? blood kin ? bloody broad ? All these ? What she meant was board and bored , meeting of her father 's board which was boring because it bored into you . " Look . I 'll be back in half an hour . " " No no . Naw . " " I did n't mean to upset you . I 'm going to get a golf cart from the club and a trailer and a couple of men and we 'll put the stove where you want it . " " Oh no. "  | " No ? Why not ? " " Because there I will be with people having put the stove where I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being in a fix . Then what ? The helping is not helping me . " " I see . " After a while he said : " You mean you would rather do it yourself . " " The arrangement is the derangement . When the arrangementis arranged , then you know what the ensuement is . " " No , what is the ensuement ? " " The ensuement is : then I am with the arrangement . " " Yes , I see that . But does that also mean that you ca n't accept anything from anybody ? " She tightened her arms around the brown bag . " The contentsare intense and also tense . " " Why is that ? " " Because of the thanks . After thanks come blanks . " " Not necessarily . The avocados are yours . You do n't owe me any thanks . But if you did thank me , it would n't take anything away from the avocados . They would n't become blank . They 're solid . " " That is not the climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When are you going to leave ? " " Oh . " " You see . " " What ? " " The feelings are more than revealing . " " Yes , I see what you mean . Yes , you may have hurt my feelings a little , but maybe not as badly as you think . At any rate , it is not an awful thing . I 'll leave so you can enjoy the avocados . " " It 's not you . " " You mean it 's not that you dislike me but you do n't know how to get rid of me and that makes you nervous . What if I do n't leave ? Yes , it 's a problem sometimes . I developed an art of moving people out of my office . It was a matter of placementof chairs and of getting up and moving in such a way that the other person moves in front of you and finds himself at the door without knowing how he got there . "  | " Le cool is coming soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool ? Yes , fall is upon us . " " Le dad is no better than le doc and what are you in le plan ? " " Well , I do n't know . But I was n't trying to be your father or your doctor . " " Understanding can also be a demand . De man . Le mans . " " Yes . I guess you are fed up with people trying to understand you . And I guess I was sounding like  --  who ? De man . What man is that , I wonder . I 'm making you nervous . I 'll be going . " " Yes , I have to go also . " She hugged the bag . " They 're mine when you leave . " " They 're yours now . " " But I can not inspect them with your inspection . " " I understand . Very well , I 'll leave so you can inspect them . " " Okay then . " She waited . Why did n't he leave ? It is difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say and what to do with your eyes . Maybe it is easier to be crazy than to put up with people 's pauses . Suppose he did n't leave . He left . Whew . She began to think of topics of conversation in case he should come again . Later the dog walked toward the chestnut fall , sat , and cocked his head . The man was getting up from a log where he had been sitting ( watching her ? ) . He began to walk and fell down . She hurried to help him but he was up quickly , brushing himself off . " What happened ? " She took his arm and was thinking not so much about him but about herself , the sudden weakness at the pit of her stomach when he fell , her heart still racing . What happened to me ? she meant . " I fell down . " " I know that . But why ? " " I do n't know . Lately I tend to fall down . " " That 's all right I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 'd make a twosome . "  | " Do n't joke . " " All right . " Was that the world 's secret then , that you have to joke all the time ? Is that how you live ? The man was sitting on a polished chestnut log , one arm stretched over his knee , hand open . He seemed to be looking at the barbed-wire fence . Now he stood and putting his hands in his pockets bent over them as if he were cold . " What ? " she asked . " Nothing . I  --  " He looked at his watch . His brown smooth hand still had tooth marks from the dog . She could not take her eyes from his hand . " I love  --  " she began . " You love what ? " She loved his hand . " Is it time and if it is , time for what ? " she asked . " Time ? Yes . " He was gazing at the fence in an absent staringway . He broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhereat five-thirty .

" " Okay . Then go home . " " Right . " They were both startled by her command . He left . She watched as he stepped through the fence , paused , then went quickly through . Now , standing and facing her from the golf links , he seemed to feel freer , as if the fence allowed a neighborliness . " Perhaps you would not mind a suggestion , " he said . " No , I would n't .

" " You have some planks , but you 're going to need a creeper to get the stove down the hill . " " Thanks for the word . " He noticed that she treated the gift of the word exactly like the avocados . She 'd have to think about it after he left . As she listened she noticed he was white around the eyes . Did he usually wear sunglasses ? His eyes , his face reminded her of something , what ? yes , of the face and white eyes of combat soldiers she had seen a long time ago in Life magazine . The eyes of the soldiers could not or would not bring themselves to focus . Why could she remember perfectly an old Life magazine but could not quite remember why she had decided to come here ? " Go to Washau Motors in town , " the man said . " They sell Fords . I own it . But you wo n't have to mention my name .

And there are two other things you 're going to need . " " What ? " " You are probably going to have to take the stove apart to move it and to get it through the door of the greenhouse . You 're going to need two ten-inch crescent wrenches and a can of WD-4o to loosen the rusty bolts . " " Give me the words . " She took out pad and pencil . He wrote : Creeper .

The bark had a bitter smell . In the dim light and damp bitter-bark smell of the pittosporum there was the sound just above her head of a bird on the feeding tray . It was scratching seed with its feet like a chicken . The only way she could get comfortable sitting on the not quite horizontal branch was to slump against the trunk . Through the open casement of Dr. Duk 's office came her father 's voice , faint then louder , going away then coming back . He was pacing up and down , shirt-sleeved , hands on hips , getting the show on the road . Dr. Duk would be sitting four feet from her , safer now behind his desk and swiveled around in his chair , keeping one eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case a painted bunting should show up .

She must be sitting in the patient 's chair across the desk , bolt upright , one little finger in her mouth , eyes lidded and ironic as she watched her husband.  --  might disagree on the particulars , Doc , said her father , coming close now . But one thing we can sure as hell agree on and that 's Allison 's well-being . It 's her happiness and health which comes first , now and always , right ? Right on , said Dr. Duk . ( No , dumb Docky Duck . Not right on . Like Kelso says , when you try to sound like something , you do n't sound like nothing . ) Get to the point , Tiger , said her mother dryly . A muted clunk , heavy gold striking gold , and she knew without seeing that her mother pursed one corner of her mouth and stuck her fist into her waist , jangling her bracelets . Not point , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have the obligation to act in Allison 's bestp117interests , right ? You , Dr. Duk , in her medical interests , we , Katherine and I , in all her other interests , home , family , finances , future , and so forth . Yes ? said Dr. Duk , perking up . He did after all have an ear for such things and knew when something was up . At this moment he was looking at her father and thinking , as Kelso would say : What 's this dude up to , dropping by on his way to a party with all these plans for Allison when he has n't showed up twice in the past year ? And what are these two all steamed up about with their competing plans , and what 's coming up now , the real plan ? What 's this about finances ? Have they suddenly gotten rich ? Point number two : As Allison 's parents we are also her guardians , right ? I mean especially since Allison is hardly competentto manage her own affairs . WellWould you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new law there is a difference between a person being mentally incompetentand legally incompetent ? That even a person committed to a mental institution can inherit property ? Would I believe , you ask . Yes , I think IWould you believe this , Doc ?  --  and this is the bottom line , folks  --  that even in such a case the parents do not automaticallyqualify as guardians ? Well yes , as a matter of factI mean , what the hell is happening to the American family ? Her father 's voice swept around the room like a searchlight . You know what I would do with people like Earl Warren ? You do n't have to . Earl Warren 's dead , said her mother wearily . Why do n't you get to the point , Tiger ? Would you believe , Doc , that in order for us to be Allison 's legal guardians , we have to petition the court and that it is up to the judge , any damn local redneck judge , to decide ? Well(What 's up , Doc ? Your ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where you come in , Alistair , said her mother crisply , clinking and gathering herself . I 'm quite sure you know the new laws better than we do . Namely , that a legal procedure isp118involved and that your testimony as to Allison 's legal competencewill be crucial . I mean , my stars ( now her eyes would be going up to the ceiling ) , you could testify in good conscience to my legal competence . Of course . Quite . Dr. Duk 's voice was going down . No doubt he was rolling his unlit Marlboro cigarette . The little Dead Sea scroll was still undecipherable , but there was somethinghere ! The only thing I do n't quite see , ca n't find the handle of , said Dr. Duk carefully , is why all of a sudden the issue becomesimportant at this point in time . ( This point in time . Oh , Docky , now we 're Nixon . The question is , who are you , Docky , and what are you doing here at this point in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hard against the trunk . She closed her eyes and ears to the words . The voices rose and fell , mounted against each other , glanced off , went away , came back , joined . It was like being a child and listening from the top of the stairs . Voices can be understoodwithout words . Her father 's voice now had the same ragging importunate tone she heard from the landing when he was winning at poker . Dr. Duk 's was tentative , premonitory  --  like a prospector whose Geiger counter begins to click : hold on , what 's this ? what have we here ? Her mother 's voice was foot-wagging , eyes going around , exclamatory , impatient : oh , for heaven 's sake , let 's get this over with ! She started listening again when after a silence her father 's voice changed , fell into a quiet storytelling cadence . Such-andsuchhappened . So-and-so did it . Everyone listens when someonetells the news of a happening . Something had happened , and he was telling it as much to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the saying out loud , could he believe it . She pricked up her ears . They were talking about her.  --  and would you believe , Doc , that the old lady , Aunt Sally , was not even her aunt ? She was her real aunt 's friend , Aunt Grace . The two of them had lived together for thirty years , fought like cats and dogs most of the time . They used to come over every Sunday for dinner , so Allie naturally called Miss Sally Aunt Sally . Sure , we knew Miss Sally was fond of Alliep119ever since Allie was a little girl  --  for one thing Allie was the only one who would listen to her because the old lady could talk the ears off a jackass and frankly I could n't stand it more than a few minutes ( That was because I thought I was supposed to and did not know how not to listen or what would happen to a person if one got up and went away. )  --  and it was a good two weeks after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had had for twenty years , brought it over to me , this old metal Crailo candy box with a piece of ruled paper inside and about three lines in Miss Sally 's handwriting  --  the paper wrinkled from having been balled up once just before being thrown away , because Ludean was cleaning up Miss Sally 's room and you know how niggers like those old candy boxes to keep things in ( Now how in the world would Docky know anything about niggers and Crailo candy boxes ? )  --  I still do n't know how Ludean had sense enough to save it but there it was , carefully uncrumpled and smoothed out , saying : Being of sound mind I hereby leave all my worldly goods to my dear little friend , Allison Hunnicutt Huger . What had happened of course was that she and Grace had had a fight and she had changed her will , so Grace should have gotten it but we 'll take care of Grace  --  so there it is , a perfectly good holographicwill dated last month and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her lawyer who is sitting there with probably six previous wills in his safe  --  you know what I would do with lawyers , do n't you ? Yes , we know , Tiger , said her mother . We have to leave in ten minutes . So I 'm thinking mainly it 's funny and certainly no big deal since her worldly goods consist of only two items she was always joking about : her grandfather 's poor little old dirt farm on the side of a mountain which she used to say was so steep the mule had to grow longer legs on one side to plow it , and the other , a sandspit of an island off Georgia which had two pine trees and whose only value was the treasure Captain Kidd was supposed to have buried and nobody had ever found . ( Yes , and that 's one reason I 'd listen to her  --  I 'd see myselfp120on the island with a map , climbing up one tree and sighting through the other . It was n't even the treasure I liked but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and findingit through a geometry of pine trees . ) So all this time she had been paying her taxes and talking about her dirt farm and her island and nobody had been listeningbut Allie . How about that ? Get to the point , Walter . I 'm leaving , said her mother . Okay . The point is , to make a long story short , that her poor little old dirt farm is eight hundred acres next to the Linwood golf course and her sandspit of an island is over two thousand acres , more of a wilderness than Cumberland which you 've heard of , and that the Arabs have already offered two mill one for it . That 's getting to the point , is n't it . Two mill one ? said Dr. Duk . Two million one hundred thousand dollars , Doctor . ( How about that , Doc ? ) Silence . Sounds only of fingers drumming on wood  --  Dr. Duk 's on his desk ?  --  and bird scratching feed  --  painted bunting ? Docky , you 've plumb forgot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , did n't you , Mrs. Huger ? said Dr. Duk in a new voice , a deeper richer crisper voice . Well , Allisonis the point , is n't she ? Clearly you have much to think about but equally clearly we can agree on one thing , ca n't we ? That no matter which of your plans seems more feasible when Allison is well enough to leave here  --  assuming she is well enough but as I do n't have to tell you , Dr. Huger , there is no such thing as a guarantee in either dentistry or psychiatry , is there ? But we can agree that no matter what comes to pass , we will bear any burden , pay any price , to do what is best for Allison . Right ? ( Jesus , Docky , first Nixon , now Kennedy ? ) You got it , Doc . That is certainly true of us . I gather you have the same concern for Allison . You better believe it . ( Not had , Doc . You almost got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we got our ducks in a row ?  |p121Ducks  ? said Dr. Duk suspiciously . He knew people called him Dr. Duck . One , you do what is right for Allie medically . Go ahead with your treatment . Two , meanwhile we 'll all three do what is right for Allison legally . Three , Katherine and I will come up with a long-term plan , maybe a place for Allie in Linwood , maybe a place at home , maybe we 'll take over your Founder 's Cottage for family sessions or whatever  --  is the place for sale , by the way ? Anyhow , we 'll seeAgainthe meaning of the words went away and there was only the feint and parry of the voices , and then the goodbye sound of words swerving together before going away . Chairs scraped . They were on their feet . There was not much time , not more than two or three minutes . That was enough , because she knew what she wanted to do . No , there was plenty of time , as it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached the parlor , the tone of their voices rising but not quite reaching the penultimate breakpoint of goodbye . She figured she had another thirty seconds . And she did , time enough to reach her father 's pinkcrinklyjacket still carefully draped over the back of her wooden chair , from it take out the blue-leather passport-size wallet she knew he used when he wore a jacket and from it four of the one-hundred-dollar bills she knew he took on a trip ( You know what I would do with American Express ? ) , and was out and down the hall and halfway up the stairs so quickly and yet so silently that she could hear their voices as the inner door of the office opened . In her bathroom she folded the bills lengthwise once and put them under the loose leather lining in one of her slippers . Then she lay on her bed and waited for her parents to come tell her goodbye . After they left she sat at her window , head wedged in the corner of her wingback chair , took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making his weekly visit to the nursing home his wife 's money had built , he realized that he was doing exactly the same things he did when she was alive , taking the same route through the gleaming halls , even visiting the same patients . The only difference was that instead of pushing Marion ahead of him in her wheelchair , he had Jack Curl the chaplain in tow . But something was different . Ordinarily Jack Curl would have distracted him . All his life he had waited on people , tuned in on them , attended them . Now for some reason it did n't matter . As Jack Curl talked , Will Barrett stood in the hall moving his head a little to make the bright sunlight race like quicksilveraround the beveled glass of the front door . He seemed to remember halls , the hall of the hospital where his father stayed in Georgia , the hall of the hospital where Jamie died in Santa Fe . How odd , he thought smiling to himself , that then I did n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I knew what to do was when something bad happened to somebody . Disaster gave me leave to act . Between times I did n't know what to do . Now I know . Now he remembered that after he had gone to find the Negro guide and sent him for the sheriff , he had returned to his father lying in the pin-oak swamp . He sat down beside him to wait . The man 's eyes opened . His father did not speak but in his eyes there were both sorrow and certitude . Now youknow , the eyes said . I 'm sorry . I was trying to tell you some/thing and I did n't . Now you 'll have to find out for yourself . I 'm sorry . Very well , he thought . I found out . Now I know what to do . " What ? " he said . Jack Curl had asked him something . " I said what I remember about Marion was the way she not only knew about all the patients but the help too . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued her wonderfulidea of inviting patients to your home . She 'd have liked that . This week it 's Mr. Arnold 's turn , is n't it ? Do you remember how she always asked about the janitor 's grandchildren  --  by name ? Now I 'm the janitor . She 'd have liked that too . Do you remember ? " " Yes . " No . What he remembered was the weight of her , the angle and set of his own body when he levered her out of the Rolls and in one motion around and into the wheelchair . A tuft of bronze hair curled through the zipper of the chaplain 's jump suit . Jack Curl 's muscular jaw swelled like a pear under the temples just as his lower body swelled like a pear in the jump suit . Yet he was as light on his feet as a good dancer . He danced around in front of him like a child to catch his attention . Today for some reason it was possible to observe the smallest detail about Jack Curl , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by shaving a little below them . The short new hair did not match the long hair of the sideburns . But more than that : he suddenly saw the purpose of the jump suit and Jack Curl 's shambling way of walking and his not quite clean hands and the pliers in his hip pocket and the way he moved his shoulders in the jump suit . Jack Curl was saying : I am more than a clergyman going about doing clerical things . I am also a handyman , a super , something of a tough really . Somebody has to fix the plumbing and wiring . To do God 's work , it is necessary to come off manual work . Like Paul fixing tents . He took a good look at Jack Curl . How did it happen that now for the first time in his life he could see everything so clearly ? Something had given him leave to live in the present . Not once in his entire life had he allowed himself to come to rest in the quiet center of himselfp124but had forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember to a future which did not exist . Not once had he been present for his life . So his life had passed like a dream . Is it possible for people to miss their lives in the same way one misses a plane ? And how is it that death , the nearness of death , can restore a missed life ? Marion knew this . She loved to go to funerals . They went to funerals in Manhattan , Long Island , Utica , and all over the South ; funerals of her uncles and aunts and cousins , his uncles and aunts and cousins , kinfolk he 'd never seen . Funerals made her solemn and vivacious . The old folk here died off like flies . She attended every funeral and volunteered him as pallbearer . Suddenly he had become pallbearerto friend , kin , and stranger . It became clear why Presidentslike to go to funerals . The worse things got for Lyndon Johnson , the more funerals he went to , there he stood grave and silent , dispensed . Like a President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn and exultant . Why is it that without death one misses his life ? When Marion was dying , he was standing at the window of the hospitalroom , hands in pockets , gazing down at the bluish-white street light above the empty corner . It was four o'clock in the morning . She spoke to him in a different voice . In the dark her jaundice  --  she was yellow as a gourd  --  did not show , but her voice was quavery with fever . " Yes ? " he said and came to the bed . She looked at him calmly . Had they looked at each other in years ? " I want you to do something , " she said . " All right , " he said . " Keep the house for Leslie . " " All right , " he said . " She is going to need a place , " she said . " She is going to California but she will want to come back here , wo n't she ? " " Yes , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the quietness of people after a storm which had drowned out their voices . What struck him was not sadnessor remorse or pity but the wonder of it . How can it be ? How can it happen that one day you are young , you marry , and then another day you come to yourself and your life has passed like a dream ? They looked at each other curiously and wondered how they could have missed each other , lived in the same house all those years and passed in the halls like ghosts.  | " Let me say this , Will , " said Jack Curl , dancing around and stopping him in a kind of mock confrontation . " O.K. " " Marion , your dear wife , my friend , the only benefactor these old people had , is gone . Right ? " " Right . " " Do you know the last thing she told me before she died ? " " No . " " She wanted to go ahead with the one project closest to her heart . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a retirement village . A total loveand-faithcommunity . " " Ah . " " What do you think of this for a name ? The Marion PeabodyBarrett Memorial Community . " " Sounds fine . " " Does it sound too much like a commune ? " " No , it sounds fine . " " All I ask of you is what you yourself want : to carry out her wishes . " All you ask from me is three million dollars . Well , why not ? How could he not have noticed this about Jack Curl before ? that even as he was moving his shoulders around under his jump suit , playing the sweaty clergyman doing good , that Jack too was trying to catch hold of his own life ? that in the very moment of this joking godly confrontation  --  sure , I 'm trying to con you out of three million , Will , but it 's a good cause and I 'm God 's own con man , okay ? and so forth  --  here was Jack Curl trying to catch hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he doing everything right ? Yet when you took a good look at him , this sweaty Episcopal handyman , this godly greasy super , you saw in an instant that he was not quite there . Looking at him was like trying to focus on a blurred photograph . But you , old mole , you knew otherwise , did n't you ? You knew the secret . I could see it in your eyes , open and clear and brown , when you were run to ground in a Georgia swamp and looking up at me . You shot yourself , and then we could talk.  |p126You  knew the secret . But how can that be ? How can it be that only with death and dying does the sharp quick sense of life return ? For that was your secret , was n't it ? That it was death you loved most of all and loved so surely that you wanted to share the secret with me because you loved me too . One night after the war and during the Eisenhower years the father was taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . " The trouble is , " the man said , " there is no word for this . " " For what ? " " This . " He held both arms out to the town , to the wide world . " It 's not war and it 's not peace . It 's not death and it 's not life . What is it ? What do you call it ? " " I do n't know . " " There is life and there is death . Life is better than death but there are worse things than death . " " What ? " " There is no word for it . Maybe it never happened before and so there is not yet a word for it . What is the word for a state which is not life and not death , a death in life ? " " I do n't know . " " I wonder if it ever happened in history before ? " " I do n't know . " Where is the word , the girl in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked at the chaplain and past him to the sunlight , which had turned yellow and now shone straight through the front door . I wonder what you would have thought of rich Christian Carolina , old mole . " What ? " " I said what a great lady Marion was to give so unendingly of herself . There was so much to give . " " Do you mean because she was so rich or because she was so fat ? " " Ha ha . That 's a winner . Touche . Marion would have loved that . Yes , Marion was far too heavy . God knows I tried to tell her . She said look who 's talking . " He put his hands on his side , a jolly fat lightfooted friar in a jump suit . " Marion and I had much in common . We loved all the good things God gives us.  |p127In  a word we like to eat . But no , that 's not what I meant by her heart 's desire . You know what I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun was setting . " I am talking about Marion 's dream of a community of people living out their lives married , together , not burdening anybody , a true love-and-faith community lived according to the rhythm of God 's own liturgical year . " God , love , faith , marriage . The old words clanged softly in the golden air around them like the Westminster chimes of St. John 's steeple clock . " Actually , Will , it was your other lady I wanted to talk to you about . " " What other lady is that ? " " Ha ha . I 'm talking about my favorite girlfriend , the apple of your eye , your lovely daughter Leslie , a real sweetheart . " Leslie a sweetheart ? lovely ? the apple of his eye ? Leslie , his daughter , was a tall sallow handsome dissatisfied nearsighted girl whose good looks were spoiled by a frown which had made a heavy inverted U in her brow as long as he could remember . " What about Leslie ? Is she giving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does she want now ? " " She wants to write her own wedding ceremony . " " Could it be any worse than your new liturgy ? " " Ha ha . That 's a winner . But what are we going to do ? " " We ? " " You do n't have a bishop looking down your throat . " " I sure do n't . " Jack pulled him close . They were standing outside the open door of a room . Jack almost whispered . " I want you to meet our newest couple . Tod and Tannie Levitt . Actually they 're our oldest couple . We 've stretched a point and allowed them to share the same room . They 're eighty-five and eighty-seven . In the same room ! Big deal , right ? Bear with me . I have my devious reasons . They 're cute as they can be . You 'll love them . But , more important , I thinkp128you 'll see the possibilities of a real couples ' community even in this bareass hospital room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rustic setting , a simple but homey apartment with a balcony opening onto the entire Smoky Mountains . Did you know that the hundred twenty-first psalm was Marion 's favorite ? I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help . And you better believe that 's where hers came from . " Tod and Tannie were sitting slumped in their wheelchairs between two beds . The television was mounted on a steel elbow high above them , too high to see . The Crosswits was on without sound . Tod was nodding and both hands in his lap were rolling invisible pills . Tannie was no bigger than a child . Her back was bowed into a semicircle so that she faced her knees . Her eyes were closed . But her bed jacket was a cheerful pink , all silk and ribbons and lace , and her soft white hair was as perfectly combed and curled as a Barbie doll 's . " Will , " said Jack Curl loudly . " I want you to meet Tod and Tannie , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tannie did not open her eyes . A sound like a soft whistle came from her . " They 're this week 's winners on the dating game , " said the chaplain , winking at him . " So they 're shacking up with us . Right , Tod ? " Tod nodded , had not stopped nodding . He gazed down at Tannie 's little stick arms . The skin was white and paper dry but a vein , thick and powerful as a snake , coiled on her wrist . " Now watch this , " said Jack in a lower voice but not mindingif Tod and Tannie overheard him . " This is what I mean by an ongoing couple relationship . Tod ! " Tod went on nodding and rolling pills . " Tannie ! " cried the chaplain . Tannie went on snoring , chin on her chest . " Tod and Tannie ! Give us a little song ! " Tod did not stop nodding but one hand seemed to rise of itself and give Tannie a poke in the ribs . " Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if he had pressed a button , Tannie 's head flew up , herp129eyes opened , showing milky-blue , and she began to sing in a high-pitched girlish voice . Tod 's hand conducted and his head lilted from side to side instead of nodding . He came in on every third word or so . Daisy , Daisy , give me your answer true . I 'm half crazy , all for the love of you . It wo n't be a stylish marriage , I ca n't afford a carriage , But you 'll look sweet upon the seat Of a bicycle built for two ! " For two , " said Tod . The instant the song was finished , Tannie 's head sank to her chest and she began to snore . Tod stopped conducting and went back to nodding and pill rolling . " Well ? " asked Jack Curl in the hall . " Beats television , " he said vacantly , moving his head to make the yellow light race around the beveled glass of the front door . " You better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Now . What I want you to imagine is the two of them , Tod and Tannie , and two hundred couples like them , from sixtyfiveon up , each with their own little rustic villa , coming back after evensong and lifting up their eyes to the hills . What do you think ? " " Okay , " he said , unable to move his eyes from the sunlit door . " Okay ? " Jack Curl rounded , came closer , in excitement . " You mean  --  " " I mean I will do as you say . I will imagine them . " " Oh . Good . I think . " When an old person died at St. Mark 's , often there was no one to claim the body . Marion would go to great lengths to trace the family and arrange the funeral . Yamaiuchi would chauffeur them in the Rolls , leading the way for the hearse to distant Carolina towns , Tryon or Goldsboro , where after the funeral in an empty weedy cemetery they would head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch.  |p130Marion  , animated by a kind of holy vivacity , would eat the $2.95 buffet , heaping up mountains of mashed potatoes and pork chops , and go back for seconds , pleased by both the cheapness and the quantity of food . Like many rich women , she loved a bargain . All the while he gazed in bemusement at the ragged Southern cemetery , empty except for the Rolls , the hearse , Yamaiuchi , and three Asheville morticians ( he was usually the fourth pallbearer for the casket light with its wispy burden ) , and then gazed around the bustling new Holiday Inn and the local businessmen come to eat . Live men and dead men . The shotgun lay beside the man on the wet speckled leaves . In his father 's eyes he saw a certitude . He had come into focus . How does it happen that a man can go through his life standing up , not himself and dreaming , eating business lunches and passing his wife in the hall , that it is only when he lies bleeding in a swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside him ? " What ? " He gave a start . The chaplain was saying something . " I said when I come over tomorrow , perhaps you and I and Leslie can have a little powwow . About this ah do-it-yourself wedding . " " Sure . " " I want to get your old friend Mrs. Huger in on it too . I have a feeling she can handle Leslie . She 's quite a lady . " He was looking down at his hand . A shaft of light struck it . The yellow light , refracted by the prism , shaded into blue and red on his skin like a bruise . It was still possible to feel the buck of the Luger in the bones of his wrist . " You 're so lucky Mrs. Huger turned up when she did , Will . You 've no idea how helpful she 's been . Is n't she an old flame of yours ? She 's a doll . Did you know she 's my main contact with Leslie and the groom 's family ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Who ? " " Mrs. Huger . Your old  --  " Oh , Kitty . Kitty Vaught Huger . My old flame . What in hell was Kitty doing up here ? She and her grinning dentist/husband . They were everywhere , all over the golf course and in his house . Kitty had a woman 's managerial way with her . For a fact she had been helpful . Even Yamaiuchi liked her . Last Saturday when the Cupps flew in from California she and Yamaiuchi had fixed the hors d'oeuvre . What did she want ? What did her husband want ? Like many people who want something , he had a way of coming at you from the side and grinning back to his eyeteeth . Both came closer than people usually do . When they greeted you , they fell forward and laid hands on you . When Kitty touched him , he felt showers of gooseflesh but not exactly excitement . It was the sort of goosefleshyou feel when a child , not knowing about such things , puts his hands on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought of sitting next to her in the Alabama twilight in her father 's Lincoln , her knees together , eyes cast down , silent ; crossing lonesomered-clay railroad cuts filled with ironweed and violet light . But now she came shouldering up to him . She was bolder , lustier , better-looking but almost brawny , a lady golfer , brown and freckle-shouldered . Her voice was deeper , a musical whiskey-mellowed country-club voice with a laugh he did n't remember . When she sat , she straddled good-naturedly , opening her knees . When she leaned toward him , her heavy gold jewelry clunked . He was sitting in the Mercedes looking at the Luger . It was getting dark . A few old people were in the Kennedy rockers on the front porch , but most were inside watching giantscreenTV . Mr. Arnold , one of Marion 's patients who had come to the house , spied him and tried to say something , but one side of his face was pulled down and his lips blew out like a curtain . One hand was fisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other arm . The Luger felt good . Its weight and ugliness and beauty made him smile . He shook his head fondly . Why did he feel good ? Was it because for the first time in his life he could suddenly see what had happened to his father , exactly where he was right and where he was wrong ? Right : you said I will not put up with a life which is not life or death . I do n't have to and I wo n't . Right , old mole , and if you were here in richp132reborn Christian Carolina with its condos and 450 SELs and old folks rolling pills and cackling at Hee Haw , you would n't put up with that either . Ah , but what if there is another way ? Maybe that was your mistake , that you did n't even look . That 's the difference between us . I 'm going to find out once and for all . You never even looked . Is there another way ? People either believe everything or they believe nothing . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People like you and Lewis Peckhamand the professors and scientists believe nothing . Is there another way ? He hefted the Luger . His father took it off an SS colonel , it and the colonel 's black cap with its Totenkopf insignia and some photographs  --  his father : a captain in the loth Armored Division , which joined Patton at Saarburg , where he , his father , had his picture taken standing up in the hatch of an M4 Sherman tank , which did not look at all like the snapshot of the SS colonel standing in the hatch of the Tiger tank taken in the Ardennes ( even though I somehow know it was exactly what he , my father , had in mind when he had his picture taken : the Tiger in all its menacing beauty ) . Strange that he , my father , often spoke of the Ardennes and the Rhine and Weimar but never mentioned Buchenwald , which was only four miles from Weimar and which Patton took three weeks later , never mentioned that the horrified Patton paraded fifteenhundred of Weimar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the sights , Patton of all people , no Goethe he who said to the fifteen hundred not look you sons of Goethe but look you sons of bitches ( is not this in fact , Father , where your humanism ends in the end ? ) . Yet he , my father , never mentioned that , even though I read about it in his own book , a history of the Third Army , that the loth Armored Division was there too . Why did he keep the photographs of the SS colonel standing in the hatch of the Tiger tank which I found in the attic in Mississippi and not one word about Buchenwald ? Why did he talk about the SS colonel so much if the Nazis were so bad and why did he thinkp133Patton not the SS colonel ridiculous with his chrome helmet and pearl-handled revolvers ? He talked about the SS colonel as much as he talked about Marcus Flavinius , the Roman centurion . He knew by heart the letter which Marcus had written his cousin Tertullus in Rome , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with moneygrubbings , plots , treasons , sellouts . He , Marcus , wrote : When we left our native soil , Tertullus , we were told we were going to defend the sacred rights of the empire and of the people to whom we bring our protection and civilization . For this we have not hesitated to shed our blood , to sacrifice our youth and our hopes . We regret nothing . Please tell me the rumors I hear of treachery at home are not true and that our fellow citizens understand us , support us , protect our families as we ourselves protect the might of the Empire . Should it be otherwise , Tertullus , should we leave our weary bones to bleach on the tracts of the desert in vain , then beware of the anger of the Legions . Marcus FlaviniusCenturion of the Second Cohort of the Augusta Legion SPQRAnger . That was it ! His anger ! You were possessed by anger , anger which in the end you turned on yourself . You loved only death because for you what passed for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is worse than death . Is that what you envied the SS colonel , his death's-head ? Very well , perhaps you were right , but what if you were not ? Did you look ? What if there is a sign ? What about the Jews ? Are the Jews a sign ? And if so , a sign of what ? Did you overlook something ? There were the Romans , the Augusta Legion , yes . There was the Army of Northern Virginia , yes . There was the Afrika Korps , yes . But what about the Jews ? Did you andp134the centurion overlook the Jews ? What did you make of what happened to them ? What to make , Father , of the Jews ? He smiled again . What to make , reader , of a rich middle-aged American sitting in a German car , holding a German pistol with which he will in all probability blow out his brains , smiling to himself and looking around old Carolina for the Jews whom he imagined had all disappeared ? Somehow he had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed in the Holocaust or had returned to Israel . The missing Jews were the sign his father had missed ! What would have happened if a bona fide North Carolina Jew had walked up to the car and introduced himself ? Now he was talking aloud to himself : Father , the difference between you and me is that you were so angry you wanted no part of the way this life is and yourself in it and me in it too . You aimed only to make an end and you did . Very well , perhaps you were right . But I aim to find out . There 's the difference . I aim to find out once and for all . I wo n't have it otherwise , you settled for too little . He had waited too long . The chaplain , leaving St. Mark 's , spied him and caught him before he could start the Mercedes . For a moment he was afraid the chaplain was going to get in the car but he leaned in the window . In the second his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Luger under his thigh . " Will ! I 'm glad I caught you . I forgot the main thing I wanted to ask you . " He tapped his temple . " The mind is going . " " Yes ? " " I 'm giving a retreat at Montreat next week . It crossed my mind you might come along . " " A what ? " " A religious retreat . It 's our regular yearly number . And our regular gang . Actually a wonderful bunch of guys . A weekend with God in a wonderful setting . It 's an ecumenicalp135retreat . I 'm double-teamed with a Roman Catholic priest from Brooklyn , a real character  --  he looks so much like Humphrey Bogart everybody calls him Bogey . What a card . They call me I lungry Jack . Hungry Jack and Bogey . Actually we 're not had together . Incidentally , the food 's first-class . But the important thing 's it 's a weekend with God . That 's the bottom line . " " Leslie tells me I should do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a personal encounter . Leslie believes she has had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ and has been born again . " " There you go . " " There I go what ? " " There are many mansions and so forth . It 's not my gig but if it 's hers , more power to her . " " What does that mean ? " " Why do n't you come to the retreat and find out . We 've got all kinds in our gang  --  Protestants , Catholics , Anglicans , unbelievers , Jews  --  all wonderful guys , the kind of guys you 'd like to spend a weekend with or fishing or just shooting the breeze . We call ourselves the Montreat Mafia . They 're darn good guys and I promise you 'd like  --  " " Did you say Jews ? " " Yes . Last year we had two Jews . One a judge , the other  --  " " What kind of Jews ? " " What do you mean , what kind ? " " I mean were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know . I did n't inquire . " " Where are they from ?

" " Will you tell me something , Jack ? " " You better believe it . " " Do you think the Jews are a sign ? " " The Jews ? " Again the quick second look . He did say Jews . And he is smiling . Are we kidding ?  | " Marion thought the Jews , the strange history of the Jews , was a sign of God 's existence . What do you think ? " " Oh wow . With all due respect to Marion , God rest her soul , hopefully we 've gotten past the idea that God keeps the Jews around suffering to avenge Christ 's death . " " I did n't mean that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exodus from North Carolina . " Then it 's a joke , said the chaplain 's smile . But what 's the joke ? Better take out insurance against it not being a joke . " Well , to tell you the truth , I 'm less interested in signs of the apocalypse than in opening a serious dialogue with our Catholic and Jewish friends , and I can tell you we 've gotten right down to some real boilerplate at Montreat  --  will you think about it ? " " I just thought about it . " " We 're leaving here next Thursday , by early afternoon hopefully . " " I would hope that you would go in hope . " " Eh ? " said the chaplain cocking an ear . " Right . Well , anyway  --  " " Do you believe in God ? " Will Barrett asked with the same smile . " How 's that ? " asked Jack quickly . " You know , God . " In the fading light the chaplain looked at him closely , smilingall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Jack Curl wished that Will Barrett would not smile . The chaplain 's main fear was not of being attacked or even martyred  --  he thought he could handle it  --  but of being made a fool of . It was one thing to be hauled up before the Grand Inquisitor , scorned , ridiculed , tortured . He could handle that , but suppose one is made the butt of a joke and does n't get the joke ? He wished Will Barrett , who seldom smiled , would stop smiling . In the fading yellow light he could see the chaplain eyeing him uneasily to see if he was joking . " I 'm trying to ask a serious question . That is difficult to do these days . " " You can say that again . Fire away . "  |p137The  Luger was hard under his thigh . Jack Curl 's face loomed pale in the darkness . " Do you believe in God , Jack ? " In the fading light he could see the chaplain look at him swiftly as if there were a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making him look white-eyed and serious . " Well , if I did n't , I 'd say I needed some vocational counseling , would n't you ? " The chaplain 's head loomed in the Mercedes , his face large and solemn . " Seriously  --  and you can check me out on this  --  I seem to be picking up on some vibes from you lately  --  that you might be thinking of entering the church  --  am I out in left field ? I was lying a while ago when I said the one thing Marion wanted most was her new communityproject . No , what she wanted more than anything else was your coming into the church . " " Ah . " " Do you know where I 've found God , Will ? " The chaplain'sround face rose to the Mercedes roof like a balloon . " No , where ? " " In other people . " " I see . " " Do n't you think you belong here in the church ? With your own people . This is where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My people ? " " Were n't they all Episcopalians ? " " Yes . " My people ? Yes , they were Episcopalians but at heart they were members of the Augusta Legion and in the end at home not at St. John o ' the Woods but with the bleached bones of Centurion Marcus Flavinius on the desert of the old Empire . They were the Romans , the English , Angles , Saxons , Jutescitizensof Rome in the old Empire . " Do n't you think you belong with us ? " " Ah . " The Luger thrust into his thigh like a thumb . He smiled . Not yet , old Totenkopf . " You did n't answer my ques-tion . " " What was the question ? "  | " Do you believe God exists ? " " Yes , " said the chaplain gravely . The chaplain 's face , he imagined , went keen and fine-eyed in the failing light . Could it be ? the lively expression asked . A God-seeker ? A man wrestlingwith Doubt ? ( He , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " " Perhaps he is trying to tell you something at this moment , " said the chaplain solemnly . ( God , do n't let me blow this , I 've got a live one hooked . ) " What ? " " Grace is a mysterious thing , " said the chaplain . " What does that mean ? " " Perhaps the answer lies under our noses , so to speak , in fact within ourselves . If only we would take the trouble to ask the question . " " I shall put the question  --  as a matter of form  --  and I shall require an answer . But the answer will not come from you or me , " he said softly . " What 's that ? " asked the chaplain quickly , leaning in . " I did n't quite catch  --  " " I said only that the question can be put in such a way that an answer is required . It will be stipulated , moreover , that a non-answer , silence , shall be construed to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaplain uneasily . It made him uneasy to talk about religion . Marion Peabody Barrett had terrified him with her raging sarcastic attacks on the new liturgy and his own " social gospel . " There is a time to talk religion with women , to be God 's plumber , to have solemn yet joyous bull sessions with men during a weekend with God , to horse around at a party . He was at home doing any of these but not when they were mixed up . The trouble with Barrett 's queer question and peculiar smile was that you could n't say which he was doing . The truth was Barrett was a queer duck . Rich , powerful , of one 's class , but queer . Sly . What to do , then ? Listen . Listen with all your might . Determine whether he 's kidding or not . The chaplain narrowed his eyes and leaned several degrees toward Barrett.  | " I think I know how to ask such a question , " said Will Barrett . That was your trouble , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should have , if only from . Episcopal rectitude and an Episcopal sense of form  --  as one asks routinely of an empty house before closing the door and leaving : Is anybody home ? The question should be put as a matter of form even though you know the house is empty . Then no one can complain of your leaving . To his relief the chaplain pushed himself away , gave the Mercedes top a slap with both hands . " Why do n't you put your question on the retreat ? " " I 'll give it some thought . " " Give it some prayerful thought . " " Very well . I 'll see you tomorrow . You deliver Mr. Arnold because Marion would want that and I 'll try to deliver Leslie because that 's what you want . " " You got yourself a deal . " When he moved his thigh and picked up the Luger between his legs , the metal felt hotter than his own body . The glass doors of St. Mark 's closed behind the chaplain . Closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why everything looked so clear . He knew he would not come here again . When you leave a house for the last time and take one last look around before closing the door , it is as if you were seeing the house again for the first time . What happened to the five thousand times between ? He had not known who the girl in the greenhouse was until Kitty told him twice , once before the girl ran away from the sanatorium and again afterwards . But even when he found out and at the same time saw that Kitty did not know where her daughter was , he could not bring himself to pay close attention . Something else engaged him even as Kitty and her grinningdentist husband and grinning Jimmy Rogers pressed in upon him . They wanted something from him . It was clear butp140not from what they said . They were telling jokes and saying something about property , Arabs , money , state laws about guardianship and inheritance , developing an island . An island ? Though he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neck when someone wants something and is casting about for a way to ask . Not finding a way , they move closer , heads weaving like a boxer 's , looking for an opening . What did they want ? Money ? Free legal advice ? Both ? It seemed to be Kitty who wanted it most . At least she came closest , touched , hugged , kissed , poked , jostled , swayed against , jangled , shimmered . What did she want ? Though he faced the husband , now not three feet away , it was hard to take in more than the grin , white teeth , styled hair , pink clothes . Instead he gazed past them , past the white wicker and stuffed linen furniture , the lacquered ivory-colored tables , blue porcelain lamps  --  it was Marion 's Chinese Export blueand-whiteroom , what in the South used to be called a sun parlor  --  to Leslie and the Cupps and Jack Curl , past Lewis Peckham the golf pro listening politely to Bertie , Bertie makinggrips on an invisible golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the huge Louis XV secretary with its doors open to show the decoupage panels , to the bank of windows broad as a ship 's bridge opening onto a short steep yard dropping off to the gorge and the valley beyond . A gazebo perched on the lip of the gorge . A twist of cloud , thick as cotton , rose from the gorge behind the gazebo and a small scarlet oak he had never noticed before . It was stunted and lopsided and black . The few leaves that had n't fallen hung straight down as if they had been tied on by a child . The white gazebo was almost whited out by the cloud . From beyond the post oak in the silent swamp came the geclick of the Greener breech being broken and presently the gecluck of its closing . That was when you reloaded.  |p141But  you had only shot once , at the first single . You had another shell . Why not wait until the second shot at the second single to reload ? Because you knew you only needed three shots , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . There were four empty Winchester Super-X shells afterwards , three on the quilt beside him in the Negro cabin where he was lying after the woman wiped the blood from his face , and a fourth in the Greener the guide had brought back with the shells . The cabin smelled of kerosene and flour paste . Newspapers were freshly pasted on the walls . But there were only three shots . Wait a minute . Is it possible to fire both barrels of the Greener at once ? There were two triggers . " Wait a minute , " he said aloud . Then he smiled and shrugged . What difference did it make ? The three Arabs were pressing in upon him . That 's what they looked like , Arabs : the dentist , Jimmy Rogers , and Bertie : brown-skinned , coming too close , smiling , nodding  --  Jimmy Rogers was even rubbing his hands together . " Excuse me , " he said . " I have to go upstairs and tend to some business . " " What business ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shower of goosebumps , a peculiar but not unpleasant sensation . " I 'm looking for an old shotgun . " He noticed absently that it had become possible to tell the truth , that it was no longer necessary to make an excuse , go fix a drink . " What are you going to do , shoot us ? " asked Kitty with a mock falling away . She told the others : " He was always like that , ready to have a shoot-out if somebody crossed him , right here and now . " No , I was n't always like that . " That was the way it was where we came from , was n't it , Will ? " " I was going to look for an old shotgun that belonged to my father and grandfather . " " You did n't mess with them either , " Kitty told the others.  | " Where we came from , if you fell out with somebody , you did n't smile at them and go around behind their backs . You called them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . We call ourselves out and have it out with ourselves . Famous one-man shoot-outs . " I keep a shotgun loaded with double-ought buckshot under my bed , " said the grinning dentist-husband . " I fixed a rack just inside the rail . All I got to do is reach down with one hand . Just let some sapsucker come in the door or window . Just let him come . I know a man , a substantial man no redneck , who just the other day bought a shotgun and a .357 Magnum and two cases of shells , and he 's a college graduate , not one of your nuts . " The grin , he noticed , went back to the eyeteeth . What 's this guy so angry about ? His wife ? Being a dentist ? His daughter ? No wonder his daughter 's nuts . Who does he want to shoot ? Probably niggers . " Speaking of the Wild West , guns , and shoot-outs , " said Jimmy Rogers , coming even closer , close as a lover , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his jokes . Though he tried to listen to the joke , his mind wandered . Jimmy pulled him close and then gave him a final little tug . The joke must be over . " I have to go , " he said . " Hold on , son , " said Kitty , but it was she who held on , laughing and grabbing his arm with both hands , wrists all aglint and ajangle with gold . There was about her a rushing way he did n't remember of coming close and pushing ahead of her the smell of her hair and a perfume  --  Shalimar ? How did he remember after all these years ? It smelled like Shalimar sounded  --  and a friendly kind of jostling , jostling him with arm , shoulder , elbow , hip , hair swinging past the hollow of his throat . What he did remember , not he but his body , was the warmth in the places where she touched him . It was curious . Spots she touched grew warm as if he had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hold it , son . I need to have a word with you . " Curious ! Something was both strange and familiar . Suddenly he realized he had not thought about women for a long time , not since Marion 's death , not since long before Marion 's death  --  except for the time hep143thought about Ethel Rosenblum and fell down in a bunker . For three years he had lived in a dream of golf and good works . " What ? " he said , turning an ear down to her upraised face . She wanted to whisper something . The Arabs fell back , stopped smiling , bent forward in a huddle , made plans . " Look , Will . The summerhouse is lost in the cloud . " " Yes , it is . " " Do you realize what hiappened to us ? " " No , what ? " " We passed each other like ships in a fog . I was a fool . I should have grabbed you when I could . " " As it has turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go get lost in t he fog , " she whispered . She could n't quite whisper but like a child trying to whisper sputtered in his ear . His hair raised . H e nodded . " Could you meet me in the summerhouse ? " she asked . " I have a bug to put in your ear . " Welts sprang out on his neck . " There 's something I have to do . " " What ? " " I have to find the shotgun . " " I do n't mean now . I mean after dinner . After the others leave . Is there a side door ? " " Yes . " " I 'll go out the front door to get a breath of air . You go a different way . You 're always dropping out anyway . You know what Marion said about you ? " " No , what ? " " You were just not there half the time . But what she did n't understand , and what you and I do , is that now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? " " I suppose . " " Very well . Can you keep me from the foggy foggy dew ? " " Sure , " he said absently . This time when she jostled , she managed to sidle and give him a friendly kidding hip-bump such as you used to do in high school corridors or playing basketball.  |p144His  body seemed to remember something and , turning toward her , confronted hers like a man moving in his sleep . The cloud had come over the cliff . As it came up the short steep yard it seemed to thin and turn into fog . Wisps of fog curled around the tree , which looked more and more like a common Mississippi scrub oak than a stylish Carolina scarlet oak . Before they came to the tree his father said : There are two singles . You take one and I 'll take the other . Then they went ahead until the tree came between them . One single got up , the one on the man 's side of the tree . He had hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the first shot came blotting out everything in the shockroar which went racketing through the swamp . His father always shot on the rise . Before he could reach the door , his daughter stopped him . Her face was cross , the frowning U cut deep in her forehead . " You 've got to get that shaman off my back . " " Who ? " " Father what's-his-name . " " Oh , Jack . " " Yep . He 's getting on my nerves . Tell Jack he 's not marryingme and Jason . We 're marrying each other . " " Okay . Anything else ? " " The only reason we 're doing this here is that I promised Mother . " " Okay . I have to go . " " Go ? Where ? " Her glasses flashed . " You 're not pulling anotherfade-out . " " Fade-out ? " He tried to focus on her . " That little number you do , now you see me now you do n't  --  though I 'll give you this much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug , still frowning  --  " you always turned up when I needed you . " " Not this time . " " What ? " " Nothing . " I 'll be damned , he thought . Nothing changes . Am I doing top145her exactly what he did to me , leaving her ? But there 's a difference . She does n't need me . And for a fact she had already turned away , her frowning crossed-up face thrust toward Jack Curl and the Cupps . " Wait , " he said . " What ? " she said , stopping but not turning toward him . " Ah  --  well . " Ah well . Yes . That 's it . Maybe there had been a time when there was something to say and maybe the time would come again , but it was not now . " What ? " said Leslie . " Goodbye , " he said . " What ? " she asked vacantly and nodded . " Okay . " She nodded again , eyes fixed in a stare . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . " Oh , Poppy , " said Leslie , turning back and giving him a cheek hug but still frowning past him . She had n't heard him . Just before he turned away , he took a last look at her . Is it possible to see someone here and now ? Her hair was perfectly straight , a long shining fan spread across her shoulders , as bright and clean as a happy child 's . She was a child , hardly more . But when she turned , her face was cross and thrusting , moving in a kind of tic against her hair . When he looked at her , the flashing granny glasses , the inverted U on her forehead , the chewed lip , she slid away from him back in time and he seemed to see her as a child when he passed her in the foyer on 76th Street on her way to Central Park with the nurse , she giving him the same quick fretful cheek hug , and then slid away again but forward in her own time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . . . Are women beside themselves from the beginning ? In the upstairs study , built with a widow 's walk above it like a Nantucket house , he found the Greener in a broom closet behind the Electrolux and the waxer . The straps and bucklesp146of the old stiff scuffed case were hard to undo . He gazed at the gun . It was one of four things he had saved from Mississippi . The other three were the Luger , his grandfather 's Ivanhoe , and his father 's Lord Jim . It figured . Both his grandfather and his father had enemies . One , like Ivanhoe , had enemies he hated . The other had the guilts like Jim and an enemy he hated , himself . And one had the shotgun , the other the Luger . What do you do when you are born with a love of death and deathdealingand have no enemies ? He had not looked at the shotgun or Lord Jim or Ivanhoe for twenty years . Fitting barrel into stock , he clicked it out straight and snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he remembered , short as a carbine , both barrels cylinderbore . God , no wonder they were good shots . How could you miss anything with a cannon full of birdshot ? The metal was not rusty but the bluing had long since worn away to greasy steel . Only a faint design , fine as scrollwork on money , remained . He broke the breech and sighted at the windows through the barrels . White light from the cloud came spinning down the mirrored bore . There was a faint reek of gun oil and powder from the last shot . Who had cleaned the gun ? the sheriff ? I ? I. On the rib between the barrels he read : W. W. Greener , 68 Haymarket , London . Best in all trials 1875-1888 . The grip was worn smooth as a police pistol . The wood of the forestock had shrunk around the bone ornament like an old man 's muscle . He closed the breech , hefted the gun , sighted it again , pulled the two triggers , first one then the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the breech to cock the firing pins . Again he pulled both triggers . I 'll be damned . You can fire both barrels at once . Wait a minute . You shot the single . There were two singles . That left one shell for the other single . But you reloaded . Why ? Why did n't you wait for the second single and the second shot before reloading ? But you reloaded , then swung around to track the secondp147single , swung so far around and so intent on the tracking that you forgot I was there , did n't see me through the post oak , and got me too . Then you reloaded again with one shell . Because one shell was all you needed . Wait a minute . There were four empty shells , three the guide had picked up and put on the quilt beside me in the Negro cabin , and one in the breech of the Greener . " Here yo bullets , " the guide said , not even knowing that spent shells are worthless . Wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second single . Why ? You do n't unload two Super-X 's on one small quail . Wait a minute . There was no second single . If there had been , I 'd remember , because I remember everything now . I 'd have heard him get up before you shot , heard the sudden tiny thunder . I knew that all along . Why did n't I know that I knew it ? Then both barrels were for me , were n't they ? Well , I 'll be damned . No wonder the Greener spit fire and smoke like a cannon . So that was it . Will could not take his eyes from the shotgun . An electric shock seemed to pass into his body from the greasy metal clamped in both hands like an electrode . A violent prickling went up his back and into his hairline . His diaphragm contracted . He found that he had laughed . Well , I 'll be damned . Is it possible that I knew it all along and until this moment did not know that I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I killed and until this moment did not know it ? Can you be only technically alive ? Well , as you used to say , it 's a different ball game now , is n't it ? Hm . Why do I feel relieved , even dispensed , as if somehow I were now free to do what I am going to do ? Smiling , he turned the carbine-length shotgun , swinging the muzzle toward him . Easily done : you can even put both thumbs on both triggers.  |p148Let  me get it straight now . You shot the first single . Then you broke the breech , removed the one spent shell , and reloaded . Then you fired both barrels . Then you broke the breech , ejected the two , and reloaded , but with one shell . One shell for the single , two for me , one for you . Then how did you nearly miss me ? You could n't miss a quail on the wing with one barrel at fifty feet . Yet you nearly missed me with both barrels at fifteenfeet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pulled up ? Was it love or failure of love ? And how did you miss yourself ? Well , whatever the reason , you corrected it the next time , did n't you ? In the attic , in Mississippi . But why did n't you take me with you then , if you knew something and were that sure you knew it ? The sorrow in your eyes when I came over and sat beside you in Georgia  --  were you sorry you did it or sorry you did n't ? He was smiling down at the shotgun and shaking his head . Sorry you did n't do it . Because the next time you took no chances and did it right , used both barrels , both thumbs and your mouth . I remember now . I cleaned the gun when I got it back from the sheriff in Mississippi . Both barrels . Would n't one have been enough ? Yes , given an ordinary need for death . But not if it 's a love of death . In the case of love , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and most is best of all . And if the aim is the ecstasy of love , two is closer to infinity than one , especially when the two are twelve-gauge Super-X numbereightshot . And what samurai self-love of death , let alone the little death of everyday fuck-you love , can match the double Winchester come of taking oneself into oneself , the cold-steel extension of oneself into mouth , yes , for you , for me , for us , the logical and ultimate act of fuck-you love fuck-off world ,  |p149the  penetration and union of perfect cold gunmetal into warm quailing mortal flesh , the coming to end all coming , brain cells which together faltered and fell short , now flowered and flew apart , flung like stars around the whole dark world . " Going hunting ? " " No . " It was Lewis Peckham standing in the doorway behind him . He wondered if anything could surprise him . " I got an old cornfield the hogs have been into .

" You do seem better . What was it ? " He looked at Lewis . It was unusual for him to ask questions . " It was something I did n't know that was bothering me . Now I know . " " I could tell you how to correct your slice , but that 's not it , is it ? " " No . " Lewis Peckham 's face , narrow and dark as a piece of slab bark , was as usual slightly averted .

It had at first appeared that Lewis was a natural man , one of the few left , a grave watchful silent courteous man , a Leather/stocking . But he was not . He was a discontent golf pro . He looked like a Cherokee scout but his family was old-line Tidewaterand he had played golf at the University of Virginia . He was an unhappy golf pro . Maybe books had ruined him . What a shock to learn from this grave silent man that he wrote poetry in secret ! Imagine Leatherstocking a poet .

He had taken a degree in English , taught English , fought in a war , returned to teach English , could n't , decided to farm , bought a goat farm , managed a Confederate museum in a cave on his property , wrote poetry , went broke , became a golf pro . Lewis showed him some of his poetry once . It was not good . There was one poem called " New Moon over Khe Sanh , " which was typed in the shape of a new moon : Theroundsincomingbright sliverof moon reflected in foul funkhole bright sliver of metal destined formy brain is noCarolinamoonNoHow could Lewis , who could locate others so well , so misplacehimself ? How could he read signs and people so well , yet want to be a third-rate Rupert Brooke with his rendezvous with death at Khe Sanh ? Why would he even want to be a first-rate Rupert Brooke ? On the other hand , what was Lewis supposed to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf pro ? run a Confederate cave ? Lewis did n't seemp151to know . But what was good about him was that he remained himself despite himself . Books had not spoiled him . He knew a great deal he had n't learned from books . The trouble was he did n't set store by it . Will Barrett smiled . All at once he knew what Lewis was supposed to do and what would make him happy . After all the local Angles and Jutes and Saxons have driven each other crazy over niggers and gone to war for lack of anything better to do , Lewis is the fellow who keeps his head and goes around picking up people with his pickup and saving a remnant in his cave . " You 're sure you 're okay , Will ? " " Sure . " " You want to know what I think ? " " Yes . " " I think you 're in a clinical depression . I believe you might do with some counseling . Have you heard of logotherapy ? " Logotherapy . Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goatherd , spelunker , poet , golf pro , now a psychiatrist . Lewis inclined his head gravely . " The trouble is you and I share something that sets us apart . " " What 's that ? " " We 're the once-born in a world of the twice-born . We have to make our way without Amazing Grace . It 's a lonely road but there are some advantages along the way . The company , when you find it , is better . And the view , though bleak , is bracing . You see things the way they are . In fact , do n't you feel sometimes like the one-eyed in the land of the blind ? " He frowned . Why was Lewis 's unbelief so unpleasant ? It was no better than the Baptists ' belief . If belief is shitty and unbelief is shitty , what does that leave ? No , Lewis was even more demented than the believers . UnbelievingLewis read Dante for the structure . At least , believerswere consistent . They might think Dante is a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you considered analysis , Will ? " " Analysis of what ? " " Of you . Psychoanalysis . "  | " I did that . Three years of it . " " Analysis ? No kidding . " Lewis brightened . Lewis thought better of him ! Lewis envied him ! Lewis wanted to be analyzed ! ' Then you of all people should know that depression is eminently treatable , right ? " Lewis waited , not quite watching him , as grave and courteousas if he were waiting for a putt . " Maybe you 're right . " " Of course I 'm right . What is more , you know as well as I do that such a reaction is quite common following the death of a spouse . " A spouse . Marion was a spouse . But did Marion 's death depresshim or mystify him ? " Also , if you want to know the truth , Will , I think you retired too soon . " " May be , " he said absently . " Early retirement is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right ? " He took a good look at Lewis , at the dark slab-sided face and straight black hair which was too long for a golf pro and too short for a poet . There was a space in him where a space should n't be , where parts were not glued together . What it was was that there is nothing wrong with being a goatherdpoet-golf-probut there was something wrong with the way Lewis did it . What ? " After all , Will , you got it all . You got everything a man needs . And you 're a good athlete . You could play scratch golf if you put your mind to it . " " What would you do if you had it all , Lewis ? " " I 'd raise beef cattle , listen to Beethoven and Wagner , read and write , " said Lewis without hesitation . Two fingers strayed along the greasy steel of the Greener barrel . " You do n't enjoy such things , Will ? " " Sure . " Lewis touched his arm , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell you what , Will . They do n't need the father of the bride around here . Let 's me and you cut out , gop153down to my spread , crack a bottle , and put on the Ninth Symphony . " " No thanks , Lewis . " Dear Jesus . Sitting with Lewis in his farmhouse , listening to the Ninth Symphony . " Name one thing better than the Ninth Symphony . " Kitty 's ass . " I 'm not in the mood . " He looked at his watch . What did Kitty have in mind ? " You and I know that golf is not enough . " " Right . " " You could n't do without them any more than I can , Will . " " Do without what ? " " The finer things in life . " " Right . " " Man does not live by bread alone and we make plenty bread at golf . " " Right . " Why was it that the thought of the finer things in life , such as the Ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a fact , the Ninth Symphony was one of the finer things . On the other hand , Lewis 's proposal was so demented he had to laugh : he and this solemn poet-golf-pro music lover listening to the Ode to Joy of an afternoon in old Carolina . " You want to know what I 've decided over the years , Will ? " " What ? " " I 've decided the worst thing that can happen to a man is to lose his heritage . " What heritage ? Tidewater unbeliever who had read Dante six times for the structure , could draw the circles of hell , the platforms of purgatory , and the rose of heaven ? When you came down to it , Lewis took Erich Fromm more seriously than God , Dante , or Virginia . Was this not madness pure and simple , to come from Tidewater Virginia , read about Dante and God , read the terza rimy aloud with such admiration that tears came to his eyes  --  and top it off with Erich Fromm ? " I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty 's ass . " I promised Marion to get Leslie married up proper . " " Yes . What a lovely girl . That reminds me . This may make you laugh but it 's something I promised Marion . " " What 's that ? "  | " Before she died Marion asked me to tell you something . " " What 's that ? " " Funny she would n't tell you . You and Marion did n't communicatemuch , did you ? " " No , we did n't communicate much . We had what you call a communication breakdown . " Lewis laughed , himself again despite himself . " Marriage is hell , ai n't it ? Cindy is a wonderful wife but she has n't grown . " " That 's too bad . " Grown to what ? " What was it you were supposed to tell me ? " " Oh , Marion said : just make sure he gets to the wedding and all , that if he wants to pull one of his little fade-outs , she 's not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " She knew you pretty well , Will . " " Yes . " " I told her , shit , Will will be there , do n't worry about it . " " You did n't say shit to Marion . " " No , I did n't . " " Right . " " You wo n't come down later to crack a bottle and listen to some music ? I just got the whole Ring . " " No . " Jesus , no . " Or shoot doves . Or sit in the cave . Or whatever . " " The cave ? Shoot doves ? " A strange thought flew into his head . He looked at Lewis . " Okay . I will . " After Lewis left , he stood for a moment looking down at the Greener . For the second time in a week , he remembered a movie actor he had only heard of once . No , he did n't even remember the actor . He remembered his father remember the actor as they were driving in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . At the end of the continent they found themselves driving down Sunset Boulevard in his father 's big black 4-hole Dynaflow Buick . His father , who had not spoken for a thousand miles , said : " You see that corner ? " " Yes sir . " " Once I was here before . " " Is that right ? " " I was here for the Olympics of 1932 . On that corner I saw an actor by the name of Ross Alexander . It was before his death . " " Is that so ? " " One night he was giving a party at his house . In thep155middle of the party he got up and said I think I 'll go outside and shoot a duck . No one thought anything of this announcement . He went outside to the garage and shot himself . No one thought much of that either . Similar events were occurring in Rome in 450 before its sack by the Vandals . " " Is that right ? " Will Barrett snapped the leather case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electrolux . " What a wonderful person your wife was , " said Kitty . " Yes , she was . " They were watching his daughter Leslie as she talked with Mr. Arnold from the nursing home . Despite his stroke he could get around with a walker . One fierce eye gazed around the room under a small bald head white as an onion . One side of his face was shut down . Eyelid , cheek , lip fell like a curtain . " Marion was a saint in this world , " said Kitty . " Yes . " " And you were so wonderful with her . I 've seen you pushingher in the A &; P , helping her in and out of the car . " " Yes . " " If she had n't been so heavy , she would have been a lovely woman . " " Yes . " No . Marion was not lovely , even before she got " heavy , " never had been lovely except for her good gray eyes and heavy wide winged eyebrows . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? because she was Bertie 's sister and Bertie owned the firm and Marion owned forty million dollars ? No , he married her , had n't he ? because she was touching , with her not too bad polio limp , and even pretty in a gawky Yankeefied way  --  even now when he thought of her at Northport , he saw her in a blue middy blouse  --  middy blouse ? was such a thing possible , was it in a photograph , or did he imagine it ?  --  and her direct gray-eyed gaze a whole world removedp156from a Sweetbriar girl or a Carolina coed who had six different ways of looking at you and with all six had seen you coming before you saw her . No , he married her because he pleased her so much . It is not a small thing to be able to make someone happy so easily . No , he married her for the very outlandishness of it , marryingher in Northport being as far as he could get from where he had come from . No , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Episcopal Christian and wanted him to be one too and he tried and even imagined he believed it  --  again for the very outlandishness of it , taking for his own a New York Episcopal view of an Anglican view of a Roman view of a Jewish Happening . Might it not be true for this very reason ? Could anybody but God have gotten away with such outlandishness , contriving to have rich Long Island Episcopalianswho if they had no use for anything had no use for Jews , worship a Jew ? No , he married her for none of these reasons and for all of them . Marry her for money and the firm ? Yes and no . Marry her because he could make her happy ? Yes and no . Marry her because she was as far away as he could get from Mississippi ? Yes and no . And from you , old mole ? Yes . And get Jesus Christ in the bargain ? Why not ? Yes , it was all of these but most of all it was the offhandednessand smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all and even going the Gospels one better because the Gospels spoke of the children of this world and the children of light and set one against the other and he was both and had both and why not ? Why not marry her ? Was n't it possible to believe in God like Pascal 's coldbloodedbettor , because there was everything to gain if you were right and nothing to lose if you were wrong ? For a while it seemed that it was possible . Then it seemed not to matter . In all honesty it was easier to believe it in cool Long Island for its very outrageousness where nobody believed anything very seriously than in hot Carolina where everybody was a Christian and found unbelief unbelievable.  |p157After  he married Marion , she seemed happier than ever , gave herself to church work , doing so with pleasure , took pleasure in him  --  and suddenly took pleasure in eating . She married , gave herself to good works , heaved a great sigh of relief , and began to eat . She ate and ate and ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made frail and porous by polio . The ball of her femur drove into the socket of her pelvis , melted , and fused . She took to a wheelchair , ate more than ever , did more good works . She spent herself for the poor and old and wretched of North Carolina . She was one of the good triumphant Yankees who helped out the poor old South . In and out of meetings flew her wheelchair , her arms burly as a laborer 's . Fueled by holy energy , money , and brisk good cheer , she spun past slack-jawed Southerners , fed the hungry , clothed the naked , paid the workers in her mills a living wage , the very lintheads her piratical Yankee father had despoiled and gotten rich on : a mystery . Another mystery : her sanctity and gluttony . She truly gave herself to others , served God and her fellow man with a good and cheerful heart  --  and ate and ate and ate , her eyes as round and glittering as a lover 's . It had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , she said , had the strength and deftness to lean into the Rolls , take her by the waist while she took him by the neck , and in one quick powerful motion swing her out and around and into the wheelchair . Yamaiuchi was strong enough to do it but she would n't let him . That 's why Yamaiuchi hates me , he thought . Had she promised him something in her will and had n't come through ? To the A &; P , then push her by one hand and the cart by the other while she snatched cans off the shelves , Celeste pizzas , Sara Lee cream pies , bottles of Plagniol , brownies , cream butter , eggs , gallons of custard ice cream . For her the pleasure came from the outing with him and from her " economizing " by doing her own shopping . Twice a week he took her also to St. Mark 's Home , where he wheeled her down the halls and she knew every resident by name and visited , wheelchair to wheelchair . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreshortened and her burly forearms , resting now , while he pushed . She ate more . She grew bigger , fatter , but also stronger . Shep158ate more and more : Smithfield hams , Yamaiuchi 's wife 's shirred eggs , Long Island ducks . Cholesterol sparkled like a golden rain in her blood , settled as a sludge winking with diamonds . A tiny stone lodged in her common bile duct . A bacillus sprouted in the stagnant dammed bile . She turned yellow as butter and hot as fire . There was no finding the diamond through the cliffs of ocherous fat . She died . Both Marion and Leslie his daughter were religious in ways which were both admirable and daunting . He could not disagreewith them nor allow himself the slightest distance of irony . How could he disagree with them ? Both seemed to be right or at least triumphantly well-intentioned . It was odd only that though he had no quarrel with them , they quarreled with each other . Marion had been an old-style Episcopalian who believed that one 's duty lay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , country , and doing good works . Leslie , his daughter , was a new-style Christian who believed in giving her life to the Lord through a personal encounter with Him and who accordingly had no use for church , priests , or ritual . She believed this and Jason believed a California version of this . They got along well together , did good works , and seemed to be happy . How could one find fault with Leslie ? Leslie was leaning forward , speaking slowly to Mr. Arnold . She was helping him with his speech . She was a speech therapist . When he tried to say something , his lips on the slack side blew out like a drape . Leslie grimaced impatiently . Now Leslie was arguing with Jack Curl , the minister . The three Cupps stood by silent and agreeable , tall as trees . The argument was not disagreeable , there were smiles and laughter , but it was an argument nevertheless . He could tell by the arch of Leslie 's back and by Jack Curl 's terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were probably arguing about the wedding . Marion had wanted a traditional ceremony . Leslie and Jason wanted to write their own ceremony . Marion had been a conservative Episcopalian and had no use for the changes in the church . Leslie and Jason were born-again Christians and had no usep159for anything , liturgy or sacrament , which got in the way of a personal encounter with Jesus Christ . Ed and Marge Cupp were Californians . Jack Curl , the minister , had no strong feelings about woman priests or the interim prayer book . He had been terrified that Marion , who had found him through her search committee and who considered the interim prayer book an abomination , would fire him . He attended ecumenical councils in the Middle East and Latin America . He had even visited a Russian bishop in Odessa and had started a collection of ikons . He wore jump suits . Kitty believed in astrology . Yamaiuchi was a Jehovah 's Witness . He believed he was one of the 144,000 who would survive Armageddon and actually live in their bodies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamaiuchi 's wife , the cook , was a theosophist , who believed in reincarnation . She believed she had once been a priestess on Atlantis before it sank . Is this an age of belief , he reflected , a great renaissance of faith after a period of crass materialism , atheism , agnosticism , liberalism , scientism ? Or is it an age of madness in which everyone believes everything ? Which ? The only unbelievers he knew in Linwood were Lewis Peckham and Ewell McBee , and they were even more dementedthan the believers . Leslie , who was sitting bolt upright on the couch , legs folded under her , took off her glasses to clean them , a habit she 'd always had , leaving her eyes naked and hazed . Looking at her , his daughter , he found himself thinking not about her or the wedding or the argument but , strangely enough , about how the girl in the woods might see her . In her nutty way with words , she would have seen Leslie in her name Leslie and now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Leslie , the two syllables of the name linked and hinged and folding just as her legs folded under her and the stems folded against her glasses , the whispering of her panty hose and the slight clash of the glasses connoted by the s in Les and the Leslie itself with its s and neuterness signifying both prissiness and masculinity ,  |p160a  secretarial primness which indeed Leslie had and which was all the more remarkable what with her being born-again . It was impossible to envision her personal encounter with Christ as other than a crisp business transaction . Yet once he saw her at the end of a prayer meeting when everyone smiled and cried and hugged each other . She had removed her thick glasses . It made her look naked and vulnerable . She smiled and hugged and cried too . It struck a strange pang to his very heart to see her like that . For some reason , tears sprang to his eyes too . What to make of all this melting belief ? Did he like her better cool and distant behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with opening up and ' loving everybody ? What was wrong with their loving Jesus ? I do n't know . Something . Marge Cupp cupped her hands and made swimming motions . An ex-Olympic swimmer , she was telling Jack Curl how she taught children to swim before they walked . Like many Californians , she knew how to expand the particular into the general , turn a hobby into a religion , and what 's more make it credible . It was easy to believe her and see her in the surf , a blond not-so-young Juno , waves foaming at her knees , her swim-coach tank suit well worn and dry , the hem slightly frayed over her strong dark marbled legs , launch happy babes into the Pacific , the Aquarians of a new age . Who knows ? Maybe she was right : going back where we came from , back to the primal sea . That was her California principle , leaving the sad failed land life behind and leaving it soon enough and young enough before it screwed you up for good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had the same salt content as blood and the amniotic fluid where we were happy ) , and , age ten months to ten years to a hundred , frolic like porpoises in the warm Cretaceous sea . Jack Curl was trying to listen but he was terrified . Jump suit or no jump suit , he was terrified . Would n't he have been better off rid of his genteel Virginia Episcopal tight-asked terror if Marge had got hold of him age six months and pitched him into the ocean ? Ed Cupp bunched the fingers of his left hand ( which was big enough to hold a basketball from the top ) and drove themp161up into his right . He was describing to Lewis Peckham the proper insertion of a Mercedes oil filter . There was a warranty problem with his car , whose engine had burnt up in Oklahoma City , where the Mercedes dealer had refused to honor the warranty , claiming that the oil filter had been inserted improperly . It was impossible to insert the filter improperly , said Ed Cupp , German engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about . He too was credible . Listening to him , one shared his outrage and wished him well in his lawsuit against the Oklahoma dealer . Leslie , leaning forward , smiling yet intense , was giving Mr. Arnold speech lessons , making a p by compressing her lips and puffing out the p against her hand , then holding her hand to Mr. Arnold 's mouth , but when he tried to say p , his slack lips blew out on the left side . Mr. Arnold looked around angrily and made motions toward his mouth . He was hungry . Leslie was angry with him . The tree was disappearing . There was a ripple in a glass windowpane . He knew that particular ripple . Sitting in a certainchair , not reading , not talking , not listening to music , he had discovered that the ripple lined up with the far rim of the gorge so that when he moved his head a wave seemed to run along the rocky ledge . Something was happening . Suddenly , with a little surge of satisfaction under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the look about it of coming to an end . There was nothing more he wished to say to the Cupps . There was nothing more for them to say to him . Things do come to an end . There was an end to this room . It was impossible for him to imagine entering this whited-out room tomorrow and lining up the ripple in the glass with the rim of the gorge . The tree was vanishing for good into the cloud . For at least a hundred times in past years he had lined up ripple of glass with rim of gorge . A novel thought occurred to him . Sooner or later there comes along a lining up which is the last  --  number IoI or 102 . Ordinarily one does not keep track and does not imagine that there will be a last lining up . But why not decide which lining up will be the last ? Very well . This one . He lined up ripple with the beginning of the gorgep162rim like the two points of a gunsight and moved his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scarlet oak which hid the target like the tree in front of the Texas Book Depository . Anyhow , the tree had almost vanished in the fog . Suddenly he knew why he remembered the triangular patch of woods near the railroad tracks where he wanted to make love to Ethel Rosenblum . It was the very sort of place , a nondescript weedy triangular public pubic sort of place , to make a sort of love or to die a sort of death . The silence of the cloud seemed to press in upon the house like cotton . Did you not then believe , old mole , that these two things alone are real , loving and dying , and since one is so much like the other and there is so little of the one , in the end there remained only the other ? Silence . Very well , old mole , you win . Kitty touched him , jostled him with her hip , shoulder , elbow . She looked at him . " You look as though you just made up your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just how to get it . " " Ah . " " What is it , Will ? " She moved closer . " All . " Her eyes widened . " Is it me ? " " Ah  --  " Kitty laughed , put her arm around his waist , and said she had a favor to ask of him . He smiled and nodded , noting with curiosity that everywhere she touched him a welt rose to meet her . His body swelled . It occurred to him that it would be pleasant to take her hand and hold it against him . He turned his back on the others . But before he could take her hand , she laid both hands on him and tugged him playfully roughly into the corner beyond Marion 's Louis XV secretary . As they went past , Kitty 's hand went out to touch one of the brilliantp163enamel-like decoupage panels . Hand and eye made one swift appraisal . " My God , would you look at that , " she said absently to no one and in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first and only love . Oh , it 's so good to see you . Do you remember Central Park ? " " Yes . " " What a dummy I was . I should have taken you up . But you were always so vague . I never knew when you were going to wander off in one of your funks . " " Taken me up on what ? " he said absently , watching the tree . The room was closed up in a cloud , a white room whited out by a white cloud , but no one seemed to notice . " Ha ha , haa haa . Do n't give me that , son , " said Kitty , comingeven closer . " All right . " Maybe he had " proposed " to her . In any case , he saw that Kitty had made over her past life in her head so that it became as clear and simple as a movie . He had proposed to her and she had turned him down . If she had taken him up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been happy . But she had n't and so her life had been screwed up . If only  --  But even an " if only " is not so bad if it is simple . Regret can be enjoyed if it makes sense . The difference between them was that the older she got the more sense her life made . Yet she was not altogetherserious in her swaying and swooping against him and her " if onlys . " The seriousness showed in her quick sure appraisalof the Louis XV secretary , the split-second touch-andlook . She knew what she wanted . What did she want from him ? The tree grew dimmer . Some of the leaves came off and blew straight up . There must be an updraft from the gorge . " What a good-looking couple we made , Will ! " " We did ? " " Do you remember what my housemother told me at school ? " " No . " " That you and I were not only the best-looking couple she had ever seen but the most distinguished . " Distinguished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bad but clear fiction and the always unclear fact . What could the housemother have meant ? What was distinguished about a coed cheerleader and an addled ATO who did n't know whether he was coming or going ? Ah , suddenly he saw what Kitty meant . She meant now they were a distinguished couple , he with his silvery temples , she with her lithe branny brown arms and gold swatch of hair . Kitty drew closer . " Stop giving me that Scorp look . It takes one to know one you know . " " What ? " " You have n't forgotten that we are both Scorps ? " " Scorps ? " " Scorpios . " She jostled him . " Do n't hand me that . " Perhaps he had not remembered everything . " Did you think I had forgotten your birthday ? It 's next month , the day after mine , remember ? Not that I needed to know . I could take one look at you , the way you stare right through people , and know you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . " " What ? " " Pluto , who governs both the positive and negative aspects of sex , is at this moment entering his own sign , which happens to be our own sign . " " Is that good ? " " Not good or bad as you damn well know . It all depends on the Scorps themselves . And I 'm here to tell you one thing about one Scorp . " " What ? " " I 'm no longer the little gray lizard Scorp you once knew . You 're looking at a fully evolved eagle Scorp , with the wellknownScorp sexuality and only us Scorps know what that means . " " I believe I am . " " And as for you  --  " " Yes ? " " Clearly you are somewhere in between , in transit . That 's fine as long as you do n't forget one thing . " " What ? " " What happens when two fully evolved Scorps get to-gether. "  | " What happens ? " " They can save a country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hepburn and Burt Lancaster are Scorps . " " That 's not  --  " Kitty 's face came into his neck . " Actually , that 's not why I grabbed you . " " Why did you grab me ? " " I wanted to tell you where I 'm coming from . " " Where are you coming from ? " " I 'm fixing to beat Marion 's time . And it 's perfectly all right with Marion . She gave me permission before she died . In fact , it was her idea . " " Beat Marion 's time , " he mused . " I have n't heard that for a long time . " He could n't seem to tear his eyes from the tree , which had all but vanished . He was trying to listen . Kitty was talking about what a good person Marion was , he was , she Kitty was . She was . He was . It was true . They were . Ah , what had happened to them all , all these good persons , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , home , family , country ? Why had he always felt glum when Marion spoke of these good things ? What had happened to marriage ? Why was not goodness enough for marriage ? Why did good married couples look so glum ? Old couples , young couples , thirty-five-year-old Atlanta couples in condos , sixty-five-year-old Ohio couples in villas , each as glum as if one had got stuck with the other at a cocktail party for two hours . Two hours ? Ten years ! Thirty years ! " What ? " he said and gave a start . Kitty seemed to be talking about her daughter . " Schizophrenics often are . " " Are what ? " " Shrewd . Walter wanted to call the cops when she escapedbut Alistair said that Allison is very shrewd in her own way  --  it 's true !  --  and that she 'll probably come back to Valleyhead . " " Then you do n't know where she is , " he said absently . Nowhe knew why the girl in the woods looked familiar . She hadthe same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling the lip into a bow and just clear of the lower . Thep166first time he had seen Kitty on a park bench , lips parted so , he had wanted her mouth . " Actually , I think I do . She has some hippie friends in VirginiaBeach . Yes , I 'm sure that 's where she is . Actually I think it might do her good . She 's no dumbbell . She planned the whole thing , swiped four hundred dollars from her father , and disappeared into thin air . I 'm going to give her a few days and then go find her . That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Do you mind having your old flame in your hair for a few days ? " " All no . " There were three shells on the quilt of the Negro cabin where he was lying . The Negro boy had brought them , and even the one dead quail , and put them on the bed beside him . Some guide . What guide would retrieve empty shotgun shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the clean damp rag . " You ai n't hurt bad . You just lay there until the high sheriff comes . " The room smelled of kerosene and flour paste . Fresh newspapers covered the walls . She leaned over him . The movement of the rag against his cheek and lip was quick and firm but did not hurt . " Your daddy be all right . Ai n't nothing wrong the good Lord cai n't fix , " the woman said . He turned away impatiently . " Where 's the shotgun ? " The Greener lay on the other side of him . The guide had found it and brought it back . He broke the breech . There was a single shell in the right barrel . Yet only now , thirty years later , did he do the arithmetic . One shell for the quail , two for me , and one for you . Well well , he thought , shaking his head and feeling in his pockets for the Mercedes keys . He must have been smiling because Kitty gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you nut ? " To his surprise  --  yes ! now he could he surprised !  --  a strange gaiety took hold of him . Something rose in his throat . What ? Laughter . He laughed out loud . " What are you laughing at , idiot ? " " Everything . Nothing . I 'm sorry . What were you saving about ah  --  "  | " Allison . " " Allison ? " " My daughter , dummy . Allie . " Allie . Yes . That was her name . That was Allie sitting on the stoop of the greenhouse reading the fat pulpy Captain Blood . Allie . " I want you to meet her , talk to her , listen to her . I want her to get to know you . She ca n't talk to people but somehow I know that she would talk to you . I ca n't tell you how many times the thought has come to me that if only you had been there all along Allison would have been all right . And here 's the strangest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be or ought to be her father  --  ha ! fat chance , yet there is a slight chance , remember ? " " Remember what ? " Had he forgotten something or had Kitty rewritten the entire book of her life ? His eyes went unfocused on the white cloud . " No , really , Will . There is something about her , about us , about Allison . We were together once in another life . " " What ? " He gave a violent start . " I said  --  What are you smiling about , you nut ? " " Was I smiling ? " " Like a chess cat . " " A what ? " " Like somebody had let you in on a big secret . " " A secret . Yes . " He looked at Kitty . In the corner of his eye he could see Leslie talking to the Cupps . She was nodding and frowning . They were arguing , he knew , about the after-rehearsal party . It was the custom for the groom 's family to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buccaneer Tavern at the Holiday Inn . Leslie looked sullen . Kitty 's hand , he noticed , was on his arm . He gave a start . He had not been listening . " Do n't forget , " whispered Kitty in his ear but not quite managing to whisper . " What ? " " Three o'clock . "  | " Okay , " he said absently . " Is n't it a shame that we waste so much time figuring out what we want , " said Kitty . " To think of the years  --  " " Right . " Marion had wanted to serve God , eat , and to do good . Jimmy Rogers and the dentist wanted money . Kitty wanted what ? him ? his money ? out from the dentist ? He wanted what ? Kitty 's ass ? Death ? Both ? Kitty 's face had gone solemn . Her eyes were shining . " You will help me with Allison ? " " Sure , " he said absently . " The child has n't learned that she has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . When things do n't go just right , she thinks she has to crawl into a hole . Or hit the road , change , move , go . " " Yes , " he muttered . " Sometimes you have to go . Get out . I 've done that . " " You ? You 've never copped out . You were a good husband . Marion told me . " " Actually I was n't . Did she tell you what I did last year ? " " No . " " One Sunday after church Marion sent me to town for some booze . We were entertaining Bertie and some of his Palm Beach pals . It was not that I could n't stand Bertie and his pals , though in fact I could n't . In fact , I do n't know exactly why I did it . Instead , of going to the liquor store I went to the bus station and took the first Trailways . A week later I found myself in Santa Fe . You know who I was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " What was he doing ? " " He was sitting in an imitation adobe house watching M*A*S*H . He would only talk to me during commercials . He was working in a V.A . hospital for paraplegics and had one more year to go before his pension . After a while I left . I do n't think he noticed . " " Sutter is a mess , " said Kitty absently and took hold of him , coat , shirt , flank , and gave him a hard pinch as a mother might . " Do n't forget , " she said . " Three o'clock . The summerhouse . " " What ? Oh . No . I wo n't forget . "  |p169Leslie  looked up at him briefly and went on with her argument with the Cupps . No , it was Leslie and Jack Curl who were arguing . Or rather Jack Curl who was listening , pale as a ghost , as Leslie said : " Okay , big deal . First you have the Book of Common Prayer , then the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zebra book , then the interim book  --  and that was all I ever heard you and Mother talk about . Big deal . " As he watched Jack Curl , who was smiling and frowning and had opened his mouth to say something , he heard himself say : " Am I not also a member of the wedding ? " No one paid attention . Leslie 's face was heavy with dislike , her lower lip curled . The Cupps were still smiling but their teeth looked dry . Mr. Arnold pointed his finger at his open mouth . He was hungry . Jason sat listlessly , big hands dangling between his legs . They were all angrier than he thought . Were they arguing about religion or the rehearsal party ? " Very well , " said Will Barrett , clearing his throat . " It seems I am not a member of the wedding . " When no one answered or looked at him , he cleared his throat again . " Okay . I have one suggestion before I leave "  --  when he said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " to go on an errand . It is this . It is my understanding that according to custom and the book of etiquette we are not supposed to have the rehearsal party here in this house , though as Marge and Ed well know , it would please me to do so . If Ed and Marge wish to give the party at the Buccaneer Room of the Holiday Inn , it is quite all right with me . After all , one place is as good as another . If , however , there is some dissatisfaction on this point , may I suggest as a tertium quid , ha ha , that if Ed wishes me to , I can put him in touch with Arthur at the club and the two of them can work out what they want . It is done all the time and it will cost Ed so much it will take his mind off his Mercedes . " " There you go , " said Ed , cheering up . Leslie held up both hands . " Now hear this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folding the stems . Her hazed eyesp170went from one to another . She nodded grimly . Her thin lips curved in satisfaction . She looked like Barbara Stanwyck in that part of the movie where she tells everybody off . " Numberone , there is not going to be a rehearsal party for the simple reason that there is not going to be a rehearsal . The reason there is not going to be a rehearsal is that there is not going to be any ceremony to be rehearsed . Since when do you need a ceremony for two people to come together in the Lord ? Number two . As for this book I keep hearing about , the only book I go by is the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . Number three . The only reason Jason and I are here at all is because you want us to be . We love you all dearly and wish to please you but we can not compromise our beliefs . Number four . As far as such quaint customs as giving the bride away ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean to hurt your feelings , Daddy , but nobody can give me away because I 've already given myself away , to the Lord and to Jason . Number five . As far as a priest is concerned , an intermediary between God and man , no hard feelings , Jack , but the Gospel commands us to call no man father . " Jack Curl opened his hands to everyone . " Father ? Nobody calls me father . Who here calls me father ? " But no one answered . Everyone seemed sunk in thought . Only Mr. Arnold tried to say something but his lips blew out . He pointed a finger straight into his mouth . Across the room Yamaiuchi was leaving fast with a tray of empty bloody-Mary glasses . Will Barrett called to him and made a motion . It was possible for Yamaiuchi , whose eye had not quite met his , to pretend he had n't heard him . He called to him again . He knew that Yamaiuchi heard because his ears flattened even closer to his glossy head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone but Marion , who had hired him and sent him to forestryschool in Asheville , to give him orders . For this reason it now became possible for Yamaiuchi to pretend not to hear him . For some reason this made him angry with a quick hot anger . He lost his temper . He had not been angry or surprised for thirty years  --  no , once before , when Kitty 's brother was dying and the stupid nurses would n't do anything  --  and in thep171very instant of feeling the anger rise in his throat , he remembered that it was with exactly the same sudden rage his father had turned on the black guide . His father , known as a niggerlover , cursed the guide like a nigger-hater . He , Will Barrett , meant to say : Get your ass or perhaps even get your yellow ass ( his father said black ass ) over here , but he felt the room go silent and felt himself shrug and laugh as Yamaiuchi wheeled with the tray . He beckoned to him . Yet even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided she was n't boss , and came over , smiling angrily . " Bring this man a plate of food , " he said , pointing to Mr. Arnold , who was pointing a forefinger straight into his mouth . " Y'sah , " said Yamaiuchi . " The buffet is urready . " Again his eye slewed toward Leslie . Was he saying , I 'd rather take orders from her ? " Do it now , " he said , smiling angrily . He was genuinely puzzled : I wonder why this Japanese is playing this game , calculating decimal points of insolence . " Y'sah . " Yamaiuchi bowed , two degrees too far , and left . Someday I 'm going to hit that little grinning bastard , he thought , drive him right into the ground with both fists . An instant later he thought with amazement , where did that rage come from ? I could have killed him . My father could have too : he could as easily have shot the guide as he shot the dog . You 're one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm one of you . You win . Where does such rage come from ? from the discovery that in the end the world yields only to violence , that only the violent bear it away , that short of violence all is in the end impotence ? He gazed at himself in the bathroom mirror , turned his head , touched his cheek like a man testing whether to shave . Presentlyhis face canceled itself . The bright-faceted foreheadp172went dark , the deep-set eyes began to glow , the shadowed pocked cheek grew bright . The mirror , he noticed , did not reflect accurately . It missed the slight bulge of forehead , the hollowing of temple which showed in photographs . Even when he turned his head , his nose did not look snoutish as it did in a double mirror . Something stirred in him . He looked at his watch . In three minutes Kitty would slip out into the cloud . When he thought of her standing in the summerhouse , hugging herself , wrapped in fog , he smiled . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thighs broadening and filling the creamy linen skirt . Yes , it was in her , not in a mirror , he would find himself . Entering her , he would be answered , responded to , delineated . His life would be proved by her . She would echo him , print him out , trace his shape like radar . He could read himself in her . His heart gave a big pump . Did Kitty want what she appeared to want ? Did she want him to fuck her in the summerhouse ? Yes ! And it was Kitty 's ass he wanted . Yes ! He blinked in astonishment . It was as if he had forgotten about women , about loving women , about having a woman 's ass or loving a woman , one woman , one 's own heart 's love , love her heart , mind , soul , sweet lips , ass and all . A violent shiver took hold of him ; hairs on his arm raised . What was he afraid of ? of being caught ? that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck , he hurried down the back stairs to the garage  --  and fell . Either fainted or fell , or slipped and fell , and knocked himself out , or perhaps had a fit , one of his " petty-mall " spells . Fit or fall , it seemed to him that he drifted down weightlessly , careening softly off the walls of the stairwell , and fetched up comfortably at the bottom of the steps . If he had been knocked out , he must have come to instantly , in decent time to collect himself , not get up but arrange himself in a sitting-lying position on the bottom step . There was a sound . Someone had entered the garage . The narrow stairwell was dark . The bright cloud seemed to fill the garage . He could see the three cars and most of the floor without being seen . Methodically he felt his arms and legs and clenched his fists.  |p173Had  he had a stroke ? Would he have to carry one fisted hand in the other like a baby ? No , his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one eye . He touched his cheek . It was blood . Above , at his temple , rose a clotted swelling . Though it seemed to be growing larger , it did n't hurt . The cat sat in its usual place under the Rolls . Tendrils of fog drifted across the clean floor . The light from the cloud struck the concrete at such an angle that he could make out the faint arcs of the mason 's trowel . The fog crept under the Mercedes , where it vaporized and disappeared . Perhaps there was a faint warmth in the motor . He noted with curiosity that there seemed to be no hurry , that there was all the time in the world , time to take account of small events in the garage . More important , it had become possible to take stock of himself , assess the extent of his injuries , and make his plans accordingly . Curious ! Suddenly he had come into himself like the cat , got rid of the ghost which stood aside from himself , forever rushing ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of cats and concrete ! He smiled . Perhaps something had been knocked loose in his head . Or perhaps something loose had been knocked together . Someone had come from behind the Rolls and was standing over him . Leaning on one elbow , he cocked his head to look up . " Lawyer Barrett ? " " Yes ? " It was Ewell McBee . " Lawyer Barrett , I needed to tell you something . " " You already told me . You apologized for the shot . Do n't worry about it , " he said dreamily . Ewell loomed against the white cloud . As he shaded his eyes with one hand to see him better , he noticed that Ewell 's head silhouetted against the whiteness showed a slight hollowing at the temple oddly like his own . And when he turned his head , there was a familiar snoutishnessabout the nose . " I needed to ask you something . " Ewell did not seem to find it remarkable that he was loungingin the dark stairwell . In his strange new mood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ghost-ridden as they are by themselves . You have to be bleeding from the mouth or throwing a fit for them to take notice . Otherwise , anything you do is no more or less than another part of the world they have to deal with , poor souls . You worry about what you are supposed to do . The funny thing is , no matter what you do , people believe it is no more or less than what you are supposed to do . " I 'm going to make you a proposition you ca n't turn down , haw haw , " said Ewell . He hawked , spat , hiked a foot up on the Mercedes bumper , settled his crotch . " Your video-cassette company ? How much do you want me to invest ? " He seemed to understand everything Ewell said before he said it . He tried to stand but something was wrong with his left leg ; it gave way . It was possible to resume his lounging position in such a casual way that Ewell did not seem to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my potner , " said Ewell , placing one hand softly on the Mercedes hood . " We going to have us a little party tonight . At my villa . A private screeningof her latest film . It 's called Foxy Frolics and it 's a winner , I guarantee . Just me and my potner and you and her leading lady . She 's actually a wonderful girl named Cheryl Lee from Chapel Hill and she 's as smart as she can be . What she really wants to do is play the violin for the Appalachian symphony . She 's into erotic movies for the money . What she really is is a musician . What talent ! The party is her idea . She wants to meet you . For some reason she thinks you 're the smartest and sexiest man she ever saw . I told her you were as dumb as me , just richer , har har . " A rushing black tide seemed to be filling one end of the garage . When he closed one eye , then the other , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head a little to confront it , the wall of darkness retreated . Ewell hawked . " We can have us a party . First I make us some toddies like your daddy used to make , then Norma Jean will cook us a steak , then we 'll show the film and I promise you you 'll have the finest time you ever had . Cheryl is a littlep175armful of heaven , but she is also smart . You and me understand each other , do n't we ? " He cocked his head , the better to see the looming figure of Ewell McBee , the slightly hollow temple , the snoutish nose . It seemed strange to hear Ewell , who once was a bully and jerkoffartist who wore bib overalls and had thick white countrywhiteskin talking about " films " and " screening " and being " into " this and that . But he was only half listening . He tested the strength of his hands , moved his legs . I believe I can walk after Ewell leaves . The rushing darkness had fallen back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered . It did not seem to matter . The newfoundcore of calmness and freedom seemed safe from such things , even from the tide of darkness trembling at the corner of his eye . Unhurriedly he began to listen to Ewell , who was talking about his , Will Barrett 's , father . " He was the smartest man I ever knew and he would bet on anything . He would bet you five dollars a mocking bird would sit still while he hit a niblick out of the sand . " Yeah , that 's real smart . " He would always give me ten dollars after a round  --  that was a lot then . Once I was caddying for him and Judge Pettigrewand Senator Talley and an insurance man and I heard him buy a one-million-dollar life-insurance policy , just like that . " That was real smart too . Buy a million-dollar life-insurance policy , then scatter your brain cells over the state of Mississippi . " I never will forget one thing he told a preacher . One time they had a preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could tell he was getting on your daddy 's nerves . He could n't cuss . The preacher kept talking about his church , how much money he took in , and saving souls , ten thousand souls in this one church in Charlotte . Oh the soul this and the soul that , praise the Lord and so forth . Your daddy did n't say a word . But he was getting hot under the collar . Then he said something to the preacher I will never forget . You know what he said ? " Ewell hawked and hiked himself.  | " No . " " He said to him right in the middle of number-six fairway . He said let me tell you something about all those souls you 're bragging about . In the first place , you want to know what a soul is ? I 'll tell you . A soul is a man like you and me and Ewell here . You want to know what a man is ? I 'll tell you . A man is born between an asshole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fucks , works , gets old , and dies . And that 's all he does . That 's what a man is . That 's what he said . I 'm telling you , your daddy was a pistol-ball . " " Yes . " That 's what he was , a pistol-ball . " Well , we going to have our little party ? " " Party ? " he said absently . " If you do n't , Lawyer Barrett , you 'll be making the mistake of your life . Here is this beautiful talented girl who has the hots for you , and you may not have another chance because I guarantee you she 's on her way up . Just you remember her name , Cheryl Lee . That 's her stage name . Her real name is Sarah Goodman from Wilmington and she 's going to be famous . " " Will she be famous for Foxy Frolics or for her violin playing ? " He pricked up his ears . " Did you say Sarah Goodman ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . " " Are you sure ? " " Sure I 'm sure . Her old man is Sol Goodman in dry-goods . " " Did you say she was from Wilmington ? " " Yes , but  --  " " Wilmington , North Carolina ? " " Why yes . Do you know her ? " " And you say she 's leaving ? She 's going back to Israel , right ? " " Israel ? Why no . If she passes her audition , she 's moving to Asheville . If not , she 'll come back to Highlands and make movies with Norma Jean . I think she ought to do that anyhow . She 's a real fine little actress . " " I see . " He brightened . " Are you sure she 's Jewish ? I mean , after all you ca n't go by a name . Rosenberg was a Nazi . "  | " Is the Pope Catholic ? I 'm telling you , I know her old man , Sol Goodman . " " I see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . Do you know who she looks exactly like ? Remember Linda Darnell ? Imagine a Linda Darnell who can play the violin like Evelyn and Phil Spitalny . In fact , now that she 's finished this film , she 's getting ready for her first recital . " He must have had a lapse of inattention or perhaps even another spell . Did he blank out ? How much time passed ? In any case , he must have seemed rude because the next thing he knew , Ewell McBee was standing directly over him , feet apart , hands on his hips , speaking loudly . He seemed to be in a rage . " You want to know what your trouble is , Lawyer Barrett ? " " Why , yes , " he said with genuine curiosity , cocking his head to look up . " The trouble with you is you always thought you were too good for anybody or anything . Nothing is ever good enough for you . " " Really ? " he said , peering up at Ewell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought you were so damn smart . You and your daddy . But I 'm here to tell you something . The only difference between you and me is money . Outside of that , you and I are exactly alike . You and your daddy are smart all right but there is such a thing as outsmarting yourself . You even think you 're smarter than your daddy , do n't you ? " " Is that right ? " Well , yes . He gazed up at Ewell with curiosity . Enemies , he knew , often tell the truth . And these days enemies , honest enemies , are few and far between . Nobody says anything unpleasant . Enemies will often tell you unsuspected truths about yourself , just as a photograph or a double mirror will show your snoutishnose . " You know I 'm right , Lawyer Barrett . " " About what ? " " About us being exactly alike . " " How is that ? " " You know as well as I do we could have us a fine timep178having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film and having some drinks and later having a real party . I mean a fine time . A little pussy never hurt anybody . You like pussy as much as I do , do n't you ? " " I had n't thought about it lately , " he said , but thinking now of Kitty 's ass . Well , yes . How could it have slipped my mind ? What time is it ? " But you do n't talk about it because you think you 're too good to have a party with me . " " A party with Sarah Goodman is not out of the question . " But Ewell 's anger carried him beyond listening . In a way , he 's taking another shot at me , he saw . " Me and you are alike as two peas in a pod , " said Ewell , moving his shoulders . " The only difference between us is that me and my daddy had to work like niggers and you and your daddy had your own niggers and enough money to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . " " How are we the same ? " he asked curiously , straining up to see and hear . " Your daddy said it . What 's more , we both love money , only you were smarter about getting it and so you do n't have to talk about it . You marry the richest lady in the state , so you do n't have to worry about it . Then you can go around giving it away , so you can be man-of-the-year . Like money do n't matter to you . You 're right . It do n't matter if you got it . But if you did n't have it , it would matter . You act like you was so sorry your wife passed . Maybe you was . She was a real fine lady . But maybe it did n't exactly kill your soul that you inheritedall that money . But you would never say . The only difference between us is that I would say . I married the meanestdamn white woman in Henderson County and I was glad she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're smart . And you 're ever bit as cold-blooded as I am , only you do n't have to talk about it because you got money . Money may not be everything but it sho lets you act nice . My daddy used to tell me : make the money then act as nice as you please . You 're even smarter than your daddy . Look what happened to him . But not you . You setting there right this minute eyeing me and listening and figuring something out , ai n't you ? "  | " What do you think I 'm figuring out , Ewell ? " " I do n't know because you do n't say . You never did . But you 're figuring hard as you can . And you setting there acting polite and you ai n't about to come to my house for a party . " " As a matter of fact , I would like to meet Sarah Goodman , that is , Cheryl Lee . " Kitty told him he had been Jewish in another life . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina Jewish girl was still here ? that she had not only not returned to Israel but was hanging around Highlands making erotic movies and having parties in villas with Gentiles , Jutes like Ewell ? If so , what did that signify ? And why did he want to see her ? to have her ass or to find out if she was going to Israel ? Ewell , he saw , had reached that degree of anger where everything is received as a provocation . On he came , shouldering . The only thing that prevented a fistfight was that he , Will Barrett , was lounging at his ease on the steps , sitting-lying , propped on one elbow , head cocked , eyeing him . A strange thought occurred to him . Perhaps Ewell was the last hater . Has a time come when not only has love left the world but hatred also and nothing is left but niceness ? Ewell went on talking but with a slackening of anger , with even a hint of affection , perhaps the sort of affection which follows barroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making plans for the party . " Do n't worry about a thing . You and me going to have us a fine time . " The white cloud which filled the wide doorway had grown as dense and solid as a pearl . No doubt the sun shone directly upon it , for it was shot through with delicate colors . Again the ripple of darkness came forward at the corner of his eye but it went away when he tried to look at it . Instead , he looked at the three cars . The three , one English , one German , one Japanese , seemed as beautiful as birds poised for flight at any moment from the immaculate concrete . Perhaps I am having some sort of an attack , he thought with interest , a stroke , hemorrhage , tumor , epilepsy . But if something is wrong with me , how is it that I can see so clearly and calmly , that I do not cast forward or backward fromp180myself , am here in the here-and-now , and know what I any going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one of his spells , for when he looked up , Ewell McBee had vanished without a trace . Swallowed up by the thick opalescent cloud . So here he was , the engineer , as Will Barrett used to think of himself in the early days when he wandered around in a funk in New York trying to " engineer " his own life , now years later , after a fairly normal life , a fairly happy marriage , a successful career , and a triumphant early retirement to enjoy the good things of life . Here he was , more funked out and nuttier than ever , having experienced another of his " spells " as they used to be called in his childhood , which were undoubtedly a form of epilepsy to say the least and perhaps a disorder a good deal more serious . Here he was , pacing up and down his room , sunk in thought , smiling from time to time , and once snapping his fingers softly like a man who has suddenly hit upon the solution to a difficult problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So intent was he in planning his new " experiment " that he had forgotten about lunch , about his daughter 's impending wedding , about his guests downstairs and , for the moment at least , about his tryst with Kitty in the summerhouse . ( Yet why did he look at his watch ? ) The plan of action he had hatched would surely have seemed lunatic and laughable to the good folk of Linwood , or to any sensible person for that matter , if it were not fraught with dangerous , even fatal consequences . Though he had given up his peculiar preoccupation with the Jews  --  the Jews , it seemed , had not left North Carolina  --  he had conceived an even more outlandish scheme and now was making plans for putting it into action . It is one thing to labor under the delusionthat all Jews had left North Carolina . It is something else to embark upon an adventure which would surely endanger his life . What a shame he could not have relaxed and enjoyed lifep181like his friends and neighbors in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people they were by and large , business and professional men like himself who had worked hard , made money , raised families , been good citizens , and now were able to enjoy summer places or retire into condos and villas and savor the fruits of their labors . They walked in the woods ablaze with fall colors , played golf on a famous and sportive old links , went shopping for quilts or jellies or antiques , or simply sat about their patios having a sociable drink or two against a backdrop of Sourwood Mountain , gorges , and the faint blue hulk of the Great Smokies . What a shame , considering his wealth and talents and generallikableness , that he could not have enjoyed his life rather than raging at it , that he could not have gone on with his many charitable works as he had when his wife was alive . Or , if he had no use for the company of ordinary retirees , there were more cultivated people available , classical-musiclovers , book readers , folk-music-lovers , serious bird-watchers , and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Symphony , or discussing Erich Fromm with Lewis Peckham , and why did the prospect of spending time doing so make him groan aloud ? No doubt Lewis Peckham and the doctors were right . Such negative feelings could only be symptomatic of a physical or nervous disorder . No , instead of savoring the ordinary pleasures of leisure or gleaning the rewards of philanthropy or enjoying intellectual companionship , he must concoct one of the strangest schemes ever hit upon by the mind of man . He was right about one thing : it is doubtful if anyone had ever thought of it before . And yet his " experiment " seemed to him the very model of logic , elegance , and simplicity . Such was his state of mind . Ewell McBee , though an ornery unlettered covite despite his Jaymar Sansabelt slacks , a mountain man meaner than most , was right about one thing , he said to himself , pacing back and forth , setting fist softly into hand . He , Will Barrett , had learned over the years that if you listen carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially from the unlikeliestsources , from an enemy , from a stranger , from children , from nuts , from overheard conversations , from stupidp182preachers ( certainly not from eloquent preachers ! ) . When he used to go to church with Marion , he discovered that if you listen carefully to a dumb preacher , he will almost invariably and despite himself say something of value . " As anyone can plainly see , " said one dullard called in from Asheville by Jack Curl to pinch-hit , " all the signs of Armageddonare present . " And in a droning voice he listed them , including the return of the Jews to Israel . On a beautiful Sunday morning in the mountains of North Carolina no one in the congregation paid the slightest attention  --  except Will Barrett , who , head slightly cocked to favor his good ear , had listened to every word  --  just as he had listened to Ewell McBee . Are not great discoveries also made at the unlikeliest moments , such as listening to a droning preacher ? His discovery had been made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on and on about their childhood , about my daddy and your daddy , how much alike we are , and so forth . Ewell had given him the clue when he said how " smart " he , Will Barrett , was , smarter even than his daddy . " You do n't say nothing , Will , you just lay back like you doing now , listening and thinking , like you going to make some great discovery . " What was the Great Discovery ? We may as well say it right out . It dawned on him that his father 's suicide was wasted . It availed nothing , proved nothing , solved nothing , posed no questions let alone answered questions , did nobody good . It was no more than an exit , a getting up and a going out , a closing of a door . Most of all , it offended Will Barrett 's sense of economy and proportion , of thrift , that so much , a life no less , could be spent with so little return . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well put it to dire practical use . In his Trusts and Estates law practice , he had learned that one often does well to attach huge conditions to huge bequests . I will not waste mine , he thought , smiling . Redneck Ewell was right , was n't he ? It was his , Will Barrett 's , own sly way of " being smart , " that is , of standing aside and keeping quiet , looking on , observing commonplace disasterwhich everyone else accepts as a matter of course , thenp183figuring something out which converts a necessary evil to an ingenious good . " You remind me of the fellow in charge of a garbage dump who discovered he could run his car on garbage , " Ewell told him . " That way you do two things , get rid of the garbage and beat the Ayrabs  --  you like killing two birds with one stone , do n't you ? " Yes . Again snapping his fingers softly , he sat down at his desk , a fine colonial pine piece his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled again . It was a pleasure to sit at a proper desk , take out stationery and pen , hatch out a plan , and write the necessary documents to bring it to pass . The " documents " were two letters , one to Lewis Peckham , the other to Dr. Sutter Vaught . Dear Lewis : This letter is a mple precaution . When you receive it , you can desrioy it without reading further , for I intend in fact t see you today before you receive this letter tomorrow . I take the precaution upon your own advice . In our spelunking days you told me never to enter a cave alone without telling someone where I was going . In a word I am accepting your invitation to visit you this afternoon and I shall walk down to your farmhouse via Lost Cove cave , entering by the upper Confederate " escape hole " you showed me when I sliced out-ofboundsand exiting at the main entrance near your house in the valley below . Though I am not familiar with the upper reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , down , and I remember the lower part , the " commercial " cave , very well . For one thing , I have a sudden hankering to visit the haunt of the saber-tooth tyger you discovered . Mentioning the " tyger " lair is an essential part of the plan , he thought with a smile . First , it would tickle Lewis 's literary fancy . Tyger Tyger and Lewis would have them off in ap184Blakean exploration of mythic depths . Second , and more important , it would establish a destination , a place in the vast , still not wholly explored , cavern . The prospect of bourbon and Beethoven is irresistible . This was the only lie in the letter . The prospect of having a tad of bourbon and branch water , as Lewis would say , and listening to Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony was not only not irresistible , it was horrendous . The mere thought of it was enough to make him grimace and shiver like a bird dog with the squats . If I have n't turned up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cask of Wild Turkey . Take care , WillHe addressed the envelope , licked the flap , sealed it , stamped it , felt and admired the heavy creamy embossed stationery , which Marion had given him and which he had never used . Why was it no longer possible to sit at a desk and write a proper letter like a character in an old-fashioned novel who.as a matter of course might write any number of such letters to friends , members of family ? If his daughter should receive such a letter from him , or he from her , each would faint . It is only possible to write a letter now , he reflected , if it is part of a larger plan which could settle things once and for all , for himself , his daughter  --  and everyone else , for that matter . The second letter was addressed , on a larger envelope , to Dr. Sutter Vaught , 2203 Los Flores Boulevard , Albuquerque , New Mexico . Dear Sutter : I have a favor to ask of you . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I would trust to do it . Another reason is that the nature of the favor is such that , though somewhatburdensome , I am confident you will grant it . Knowing you perhaps better than you think , I have reason to believe that aside from the urgency of my ap/peal it is the very strangeness of my request which will insure its being carried out . You told me once that nowadays no one knew anything with sufficient certitude that he could tell anyone anything , and that if a man ever came along who really knew and could speak with authority  --  do this , do that  --  millions would follow him . I tell you , not millions , to do this one thing for me . I do not ask you , I tell you : do this . I am enclosing a stamped sealed envelope addressed to one Lewis Peckham of Linwood , North Carolina . Do this . After you receive this letter , wait three weeks . If by this time you have not heard to the contrary from me , proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to the post office , fold and soil the letter to Lewis Peckham , and drop it in the mail slot marked " local . " It will be assumed by the addressee that the letter was mislaid by a postal employee , dropped behind a radiator , kicked under a table , belatedly discovered , sneaked into the " local " bin by the guilty clerk , and so belatedly postmarked . It will be assumed by the postal authorities , should it come to this , that the letter was dropped inadvertentlyoutside the post office , discovered , and mailed by some helpful soul . After you do this , leave town immediately and say nothing of this to anyone . Be assured that you are not being asked to become a party to a fraud or worse crime . This is a good deal of trouble , I realize , to get from Albuquerque to Linwood , North Carolina , without a car , since you did not replace your Edsel , but I am confident that you will do it . Please believe me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , that you destroy this letter and that you never speak of this matter again . Of course it may come to pass that you will hear from me before the deadline , in which case your mission is to he abandoned . In this event , I shall explain further . Perhaps I owe you some explanation of this unusualp186request . I shall give you a partial one , at the risk of offendingand alarming you . But at least you will see that no harm can come to anyone but me , and possibly not even to me , but that there is nothing you can do to prevent it in any case  --  and that a great good may come to many people . If you do not hear from me in three weeks I shall be dead by the time Lewis Peckham receives the letter you will mail in Linwood . There is nothing you can do to prevent this . In fact , the only chance of preventing it will depend upon your carrying out these instructions to the letter . If you will recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of the delayed mailing is to make sure that my body will be found and found under such circumstancesas to preclude suicide and the nonpayment of my life insurance . Fraud is not involved  --  though a case for it would undoubtedly be made by the insurance company , since a payment of one million is involved . Under the law , life insurance must be paid in the event of death by natural causes , accidents , or acts of God . My death , if it occurs , shall occur not by my own hand but by the hand of God . Or rather the handlessness or inaction of God . If I die , it will not be by my own hand but through the dereliction of another . It is not my intention to die but to live . Therefore , should I die , it will not be suicide . This is what you might call the ultimate scientific experimentin contrast to dreary age-old philosophical and religious disputations which have no resolution . I say " ultimate " because God is the subject under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and for all . The Prudential Life Insurance Company quite properly did not pay me , the beneficiary of my father 's policy , since he died by his own hand . I freely acknowledge this , even though I was sole beneficiary and could have used the money . Nevertheless I feel euchred out of that million . He paid for it and I could have used it . Without it , his death made no sense.  |p187But  in my case , if I die , it will be God or the absence of God which is responsible . Neither God nor the absence of God are listed as causes of death in my Prudential policy . Nor are they listed as the causes of suicide . Thereforethe policy must be paid to my beneficiary , and my claim is not fraudulent . The Rock will pay because the law requires it . The purpose of my request to you is to insure that the law not be circumvented . It is not in your interest to know what I plan to do . Suffice it to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I know , what I do n't know , what needs to be done , and what I shall do . If you remember , it was your constant complaint that I was forever looking to you for " all the answers . " However much you find yourself inconveniencedby this request , it should at least please you to know that I have at last understood you . One must arrive at one 's own answers . I may not know the answer , but I know the question . And I know how to put the question so that it must be answered . So certain am I of my own course of action that I do not require your approval . What I require from you is that you do what I say , and I charge you to do so on the pain of having my death on your conscience . I will say only that the action I propose to take comes as a consequence of my belated recognition of my lifelong dependency on this or that person , like my father or yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on this or that book or theory like Dr. Freud 's ( which I thought might hold the Great Secret of Life , as if there were such a thing ) . My equally belated discovery is the total failure , fecklessness , and assholedness of people in general and in particular just those people I had looked to . This includes you . Maybe you most of all  --  for it was you , it seemed to me  --  if you recall , I had good detection devices , excellent radar for knowing who knew what  --  it was you of all the pleasant prosperous gregarious denizensof our dear old Southland ( to say nothing of thep188even more fucked-up remainder of the U.S.A. ) who seemed to be on to something . My father seemed to know what was what and ended up distributing his brain cells over the attic  --  after trying to take me with him . Perhaps he was right . I aim to find out . I have found out how to find out . You seemed to know what was what and you end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching M*A*S*H . Toward what end ? So you can retire on your pension and watch the soaps all day ? Quite properly , you refused to give me any answers . Perhaps you did n't have any . It does n't matter now . But I have a question and a way of asking it which requires an answer . A non-answer is not possible . But this does not concern you . So much for you . My quarrel with the others can be summed up as a growing disgust with two classes of people . These two classes between them exhaust the class of people in general . That is to say , there are only two classes of people , the believers and the unbelievers . The only difficulty is deciding which is the more feckless . My belated discovery of the bankruptcy of both classes has made it possible for me to take action . Better late than never . Take Christians . I am surrounded by Christians . They are generally speaking a pleasant and agreeable lot , not noticeably different from other people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S.A. , the Western world have killed off more people in recent centuries than all other people put together . Yet I can not be sure they do n't have the truth . But if they have the truth , why is it the case that they are repellent precisely to the degree that they embrace and advertise that truth ? One might even become a Christian if there were few if any Christians around . Have you ever lived in the midst of fifteen million Southern Baptists ? ( Of course you have . You 're from Alabama . ) No doubt the same might be said of Irish Catholics and Miami Jews . The main virtue of Epis/copalians is their gift for reticence . Seldom can an Episcopalian ( or an Anglican ) be taken for a Christian . Perhaps that is what I like about them . A mystery : If the good news is true , why is not one pleased to hear it ? And if the good news is true , why are its public proclaimerssuch assholes and the proclamation itself such a weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the God of the good news must be a very devious fellow indeed , fond of playing tricks . But perhaps two can play at that game . As unacceptable as believers are , unbelievers are even worse , not because of the unacceptability of unbelief but because of the nature of the unbelievers themselves who in the profession and practice of their unbelief are even greater assholes than the Christians . The present-day unbeliever is a greater asshole than the present-day Christian because of the fatuity , blandness , incoherence , fakery , and fatheadedness of his unbelief . He is in fact an insane person . If God does in fact exist , the present-day unbeliever will no doubt be forgiven because of his manifest madness . The present-day Christian is either half-assed , nominal , lukewarm , hypocritical , sinful , or , if fervent , generally offensive and fanatical . But he is not crazy . The present-day unbeliever is crazy as well as being an asshole  --  which is why I say he is a bigger asshole than the Christian because a crazy asshole is worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he finds himself born into a world of endless wonders , having no notion how he got here , a world in which he eats , sleeps , shits , fucks , works , grows old , gets sick , and dies , and is quite content to have it so . Not once in his entire life does it cross his mind to say to himself that his situation is preposterous , that an explanation is due him and to demandsuch an explanation and to refuse to play out anotheract of the farce until an explanation is forthcoming . No , he takes his comfort and ease , plays along with thep190game , watches TV , drinks his drink , laughs , curses politicians , and now and again to relieve the boredom and the farce ( of which he is dimly aware ) goes off to war to shoot other people  --  for all the world as if his prostate were not growing cancerous , his arteries turning to chalk , his brain cells dying off by the millions , as if the worms . were not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary . The more intelligent he is , the crazier he is and the bigger an asshole he is . He becomes a professorand forms an interdisciplinary group . He reads Dante for its mythic structure . He joins the A.C.L.U. and concerns himself with the freedom of the individual and does not once exercise his own freedom to inquire into how in God 's name he should find himself in such a ludicrous situation as being born in Brooklyn , living in Manhattan , and being buried in Queens . He is as insane as a French intellectual . It has taken me all these years to make the simplest discovery : that I am surrounded by two classes of maniacs . The first are the believers , who think they know the reason why we find ourselves in this ludicrous predicament yet act for all the world as if they do n't . The second are the unbelievers , who do n't know the reason and do n't care if they do n't . The rest of my life , which will be short , shall be devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quid  --  if there is one . If not , we are stuck with the two alternatives : ( 1 ) believers , who are intolerable , and ( 2 ) unbelievers who are insane . I may be a member of the second class , the unbelievers , and no doubt an even greater asshole than they since they generally perform good works , help niggers , pore whites , etc. , but at least I 'm not crazy . Unlike them I demand an explanation and at last have contrived a way of determining either what it is or that there is none . For some time I had believed that the Jews were a sign , a clue to the mystery , a telltale bent twig , a blazed sapling in an otherwise riotous senseless jungle.  |p191But  now it appears the Jews may have not left North Carolina after all , and in fact are making porno flicks and building condos and villas in Highlands , enjoying the leaves , and in general behaving like everyone else . There goes the last sign . Granted then that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbelievers , are not only equally repulsive but also equally unpersuasive , what is one to do ? To the best of my knowledge , only one man in history ever made a practical proposal , that is , a proposal of which the rare sane unbeliever could at least make a modicum of sense . That was the famous wager of Pascal , who was the last French intellectual who was not insane . Though it has never been taken seriously , it does after all make sense . One makes the bet that God exists , though one does n't know for sure . One could just as well bet that he does not exist . But it is better to bet that he does because if he does , the bettor wins and picks up all the marbles . If God does not exist , the bettor has lost nothing . He has everything to win and nothing to lose . If he bets against God , he has everything to lose and nothing to win . But it is after all ludicrous to reduce the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , about believers and unbelieversand Pascal 's bettor . What he said was I 'm having no part of any of you . Excuse me but I wo n't have it . Good day , gentlemen . That 's one way . The trouble with Pascal 's wager is its frivolity . The trouble with my father 's exit is that it yields no answers . It does n't even ask a question . I 've discovered a better way , a more scientific method , in fact an experiment . If I 'm going to spatter my brains around the Great Smokies , it will happen because my question was not answered , not because it was n't asked . And I will not pull the trigger . And my beneficiary will be assured of receiving his million from Prudential . There is an extra pleasure in killing two birds with onep192stone : solving the so-called mystery of life and beating the Rock at the same time . My project is the first scientific experiment in history to settle once and for all the question of God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of his existence but they point both ways and are therefore ambiguous and so prove nothing . For example , the wondersof the universe do not convince those most conversant with the wonders , the scientists themselves . Whether or not this testifies to the stupidity of scientists or to God 's success at concealing himself does n't matter . The peculiar history of the Jews may be a sign but no one sees it as such except possibly the Jews themselves . But if the Jews have stayed in North Carolina ( I must verify this ) and not returned to Israel , their staying is no more a sign than the blacks leaving for the North or the blacks returning to the South . But what if one should devise a situation in which one 's death would occur if and only if God did not manifesthimself , did not give a sign clearly and unambiguously , once and for all ? Would not the outcome of such an experiment be a clear yes or a clear no , with no maybes ? Unless I am mistaken , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive as the famous **25;6958;TOOLONG which asked a question about the nature of space which could only be answered by a yes or a no , no maybes allowed . We have had five thousand years of maybes and that is enough . Can you discover a single flaw in this logic ? I 've got him ! No more tricks ! No more deus absconditus ! Come out , come out , wherever you are , the game 's over . No , I do not mean to joke . What I am doing is asking God with the utmost respect to break his silence . No , not asking . Requiring.  |p193Did  n't Jacob , a Jew , require an answer of God by hanging on to him , rassling him until God got fed up with this Jew ( what have I done to have picked out such a nagging stiff-necked people ? ) and gave him what he wanted . How odd of God to choose the Jews . God no longer makes appearances as a rassler , but I have my own way of getting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My experiment is simply this : I shall go to a desert place and wait for God to give a sign . If no sign is forthcomingI shall die . But people will know why I died : because there is no sign . The cause of my death will be either his nonexistence or his refusal to manifest himself , which comes to the same thing as far as we are concerned . Only you know the nature of the experiment . I give you permission to publish the results in a scientific journal of your choice . Will it not be a relief to all of mankind to have this dreary question settled once and for all , proved or disproved ? Imagine ! We shall no longer have to listen to preachers haranguing unbelievers about God 's existence , and professors haranguing people about God 's nonexistenceand mythic structures ? For obvious reasons I can not tell you where I am going to conduct this experiment . For if I did and the result was negative , you might spill the beans , mount a search , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance . Who is the beneficiary ? You are the beneficiary . Does that surprise you ? Then it shall happen so : either you shall hear from me within three weeks or you shall not . If you do not hear , then I ask that you carry out the mission , make the trip to North Carolina , mail the soiled envelope at the Linwood post office . If you do hear from me , I will at that time tell you the nature of the affirmative result of my experiment , that is , the nature of the sign I have received.  |p194The  reason I make you beneficiary is twofold . One , as you may have surmised , is to increase the incentive for your visit to North Carolina , whether you think I am crazy or not . For if the enclosed letter does not reach Lewis Peckham , my body will never be found and your insurance payment will he delayed seven years . The other reason is that even if the answer to my little experiment is no , I wish you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enforce my request , I nevertheless make it and hope that you will continue the investigation , particularly since you will have the financial means of doing so and I expect you will also be interested . To be specific : I wish you to monitor the demographic movement of Jews not only from North Carolina but from other states and other countries as well , to take note of any extraordinary changes which go contrary to establisheddemographic patterns  --  such as the emigration of blacks from the South ( and their present return ) . If , for example , there has occurred or should occur a massive exodus of Jews from the U.S. to Israel , I request that you establish an observation post in the village of Megiddo in the narrow waist of Israel ( the site , as you may know , of ancient Armageddon ) , where a foe from the east would logically attempt to cut Israel in two . From this point you can monitor any unusual events in the Arab countries to the east , particularly the emergence of a leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't see any reason why you ca n't just as easily live in the Israeli desert as the New Mexican . Instead of watching TV docudramas , why not a ringsideseat for the real thing ? I shall leave it to your best judgment how to evaluate such events and what action , if any , to take , e.g. , whether to inform the media what is afoot . Though I am no great lover of mankind , I believe that people have the right to whatever information may help them to reach the right decision . If you had proof that Southern California wouldp195slide into the ocean next Tuesday , would you not at least put a notice in the L.A. Times ? Finally , I trust that none of these unusual requests will be necessary , not the delivery of the letter to North Caroline , not your removal to Megiddo , that instead you will receive a telephone call from me . A few days will tell the story . Again : please destroy this letter after reading and digestingit . Sincerely yours , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his desk and paced up and down , hands deep in pockets , frowning , lips pursed , for all the world as if he were back in his Wall Street office rehearsing an argument before a probate judge . But what a difference ! What would Dr. Sutter Vaught make of this letter ? Imagine Sutter in Albuquerque , picking up his mail , turning on Cronkite , flopping down in his recliner after a day 's work with paraplegics in the V.A . hospital , opening his beer , then opening a letter which proposed first a trip by plane and bus to North Carolina ( he had not owned a car since his Edsel gave out ) , then a permanent removal to a fleabittenvillage in Israel  --  to say nothing of the references to God 's existence or nonexistence , Armageddon , and the appearance of the Antichrist during the Last Days ! Leaving aside what any psychiatrist  --  or any sensible person  --  would think of Barrett 's preoccupation with God , Jews , Armageddon , and suchlike , one might nevertheless wonder how in fact Sutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Carolina and mail a soiled letter in the Linwoodpost office . The fact is that Will Barrett , crazy or not , might well have made a shrewd choice of a confidant . Even if Dr. Sutter Vaught thought he was as mad as a hatter , he would nevertheless very likely carry out the assignment , whether as a matter of curiosity and the simple oddness of it , or from a kind of quirky sense of obligation , or as an investment in the interestingrole of beneficiary of a million-dollar life-insurancep196policy . Can a madman change his beneficiary ? Who can say ? At any rate , Will Barrett suddenly bethought himself and , seating himself again at the desk , took up pen and added a postscript . P.S. I wish there was a way to tell my daughter Leslie goodbye but there is not . Perhaps you will do it for me if it is necessary . If the result of the experiment is positive , then she and I will have found common ground . I will acknowledge her Lord . If not , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose a time at your convenience and convey this message to her : that even though she never seemed to need me , I am sorry I was such a rotten father . No doubt the fact that she never needed me sprang from her perception of my unavailability , coldness , shutoffness . These awful distances within a family  --  was it always so ? But I 've always been suspicious of the word " love , " what with its gross abuse and overuse . There is no cheaper word . I ca n't say tell her I " love " her , because I do n't really know what " love " means except as it applies to one 's feeling for children  --  and then it may only mean one 's sense of responsibility for their terrible vulnerability , which they never asked for . One loves children , especially one 's own , because there they are , through no doing of their own , born into the same low farce you and I are living but not knowing it yet , being in fact as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them so . Would n't we ? Is that love ? Perhaps my experiment will shed some light that will be helpful to them later . But there is nothing I can say to her now . She is a Christian and the angriest person I know . When she was five years old and we were living in New York , she got hit by a car in Central Park . I thought she was going to die . She was in great pain . When she lay in her hospital bed she looked up at me and asked me , " Why ? " " Why what ? " I said , but I knew what she meant . I opened my mouth to say something , but there was nothing to say except that I did n't know why and that I would gladly have given my life to stop her from hurt/ing , but she did n't want to hear that . I gnawed my arm at the prospect of her suffering . Is that love ? Now when she finishes a Pentecostal service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which scares hell out of me . Is that love ? Count me out . Leslie will inherit a great deal of money . She has n't needed me since she went to the Brearley School in New York . ( Or is it that I imagined that I did n't need her ? ) But if my little experiment works out , I hope to find common ground with her , perhaps enough to share with her in her " love-and-faith community "  --  Jesus , why does this expression give me the creeps ? If not , tell her in your own words , that I love  --  tell her . Moving quickly now , he folded the pages and inserted them with the letter to Lewis Peckham into the larger envelope , which he carefully sealed . Opening a wall safe , he removed an insurance policy , read it , took down his old Harvard hornbook on Wills &; Testaments , and wrote a letter to the Prudential Insurance Company requestinga change in beneficiary . He directed them to send the new policy to Dr. Sutter Vaught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Barrett went mad . His peculiar delusion and the strange pass it brought him to would be comical if it were not so perilous . This unfortunate man , long subject to " spells , " " petty-mall " trances , and such minor disorders , had now gone properly crazy . This is how crazy he was . He had become convinced that the Last Days were at hand , that the world had fallen into the hands of the only species which knew how to destroy itself along with all other living creatureson earth , that whenever in history this species had invented a weapon , it had forthwith used it ; that it was characteristicof this species that , through a perversity or an upsidedownness peculiar to it , while professing a love of peace and freedom and life , secretly it loved war and thralldom and death and loved them to a degree that it , the species , in these last days behaved like creatures possessed by demons ; that thep198end would come by fire , a fire such as had not been seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire which would consume the earth . The very persons who spoke most about " people 's democracy " or " the freedom and sacredness of the individual " were most likely , he was convinced , to be possessedby demons . Madness ! Madness ! Madness ! Yet such was the nature of Will Barrett 's peculiar delusion when he left his comfortable home atop a pleasant Carolina mountain and set forth on the strangest adventure of his life , descended into Lost Cove cave looking for proof of the existence of God and a sign of the apocalypse like some crackpot preacher in California.  |p199Allison  squatted in the sunlight on the creeper , a coil of rope slung over each shoulder , a double metal block in one hand , single in the other , which she hefted absently as she gazed up at the stove . It was getting cold . A cirrus feather of ice crystals stood in six miles high from Canada . During the day she and the dog followed the sun to keep warm . At night she curled up in the NATO sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either move the stove or buy a new Peerless kerosene heater . But it offended her sense of thrift and propriety to waste the stove . And she did n't want to stink up the greenhouse . There was plenty of wood . Pine cones and dead chestnut from the forest and all manner of charred timber from the ruin . So the stove was the thing . Anyhow , she was a hoister , a mistress of mechanical advantage . And here was something to hoist . If she could hoist this monster of a Grand Crown stove , she could do anything in life . But first count your money . Make your list , assemble your words , then visit the hardware store for blocks and tackle , wrenches , WD-4o , plastic pipe and sleeves . Next , Washau Motors for creepers ( she would need four , she figured , one for each foot of the Grand Crown ) . It was only after she left the hardware store , coils of rope slung over each shoulder , plastic pipe tied in a surprisingly light bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrenches  --  she had all the words and got the things without pointing  --  and walked in the service entrance of Washau Motors , that she realized she had forgotten the most importantp200word of all  --  no , not forgotten his name , had never had his name , never even thought of him as having a name . She had two names though , creeper and Jerry the parts man . A mechanic was moving on a creeper under a car . It was only when he winked at her that she realized she had been watching him or rather watching the action of the creeper with its queer swiveling wheels . She frowned and turned away , fell back to reconnoiter . How to get four creepers without the name of the creeper owner ? It took a plan . She had one . She had a name , but she needed another . Next to a field of used cars she spied a husky young black man washing a Ford Galaxy on a rack . He wore a Go Wolves sweatshirt . She knew about the Wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even deferred to her with a small courtesy , turning ever so slightly toward her as if he meant to share with her his hosing down the Galaxy . " Do you play with the Wolves ? " " Yeah , " he said , frowning . She perceived that he had second thoughts about his courtesy and decided to make up for it . " Offense ? " He looked at the sky . " Cornerback . " " Are you going to win State ? " " You better believe it . " " I had better ? " " What ? " he said heavily . " Are you acting like somebody else ? " she asked , eyeing him . " What ? " he asked quickly . " Nothing . I hope you win . " " Why , thank you . " " What 's the man 's name here ? I 'm supposed to see him but I ca n't remember his name . " " The man ? " He almost looked at her and almost smiled , trying , she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might imagine he talked . " You mean the boss or the owner ? " " The owner . " " Oh . Mister Barrett . " Did she imagine it or was there a certain affection in his voice ? Or was it a smiling indulgence ? " Right . John Barrett . " " No no . Will . Mister Will Barrett . "  | " Will Barrett . " Will Barrett . She repeated it to herself . How did the name go with him ? How to take the name ? She tried to locate him in the name . Was he a kind of Will Scarlet of the woods ? " What do you think of him ? " This question , even she knew , gas not suitable , but what did she have to lose ? She needed to hear others speak of him . " Of who ? Mister Barrett ? He nice as can be . He going to send me to Princeton "  --  he began but suddenly , taking thought , changed his mind and became chesty and huffy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like Ludean 's . " Like I told him , I already got six scholarship offers from the ACL prior to his . " Prior . She gazed at him curiously . Why did he flip-flop so fast , from courtesy to huffiness ? " Why  --  " she began and fell silent . On the other hand , if you are curious , why not ask ? Is there a law against asking ? " Why are you pouting ? " " What 's that ? " He ducked his head toward her . " Is it because your hands are cold and this is a poor job compared with a job inside as a mechanic or a salesman ? " " What ? What you talking about , pouting ? " He stared at her , open-mouthed . " Lady , what you talking about ? " " I was just wondering  --  " " Lady , if you got any questions , ax inside . " " Very well . Thank you and good luck in the game . " " Sho , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . Goodbye . " For some reason people had stopped sayinggoodbye . Very well . Suddenly she noticed something . She could say goodbye ! She was n't afraid to state her business , say goodbye , and leave ! She was n't afraid of hurting feelings . No , her desire to please everybody had given way to an immense curiosity . What in the world made people so jumpy ? Jerry the parts man was sitting behind a counter reading a magazine named Hustler . She rapped . He looked up , frowning . " Are you Jerry ? " " Yeah 'm . " " I came by to pick up my creepers , " she declared . She had no trouble making a flat declaration.  | " What creepers ? " " Did n't Mr. Barrett call ? " " Oh yeah . You a friend of Mr. Barrett 's ? " His face had a new hooded expression . She frowned . " Yes . " " Uh huh . " She was astounded . Was he leering at her ? " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me that hustler look , you pimplehead , or I 'll hustle you upside the head . Why did she assemble these words , taking them not from the young black at the washrack but from Ludean the cook ? " He did n't mention four . " " I mentioned four . Call him . Tell him that will leave only ninety-six from the hundred you ordered by mistake . " " Yes ma'am . " While he stacked the creepers for her , she used the two nylon cords she 'd already cut , one to lash the creepers togetherand lash the half-dozen lengths of ten-foot plastic pipe atop the creepers ( the pipe as strong and light as weightless moon pipe ) , the other to tie to the bottom creeper as a pull cord . Off she went down Church Street , backpack heavy with blocks , creepers rattling behind her , but feeling strong . Pavementlasted to the country club . Then : would the creepers creep on a dry golf links ? They did . But now as she surveyed stove and terrain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way than shoeing each foot of the Grand Crown with a creeper and dragging it over the littered ruin . She was a hoister , not a dragger . The great stove had come out of the dark earth with a crack and a suck , roots popping . It reminded her of her father extractinga molar . The only trouble , requiring three false starts , came from knotting the sling properly and gauging the angle of pull in such a way as to clear the cellar stairwell with no more than a bump or two . A problem this and therefore a pleasure in the solving . But a pain also : the price of the rope . Figuring the weight of the stove at around eight hundred pounds  --  she could barely lift one corner as she reckoned she could barely lift a two-hundred-pound man  --  she calculatedp203she needed an eight-to-one mechanical advantage . How to get it ? with a tackle of one double block and one triple block ! But there was another calculation : lifting the stove twenty-five feet would require not twenty-five but 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a half-inch W.P.S. nylon ( mfg. in Madison , Georgia ) at 350 @ foot , break strength 5,500 lbs . $42.75 ! ! ! The blocks were even worse : 2 simple pulleys @ $4.87 ( for making a single block and tackle for smaller loads ) , 2 Wichita Falls steel double blocks @ $29.52 , 1 triple block @ $43.71 ! Her cash reserve was devastated . She counted her money : $171.77-and she still had to buy plastic pipe and sleeves , stove polish , Brasso , and her meager groceries . But what blocks ! Smooth satiny metal good for years of hoisting . And what a rope ! Even as the blocks closed above her and the great ungainly molar of a stove popped out of its socket , the tackle running so smoothly through the blocks that she could pull with one hand , the tail of the rope lay loosely in her other hand as limber , supple , and heavy as a snake . There was always use for such a rope ! In fact : why not rig a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hang the stove on a pulley , and let it down the gentle slope like a trolley ? Okay , except that , with her feel for angles and hefts , she gauged the distance from near chimney to greenhouse : yes , she could stretch the rope with the block and tackle as tight as you please , tighter than barbed wire , the break strength of the rope would stand it , but not the chimney . Her eye told her this . To clear the rubble and laurel and to allow for the down drag of the stove , she 'd have to rig the rope high on the blackened chimney . The mortar might n't hold . She could n't take the chance . Double half-hitching the tail around a stump of laurel , she covered the cellar hole with shards of stout two-by-six lumber and let the stove down . Now that it was landed and only now did she give herself leave to take a good look at it . What a stove ! It was a castle of a stove , a rambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with spires and turrets and battlements . A good six feet high and eight feet wide , it was made of heavily nickeled iron castings bolted together . Tim/idly she rubbed the metal with one finger . It was dirty but not rusty . Panels of porcelain enamel , turquoise blue for the oven doors and the four warming closets , little balconies jutting out head-high , snowy white for the splashback , were fused to heavy cast iron between frames of nickel . Bolted on one side was a nickel-iron box lined with heavy copper and fitted with a spigot . A water reservoir ! On the other side , the firebox with a bay window of a door glazed with panes of mica , some crazed , some crystallized , but all intact . She opened the fire door . Inside was a grate , barely used to judge from the blacking , evidently a coal grate with four sides curling up like heavy petals , but observe : the end grates were attached by a single bolt and easily removable to accommodate logs , threefootlogs ! Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanesque tower , yet another heater , it seemed , crowned by a nickeled dome , a great urn top fitted in turn with an ornamental temperature indicator ( unbroken ! ) . What was this ? a newfangled 1899 water heater ? ( No , there was the copper reservoir which heated from the firebox . ) A separate coal heater for sticking through kitchen wall into dining room ? With a flue arrangement served by the main firebox so that , except in very cold weather , the two rooms could be heated from the firebox ? She would see . An hour she allowed herself and the dog to inspect her treasure in the sunlight , enough time to make sure it was in one piece and not only not rusted but , under the soot and grease and ashes , new . It must have been purchased shortly before the house burned , the super-stove of the nineteenth century , installed in the huge kitchen where during the fire it had the good fortune to settle early through the burning joists and into the cooled damped-down cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove ! Tut can keep his gold mummy case . Carefully , as the sunlight came full in her face , bejeweling her eyelashes , she sprayed the bolt on the coal grate with WD-4o and attached the two crescent wrenches ( 10 " Fullers , $7.95 each ! ) . The nut held tight , but WD-4o seeped between metal . She wedged the inside wrench and took the outside inp205her strong boy 's hands : no way for you to go , friend , but around . It went . A decision must be made . If the Grand Crown could not be dragged or hoisted , how to get it to the greenhouse ? Piece by piece , and why not , since she had to dismantle it anyway to get it into the potting room ? Then I will , disassemble it piece by piece , clean and oil each bolt , polish the nickel , black the iron , wipe porcelain with a clean cloth . Then rebuild it in the potting room against the partition of double-hung sashes , open one to admit the drawbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper  --  enough to keep the frost off her greens ? Screwed to the front , extending the length of the reservoir , oven and firebox , was what she could only think to be a towel rack , a heavy nickeled bar begrimed by grease and ash . No , not a rack for towels but for a wet wash on a rainy day ! Unscrewing a can of Brasso ( $2.05 ) , which had an efficacious stink of ammonia and sulfur cream , she dabbed a clean rag ( from a 1910 shirtwaist ? ) and scrubbed a length of bar . Under her hand the nickel winked in the sunlight like the sterling Ludean polished in the pantry on Saturday mornings . She wrote in her notebook . For tomorrow : find rest of flue pipe in cellar . End of week : fit plastic pipe with sleeves and two elbows ( one elbow under waterfall , other elbow over reservoir ) , string through laurels from waterfall to potting room ( figure how to get pipe in without breaking a window : use hole in peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow yet gentle enough to rig a wire lift to stop flow : up equals stop , down equals flow . The sun sank behind the pines . It must be four o'clock . Her back was cold . The dog stuck his muzzle under her knee . Let 's start moving inside , she said to dog and stove . Working fast now with her wrenches , she unbolted the reservoir . The copper-and-iron box weighed as much as she but she did n't need hoist or creeper . She walked it , handling it downhill from corner to corner like the porter moving a steamer trunk from this very house . At the greenhouse porch she got it up ( a hoist was too much trouble ) and onto the creeper and zip , alongp206silky cement to potting room . She eyed the sashes of the partition . Would the stove fit ? Assuredly . The sashes worked . Better move stove from bottom up . Start with great nickel claw-and-ball feet , clean , reassemble , bolt to base , and build castle thereon stone by stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its back , gently , using the block and tackle to pull it over and braking its fall with the half-inch nylon rappeled around the lonesome pine . She looked at the sky . She figured she had a week.  |p207The  next two hours passed as swiftly as if his secretary , Miss Nabors , had walked into his Wall Street office and given him his appointment calendar . After dressing in jeans , T-shirt , windbreaker , and tennis shoes , he went into the bathroom and emptied a bottle of Placidyl capsules into his hand , two handsful , one for each pants pocket  --  it was Vance Battle 's prescription for his insomniabut he discovered he preferred lying awake  --  wrapped the empty bottle in toilet paper , crushed it with the Greener stock , flushed shards and paper . The plastic top would n't flush , so he opened a window and shied it into the gorge . I could use about forty-eight hours ' sleep , he thought . Then I 'll be ready to wait and watch and listen . Then I 'll take anotherlittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hip pocket under the windbreaker , he scooped up envelopes , went out into the hall and down the back stairs to the garage , got into his Mercedes , and drove to town . He bought four fresh alkaline batteries for his flashlight , a roll of aluminum foil , a manila envelope , visited the post office , where he bought stamps from Mrs. Guthrie and had a conversationabout the fog . You look like you 're going fishing , said Mrs. Guthrie . He was surprised . Fishing ? Yes , something like that , he said . A fishing trip . She would report the conversation later , it and his cheerfulness . Another thirty minutes and the envelope had been stamped and dropped in the slot , the Mercedes parked behind the busp208station , and he was walking down the middle of number-fifteen fairway of the back eighteen . The fog surrounded him . A hole in the cloud traveled with him . As he walked , the hole seemed to be still while the earth turned under him . Though he could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment when he did not know exactly where he was . By dead reckoning he came onto number-seventeen tee , which loomed suddenly in the cloud like an Indian mound . The golf links was like his own soul 's terrain . Every inch of it was a place where he had been before . He knew it like a lover knows his beloved 's body . It was possible without looking to know that one particular spot on the tee , a patch of grass near the right blue marker , would be harder used than the rest , have more scuff marks , broken tees , tee holes , because the fairway doglegged to the left , so drivers teed up as far to the right as they could . He stopped and leaned over . It was even possible , he noted without surprise , to identify the exact spot , a tuft of grass with a bare spot behind it shaped like Arkansas , where he had teed up three days ago . He walked straight to a pine tree near the edge of the rough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a tournamentover the weekend . Golf balls had bombarded the tree . Chips of bark littered the grass at the base . The shell of a cicada hard as a gold bug had been clamped to the tree for three years . His fingers felt the slit in the shell where the creature had escaped . It seemed to grow colder . Something else was different . Perhapsit was the silence that pressed into his ears . He looked at his watch . It was five o'clock . It was only at this moment that he remembered his tryst in the summerhouse with Kitty . It was enough to bring him up short , but after shaking his head and smiling at it  --  perceiving , let us admit it , a mild pang of regret in the groin  --  he was on his way again . Who knows , he thought smiling , in one week , two weeks , I may be sitting with Kitty in the summerhouse enjoyingthe fall sunshine . Kitty 's ass will keep for two weeks or for eternity . Without further ado he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ducking through ) , thenp209moving more slowly , sidling through briars and laurel , came straight to the sassafras no larger than a shrub growing at the base of the ridge . It had fewer leaves now and they were more speckled . He picked a small one shaped not like a three-fingered hand but like a mitt with a thumb . As he sucked the stem , air stirred against his cheek . It was not cooler or warmer than the cloud but different . The cloud smelled of complex leaf rots , bark tannin , and funky anise from the gorge . The cave air was simpler . It had a wet metal culvert smell . He opened his mouth . Clean ferrous ions blew onto his tongue . Pushing aside a branch of sassafras , he stepped into an inconsequentialniche of rock which would have appeared as no more than a lichened recess even without the sassafras , then squeezed sideways through a crack ( the Confederates were thinner , even , than he ) , in the same movement turning past a lip of rock as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and was in the cave . It pleased him that the great cave should have such a banal entrance . Far below in the valley at the proper entrance to Lost Cove cave an underground river flowed into the sunlight through a cathedral arch of stone . You disappeared , one second standing in a lichened niche , then a little jog and into the cave . Lewis Peckham said the entrance was too neat and therefore probably man-made or at least man-shaped , by the Confederates as an escape hole in case they got hemmed up below . Down , down he crawled , letting himself feet first down a rockslide , first prone then supine because he needed the flashlight . There was no way , he figured , to go wrong going down . He wished for a miner 's head lamp and , thinking of it , seemed to catch a whiff of acetylene . The slide leveled gradually and entered a crawl . Dry rock gave way to wet clay . The crawl was longer than he remembered , a good hundred yards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor that he had to turn his head sideways like a baby getting through a pelvis . Progress could only be made by a slow scissors kick and rowing with his elbows . Once he got stuck . The mountain pressed on his back . When the crawl opened suddenly into a chamber the size of a small theater , he stood and walked across as quickly as a manp210going to work , crossed the lobby of his office building , mounted a shelf of rock which fell away into another slide , longer but not as steep as the first . It was possible to go down standing , using the light and choosing his footing carefully . There was pleasure in planning each step , calculating distance and angle of rock and using his weight either to fetch up or to carry him onto the next step . It was not hard work but when he reached the stream at the bottom he was sweating . There was a curving beach of gravel . As he played the light into the clear shallow water , it was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were minnows . Perhaps they were blind . But when he shone the light up , it showed a glittering lopsided vault , one side sloping steeply to join a cliff across the stream . The glitter , he saw , came from needles of stone , each holding a drop of water . Beyond a promontory crouched the three nuns , humpy becowled stalagmites . When the cave was open to tourists , there was a blue floodlight behind the nuns . Lewis said that what people liked was not nature but likenesses in nature . Rather than see stalagmites , they would rather see stalagmites that looked a little like nuns . There were also formations called the Old Man of the Mountain , and Honest Abe , and Marse Robert . It took another hour to find the chimney . It began , he remembered , as a sort of flue above a tilted slab of a boulder . But there were many such slabs . Twice he passed the entrance to the lair where Lewis had found the tiger , but did not bother to enter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found it , the opening was higher than he remembered . Before he went up , he made sure to leave footprints of heavy wet clay in plain view on the rock . It took both hands to jump straight up into the dark and catch hold and double over onto a shelf of rock . The chimney was directly above , a rough skewed cylinder a yard or so wide . With each step up he had to wedge himself like a chimney sweep to free one hand and use the light to plan the next step . Could this have been another Confederatebeaver hole to escape the blue tide ? No , because at its top it opened not up and to the outside but to one side and into a small curiously shaped chamber elongated in one dimensionp211but rounded top and bottom like a pod . Tiger bones had been found here too . A knob of rock the size of a hassock rose from the stone floor at the smaller blind end of the pod . It looked a little like the great flattened head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone on each side where the massive jaw muscle attached . Could the tiger 's skull have fused into rock over the years , dripped on by jeweled drops and turned calcareous and huge ? But no , it was a rock shaped vaguely like a tiger 's skull , enough to allow the cave operator to call it the Sleeping Tiger . Lewis said the tiger had died here thirty-two thousand years ago . Water dripped on one side of the chamber and filled a saucer of stone . Good ! It would be uncomfortable and unnecessaryto die of thirst . It was quite comfortable sitting against the curving wall . Head high , he found a dry alcove for the flashlight . Next to it he stood the four fresh batteries . Emptying his pockets of Placidyl capsules , he carefully lined them up on the floor and counted them . Ninety-six . The roll of aluminum foil fitted on , packaged , and put away , else he 'd foul his own den . What had the tiger done ? He smiled . Here I am , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now . Now we 'll see . Who else but a madman could sit in a pod of rock under a thousand feet of mountain and feel better than he had felt in years , feel so good that he smiled again and snapped his fingers as if he had made a discovery ? I 've got you both , he said aloud , God-seekers and suicides , I 've got you all , God , Jews , Christians , unbelievers , Romans , Jutes , Angles , Saxons , Yankees , rebs , blacks , tigers . At last at last at last . It took me a lifetime , but I 've got you by the short hairs now . One of you has to cough it up . There is no way I can not find out . Even if worst comes to worst , he thought with a smile , to suicide , it will turn out well . My suicide will represent progressin the history of suicide . Unlike my father 's , it will be done in good faith , logically , neatly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall arrange to be found.  |p212What  is more , it will advance knowledge . His plan was simple : wait . The elegance of it pleased him . As cheerfully as a puttering scientist who hits on a simple , elegant experiment which will , must , yield a clear yes or no , he set about his calculations . The trick was to devise a single wait which would force one of two answers , not more , not less . If a yes , then to be able to leave and act on the yes . If a no , then to act on the no and at the same time euchre the Prudential Insurance Company out of the money he felt coming to him , to leave Sutter one million richer , and so to be found with the Placidyl gone from the floor of the cave but gone also from his blood . Lewis would find him eventually -- Ah , to make doubly sure , drop a note down the chimney . He did : Help ! he wrote . With tiger , fifty feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know which tiger . He wrote another note . I 'm fifty feet above this place and ca n't move . I think I 've had a small stroke or an arterial spasm . Vance Battle had told him about arterial spasms . They could mimic a stroke yet an autopsy would show nothing . The second note he folded and dropped down the shaft . Ninety-six capsules . Three a day could give him tranquillity for thirty-two days . Then he 'd be too weak to move anyhow and yet live long enough to get rid of the drug . This way everybody wins . God , if he exists , is not affronted . If he does n't , Sutter gets the one million . There will be plenty of time for asking God  --  that is called prayer !  --  between knockout drops . I am no hero ! to sit here for a month and starve without a drug is too much of a bore to consider . Speak , God , or be silent . And if you 're silent , I 'll understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see visions , o ye old men who dream dreams , who believes you ? O ye suicides who go not so gently into that good nothing , you ca n't tell me either . But I 've beat you both . In either case I 'll know . Speak , God , and let me know if the Jews are a sign and the Last Days are at hand . If the Last Days are at hand , one shall know what to do . Ip213shall go to Megiddo with Sutter and wait for the Stranger from the East . If you do not speak and the Jews are not a sign , then that too is an answer of sorts . It means that what is at hand are not the Last Days but only the last days , my last days , a minor event , to be sure , but an event of importance to me . Unfortunately for the poor man awaiting the Last Days and raving away at God and man in the bowels of Sourwood Mountain directly below thousands of normal folk playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors  --  for on the following day at the height of his lunacy the cloud blew away and the beautiful days of Indian summer began , the mountains glowed like rubies and amethysts , and leafers were out in force  --  unfortunately things can go wrong with an experiment most carefully designed by a sane scientist . A clear yes or no answer may not be forthcoming , after all . The answer may be a muddy maybe . In the case of Will Barrett , what went wrong could hardly be traced to God or man , Jews or whomever , but rather to a cause at once humiliating and comical : a toothache . So in the end not only did he not get a clear answer to his peculiar question , not a yes or a no or even a maybe  --  he could not even ask the question . How does one ask a question , either a profound question or a lunatic question , with such a pain in an upper canine that every heartbeat feels like a hot ice pick shoved straight up into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . He vomited . There is one sure cure for cosmic explorations , grandiose ideas about God , man , death , suicide , and such  --  and that is nausea . I defy a man afflicted with nausea to give a single thought to these vast subjects . A nauseated man is a sober man . A nauseated man is a disinterested man . What does a nauseated person care about the Last Days ? Whether it was God 's doing or ordinary mortal frailty , one can not be sure . What happened in any event , happened after seven or eight days.  |p214It  began well enough . He swallowed three capsules . A complex comfort took root in his stomach and flowed along his spine and into his throat . A simple chemical taste , both bitter and reassuring , rose at the back of his tongue . He fancied it was the taste of the cave . He lay down happily in a hollow of rock and closed his eyes . Now came a different taste and smell . The smell of a warm Negro cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rotogravure section of the Atlanta Constitution thick as quilt and everywhere the close clean smell of coal oil and cornbread and Octagon soap . When he had knocked , the woman had come to the screen door and looked at the blood on his face . She opened the door without a word . The boy John Washingtonwhom his father had cursed was standing behind her , his eyes so big that white showed all around his irises . Will Barrett , feeling the same dead calm and certainty he had felt when he knelt beside the man : " I need some help . My father has been hurt in an accident . I would appreciate it , Mrs. Washington , if you would send your son John to get the sheriff . " The woman 's steady eyes flicked only once as he spoke . Not taking her eyes from him when he finished , she told the boy : " John , you go get High Sheriff Thompson , " and to him after John took off : " You come on over here , boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her and thinking of nothing in particularexcept the smell of newspaper and coal oil . " You gon be all right . " On his cheek he felt the wet rag in gentle but firm wipes like his mother washing his face . Thirty-two thousand years ago the tiger had come here to die . Why ? Had he grown old and lain down in darkness ? Had she come here wounded or to whelp and died instead ? Thirty-one thousand nine hundred years later , some country boys dressed in butternut found a good place to make gunpowder , in Lost Cove and in the very cave where the saltpeter was mined . " They gon find us in here sure'n hell . "  | " No , they ai n't , " said the sergeant . " I heard they was coming up the valley . " " Let them come . We got the magazine mined . They can come right on and get their asses blown back to New York . " " Then how we gon get out ? " " I know another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to care much one way or the other beyond a flicker of pleasure in having it both ways , escaping from the intruders and blowing up the same intruders . He became his father . He was walking down Sunset Boulevard . Here came Chester Morris in a blue Packard convertible . He was wearing a straw katy . After that , Ross Alexander killed himself . After that , he was standing smiling and nodding in Lower Pyne at Princeton , his hands thrust in his pockets in a certain way . Lindbergh shook hands with his grandfather and Eddie Stinsonat the airport . Bobby Jones and Richard Halliburton and Johnny Mercer and Johnny Mack Brown came to dinner . D'Lo served Bobby Jones from the wrong side but Jones , a gentleman , did n't let on that anything was wrong . What are you doing down here in the cold cold ground , massa ? I do n't know , D'Lo .

What 's wrong with these places ? They 're all closed down . There must be a place . After the Spring Regatta picnic at the Northport Beach Club and during the award ceremony when he received his cup , walking up to get it , feet toed in , pants high and dry , right shoulder moving forward with right foot as if he had lived in Long Island all his life , he had caught the eye of Martha Stookey , only daughter and only offspring of Bryan A. Stookey , who owned Stookey Tidewater , which leased a fair portion of the continental shelf and whose business the firm had been after for years . The Lester Lanin orchestra was playingin the pavilion , but nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , had made a mistake . She had come dressed for a tea dance or maybe a garden party . She wore a big round off-the-face hat . Everyone else wore sports clothes or swimsuits . Even in the shadow of the hat , he could see that her face was blotched with unhappiness . Why did God make ugly girls ? It is hard to say . That wasp217God 's affair . But one thing he , Will Barrett , could do was make ugly girls happy . Then was that why God made ugly girls ? So that selfish people like Will Barrett could make them happy and feel less selfish , do two things at once ? No , three things . Make money too . He asked her to dance . Her hand , when he took it , was cold and trembling . She was a good dancer . Other people began to dance . He enjoyed dancing with her . She smiled . She was not ugly . Old man Peabody was looking at him . The look said : That 's my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Peabodysaid to him : " I 'm putting you in charge of Trusts and Testaments .

Vines as big as snakes grew up and grew down like lianas . A waterfall fell a hundred feet . He was waiting for the first session of an ecumenical council on race relations . When he moved to Carolina , he thought for a while it would be a good idea to help out the South " in the area of race relations . " The man , who looked something like him except that he had a mustache and wore a white linen suit with vest , shook his hand and made a grimace . He was an Atlanta lawyer . " Well , the jury found you guilty as charged . " " Guilty of what ? " Jesus , they found me out . Guilty ! " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't feel bad . " " Why not ?

"  | " Not bad , though there is no substitute for freedom . I had a clean cell , good food . My job was to read the dials in the boiler room from midnight to six . I wrote a book . " " It sounds like a good place . You 're looking fine , John . " " You do n't , Will . What have you been doing ?

But this is not a bad place . " Ehrlichman was right . It was not a bad place . Roosevelt was elected shortly after he was born . Roosevelt grinned . Roosevelt was elected again . Roosevelt grinned . Roosevelt was elected again . Will Barrett had never known another President . He was sick of Roosevelt 's grin . Years passed . He woke many times . The cave was companionable . The living rock was warm and dry . There were times when the ceiling of the cave seemed to open to the sky . As he gazed up , the darkness turned bright . Yet he always knew this could n't be so . He smiled at himself . The war came . His father was happy . Most people seemed happy . Fifty million people were killed . People dreamed of peace . Peace came . His father became unhappy . Most people seemed unhappy . The boy lay prone in the Georgia swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , the Sterlingworthshotgun cradled in his arms . Ground fog lay straight as milk , filling the hollows between the pin oaks . So this is how it is , the boy thought , grim and exultant . This is one of the secrets nobody tells you . There are two secrets to life nobody tells you : screwing and dying . What they tell you about is love and the hereafter . Maybe they are right . But it is screwing and dying you have to deal with . What they don'tp219tell you is how good screwing is and how bad it is to grow old , get sick , and die . Very well . He and his daughter Leslie were going home after Marion 's funeral . Yamaiuchi drove the Rolls . The back of his head was as sleek as a seal . He looked like Sammy Lee , the small muscularOlympic diver . Will Barrett was watching the bare winter woods . Why do woods have a certain look after funerals ? He and Marion had gazed at dozens of woods after dozens of funerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's funeral . When the limousine stopped at the railroadcrossing on Theobald Street , a nondescript place he had passed a hundred times walking home from school , he noticed that this place had a different look , an air of suspension , of pause and hiatus , like the policeman at the cemetery who stood still in front of the stopped traffic . This was the same place where he had thought about Ethel Rosenblum and fallen down . Leslie 's granny glasses clashed as she folded the stems . Clearingher throat , she turned toward him . She crossed her legs . The panty hose whispered . Her face with its hazed eyes and thin handsome lips had the expression of Barbara Stanwyck in that part of the movie where she tells everybody off . " Let me tell you something , Poppy . " " Okay . " It is evident that she is not only going to tell me something but also tell me off in that sense in which some people conceive it to be an act of courage to ignore conventionand usage and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope she does n't say , let 's let it all hang out ) . " Poppy , let me say this . " " Okay . " " You and Mom  --  God knows I love you both , but you blew it . You both blew it . " " We did ? " " You better believe it . You both blew it . " " How 's that ? " " Neither of you was ever honest with the other  --  or with yourself . " " How 's that ? " " Not once in your entire married life were you and Momp220ever honest with each other . Yet I am grateful to you because I have learned from it . " " How 's that ? " " You should at least have admitted to each other what your marriage was based on . Then who knows , something might have come out of it , something creative . I 've discovered that the hard way : lying to yourself makes it impossible to be creative in a relationship . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other or to yourselves why you married . " " Why did we marry ? " " You married Mom to get the Peabody fortune . Mom marriedyou  --  I would like to say you were a catch and I guess you were  --  mainly to get married . Now that 's not a bad basis for a relationship  --  the French have been doing it for years  --  as long as you admit it . Mom could not conceive the future without marriage . Fortunately times have changed . " " I see . " " Jason and I level . We believe that only if people level is there a chance of a relationship . " " I see . " What he saw was Marion holding his hand , laughing and running , half dragged , up the slope from the rocky beach , her gray eyes under the wide unplucked brows full on him , never leaving him , and he : he with the sweet pang at his heart  --  pang for what ? for the pleasure she took in him ? for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerability of her which he vowed to protect ? her : gawky , ungood-looking ( Waal now , Will , she ai n't exactly a queen , is she ? his fraternity brothers might say ) yet handsome and direct through the eyes and mouth . Or was it the bittersweetness of the sudden bargainhe struck with himself during this very run up the slope , that he would marry her not because she was rich and decent and he could make her happy , but because his life had come to such a pass that he could at least do this , take an action just for the mystery of it , an action which could n't be bad and might even be a great good . Why not marry her ? Might n't one as well marry as not marry ?  | " Poppy , with all due respect to you and Mom , I 've got to have something better . I 've got to have something better in the way of relationships and I 've got to have something better in the way of a genuine faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what do you live by , Poppy ? " " Ah , I 'm not sure . " " Well , I know what I live by and I want to thank you and Mom for giving me what you did and for making it possible for me to learn , to learn to level with myself and others . " " Ah , you 're welcome . " Once he saw the tiger traveling the highways and byways . But perhaps it was only one of the little explosions of light and color which now and then lit up the fragments of road map , bits of highway , crossroad , dots of towns which drifted across his retina . In the gray watery world , anyhow , no one seemed to notice the tiger . Very well , he thought , neither shall I.In New York , below Columbus Circle , on the platform of the downtown Eighth Avenue Express , hundreds of people stood waiting . Each wore a kind of hood not like a hangman 's hood but lopped over at the peak . He woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing bright or fearful or symmetrical about him . His eyes were lackluster and did not burn . His coat was not thrifty . His muzzle looked more like a snout . Otherwise , there was nothing notable about him . He was as commonplace as the tiger in the picture book the child recognizes and points to . " Tiger , " says the child . The tiger 's head turned this way and that . He swayed as he stood . He was too tired even to unlock his legs and let himself lie down . It was clear he had come to die . Without fear or even curiosity he watched as the beast lay down heavily , its bones knocking against rock . Later when he happened to touch the tiger beside him , which was either dead or dying , he noticed without surprise that the fur and skin had grown as hard as rhinoceros hide . That 's unusual , he thought . Moreover , there had been an unusual expression through the eyes of the tiger before he lay down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger as he often felt toward the patients at St. Mark 's . Have n't you troubled yourself and fretted needlessly over the years ? Did you ever really know your times and seasons ? What a mystery that you should have come here without knowing ! Were you ever really a splendid tiger burning in the forests of the night ? A dry rustle came from the dead tiger like wasps in a gourd . Something was stirring in the carapace of this beast . Perhaps it is a female tiger lying down to whelp . No , this was an old male tiger , a friendly senile child's-picture-book tiger . It was a death rattle . As he absently explored the beast , hide now hardened and chitinous as a locust , his hand felt along the spine as if it were looking for the slit where the creature escaped . There was no slit , but the skin had loosened in preparation for the molt . Molt ? Tigers do n't molt . Be logical . It can be figured out . Very well . Whatever is alive here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a tiger giving birth or a tiger molting and being transformed like a cicada . It is the same tiger but different . He watched curiously until he saw the joke . Then he grew sleepy and lay down beside the beast . The joke was that for the first time in the history of the universe it was the man who knew who he was , who was as snug as a bug in his rock cocoon , and the beast who did not , who was fretful , unsure of himself and the future , unsure what he was doing here . The tiger asked : Is this the place for me ? Will I be happy here ? Will the others like me ? Will my death be a growth experience ? But how can you be dead and grow ? Dead is dead . The man laughed , took three more pills , scooped up water from one of the holes which was as perfectly cylindrical as if it had been drilled by a bit . Tiger or no tiger , he thought , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign . He was vomiting . The pain from the tooth forked up into his head like lightning . I 'm really sick , he thought with interest . Sick as a dog . What could have made me so sick ? the drug ? the toothache ? How long have I been down here ?  |p223He  looked at the row of Placidyl capsules . Not quite half were gone . Six days ? Ten days ? There was the sound of water dripping . A tiger ? John Ehrlichman ? He shook his head . It made him vomit again . But he shook his head again and , gathering flashlightand batteries , started for the opening . Let me out of here . It is astonishing how such a simple and commonplace ailment as pain and nausea can knock everything else out of one 's head , lofty thoughts , profound thoughts , crazy thoughts , even lust . O00000h , he groaned aloud . Let me out of here , he said with no thought of God , Jews , suicide , tigers , or the Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the beginnings of a beard . The trouble was he was weaker and more drugged than he knew . Halfway down the chimney , his knee gave way and he fell the remaining twenty or thirty feet , fortunately bouncing off the walls , else he 'd have surely killed himself , and landed in a heap , bruised and bleeding , at the bottom . He lay quietly for a long time before he began to feel himself for broken bones and serious bleeding . Save for a few scrapes and many bruises on his hips and arms and head , he did n't seem to be badly hurt . The dark pressed in . It did n't matter whether his eyes were open or closed . Suddenly his heart gave a thump . The flashlight ! Certainly it was in his hand when he started down the chimney . How stupid of him not to have brought a spare , a little pocket penlight ! Now , even if he found the light , it was undoubtedly broken . Not even a match or a lighter . The toothache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippled like wheat along his flanks . His scrotum drew up tight as a slipknot . Does fear supplant nausea as nausea supplanted God ? Taking care not to move his body , he felt every square inch around him . No flashlight . Getting up on hands and knees , he almost fainted . Then putting his head down like an anteater , he began to spiral slowly , sweeping the rock with the outer hand . What if the light had landed on a ledge above ? But no . The flashlight was lodged face up in a crevice a good twenty feet from where he had fallen . When his hand closed over the plastic rim , one finger went inside.  |p224The  glass was broken . But the bulb was n't . He pushed the switch . Darkness pressed in . He pushed it again . Darkness pressed in closer . Ah then , this is how things are , things might be settled for me after all . If he had n't been so weak , he would have laughed . What kind of answer is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get euchred honestly , he thought , and tapped the butt of the metal case against the rock . The darkness sprang back like an animal . Limping and aching in every joint , legs spraddled like a drunk 's , he made his way slowly along the beach , not botheringto look for fish , past Honest Abe and the three nuns , and started up the slide . He crossed the theater , but when he came to the upper slide , it was necessary to stop and rest with every step . I 'm weak . I must have been down there a week . His legs and arms trembled . Twice he fell , once badly . He was so weak that , when he felt himself fall , he cradled the flashlight in both arms and let go of his body like a sack of potatoes . It , his body , rolled down a flat rock and wedged under an outcrop . He turned off the light and lay in the dark for half an hour . The nausea and the toothache were better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty . Why was he weak ? How long had he been in this cave haranguing with God , the Jews , tigers , and John Ehrlichman ? Five hours ? Fifty hours ? A week ? He felt his beard . At least a week . This time when he checked his bones , he found that one was probably broken , the small bone below the knee . When he tried to stand , it seemed to want to come through the skin . But there was little pain . It was possible to go on all fours , knees spread . Perhaps the bone was only cracked . It was only after an hour , when at least , by any calculation , he should have gained the top and the opening , that there came the awful sense of loss , like a traveler who even before he slaps his back pocket knows his wallet is missing . Something was missing . He had lost something . What ? The crawl . He had misplaced the crawl . No , he had n't misplaced the crawl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater he should have entered the crawl . Instead , he had started up the slide . It was thep225wrong slide , however . He was lost . A cave is like a river . It is hard to get lost going down . Going up is something else . Turning off the light , he made himself comfortable and took stock . All he knew for certain was that he could not go back to the theater , let alone negotiate the crawl and another slide . Well then  --  he thought , yawned , and either fainted or went to sleep . When he woke , he found himself wondering where he was , what strange bedroom . The toothache was gone , he noticed . He spat out something . Probably pus . The abscess had drained . Then the bad memories opened in his head like doors . This was not a bedroom but a cave . He had lost the crawl . He was very thirsty . It took a long time to stand up . As he shone the light around , he realized he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark spots on the ceiling close above him drizzled . He reached up his free hand . It was not water . Furry bodies fell on him , around him , squeaking . Tiny fans of warm skin brushed against his face . Hooks went through his hair like a comb . The dark spot went away . The rock was dry . The spots were colonies of bats . It was the hats that drizzled . Then , whatever day it was , it was daytime . Bats roost during the day , do n't they ? How did the bats get out ? Did he imagine it or did another , stronger breath of air stir against his cheek . A great bat ? Down on hands and knees again and slowly up the slide . What to do when slide meets roof ? For here in fact slide did meet roof and he crouched in the angle , cleaving against the roof like a bat . He turned off the light . It was only after a minute or so that he realized that it was not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind black retinal dark of the cave . A breath of air stirred his hair . Turning his head as slowly as a sick man greeting a visitor , he saw a shadow on the rock . It was only a shadow , he thought . But consider that my flashlight is turned off . It follows then that the shadow has been made by another source of light . As he crawled along the cave a light breeze sprang up , and by the time he reached the shadow , he could smell leaves and bitter bark and the smell of lichened rock warming in sunlight . But when he turned , he saw , not sunlight but a lattice ofp226vines which all but sealed a hole in the rock . The hole was square . Well then , he said , and noticed that he was not excited about his deliverance from the cave . Then there must be more than one opening in the ridge . But why the square hole ? Perhaps this was the actual escape hatch for the Confederate moles . Even fat Confederates could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , he discovered that the opening was not more than a foot and a half square and head high , the head , that is , of a man on all fours . The square shape came not from the rock but from a wooden frame beyond the rock . A rigor seized him and he shook like a leaf . His teeth chattered . Somewhere above the racket he was thinking that it would be a curious experience to emerge from the cave as a Confederate years later , like a Japanese holdout in the Philippines . Hey you in the Mercedes , who won the war ? Resting elbows on the sill , he meant to poke his head through for a look , but both vines and sill were rotten and he fell , thinking even as he fell that it could n't be much of a fall , what with the vines and the ridge itself not being much higher than a man . But this was a fall through air not vines or bushes , through air and color , brilliant greens and violet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headfirst with time enough to wonder if he might not be dead after all , what with this tacky heaven and the great black beast of the apocalypse roaring down at him , eyes red , jaws open and ravening , when , wood splintering first then exploding into kindling , he hit the table , then concrete , but not too hard , with one shoulder mostly but with the back of his head some . He shut down , turned off like a light . Something was trying to get into his mouth . He clenched his teeth . " You were asking for water . "  |p227He  opened his eyes . Something , someone , a person , a woman , a girl , bent over him with a paper cup . " Okay . " He tried to raise his head to drink properly . It was impossible . Pains shot up his neck . Very well . He had broken his neck . He opened his mouth and she poured water into it . There are few joys greater than drinking cool water after a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a roof of clear glass . I 'm in church . " How did you find me and get me in here ? " " I did n't . You fell in . " " Fell in ? From where ? " " There . " She lifted her face . In the peak of the gambrel roof , where the vent of an attic might be , a square window had been set in the wall against the ridge . He looked at it . " How did I get up here on this table or bed or  --  " " I got you up with my block-and-tackle . " " I see . " " How do you feel ? " " Bad . " " What hurts ? " " Everything , from my leg to my head . I think my leg is broken . " If my leg hurts , he thought , I am probably not paralyzed . " Take these three aspirin and go to sleep . " " Do n't call anyone until I tell you . " " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he woke , she fed him a large bowl of oatmeal . Why had he never noticed how good oatmeal is ? " What were you doing ? Where did you come from ? " she asked after a while . " The cave , " he said absently . He had been looking at the framed hole in the roof peak a long time . " Do you feel anything ? " he asked her . " Yes , a breeze . I had not felt it before . Where does it come from ? "  | " From the cave . " " What 's it for ? " she asked . " To keep the greenhouse warm in winter and cool in summer . How does it feel to you ? " " Cool . But did you notice my  --  " " Yes , because it 's still warm out . " " No , it 's cold outside . " " I judge the cave air is about sixty degrees . It is said to come from air blowing up the gorge and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but did you notice that it is warmer than that in here ? " " Yes , " he said absently . " Can you imagine that vent being there all along and you not noticing it ? " She nodded . " It is both revealing and appealing to me that you cleaned out the vines so my window could catch the breeze from the cave . " " What old Judge Kemp did , " he said more to himself than to her yet watching her closely , " was to back this greenhouse against the vent in the ridge so he could keep it a steady sixty winter and summer . " " So the natural air-condition was for fruition . " " Yes , " he said , closing his eyes . " He made a lot of money . It 's warm in here , warmer than the cave . Hm . " " I know , " she said . " Did you notice a novelty hereabouts ? " " A novelty ? " He opened his eyes and followed her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partition , squatted the huge old kitchen range , no not old but surely new , transformed , reborn . Its polished nickel glittered in the sunlight . Expanses of immaculate white and turquoise enamel glowed like snowy peaks against a blue sky . A fire burned behind amber mica bright as tigers ' eyes . " You moved it . " " I moved it . " " By yourself . " " By myself . Look , it also has a reservoir . " " I see . " " The water is hot . " " Good . "  | " I gave you a bath . To see you was not to believe you . " " Thank you . " " But for now , go to sleep . You 're exhausted . " " Very well . Do n't tell anybody I 'm here . " " Who would I tell ? "  |p233It  was no trouble handling him until he came to and looked at her . She could do anything if nobody watched her . But the moment a pair of eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pin , arms and legs beating the air . There was no purchase . It was an impalement and a derailment . So it had been in school . Alone at her desk she could do anything , solve any problem , answer any question . But let the teacher look over her shoulder or , horror of horrors , stand her up before the class : she shriveled and curled up like paper under a burning glass . The lieder of Franz Schubert she knew by heart , backwards and forwards , as well as Franz ever knew them . But when four hundred pairs of eyes focused on her , they bored a hole in her forehead and sucked out the words . When he landed on the floor of her greenhouse , knocking himself out , he was a problem to be solved , like moving the stove . Problems are for solving . Alone . After the first shock of the crash , which caught her on hands and knees cleaning the floor , her only thought had been to make some sense of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to toe with a whitish grease like a channel swimmer . As her mind cast about for who or what he might be  --  new kind of runner ? masqueraderfrom country-club party ? Halloween trick-or-treater ?  --  she realized she did not yet know the new world well enough to know what to be scared of . Maybe the man falling into her house was one of the things that happened , albeit rarely , like a wood duck flying down the chimney . But wait . Was he a stranger ? Strange as he was , smearedp234with clay and bent double , there was something about the set of his shoulders , a vulnerability in their strength , that struck in her a sweet smiling pang . She recognized him . No , in a way she knew who he was before she saw him . The dog recognized him . It was the dog , a true creature of the world , who knew when to be affrighted and enraged , e.g. , when a man falls on him , who therefore had attacked as before and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the furious growl winding down to a little whine of apology . Again the dog was embarrassed . Perhaps she ought to be an engineer or a nurse of comatose patients . For , from the moment of her gazing down at him , it was only a matter of figuring out how to do what needed to be done , of calculating weights and angles and points of leverage . Since he had crashed through one potting table , the problem was to get him up on the other one . But first make sure he was n't dead or badly hurt . It seemed he was neither , though he was covered with bumps and scrapes and blood and clay . He smelled of a freshly dug ditch . A grave . Again her mind cast about . Had he been digging a well for her in secret , knowing her dislike of help ? But how does one fall from a well ? Perhaps he had found a water supply on the ridge above . She tried to pick him up . Though she was strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though he was thin , he was heavy . He was slippery . His long slack muscles were like straps on iron . When she lifted part of his body , the rest clove to the earth as if it had taken root . Now sitting propped against the wall , the dog 's anvil head on her thigh , she considered . The block-and-tackle she figured gave her the strength of three men . Better than three men . Three men would have demoralized her . Her double and triple pulleys conferred mastery of energy gains and mechanical advantages . With pulleys and ropes and time to plan , one could move anything . Now that she thought of it , why could n't anyone do anything he or she wished , given the tools and the time ? It was hard to understand why scientists had not long ago solved the problems of the world . Were they , the scientists , serious ? How could one not solve any problem , once you put your mind to it , had forty years , and people did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists were not serious . For if people solved the problems of cancer and war , what would they do then ? Who could she ask about this ? She made a note to look it up in the library . She got him up by first rolling him onto a door from the ruin , then , using a single double-gain pulley , hoisted one end of the door enough to slide the creeper under it , then rolled him to her bunk , devised a rope sling for the door , a twostrandhammock , hoisted door by two double-blocks hooked to the metal frame of the gambrel angle in the roof where the vents opened . The trick was to pull the ropes to both systems , then when the pulleys had come together take both ropes in one hand and stack bricks under the door with the other and start over . When the door was a little higher than the cleared bunk , she eased him over door and all , hoisted one end of the door , the head end , high enough to put three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a bath . The only real trouble was getting his clothes off . Pulleys were no use . Man is pitiful without a tool . It took all her sweating gasping strength to tug the slippery khaki over his hips and to roll him over far enough to yank one elbow clear of a sleeve . Why not cut his clothes off ? Then dress him in what ? She considered his underwear shorts . She would n't have minded him naked but perhaps , later , he would . She covered him with her sleeping bag while she drew two pots of water , one for him , one for his clothes , the clothes first so they would have time to dry in the sun . No , the sun would take too long . Instead , she hung the shirt and pants on the nickel towel rack of the great stove . Quel pleasure , putting her stove to such good use ! It took all afternoon . She did n't mind bathing a man . How nice people are , unconscious ! They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comatose patients . Again it was a matter of calculating weights and angles and hefts . The peculiar recalcitrantslack weight of the human body required its own physics . Heaving him over to get at his back , a battleground of cuts and scrapes and caked blood and bruises , she wondered : what had he done , fallen off a mountain ? His face ! With its week 's growth of beard , a heavy streaked **27;6985;TOOLONG , and the lump above his jawbone , he looked like a covite with a wad of chewing tobacco . But only when she finished did she stop to gaze down at him . No , not a redneck . Except for the golfer 's tan of his face and arms , his skin was white , with a faint bluish cast . The abdomen dropping away hollow under his ribs , the thin arms and legs with their heavy slack straps of muscle , cold as clay , reminded her of some paintings of the body of Christ taken down from the crucifix , the white flesh gone blue with death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cheekbones thrust out like knees . He had lost weight . While his beard grew he had not eaten . Exhausted , she cooked a supper of oatmeal and made a salad of brook lettuce and small tart apples from the ruined orchard and hickory nuts . Her back felt looks . She turned around . The dog and the man were watching her , the dog with his anvil head between his paws , the man with his cheek resting on his elbow . The looks did not dart or pierce or impale . They did not control her . They were shyer than she and gave way before her , like the light touch of a child 's hand in the dark . The man looked one way , the dog the other , as if she were not there . Was she there ? The man could not sit up to eat . She fed him . He ate heartily but his eyes , like the dog 's , only met hers briefly and went away as he chewed . She put hot oatmeal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had packed from town by tying it like a blanket roll in the lower flap of the Italian NATO knapsack . Her strength surprised her . She could hoist anything . It was n't bad taking care of him . To tell the truth , before he landed in the greenhouse , she had begun to slip a little . It surprised her . She liked her new life . Physically she was healthy and strong . The hard work of cleaning the greenhouse and moving the stove made her hungry and tired . She atep237heartily and slept like a log . She gained weight . When she caught sight of herself in the shop windows of Linwood , she ( lid not at first recognize the tan towheaded long-haired youth loping along . But looks became more impaling . Some people , most Southernpeople , guard their looks as if they knew what she knew about looks : that they are not like other things . The world is full of two kinds of things , looks and everything else . Some people do not guard their looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket and looked too long . The look made a tunnel . The shelves of cans seemed to curve around the look like the walls of a tunnel . She knew she was not crazy because a can fell off . Some people use their looks to impale . Once , as she walked down the street , her thighs felt a look . She turned around . A dark stout man perhaps from Florida ( most visitors were from Florida ) , perhaps a Cuban , perhaps South American , was not only looking at her buttocks but had bunched his fingers under his chin and was shaking them and making a sucking noise , not a whistle , through his pursed lips . Time became separated into good times and bad times . The nights and mornings were good times . Then along comes late afternoon  --  four o'clock ? five o'clock ? she did n't know because she had no clock and lived by forest time  --  but a time which she thought of as yellow spent time because if time is to be filled or spent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you finish and there is time left over ? The forest becomes still . The singing and clomping of the hikers , the cries of the golfers , the sweet little sock of the Spalding Pro Flites and Dunlop Maxflys , the sociable hum of the electric carts die away and before the cicadas tune up there is nothing but the fluting of the wood thrush as the yellow sunlight goes level between the spokes of the pines . By now the golfers , sweaty and hearty , are in the locker room tinkling ice in glasses of Tanqueray , and Diz Dean briquets are lighting up all over Linwood . Forest time turned back into clock time with time going out ahead of her in a straight line as a measure of her doing something , but she was not doing anything andp238therefore clock time became a waiting and a length which she thought of as a longens . Only in late afternoon did she miss people . She said to the dog : This time of day is a longens . The dog turned his anvil head first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longitude longens ensues in a longing if not an unbelonging . What ? said the dog . One way to escape the longens of clock time marching out into the future ahead of her was to curl away from it , going round and down into her dog-star Sirius serious self so there she was curled up under , not on , the potting table . The dog did not like her there . He whined a little and gave her a poke with his muzzle . Okay okay . She got up . No , it was n't so bad and not bad at all when it got dark and clock time was rounded off by night . She lit a candle and the soft yellow light made a room in the dark and time went singing along with cicada music and not even the screech owl was sad except that just at dusk there rose in her throat not quite panic but somethingrising nevertheless . She swallowed it , all but the aftertasteof wondering : tomorrow will it be worse , even a curse ? But in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it to read by , the dog now waiting for her signal , which is opening the book , hops up he not she spiraling round and down but always ending with his big anvil head aimed at her , eyes open , tiny flame upside down in each pupil , watching her until she starts reading her book : then down comes his head on her knee heavy as iron . She read from The Trail of the LonesomePine : Hand in hand , Hale and June followed the footsteps of spring from the time June met him at the school-house gate for their first walk in the woods . Hale pointed to some boys playing marbles . " That 's the first sign , " he said , and with quick understandingJune smiled . Sign of what ? Spring ?  |p239One  morning she woke and could not quite remember what she was doing in the greenhouse . But she remembered she had written a note to herself in her notebook for just such an occasion . The note read : The reason you are living here is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself . How to live from one moment to the next : Clean the place up . Decide on a profession . Work at it . What about people ? Men ? Do you want ( i ) to live with another person ? ( 2 ) a man ? ( 3 ) a woman ? ( 4 ) no one ? ( 5 ) Do you want to make love with another person ? ( 6 ) " Fall in love " ? ( 7 ) What is " falling in love " ? ( 8 ) Is it part of making love or different ? ( 9 ) Do you wish to marry ? ( io ) None of these ? ( i i ) Are people necessary ? Without people there are no tunneling looks . Brooks do n't look and dogs look away . But late afternoon needs another person . What do I do if people are the problem ? Can I live happily in a world without people ? What if four o'clock comes and I need a person ? What do you do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some reason when she read this note to herself , she thought of an expression she had not heard since grade school : " Doing it . " Was " doing it " the secret of life ? Is this a secret everyone knows but no one talks about ? She " did it " at Nassau with Sarge , the Balfour jewelry salesman , thinking that it might be the secret of life . But even though she and Sarge did everything in the picture book Sarge had , it did not seem to be the secret of life . Had she missed something ? On the days she walked to town she found herself sitting on the bench near The Happy Hiker . One day the marathon runner saw her and sat down on the bench beside her . Again he shook hands with his fibrous monkey hand . Again he asked her to crash with him in the shelter on Sourwood Mountain.  |p240Again  she said no . Again he loped away , white stripes scissoring . Another afternoon a hiker asked for a drink of water at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her on the floor of the little porch . Though he was young and fair as a mountain youth , his face was dusky and drawn with weariness . When he moved , his heavy clothes were as silent as his skin . He smelled , she imagined , like soldier , of sweat and leather gear . They were sitting , knees propped up . His arm lay across his knee , the hand suspended above her knees . She looked at the hand . Tendons crossed the boxy wrist , making ridges and swales . A rope of vein ran along the placket of muscle in the web of the thumb . Copper-colored hair turning gold at the tip sprouted from the clear brown skin . The weight of the big slack hand flexed the wrist , causing the tendon to raise the forefinger like Adam 's hand touching God 's . As she watched , the hand fell off his knee and fell between her knees . She looked at him quickly to see if he had dozed off but he had not . The hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this but perhaps I should . Embarrassed for him , she cleared her throat and rose quickly , but the hand tightened on her thigh and pulled her down . Mainly she was embarrassed for him . Oh , this is too bad . Is something wrong with me ? The dog growled , his eyes turning red as a bull 's . The man thanked her and left . He too seemed embarrassed . Was there something she did not know and needed to be told ? Perhaps it was a matter of " falling in love . " She knew a great deal about pulleys and hoists but nothing about love . She went to the library to look up love as she had looked up the mechanical advantages of pulleys . Surely great writers and great lovers of the past had written things worth reading . Here were some of the things great writers had written : Love begets loveLove conquers all thingsLove ends with hopeLove is a flame to burn out human ills Love is all truthp241Love is truth and truth is beauty Love is blindLove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is love 's reward " Oh my God , " she said aloud in the library and smacked her head . " What does all that mean ? These people are crazier than I am ! " Nowhere could she find a clear explanation of the connectionbetween " being in love " and " doing it . " Was this somethingeverybody knew and so went without saying ? or was it a well-kept secret ? or was it something no one knew ? Was she the only Southern girl who did n't know ? She began to suspect a conspiracy . They , teachers , books , parents , poets , philosophers , psychologists , either did not know what they were talking about , which seemed unlikely , or they were keeping a secret from her . Was something wrong with her ? What did she want ? Was she supposed to want to " do it " ? If she was supposed to , who was doing the supposing ? Was it a matter of " falling in love " ? With whom ? a man ? a woman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her knees . Naargh , she said . The dog cocked an eyebrow . What ? Is one supposed to do such-and-so with another person in order to be happy ? Must one have a plan for the pursuit of happiness ? If so , is there a place where one looks up what one is supposed to do or is there perhaps an agency which one consults ? Who says ? Who is doing the supposing ? Why not live alone if it is people who bother me ? Why not live in a world of books and brooks but no looks ? Going home one evening , she passed Hattie 's Red Barn . Young folk were dancing and drinking and joking . Couples came and went to vans . Someone beckoned to her from the doorway . She did not belong with them . Why not ? They were her age.  |p242They  were making merry , were n't they ? and she would like to make merry , would n't she ? They were good sorts , were n't they ? Yes , but not good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you are away from home . She had a home but it was not yet registered . A registrar was needed to come and register her home in the presence of a third party , a witness . Upon the departure of the registrar the third party would look at her and say : Well , this is your home and here we are . She would make sassafras tea . Then they could make merry . Perhaps she had not sunk deep enough into her Sirius self . If one sinks deep enough there is surely company waiting . Otherwise , if one does not have a home and has not sunk into self , and seeks company , the company is lonesome . Silence takes root , sprouts . Looks dart . On the other hand , look what happens to home if one is too long at home . Rather than go home to Williamsport , she 'd rather live in a stump hole even though her parents ' home was not only registered with the National Registry but restored and written up in Southern Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , she 'd rather join the navy and see the world . Why is a home the best place and also the worst ? How can the best place become the worst place ? What is a home ? A home is a place , any place , any building , where one sinks into one 's self and finds company waiting . Company ? Who 's company ? oneself ? somebody else ? That 's the problem . The problem is not the house . People are the problem . But it was their problem . She could wait . The man watched her from the bunk but she did n't mind . His look was not controlling or impaling but soft and gray and going away . Her back felt his and the dog 's eyes following her , but when she faced them , their eyes rolled up into their eyebrows . The mornings grew cold . It was a pleasure to rise shiveringp243from her own potting-table bunk and kneel at the Grand Crown stove and start a fat-pine fire for its quick blazing warmth and busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark rhododendrons dripped and humped in close , still hiding croquet balls knocked " galley west " in 1890 tournaments . This dreary cold clime is not getting me down ! The first morning the man said : " You gave me a bath . " " Yes . And washed your clothes . " She dropped the clothes on him . " You can put them on . " She was stiff . She had slept with the dog on croker sacks . From the army surplus store she bought two scratchy Italian NATO blankets and made a bed of pine needles on a slatted flat , which she propped on four upended big pots . They talked about the once cool-feeling now warm-feeling cave air blowing above them . He told her how Judge Kemp had saved the cost of kerosene for the greenhouse but think what you could save . Your overhead is zero . ( It made her feel good that her overhead was not over head and pressing down on her but was nought , had gone away . ) You could grow produce all winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell where , she asked . I do n't know , he said , but we can find out  --  is that what you want to do , make a living here ? I do n't know , she said . One morning when she returned from her woods latrine , a comfortable fork in the chestnut fall , which she used and where she deposited his excretions from a Clorox bottle and a neatly folded packet of newspaper , she found him sitting in the doorway in the morning sun . His swellings had gone down except for the knee , the scrapes had dry scabs , and his eyes were all right , not the inturning Khe Sanh white eyes but gray and clear and focused on the dog . His scruffy yellow beard looked odd against his smooth platinum-and-brown hair . Was he nodding because he knew what he was going to do ? He nodded toward the other doorjamb as if it were the chair across his desk . She took it , sat down . " Now , you 've done a great deal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , for fear of upsetting your balance sheet of debits and credits . I know you are particular about owingp244somebody something , but maybe you will learn that 's not so bad . I do n't mind being in your debt . You wo n't mind my saying that I would do the same for you , and take pleasure in it , and furthermore can easily see our positions reversed . What I wish to tell you is that I accept what you 've done for me and that I have other things to ask of you . I do n't mind asking you . There are things that need to be done and only you can do them . Will you ? " " I will , " she said . I will , she thought , because now he knew exactly what had to be done just as she had known what to do when he lay knocked out on her floor . I 'd do anything he asks me , she thought , hoist anything . Why is that ? " Do you have a calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . He looked at it , looked up at her , smiled . ( Smiled ! ) " Wrong year . " She shrugged . She was afraid to ask what year it was . " What is today ? " " The fifteenth . " " Hm . It seems I 've been gone two weeks . " His gray eyesmet hers . She did n't mind . " How much money do you have ? " " One hundred and eleven dollars and thirty-one cents . " " What are you going to do when your money runs out ? " She shrugged . " Find employment . " " Doing what ? " " Hoisting maybe . Also gardening . " " Hoisting ? Hoisting what ? " " Anything . " " I see . You would n't consider my paying you something , or lending , until you get paid for your ah hoisting . " " How much money do you have ? " she asked . " On me ? " " On you and off you . " " About fifty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enough to employ you . " " No , that would throw things off-balance and render my Sirius unserious . " " Why should n't I pay for my room and board ? " he asked her.  | " To give one reason if not others , you do n't have a dime . I had to go through your pockets before washing your clothes . " He laughed then winced and put a hand to his side . " I can get some . " " When you do , there will be time for a consideration of remuneration . The only thing in your pockets was a slip of paper which said Help ! With tiger , fifty feet above . I was wondering about the nature of the tiger you were over and above . " " It does n't matter . Could you do the following things for me in town . Do you have pencil and paper ? " She opened her notebook . " Go to Western Union , which is at the bus station , and send the following telegram to Dr. Sutter Vaught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Send this message : Plans changed . Forget about letter . Read it if you like but tear it up . Do n't act on it . Will write . Barrett . Send it straight message . " " Straight message , " she repeated , hoping he would explain but he did n't . Probably he meant send it straight to Albuquerqueand not roundabout by way of Chicago . " Is that all ? " " No . Go to Dr. Vance Battle 's office . See him alone . Tell him I want to see him . Tell him where I am , tell him I want to see him today and ask him not to tell anybody or bring anybody with him . " " Anything else ? " " Go by the library and get a book on hydroponic garden-ing . " " Okay . " " Then go behind the bus station and see if my car is still there . A silver Mercedes 450 SEL . My keys are under the seat . Drive it to the country-club parking lot . Park at the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . " She swallowed . Very well . Drive a car ? His car ? Very well . If he asked her to drive the car , she could drive the car . " Okay . Why were you in the cave ? " " What ? Oh . " Now he was walking up and down the greenhousenot limping badly , shouldering , hands in pockets . Does he notice how clean and smooth the concrete is ? She felt the floor with both hands ; it was cool and iron-colored and silky as McWhorter 's driveway . She wished he would notice her con/crete , the best-cured concrete in North Carolina . " I go down in caves sometimes , " she said . He told her about the tiger . " But the tiger was n't there . " " No . " " Then  --  ? " " Then what ? " " Then there was more than the tiger ? " " Yes . " " You were trying to find out something besides the tiger . " " Yes . " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to find a yesor-noanswer . " " Did you find the answer ? " " Yes . " " Which was it ? " " I do n't know . " " So you came back up and out . " " Yes , I came hack up and out . " " Is that good ? " " Good ? " He shrugged . " I do n't know . At least I know what I have to do . Do n't worry . " " About what ? " " About money . I 'll pay you back . " " I do n't worry about money . Money worry is not instigat-ing . " " No , it 's not . You 'd better go . " She enjoyed her errands . Straight to the bus station , where she found the silver Mercedes . Though she wanted to try the keys and practice starting the car , she decided not to . Someone might see her . She would do her errands , wait until dark , and drive to the country club . Nobody saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this what people in the world do ? This is called " joining the work force . " It is not a had way to live . One gets a job . There is a task and a task teller ( a person who tells you a task ) , a set of directions , instructions , perhaps a map , a carrying out of thep247task , a finishing of the task , a return to the task teller to report success , a thanking . A getting paid . An assignment of another task . She clapped her hands for joy . What a discovery ! To get a job , do it well , which is a pleasure , please the employer , which is also a pleasure , and get paid , which is yet another pleasure . What a happy life employees have ! How happy it must make them to do their jobs well and please their employers ! That was the secret ! All this time she had made a mistake . She had thought ( and her mother had expected ) that she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick lay in leading the most ordinary life imaginable , get an ordinary job , in itself a joy in its very ordinariness , and then be as extraordinary or ordinary as one pleased . That was the secret . On to Western Union , which was part of the Greyhound bus station . As she wrote the message she tried not to make sense of it . The telegram cost $7.89 . When the clerk read the message , she said to him casually but with authority : " Straight message , please ! " " Right , " said the clerk , not raising his eyes . Victory ! She had made it in the world ! Not only could she make herself understood . People even understood what she said when she did n't . It was a pleasure spending her money for him . Why ? she wondered . Ordinarily she hoarded her pennies , ate dandelionand-docksalad . She sat on her bench but in a new way . The buildings and the stores were the same but more accessible . She might have business in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparklingin the sun . A cardboard sign in the window announced a concert by Le Hug , a rock group . What a pleasure to have a job ! Smiling , she hugged herself and rocked in the sun . Imagine getting paid for a task by the task teller ! Money wherewith to live ! And live a life so , years , decades ! So that was the system . Quel system ! A real townie she felt like now , bustling past slack-jawed hippies , moony-eyed tourists , blue-haired lady leafers , antiquers , and quilt collectors.  |p248When  she went into a building , the dog stayed on the sidewalkpaying no attention to anyone until she came out . He showed his pleasure not by wagging his tail but by burying his heavy anvil head in her stomach until his eyes were covered . There was no way to see Dr. Battle except to sign a clipboardand wait her turn as a patient . She had to wait two hours . She liked him , though he was too busy and groggy from overwork and thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fond dazed rush , not listening , eyes straying over her , coming close ( was he smellingher ? ) . His hand absently palpated her shoulder , queried the bones , tested the ball joint for its fit and play . Unlike Dr. Duk he did n't bother to listen , or rather he listened not to your words but your music . He was like a vet , who does n't have to listen to his patients . There were other ways of getting at you . He saw so many patients that it was possible for him to have a hunch about you , a good country hunch , the moment you walked in the door . Better still , it was possible for her to subside and see herself through his eyes , so canny and unheeding , sleepy and quick , were they . Well then , how did she look to him ? Is my shoulder human ? He cocked an ear for her music . The fond eyes cast about to place her , then placed her . She was classifiable then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of a class and recognizableas such . I belong here ! He looked at her boots . " You just off the trail ? " " Well no , though I 've been walking quite a bit . " " And you 're feeling a little spacy . " " A little what ? " " Spaced out . " " What 's that ? " " Are you on something or coming off something ? " " What ? " He did n't seem impatient with her dumbness . " Okay , " he said , counting off the questions on his fingers . " Are you taking a drug ? Are you taking the pill ? Are you coming off the pill ? Are you pregnant ? " " No to one and all . " How would he treat her madness ?  |p249ignore  it , palpate her shoulder and tell her to lead her life ? Would she ? " Okay , what 's the trouble , little lady ? " " I 'm fine . What I was trying to tell you was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " "  --  was to give you a message from  --  " She wanted to say " from him . " What to call him ? Mr. Barrett ? Mr. Will ? Will Barrett ? Bill Barrett ? Williston Bibb Barrett ? None of the names fit . A name would give him form once and for all . He would flow into its syllables and junctures and there take shape forever . She did n't want him named . Sluggishly , like a boat righting itself in a heavy sea , Dr. Battle was coming round to her . He began to listen . " From who ? " " Your friend Barrett , " she mumbled . The surname was neutral , the way an Englishman speaks of other Englishmen . " Who ? Will Barrett ? Will Barrett 's out of town , " he said as if he were answering her questions . " Yes . " This time his eyes snapped open , click . " What about Will Barrett ? " " You are to come see him this afternoon when you finish here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rascal sick ? " Rascal . The word had peculiar radiations but mainly fondness . " No . That is , I think he is all right now . He is scratched up and bruised and his leg is hurt but he can walk . This is in confidence . He does n't want anyone to know about this message . " It was a pleasure to talk to another person about him . " In confidence ? " For a second the eye went cold and flashed like a beacon . " I have not kidnapped him , " she said . He laughed . " All right . Where is he ? " " He is at my  --  " My what ? "  --  place . " " Oh . So . " He cocked his head and regarded her . It was possible for her to go around behind his eyes and see her and Will at her place . " Well , I 'll be dog . How about that ? Okay . What 's with Will ? Has he got his tail in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
