THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment Y showing how much they can actually hold and still allow room , the full summer streets seem much larger than the bare winter ones . Weather permitting , the people of the East Village and the neighbor hoods around it like to come out on the street and lounge and bicker in the open air . They gather in groups , some times of one sex , sometimes of both , and match the volume of their voices to the radios they carry . They are total ly frank and not at all self-conscious in discussing the character of someone 's sister 's boyfriend ( who is related to the super , who is no good ) or assess ing the appearance of a new arrival on the corner . One group respects an other 's privacy , and only the largest disputes attract any attention . We like to wander among these exchanges . The people look friendly  --  even during disagreements the tone of their voices is almost always good-natured  --  and we often wish we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces . They try to fix cars by com mittee . They open bottles of beer or soda and toss the bottle caps into the street , and the tires on the cars coming by press them into the hot tar , so the whole street looks like part of an urban abstract mosaic or like a sprawling and intricate connect-the-dots drawing . The groups swell and spill into the street and block traffic , and a person in an otherwise nondescript car sounds an air horn that plays the opening phrase of " La Cucaracha " or " Dixie " or a salsa tune to clear them out of the way . In moments of relative quiet , we hear bits of conversation . Two men talk at cross-purposes . One says , " How 're you doing ? " The other says , " Not bad . I was thinking of moving uptown . " " My wife 's just out of the hospital , " says the first . " Little place up on Eighty-sixth Street , " says the second . And so on . A boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I had n't popped that balloon . I miss it now . " ? n Out and Back HEIGHTS-/NWOOD is the name of a weekly newspaper that is read mainly by those Manhattan residents who live closest to the Arctic Circle . It is a genuine community newspaper . According to the editors , life may exist south of the George Washington Bridge , but you 'll have to look else  --  where to read about it in detail . Heights-Inwood offers provocative headlines ( " CAR IN 5-STORY GARAGE PLUNGE , " " KIDS MESS UP IND " ) , soft news ( " DONEMAY PUB PLANS 4TH OF JULY BLAST " ) , service fea  --  tures ( " A Sure-Fire Way to Make Your Beer Taste Better " ) , and " Up  --  town 011ie , " a cartoon strip whose main character owns a pet pal-rot named Broadway . The paper has been in business for seven and a half years , and we have read it regularly during that time . No other sheet in town car  --  ries ads for the Fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , it came as an un  --  pleasant surprise when an issue arrived one day not long ago bearing a front-page editorial titled " Our Final Issue . " Heights-Inwood , it seemed , faced the same dilemma as the Chrysler Cor poration  --  too much outflow , inade  --  quate income . We scanned the final issue ? " FELTmAN HEADS 34TH PRE CINCT , " " 2 ' RUB OUT ' A 3RD IN BEN-NETT AVE . MURDER , " " STATE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS WE TAKE OUR LEAVE " and thought , That 's that ; too bad . The following week , however , another issue of Hdghts-In wood arrived in the mail . The front-page headline exclaimed , in seventy  --  four-point type , " WE 'RE BACK  --  TO STAY ! " This was sufficiently dramatic to get us to take an A train to Inwood a few days later to find out what had happened . We rode to 200th Street and emerged aboveground in that part of Manhattan which strongly resembles Flarbush or Park Slope .. We walked down Broadway a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Barry Dunleavey , the paper 's pub  --  lisher and editor . He invited us to walk across Broadway to a bench on the edge of Fort Tryon Park . The bench apparently functions as an annex to the Heights-Inwood office . The main office , which occupies a storefront , is the antithesis of spacious . It is approxi  --  mately large enough to park a car in . In fact , someone tried to do just that one day last winter . This was a read  --  er who , rather belatedly , expressed his objection to some attention that he had received in the paper 's " Police Re  --  port " column two years earlier . The miscreant backed a four-door sedan through the plate-glass front window . This displaced the reception area , mov  --  ing it into the newsroom , and exacer  --  bated the office 's space shortage . The car has been removed , but the store  --  front has been covered with plywood ever since . Mr. Dunleavey , a slim , handsome , gray-haired man in his forties , ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quick  --  ly . " The day we published our final issue , I went around and said good  --  bye to some of our most loyal ad  --  vertisers , " he said . " I went to see Har  --  ry Birnbaum , of Ronjenn Shoes , on Dyckman Street , and Harry at the In  --  wood Shell Service Station , and Mr. Flynn at the local Chemical Bank branch , Not much else happened that day . In a way , it was sad , I suppose . But in another way I felt relieved . The next morning , I was in the office at ten o'clock and the phone rang . It was a local businessman calling to ask whether I could come to a meeting of some of the businessmen of the com  --  community an hour later . I went to the meeting , and the gist of what they had to say was that they felt the paper was important enough to the community so that it should be saved . So the day after we went out of business we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a profes  --  sional actor before he became a news  --  paper publisher , declined to emphasize one irony  --  that the community busi  --  nessmen who came to the paper 's res  --  cue did so largely because Heights-Inwood had identified , and confirmed the importance of , the community 's ex  --  istence in the first place . Being back in business means that a couple of recently launched promotional campaigns for the newspaper  --  Bermuda Sweepstakes and the Community Awards Celebra  --  tion wo n't have to he cancelled . Things are still not all straightforward and simple , however . The businessmen who have offered to support Heights-Inwood have an option to buy it . Now they have announced their intention of exercising this option , but they have found themselves disagreeing with Mr. Dunleavey over the terms of the sale . " If this were to fall through , we would hope that something else could be worked out , because we would hate to have to publish another final issue , " Mr. Dunleavey said as we sat on the park bench and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other day , while the discussion of terms presumably continued , another issue of Heights-Inwood arrived in the mail . It contained a front-page advice column headed " How to Get a Subsi  --  dized Apartment , " some unsettling crime news ( " FIND STABBED CORPSE SEATED UPRIGHT ON FLOOR " ) , and an interview with the ninety-one-year  --  old sister-in-law of Harry Houdini , the great escape artist . Her name is Marie Hinson , she lives in Washington Heights , and , while you may have read it here first , we did n't . Audition TESTER ER LA NIN , the society bandlead er , who is from Philadelphia , who as a child played the piano and the drums , who has played at more than ten thousand weddings and at more than three thousand debutante parties , who has played in every state of the union except Montana , who has com  --  mitted to memory the tunes of many thousands of songs , who is in his sixties , who has been conducting a Lester Lanin Orchestra since 1937 , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , held an open au ? dition recently in a room he rented for four hours in a building on Broadway . Sixty-three musicians showed up for the audition . They had heard about it either from the musicians ' - union paper or from a column in the Post or by word of mouth . Of the sixty-three mu  --  sicians who showed up , five were wom  --  en , one of whom played the flute , one the trumpet , one the harp , and the two others  --  sisters , who had just come from playing on the QE2 eighty-day 1980 World Cruise  --  the violin and the accordion . It was raining heavily on the day Lester Lanin held the audition , and al  --  most everybody in the studio a large , white , square room with mirrors cov  --  ering one wall looked a little rumpled and damp , the way people look when they have just come in out of the rain . Lester Lanin did not look rumpled and damp . lie wore a neatly tailored black suit with a vest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and-white patterned tie . He is a small man , about five feet seven , and he stood more or less in the center of the room , surrounded by auditioning mu  --  sicians  --  say , a pianist , a drummer , a bass player , a clarinettist , a trumpet player , a trombonist , a flutist , and a guitarist . Every fifteen minutes or so , a new group of musicians assembled . Each musician was asked to play some  --  thing , and the others joined in . " Do you know " Swonderfu/ ' ? " Les  --  ter Lanin asked a man who played the trum  --  pet . " Yes , " said the man . He started playing " ' Swonderful , " and the other musicians did their best to join him . " That 's good , " said Lester Lanin . " But a couple of notes were a little corny . Try ' Somebody Loves Me. ' 7 , Altogether , in a period of four hours , Lester Lanin asked thirty musicians to play " Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Things You Are , " thirty-five musicians to play " ' Swonderful , " twenty-seven musi  --  cians to play " Willow Weep for Me , " forty-two musicians to play THE NEW YORKER " Muskrat Ramble , " one musician to play " Proud Mary , " three musicians to play " Bad Girl , " the same three musicians to play " Hot Stuff , " four musicians to play " Macho Man , " one musician to play " Freak Out , " ten mu  --  sicians to play " Hello , Dolly ! , " one musician to play " Ease On Down the Road , " two musicians to play " Just the Way You Are , " and one musician to play " Moonlight Be  --  comes You . " When any of the musicians did n't know the tunes to the songs , Lester Lanin told them to go out and buy a certain songbook , which had over five hundred songs in it , and learn all the songs in the book . He told them that in his orchestras , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one played from sheet music  --  only from memory . To a man who was a very good trombone play  --  er but knew only one of the tunes he was asked to play , Lester Lanin said , " Many famous orchestra musicians have played with me , but they were n't qualified to play a deb party or other social event , because they could n't play the tunes without charts . " At the end of the audition , Lester Lanin said he thought he would use men who had played the clarinet , the flute , the guitar , and the trombone , and the two sisters who had just come off the ( 2E2 tour . Copies AFRIEND visiting France has sent us this report : Pati Hill is an American whose present ambition is , in her words , to photocopy Versailles . Born in Kentucky and raised in Virginia , Miss Hill was a fashion model in Paris in the early fifties , since when she has written poems , stories , and novels , invented a modern hieroglyphic language , and been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now living in Paris again , with her husband  --  a French  --  man named Paul Bianchini  --  and has a two-room office , reeking of photo  --  copying chemicals , on a side street off the square called the Madeleine . For the past five years , she has been using photocopiers to reproduce all sorts of likely and unlikely objects , and some of this work has been exhibited in New York and is being exhibited right now at the Pompidou Center , in Paris . Other artists , too , are currently work  --  ing with copying machines , fascinated by a process that can take an utterly ordinary thing and dissociate it from the context in which we normally see it , thereby making it particular and sometimes magical again  --  an effect , it seems , of the shallow yet dramatic depth perception of photocopiers , which give the copied object the effect of floating in space . " For me , it started one day in Stonington when I was cleaning out a drawer , " says Miss Hill , who has a gamin air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most of it was stuff I was going to throw away , but I decided I wanted to remember some things , like buttons and gloves , so I took them over to New London and got the copying service to copy them for me . Pretty soon , I was working their machine myself . I copied bars of soap , zippers , fruit , a light bulb , swan feathers , and parts of old clothes --  underwear and linen dresses . I began to experiment with the machine , and I learned that just after a new supply of toner had been put in , you could get a really deep black from it . Jill Kornblee gave me the first of several shows I 've had at her gallery , on Fifty-seventh Street , in New York , but the New London people thought I was n't doing their machine much good , so I ap  --  proached I.B.M . They were n't very interested . But I had a friend whose husband worked for them , and one Friday afternoon he invited me into I.B.M . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own all weekend . I took some cheese sandwiches and apples and worked the drink-dispensing machines . I ran into a cleaning woman , who asked was I from upstairs , and I re  --  plied , ' More or less . ' Anyway , I got a lot of copies made , and walked out on Monday morning when everyone came in . " Not long afterward , Miss Hill sat next to the late Charles Eames , the de  --  signer , on a flight from Paris to New York , and she showed him some of her work . As a result , he formally in  --  troduced her to I.B.M. , which gave her a grant and lent her a machine for two and a half years . Right now , she has a Rank Xerox 2600 . She says , " On the small range of machines I 've worked with , the differences are that I.B.M . is grainier and seems to offer me a greater range of tones and great  --  er depth perception . Xerox prints a more photographically realistic copy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of any suitable pa  --  per . You can spray the black afterward with fixative to intensify the tone . " Miss Hill has achieved some of her effects by moving the object around as the copy is being made ; by once in a while using blue , yellow , or green pa  --  per ; and by spooning in extra quanti  --  ties of toner ( tiny black pat-rides that are attracted to the paper electrostatically and arc bonded to it by heat ) , thus cre  --  ating various profundities of dark . Her present machine takes about five min  --  utes to warm up in the morning , and when Miss Hill is in full swing she may press the button as many as fifty times in an hour  --  a figure that is registered , like car mileage , and is added to the cost of the machine . " A copier works like a magnet , attracting or rejecting things , " she says . " It separates things , gives them an edge . On the grays , it 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward black or toward white . A photocopy seems to me much more truthful to detail than a photo  --  graph . On a copier , the actualities of something become quite marvellous . Everything is symbolic . This makes it difficult when it comes to giving a copy as a present  --  people think the reason you have given it to them is connected with whatever it is you 've copied . A copier also allows you to go on and on making copies without limit . You can put copies together like a mosaic  --  for  --  ever , if you want to . And copy subjects are not necessarily right side up . The very image of space ! In a way , of course , you 're working with accidents . You do n't see the side of the object that is being copied  --  that side is sud  --  denly illuminated , as though struck by ligh tning . " And why Versailles ? Why this vast , extremely formal palace , which Louis XIV , the Sun King , held court in and extended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pati Hill says she has various reasons . " One is that I admire the splendid style of Versailles  --  the fact that it expresses Louis 's statement L'tat , c'est moi . ' It 's both a very self-centered and a very public-spirited place . Secondly , there 's the American connection . Ben Franklin was there . John D. Rocke  --  feller and other Americans have given oodles to help restore it . I wanted to do a hi-national project , French and American , since that 's how I feel right now . And I wanted to do something big  --  something that could be done only by an industrial machine with the help of people in industry . I wanted to see what the copier , a modern device , would make of something old . I want  --  ed to show how many of Versailles 's possessions , which had been dispersed , are now being brought together again , and to show its elegance again by copy  --  ing many small things in it . When I remember places I have been , I mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exciting to do that remembering with a copier  --  which , with its eye-accurate view of details and its human-vision-sized pictures , would report back something like what human beings see when they visit a place , whose parts are linked princi  --  pally by the fact that people know they are finked . I will do details . I want to copy a cobblestone , parts of espaliered trees , anti-damp grilles , graffiti , lollipop sticks , the embroidery on Marie Antoinette 's bedspreads and draperies , and the King 's left foot from the equestrian statue in the front yard . I know that all this will mean lugging a photocopying machine around and propping it up in all sorts of strange ways , but that does n't scare me . I would like to copy the key to the main gate , but I do n't think they 'll let me . I want to display the copies in picture-mounting card , one recessed rectangle next to another  --  something like the tall windows of Versailles . Gerald van der Kemp , who has just retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailles , was a bit puzzled when I first proposed the project to him , so I sent him some copies I 'd done of flowers . He said they were fierique  --  fairylike . I think Louis Quatorze would have had Versailles filled with photocopiers . " Miss Hill believes that for the mo  --  ment  --  which , technology being what it is , may not last long  --  the photo  --  copier is one of the most powerful in  --  struments for self-expression around . She says , " Photocopiers enable every person in every office to be an artist -- though I know that when I say that sort of thing it troubles I.B.M , and Xerox . They can visualize all the prob  --  lems that will result from art and ex  --  periment  --  the burnups and paper jams , and copier repairmen submitting huge bills , I think it 's wonderful that there are copy places like laundromats , where artists can go and use the machines for not much money . Copiers bring artists and writers together . Copies are an in  --  ternational visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Prague the same way . Making copies is very near to speaking . " Ai the Brass Moon Cafe MIC HAEL CUM M s , One of the proprietors of the Brass Moon Cafe , on Duane Street , and its prin  --  principal builder , told us a story during the crowded opening party for his bar-res  --  taurant on a recent evening : " I love joints . I love bars of all lcinds . One of my favorite bars is the White Horse , in the Village When I was sixteen , I used to sneak into Man  --  hattan from Queens and drink there . The owner was this Dutch guy who lived upstairs , and when he sold the place to two of his bartenders he can  --  celled everybody 's tab , including mine . What a gentleman . Made me feel real  --  ly grown-up , having a bar tab and then having it cancelled . So when I went to work , the first place I tended bar was the White Horse " " Excuse me , Michael , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it from ? " " That 's a pressed-tin ceiling , and it comes from one of the last places in the city to do that kind of ceiling  --  Stan  --  dard Tinsmith , on Chrystie Street . They coat the tin to keep it frorn rust  --  ing . I had to wash it with vinegar be  --  fore I put it up . " Anyway , I was working in the White Horse  --  I was filling in for somebody on one of my days off , ac  --  tually  --  and I came back to my apart  --  ment and I had been totally cleaned out . They stole my stereo , my televi  --  sion , a lot of other stuff , and  --  the worst thing  --  they got my guitar , which was a gift to me from a friend , and which had once belonged to Mis  --  sissippi John Hurt . Irreplaceable gui  --  tar . So ? " " Excuse me , Michael . That girl is chaining her bicycle to your sandwich board . Is that O.K. ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go back into the White Horse , and I 'm sitting there drinking , trying to forget ? " " Michael ! Incredible panelling ! Who did it ? " " All the architectural woodwork was done by Bob Biondi . That panel  --  ling we bought at the exotic-wood store on Park Avenue South . It 's an esoteric African mahogany called pomele . ? Anyway , I 'm sitting there having a few drinks , I 'm real depressed , and this guy sitting next to me at the bar notices I 'm depressed , and he asks me ? " " Excuse me , Mike , are we ready for the chicken now ? " " This is my chef de cuisine , Larry Liptak , a twenty-five-year-old genius , from the Culinary Institute of Amer  --  ica . He trained with Andre Rena , the great French chef at the Hotel Pierre . Sure , start the chicken . " So the guy asks me what 's wrong , and I tell him I got ripped off , and he asks me what l lost ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  self ? " " That 's all real one-inch white hex  --  agonal glazed-clay tile , and I did it all myself . " So he asks me what I lost , and tell him , and he says wait here , and about twenty minutes later he comes back with all my stuff ! He said my television was already gone , but he of  --  fered to get me another one ? " " Michael , the man from the insur ance company is here about your em  --  ployee coverage . " " Give him a drink . talk to him in a second . " So he gives me back my stuff , and he says , ' Man , I 'm really sorry , I did n't know that was your apartment . ' He told me , ' You should 've put your name on your window . ' I had one win  --  dow , it looked out on a shaftway , and the guy tells me I should 've put my name on it . " " Michael , can I talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
