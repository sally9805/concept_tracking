A former ship ' s officer of Exxon Shipping Co. says in a complaint and deposition that he told the company at least four years ago that the skipper of the ill-fated oil tanker Exxon Valdez had a drinking problem but that he failed to get any company response . Captain Joseph Hazelwood was in command when the tanker was impaled on an Alaskan reef , creating the biggest oil spill in North American history . Tests run on Capt . Hazelwood by the Coast Guard nine hours after the Exxon Valdez slammed into a reef in Prince William Sound indicated that he was drunk at the time of the accident . In a lengthy deposition filed in New York State Supreme Court in New York City , former second mate Bruce Amero alleges that he saw Capt . Hazelwood leave the bridge and go below to drink as another oil tanker , on which both were serving , was leaving Alaska ' s Valdez Harbor during a trip in the early 1980s . Mr. Amero testified he complained to the shipping unit of Exxon Corp. in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazelwood ' s behavior . But , he said in the two-part deposition , he failed to get any response . Mr. Amero ' s suit , filed in 1987 , alleges that " abuse and harassment " by Capt . Hazelwood caused him to suffer a " post-traumatic stress disorder . " Mr. Amero is seeking nearly $2. 1 million in damages from Exxon and Exxon Shipping . Mr. Amero ' s attorney , Paul C. Matthews , said that Mr. Amero had a nervous breakdown that can be attributed to the abuse he took from Capt . Hazelwood . Mr. Amero no longer works for Exxon , but has been collecting disability payments from the oil company . An attorney representing Mr. Hazelwood was unavailable for comment . Neither the complaint nor the deposition proves that there was any wrongdoing on the part of Exxon or Capt . Hazelwood . But the documents allege that the captain ' s abuse of alcohol was well-known within the Exxon fleet in the early 1980s . The actions attributed to Capt . Hazelwood in the legal papers , however , occurred prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After participating in the rehabilitation program , he was eventually returned to duty . Top Exxon executives have since publicly stated that shouldn ' t have been done . Asked yesterday what follow-up it conducted on Capt . Hazelwood after he returned to duty , Exxon declined to comment . The New York-based oil company also declined to say if it was aware of any other allegations about the captain ' s behavior either before or after his rehabilitation . It also wouldn ' t comment on Mr. Amero ' s suit . " We ' re not commenting on anything related to Capt . Hazelwood , " an Exxon spokesman said . " The case is still open and we ' re not saying anything about it . " Mr. Amero ' s deposition is rather sketchy about the abuse he allegedly suffered at Capt . Hazelwood ' s hands . At no point during questioning was he able to say that the captain verbally or physically abused him . Rather , much of the information he received about the captain ' s dislike for him appears to have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amero , who graduated eighth in his class from the Maine Maritime Academy and now lives in New Hampshire , paints a picture of questionable work practices and the habitual abuse of alcohol by Capt . Hazelwood and some of his officers . In the most striking testimony given 18 months ago , long before the Exxon Valdez accident , Mr. Amero described a scene eerily like the one that allegedly occurred last month before the Exxon Valdez crashed onto Bligh Reef . As the Exxon Baton Rouge , on which both the captain and Mr. Amero were serving in the early 1980s , was " leaving Valdez he ( Capt . Hazelwood ) went below to his room for a drink and left the third mate to navigate the ship out . . . I stayed on the bridge and conned ( oversaw ) the vessel . He went below and had a drink , " Mr. Amero said . When asked how he knew the captain had been drinking , Mr. Amero replied , " He smelled of it when he came up . I didn ' t see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol and appeared to be somewhat intoxicated . " Elsewhere in the deposition , Mr. Amero said that at one point " Hazelwood himself told me that . . . ( an Exxon ) fleet manager . . . had counseled him to stop drinking . " Mr. Amero characterized the counseling as a " warning " rather than " psychological counseling . " He says that conversation took place while he worked with Capt . Hazelwood on board the Exxon Baton Rouge in 1982 . Mr. Amero also claimed to have seen Capt . Hazelwood throw empty Jack Daniels whisky bottles overboard and charged that the captain had drinking parties in his quarters every weekend while at sea . " And there was an incident where I had done some chart work and Hazelwood wanted to review it , so I brought it down to his room and . . . Hazelwood and a couple of other people were in there drinking and I saw Hazelwood drinking at that time , " Mr. Amero said in his deposition . Drinking aboard ship is forbidden by Exxon policy . Mr. Amero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fog , Captain Hazelwood " walked out onto the bridge ( of the tanker ) when we had a course change coming up and he forgot about it . " Mr. Amero said he made the course change , but the captain was supposed to be on the bridge when a course change is made . Fire and boat drills , which were supposed to occur once a week , were held infrequently , Mr. Amero alleged in the documents . False entries were customarily written into the ship ' s log to cover up the missed drills , he said . The former second mate also described an unusual incident in which , he said , Capt . Hazelwood ordered all electronic navigation equipment shut off and told the officers they should use celestial navigation . Mr. Amero says he thought the order inappropriate because it was an overcast night and no stars could be seen , making celestial navigation all but impossible . Mr. Amero said in the court papers that when he came on watch , he turned the electronic equipment back on . After his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amero said , he sought counsel from a friend , Exxon Capt . John Speyer . Capt . Speyer told Mr. Amero that " he had heard that Hazelwood drinks on board the vessel , " but suggested to Mr. Amero that he " just walk away from it , " according to the deposition . Mr. Amero later served again under Capt . Hazelwood . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
