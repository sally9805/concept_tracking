RESEARCH By Max Apple In that crazy spring when the Dow broke 1800 , the physics group was fully invested . It was a good time to be in Los Alamos . Henry Wu had called everyone together in November and predicted the coming bull market . He said he was not interested in averages  --  they were only a sidebar to his comprehensive theory of exchange . In November not everyone believed Henry Wu , but by January we were convinced . The physics group forgot that Wu was just a computer operator who worked for Lazio . Everyone put his savings and his grant money into the market . Every time the Dow spiked , the noise from the conference room sounded like a football cheering section . Wu had wired the Cray supercomputer to a forty-five-inch TV , the kind used to show sports in hotel lobbies . The Cray could play games around the stock market ticker tape . It added current trading on all the world 's markets . It was on-line for every commodity . If you wanted to know the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for you in local currency in a microsecond . He flashed the moving averages every fifteen minutes . His yield curves popped like black holes . Lazio , our Nobel Prize  --  winner , sat in his leather armchair with a bucket of fried chicken beside him , watching his prot  --  g ? . Lazio was the Max Apple 's novel The Propheteers will be published by Harper &; Row/Perennial Library in February . only one who stayed out of the rally . He said he had put all his Nobel money into H. J. Heinz seven years ago and never regretted it . He said Heinz owned Weight Watchers and he believed that staying slim was the only big project still available to the developed world . He said that he was too old to care about growth stocks and Third World investments . Nobody paid any attention to Lazio . He did n't do any research . He was at Los Alamos only because the Joint Chiefs insisted . Every year he went to Washington to testify for greater defense expenditures . His Nobel Prize had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged everyone . If he could win the Nobel Prize , we thought , anyone could do it . We were all used to Lazio sitting in his chair , munching on chicken , while someone gave a paper . Lazio ate fried chicken the way other people smoke cigarettes . He liked to keep a piece on a napkin and nibble during meetings . He left a trail of crumbs everywhere . Nobody else would sit in his leather chair . The maid told him she was going to stop cleaning the chair , but it did n't make any difference to Lazio . Yesterday , when my wife told me she was falling in love with Henry Wu , I blamed Lazio . My first thought was not to kill Henry Wu , but to kill Lazio . Why had he hired a computer operator when he had no work for the man to do ? Why did he give a refugee a $50 million Cray and twenty-four hours a day to play the stock market ? Wu himself said only America could afford to do such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hair for one afternoon with the Cray . Here , I get it all the time , free . " When I knew the truth I went to Lazlo 's office . But neither he nor Wu was there . Vera , the cleaning lady , said they had gone out for a drive . She laughed . As I walked down the corridor I heard two proton-beam technicians discussing July options . By the time I got back to my office I had stopped blaming Lazio . Anyway , Henry Wu in our midst was as much my fault as Lazio 's . Last July I drove Lazio to Albuquerque to pick up Wu at the airport . His plane , scheduled for 9 P.M. , arrived three hours late . While we waited Lazio sat in an airport chair pumping quarters into a TV . When Wu got off the plane he kissed Lazlo 's hand and called him a great man . Lazio told Wu that now that he was in the American Southwest , he did n't have to be humble . He could forget Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took us to the airport snack bar and attempted to pay for three coffees with his American Express card . From Lazlo 's description , I thought Wu would be arriving straight from China , but it turned out he had lived in Guam for two years and then in Hawaii for four years . Although he dreamed of research , his job in Hawaii had been selling computers at Sears . Henry Wu answered Lazlo 's ad in Scientific American . He was slender and tan , even around his eyes . It was not possible to guess his age . When we got to the car , Lazio asked Henry Wu if he had a valid driver 's license . Wu opened his briefcase and brought out a leather-covered document . It was full of stamps , like a passport . There was no photograph , and all the writing was in Chinese . " How do I know this is a valid license ? " Lazio said . " How do I know it 's even a driver 's license . Wu picked it up and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I advertised for a computer operator with a valid driver 's license and you wrote that you had one . " " You did n't specify country , " Wu said . At that moment I chose to be decent . Had I stayed out of it , Lazio might have bought him a ticket right there and sent him back to Hawaii . It was clear that Lazio wanted a chauffeur , not a computer assistant . Lazio had probably been plotting a way to afford a chauffeur for years . Calling Wu a computer assistant was clever . I did n't think Lazio had that much cleverness left . Lazio owns a 1959 Buick that he starts now and then . He likes to talk about cars . In the physics lounge , Lazio but-tonholes people with questions about horsepower and torque and fuel injection , but he is afraid to drive his own car . He admits it . " I ca n't relax when I drive , " he says , " but if someone else is at the wheel , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero to sixty . l am an auto enthusiast , but only as a passenger . " At quarter past midnight in the parking lot at the Albuquerque airport I looked at the Chinese document , flipped through it like a deck of cards , and then gave my keys to Henry Wu . " It looks good to me , " I said . Lazio and I got into the back and buckled up . Henry Wu bowed to thank me . Then he pulled on a pair of kidskin driving gloves . Lazio poked me in the ribs and winked . Wu started the car and stayed in first gear all along the feeder road . I did n't want to embarrass him by saying anything . I was n't sure he even knew about gears . When he hit 1-25 he went up to fifty-five and put the Honda into overdrive . Lazio handed Wu directions and flashed a thumbs-up sign . On the highway both Lazlo and I fell asleep . For me it was unusual , but Lazio always falls asleep . Whenever you look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tired because I had been up for two consecutive nights , bombarding my sample with high-energy particles . I had to be there to monitor the readings , but sometimes there were three- or four-hour stretches with nothing to do . I volunteered to take Lazio to the airport because he asked me when I knew I had a few hours to kill . Henry Wu woke both of us by using the horn . When we opened our eyes , he demonstrated parallel parking in front of the particle accelerator building . " Very good , " Lazio said . " I 'm sure you 'll be a fine assistant . " " I have high technical competence , " Henry Wu said . " The Cultural Revolution ruined me . Always , I belonged at Bell Labs or at Princeton . Instead they made me a silk farmer . " That was the only time I ever heard Wu say anything about the way he had been treated or what he had done in China . He was a patriotic American , as most naturalized citizens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Alamos but he chose not to destroy Wall Street . If I had n't let him drive my Honda that night , he might he in Hawaii now selling portable computers to children . But I know the truth and the truth is , I ca n't blame Lazio or myself . Emily did not have to fall in love with Wu . I still do n't know how it happened . Henry Wu is half her size and has no facial hair . He smokes Virginia Slims . The long cigarettes look like dinner knives in his tiny fists . Emily is the one who told me . She came into my office yesterday . I knew that it was serious . She never interrupts my work . She looked as sad as if the market had dropped 150 points . " It has to do with money only indirectly , " she said . " It has to do with Henry Wu . " I thought she was going to tell me that he had programmed the Cray to put everyone 's money into his own Swiss bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stock calculations were accurate , I was still not sure he even had a valid driver 's license . Emily told me straight out that she was in love with Henry Wu , I did n't know what to say . I thought it was a joke . It was as if the Englishman , Higgins , in the office next door popped in to tell me casually that he had discovered gravity was a Newtonian error . Emily is the only woman I have ever known intimately . She is my definition of a woman . We have been married for six years , almost ready , I thought , to start a family . A sample of her blood bombarded by neutrinos as old as the universe is the heart of my work . " What do you mean , you love Henry Wu ? " " I mean I think about him all the time . When I 'm at Safeway , when I 'm reading or exercising , all the time . I keep hoping I 'll hear his footsteps . I think about kissing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cantaloupe . " Is it his stock market program that 's made you fall in love with him ? " I could n't think of any other reason . " Money has nothing to do with it . Henry has no personal investments . His interest is wholly theoretical . He knows he could go to Hong Kong or Singapore and sell his program for a fortune , but he does n't want to undermine capitalism . He loves this country . " She sat in a swivel chair across from my desk . I did n't know what to do . I walked over and kissed the top of her head . She touched my hand . I have seen such moments in the movies many times , but nothing prepared me for it . Emily offered to move out of the house . I told her no , it would be easier for me to move into the lab . I had a couch and a small refrigerator , and there was a hot plate and a microwave in the lounge . She said that was nice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent to her . " Why would n't I want to be nice to the woman I love ? " She was pale and looked ready to cry . We sat in my office for a few minutes without saying anything . Then Emily stood to leave . When she got to the door I asked her if this meant we were n't going to have a child . She cried then and walked out the door . On my desk was a profile of a large mole-am studying a fragment of my wife , that I am seeing in the most minute way , atom by atom , who she is . Of course her molecular structure is similar to everyone else 's , but not exactly . When I tell her things like this , Emily calls me a romantic , says that 's why she fell in love with me . We met when she was a lab assistant and I was in graduate school . She said she liked how dreamy I looked when she was going from station to station cleaning up . I did like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber gloves . When she was in the room , I could n't concentrate . In the spring when she wore a light shirt , I could see the sides of her breasts . On my way back to Lazlo 's office I saw that Wu , as usual , was in the lounge beside the big screen . About a dozen scientists were sitting on folding chairs , watching the economy . As word of Wu 's program spread in Los Alamos , people outside the physics group started drifting over to see what he was up to . Most of the time Wu was about as interesting as Lazio asking about torque or engine-gunk buildup . Wu did n't talk about what people wanted to hear . After the first meeting he made no more market predictions . He did n't have to . Everything was still going as he said it would . He said he had used the Cray to establish a mathematical constant between liquidity and greed as measured by personal savings . His model went back to Europe in the fourteenth century , though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own estimates . Henry Wu saw me coming . 1 did n't say hello or ask about the market . He did not seem happy to see me . " I 've just discovered , " he said , " that during the worst years of bubonic plague , when a quarter of the population of Europe died , the market system operated smoothly . My extrapolation tells me that nuclear war would not destroy the Street . " " I want to know about my wife , about what 's going on with you and Emily . " Henry Wu moved behind the Cray as if he thought I was going to attack him . He looked at the scientists watching the screen . Nobody was listening to us . All their attention was on their investments . Wu and I both spoke quietly , making noises no louder than the Cray . I repeated Emily 's name . That was enough . Henry Wu knew what I meant . He changed the subject . " I have been working night and day to glean the inevitable from the Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic reality . " As he said that his beeper went off . He was embarrassed . " Lazio probably needs a ride to Kentucky Fried Chicken . . . Sometimes I feel like I 'm his slave , but it 's only for a few hours a day , a small price to pay for the constant use of the big one . " When Wu left I went back to my lab . I looked at the fragments of my sample under the electron microscope . I could not stop thinking of Emily kissing Henry Wu . We had decided that when she was thirty , in just a few months , we would begin to have children . I had been ready for years . I was already dreaming of vacations with a couple of little ones in a cabin in the hills . We would teach them to ski . Emily and I both liked skiing . For children Los Alamos would be wonderful  --  desert , mountains , no traffic . Maybe I should have known something was wrong when Emily told me she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she told me she missed big-city traffic . We were isolated in Los Alamos , but she was n't leaving Los Alamos , she was leaving me . My sample was now in the midst of bonding to polymers . The strands of hemoglobin curled like tiny hairs . At the atomic level matter either bonds or does not bond , In nature what can happen does happen . The big molecule under my microscope was not recognizably Emily 's . I had bombarded it with high energy so often that it no longer resembled the sticky substance of herself . But I still thought of it as a fragment of my wife . What 's a person ? In the sample , her DNA , though confused , was still intact . If I could insert the big molecule back into the rush of her bloodstream , everything that I had done to that single molecule would not even cause her an upset stomach . I already had a change of clothes in my lab . There was no reason to go home at all . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole situation dispassionately . I told myself that humans are sexual creatures . Reason has never dominated either individual or group behavior . Henry Wu and Emily were acting out a pattern over which even they had little control . My anger , my jealousy , my desire to obstruct them , were as reasonable as their behavior . Each of us was just trying to spread our genes in the most efficient way . Wu and Emily wanted each other . At a fundamental level , it did not involve people . Their genes were overcoming mine . This dispassionate thinking made perfect sense but it did not convince me or make me feel any better . I thought of Henry Wu blowing his cigarette smoke through my house . Even at the level of genes I did n't see how she could prefer his . Vera knocked to ask if I had any trash . I unlocked the door and gave her the slide I had been working on for six months . She threw it in her barrel . " See you tomorrow , " she said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on all the other doors in the corridor . Vera has no security clearance , so she ca n't unlock anything . I heard her close the outside door . I tuned in a classical station on the radio and lay down on my couch to watch the sun set behind the administration building . Then I must have fallen asleep , because when I woke up it was very dark and I was a little hungry . I walked to the kitchenette at the rear of the lounge and heard someone in there . It was Lazlo singing " Home on the Range " in his Hungarian accent . I did n't want to see him so I tiptoed back to my office . The phone rang as soon as I got there . It was Emily calling to tell me she would leave the house the next week and I could live there . She said that she was sorry that she could not move away from Los Alamos . Henry had to stay because nowhere else in the world could he have twenty-four-hour access to the Cray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , never come to any social events , she did n't want things to be too hard for me . I thanked her . Then l threw away all the rest of my slides . More than 300 samples of her hemoglobin , bonded and unbonded , filled the incinerator . I knew that by doing so I was destroying government property , but I knew that the property had no value . If 1 could face the truth about Emily and Wu , I could face it with my experiment as well . It was only a coincidence , but my life and my work at that moment coincided . My work was as silly as Lazlo 's Nobel Prize experiments . Fresh from Europe , before he even knew English , he had done his post-cloc in background radiation . He produced a lot of insignificant calculations . As it happened , twenty years later , other cosmologists realized that Lazlo 's work proved the Big Bang theory . By then Lazlo was a washed-up old man eating fried chicken and telling congressional committees to spend more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he went to Sweden to pick up his prize , Lazlo was a joke in the scientific community . He had n't published a paper in fifteen years . During conferences he never asked questions . On his notepads he doodled . Whenever someone would take him along , he liked to go to the stock-car races in Albuquerque . Or , when he would get a ride to Santa Fe , he liked to buy turquoise from the Indians as if he were a weekend tourist . He wore a gaudy turquoise ring on each hand . I wondered if I was going to become a Lazlo . It 's something every scientist worries about . When we reach thirty , we know our best work is behind us . At 3 A.M. I went back to the kitchenette for a glass of milk . Lazio was there cooking Heinz vegetable soup . When he saw me drinking milk he asked if he could have a little for his soup . He drank the soup from a cup stained with coffee . I remembered hearing Vera say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evicted from a public housing project . " Did you hear Henry Wu yesterday ? " Lazio asked . " He showed everyone how he adjusts the constant in his formula . He thinks he understands the movement of capital since the beginning of the fourteenth century . " " I 'm not interested in what Henry Wu thinks . " At that hour Lazio and I were alone in the three-story physics building . He seemed happy to have company . He wanted to talk . " Since Wu started everyone in the market it 's so quiet that you can hear the field mice at night . There used to be people here all the time . Computations ran through the night . I even remember seeing you here now and then . " " Do you think people are not working as hard because everyone is busy with the stock market ? " " I think , " Lazio said , " that if I did n't know the Russians so well , I 'd believe they sent Henry Wu to keep us from all the Star Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Soviet plant ? " " No , the Russians are not that clever . " " Who sent him , then ? " " The gods . They 're not always malicious . " I did n't know what he meant . Lazlo put his arm around me . For the first time I thought of him as a wise man , someone from whom I could learn . I was ashamed of myself for years of thinking that his Nobel Prize was insignificant . Right there , in the middle of the night , I admitted that I thought of him as an old fool , and decided to apologize . " You were not wrong , " Lazio said . " The only thing you did n't realize is that the rest of them are worse . " Together we walked toward the Cray . " I 'm going to show you what he 's doing , what has turned world-class scientists into idiots . " Lazio ran the Cray . " Wu gives them a graphics program just like the IBM makes for kids . He shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market is going up thirty points a day . Physicists are as greedy as pigs . " The big screen flashed a fuzzy human image . It looked female above the waist , but the figure had long , muscular male legs and thighs . The figure was walking slowly across pitch-black space . It carried a walking stick as if there were a place in the void to set it down . " You should listen to Wu narrate this , " Lazio said . " He tells them this bisexual figure is humanity and the walking stick is money . " Lazio in his Hungarian accent tried to imitate Wu 's high-pitched Oriental voice in characteristic inflection . " Stick disappears , figure wobbles . Remember importance of capital . In midst of plague , market economy flourished . " Lazio laughed at his own imitation . On the screen the figure wobbled like a dying star . " Henry Wu 's constant , " Lazio said . " They talk about it like it 's a prime number , like it 's something in the universe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch his cartoons and believe his mumbo jumbo . " The old man pushed some buttons and the screen became black once more . The Cray still hummed , waiting for more instructions . " My wife left me for Henry Wu yesterday . " I told this to Lazio as a fact , friend to friend . He said nothing . " I 've been bombarding my molecule for four years with no results to speak of . Tonight I threw it away . I was hoping that next year we would have a child . " Lazlo pushed some more buttons on the Cray . He was having fun . " Henry Wu thinks I do n't know how to use this machine . He thinks I sleep nights . How old is your wife ? " " Twenty-nine . " The screen flashed two figures . I knew that it was Henry Wu and Emily followed by three squat Eurasian children . They were walking slowly through the emptiness of the big screen . " Those are the children I might have had . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wu 's program makes images . Those figures are the square of your wife 's age . " It was only twenty-nine squared , but the segments moving along on the big screen brought tears to my eyes . " I 'm sorry , " Lazio said . He erased the image . " Someday your work may be fruitful . If not the Nobel Prize , maybe you 'll win other prizes . At least you wo n't be a Henry Wu , making cartoons . " I followed Lazio back to the lounge . I noticed he was wearing slippers . He started to open another can . " Cream of tomato this time . It 's very good , you 'll see . I like all the cream soups . " Down the hall the Cray hummed , and through the Los Alamos darkness , the physicists , asleep , were awaiting the happiness of another opening bell on Wall Street . Henry Wu 's bull roared through the universe . His Eurasian children sprang from my wife . Lazio and I shared a cup of soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll prick myself and start again with a new molecule , this time my own . a
