The first time Coach Norman Dale ( Gene Hackman ) meets his new team , everyone witnessing the encounter knows intuitively that whatever obstacles lie in their path , the Hickory Huskers are going to win the high school basketball championship of Indiana this season . <P> This conviction arises not from any air of promise about them but from their total lack of it . Norman and his charges are such stuff as Rocky Balboa and the Karate Kid are made of  --  not to mention old Frank Capra movies . The coach is a Knight-errant , a good man with a blemish on his record that only redemptive labors can expunge . The players are few in number and woefully lacking in any natural gift for the game . Worse , Hickory 's only talented hoopster has quit the squad , and the townsfolk do not care for Norman 's outsider independence . All the Huskers have going for them is that they are undermutts representing a very small , very poor town . But as every moviegoer knows , that is a guarantee that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , just possibly , as every moviemaker dares hope , gross big . <P> Still , if some cynical calculation attended the making of Hoosiers , some honest craft went into it as well . Someone remembered , or went to the trouble of finding out , how it felt to live in a small Midwestern town in the 1950s , when there was nothing better to chew on than last week 's game and nothing better to savor than next Friday 's . By laconically contrasting images of despair and hope  --  bleak winter fields and the throbbing heat and noise of a jam-packed gym in the fourth quarter when the game is close  --  Director Anspaugh achieves an admirable objectivity . He neither condemns nor justifies the sporting passion when it is distorted by claustrophobic pressure . He just tries to understand it . <P> A similar spirit moves in his actors . Hackman is wonderful as an inarticulate man tense with the struggle to curb a flaring , mysterious anger . Barbara Hershey is just as fine as a teacher trying to put a dispassionate face on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forceful observation and a jittery melancholy to his characterization of a onetime star athlete who has become the town drunk . There is a quirky authenticity about these figures , and the landscape they inhabit , that one does not expect to find in movies whose chief business is to warm the heart , not to inform it . Hoosiers may not transcend the banality of its story line , but it does take its shot . And comes close to making the movie equivalent of a three-point play .
