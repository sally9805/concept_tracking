ROUGH STRIFE by Lynne Sharon Schwartz <P> Harper &; Row ; 200 pages ; $9.95 <P> Caroline is a mathematician who specializes in topology and knot theory . Husband Ivan is an executive at a New York City museum . He relishes detachment , irony and ambiguity ; she favors directness , clarity and definite answers . But Ivan is more demanding than Caroline : " She could forgive a good deal of grossness so long as there was not emotional dishonesty , but he required aesthetic purity and was harsh about lapses in taste . He said that if something was shoddily executed it had unquestionably been shoddily conceived and insufficiently felt . This rigor in him , especially when directed at a well-meaning movie , gave her a sinking , hopeless feeling . Yet she knew that it was so in her own work : everything true and useful proceeded from a clear statement of the premises . " <P> The premise of Lynne Sharon Schwartz 's true and useful first novel is that marriage is a form of " unconditional acceptance " and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitely twisted , tugged and pushed , provided that no shapes were snapped in two , or poked with holes , or forced inside out . " <P> This striking topological analogy also applies to Rough Strife , a brainy , sensuous reshaping of courtly love , romantic cliches , sex stereotypes and many of the truisms that keep two people sleeping , eating and , above all , talking together for most of their lives . <P> Young Caroline meets Ivan during a Roman holiday in the late 1950s . At 29 , he is one of those postwar perennial students , a Fulbright scholar studying the relationship of architecture to the rise and fall of empires . His real talent , he believes , lies elsewhere . " I think , " he says to Caroline , " I would be good at telling people how to go about getting what they want . That 's if they know what they want to begin with . " <P> At that moment , Caroline wants to get this attractive intellectual to bed . Ivan is in no hurry ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erudition . Rather than toss coins in a fountain , he guides her to the Campidoglio to see the caged she-wolf , symbol of the mythical beast that suckled Romulus and Remus . The animal , " glowering from slate-gray eyes that looked at once treacherous and ready to weep , " suddenly howls in their faces . <P> Eight years after her marriage , Caroline is in obstetrical stirrups being delivered of their first child : " She was n't supposed to roar , the natural childbirth teacher had n't mentioned anything about that , she was supposed to breathe and push . But as long as no one seemed to take any notice she might as well keep on , it felt so satisfying and necessary ... The sound reminded her of something she had heard long ago . " <P> The point , richly made throughout the novel , is that a perceptive Ivan was drawn to a wildness just beneath Caroline 's cool , efficient exterior . She , in turn , understands that Ivan 's passionate statements about art and politics cloak a chilly , analytical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physical depth to their marriage .
