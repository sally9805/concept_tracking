Miss Boudin , speaking in a low , firm voice , told of her role in the Rockland County robbery and killings and of her remorse over the consequences. // " I feel terrible about the lives that were lost , " she told Judge David S. Ritter . " I have led a life of commitment to political principles , and I think I can be true to those principles without engaging in violent acts. " // <> <> 20 Years to Life // // Judge Ritter said he would sentence the 40-year-old Miss Boudin next Thursday to 20 years to life in prison . Since Miss Boudin has already spent three years in prison , she will be eligible for parole in 2001. // If she had gone to trial and been found guilty , she would probably have been sentenced to 25 years to life on each of three counts of murder , terms that she probably would have had to serve consecutively. // With Miss Boudin ' s guilty plea , only one of the Brink ' s defendants remains to be tried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westchester County Court , where the case was moved because of pretrial publicity . Miss Boudin ' s mother , Jean , sat three rows back , composed and surrounded by friends . One of them was Bernardine Dohrn , like Miss Boudin a former member of the radical Weather Underground organization . Miss Dohrn is now the legal guardian of Miss Boudin ' s 3-year-old son , Chesa. // <> <> Accord With Prosecutor // // Kenneth A. Gribetz , the Rockland County District Attorney , said Miss Boudin ' s attorneys had approached him last week seeking agreement on a lesser sentence for a guilty plea . The talks , which later included Judge Ritter , continued until 11 this morning. // Leonard I. Weinglass , who has been Miss Boudin ' s principal attorney , said after the court session that the defendant had sought to plead guilty only to the robbery charge , which could have brought a term of 8 1/2 to 25 years , but that Mr. Gribetz had insisted on Miss Boudin also pleading guilty to at least one count of murder as well. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the provision of the felony murder law that a participant in a felony where a murder is committed is also guilty of the murder . In this case , the felony is the $1. 6 million holdup of the armored truck outside the Nanuet Mall on Oct. 20 , 1981 by a group of self-styled radicals . Miss Boudin said she had not been a participant in the slayings , but had played a role in driving one of the getaway vehicles. // Mr. Weinglass said , " It ' s not so much a matter of comparing her 20 years to 25 years , " the minimum time she would have served for a murder conviction , " but comparing 20 years to 75 years , " the minimum term for three consecutive murder convictions . For Mr. Gribetz , the plea bargain represents an end to what might have proved to be a troublesome case against Miss Boudin . The prosecution had conceded that Miss Boudin did not carry a gun or shoot anybody . But Mr. Gribetz would have tried to show , through tiny glass fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holdup. // The prosecution had no witnesses who could place Miss Boudin at the robbery scene . In court today , she said that while she had been a passenger in one of the vehicles used to flee the scene , she had emerged from the car with her hands up at a roadblock in Nyack and had not been involved in the slaying of the two police officers there. // Mr. Gribetz said he had been " surprised that they approached us last Thursday . " The prosecutor said he had conferred with the families of the slain police officers about the proposed plea . " We all agreed that justice would be done with this result , " he said . " It ' s a very strong sentence. " // Judge Ritter said he had accepted Miss Boudin ' s guilty plea in full satisfaction of the 13 charges against her. // Mr. Gribetz said he would continue to prosecute the case against Samuel Brown , Miss Boudin ' s co-defendant . <> <> Differences in Cases // // " Our evidence is that he killed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Gribetz said. // After today ' s plea , Miss Boudin was permitted to confer with her father , the lawyer Leonard Boudin , and her mother . As he left the heavily guarded eighth-floor courtroom , Mr. Boudin was asked if his daughter felt relieved that the case was over. // " In one sense , everyone is relieved to end a certain aspect of one ' s life , " he said . " The case is now behind us . " Then he thought for a moment , looked at his wife , and said , " I can ' t be objective about it . She ' s not just a client ; she ' s a daughter. " // Miss Boudin , who will be eligible for parole when she is 58 , searched for familiar faces in the courtroom before the session , as she had done regularly since the court sessions began . Her co-defendant , Mr. Brown , maintained his usual impassive manner as he sat at a table to her left . Mr. Gribetz and his aides sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // That had been the setting since mid- February , when jury selection and pretrial hearings began . More than 2 , 600 potential jurors were screened in two stages to produce a panel of Westchester residents who claimed neither hardship nor bias in the case. // A final panel of 12 jurors with four alternates will be selected , now only to hear Mr. Brown ' s case , after hearings that are under way to determine if Mr. Brown is competent to stand trial. // Although few of the potential jurors testified that they had read of Mr. Brown , many knew of Miss Boudin . Some recalled that she was an alumna of Bryn Mawr College , from which she graduated in of 1965 ; others recognized her father as a noted civil rights lawyer , and many associated her with the 1970 explosion of a Greenwich Village town house that was being used by radicals as a bomb factory . Three people died in the blast. // Outside the courtroom today , Mr. Boudin had other memories of his daughter in the years before the blast at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and with the blind in high school , and organizing a civil rights conference in the South. // Mr. Weinglass , speaking to another knot of reporters , said that throughout this and earlier Brink ' s trials , Miss Boudin " was offered a lenient sentence if she would cooperate " with prosecutors . " But she refused , so now she will spend the rest of her life in jail , " he said. // Mr. Gribetz said he did not plan to call Miss Boudin to testify in Mr. Brown ' s trial. // The Brink ' s robbery attracted widespread interest , largely because most of the defendants had been identified as members of the Black Panthers , the Black Liberation Army and the Weather Underground , radical groups long out of public view. // Although the robbery and murders took place in Rockland County , the first trial was moved to Judge Ritter ' s Orange County courtroom after a state appeals court ruled that the defendants could not get a fair trial because of heavy local publicity and extraordinary security measures. // After Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severed , three other defendants , Judith A. Clark , 33 , Kuwasi Balagoon , 36 , and David Gilbert , 39 , were convicted last September of murder , robbery and lesser charges and sentenced to 75 years to life in prison . Miss Boudin married Mr. Gilbert , the father of her child , in a jailhouse ceremony on the day of his conviction. // Earlier in September , a Federal jury in Manhattan found four others guilty of conspiracy , racketeering and lesser offenses in the Brink ' s case and other holdups . They received sentences of up to 40 years in prison. // Defendants in those trials , calling themselves " political prisoners " and " freedom fighters , " had ignored or rejected lawyers seeking to defend them , instead choosing what came to be known as revolutionary defenses . Miss Boudin and Mr. Brown , by contrast , chose to be represented by lawyers and have avoided courtroom outbursts. //
