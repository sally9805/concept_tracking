Shultz and Weinberger present different views of military power <P> Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger have been working together for most of the past 15 years : as high economic officials of the Nixon Administration ; then as top executives of Bechtel , the worldwide construction firm ; and currently as the most powerful members of Ronald Reagan 's Cabinet . They breakfast together once a week , alternating as hosts , and confer frequently by telephone . When Shultz was asked last week about their reported disputes , he replied , " That 's nonsense . " <P> That is for the record . Privately , U.N . Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick has told friends worriedly that the tension between Shultz , her nominal superior , and Weinberger has become " palpable . " A Pentagon insider is blunter . Their dislike , says he , " is only thinly disguised when they meet publicly . " <P> What is more , the feud is not simply a personal one . For months , Shultz and Weinberger have been giving Reagan conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lately they have been carrying on what amounts to a public debate . <P> Weinberger opened a new round with a speech three weeks ago , taking issue with earlier statements by Shultz . The Secretary of Defense laid down six conditions for the use of U.S. combat troops abroad . Some were unexceptionable : " We should have clearly defined political and military objectives . " But others were more controversial . Military power , said Weinberger , should be used only " as a last resort " to protect " vital interests " of the U.S. or its allies , only " with the clear intention of winning " and only if there is " some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress . " <P> On a broad range of issues-arms control , trade with the Communist world , dealings with NATO allies , to name a few-Weinberger is far more hawkish than Shultz . But on the use of U.S. armed forces , the Pentagon boss reflects the views of military commanders who still shudder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to see the Sandinista regime topple in Nicaragua , Weinberger has ruled out direct U.S. military involvement . Said he : " The President will not allow our military forces to creep-or be drawn gradually-into a combat role in Central America . " Shultz , while no less opposed to military entanglements in that region , has long insisted that his diplomats must be backed up by a credible willingness to use force . He replied to Weinberger in a speech of his own last week , arguing that " there is no such thing as guaranteed public support in advance . " If force is used effectively , as in Grenada , he said , public support will follow ; if not , as in Viet Nam , it will be " frittered away . " He added , " A great power can not free it self so easily from the burden of choice . "
