But a weekend settlement favorable to the strikers could end the crisis <P> Clambering to the top of the shipyard 's high iron gate , the little man with the walrus mustache struck a pose of accustomed authority . With outstretched arms , he waved down the combined cheers of the striking workers behind him and the massed crowd of sympathizers outside the gate , and lifted a microphone to his mouth . This time , however , instead of a rousing exhortation to militancy , his message was a somber admonition : to curtail the spread of further strikes across his nation and give the government the necessary breath a while . " It is not good to have Poland terrorized , " the strike leader , Lech Walesa , told the crowd . " The people must have food . Poland can only last for a few more days under these conditions . " Then , with a more characteristic tone of defiance , he added , " If we do n't get results in a few days , then let the strikes spread .

It showed that the strike leaders had come to recognize the momentous perils and potentially tragic consequences of what they had begun . Their emotional yet disciplined strike for rights , a grass-roots upheaval that was in many ways unprecedented in Moscow 's postwar fiefdoms of Eastern Europe , had left Poland teetering on a tightrope . <P> Beneath on one side was the tantalizing prospect of far-reaching reforms that would change Poland 's political landscape , with incalculable repercussions elsewhere in the Soviet dominions . The beleaguered government had made a series of concessions that were remarkable for a Communist regime . Now the negotiations had reached a climax over the most crucial demand : a free-trade-union movement outside Communist Party control , a virtual contradiction in terms for a Marxist worker state . On the other side was the yawning void of disorder and a crackdown that , should violence erupt , might bring armed Soviet intervention . <P> At week 's end strike leaders and government negotiators announced agreement on " a formula designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipyard workers cheered , one of their leaders read a communiqu stating that they would be permitted to form an " independent , self-governing trade union .

Sympathy walkouts had spread to at least a dozen other cities . Strikes also broke out among copper miners and ironworkers in lower Silesia . <P> With northern ports , factories and transportation at a standstill , sugar and flour shortages were mounting ; gasoline was no longer available to the public in Gdansk . Communist Party Leader Edward Gierek , shaken by a purge precipitated by the workers ' actions , seemed increasingly in jeopardy . Poland and the watching world were rife with rumors that Gierek 's days in power were numbered .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
