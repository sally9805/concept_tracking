This definition may not have made Webster ' s Dictionary , but within the real estate industry it rings true. // Many of the large commercial projects built in the past two years , and still more on the drawing boards , are joint ventures between lenders and developers. // For example , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company on July 20 announced it would form a $500 million joint venture with Metropolitan Structures , a large Chicago builder . And , on Sept. 14 Aetna Life &; Casualty Company formed a joint venture with Marvin Davis , the new owner of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation properties , at a cost of $183 million to the insurer . Still smaller companies and developers have joined in as well . This week , A.P.A. Transport , a New Jersey-based trucking firm , announced a $7. 75 million joint venture with a Fort Lee , N.J. , builder , C. Raimondo &; Sons Company , to develop a stretch of deserted New Jersey waterfront along the Hudson River. // Such joint ventures , says Leanne Lachman , president of Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are now a fact of life nationally in the commercial real estate world . Ms. Lachman points out that institutional lenders such as pensions and insurance companies are less willing to make conventional mortgage types of loans on properties . Instead , they are asking for equity - a stake in the project - in return for their participation . Thus , they end up as the financial partners in real estate deals . The developers often bring properties and experience. // This was the case with Metropolitan Life and Metropolitan Structures . Met Structures owned some important properties in Chicago , which will become part of the joint venture . This includes several properties in Illinois Center in Chicago , an 83-acre lakefront project in downtown Chicago . Within the center , the joint venture will own the downtown Hyatt Hotel , four office towers , a condominium , and 40 acres of undeveloped land. // Also included in the deal are 1 South Wacker Drive , which is currently under construction , and the Mercantile Exchange , which is also under construction . Metropolitan Life also included some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Connecticut , a New York Telephone building in New York City , the Reynolds Metal Building in Richmond , Va. , and the Indiana National Bank building in Indianapolis. // According to Glen E. Coverdale , senior vice-president at Metropolitan Life , the big insurer decided on Metropolitan Structures for their partner since ' ' we liked what they had done in downtown mixed-use land development . ' ' Metropolitan Structures , which has since changed its name to Metco Properties ( the joint venture adopted the name Metropolitan Structures ) , had developed properties in Chicago , Aurora , Ill. , and Montreal among other places. // Bernard Weissbourd , chairman of Metropolitan Structures , says his firm was interested in the deal since it allowed the company to increase its capital base , making it competitive ' ' around the country with the Canadian companies , which are more strongly financed than their US competitors . ' ' He figures with the $500 million in new capital , plus the borrowing ability of Met Life , the new joint venture will have ' ' unlimited staying power ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that when the big insurance company looks for a partner for a real estate joint venture , it looks for ' ' . . . people with a good standing and knowledge of their individual communities . We look for skills in specific types of areas , such as mixed-use areas which are complex and require a unique type of skill . ' ' On a much smaller scale , Met Life has been involved in joint ventures since 1968. // Metropolitan Structures likewise has been involved in joint ventures before , including projects with IC Industries , the Prudential Insurance Company of America , and Standard Oil Company . However , these were mainly on a building-by-building basis . This new project , says Mr. Weissbourd , will involve all new activity. // In the case of Aetna , the properties it became joint owner of included Fox ' s 63-acre studio site at Century City , Calif. , the assets of Aspen Skiing Corporation , and the Pebble Beach Corporation , and some other properties. // Generally , the shift from lender to owner has come quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise in interest rates in 1979 . By December of that year the real estate industry was ' ' numb , ' ' and it remained dormant for eight months . At the same time , lenders , scalped by inflation , sought some way to keep their assets from shrinking . The joint venture seemed to fit perfectly. // The advantages of the joint venture is that it teams the developers , who are often long on ideas , with the insurance companies who have great financial staying power . For the most part , says Ms. Lachman , the joint ventures have worked out well since they combine ' ' some pretty professional developers with some pretty smart institutions. // However , when problems do develop , Ms. Lachman says , they usually revolve around money . ' ' The first problem , ' ' she says , ' ' is if construction costs exceed the budget . ' ' If that is the case , the institution often increases its financial stake since the developer is often short cash. // The second problem is if the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' You must continue to pay the operating expenses , ' ' says Ms. Lachman , ' ' and the money must come from somewhere . ' ' At this stage , the institution often buys out the partner. // A third problem arises if the investment turns out to be in the wrong location . In this case , the institution might become the sole owner of it or try to sell it to someone else. // Joint-venture marriages also aren ' t always made in heaven . Ms. Lachman warns ' ' the real estate industry has always been tricky and is full of alert entrepreneurial people who are on the watch for uninformed money . You have to be alert because real estate is a risky business. ' ' // //
