According to recently compiled figures from the 1980 census , about half the 14. 6 million people who listed themselves as being of Spanish extraction live in the central cities of the nation ' s metropolitan areas . But more than five million , or 37 percent , live in the suburbs and rural fringes of the cities , while the remainder , almost two million , are in rural counties , mostly in the Southwest. // The figures also show that in many areas Hispanic Americans have migrated in greater numbers than blacks into the newer , rapidly growing suburban areas outside the large cities. // In Aurora , a city of 81 , 000 on the outer fringes of the Chicago metropolitan area , the 1980 count found 14 , 482 Hispanic residents , or 17. 8 percent of its population. // Until the last few years , Aurora could have been the setting for a Sinclair Lewis novel about life in a small Middle Western town .

The movie houses show Spanish-language films , there are several Mexican restaurants and bars , and record stores bathe some shopping malls with the latest hits from south of the border. // Homero Basalda , executive director of Centro Pan American , a social services organization that occupies a storefront building in Aurora ' s downtown commercial district , said most Hispanic residents found life in small communities outside Chicago more pleasant than in the city because most of the migrants came from rural areas in Mexico and the Southwest . Here , he said , they can find large houses for their families with land to grow gardens as they did in the South. // Other areas near Chicago also show a relatively high proportion of Hispanic residents . Kane County , Ill. , where new suburban bedroom communities are springing up , showed a Hispanic population of almost 10 percent in the 1980 count , a higher percentage than for the Chicago metropolitan area as a whole. // The trend is not universal . New York City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven for Puerto Ricans coming to America to find jobs , is one exception . According to census figures less than 6 percent of New York ' s Hispanic residents live in the suburbs , as against 27 percent for Chicago and 66 percent in the Miami area . The Census Bureau considers Newark and its adjoining cities and suburbs a separate metropolitan area , but even if the New York and Newark areas are combined , 86 percent of the region ' s Hispanic residents live in the five boroughs of New York City. // Determining the number of Hispanics in the United States has been one of the most difficult tasks facing the Census Bureau . The term Hispanic refers to people whose forebears came from nations where Spanish is a major language . It does not refer to race as Hispanic persons can be white , black or have other racial classifications . The 1980 census form contained questions that asked whether persons were " of Spanish/Hispanic origin or descent , " and then asked them to check whether they were " Mexican , Mexican-American , Chicano ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Most of Mexican Descent // The Census Bureau says that its count is still subject to revision and that it has not yet compiled specific figures for the 14. 6 million people who noted they were of Hispanic origin . But surveys conducted before the census count indicated that more than 60 percent were of Mexican descent with Puerto Ricans and Cubans constituting most of the remainder . The determination is further complicated by the fact that most of the illegal aliens in this nation are believed to be of Hispanic origin , and they usually do not fill out census forms . No one knows how many foreigners are here illegally , but most estimates are three to five million. // By most estimates and from all available evidence the Hispanic population in the United States grew faster in the last decade than the population as a whole , which increased 11. 4 percent . <> <> Many in New-Growth Areas // Well over half the Hispanic residents counted by the Census Bureau live in Western states that are experiencing rapid economic growth .

The Newark area has about 132 , 000 , less than half in the central city. // Many Hispanic residents are farm workers who live on the fringes of the metropolitan areas . But in heavily populated areas such as Los Angeles County there are substantial numbers of Hispanic people in most communities . In the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area , 58 percent of the two million Hispanics live outside the boundaries of the two cities. // Many metropolitan areas remained unaffected by the general increase in Hispanic residents .

Hispanic residents have been moving into the declining , nearby industrial suburbs , as have blacks , but often in greater numbers . Cicero , for example , which in the 1960 ' s violently resisted black families moving in , has more than 5 , 000 Hispanic residents but only 74 blacks , according to census figures. //
