Dear Ann Landers : After reading your advice to housewives , it was obvious that you have a lot to learn about repairmen . Your advice to keep dogs locked up when repairmen come in is not only ignorant but dangerous . I had a big black springer spaniel who was so smart I sometimes thought he had the brain of a human . He was a gentle dog , but the size of him frightened a lot of people . " Sparky " knew how to get the door open from the outside and I always left it unlocked so he could come and go at will . When friends or family members would drop by , Sparky stayed outside , but when a repair person or salesman appeared at the door he would come right in and sit between the stranger and me . One afternoon a man came to fix my washer-dryer . He worked for about 30 minutes and then came in the kitchen where I was canning and asked for a cold drink . Like a flash , Sparky was in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for some unknown reason he began to growl and show his teeth . The man quickly said : " Forget the drink . I ' m just about finished . " In less than three minutes he was gone . I now know that Sparky sensed something was wrong . He came in the house to protect me . After I thought about it , I didn ' t like the look on that man ' s face when he asked for a cold drink . Please , Ann , don ' t tell housewives to lock up their dogs when repair people come in . Those are the times when dogs can be most useful . Palo Alto Dear Pal : Your letter certainly proves that there are two sides to every story . When a reader complained about how repair people get snapped at and bitten by family pets , I agreed that they should be kept locked up . But now I ' m not so sure . Readers ? Where do you stand ? Dear Ann Landers : I read with interest your letter from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her stepfather for the past seven years . As a police investigator of sexual assaults on children , I can tell you that this child will continue to struggle with conflicts between her own guilt and her anger toward her stepfather , along with a fear of destroying her mother ' s marriage . Your advice to seek therapy was excellent . I hope she listens . The girl ' s stepfather is a pedophile , and we now know that pedophiles do not stop when confronted . They continue to sexually abuse until they are forced to stop by the judicial system . This individual has almost certainly abused other children . The pedophilic condition is described as being similar to that of an alcoholic . He may come to a point in therapy where he is no longer abusing but will always be a pedophile . While sexual abuse of children has for years been considered " the family secret , " you need to emphasize repeatedly to your readers that incest and sexual assault on children are felonies and deserve to be prosecuted to the fullest extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has convinced me that the only way they can become well-adjusted adults is by finding the courage to come forward and make a full report to law enforcement and social service agencies . Please , Ann , help us to get this message across to your readers . Walt Parsons , Detective , Investigations Division , Arvada Police Department , Arvada , Colo . Dear Walt Parsons : You got the message across and I thank you.  --   --   --   --   --  When planning a wedding , who pays for what ? Who stands where ?
