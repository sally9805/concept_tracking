" All around us there was this twisted mass of wreckage and tons of coal spread around . And then there was this lady 's shoe . It was incredible , just haunting . " That was the way Doug Llewelyn , an executive producer for Los Angeles-based Westgate Productions , described what it was like to view the sunken wreck of the ocean liner Titanic at first hand . Recalls Yann Keranflech , a member of the $2.5 million French expedition that last summer salvaged some 800 artifacts from the wreck : " You think about the victims . If you find a pair of shoes or a suitcase , you ask yourself if the person managed to survive . " <P> On these pages , TIME presents exclusive photographs of the salvage operation , the Titanic itself and some of the recovered treasures . Among the objects brought up by French divers : a bronze teapot and coffeepot , a leather valise , a rococo vase , a statue of a cherub from the Titanic 's first-class grand staircase and a ship 's safe , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week television audiences around the world will be able to see footage of the awesome wreck , as well as objects from the Titanic that have not been seen since the " unsinkable " liner foundered on its maiden voyage in 1912 , at a cost of 1,500 lives . The program 's climax : the opening of the safe , a stunt that will inevitably be compared with TV Correspondent Geraldo Rivera 's much ridiculed 1986 on-camera opening of Al Capone 's empty " vault " in Chicago ( a show also produced by Westgate ) . After filing unsuccessfully to block the broadcast , Florida Investor Michael Harris and four coplaintiffs are suing Westgate and other investors for $300 million , claiming they were cheated out of a share of the profits . <P> For years after the Titanic disaster , the exact location of the ship was unknown . It was not until 1985 that an expedition mounted by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the French Institute for Research and Development of the Sea ( IFREMER ) found it broken into two pieces in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,500 ft. of water . The following year , Woods Hole Marine Geologist Robert Ballard returned to probe inside the rusting hull and take photographs . But Ballard 's crew left the ship and its artifacts undisturbed and urged others to do the same as a memorial to those who had died in the tragedy . <P> Their French colleagues disagreed . Last July an IFREMER ship arrived at the site , and over the next 54 days researchers , filmmakers and financial backers made 32 dives in the submersible Nautile . The salvagers used two remote manipulator arms to pluck objects from the ocean floor and place them in a collecting basket . There were , notes Keranflech , " strange anomalies  --  a silver plate still as bright as if it had just been polished . Crystal glasses , beautiful porcelain plates and cups . When we brought them to the surface , ; everyone rushed up to see . We wanted to expose them to the air as little as possible , but it would have been criminal not to let the crew see them . " Recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We opened a leather case and saw that it was filled with jewels . We closed it immediately . The wreck was not our private toy . "
