Europe 's fabled Orient Express returns in pristine splendor <P> It was known in its gilded heyday as the train of kings . It also transported in regal splendor diplomats , divas and duchesses , the beau monde and the demimonde , maharajahs , moguls and con men , courtesans , couriers , private eyes and spies . Thundering across empires to the edge of Asia , the Orient Express was the most celebrated train in history . It retired ignobly in May 1977 , aged 94 , a shrunken outcast of the hurry-up age . Then , last May , it rose again in all its pristine opulence as a regularly scheduled year-round train luxe , plying between London and Venice . The once and future train is called the Venice Simplon Orient-Express ( V.S.O.E. ) . Among recent passengers on both the south-and northbound runs was TIME Senior Writer Michael Demurest , who once rode the fabled express as a boy . His report : <P> " To board this train , " intoned James I B. Sherwood , " should be an event . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're not , thanks largely to Sherwood , 49 , a big blue-eyed Kentuckian who heads London-based Sea Containers Group . It is this profitable containerized shipping company ( 1981 earnings : $35.4 million ) that owns and operates the new venture , having acquired and refurbished 35 old Orient Express cars over five years at a cost of $20 million . To emphasize the special nature of the inaugural run last spring , for example , passengers were encouraged to wear ' 20s finery , and many did so . On current trips , passengers often don evening clothes for dinner , and the champagne , a special V.S.O.E. label bottled by Laurent Perrier , flows freely . And as Sherwood has promised , " The bar-salon stays open , and our pianist plays on , until the last guest has retired . " " When a Broadway baby says good night , " plunks Giany Bars at the baby grand piano , " it 's early in the morning . " <P> On the 24-hour , 926-mile London-to-Venice trip , the train leaves Victoria Station at 11:44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves Venice 's Santa Lucia Station at 5:25 p.m. on Saturday and Wednesday . The English segment of the train , which does not cross the channel , consists of seven chocolate-and-cream cars that were built for the old Orient Express . They have comfortable English names like Audrey and Agatha ( not for Miss Christie , who wrote Murder on the Orient Express ) or else daunting classical appellations like Perseus and Phoenix . Some English passengers are greeted by name at Victoria by brown-liveried Brian Hannaford , an oldtime Pullman chief steward who has also been restored to service . <P> Rolling through the viridian Kentish countryside , there is time for a leisurely lunch , a free , staunchly English repast designed perhaps to fortify tender turns against the Gallic frivolities to follow . At Folkestone , passengers board a reserved veranda deck on the Sealink cross-channel ferry . In 90 minutes passengers are ashore at the great French port of Boulogne .
