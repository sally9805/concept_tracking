TIME 's design and format have steadily evolved to meet changing journalistic needs . New sections are created , obsolete ones dropped and innovations like the Notes pages added . In this issue , the Economy &; Business section introduces a new format to be used occasionally , as the news dictates . Shorter than a full-scale cover treatment but longer and less bound by the week 's events than a regular lead story , the Economy &; Business Special Reports will treat large subjects with an introductory survey , followed by separate stories examining various themes . Explains Senior Editor Charles Alexander , who oversaw this week 's Special Report on the auto industry : " This format makes a broad subject easier to comprehend and allows us to approach it from different perspectives . " <P> The search for a new story treatment began last August , when Detroit Bureau Chief William Mitchell suggested a major story on the realignments at General Motors . The idea was well received , but the editors also wanted to discuss other aspects of the business : the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's latest strategies . Enter the Special Report , a two-page overview of the U.S. automobile market in 1986 , followed by one-page stories on each of the Big Three . Mitchell provided the substance of the stories from Detroit by interviewing , among others , the chairmen of the three automakers . " I was struck , " he says , " by how much American and Japanese executives really are talking the same language these days . " <P> The new format required an innovative design . That was where Art Department Designer Johnny White and Picture Researcher Richard Boeth came in . For the past year the two have been working as a team to enliven the look of TIME 's business coverage . " Business often has to revisit the same story , like the auto industry or the stock market , " says White . " We have to discover new and dramatic ways to present stock images so that the reader will find them fresh . " Adds Boeth : " Wherever possible , we try to get business leaders out from behind their desks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company does , or tells us something about the person . We want the picture to illustrate the whole story . " For this week 's Special Report debut , White and Boeth devised new layouts combining photos , symbols and charts , and came up with new caption designs . At TIME , as elsewhere , form most often follows function .
