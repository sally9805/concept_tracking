 | She was , Ann remembered , as eager to make a good impression as Barbara was to be ingratiating . Yes , there was a certain indelibility about their first meeting , despite the confusing , information-packed grand tour . Barbara had given particularly detailed descriptions of every piece in the dining room . " Duncan Phyfe , " she said , rapping her knuckles on the shiny table . " Queen Anne chairs . And that rococo monstrosity is my favorite . " She had pointed to an elaborate candelabrum with room for more than a dozen candles . " Decadent , do n't you think ? " " I guess they knew things would outlive human beings , " Ann replied , patting a marble-top credenza for emphasis . At that first meeting , Barbara 's curvaceous figure was encased in tight jeans and a T-shirt on which the word HAUSFRAU was stretched tautly over ample bosom , intimidating the statement . She possessed , as a miner 's daughter like Ann would observe , Slavic good looks : deep-set hazel eyes , peering cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut hair was cut to cascade , like a wild brook , down either side of her head , almost to her broad shoulders , which served as a sturdy crosspiece for her magnificent bosom . " I 'm going pro , " Barbara had announced , as if it were necessary to explain the kitchen . She had flashed a wide , ingenuous smile , growing momentarily wistful . " Hell , I 've got the talent and the facilities . That 's for sure . " Her attention had suddenly departed from Ann , as if there were someone else she had to convince . But when her attention came back to Ann again , she explained that she had just sold a batch of her special cassoulet to an embassy in the neighborhood and her pate was becoming a staple at the French Market . " It 's just a humble beginning , " she had said . " But  | that 's why I need a little help with the kids . Just a watchful eye . A little tidying up . Perhaps some help for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard stuff . Teenagers need a maternal surrogate when Mom 's busy in the kitchen . " She laughed nervously , which , by inference , put Ann at ease , as if illustrating that she was n't the only one with anxieties about the new arrangement . As she talked , Ann remembered , she had lifted Mercedes , the spayed Siamese , from one of the upper open shelves , wedged between a can of Crisco and a box of brown sugar . The cat snuggled against her hair and briefly shared an Eskimo kiss before jumping to the floor , scurrying off to a sunny adjoining room that appeared to be filled with plants . " There 's an overgrown standard schnauzer , whose bark is worse than his bite , that you 'll meet shortly . He spends the day servicing the local bitches . Mostly , he obeys only Jonathan , who says that 's because they both share the same drives . " She had flashed her smile again and giggled a throaty , girlish laugh . The reference to men 's drives seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sisterly affection began to ferment . Ann 's confidence rose . The little exchange seemed to underline that first impression . Barbara had mentioned in passing that the schnauzer 's name was Benny , but it was Eve , their sixteenyear-old daughter , who had explained to Ann the notso-subtle connection . " Mercedes-Benz . Of course . I should have caught it immediately . " Ann had actually felt embarrassed . " No reason to , Ann , really . It 's just one of those very inside family things . It was Dad 's idea . " Reticence marked their first encounters . But Ann thought that was understandable , since the assignment of an au pair girl to watch over a sixteen-year-old  | seemed an insult by definition . Eve 's first move was to give Ann the shock treatment . " I keep my stash of pot behind Louisa May Alcott , " the girl explained as she introduced Ann to her room , the style of which was an obviously deliberate attempt on Eve 's part to stem the tide of antiques that had engulfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowery prints except for the pink bookcases and Andy Gibb poster . The inside of the closet was a mess and schoolbooks were scattered under the bed . " And I 'm on the pill , " she said , watching Ann 's face for a reaction . Ann 's features were calculatingly immobile . She herself was n't on the pill for two reasons , health and infrequency . She was n't shocked , although she had made a mental note as to how much lower the starting age was now . As if to buttress her rebel image , Eve offered Ann a cigarette , then lit up and inhaled deeply . " Screw cancer . " She shrugged . To Ann , the bravado was a dead giveaway . Eve was n't a brat at all . Just unsure , like most teenagers . . . and adults . " I do n't smoke , " Ann had replied . " I chew . " Eve 's giggle , like her mother 's , seemed to break the tension . " Really ? " Eve had exclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , vulnerable and gawky , still unfleshed and willowy , but with all the promise of inheriting her mother 's Slavic sensuousness . With her father 's blue eyes and rich , thick hair , she would soon be quite a beauty . To make it with Eve , Ann knew instinctively , was to find some important way to illustrate her trust in the girl . She detested being so calculating as she searched for opportunities . But it meant a great deal to win Eve 's favor , especially in practical terms . The job in the Roses ' household was a stroke of luck . Banishment , for  | whatever reason , would be a personal and financial disaster . The opportunity arose when Eve flunked math at Sidwell Friends School , a posh private school of Quaker origin for the children of the Washington elite . Eve , too frightened to tell her parents , confided the horror to Ann . " I 've disgraced them , " she cried . Calming her down , Ann agreed to act as go-between , a role not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barbara had been angry . " Lack of preparation is a curse , " she had snapped . " I know . " Ann had learned by then that Barbara had married at nineteen and had dropped out of college . " I promised them you 'd go to summer school if there were no recriminations or bad words , " Ann had announced proudly to Eve , who collapsed in shivery tears . In its way , it was a kind of victory and certainly represented a turning point between them . " I 'll make them proud , " Eve promised , her lips pursing in determination . There was , Ann had discovered , an invisible , fiercely competitive standard loose in the household . She wondered if it was a good thing . This standard was at its most obvious in twelveyear-old Josh . What he wanted most of all was to be a member of the Sidwell Friends junior-varsity basketball team . She heard his basketball rattling , with irritating punctuality , against the backboard that his father had made in the alley over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a well-made mixture of his parents ' genes : hazel eyes , cheekbones like his mother 's , and a space between nose and lip that would surely in late adolescence sprout his father 's thick mustache . His hair , sadly , was his mother 's chestnut , which meant that he might not grow his father 's salty , waved hair . Like Eve , he wore braces and it was a family joke , one  | of many , that the Roses were an orthodontist 's dream . Ann 's relationship with Josh started out vague and unpromising . She had barely any memories of prepubescent boys , having gone to a Catholic girls ' school . To the stern sisters of that establishment , young boys , if they existed at all , were messengers of Satan . To her , Josh was , nevertheless , a challenge to be surmounted . She found him one day hunched over his basketball on the third-floor landing outside her room . She had been studying and it was obvious when she saw him there , gloomy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon him " accidentally . " " You look like you just lost your best pal , " she had said , standing over him . He was holding the basketball in a tight embrace . He looked up at her , dry-eyed , but with a visible trembling of his lower lip that threatened the total collapse of his pseudo-manly courage . She sat down beside him , noting that he had deliberately left room for her on the step . " Damned coach , " he said , telescoping the message that he had n't made the team . It was enough of a signal to set her mind racing to find something reasonably reassuring to say . Providentially , the Johnstown house was on the edge of a school attended mostly by black children . " Any black kids on the team ? " she asked . He held up one finger . " Get a chance to play with any black kids ? " He shrugged , obviously having no idea where she was leading him . " Go to the schoolyards where the black kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings around those lily-white honkies . " He took the advice , still sulking as he brushed aside her attempted caress of his shoulders . It was weeks later , when he suddenly broke out in black street talk , that  | she knew he had taken her advice . Pure chance , she had decided , but a definite icebreaker . The sun was barely visible through the arborvitaes and would soon be hidden behind the cedar fence , leaving a soft hush in the air . From the kitchen two floors below , exotic , mouth-watering odors wafted upward . In the oven , Ann knew , was a crusting cassoulet , layers of simmering goose , pork , lamb , and sausage on a bed of flageolets , bubbling in an essence of garlic , thyme , bay leaves , and other glorious herbs and spices . Cooling on the marble of the kitchen island was , a deep sniff confirmed , a loaf of fluffy banana bread . Barbara was at that moment probably mixing a light salad of greens and mushrooms in the big wooden bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There would be sliced pate de campagne as well and a chocolate mousse to sweeten the celebration . God 's in his heaven and all 's right with the world , Ann thought , prompted by the smells and the delicious knowledge of her treasure chest of family secrets . The festivities were Barbara 's original idea to celebrate Eve 's summer-school victory , a B-minus in advanced algebra . Ann had spent half the summer sweating over that one with Eve , certain that her effort had lifted the grade by one whole letter jump . And Jonathan had embroidered the victory with his own contribution . He had bought Eve a silver Honda , which , unbeknown to the victorious scholar , lay in wait in the garage next to his prized Ferrari , rarely used but fondled and caressed like a precious baby . " You must n't breathe a word , " Jonathan had warned . " Not a word . " Barbara had come to her that morning with two secrets .  | " Josh made the team . But do n't tell Jonathan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . " " You said two secrets . " " I just got a hell of an order . Chicken galantine for twenty-four . For the Paks . They 're entertaining the French ambassador Tuesday night . Just do n't tell Jonathan . Let it be my surprise . " Barbara took Ann by the shoulders , looking deeply into her eyes as if they were a mirror . " You know , I 'm going to make it big as a caterer someday . I mean big . " Eve came into her room sometime later with a further announcement and Ann literally had to turn away to hide her amusement . " You might think this dinner is for my B-minus , but Dad 's got a topper to that . The firm picked up one of those big Fortune Five Hundred clients in New York . But do n't tell Mom . He 's going to break out the Chateau Lafite-Rothschild ' 59 . When he does that , we 're into heavy duty . " Any more secrets and Ann was certain that she would burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . She had her little secret , too , reminded of it again as she passed Jonathan on the back stairs . He had just come from the sauna that he had built in the basement , complete with adjoining shower . Sometimes the family gathered there . Nakedness was not a hang-up , although in deference to Ann they no longer went about the house without robes , another secret that Josh had confided . Passing him on the stairs , she turned quickly away as her eyes caught a tantalizing picture . The damp had curled his hair and the terry-cloth V showed a profusion of jet-black body turf down to his navel . She could not bring herself to look below that but she could not ignore the piny scent that his skin exuded , embellishing  | the exciting aroma of his maleness . Passing him this close , with him in a state of semiundress , was dizzying . " Soon , " he said , winking as he passed her . " I 'm going to give Eve the Honda keys at dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet at-home dress with a single strand of matched pearls and even Eve had parted for once from her jeans and was wearing a more fitting , preppyish outfit of pleated skirt , blouse , and saddle shoes . As always , when it came to clothes , Ann felt inadequate , despite the fact that she wore one of Barbara 's beige slack-suit hand-medowns , a far cry from the J. C. Penney polyester she had worn that first day . As if by silent consent , Ann picked up the cooling banana bread and joined the procession to the library , which doubled as a kind of family den . They moved through the marble-floored foyer , over which glistened a huge crystal chandelier , hanging three stories high in a brass-banistered stairwell . From the foyer 's corner , a tall clock in an inlaid-mahogany case offered seven chimes to underscore the Roman hour on its dial . Jonathan had built the walnut bookshelves in the library to hold their rows of leather-bound old books . Against a blank wall was a huge , carved nineteenth-century armoire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now held an assortment of liquor . On the fireplace mantel was an array of Staffordshire figures . The Staffordshire collection was Jonathan 's pride and there were more than fifty figures scattered around the house  --  milkmaids , sailors , Napoleons , Garibaldis , Little Red Riding Hoods , and crude , rosy-cheeked farm boys . On a marble table in the foyer were displayed what had become the legendary Cribb and Molineaux , poised in their eternal pugilistic confrontation . The story of  | the Roses ' first meeting had been repeated in the household ad infinitum . Over the library fireplace hung a large English oil , a hunting scene , appropriate to the leather Chesterfield couch and matching chairs in front of it . It was , Barbara admitted , a mishmash room , but perfect for squatting around a heavy , low oak " rent table , " on a Sarouk blue-and-red Persian rug , to have Sunday dinners . " It seems to be the only time we 're all together , " Barbara had told her , offering a mysterious , wistful look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , with Josh trailing smugly behind , the platters of cassoulet and pate and the big wooden salad bowl had been laid out . An unsuspecting Eve picked at the banana bread and dropped little morsels in her mouth , unaware of the impending surprise . The family squatted around the table while Jonathan , with great ceremony , poured the Lafite-Rothschild ' 59 into crystal wineglasses . He looked about , offering a cryptic smile , winking at Barbara and lifting his glass . " Before we dine on this magnificent repast , " he said , savoring the arcane language , " we must toast this moment of triumph . " He looked at Eve , who smiled broadly , two rougelike puffs of excitement on each apple cheekbone . " B-minus will not an A make , but it 's a hell of a long way from F. " Josh snickered . He always brought home straight A 's and was not above teasing his sister on this score . " And a longer way from H. " " H ? " Eve asked , squinting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Honda ? " Eve looked at the faces around the table in confusion . Jonathan raised his glass higher and from  | his pocket drew out a set of keys and his electronic remote-control garage opener . " Just do n't hit the Ferrari on your way out . " " Not if you value your life , " Barbara joked . Eve squealed with hysterical joy , grabbing her father around the neck , kissing him with passionate gratefulness . She repeated the ritual with Barbara , then with Josh and Ann , finally picking up the keys and garagedoor opener and dashing out toward the rear of the house . " We 're spoiling her rotten , " Jonathan said when she had gone , bringing the rim of the wineglass to his lips . Everyone followed suit . " But it feels so damned good . " " We did n't get our first car until three years after we were married , " Barbara said . " Different times . " Jonathan shrugged . " Why all the hard work if not for this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gesture taking in all the visible surroundings , including the people . " I made the team , " Josh said suddenly , as if a bubble had suddenly burst inside him . " Damn , " Jonathan said , putting down his glass and slapping hands in black-jock fashion . " Bad . Man . " He had picked up some of the jargon from Josh . " I 'll drink to that , " Josh said , lifting his glass and swilling down the expensive wine as if it were CocaCola . They heard the horn blasts of Eve 's new Honda , which she had driven around to the front of the house . Gathering at the window , the family waved and Eve sped off in a cloud of carbon monoxide . " Lucky bitch , " Josh said . " Well , now it makes it obligatory for you when you hit sixteen , " Jonathan said . " You now have a standard .  | That 's what fatherhood means . Setting standards . " He laughed at his own little joke , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other family victories to announce , " Barbara said quietly , her eyes smiling in their deep sockets , her full lips curling tremulously over her white teeth . She made her announcement in a flat , somewhat restrained tone , but with a determined flourish . There seemed a disturbing note of bravado in it as well , although Ann felt she was the only one who appeared to notice . Jonathan moved closer to Barbara and kissed her on the lips . " Fantastic , " he said as Ann quickly turned away , annoyed at her sudden burst of jealousy . " I guess what I have to say is anticlimactic , " Jonathan said just as Eve burst through the front door , flushed with joy . " It runs like a dream . Like a dream , " she cried , squatting beside Ann and squeezing her hand . " I 'm so happy . " Ann lifted a finger to Eve , in mock rebuke , as Jonathan continued . " Just a new client . More lucre for the family coffers . A huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm off to New York tomorrow to seal the deal . " They exchanged more kisses and soon everybody was digging into the feast , mumbling ecstatically , with full mouths , over Barbara 's wonderful cookery , embellished , they all agreed , by the rich taste and bouquet of the ' 59 Lafite-Rothschild . Watching them in what she could only characterize as their splendor , Ann could not escape the comparison with her own shabby family , locked in the prison of their tiny wood-frame house in Johnstown . More like Dogpatch , she thought , where the big treat was snaring  | Polish sausages with a bent fork from a big jug and swilling down six-packs . The rich cassoulet melted in her mouth as the movie in her mind froze into a single ghastly frame . In it , her mother 's swollen body squirmed like jelly in a torn , flowered housecoat as she reclined on a sprung , worn couch in front of the television set , gun-muzzle curlers poised to shoot out Laverne and Shirley , while her father , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added cigar-ash dust to the frayed carpet from which sprouted his Archie Bunker chair . Suddenly , as if to start the reel moving again , she tapped her wineglass with a silver spoon , the tinkling crystal forcing the silence . " I ca n't tell you how much . . . " The words stuck in her throat and she had to clear it and begin again . " I ca n't tell you how much it has meant to me to be here with you . You can not imagine . . . " She stumbled again , the images of her past life too vivid for the rush of words . Her gaze washed over each face , even Jonathan 's , which , surprisingly , she viewed without the earlier shame . " It 's been the most wonderful time of my life . The way you 've taken me in and become , for me , my family . " She swallowed hard to hold down a ball of phlegm . " Such a happy family ... " She shook her head , too overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of the glass , which she tipped , sipping the wine . What a happy house , she thought , wondering how she had had the good luck to find them .  | Jonathan felt the first stab of pain just as Mr. Larabee finished talking , a familiarization lecture , really , outlining the company 's special problem with the Federal Trade Commission . He had been taking notes on a lined yellow legal pad and now the pencil made jiggling swirls as if it were writing independently . They were sitting around a conference table in the chairman 's office in Manhattan and he 'd already had more cups of coffee before lunch than was his custom . At first he tried to dismiss the pain , but when he began to break into a cold sweat , a charge of panic gripped him and he put down his pencil and tried to cover up his discomfort with a cough . Then the chairman began to direct his remarks to Jonathan , and the words sounded muffled , incoherent , and far away . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the abysmal predicament . It was everybody 's dread to be struck down suddenly in the middle of some important event . Bladder and bowels would void . There would be vomiting and , worst of all , he would be inconveniencing everybody around him , all of whom could n't care less . And there was the perennial joke  | about clean underwear just in case , but that usually applied to women . " You feel all right , Rose ? " the chairman asked . Jonathan managed a nod but knew it was unconvincing . Someone poured him a glass of water from a silver pitcher , but he could n't get it down . " This is ridiculous , " he whispered . He was led to a leather couch , and he lay down and managed to open his collar and loosen his tie . " I 'm sure it will pass , " he croaked . That , too , seemed unconvincing . The stabs of pain were becoming an onslaught behind his breastbone . " His color stinks , " someone said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ice . " He heard someone say " ambulance , " and realized suddenly that his sensory powers were becoming numb . His heart seemed ready to break out of his rib cage . His mind raced back and forth in time and memory and he wondered if he was the proverbial drowning man watching his life pass across his mind like a film in quadruple time . " This is stupid , " he heard himself say , knowing that the words had not been spoken . " You 'll be fine , " Larabee said unctuously . Jonathan had detested the man immediately and resented his concern . I 'm only forty , he thought as panic turned to pity , directed inward . He prayed he would n't soil his pants , remembering old admonitions from his childhood . There they were , the first signs . What galled him , too , was the lack of planning , and he wondered if he had paid all his insurance premiums . If you died at forty , your family would get a million , the insurance man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , choosing term instead of whole life .  | How can I die ? he thought . My parents are still living . My grandparents on both sides died in their eighties . Then he counted all the people he would be letting down and that only increased his panic and he wondered if he would soon lose consciousness . He lost track of time as he lay there . Someone covered him with a blanket but he still felt icy . " You 'll be fine , " the chairman said , his jowly face flushed with either concern or annoyance . I 've blown the first big interview with a new law client , Jonathan thought , imagining the reaction of his colleagues in the firm . Poor old Jonathan . Sorry son of a bitch . Two antiseptic-smelling , white-jacketed attendants lifted him to a wheeled stretcher , and he saw the oxygen mask coming quickly toward him . He also saw his own finger crooking in front of his eyes , beckoning . Larabee 's face came closer . " Call my wife , " Jonathan croaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he felt the motion of moving wheels , then the swirl of outdoor sounds and the ear-splitting siren as the ambulance shot forward . An icy stethoscope startled his suddenly bared chest . " Who knows ? " a voice said as the stethoscope was lifted . " Am I going to die ? " he whispered futilely into his mask . He burped and for a moment felt incredibly relieved until the pain started again . His mind had momentarily cleared , then he felt insular again as he pictured Barbara 's tearstained face , and Eve 's and Josh 's , hovering over him , waiting for the exact moment of demise , a deathwatch . I 've let them down , he rebuked himself . A flood of letdowns careened down the spillway of his anxiety-ridden mind . Who would feed Benny ? Who would turn the wine , care for the orchids , wind the tall mahogany clock ? Who would repair the broken appli-  | ances , watch over the antiques , the paintings , the Staffordshire figures ? And who would tune up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his possessions ? The idea was almost as unbearable as the pain . He felt a pinprick in his arm and soon the pain eased somewhat , and he was floating in space , like an astronaut in a space capsule . Some horrible nightmare nudged at his consciousness . But he could n't remember it , only that it was horrible . Then he sensed the ground moving under him as the wheels bumped along a corridor . Above him , the ceiling was lined with fluorescent white lights . The glare hurt his eyes . When they removed the oxygen mask , he whispered again . " Call my wife . Call Barbara . " Vaguely , he could feel them hooking him up to something and , in the distance , he heard a rhythmical blipping and unfamiliar sounds . Nearby , he could make out whispered voices hovering somewhere in space . If they could get to Barbara in time , he knew that everything would be fine . His life depended on Barbara . He would not die if Barbara came .  | When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady blip and ping of odd sounds , as if he were inside some huge clock , perhaps in the tall mahogany case in his foyer , the pendulum banging in his ears , the complicated works clanking in his head . Memory came and faded . They were on their honeymoon at the Groton Inn , an old , rickety colonial leftover . The dining room always seemed set for tea . It was too hot for June . The sun baked through the roof and making love was a gritty , unsatisfactory business . She had n't turned on , not the way she had before they were married , but he had attributed that to the tensions of the wedding , which had been opposed by both sets of parents . He still had two years to go at Harvard Law and she was two years from a degree at Boston University . " I 'll work my way through , " he had told his parents on that nasty spring day on which he had made the dreaded announcement . It was n't that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him inhibiting his career by marrying a poor nineteenyear-old girl , saddling himself with responsibility .  | " But I love her , " he had protested with surety , as if the words were all that was needed to explain such a radical change in his life . He supposed it was their humdrum married life and their exaggerated dreams for him that prompted their opposition and he was gentle with them . A state employee 's ambition for his only son was no fragile thing . " I wo n't let you down , " he had promised , knowing how hard the money for his education had come . " But I ca n't live a single minute more without her . " It was 1961 , before all the revolutions , and living together without benefit of legal marriage was still a few years away . " You 're crazy , " his father had said . His mother had simply sat at the kitchen table , hands folded , head bent , and cried . " And I do n't expect you to pay my tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own now . " He hesitated . " With Barbara . " " Between us , we can make it , " Barbara had assured him . It had struck her parents even harder , since they were both high-school teachers , and the prospect of her dropping her education appalled them . " I love him , " she had told them . It was still a time when those three little words were glorified as the highest of attainments . To be in love was all . They were , as the saying goes , moonstruck . All he wanted , he remembered , was to touch her , to smell her , to hear her voice . " I love you more than anything else in the world , " he told her , repetitively , holding her . He was always holding her . " I would die for you , Jonathan , " she had sworn . Die ? His mind cleared with an explosive start . He could not understand why he was thinking about this , lying there in the darkened room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight cover sheet , showing its outline . Well , I 'm not dead yet , he thought , discovering also that the pain was gone . The sedatives or whatever he had been given had made him headachy and drowsy and he hovered in a kind of half-sleep , hearing the voices of professionals exchanging bits of medical information , which , he assumed , were about his own mysterious carcass . At any moment he expected to hear Barbara 's heels clicking down the corridor and to feel her cool , soothing touch . For some reason he began thinking about the Louis vitrine cabinet of inlaid tulipwood with its original beveled glass and ornate mounts , signed by Linke , which he had been tempted to buy . It was Barbara who had restrained him and he had argued with her . All the logic was on her side . " We have n't the room , " she had protested , holding his arm , which twitched as the auctioneer watched his face . " But it 's gorgeous . " " The house is finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he remembered that the idea of that disturbed him for weeks . Finished ? They had been fooling with it for more than ten years , ever since they fell in love with its somewhat seedy facade on its high vantage point overlooking Rock Creek Park , with a magnificent view of the tall , graceful arches of the Calvert Street Bridge . Besides , it was the best neighborhood in town , and in Washington a man was known by his neighborhood . For years the house had , like quicksand , sucked up every spare sou as they redid its ramshackle interior , room by room . He dozed fitfully , sensing a moving stretcher , and an endless line of fluorescent lights marching along the ceiling .  | " We 're going to X-ray , " a black attendant explained . Jonathan heard him talking about a ball game in the elevator . Perhaps , he thought , visitors were deliberately being kept from him , and Barbara , nervous and tearstained , was sitting in some lounge , waiting for the results of tests . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fearful of the answer , he did n't ask . He started worrying about his cymbidium orchids , which he had proudly coaxed from their indoor pot beds with loving care and which were now on their way to maturity beside Barbara 's hanging forest and clusters of potted African violets and Boston ferns in the sunroom . It had been a challenge to try his hand at such delicate plants . He also began to worry about Benny , the schnauzer to which he was a deity , proving his obeisance with great delight . Neither Barbara nor the kids could handle him . The tools , too , required maintenance , and the garden . Then there was Barbara 's kitchen ... . God , do n't kill me off yet , he cried within himself . He was lifted onto a cold , metal X-ray table and rotated like a chicken on a spit . A white-smocked technician poked at him in a businesslike way , and he heard an intermittent buzz , which , in his clearing mind , he assumed was the sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered , noting that a clock on the wall read twelve . " What day is it ? " " Wednesday , " the technician answered . Later they brought him back to another room , where he was isolated by a screen . They did not hook him up to any mechanical devices , and he noted that his arms and buttocks tingled , apparently from needle pricks . He slept some more , then was awakened gently by the touch of a cool hand . Blinking his eyes open , he peered into a bespectacled pinkish face .  | " You 're a lucky bastard , Mr. Rose . " " I 'm not dying ? " he whispered . " Hardly . It 's your hiatus hernia . Quite common , really . We thought it was a heart attack and took all the precautionary measures . You had one hell of a gas pain . It sometimes simulates an attack . " He pushed himself up , feeling a sense of renewed life . " So I 'm born again , " he snapped , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lingering hurt in his chest . " You never died . " " Yeah . A lot of people will be disappointed . I 'll be the laughingstock of the firm . " He swung his legs over the bed . " Tell my wife to come in and get me the hell out of here . " He looked at the doctor . " No offense , but if all you can do is come up with a gas pain , you should close up shop . " The doctor laughed . " I just talked to your wife and gave her the good news . " " She 's not here ? " " It would have been for naught , " the doctor said . " I suppose ... " Jonathan said , checking himself . He was entitled to feel insecure . They brought him his clothes , wallet , keys , money , and briefcase , and he dressed , still feeling shaky . In the hospital lobby he went into a phone booth and called home . " Oh , Jonathan . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He formed a quick mental picture of her , wheatish hair , light freckles , round face , with a smile that set off deep dimples .

" Barbara 's just left . She 'll be back in a little while . She 's been quite busy on the Pakistan Embassy order . " She hesitated , as if she were debating something more . But nothing came . He was disappointed . " I 'm going to see my client here . But I 'll definitely be home tonight . Are the kids okay ? " " Worried sick . I called them at school after the doctor called . " " Super . " He was about to offer the closing amenities and hang up . " Ann , " he said , " when did they call Barbara ? The first time . . . I mean . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember I answered the phone . Barbara was very disturbed . " He felt the stab of pain again , but it passed quickly , no longer worrying him . " Well , then . . . " He seemed suddenly disoriented , troubled as if by a chess move that he could not dope out , knowing the answer was there . " Just tell her I 'll be home for dinner . " After he hung up , he looked mutely at the phone box , still trying to understand the vague sense of loss . To put it out of his mind , he called Larabee . " You gave us quite a scare , " Larabee said . He remembered the unctuousness and the " just fine " admonitions . It annoyed him to know the man had been right all along . " You called it , " Jonathan said , irritated at his own attempt at ingratiation . But he could not shake the notion that his display of vulnerability , notwithstanding that it was beyond his control , had somehow spoiled his image . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt the gorge of his own rhetoric rising , and , as if in counterpoint , a burp bubbled out of his chest and into the mouthpiece.  | " Hello . . . " Larabee said . " Must be a bad connection , " Jonathan said , feeling better psychologically as well . Later , he came away from the chairman 's office with the feeling that he had restored some measure of confidence again , shutting off allusions to his indisposition with quick , almost impolite dispatch . " Even the doctors felt stupid for making such a fuss , " he lied , closing the subject once and for all . But on the plane his ordeal reopened itself in his mind and he found himself making doodles on his yellow pad , watching the changing light of a sunset in an incredibly blue sky . What was nagging at him since being discharged was the lingering sense of utter desolation , of total aloneness . He also felt more fear now than when he was in the hospital . It was beyond logic . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuratively , from the jaws of death . Then why the depression ? Why the loneliness ? What was wrong ? " Call my wife , " he had whispered to someone . In his memory the words resurfaced as a plea , a drowning man shouting for help . His imagination reversed the roles and he saw himself panicked and hysterical as he dropped everything to fight his way toward Barbara . The images were jumbled . He saw himself swimming through choppy seas , slogging over shifting desert dunes , climbing upward over jagged rocks , a panorama of heroic acts , just to be near her . Then the fantasy exploded , leaving him empty , betrayed . How dare she not come to his deathbed ?  | Why had she not come ? Barbara asked herself , smirking at her inadvertent double entendre . The boning knife , working in her hand by rote , carefully separated the chicken skin from the neck bone , a crucial step in achieving a perfect boning job . This was her fourth chicken-boning operation that afternoon and her mind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she had little control of her thoughts . She did not often think about sex and was surprised that the subject surfaced in her mind . He made love to her tenderly , fervently , but lit no fires in her . She was always dutiful , enduring what had become for her a dreary process , barely remembering when such contortions and gymnastics had ever brought her pleasure . He was not , she knew , oblivious of this indifference despite her Academy Award performances . " Even when it 's not so good , it 's pretty great , " he told her often , usually after he had calmed from a panting , shivery episode of obvious and sometimes noisy personal pleasure . " It 's there to enjoy , my son , " she had responded ,  | hiding her disappointment behind the light humor . Wisecracks were great truth-hiders . She had n't really understood her sexual indifference , especially since she was once a firecracker as far as he was concerned . But that was long ago . Then , before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to feel all the pops begin inside her . For years , when considering their marriage , she had toted up lists of pros and cons . Sex had become one of the cons , although she did not blame him wholly for her odd lack of response . Something had changed in their chemistry , she decided . After all , it took two to tango . Secretly she knew she was excitable and could occasionally summon up fantasies and with a little digital manipulation was able to coax out a reasonable response . But she detested even thinking about that . The list of pros was formidable and , in her mind , she saw the items actually crawl off the page . He had become a fantastic money earner . Two hundred thousand a year . Not bad for a bureaucrat 's son . She was damned proud of him for that . And there was the house . It was to his credit that he had seen the possibilities instantly . The neighborhood , Kalorama , tucked behind famed Embassy Row , was , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full maturity , surrounding homes built earlier in the century for the then elite of the capital . Foreign governments had grabbed up the largest homes for embassies and legations . But Kalorama Circle was the diadem of the neighborhood , especially on its Rock Creek side , a clifflike perch looking downward into what in summer and spring was a lush valley . Frorn the front of the house was the unobstructed view of the lovely Calvert Street Bridge , with its graceful arches and fluted columns topped by heroic eagles . It was certainly a  | great pleasure to the eye , notwithstanding the fact that it was a favorite jumping point for despondent suicides . At the time they bought it the house was extremely run down , but the outlines of its French-chateau architecture were in perfect scale , and a coat of white paint on the smooth stucco and the addition of shutters that actually closed and were painted black did wonders for the facade . The double front doors were stripped and finished with a matching black stain and fitted with gold knobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were replaced with elaborate crownshaped ones topped with complicated embroidered fretwork . With its high windows on the ground floor , the ornamental wrought iron below the sills of the second , and the dormers built into the rustic slate tile of the third  --  all windows were sixteen lights  --  the house exceeded even their own high expectations . They were so delighted with its looks they had a copperplate engraving made of it , which they sent out each Christmas . The house , after all , was them . Collecting antiques was a joint passion and their weekends were taken up by sorties to auction houses or with combing the old Virginia and Maryland homesteads searching , with a canny eye , for a bargain . Most of their European vacations were devoted to this activity and sprinkled among the furnishings and accessories were memories of each trip , which , in time , became part of the mystique of their collection . Considering the way they had met , collecting antiques seemed a natural extension of their married life , as if they were acting out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . Her mother had been an excellent cook , and she had learned a great deal working for professional cooks and  | bakers on her summer vacations . As the kids demanded less of her time she began to harbor vaguely commerical ideas . There was , she knew , a sense of inadequacy fermenting inside her , although she consciously resisted seeing herself as the traditional woman , which , she thought , was a cruel label hung on some females by their more zealous sisters . She had designed the kitchen with a commercial idea in mind . Jonathan was enormously supportive , although she was never quite sure whether he was merely patronizing her or really believed in her ability to make it as a caterer . Nevertheless , he threw himself into the idea with vigor , devoting his weekends to every aspect of the kitchen 's construction . With his knowledge of electric circuitry and craftsmanship , he gave the contractors a fit . She , in self-defense , learned to decipher much of the background mysteries about how things worked and had even become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease traps , and repairing the garbage disposal . One Christmas he had even given her her own tool chest . For years he had taught her how to use them in his own basement work1I shop and she had helped him build the sauna and the adjoining shower , done without the help of a contractor . They had also restripped and finished some of their antique furniture together . As an upwardly mobile lawyer building his law practice , he traveled frequently , but managed to keep his weekends reasonably sacrosanct . The house , they both knew , enclosed the real limits of their world and they sought out things connected with the house that they could do together . Like indoor gardening , although their interests splintered eventually as he began to cultivate orchids and she continued with her Boston ferns and African violets .  | The pro side was , indeed , considerable . They had tried to get the children to share their interests but their lives , it seemed , were on another tack , although both parents believed that the exposure would stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pros as well . He was intelligent , attractive , articulate , humorous , with a wide variety of intellectual , as well as material , interests . And she did bask in the joy of his colleagues ' and clients ' approval , despite the occasional jealous bitchiness of their wives . So , then , she asked herself  --  or was the question directed to the chicken whose skin she now rolled away from the carcass as if it were a sweater ? ? why did I not come ? She detached the lower part of the main wing bone with shears so that the lower end of the bone would slide along with the skin . Then , carefully , she began to detach the fibers from the carcass . When the skin reached the middle part of the drumstick , she severed the bone and detached the skin , repeating the operation on the other drumstick . The tail came off with the whole skin and she snipped it free with the shears . Satisfied with her handiwork , she flattened the skin on the cutting board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she banged it flat with the side of a cleaver . " Because I did n't give a damn , " she cried out to the chicken 's denuded carcass . She felt a ball of anger growing inside her , swirling about for definition , detesting its inarticulateness . She searched her mind for reasons . " I must have reasons , " she whispered as the anger burst into the reality of the kitchen and she banged the pointy edge of the cleaver into the wooden cutting surface , scarring it irrevocably . What she really wanted after she had received the  | first call from the hospital was for him to die . That was the absolute truth of it . She wanted him to expire , to be eliminated from her life as painlessly as possible , extracted like a rotten tooth . Jonathan dead ? The idea frightened her and she shuddered . Surely the thought was an aberration . To wish him dead implied hatred . Hatred ? Such a response seemed inhuman . She swallowed hard and her body shook . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , hoped he would die .  | onathan barely remembered the cab journey over Memorial Bridge , the swing around Lincoln Memorial , past the State Department , around Washington Circle . All these landmarks passed in front of him like indistinct photographs . Ann had apparently been watching from a front window and opened the door before he inserted his key . The mahogany clock in the hallway read two minutes to six , he noted as he dropped his briefcase on the marble floor . Even in his semiconscious drugged state in the hospital , he remembered , he had heard the chimes in his mind like ancient echoes . " Josh is at basketball practice . Eve is at her ballet class . Barbara is delivering an order of pate . " There was a note of apology in her tone and her face searched his , betraying anxiety . " I 'm fine , " he said . " Perhaps I look a little pale . " " A little . " He walked back to the sun-room to see his orchids , which , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the root , which was still damp . " Not to worry . Daddy 's home , " he whispered to the flowers .  | He went up to his bedroom , undressed , debated whether or not to use the sauna , then opted for a long hot shower instead . For some reason he felt the need to shock himself , hoping it might chase the depression . He turned off the hot water and turned on the cold . His skin tingled and for a moment he had to catch his breath , but the pain did not return , and he wondered if he missed it , like an old friend . Barbara burst into the bathroom as he toweled himself , and kissed him on the lips . He drew her to him and enclosed her against his damp body . " It scared the shit out of me , " he whispered into her chestnut hair , stifling a sob . The warmth of her was reassuring . " It must have been awful , " she said , insinuating herself out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blouse , which she unbuttoned now . Watching her , he noted that she studied her face in the bathroom mirror , throwing back an errant strand of hair . " I 'm fine now , " he said to her image in the mirror . Running the gold-plated taps , she dipped her face into scoops of lukewarm water . He studied the ridgeline of her spine , wanting to trace his fingers over its peaks and loops . Slipping into his velour robe , he moved back into the bedroom and sank into a bergere chaise , lifting his bare feet to caress the curled wood . From there he could ' ' ll not see her , but he could hear her moving about , then came the rush of water and the cascaded flush . She walked out , wrapped in a terry-cloth robe . He was n't , he realized , simply observing her as he did frequently . He was inspecting her , noting that the years had been kind to her willowy body . Her legs and thighs were still tight and youthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight had begun to bring them lower than when he had first seen them . He felt the urge to touch her , and there was a brief hard-  | ening in his crotch , but she seemed self-absorbed , her mind elsewhere . " You 'd be proud of me , Jonathan . I sold the Ecuadorans a weekly package . Next week my chicken galantine . After that my cassoulet . And , of course , my pate de campagne . " He was always supportive , and he was surprised that he could not concentrate on what she was telling him . She had moved to her Queen Anne dressing table and began brushing her hair . Still she seemed elusive , like a stranger . " I thought I was checking out , " he said , turning his eyes to their lacy bedspread with its battery of high pillows against the carved headboard . Dominating one wall was a high chest of drawers with an elaborately carved bonnet in the rococo manner , which they had both stripped and finished . The drapes were not drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moving lights of the rush-hour cars crossing the Calvert Street Bridge . Between the windows was a Capucius secretaire , with its top open . Barbara used it as a working desk . On its surface was a picture of the four of them at the Grand Canyon , a color print with a blaze of orange painting the rear cliffs . On the walls were prints of slender Art Deco ladies , languorous and sensual . He looked at them , but they gave him no pleasure . Watching them , he felt the sense of emptiness begin again . " I ca n't understand why you did n't come , " he said , swallowing hard , talking to the pictures . So this was the elusive chess move , he discovered suddenly . He had cut to the heart of the matter . Although he did not see her , he knew she had turned toward him . " I was in constant telephone touch , " she said testily , with a hard edge to her voice . " They had no definite diagnosis until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , still not looking at her face . " They said your condition was stable . " " I was in pain . I thought I was dying . " " But you were n't . " " You could not have known that . " " Do n't get prosecutorial , Jonathan . " He allowed himself a long pause , surprised that his chest was free of pain , although his stomach seemed to have tightened . He burped and his breath tasted sour . He looked at her now . This time it was she who turned away . " If the situation were reversed , I 'd be there as quick as I could . " The display of his own vulnerability galled him . " But it was n't reversed , " she said , getting up and going to their dressing room . She emerged quickly in a long robe . " I 've got to see about dinner . The kids should be home soon . " " It 's your attitude , " he said . " I do n't understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . It was composed . Her hazel eyes scrutinized him calmly . He detected no outward signs of insecurity or lack of self-confidence . There was no tension or anxiety . To him now , her persona seemed reconstructed , different . " Maybe I 'm suffering from the **25;439;TOOLONG blues . " He sighed , acknowledging to himself this gesture of surrender , certain that it was a lie . " It 's just that . . . " He began to grope for words , uncommon for him . " When you 're on the edge of the abyss , you think everyone is writing you off . It 's a nasty feeling . " " I think you 're overreacting , Jonathan . " She started to move , but his voice recalled her . " I guess I just wanted reassurance . " He sighed , deliberately posturing . He was- surprised that he knew this . What he needed now was to be held , caressed . Per-  | haps like a baby at his mother 's breast . God damn it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barbara . " Believe me , Jonathan , " she began . " If I 'd thought it was something awful , I would have come . You know that . " What disturbed him now was that he felt she was trying to convince herself . He forced himself to obliterate the suggestion , stood up , and drew her toward him again . She did n't glide , hesitating before she moved . " You 're fine , " she whispered , embracing him without conviction . " That 's the bottom line . " It was an expression she had picked up from somewhere . Perhaps from him . It signaled an unrecognizable inner voice , warning him . Something in his world was awry , misplaced , out of focus . He was n't sure . " I 'm sorry , Barbara . I do n't understand . " She watched him , shrugged , then smiled . That , too , seemed hollow . Perhaps , he thought , the drugs had interfered with his receiving apparatus and were working hell on the emotions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An invisible antenna seemed to crackle in his head , confirming reception . " You 'll feel better after dinner , Jonathan . I 'm sure of that . " " Why should you feel so sure ? And me , so unsure ? " She shook her head and turned away , and he could hear her padding down the steps , going away . Was it for long ? he wondered .  | She was alone in the kitchen . Ann and the children were studying in their rooms . In the distance she heard Benny 's persistent , grating bark . It was sure to prompt a neighbor 's complaint . Mercedes lay asleep on one of the top kitchen shelves . Forcing her concentration , Barbara put the chicken flesh , neck , gizzard , hearts , livers , and bones into the large enamel stock pot already in place on the gas burner . She added water and salt and lit the burner , hearing the pop as the flame from the pilot light ignited the hissing gas from the burner ring . Wiping her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touching the cool marble of the serving credenza . She saw her image in the silver punch bowl , studying its distortion , considering whether the reflection were really her . Perhaps , she wondered , she was merely an ornament , as static as the silver candelabrum beside her with nothing behind the facade but history . She remembered her mother 's words suddenly , their tone of disappointment and rebuke when she had announced that she was quitting college to devote her-  | self to Jonathan . Ancient history , she thought with contempt . " Loving someone does n't mean you have to give up everything , " her mother had warned . " It 's just until he gets out of law school , " she had assured her . " But you need something for yourself . " She had been surprised at that , since she believed that her mother had worked out of financial necessity . " You have to understand what it means to love someone as much as I love Jonathan , " she had responded , as if that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they warned her of the transience of such emotions ? Nothing lasts except things . Her fingers traced the curled design of the elaborate candelabrum . Yet she was less angry with her mother for not pressing the point harder than she was with herself , deriding her stupid , utterly ignorant nineteen-year-old self . Love , she thought , remembering it now only as something that had tricked her . Love lies . Her earlier emotion returned , stronger than before . It was not as if she had wished that a healthy Jonathan would die . Certainly not . That would be cruel , immoral , and unthinkable . But since , as the first call from the doctor had indicated , he was gravely ill anyway , the unthinkable became ... well , thinkable . With a thought like that , she asked , how could one live with oneself ? And how could one live with Jona-than ? It was not the first time she had contemplated a life without her husband . The idea had been smoldering inside her for a long time . Perhaps from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinpoint the moment , since they were always so busy planning ahead , building ,  | growing children or plants , collecting antiques . Their life together seemed divided into projects . Supporting him through law school . Playing good wife to upwardly mobile public servant . Being especially nice to his senior law partners  --  the quintessential traditional spouse . Chunks of time devoted to being ingratiating . Making him a cozy oasis of a home , a place to restoke the fires . They had gone from tiny apartment to split level in the far-out suburbs . Then came car pools and dancing classes and more car pools and orthodontists . All that culminating in this . . . this giant , all-consuming , magnificent house project in which they had jointly poured every drop of their energy and fantasy . So what happens now that that is finished ? she asked herself , walking into the library , where he was reading the paper . It was a question that demanded an answer . And she had it ready . " I did n't come rushing to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I did n't care . " It was not precisely the answer to the question as posed . Yet it said it all . He looked up from The Washington Star , squinting over his half lenses . " Did n't care ? " He removed his glasses and balanced them on the Chesterfield 's leather arm . " I just did n't care , " she said clearly . " You mean it did n't matter if I lived or died ? " His fingers tapped a crossed thigh and his eyes had narrowed . " No , Jonathan . " " Are you serious ? " He seemed genuinely confused , and she thought of the millions of other women somewhere who had suddenly imparted this same truth . " Dead serious . Without doubt . I do n't care . I have n't cared for a long time . " She calmed herself , hav-  | ing determined that she must be both calm and cautious . " Just like that . " He snapped his fingers . " You dismiss a life . A relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just like that . " " Just like that . " She , too , snapped her fingers . No , she thought . It was n't at all just like that . She watched him grope for control . He stood up , opened the doors to the armoire , and poured himself a heavy scotch . He swallowed deep and hard . " I ca n't believe this , " he said after a long pause . " Believe it . " She was sitting in the matching Chesterfield chair , her back stiff , her fingers digging into the hollows just behind her knees . The Staffordshire figures seemed a live audience . He rubbed his chin and shook his head . " Is there someone else ? " His voice cracked and he cleared his throat . Apparently he had deliberately choked off a sob . " No . " " Do you want someone else ? " he asked quickly , and she sensed the trained lawyer 's mind emerging . " Maybe . " " Always be vague under cross-examination , " he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ? " he asked gently , obviously grasping at some shred of hope . " Not really . " " Then is it something I have n't done ? " She formed her reply carefully . " It has nothing to do with your conscious self , " she said softly . She watched his face as it mirrored his growing anger . " What the hell is that supposed to mean ? " he exploded . His anger was , she knew , unavoidable . She hoped he would n't cry . She did not want to show him  | how unmoved she would be . " It means , " she responded calmly , " that you have no control over the situation and probably no blame . it It 's me . " She paused , shrugged , and tightened the grip behind her knees . " I do n't believe I can stand the idea of living with you for another moment . As I said , it 's not your fault .... " He started to speak but she held up her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done consciously . " " Injuries ? " His voice shook . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I know . I wish I was more articulate . But you see I 've never had the training .... " " So that 's it , " he said , finding sarcasm . " You gave up your life for me . " " A part of it . " " I made you quit school . Made you a slave . " " In a way . " " And you 're  --  what is the cliche ? ? unfulfilled . " " That , too . " She sensed his rising contempt , steeling herself for what she knew was coming , had to come . " And the kids ? Do n't they have a say ? " " The kids will be fine . I have no desire to abdicate my responsibilities in that quarter . And , no , they do n't have a say . " " Jesus . " He squinted into her eyes . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not Barbara . Not the girl I married . " " Not her . I 'm sorry , Jonathan . Really sorry . I wish I could do it so it would n't hurt . " There was a long pause as he paced the room . Stopping , he turned away and looked blankly at the titles of the leather-bound books , then circled the rent table and finally went back to the armoire and poured himself an-  | other drink . He gestured with the bottle , offering a drink . Obviously he had no idea of what was supposed to come next . " No . Thank you , " she said politely . He shrugged and gulped down another drink , suddenly jabbing a finger below his breastbone . " This is playing hell with my hiatus hernia . " " Take a Maalox . " He sighed , grimaced , and breathed deeply , staring at her . " You 're a cold-blooded bitch . " " I 'm sorry if that 's your perception . " But the label made her uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cruel . " There is no easy way to do this , Jonathan . I 'm sorry . " Sorry ? " His lips trembled and she sensed that he was holding back more recriminations , making an effort to contain his anger . " I guess it 's an epidemic . All the girls of our generation with your checklist of unfulfilled dreams , lusts , and fantasies . We 've busted our asses to make you content . Now you shit on us . We gave you too damned much . . . . " His voice faded . She had expected that , too . Had gone over all the potential arguments . " So I guess you want a divorce ? " he asked . She nodded , " Yes . " " Not even a trial separation . Fini ? " " I told you how I feel , Jonathan . Why flagellate yourself ? " He shrugged , and a nerve began to palpitate in his jaw . " I thought I was doing one hell of a job . I thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't . " " It 's going to be a bother , " he said . " Life 's a bother . " " Do n't be so fucking philosophical , Barbara . " She stood up . What more was there to say ? Through her own pain , she felt bells of freedom ring in her head . Save yourself , the rhythm urged . She supposed he 'd move out in the morning .  | e did n't move out in the morning . He was too disoriented . To avoid another confrontation , he got out of the house at six , before anyone had risen , and slipped into the surprisingly nippy morning . He always walked to the office . He never took the Ferrari to work . Besides Barbara 's Ford station wagon , they did n't own another car except , of course , for Eve 's Honda . And whom could he trust with such a work of the automaker 's craft ? The Ferrari lay tucked in its cozy wrapper , in the garage , like a rare gem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , it gave him pleasure to know it was there , sweet-tuned and ready just in case . He took no pleasure in the knowledge today . He had n't slept . He was n't used to the high , canopied Chippendale bed in the spare room across the hall from their bedroom . It had looked so inviting and comfortable when they bought it . It was too high and too hard . They had furnished the room strictly for guests , with a beautiful Hepplewhite secretaire of figured satinwood decorated with marquetry , a mahogany dressing table , and a japanned commode . On the floor was a  | round Art Deco carpet and draperies that matched its beige field . The room , he decided , was too showy for comfort . From his tossing and turning , the sheets had bunched and parted from the mattress , which added to his discomfort . Yet he refused to straighten them out , perhaps out of some masochistic desire to be punished for his marital shortcomings , whatever they were . This phenomenon  --  it seemed the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his acquaintances . " She just upped and said , No more marriage . ' Like her whole persona had been transformed . Maybe it 's something chemical that happens as forty gets closer . " He had heard it said in a hundred different ways . " It 's endemic , " he decided , heading down Connecticut Avenue , almost at a jog , until , breathless , he found himself leaning against the fountain rim at DuPont Circle . It was there that the realization hit him . He was on the verge of starting a whole new life for which he was totally unprepared . And in lousy physical shape to boot , he thought , noting his labored breathing . Perhaps he would have been better off with a heart attack . Sometime near dawn he had run out of explanations , having traced his life with her from the moment he had first clapped eyes on her in the parlor of the rickBarker house in Chatham . Cribb and Molineaux . They had finally joined the two on their wedding night . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told him then . The story had worn well over the years , although in the darkness and his new circumstances , the punch line had lost its humor . Once , the auctioneer 's error had come from providence . Now , once again , it seemed merely stupid . If the pair had n't been broken , Jonathan might have been spared this .  | He had , Jonathan told himself , been a good and loving husband . He had nearly offered " faithful " to complete the triad but that would have discounted his two episodes with hookers during conventions in San Francisco and Las Vegas when the children were small . My God , she has everything she could possibly want , he had railed into the night , sapped finally by the exhaustion of his disorientation . What confused him most was that he had not been warned . Not a sign . He hated to be taken by surprise . " You look a mess , " one of his colleagues said to him cheerily as Jonathan passed his office in the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive . Jonathan had not wanted to be observed , since he knew his demeanor told his whole story . He had seen it a number of times himself , the unshaven , abject figure in the rumpled suit and curled collar arriving before seven , another marital victim of the sisterhood 's rage . " Do n't say another word , " he had admonished the innocent colleague as he lunged for his own office and plopped helplessly into the swivel chair behind his desk . In a silver frame , Barbara stared back at him , offering a Mona Lisa smile . He flung the picture into the wastebasket . He could not remember how long he sat there , blank and empty , wanting to cry . His secretary , Miss Harlow , a jolly , middle-aged lady , came in and almost immediately saw Barbara 's picture in the wastebasket . " I need lots of kindness this morning , " he said . " So I see . " " And a doughnut with my coffee from now on . " " Jelly or plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted , looking up to face her misty eyes . " And do n't try to cheer me up . " Soon after she left , Harry Thurmont called . Jonathan had secretly hoped the call would be from Barbara ,  | contrite and apologetic . He knew Harry , a divorce lawyer , only casually . People called him the Bomber . His heart sank . " She 's retained me , Rose , " Thurmont said . His voice had a gleeful note . " I guess you 're as good as any , " Jonathan said gloomily . He was annoyed that she had wasted no time in getting herself legal counsel . He realized he would have to do the same . " I think if you 're reasonable we can work things out , " Thurmont said . " I 'm really not ready to talk about it . " " I know . And I 'm real sorry . Believe me , I tried to talk her out of it . That 's always the first step . That 's what they teach us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No give at all ? " he muttered into the mouthpiece , instantly sorry for letting his anxiety show . " None , " Thurmont replied . " I do n't care . I have n't cared for a long time , " she had said . It was still impossible to believe . " Suppose she changes her mind . " " She wo n't . " " What makes you so sure ? " he asked testily . " It 's gon na be a nut cutter , " Thurmont said abruptly . " Better cover your ass . " " As bad as that ? " " Worse . " " I do n't understand . " " You will . " " When ? " Thurmont ignored the question . " You 'd better get yourself your own man quick time , " he warned . His tone was ominous . Jonathan nodded to the empty office . He knew the cardinal rule of the legal profession . Only a fool acts as  | his own lawyer , especially in a domestic case . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he began , being wishful again . Thurmont chuckled . It was the cackle of a predator and Jonathan hung up . He looked at the phone in its cradle for a long time , wondering if Barbara had told the children . With shaking fingers ? he had to rub them to get them to do the job  --  he dialed his home number . Ann answered . " She 's gone to the French Market with a new batch of pate . " " Well . . . " He started to say something . You 're not part of it , he wanted to assure her . " Is there anything you 'd like me to tell her , Jona-than ? " " Lots , " he answered . " Mostly bad . " " I 'm sorry . " It would n't be long , he was certain , before his wife turned her against him . The children as well . But why ? If only he had some real clue to his crime . Perhaps , then , the punishment would be acceptable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of a good divorce lawyer . The man , Jim Richards , answered instantly . " Harry Thurmont . " " That 's hers . " " You poor bastard . " He shook his head and looked at Jonathan sadly . " Run for the hills . He 'll take your eyeballs . " " I doubt that , " Jonathan said . " I expect we 'll be quite civilized about it . " " Civilized ? Harry Thurmont is n't civilized . You 're in the jungle now . " He thumbed through his phone book . " Try Murray Goldstein . He 's in the building . He 's an ex-rabbi . You 'll get lectures and lots of sympathy . You 'll need it . " " All she wants is out , " Jonathan muttered .  | " That 's what they all say . " He made an appointment for the same day  --  professional courtesy . But before he left the office he tried Barbara again , just to make sure he had n't dreamed all this . She answered the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At what ? he wondered . Hell , he thought , you do n't just throw your life away . He was willing to forgive . " I 'm not mad , Jonathan . " " And you 're still " ? she was making him say it ? " thinking about divorce . " " Did n't Thurmont call you ? " " Yes , he did . " " It 's not a question of mad . We have a lot of practical details to iron out . The District has a no-fault provision . " The legalese angered him . So she was already getting educated . " God damn it , Barbara , " he began , feeling his chest heave . The memory of his hospital stay invaded his mind . " You just ca n't do this . " " Jonathan , we went over that last night . " She sighed . " Have you told the kids ? " " Yes . They had a right to know . " " You could have at least waited for me . I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was best they hear it directly from me , with all my reasons . " " What about my reasons ? " " I 'm sure you 'll offer your own explanations . " She paused . " We 're not going to have needless custody problems , Jonathan ? " Her calm reasonableness irritated him . He felt burning begin again in his chest , a spear of pain . He spilled two Maalox tablets into his palm and chewed them quickly .  | " I guess not , " he said , confused . " Why disrupt their lives ? I told them that we were going to live apart , but that you 'd still be easily accessible . I assumed that . You are their father . I hope I did n't overreach . " " I do n't want them to suffer , " Jonathan said lamely , feeling the palpitation subside . He swallowed repeatedly to get rid of the chalky taste in his mouth . She 's torpedoing my life and making me a party to it , he told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's it , then ? " he asked . His ear had been groping for a single shred of contrition . He had n't found a minute sign of it . Her response to his question was silence . " If only I had been prepared . Seen a sign . Something . I feel like I 've been shot between the eyes . " " Do n't get melodramatic , Jonathan . It 's been disintegrating for years . " " Then why did n't I ever see it ? " " Part of you probably did . " " Now you 're a psychiatrist ? " He had no urge to check his sarcasm . If she were in the room at that moment , he was certain he would have hit her . He wanted to smash her face , obliterate those innocent Slavic features , gouge out those hazel eyes , surely mocking him now . " Bitch , " he mumbled . " I expect you 'll be coming by for your things , " she said calmly . " I suppose .... " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its cradle . " Fini , " he whispered to the empty office , putting on his rumpled jacket and going out to keep his appointment with Goldstein.  | Goldstein had a benign , Semitic face . He talked like a rabbi , an idea embellished by diplomas in Hebrew lettering hanging next to his law degree . He had a fringe of curly black hair , ringing a broad , shiny bald pate , and thick horn-rimmed glasses behind which droopy-lidded eyes offered lugubrious comments on the human condition . He wore a white-on-white shirt , Yemeni cuff links , and a striped Hermes tie . He lit up a large cigar as Jonathan settled into a soft chair at the side of the desk . Goldstein was rotund , with puddles of chins , and his fingers were short and squat as they tugged daintily at the cigar . Staring out from the top of a low bookcase was a framed picture of what was undoubtedly the Goldstein menage in younger days , three rotund children and an obese wife . " I hate divorce , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family portrait . " Broken families . A shanda . I 'm sorry . It means a shame ' in Yiddish . " " I 'm not too pleased with it myself . " " Whose idea ? " Goldstein asked . " Hers . " Goldstein shook his head and blew smoke clouds into the air . He looked contemplative , sympathetic , wise . Jonathan pictured him in a beard and skullcap , dispensing solace . A priest would have inhibited him with vague , unspoken guilt feelings . What he needed most was confession . Confess what ? He felt his mind ' II begin to empty in a long stream-of-consciousness narrative heavily larded with justifications , recriminations , and revelations , all of which seemed designed to give Goldstein a distorted , self-serving , self-pitying portrait of his eighteen-year marriage . Goldstein listened patiently , puffing and nodding , his cigar dead center between his lips , his fat fingers cast in a delicate cathedral .  | When he was finished , Jonathan popped a Maalox into his mouth . The ex-rabbi destroyed his cathedral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood up , reached for a yellow legal pad , and began to shoot questions at Jonathan . " Is there another man ? " " I do n't think so . " " Whoever thinks so ? And no other woman ? " " None . " " And joint property ? " " The house , of course , and all the antiques and other possessions in it . That 's where we put everything we had . I 'd say the house might fetch at least a half million , with probably another half  --  or more  --  in antiques . God , did we lavish love on that place . " His eyes misted . Goldstein nodded , as if he were a psychoanalyst listening to a patient unreel his life . " What are you prepared to settle for , Mr. Rose ? " Goldstein asked , the gentleness gone . " I 'm not really sure . I have n't had time to think about it . I really do n't know . I do n't think the kids will be a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be comfortable . I 'm prepared to offer reasonable support . " " And the house ? " Goldstein asked . " I do n't know . Say half the value . After all , we did it together . Half of everything is okay with me . " " You want a good divorce settlement or do you want to be sentimental ? If you want to be sentimental , then you should n't get a divorce . In fact , I would rather you did n't . I hate these situations where children go from pillar to post like punching bags . Children are supposed to be a brucha . " He looked at Jonathan and shook his head . " A blessing . " " Look , Goldstein . It 's not my idea . " He felt the blood rise in his face . " I understand . " Goldstein flapped a pudgy hand .  | " You must be calm . Do n't excite yourself . " Jonathan felt him taking charge . " I know what that means , " Jonathan huffed . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headaches . A nice fat fee . " " From your mouth to God 's ears . " " I hope she feels the same way . " " Never be sure , " Goldstein said . " It is the first rule of domestic law . Never be sure . Divorce makes people crazy . " " Well , it wo n't make me crazy , " Jonathan muttered . " If it 's meant to be , then let 's get it over . You just proceed along the fastest track . " " There 's a waiting period for a no-fault divorce in the District of Columbia . Six months if the parties do n't contest . That 's the quick way . If there 's problems , there 's a year wait . A divorce you get either way . But the property settlement is separate . It could go on and on . If it goes to court , there 's more waiting . A judge decides . " Goldstein bent over , blowing smoke . " All judges are putzes . " Jonathan nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to that . " " You hope . " " We 're reasonable people . " " That was yesterday . " " I know lawyers . They can fuck things up . They call Thurmont the Bomber . " " Personally , I have mixed feelings . A court battle can help make me an even richer man . I have a loving , devoted family , Mr. Rose . " He looked longingly at the picture of his rotund children and obese wife . " They are all going to college now . I have a very large house in Potomac and a maid that lives in , two Mercedes , and I go to Israel twice a year . Harry Thurmont has all  | these things and , in addition , an airplane and a house in Saint Thomas and he 's always very tan , which means he gets away often . " " I do n't need the lecture , Goldstein . I 'm also a lawyer . " " The worst kind . You need the lecture more than a plumber . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the bare bones . " Goldstein 's cigar had gone out , and Jonathan caught a whiff of his bad breath . " All right , you 've scared the shit out of me , Goldstein . I already told you I want to settle this amicably . No hassle . I detest the idea of anyone getting rich from my misfortune . " Goldstein relit his cigar , puffed deeply , and exhaled smoke clouds into the atmosphere . " I 'll talk to Thurmont and get back to you , " Goldstein said , getting up . " From here on in , we talk to your wife only through Thurmont . " " And I pay for both ? " " I do n't make the rules . " " Just the money . " " I do n't make the divorces , either . " " But it was n't my fault , " Jonathan protested . " It was mine ? " Jonathan , sorry now he had engaged Goldstein , was more confused than ever . " Have you moved out yet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . I ca n't seem to manage it . " " Why not ? " " I 'm not sure , " Jonathan replied , wondering about his candor . " It 's my nest . I ca n't seem to fly away . It 's my place , Goldstein . My orchids . My wines . My workshop . My Staffordshire figures are there . "  | " Your what ? " " Little porcelainlike figures , beautifully painted . There 's a cobalt blue ? " " I do n't understand this , Rose , " Goldstein interrupted . " I do n't , either . None of it . " Never in his life had he been racked with such indecision . He searched Goldstein 's eyes for direction . Through droopy lids , they stared back lugubriously . Their look depressed him . " I need time , " Jonathan said after a long pause . " Time we got . " " Have we ? " Jonathan asked . It seemed his first rational thought of the day . " I just threw out nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When you speak to Thurmont , call me , " he muttered as he left the office , not certain of his destination .  | ' ca n't believe it , " Eve said . She had intruded on Ann , who was working on a bibliography for her thesis , " Jefferson as Secretary of State , " just at that point when the number of books to read and sources to check seemed overwhelming . Ann was in no mood to be provoked by the perpetual crises of a teenage girl and had learned not to be panicked by Eve 's propensity for dramatic overstatement . But she looked up and saw in Eve 's misty-eyed face an agitation that engaged her attention . Eve bent over her seated form and embraced her , putting her cheek against her own . Patting her head , Ann waited for Eve to unburden herself . " They 've split , " she said , unable to hold back a chest-racking brace of sobs . " Hey , what 's this ? " Ann said , turning and embracing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mom and Dad . They 've decided to go their separate ways , " Eve said when she was able to speak . Ann , of course , knew what had happened . But the idea had n't quite sunk in . It was the unthinkable incar-  | nate . She continued to deny it to herself . No one is prepared for a suddenly realized fantasy . She began to feel the full impact of her guilt . " I 'm sure it 's temporary , " Ann said quietly . Some secret , transient tension , she decided , not being privy to what really went on between them . " Married people are always having spats . " She had never seen them raise their voices to each other . " Not a spat , Ann , " Eve said , finding her self-control . She seemed to be teetering on the edge of maturity . Such events , Ann knew , could be a catalyst , forcing adulthood . Eve sat on the edge of the sleigh bed and lit a cigarette , picking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a declaration of independence , Ann , " Eve said , clouds of smoke pouring out with her words . " I did n't know who she was , although I knew what she meant . She said it would n't affect my relationship with Dad , that it was all going to be very civilized and understanding . She was sure of that . " Eve shook her head and sighed as Ann waited for her to continue . But what was the real reason ? she wanted to ask . Eve seemed to read her mind . " She said it was her idea . She said that I was a woman and would be sure to understand . What she wanted was to be free to fulfill her own aspirations and did n't want to be an appendage anymore . She said Dad was strong and time would heal his hurt . " She looked up fiercely at Ann . " I did n't know what she meant , so " I asked her and she explained . " She paused and her face seemed bemused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the worst part was the thought that she was n't happy with Dad . " " Maybe he was n't happy as well , " Ann blurted out , instantly sorry . In her heart she was fishing for another explanation .  | " She did n't say . " " I 'm sure there are reasons on both sides . " " After she told me , I felt like I was in a car accident . I 'm still in shock . I mean everybody , all my friends , even me , believed they had the best relationship of any married couple anywhere . The way they did things together . Doing all the things with this house . " Her voice rose and she mashed out her cigarette in a dish of paper clips . " She asked me to understand , to try to understand . I said I 'd try . But I lied . I do n't understand this at all . What does she want to be free from ? " Ann blew out a long gasp of air . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explanation . " Maybe it 's too complex for us to understand . " " She has everything . Absolutely everything . And she 's just started out on a great new business . Certainly we 're no bother . " " Did she tell Josh ? " " He got it first . But you know Josh . When something hurts , he goes off into the corner like a whipped dog . Just like Benny when Dad yells at him . I saw him leaning against the tree in front of the house , just bouncing his basketball . I knew something was wrong . But this ? " " Have you discussed this with your father ? " " He was long gone . He slept in the guest room last night . No . I have n't discussed it with him . I 'm afraid to . Considering what he 's just been through . Thinking he was dying and all and none of us coming up to be near him . " It had confused Ann as well . She had watched Barbara 's initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with uncommon speed , it subsided . She had n't , after all , heard the other end of the conversation and the way Barbara had gone about filling the casserole dishes with the cassoulet for the Paks one would have thought  | that Jonathan had only a mild indisposition . " He 'll be fine , " Barbara had said , and she was right . " It ca n't be a heart attack . He 's too young . And the Roses have the genes of longevity . " " I ca n't blame him if he was upset , " Eve said . " But I did n't expect her to be the one who . . . " She was obviously still confused by her mother 's announcement . " Maybe it will all come out in the wash , " Ann said , disturbed by her own conflicting emotions . She was wondering , as well , how it would affect her own status in the house . Would they keep her on ? Surely now Barbara would need her more than ever . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , and she could not resist a vague , utterly illogical sense of betrayal . He will be leaving me , she thought , shocked at the depth of her feeling . Ili ? " She 's already gone to see a lawyer . I 'm afraid this is the end of the happy Rose family , " Eve said with adolescent sarcasm . " He has n't moved out yet ? " Ann asked , wondering if she had missed something . " Not yet . " " He 's a very resourceful man . He 'll be fine . " " Will he ? " The tears rolled over the lower lids of Eve 's eyes , wetting her cheek . Her nose reddened . " Poor Daddy . " She reached out and Ann was there to embrace her . But who would soothe her ? Ann wondered . Sitting at her desk , she had been listening for his familiar step . Although she was growing drowsy and had difficulty keeping her eyes open , the sound of his key in the downstairs lock quickly restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny 's bark and the click of his nails against the marble as they came into the house . Barbara would not let Benny in except  | when Jonathan came home . Did her disgust extend to the animal as well ? Ann wondered . She waited to hear the sound of Jonathan 's ascending step . None came . Then she moved through the doorway of her room to the head of the landing , peering into the darkness of the second floor , listening to the sounds of the sleeping house . She wondered if the others were listening as well , secretly observing with their senses what was , to all of them , a considerable household trauma . She waited until she was certain that no one had stirred and , after a longer wait , walked soundlessly down to the second floor , listening first at Eve 's door , then at Josh 's , although she dared not move to the front of the house and Barbara 's door . An alibi had already been concocted in her mind . She wanted a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied late . Those previous occasions would make her story plausible . All she did was pop a tea bag into a cup and drown it with hot water from the Instant Hot tap . In the kitchen , she deliberately placed the cup on the saucer with enough force to produce an audible tinkle . If anyone was listening , she wanted to dispel the impression that she was sneaking around . She had to see him , she decided . How could this have happened to such a man ? How could Barbara possibly reject Jona-than ? She took another teacup off the shelf and dropped in a tea bag , filled the cup with hot water , and put both cups on a tray . Something was missing , she decided , looking around until she spotted a ceramic cookie ja ; in which Barbara placed her chocolate-chip cookies . She laid out some cookies on the tray and carried it to the library . He was sprawled on the leather couch , looking haggard and unshaven , his hand shielding his eyes from the glare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , startled , revealing his disappointed reaction . Perihaps he was expecting Barbara . " I was making myself a cup of tea and I thought you might . . . " Her hands shook , rattling the teacups on the tray . In the air was the sour odor of alcohol , and it struck her suddenly that he might be drunk . Beneath her quilted robe and pajamas , she felt her nakedness and a sudden stabbing sensation in her nipples . A nerve palpitated in her neck . " No need , really , Ann , " he said , his voice gravelly . But he had lifted himself on one elbow and was squinting at her , not quite sober but not quite drunk . She started to turn , but his voice stopped her . " Might as well , " he said , sitting up , running his fingers through his hair . She moved the tray toward him and he took the teacup , but left the cookies . " Good , " he said . " Nice and hot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gives me a second wind . " He was , she imagined , forcing his politeness . He had never really noticed her . Certainly not as a woman . She put the tray down on the couch beside him and , still standing , began to sip her own tea . " I suppose you know what 's happened ? " he said . She nodded , but he did not look up , preferring instead to stare at the teacup . " I started to come home for dinner . Then I thought , Jesus Christ , I ca n't come home for dinner . So I went to the Hilton and sat at the bar . Then I had dinner at the coffee shop . Did you ever realize how impersonal hotel living can be ? " He looked up at her , then his eyes wandered . She was thankful he was not waiting for an answer . " It 's beyond my comprehension , Ann . " He shook his head and looked around the library . " A man builds a fortress against the terrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we worked like beavers on those shel looked at his hands . " I built a lot of things with these . I know some of the most intimate secrets of these obves . " He paused . " That rent table . We found the son of a bitch in a little antique barn outside Frederick . Something deliciously sinister about it . The tenant put the rent in one of those little cubbies and the landlord just revolved the top , scooped up the money , and put it in a drawer . Nice and neat . A kind of symbolic fortress . Did you know that , Ann ? " " Josh explained it once . " " Josh . Oh , shit . " " They 're fine , Jonathan . I had a long talk with Eve . " He put his teacup back on the tray and surprised her suddenly by stretching out his hand to her . Since she was holding the teacup , she could not respond . She felt her knees shake . " Dear Ann , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The palpitation in her body grew more forceful and her ears pounded . Putting down the teacup , she grasped his hand , continuing to stand but keeping her distance . God , how she longed to embrace him . His hand felt hot in hers . " I do n't know how the hell I 'm going to explain it to them . " He drew a deep breath between his teeth . " I feel so damned inadequate . " " Inadequate ? You ? " He withdrew his hand and she let it drop . Let me love you , her mind screamed , frightening her . She watched his head droop into his hands . " I 've never been through this before . I do n't know what to do . I can barely face anybody . Barely function . I have n't even got the will to move out . I 'm , quite literally , paralyzed . Zombied into a state of shock . I was standing out there in front of the Hilton and I suddenly  | felt disoriented , alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I even lost track of time . I do n't know how I got home . " He lifted his head as if he wanted her to glimpse his anguish . Confide in me , she begged silently . " I feel so helpless . I ca n't believe it 's happening . " " Perhaps it will pass , " she said . She seemed to hold her breath . " Never . It 's over , Ann . " She forced herself to hide her elation . " I just want you to know . . . " She felt her face flush . " That I 'm going to stick by the kids . I think they 'll be fine . Just fine . " She wondered about that . Eve was already smoking heavily . Josh had become withdrawn . Only Barbara seemed blithely content . " And if you need me for anything . " She felt suddenly manipulative , sinister , hardly as innocent as she thought herself to be . A fantasy suddenly filled her mind . He was coming toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs . She felt her lips begin to swell . " Anything , " she said . He closed his eyes and nodded . He reached out to her , and she took his hand again . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Dear Ann , " he whispered , more brotherly than she had wished . He released her hand , then lay back on the couch and closed his eyes . She watched him for a long time before departing .  | Harry Thurmont was dapper in his pin-striped suit and high , oversized collar as he watched her from behind his free-form Plexiglas desk . Behind him , framed in a wide picture window , was the White House and , beyond , the Washington Monument . The senior partner in Jonathan 's firm had a similar view , Barbara thought suddenly , remembering that Jonathan had once told her that such a view automatically doubled the fee . " He has n't moved out . I do n't understand it , " Barbara said . She sat in a deep easy chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bulbous nose and watery gray eyes . " A drinker " was her first thought until he announced that he was AA , insisting on the reformed drunk 's obligatory precis of his life . " My elbow is permanently bent , " he told her . " But since I 'm off the sauce , I 'm mean as hell . " " I hope that side of you wo n't be necessary , " she had told him at their first meeting two days ago . She was n't so sure now . " He 's like some kind of animal . Almost invisible . He leaves early , before we get up , and comes home late ,  | long after we 've gone to bed . He does n't take his meals at home . I know Eve called him at the office and they spoke for a long time . And he 's been in touch with Josh . I think he met him yesterday after school . He 's really a good man . Believe me , if there was another way ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thurmont said . " I 'm in touch with Goldstein and we 'll take it from there . The wisest thing is to let him phase out in his own time . " " Suppose he does n't ? " " Well , then , are you prepared to move out ? " It had begun to confuse her . Not that she had thought through any of it . She was simply obeying her instincts , knowing that it was absolutely necessary to do what she had done . She felt , quite literally , free . " Of course I 'm not going to move out of my own house , " she said flatly . " It 's also his , " Thurmont said quietly , fastening his eyes on her face , inspecting her . " It 's unthinkable , " she said . " You know that . I know that . He knows that .

" He turned toward her , watching her , a canny smile on his face . The half glasses made him look shrewd . " In an uncontested situation , we 'll just hammer out a plan . Goldstein 's a pain in the ass . A talmudic Jew , always pinning arguments on great moral  | tenets . He runs up the rate . So far , your husband has been a pushover . " " He 's very family oriented , " she said . He put down the paper and removed his glasses . " You 're not home safe by any means . " He reached over to a carved wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrapper before he lit it . " The major question in these events is how we divide the spoils . Possessions . It 's the curse of the age .

Like making a treaty in some ninth-century war between kingdoms . Your husband 's accountant is doing an inventory and as soon as that 's done we can cut into the carcass . " She had n't been prepared for any of it . There 's no school for divorce , her divorced friends had asserted . They had n't gone into the substance of her material settlement , only the abstractions of what it meant to be on one 's own , the joy and the pain . And , of course , the different men . Barbara had been mesmerized by that part of it . " Most of them are like children , " one of her friends , Peggy Laughton , had pointed out . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized it , " an occasional Saturday-night fucker .

She was eager to taste this aspect of her freedom . " He 's already offered you half the value of the house . But that 's only the opening gambit . A bit of bullshit . It 's you who probably have the handle on that one . Unless , as I said before , you intend to move out . The upkeep is going to be fairly steep . "  | " My business is starting to roll , " she said . " With his payments and my extra income , that should do it . " He shook his head and smiled . " You did n't understand the implication .

What she detested most was Thurmont 's posturing and superiority , as if he were the possessor of some special knowledge . " He offered you half the value of the house and its possessions . Not the house . Not what you have inside it . The value . Which means that an independent appraiser will look things over and determine what the real market value is . Then Jonathan will probably go out and borrow the money and make one big settlement . As near as I can figure without the inventory , you might walk away with , say , between four or five hundred thou after fees . It 's a heavy wad . Should get you through the long , hard winter . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ashtray . She saw his shadow loom close and caught the whiff of his musky cologne . For a moment she felt herself bracing for a physical onslaught . For some reason , she was certain , he had decided to make a pass . He did n't , merely standing over her , looking down , underlining her helplessness . " I do n't think that 's fair , " she said . " Fair ? " He stopped abruptly and she wondered if  | she had headed him off . She was annoyed that he had not made a pass . Maybe being fair game is what she really wanted , a real declaration of independence . With the exception of Josh and Jonathan , she had no idea of what other men really looked like , felt like . That , too , was n't fair . " Are you going to lecture me about fair ' ? " he said . " I ca n't lecture you about something that does n't exist . " She enjoyed her jab at him . He offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was not intimidated . " You think it 's fair for me to have devoted nearly twenty years to his career , his needs , his wants , his desires , his security . I gave up my schooling for him . I had his children . And I devoted a hell of a lot more time to that house than he did . Besides , the house is all I have to show for it . I ca n't match his earning power . Hell , in a few years he 'll be able to replace its value . I 'll just have cash . Well , that 's not good enough . I want the house . I want all of it . It 's not only a house . It 's a symbol of a life-style . And I intend to keep it that way . That 's fair . " During the outburst his eyes had never wavered from her face and when she was through he offered her an unmistakably approving smile . " Well , " he said , " we have here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her ear , " Do you mean it ? Or is it merely indignation talking ? In the real world indignation collapses first . " " It 's real as shit , " she hissed , surprised at the extent of her firmness , wondering if it was really the way she felt inside . Was it possible that her resentment had been so deep ? In the night , especially that first night , the guilt had come charging up at her , blocking out every- ; ! - thing but her own imagined perfidy . She had called her mother in Boston and that had n't helped one bit .  | " I do n't understand what you 're saying , " her mother had exclaimed after what Barbara knew was a long , garbled explanation . Hell , I do n't need her approval , she had told herself . Of course they would think her mad . Everyone , including her children , might think her mad . In the cavern of her empty bed , she was n't quite sure . All the resentment seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled into her mind was what one might call the good things . Jonathan had been so supportive of her desire to get out and do something . Anything . He had been the principal motivator behind the kitchen , urging her on to the pursuit of the commercial possibilities of what she once believed was merely her pedestrian housewife talent . So he must think that he has created a monster . He was always someone to lean on , to be protected by , steady and sure and knowing and handy and decent and loving . A good provider . A good father . A good son . So , then , why was she doing this to him ? She had barely been able to get her doubts through the night . The next night she took a Valium and things were better . Last night it had been still better . She was beginning to agree with herself again . " Up to now , Barbara , " Thurmont said , intruding on her thoughts , " I would have thought you 'd be the usual twenty-four-karat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfulfilled woman . The beaches are strewn with their bloated corpses . They left home with empty purses , hot crotches , and high hopes . Fools . The lot of them . They did n't have to leave home empty-handed . They did n't even have to leave home . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " It 's possible , Barbara . We might be able to pull it off . But that will depend on you . He 'll buck , of course . It 'll be one hell of a mess . Dog eat dog . " " I wo n't move . I want it all . "  | " It will mean time . My time . Your time . Pain . Arguments . Anguish . Inconvenience . Is it worth the can-dle ? " " Damned straight . " Thurmont looked at her with satisfaction . " You 've got pluck , lady , " he said happily , relighting his cigar . In his words she read : I love messy divorces . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " she said .  | That morning he had started to pack , filling a suitcase in fits and starts . He went down to the library and fondly touched his Staffordshire figures , lifting a Little Red Riding Hood , a Garibaldi , a Napoleon , caressing them fondly as he replaced them on the mantel . Then his fingers lovingly slid over the intricate carving of the armoire . He remembered how happy he had been when it was delivered to the house . In the foyer he opened the case of the face of the long clock , and as he had done every morning for more than five years , he cranked the winding key and , checking the time against his Piaget , moved the minute hand forward by two minutes . He loved the familiar click of the pendulum on its relentless journey through time and patted the smooth mahogany of the case . Then he looked at the familiar figures of Cribb and Molineaux and , quickly , his eyes misted . Not today , he decided . It hurts too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked swiftly to his office . Miss Harlow had his coffee and doughnut waiting . The first bite stuck in his throat . How can I leave my own house ? he asked himself ,  | feeling for the first time that justice , morality , decency , and fairness were on his side . An hour later , Goldstein told him the news . Jonathan looked at Goldstein in disbelief , but he saw no relief in the man 's sad eyes , the hooded lids droopy with the weight of the world 's sins . " You 're lying to me , " Jonathan cried , his voice rising , the words reverberating in his mind as if it were a wind tunnel . " You ca n't blame the bad news on the messenger . " " The dirty bitch . " Jonathan slapped Goldstein 's desk , scattering papers with the rush of air his palm created . " It 's Thurmont . That bastard . " " It 's natural . In a divorce action it 's obligatory to hate the lawyers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do me a favor , Rose . Leave God out of it . " Jonathan slapped the desk again , overwhelmed by rage , the injustice of it . Was it possible he had invested almost half his life in this marriage ? For this ? For noth-ing ? " How fair can a man be ? " Jonathan said after he had got his rage under control . " I 've given her no trouble . No custody battles . I 've agreed to a generous maintenance . Surely she can leave me with something . " " Why ? " ? " Because I earned it . It 's mine . " " She says she earned it , too . " " Half . I 'm willing to give half . " Again the anger ripped at his innards and he popped two Maaloxes in his mouth . " I wo n't have it . I mean it 's not fair . The house is ours . OURS . She takes the OU . I take the RS . I was going to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She does n't want the value . She wants the house , "  | Goldstein said . " I probed all the possibilities . I offered half the house and told her she could continue to live in it with the kids . " " I did n't authorize that , " Jonathan said , looking at Goldstein with daggers of hatred . " You had no right to offer that kind of deal . You never consulted me about that , Goldstein . " " I was probing . I wanted to find out how far they were willing to go . I wanted to at least show them we were reasonable . Who thought they would go this far ? " " Not me . That 's for sure . " " It wo n't be nice , " Goldstein said . " Nothing is nice . Not anymore . " " Never mind nice . The subject is wealth . Yours . She wants to strip you of everything . What have you got besides the house ? " " My Ferrari , " he said stupidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't include that . Not the wine , either . Or your tools . " " How generous . " " What else ? " Goldstein snapped . Jonathan 's mind clouded . " What about insurance ? " " I forgot about that . She 's the principal beneficiary . " " Change it quick . " The idea curdled his guts . If he died now , she would receive a million . And get the house to boot . The recollection agitated him , but cleared his head . " There 's the phone . " Goldstein pointed . " If you walked outside this building and got hit by a truck , you would be very unhappy ... seeing that she would get all that money . " It took Jonathan a few moments to reach his insurance man , who happened to be in his office . He wanted to know details .  | " Not now . Just change it to Eve and Josh . All right ? Cut out Barbara . " Jonathan hung up the phone without a word . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call had made him feel better , although he still had to sign a form the agent was putting in the mail . " I 'll make arrangements to speed up the inventory , " Goldstein said . " I want everything in that house on a piece of paper fast . Before she gets any bright ideas . " " She had better not take a damned thing . That would be stealing . I 'll give up nothing . Not the house or anything in it . Never . " His throat tightened and his voice cackled . " Never say never . ' " " Fuck you , Goldstein . " Jonathan stood up , started to leave , then sat down again . " I built my whole life around that house , " Jonathan mumbled , his head in his hands , feeling a whirlpool of sentiment well up inside him . " I have my workshop there . All my antiques . My collections . My paintings . It 's a total thing . It ca n't be broken apart . " He felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique auctions . " I have my wine . My Lafite-Rothschild ' 59 's , my Chateau Margaux ' 64 's , my Grand Vin de Chateau Latour ' 66 's . My orchids . You do n't understand . You have n't seen the place . It 's a jewel . I lavished love on it . In ten years it 'll double in value , maybe triple . And so will everything in it . " He taught his breath and sighed . " You do n't understand , Goldstein . I know every wire in that house , every fiber of wood and brick and slate . I know its pipes . Its innards . It is as much a part of me as my right hand . " " Spare me please , Rose . "  | " You have no sensitivity to that , Goldstein . It 's not merely a possession . " He shrugged . " People like you do n't understand . " " Do n't get anti-Semitic . It wo n't solve anything . " " Well , then , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end always the law . " Goldstein stood up to his full , squat , half-pint size and , marching over to a wall of books , patted them fondly . " The law is an ass , ' " Jonathan said , remembering Dickens 's famous character . " Not as big an ass as you think . There are still some arrows in our quiver . " Jonathan grabbed the shred of hope like a drowning man grasps a piece of floating flotsam . " Title 16-904 , Section C , " Goldstein said smugly , watching his face . " It allows a no-fault divorce even if a man and woman live under one roof . Separately , of course . No cohabitation . The waiting period is not affected . " " So I do n't have to leave ? " " No . But . . . " Goldstein held up his hand . " Who gets the house and its contents is still up to the court . The judge could decide it 's too contentious and order everything to be sold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on for years , considering the crowded dockets . " Jonathan felt a surge of hope . " And my willingness to stay there . Fight for it . That will show my fervor . Maybe ... my very presence will force her out . " " Do n't get overly ambitious . There 's still the kids to think about . " " Maybe she 'll see the light . Hell , she 's getting the kids . She can easily buy another place with the money I 'm prepared to give her . " He stood up and clapped his  | hands , then reality intruded again . " How in hell can I live in the same house with her ? It 'll be a nightmare . Who the hell thought up such a stupid idea ? " " The schvartzes , " Goldstein said , getting up and starting to pace about the office . " Many of them could n't afford to maintain two domiciles , so they made it easy on themselves and had a law passed . " " Maybe that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jonathan said gloomily , his elation disintegrating . " God damn it , Goldstein , " he thundered suddenly . " I ca n't do it . I ca n't possibly do it . While she 's there I ca n't possibly live in that house . The way I feel now I 'll want to strangle her every time I see her . " " That , " Goldstein said , pointing a chubby forefinger , like a threatening gun barrel , at his head , " is what loses cases . " He paused and moved back to his desk . " Number one . " He lifted a fat pinky . " Do you want to lose the house entirely ? " " Absolutely not . " " Then I strongly suggest 16-904 , Section C , " Goldstein said emphatically . A sudden thought seemed to intrude . " You could also make sure she does n't sell anything . . . those collections . " " My Staffordshires . " " Or your wines . Then comes number two . " Goldstein lifted the finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had had much practice in exercising that particular joint . " You have to be willing to sacrifice . You must n't give her a single cause for legal action . She will undoubtedly try to dislodge you . " " Like how ? " " By making you miserable . " " I can do the same . " Goldstein held up a hand , like a traffic cop .  | " Do n't interfere with the household . Be like a little mouse . No girlfriends in the house . Nothing she can hang a case on . " " No sex ? " " Not in the house . Better nothing . It 's not long . A year . " " I thought you said six months . " " If one of the parties contests , it 's a year . We 're going to contest . The divorce will still get granted under no-fault . But why make it easy ? Maybe the tension will break down her demands . This is a war , Rose . It 's not Monopoly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A judge is a putt . " Goldstein smiled . " Also unpredictable . Who knows ? " " I have no choice , then . " " Of course you do . You can move out . " " That 's no choice , " Jonathan said firmly . " All you have to do is live there . As innocuously as possible . Do n't take your meals there . Leave her the kitchen . Let her run the house as always . Be just a squatter . The best tack is to be inconspicuous . As I said . Like a mouse . " " And the kids ? " " It does n't look like the kids will be a problem . Be fatherly , but under no circumstances let them be made an issue . In terms of Mrs. Rose , try to be cool , polite , proper , and distant . If you think she 's up to something fishy , tell me . Do n't give her any cause for action . Do n't do anything stupid . Do n't take anything out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . " " I 've got to be a prisoner in my own house , " he mumbled . Goldstein ignored him . " Number three . " The middle digit joined the others . " Be patient . Exercise . Go to the movies a lot . Play  | with yourself . Anything to keep your mind off your problems . " " Fat chance , " he said . " And number four ? " " Number four , " Goldstein said , shaking his head sadly and looking deep into Jonathan 's face , " is not to be a schmuck and do something that you 'll be sorry for . And number five " ? Goldstein smiled , showing a line of spaced teeth like a picket fence ? " is to pay my monthly retainer on time . " Jonathan sat in his office long after the others had gone . He had shooed away the cleaning woman , a portly Spanish-looking lady who looked at him knowingly . He was certain she had guessed that he was sitting there because he had no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , he seemed transparent . The eyes looked back out of hollowed pockets . The declivity of his cheeks had increased . The disregard for his usual fastidiousness showed everywhere . His tie was awry , the collar of his shirt rumpled . His beard seemed to have grown more rapidly than usual , and his mouth felt oddly smoky . He was sure he had caught Goldstein 's halitosis and he blew into his palm to confirm it . He could not stand the sight or smell of himself any longer . Leaving his office , he went into the street . He could n't bear the thought of eating alone in a restaurant , waiting for service , choosing from the menu , feeling the butt of wandering eyes and their pity for his aloneness , speculating on his miserable existence , on his life of quiet desperation and terror . He continued to walk , unable to stop the jumble in his mind , bemoaning the tragedy of his life , once so promising . He had given up the possibility that he was dreaming . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-  | ways , upon awakening , he would reach out to her and cuddle his body full length against hers , proving her presence . " I 'll die if I ever lose you , " he would whisper , wondering if she had heard . " I could n't bear it . " It was a nightmare no longer confined to the darkness . Without consciously making a decision , he walked into the Circle Theater , remembering Goldstein 's suggestion . They were playing a double feature  --  The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps  --  two early Hitchcocks . He bought the largest bucket of popcorn , drenched it in butter , and walked into the darkened theater . Both movies had been made before he was born , he noted , surely a less complicated time . Had people really been that simple and direct ? The stories gripped him at times , took him away from his problems , but when his consciousness snapped back and revealed his isolation , he would feel a momentary wave of claustrophobia . What was he doing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With sustained anger and not an iota of fear , he walked along the dark and crime-ridden streets , almost hoping that he might be attacked so that he could vent all his frustration on the antagonist . He tried to will himself to be a lure , slowing down when he heard footsteps approaching , disappointed finally when he discovered that he was in front of his house . As always , Benny was waiting , snuggling against his leg . Through the front windows he could see the dull glow of the kitchen light and when he opened the front door the aroma of her cooking reached his nostrils . The meaty flavor of her pate had once been overwhelmingly tempting . Now it filled him with nausea . Before he could reach the foot of the stairs , Barbara materialized ,  | still dressed and aproned , her face flushed from activity . He turned his eyes away and felt his hands reach out for the coolness of the brass banister . The chandelier was unlit . In the dim light he could make out the tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said gently . His heart lurched as his mind leaped at the possibility of a reconciliation . It was too tempting to ignore . He wondered how he should play it . That depended on the degree of her contrition , he decided . Please , let God be magnanimous , Jonathan urged . He followed her into the library . She turned on one of the Tiffany lamps and the soft glow enveloped her as she wiped her hands on her apron . Lady Macbeth . He smiled at the errant image . She sat down on the edge of one of the leather chairs , remarkably cool and businesslike . He wondered if it was an ominous sign , and was quickly rewarded for his curiosity . " You ca n't stay here , Jonathan , " she said crisply . " Not now . " Her voice was soft but firm . He was ashamed of his hopefulness . " It 's a question of facing reality , " she said , sighing . " I just feel it will be better for all parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , " he snapped , recalling Goldstein . She looked at him thoughtfully for a moment . " Yes . I suppose you 're right . But certainly it wo n't be a healthy situation . " What troubled him most was her command of herself . Her firm assertion . You 've come a long way , baby , he thought . Why are you doing this to me ? His gaze washed over the room that he had created , the rubbed-walnut shelves , the rows of leather-bound books , filled with so much now-useless wisdom . " I thought I offered you a most reasonable solu-  | tion , " he said , trying to capture his usual lawyerlike demeanor when dealing with clients . But the tremor in his voice gave him away . " Not to me " she said quietly . " Reasonable ? To take everything . Leave me with nothing . That 's reasonable ? " His voice started to rise , but he remembered Goldstein 's caution . " It 's my payment for being your security blanket for nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years what you can earn in one . No matter how great my business goes . For me , that 's reasonable . " He started to pace about the room , touching obHe stuck a finger into one of the cubbies of the rent table and spun it around . " I 've invested so much of myself in this place . Sure " ly as much as you . " He was being deliberately calm , trying to hold in his temper . He looked down at her . She seemed cold , clear-eyed . Unbending . " I ca n't believe you 're so ruthless about this , Barbara , considering all we shared for eighteen years . " " I 'm not going to yield to any guilt trip , Jonathan . I 've come to grips with that . The problem for you to understand is that I 'm thinking only of myself for the first time in my life . " " And the kids ? " " Believe me , I intend to fully discharge my responsibilities . " She frowned . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not clear , Barbara . If I understood it , maybe I could be more tolerant . " " I know , " Barbara said , with what seemed like a hint of compassion . She bit her lip , a normal gesture for her when she was troubled . " I 'm changed , that 's all . Not the old me . Any explanation sounds cruel . I do n't want to be cruel . " " The lady doth protest too much , methinks . ' " " That 's one of them . One of the things I detest so  | much in you , Jonathan . All those literary allusions that forced me to ask for explanations , as if they were a proof of your superiority . " " Pardon me for having lived . " " Now you 're getting hostile . " I need you , Goldstein , he shouted to himself , brushing his hands through the air as if that would dispel the conversation . Goldstein had warned him not to deal with her directly . But how could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you truly expect any other response ? " he said quietly . " It wo n't matter . I have to think of the long pull for myself . " She stood up and again wiped her hands on her apron . " I 'm sorry , Jonathan . I know it seems selfish . But I have to protect my future . " " You 're inhuman , " he snapped . " I ca n't help your perception . " He turned to the library entrance and paused , emptying his mind of false hopes . " I do n't intend to leave this house . I do n't intend to give it up . I do intend to fight you every foot of the way , regardless of expense in dollars or emotions . I want this house and everything in it . And I do not intend to lose . " " It 's not going to be that simple , " she said quietly . He marched up the stairs and into the guest room . As he closed the door , snapping the thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complete with key . From here on in , he told himself , reveling in his belligerence , this is company headquarters .  | The house was staked out like a battlefield . Ann tried desperately to maintain a scrupulous neutrality lest it affect her own circumstances , although she did not know how long she could hold on in the midst of the unbearable tension . Barbara and Jonathan had installed locks on their respective bedrooms . At first that seemed to Ann unnecessary until she began to observe the extent of their growing hostility . They had separate phones installed as well , leaving one of the original lines intact for the children . The kitchen was hers . He apparently had given up all rights to both the food and the facilities , although she saw a little carton of orange juice on the ledge of the side window of the guest room , conveying an utterly incongruous boardinghouse look . He never took his meals at home , and he maintained Benny from a stock of dry dog food he kept in his room . Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless service to the local bitches , and returning home by instinct so that he could spend the night sleeping at the foot of Jonathan 's bed . Jonathan also retained rights to the maintenance of  | his orchids . And he continued to spend a great deal of time in his workroom . By silent consent , it was considered his domain . It was there that he generally met with the children and , at times , with Ann , who used the most transparent pretexts to visit . The Ferrari 's special place in the garage was his domain , as well . Sometimes , when feeling very down , he would strip away the Ferrari 's cover , remove its fiberglass top , and take it out for a brief spin , or he would spend hours tuning it and polishing its body . Allowing him such pursuits required no sacrifice on Barbara 's part . Besides , she was literally working herself at double time to build her catering business . The house was constantly filled with the aroma of her cooking . Ann was fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more caution on her part . It was , she knew , downright dangerous to poke one 's head above the shell holes of no-man's-land . Even the humor of it , the sheer illogic of the process , paled as the days wore on . By force of will , she maintained an observer 's distance , while inside she seethed with a profound and exasperating curiosity . Every movement in the house became a signpost , every unguarded look a nuance , every stray word a symbol of some impending action . At night she would go over what she had observed during the day , attributing motives , calculating advances or retreats . She wondered if they observed her inspection and when she felt anxious about this , she retreated further into her pose of indifference . Even the children seemed to have given up . At first they had been slyly trying to effect a reconciliation , but that had quickly dissipated in the face of their parents ' obvious unrelenting hostility and they assumed an air of grudging acceptance and , finally , tolerance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her  | one night . The announcement seemed in the nature of an epiphany and Ann noted that Eve was spending more time with her friends , less time under her scrutiny . It was pointless , she decided , to attempt to maintain a more rigid discipline over the children at a time of such trial . Josh found solace in basketball and other sports and , since he had not lost contact with his father , he seemed to be maintaining a business-as-usual equilibrium . Sometimes she felt uncomfortable about her inspector 's role . It took effort and concentration . And , of course , she had to hide her own interest . Was it possible for Jonathan to see in her an alternative ? The question gnawed at her and filled her with guilt . " You 're awfully quiet , " Barbara remarked one day . " I had n't realized , " Ann responded . " I suppose I ca n't really blame you . The way things have altered around here . " It was her first real attempt at self-justification to Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not betray her . " Who can possibly understand but another woman who has undergone the same experiences ? You can never really transfer your outrage . The house , in my opinion , is fair compensation . He can have another one just like it in a few short years . Maybe sooner . I can never have it again unless I marry . Then the whole cycle starts again . " Although she was working harder , she seemed more beautiful than ever , glowing , in fact , a quality totally incongruous , considering her " plight . " " I 'm not competent to judge , " Ann replied , remembering the undeclared war of her own parents ' married life . She had rarely seen even the most primitive gestures of respect between them . They seemed to survive on a diet of mutual hate . " I 'm not a good one to ask  | about married life . My background is very traditional , " she lied . " I know . The husband pulls down a paycheck and the wife cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected that Barbara had gotten harder , more vocal and intransigent . Between Jonathan and Barbara communication was , in the early days of the new arrangement , nonexistent . Sometimes it was unavoidable , and Ann would hear scraps of conversation that always disintegrated into a rising crescendo of vituperation . " I 'll pay all electric and gas bills that can be attributed to normal household operations . Not to your business activities . Those you pay for . " He had confronted her in the kitchen late one evening . Ann , who was helping to baste a roasting goose while Barbara prepared a batch of baking dough , quickly faded from the scene , far enough to be out of their vision but close enough to hear . " How can you calculate the difference ? " Barbara asked sarcastically . " I 'm having a man come in from the electric and gas companies . If necessary , we 'll put in separate meters . " " What about the power from your workroom and the sauna ? " " I take no profit from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would you like to charge me for the use of my room as well ? The cost of my electric blanket ? " " If I could , I would . " " And I do n't appreciate your fudging on the food bill . Thurmont agreed that you would keep those charges separate . There 's no way the family can use six pounds of flour and three pounds of butter a week . "  | " And what about the orange juice ? I know you filched a carton of orange juice the other day . It could only have been you . " Barbara had asked the question so innocently of each of them , including the maid . Ann had wondered about the intense probing . " I admit it . It was a damned mistake . I used it for screwdrivers . I ran out . " " I 've been meaning to tell you . Those juice cartons on the ledge are ugly . " " It 's my ledge . " " And I do n't see why you have to lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's Caesar 's is Caesar 's , " he said facetiously , the logic deteriorating . " And what 's God 's , God 's . You bastard . " " I 'm not kidding about the food , Barbara . I 'm not counting the water . " her in still another confrontation . " I do n't care . " " The water ? " " Water costs , " he mumbled , but Ann could tell that his heart was n't in the argument on that issue . " All I 'm asking for is a reasonable estimate . " " You toss around that word reasonable ' as if it were from the beatitudes . " " Now you 're getting biblical . Are you going born again ' ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact . You forced it on me . " " Well , you 're not rid of me yet . " The matter , as Ann soon discovered , was resolved by an injunction . Barbara had charged harassment and violation of their maintenance agreement . Goldstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced Barbara to keep her business expenses separate . " You 've only run up our legal bills , " Jonathan told " You ca n't just run to the court every time we have  | a dispute . It 's bad enough we have to wait such a long time to resolve the main matter . But what 's the point of these interim decisions ? " " I 'm not going to let you harass me , that 's all . " " I 'm not harassing you . " For a long time after that they did not speak at all , and things appeared to settle down into an armed truce . Jonathan 's routine was unvarying , and Ann noted that he had greatly curtailed his out-of-town travel , as if leaving the house meant giving Barbara a special advantage . He would come home around midnight . After dinner at a restaurant he would go to the movies . Any movie . He carried around with him programs offered by the various repertory film theaters . He had shown them to her with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his calendar . For breakfast his secretary provided coffee and a doughnut , and a business lunch took care of his midday meal . He had explained the routine to Ann on those evenings when , with Barbara out on a catering job , she mustered the courage to accost him on his way up to his room . For some reason , she had noted , he was nervous in her presence , a condition that she greeted with even greater curiosity . " It 's no life , Ann , " he told her one evening as they stood in the foyer . " But the movies are a fantastic escape . Something about the darkened theater and all those strangers sitting beside you . Not like television . It 's a damned lonely life . " In the privacy of her thoughts , she could be outrageously blatant in her efforts to seduce him , and , more than once , these fantasies had become quite aggressive . But , near him , she could not bring herself to make a single untoward move , although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a struggle to put those  | thoughts aside . Besides , she dared not hope . Her fear of rejection was gnawing at her , and its actuality might have sent her skulking into the street , never to return . At times even their armed truce erupted into nearviolent confrontations . Once , when Ann was out , he had broken into their old room to get a bottle of Maalox he had left on the shelf of their once jointly shared medicine chest . The household was awakened by Barbara 's frantic pounding on his door . The fury of her attack frightened the children and they huddled beside Ann on the thirdfloor landing , like spectators at a bullfight . " You broke into my room , you bastard , " she had screamed . She had been supervising a late buffet and had discovered the break-in when she returned . He had opened the door and confronted her , bleary-eyed with sleep . " I needed a damned Maalox . I had a hiatus-hernia attack . " " You have no right to break into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maalox . It was too late ? " " There are all-night drugstores . " " I needed it immediately . I had no choice . I had run out . Really , Barbara , I was in pain . " " You had absolutely no right . That was a violation of our agreement . A legal violation . " " Bullshit . " " Breaking and entering . I have every intention of calling the police . " " There 's the damned phone . " He had pointed to the phone in his room and in her anger she stormed in and picked it up , dialing 911 . " I would like to report a robbery , " she said . " Barbara Rose , sixty-eight Kalorama Circle . " There was a long pause . " I 'm not certain what else was stolen . But  | I do know that a bottle of Maalox was taken . My husband broke into my bedroom . No . He did not rape me . " She took the phone away from her ear and looked into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect people . Not to ask silly questions . " She banged the phone in its cradle . He had rarely seen her so agitated and he was amused . " Feel better ? " Jonathan had asked smugly . He leaned against the doorjamb , smiling . " You had no right , " she sputtered , storming across the corridor , slamming the door behind her . " Do n't talk to me about rights , " he called to her through the door . " This house has become a loony bin , " Eve had whispered . " It 's like a television show , " Josh said . " I wonder how it 's going to come out . " Again Barbara took Jonathan to court , resulting in an injunction that Jonathan was forbidden to break into her room in the future . " Will they put him in jail if he does ? " Josh had asked his mother at the dinner table after she had announced the judge 's decision . " I 'm afraid so , " she had answered gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin on the table and run up to his room . Later , after she had comforted him , Barbara had knocked at Ann 's door . " May I come in ? " She had already opened the door . Ann was reading . " Of course . " Barbara wore a dressing gown ; her face was coldcreamed , her hair pinned back . She looked considerably younger , more unsure and vulnerable . " The worst part is having no one to talk with . At least Jonathan listened . But I always felt I was hiding something . It never seemed like the truth . " She sat  | down on the bed and bit her lip . " This is one hell of a trial by fire , Ann . It is n't half as simple as I thought . " She looked at Ann 's face , pleading . There was no avoiding the confidences about to come , Ann knew . " I suppose you think I 'm an unfeeling rat . " Barbara waited for a reply , for which Ann was grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstretched thumb ? " I hate myself for what I know in my heart I must do . If I were religious , I would think of myself as a female Job . " She bowed her head as her eyes filled with tears . They spilled down her cheeks . " I 'm not superhuman . I do n't like what all this is doing to the kids . Or even Jonathan . I just wish he would walk away and leave me alone . That 's all I ask . " She looked up at the ceiling , her lips trembling . " I suppose I could compromise . But I know I 'll regret it for the rest of my life . I have to do what I have to do . Can you understand that , Ann ? " " Please , Barbara , " Ann said gently , sitting beside her on the bed , holding her hand with sisterly affection . " Do n't put me in a position where I have to make a choice of some sort . The whole thing is heartbreaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of you . " " I 'm not a beast , Ann , " Barbara whispered . " Really , I 'm not . In my heart I know I 'm right . Looking back ... " She paused and sighed . " I felt persecuted . Helpless . We have only one life , Ann . Only one . I was n't happy . " " I 'm not here to judge , " Ann responded . But she was judging . How could Barbara be unhappy with Jonathan ? It was incomprehensible . " If only he had left the house , like an ordinary rejected spouse . " " I 'm sure it will all turn out for the best , " Ann said stupidly , disgusted with her hypocrisy . She wished she could be truly honest . She could sense Barbara 's pain .  | She understood helplessness . But Jonathan was someone special , a prize . Hurting him seemed willful , obscene . Still , she could n't hate Barbara , whose anguish , despite Ann 's feelings for Jonathan , moved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat of her cheeks , the sweet , womanly smell of her body . She felt the fullness of her large breasts . In some oddly bizarre way , the closeness reminded her of Jonathan , and she returned the embrace . " Women understand , " Barbara whispered . After a while Barbara disengaged herself and stood up , wiping her cheeks with her sleeve . " You 've been a real treasure , Ann . I want you to know that . We all owe you a debt . " Ann felt unworthy of the gratitude . It was Eve 's idea to have a Christmas tree and she and Josh and Ann dutifully set it up in the library . " I do n't care what 's going on in this house . Christmas is still Christmas , " Eve had announced , treating Ann to a long litany of the joys of family Christmases past  --  ski trips to Aspen , sunny days in the Virgin Islands and Acapulco . When they stayed at home , they would set up a Christmas tree in the library and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be a fabulous Christmas dinner and a big eggnog party for all the friends of the Roses ' , both generations . Actually , Ann had n't intended to stay with the Roses over the holidays , but they all seemed so forlorn and depressed that she felt a sense of obligation . On Christmas Eve both children were invited to parties and Barbara was out , cooking and supervising a large dinner . To keep busy Ann had welcomed the opportunity to assist Barbara in the making of pastry  | loaves , a new recipe she had concocted , which she was preparing for a Greek Embassy buffet . Barbara had been specific in her instructions , which Ann had written down and followed to the letter . The ingredients were already prepared . All she had to do was mix them . She put the beef , onion , salt , and pepper into a large mixing bowl on the kitchen island , mixed in the bread , then added wine and broth to the batter . When it had been mixed to the right consistency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put them in the refrigerator , very satisfied with her effort . Barbara had been concerned that making the pastry loaves would interfere with Christmas Day . She was determined , she had told Ann , to spend the day with the kids . Helping out was the least she could do , Ann thought self-righteously , not in the least perturbed about not spending Christmas with her parents , an exceedingly bleak prospect . Her parents invariably got blind drunk on Christmas Eve , and the day after consisted of nursing bad hangovers and coping with sometimes violent irritability . When she had washed up , Ann filled a tumbler with wine and walked to the library , where the Christmas tree stood , decorated and sprinkled with tinsel . The gifts lay wrapped and scattered around its base . She noted that , true to form , Barbara and Jonathan planned not to exchange gifts . Yet she was pleased to see that both of them had gotten gifts for her . As she contemplated what Jonathan had bought her the lights , which switched on and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to pull the plug when she heard Jonathan 's familiar step in the foyer . She had n't seen him for a week , although Eve had reported that he would attend the gift-opening on Christmas morning .  | Both apparently had agreed to be on good behavior for the sake of the children . " It 's a hell of a Christmas Eve , " he said , walking to the armoire and pouring himself a heavy scotch . " To better Christmases , " he said , raising his glass . She raised her glass in response . " Everybody 's gone , " she said , sensing her own deliberate mischief . He finished off the scotch and poured another . " I saw two Italian pictures . Down and Dirty and Bread and Chocolate . The place was nearly empty . Just one or two other losers . I would have seen the pictures over again , but they cleared the theater . Christmas Eve . The projectionist , I suppose , wanted to be home with his family . Home with his family . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . He looked up suddenly as if acknowledging her presence for the first time . " Why are n't you home with your family , Ann ? " It was a question she did n't really want to answer . " I guess I 'm needed here , " she whispered . " Good for you , Ann . At least you 're needed somewhere . I am apparently needed nowhere . Not even as an audience . " He finished his drink and squatted beside her . She had seated herself Indian style at the edge of the gifts , watching the fading , flickering lights . " I 'll fix those tonight . Wires need some soldering , I guess . " She stole a view of him in profile , then her eyes lingered . She watched his lips move . " Christmas is only for the kids anyhow , " he said . His lips began to tremble and he could not go on . She put her hand on his arm . Without turning , he put his hand on hers and pressed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ann . " He turned to look at her . " I ca n't imagine why you put up with it . I do n't know why I put up with it . None of it makes any sense , you know . Two jackasses rolling around in the mud . " " I 'm not here to judge . " She reflected suddenly that that was what she had said to Barbara . " You should have been here last Christmas . It was a real old family time . My father made a toast . You 're a lucky man , ' he said . A truly lucky man . ' He does n't understand what 's happened . He thinks I 've got a mistress and Barbara 's going through change of life . I tell him it 's neither , but he 's out of it . How do you explain this to anybody ? " " Do n't try . It 's nobody 's business , " she snapped , surprised at her assertiveness . I think it 's coping with being alone that bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's what I miss the most . " " You 'll find somebody , " she said cautiously , her heart pounding . Notice me , she begged him in her heart . " That 's out for now . Goldstein says I should cool it . I never thought my life would one day be controlled by an ex-rabbi with halitosis . " His arm played around to her shoulder . " Dear Ann , " he said . " You 're like the only anchor in this damned , stormy sea . I do n't know how we 'd survive this without you being here . And the kids . What a godsend you 've been to the kids . I 'll bet you never bargained for this when you first came here . It was one of Barbara 's better decisions , I guess . " The house was quiet . To Ann it seemed as if the earth had stopped rotating . She dared not move . His nearness was like an electric current pulsing through her . She felt his breath against her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solace , " he said . " I ca n't seem to wake up from the nightmare . " For once she resisted caution , yielding to her body 's responses . She turned to face his lips , her eyes probing his . His face moved closer and his lips reached for hers . She felt his tongue move inside her mouth , reach for hers , and , finding it , move and caress it . Her fingers reached for his hair . It had been a particular detail of her fantasy , her fingers entwining themselves in his beautiful , wavy salt-and-pepper hair . She felt his urgency , the pressing hardness , as his hands groped upward along her thighs , knowing as she opened to him how deeply she wanted him to take her and enter her as she engulfed him . Just as she touched him she felt the shuddering response in herself , startling in its ferocity , like thousands of caressing fingers on every nerve . His sudden disengagement surprised her , a wrenching movement , and a moment later she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was on her knees immediately , straightening her clothes as she kneeled , fussing with the gifts , not turning when she sensed Barbara behind her . Her heart had leaped to her throat and Jonathan had moved into the shadows behind the armoire , just out of her vision . " That you , Ann ? " Barbara called . Ann turned briefly in response . " Just rearranging the gifts . " She felt Barbara 's eyes on her back . Please do n't let her go any further , she begged , invoking God . " I 'm dead on my feet , " Barbara said . " Did you finish the mix for the pastry meat loaves ? " " Yes . " " Kids not home yet ? " " Not yet . " " Well , tomorrow is Christmas . I dread it . "  | Ann could feel the tension in the room . She held her breath , frightened that Barbara might want to talk . She did not think she could bear it . " Better get some sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann listened to Barbara 's footsteps ascending the stairs . It was only after the bedroom door had closed that Jonathan stepped from the shadows . " I 'm sorry , " he whispered . Reaching out , Ann grabbed his hand and kissed the center of the palm . He quickly drew it away in what seemed like a gesture of rejection . Or rebuke . He tiptoed into the foyer , opening the front door , creating the impression that he had just come into the house . He hurried up the stairs . Straining to listen , she heard him turn the lock of his door . She stayed in the library a long time , kneeling on the floor before the Christmas tree . Had Barbara seen them ? She would not let such speculation intrude on her happiness . Her eyes drifted upward toward the weak , flickering lights . It was only then that she realized that she had not reminded him to fix them .  | The smell of burning had set off a reaction in his dreaming mind , suggesting fire and recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand and burned down a country cabin . He was on his feet in a moment , bursting through the doorway , running down the steps in his bare feet . The branches were smoldering and the flames were just beginning to sprout like orange needles among the green . He kept an extinguisher in a closet under the stairs . Grabbing it , he rushed back to the library , where the flames had already begun to eat away at the paper wrappings of the gifts . Upending the extinguisher , he squirted the foam in large white arcs on the creeping flames . " Daddy . " It was Eve behind him , stifling a scream . " Get back , " he responded . The flames were quickly under control . But a foul , smoky smell permeated the room as he continued to pour out the contents of the extinguisher until the fire was out . " The damned lights , " he cried . " I should have fixed the lights . "  | " You 've ruined everything . " It was Barbara 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to do ? " he shot back . " Let the whole house burn down ? " " You knew they were n't working right . You knew they were dangerous . " He dropped the extinguisher , banging it on the floor , and glared at her . " I suppose I 'm being accused of ruining everybody 's Christmas . " Eve and josh had begun to poke through the remains . Most of the gifts were charred or utterly destroyed . Jonathan had bought josh a pair of binoculars , which the heat had bent out of shape . " Well , it was a nice thought , Dad , " Josh said , holding up the distorted object . " I 'll get you another pair , " Jonathan said . " What did you get me , Dad ? " Eve asked quietly , wiping her soot-stained hands on her robe . " According to your mother , a not-so-merry Christmas . " He looked at Barbara , who turned away in contempt . I saved their lives , he thought , his eyes briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had just come into the room . " Is n't it ghastly , Ann ? " Eve said . " Merry Christmas , one and all , " Josh said , holding up his binoculars and smiling at the scorched tree . Orange shafts of the early sun had begun to filter through the windows . " I guess there 's nothing left to do but clean up , " Barbara said , striding into the mess and beginning to sort out the remains . The Sarouk rug was sooty but not burned and the children rolled it away from the tree . " I hope you did n't cancel our fire insurance as well , " Barbara muttered as he stood around clumsily . " Fuck Christmas , " he said angrily , striding out of  | the room . He detested her attempt to make him feel guilty . In his room he lay on the bed and tried to ward off an oncoming massive depression . It was as if all his old values had been tortured into new shapes . They had seen only the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wavered suddenly , almost ready to accept blame . He had , indeed , forgotten to fix the lights , but had n't Ann promised to remind him ? Ann . The memory of desire stirred him , focusing his mind . His body responded and he caressed his erection . Any female who had found herself in his sights at that moment would have been fair game , he decided , dismissing the specter of any romantic involvement . That would be fatal , Goldstein had warned . " Do n't get mixed up with another woman . Not just yet , " he had intoned . " It 's safer to court Madam Palm and her five sisters . " He had been surprised at Goldstein 's levity . Besides , Ann was too young . Yet he needed a woman . Any woman . He remembered Ann 's orgasmic reaction to his embrace . So I 'm not completely sexless , he decided , like a prisoner in a dark black cell to whom any ray of light is a gift . He watched his throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind of its own . Closing his eyes , he imagined Ann naked , thighs open , waiting , nipples erect . He was plunging his erection into her , plunging deeply , urgently . He reached for it , feeling the pleasure begin , then recede . Something was intruding on the mechanism of his fantasy . He tried to fight it away , but its momentum was relentless and his body reacted . The tide of blood ebbed . He saw Barbara 's face , rebuking : " You knew they were dangerous , " she had said about the lights . Had he really ?  | Leave me alone , he pleaded . But he did not want to be left alone . Not alone . He stayed in bed most of Christmas Day , although both Eve and Josh came in to apologize or commiserate . He was n't sure which . They had opened the windows to air out the house and he had said it was all right if they went out for Christmas dinner with Barbara and Ann . He knew it troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't pressed the point . When they left , Benny jumped on his bed and burrowed his head into his chest . But he stank so badly of doggy odor that finally Jonathan had to swat him off . But the odor had given him some purposeful activity for the day . Getting dressed , he went downstairs , first taking a peek at his orchids . To his dismay , they seemed to be browning along the petal edges , an ominous sign , surprising , since only yesterday they had been in mint condition . " Do n't mock me , " he told them , proud of their beauty , especially compared with Barbara 's more pedestrian plants . He watered them , offering whispered encouragement , then went down to his workroom , lifting a shaking Benny into the big cast-iron sink , which he filled with lukewarm water . " You and me , kid . Merry Christmas , " he told the frightened dog , whose brown eyes begged relief . As he scrubbed the stinking dog he remembered inexplicably their Gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other something nonmaterial . He was a senior at Harvard Law then and they were tight for cash , barely able to survive on her job demonstrating kitchen gadgets at Macy 's . By a stroke of providence  --  he used those terms then  --  he had gotten word about the job offer with the Federal Trade  | Commission in Washington , providing , of course , that he passed the bar exam . He kept the news from her for nearly a week so that it would coincide with Christmas . He had been curious , of course , about what she had gotten him , certain that , whatever she offered , his would be the topper . " I 'm pregnant , " she told him after he had made his announcement . It was , in a way , a total deception on her part . Fair warning unheeded . He had hidden his confusion and displeasure , wondering why she had complicated their lives without consultation . The object is to control our lives , not let our lives control us , he told her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she had said . " They 're incentive . " She had sat on his lap , smothering his face with kisses . " I was worried sick you 'd scold me . But here you 've come up with that fabulous job . Perfect timing . " " The Gift of the Magi , " he had said , hugging her . " A little love child . " The feeling of uncertainty quickly passed and he remembered how by the end of that Christmas Day they had become incredibly happy . Their future had begun . He dried the dog and turned on the sauna . Leaving Benny to dry in the workroom , he went upstairs for his robe . The sauna relaxed him , sweated out his terrors , and the dry heat and wet cold that the shower provided left him mellow and relaxed . As he passed the sun-room on the way back to the sauna he noted that the browning had increased on the orchids ' petals and the stems had begun to bend . Looking closely , he inspected the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor on his fingertips was vaguely familiar , like the foam that had  | I spewed out of the fire extinguisher . It could n't be . Another sniff confirmed his suspicion . Not Barbara , he thought . Had n't she loved his orchids ? Cimbidium was one of the few species that could be nourished indoors , and getting them to grow had been both a challenge and a chore . Not Barbara . Was she capable of that ? Again he smelled his fingers . The odor was unmistakable . The confirmation removed his doubts . They were his orchids . His . For him to be the recipient of her wrath was one thing , but to vent one 's frustration on a defenseless orchid was criminal . She 's a murderess , he told himself . And a murderess must be punished . He stormed about the house , thirsting for revenge , seeking a fitting punishment for this hideous crime . He went into the kitchen . Her domain . Opening cabinets , he looked over the myriad arrays of cooking equipment and foods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then he saw the neat silver bricks in the refrigerator . Removing one , he unwrapped it and sniffed at the meat . Of course , he thought with anticipatory pleasure . He contemplated the labels on the spice rack , removing containers of ginger , curry powder , and salt . Then he poured huge quantities over the loaf , kneaded them into the mix , and reshaped it to fit the tinfoil . He repeated the process with the other six bricks , using different spices , substituting sugar for salt , relishing the impending confusion as Barbara 's customers argued among themselves what it was that had polluted the taste . In the sauna he mourned the orchids , but the manner of his revenge had more than assuaged his sense of grief . He lay back on the redwood slats and felt the delicious heat sink into his flesh . For a moment the emptiness receded as he thought of the answer he had given to her message of death .  | Harry Thurmont bore the brunt of her rage . Barbara had hurried over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek ambassador 's wife . " She said her guests were polite until two of them vomited , one directly on the table . " " That must have put a damper on things , " Thurmont said , unsuccessfully trying to hide a smile . " You 're not taking this seriously , Harry . It 's sabotage . " She was trying to control herself , to be cerebral rather than emotional . But her morning had been awful , absolutely awful . She had been summoned to the embassy at seven A.M. The ambassador and Mrs. Petrakis met her in the dining room , which smelled unmistakably of vomit . Without a word , they led her into the kitchen to view the evidence . " Taste , " the ambassador ordered . Their faces were dead white , their eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep . Barbara sniffed at the loaves , from which emanated peculiar odors . " Taste . " The ambassador repeated his order . From his wife 's face Barbara could draw no pity , and she du-  | tifully put a lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A caterer . You call yourself a caterer . You poisoned my guests . " She was too shocked to offer any explanation . Besides , her throat was paralyzed from humiliation . " At first I thought the Turks had put you up to it . " " The Turks ? " " Then I decided I would n't dignify this sort of thing by putting it on the level of a diplomatic incident . " His anger was accelerating . " It tastes like shit . Shit , " he began to shout as his wife tried to calm him . Barbara had run from the house in tears . " I really believe we have an actionable issue here , " she said calmly to Thurmont . " It 's what we 've been waiting for . He deliberately ruined the food . " The memory made her stomach turn . " Not to mention the damage to my business . The loss of a client . Thurmont stroked his chin . " You have proof ? " " Who else could it be ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the memory of Ann on Christmas Eve floated into her memory . Something barely detectable had surfaced and her mind fished for it . She had , she remembered , sensed the presence of Jonathan in the library , a fleeting sensation , just below the level of consciousness . She let the idea pass for the moment as Thurmont interrupted her thoughts . " It wo n't hold up , Barbara . We could harass . But we wo n't win in a way that will satisfy you . It wo n't get him out of the house . " " He 'll admit it . He 'll have to admit it under oath . " " Barbara , do me a favor . Stop practicing law . Becoming an object of ridicule wo n't help your case . " She felt the provocation and her anger erupted .  | " The orchids were n't a big deal . Not in comparison . " " The orchids ? " She had n't intended to tell him , but now her words overflowed . She had told about the Christmas-tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Christmas was ruined . I was throwing out buckets of foam . I saw the orchids and they made me angry . I 'm afraid it was n't very rational . Besides , I did n't know the stuff would kill them . That is , I was n't sure . I wanted them injured . Not dead . " He looked at her and shook his head in mock rebuke . She wondered when he would point a finger at her and say , Shame , shame . " The name of the game is discipline , Barbara . " " It 's easy for you to say . " " And I ca n't be available at every little crisis . " " Little crisis . " She glared at him . " Harry , I ca n't lock up my food . I intend to make this business my livelihood . Why should he interfere with that ? It 's . . . it 's cruel , heartless . " " It 's just that you need something more ... more damaging . More bizarre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering , " Barbara huffed . But what he said had triggered the errant thought again of Ann and Christmas Eve . " Something with moral turpitude , " Thurmont continued . " You need a real hook . " " Like another woman ? " " Not necessarily . " He looked at her shrewdly . " You need something that is damaging enough for a judge to say he 'd better get out . It 's a bad influence on the kids . A danger . " Jonathan was there . In the library on Christmas Eve . She was certain . She had sensed it , dismissed it . Little , innocent Ann .  | " At least one good thing has come out of this , " Thurmont said . " Jonathan can be provoked . If only the provocation was n't so obvious . The thing you must d avoid is the appearance of tit for tat . Judges do n't appreciate that . It puts everything on a lower plane and the tendency is to compromise , which is exactly what we want to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said smugly . " I wo n't be obvious . " What was obvious was that Harry Thurmont and the law could provide only the most limited of options . She was beginning to understand the process . He came around from his desk and stood before her . " I have absolutely no objection to your driving him crazy , Barbara . But if he knows you 're trying to drive him crazy , he wo n't go crazy . Do you understand that ? " " Perfectly . " She smiled demurely , thinking about her new idea . He studied her in silence for a long moment . " You look like the cat that swallowed the canary . " " Not swallowed , Harry . I 've just discovered it chirping in its cage . " She had never really thought of the conception of Eve as an act of deceit . Loving , she had believed once , was more than just being together . Loving needed something tangible to validate it . And family was n't real family without children . It was difficult now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was too foreign to the present , to the end of love . What she concluded was that her deliberate conception of Eve had not been out of love but out of fear . Perhaps it was merely intuitive at the time . Perhaps too , subconsciously , she had been frightened that her marriage was all there was or would ever be , a long , endless plateau of sameness . Jonathan , off to school each day .  | Soon he would be off to a job , with meeting people , colleagues and clients . She loved those words , so exotic , full of promise and adventure . He , doing marvelous , exciting things . She , off to work at some dead-end job , doing silly things like demonstrating kitchen gadgets or selling ladies ' underwear . Then , off to home , to prepare their dinner , to wait for her sun to rise . Him . The world was him . At the time , she must have thought it was the most wonderful way to live a life . Yet something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was so sure then that it was a child . What was a woman 's life without a child ? Nature had decreed it to happen , had n't it ? It became her most pressing ambition . To have his child . His . That was why she had named the baby Eve . Joshua had come after that time had passed , merely because it seemed indecent to have an only child , and it was carefully planned that he would arrive just when Eve started nursery school . It was a time to be practical . Looking at things in retrospect was n't really fair , she decided , deriding the idea of " fair . " Nothing was fair . Even the thought came to her in Harry Thurmont 's voice , because he had said that to her and she had been immediately convinced . " Fair is weather . Fair is not so good . Fair is a shindig . But fair is not life . " " Do you think he has any ladyfriends ? " she had asked Ann one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge colander in one of the sinks , laying out leaves of romaine lettuce for a batch of salade nicoise she was making for a luncheon later that day . It was morning . The kids had just been sent off to school and Ann was lingering over a second cup of coffee . Ann did not respond . " Ladyfriends , " Barbara repeated . " I mean it seems logical . What do you think he does every night ? After  | all , a man is different from a woman . " When Ann still had n't responded , Barbara turned toward her . " What do you think ? " she pressed . " I have no idea , " Ann answered , avoiding Barbara 's eyes . Clever bitch , Barbara thought . " He 's still a man . " " I have n't had much experience . " Barbara sensed Ann 's discomfort and proceeded cautiously . " Do you suppose he 's seeing prostitutes ? " she wondered aloud . " I doubt that . " The response was whispered , almost furtive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned again to watch her cope with her confusion , sure now that Ann was responding to the bait . " He just does n't seem like that kind of person , " Ann said , her face flushing . Barbara pressed on . " Men do n't really care where they put it . They seem to have a very low threshold of pleasure compared to women . I never did understand it . That thing of his . Always saluting . How do they carry that around with them all the time ? Like a popgun ready to go off . " She had gotten up and brought the cup and saucer to the dishwasher , sliding the rack out and placing them on it . " I hope I 'm not embarrassing you , Ann , " Barbara said . " I suppose he 's unhappy as hell . Probably thinks I put a detective on his trail . Not so . It does n't really matter . He could even have an affair in this house and it would n't matter . " She held her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann protested , unable to hide her irritation . " I know , Ann . " She paused . " Actually , I wish it would happen . Another woman might solve things for us. "  | " What about another man ? For you ? " Barbara laughed . " I 'm not going to fall into that trap so easily again . " " Trap ? " " It is a trap , Ann . " " And love ? " Ann asked . The question seemed reckless , involuntary . " Love ? What 's your opinion ? " Barbara turned in time to see Ann blush scarlet . Good , she thought , remembering love . " I have no opinion . " " Come now , Ann , " Barbara snapped . " Surely you 've had that I-can't-live-without-you feeling . That clutching of the heart , those palpitations of desire . " " I do n't think about it , " Ann replied nervously . " I 'm too busy with my studies . " " Do n't you ? " " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had gone too far . Certainly she had stirred things up . She retreated quickly , sure now of this newly discovered weapon . Yet she was fond of Ann , and using this tactic made Barbara uncomfortable . " I 'm sorry , Ann , " she said , half sincerely . " It 's beginning to get to me . All this strain . Perhaps if I went away . Maybe up to Boston to visit my parents . And took the kids . " She was being deliberately hypothetical , waiting for some reaction . But none came . Ann got up and started to move away . " What do you think ? " Barbara asked hurriedly . " About what ? " Ann asked . " About me going away for a weekend with the kids . " " I do n't know , Barbara . " You know exactly what to think , Ann , Barbara thought , laying the anchovies on the salad mound . The children 's excitement at going to Boston masked Ann 's own . She helped them pack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her , mostly about shopping and defrosting , so that Barbara would be able to meet her commitments when she came back Monday morning . Ann had also promised to feed Mercedes . " I 'll miss you all , " she cried , embracing each of them at the door , waving as they ran down the walk to the waiting taxi . She stood in the doorway for a long time , hoping they would see her lone figure . But when they had gone , she wanted to shout for joy . Alone with Jonathan . It was all she had thought about . She hoped she had successfully kept Barbara 's suspicions at bay . But that was merely a detail now . All 's fair in love and war , she thought gleefully . Not that he had ever given her the slightest encouragement , especially after his apology for the incident in the library on Christmas Eve . " I 'm sorry , " he had said , revealing both his vulnerability and his guilt .  | She took a long , lingering bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flimsy peignoir . She knew she was no physical match for Barbara . Ann 's figure was spare but well proportioned , her breasts and buttocks small . Serviceable , she told herself , reflecting on her meager experience . Nothing had moved her as much as that brief moment with Jonathan . Nothing . She had n't told Jonathan of her conversation with Barbara , which had agitated her . At the same time , it made her feel safer . Jonathan , she was certain , believed that he was being watched and conducted himself accordingly . Perhaps now , possessed of the knowledge that Barbara had given her , she could allay his fears . Nothing would have made her happier than to be the chatelaine of this lovely house . Was it a stroke of fate that Barbara had decided to divorce him so soon after she had arrived in the house ? It was incomprehensible that Barbara could reject such a good and loving man . Impossible . Ann had lit a fire in the library , selected a book from the shelves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking out his familiar step on the sidewalk and Benny 's heralding bark . To calm herself , she opened the armoire and poured some vodka . She had n't long to wait . He appeared surprised when he saw her sitting in the library . " I had n't realized , " he began . " I thought you might have gone away as well . " " Here I am . " He went to the armoire and poured himself a scotch , turning to look at her . He shook his head and smiled gently . " You drop a spark on dry kindling and you get fire , " he said , lifting his glass . " Nature 's way , " she said , smiling .  | " You 're taking advantage of a peculiar situation , " he warned with mock sarcasm . " I know . " " It wo n't do either of us any good . Certainly not yourself , Ann . " " So I 've been forewarned . " She was surprised at her boldness . He walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . Then he turned to face her . " I feel uncomfortable , " he confessed . " That last episode nearly unnerved me . " He swallowed hard and his eyes roamed over the Staffordshire pieces on the mantelpiece . " It took years to collect those pieces . " " I know , " she said . His hand swept the air . " All those beautiful things . This house . I 'm not going to let her have it , Ann . She does n't deserve it . " His belligerence was tangible , aggressive . He sat down opposite her . " There 's a lot of pain in this process . Some people might think it 's self-inflicted . I could walk away . Say good-bye . Kiss it off . And start all over again . " He looked up at her suddenly . " I 'll bet that 's what you think . Walk away and start all over again . " She was shocked at the accusatory tone . " No , " she said cautiously . " I 'm also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ignored her , still focusing on the cause of his animosity . " She 's just being ornery . A bitch , " he said . " Maybe it was there all the time . This meanness . But I was too stupid to see it . " He shook his head . " I ca n't get rid of the anger . It 's like a perpetual flame . Every time I think about it I get mad . Mad at myself . Mad at Goldstein , as if it were his fault that he 's putting me through this . Mad at Thurmont because I know the bastard is advising her . Mad at my kids for not taking my side . " He looked at her .  | " Mostly I 'm mad at myself for not having been what I thought I was . " " You 're too hard on yourself , Jonathan . " " My ego died a few months ago . " He turned away , and she saw the mist in his eyes . She moved toward him and embraced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incestuous . Opening her robe , she moved her breasts to his mouth . " Let me love you , " she begged , knowing he was beyond resisting , aching for comfort . Her cheeks felt hot and the alcohol had rushed to her head . His body shook with sobs . " Cry , darling , " she urged , caressing him . She felt the power of her womanhood as she reached for his organ , caressing it , undressing him . " You 're beautiful , " she said . He stood up and the joy of seeing him made her shiver with pleasure . Kneeling before him , she kissed him there . His response was immediate . " I 'm sorry , " he whispered . She drew him down to the couch and snuggled beside him . They lay together , hardly moving . She listened to the rhythm of his heartbeat . " Thank you , " he said when he stirred again . He opened the armoire and grabbed a vodka bottle by the neck . Then , taking her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had never been inside it since he had moved into it . The room was dusty and had a foul , musky odor . It was in complete disarray , with files and papers strewn over all available surfaces . She saw a hot plate on the open desk of the Hepplewhite secretaire and unwashed dishes on the japanned commode . Liquor bottles , some half filled , lay about the room . He caught her expression of distaste . " What did you expect ? "  | She embraced him , hoping to soothe him . But he broke away and picked up a Staffordshire figure that stood next to the dirty dishes . " Queen Victoria , " he said , pointing to the figure . " Like my life , I guess . A forgery . We got stung in Atlantic City . I keep it around to remind me of my stupidity . " His tone was ominous and she wondered if she had contributed to his mood . She watched his eyes sweep the room . " Look what 's become of my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said lamely . But he was not to be placated . " I have to hide all my personal records in here . I do n't want her to overvalue the house . I 've had to research all the receipts and insurance estimates . What a waste of time and energy . " He brought two tumblers in from the bathroom , poured some vodka , then opened the window and brought in a carton of orange juice . He poured some into the tumblers . He had spent long hours locked in this room . She had been curious about what he did there , and once she had listened at the door . There was no television set . Few books . It struck her as more of an animal 's lair than a man 's room . Among the odors she picked out was Benny 's doggy smell , noting that he had somehow followed them into the room and now lay sprawled on an Art Deco rug beside the bed . Its beige background was stained , dirty . She went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrored walls , marble floors , and goldplated plumbing fixtures . This room , too , was a mess . " I 'm not much of a housekeeper , " he said when Ann came out . " I have n't had much practice . My gen-  | eration depended too much on women . " " What about the maid ? " " I wo n't even let her in here . Barbara 's ally . " He looked at her strangely . " You think I 'm paranoid ? " The question seemed aggressive and she ignored it , sitting on the high bed . " So what are you going to do with your life , Ann ? " he asked suddenly , as if dismissing his own gloomy thoughts . " Jefferson is my life for the present , " she mumbled . I 'd like to be included in yours , she told him silently . He looked at her kindly and touched her bare shoulder . " You 're a gift , Ann . A gift to the children . A special gift to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pained her now . She felt a sense of her inferiority , but dared not ask him for comparisons . " I 'm not just giving , Jonathan . I 'm taking , also . " He stopped caressing her . " Now you sound like her . " She felt a wave of panic . She had acquired a sense of independence and a posture of equality . It did not seem queer to voice her affection in those terms . She saw the gap now . He was of a different generation , with a different way of looking at women . So that 's it , she decided , feeling odd waves of insight , as well as a sense of alliance with Barbara . " Nobody wants to be dependent anymore , " he said gloomily . " Whatever happened to man the hunter , man the protector ? " " Some people just do n't accept the idea of males being lord and master anymore . " " I was n't , really . We were a team . I was supportive of all her attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bitch was lying to me all those years ? It was an act . " His features became rigid . " Maybe this is an act as well . " He pouted . " It 's no act , " she said , determined to overlook his anger . " I 'm a little wary of the sincerity of women . " He sighed . " Now you 're generalizing , " she replied sensibly , scolding , yet trying to keep an air of lightness between them . " Maybe so , " he agreed . " I have n't known too many women . And the one woman I thought I knew I did n't know at all . That 's what bugs me the most , the imprecision of my understanding of her , of what she was feeling and thinking all those years . " He looked at Ann , then gave a sigh of resignation . " I do n't think I 'll ever again be able to believe what a woman tells me , or shows me . " " I can understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender . Lots of dirty little secrets that we 've been conditioned to suppress . " " So have men , " he replied quickly . " Well , then , now that we understand each other ... " She reached out to him and drew him to her . They made love slowly , tenderly , with less greed and transience than before . This time he did not preempt the act . Finally , he rolled over and lay beside her , their fingers locked together . Turning toward him , she watched his eyelids flutter . " There is one thing , " she whispered . " Why the house ? Why ? Considering that the family has already been split apart . It 's only a thing . And all the possessions inside it are things . Why all the pain over the house ? " His eyelids fluttered open . " A thing ? You do n't understand . It 's the whole  | world . Why should I let her take the whole world with her ? " " But it 's also part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be shared any longer . Not like this . " " Then why do n't you simply sell it and split the value ? " " I 'm willing to give her half the value . I paid for it . My brains . My sweat . Christ . " He was frowning and she had the impression he was talking by rote , like an actor going over his lines in rehearsal . Suddenly he stopped talking and was staring at something on top of the bed canopy . " What is it , Jonathan ? " she asked . He moved leisurely from the bed and crossed the room . Slowly , with quiet deliberation , he moved a chair to a corner of the room and stood on it . He was naked and the act seemed odd and incongruous . She lifted herself on one elbow to observe him , but before she could speak he shook his head and put a finger to his lips . Stretching , he peered over the canopy 's side , then stepped down again . He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips , he quietly opened the door and went into the corridor . By then she was too curious to stay and she followed him into Eve 's room , which was next to his . Ignoring her , he kneeled and began to feel along the baseboard . Then , finding a wire , he traced it along the side of one of Eve 's bookcases . It snaked through a tiny hole near the floor . " Bastards , " he muttered , crawling , following the wire . It led from Eve 's room , along the baseboard of the corridor , then upward again , to the window overlooking the garden . He bounded down the back stairs . She followed quickly behind him . He was lost in concentration . She watched him select a big knife from the wooden box on the kitchen island . Curiosity gave way to
