" I SUPPOSE the more important question is whether you believe Stinhurst 's story , " St. James pointed out to Lynley . They were in their corner bedroom , where the northwest wing of the house met the main body . It was a small room , adequatelyfurnished in beechwood and pine , inoffensively papered with stripes of creeping jenny on a field of pale blue . The air held that vaguely medicinal smell of cleanser and disinfectant , disagreeablebut not overwhelming . From the window , Lynley could see across a recess to the west wing where Irene Sinclair was moving listlessly in her room , a dress draped over her arm as if she could n't decide whether to put it on or to forget the business entirely . Her face looked etiolated , an elongated white oval framed by black hair , like an artist 's study of the power of contrast . Lynley dropped the curtain and turned to find that his friend had begun changing his clothes for dinner . It was an , awkward ritual , made worse because St. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the entire need for assistance in what for anyone else would have been a simple procedure had its genesis on a single night of Lynley 's own drunken carelessness . He watched St. James , caught between wanting to offer him help and knowing that the offer would be politely rebuffed . The leg brace was uncovered , the crutches were used , the shoes were untied , and always St. James ' face remained entirely indifferent , as if he had not been lithe and athletic a mere decade before.  | " Stinhurst 's story had the ring of truth , St. James . It 's not exactly the kind of tale one spins to get out of a murder charge , is it ? What could he possibly hope to gain from disparaging his own wife ? If anything , the case against him looks blacker now . He 's given himself a solid motive for murder . " " One that ca n't be verified , " St. James argued mildly , " unless you check with Lady Stinhurst herself . And something tells me that Stinhurst is betting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll do it , of course . If it becomes necessary . " St. James dropped one of his shoes onto the floor and began attaching his leg brace to another . " But let 's go beyond what he 's assuming your reaction will be , Tommy . Let 's consider for a momentthat his story is true . It would be clever of him , would n't it , to outline his motive for murder so obviously . That way you need n't dig for it , need n't be additionally suspicious when you uncover it . Taken to the extreme , you need n't even suspect him of the murder in the first place since he 's been perfectly honest with you about everything from the start . It 's clever , is n't it ? Too clever by half . And what better way to develop a crucial need to destroy the evidence than by acquiescing to Jeremy Vinney 's presence here as well , a man likely to pursue any embarrassing story once Joy was killed . " " You 're arguing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would turn it into an expose of his wife and brother 's affair . But that really does n't hold with Helen being given the room adjoining Joy 's , does it ? Or with the locked hall door . Or with Davies-Jones ' fingerprints all over that key . " St. James did n't disagree . He merely remarked , " If it comes to that , Tommy , I suppose one could say that it also does n't hold with the fact that Sydeham was alone for a part of the night . As was his wife , as it turns out . So either one of them had the opportunity to kill her . " " Opportunity , perhaps . Everyone appears to have had the opportunity . But motive is a problem . Not to mention the fact that Joy 's door was locked , so whoever did it either had access to those master keys or got in through Helen 's room . We 'll always go back to that , you see . " " Stinhurst could have had access to the keys , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here before . " " As have his wife , his daughter , and Joy . All of them with access to the keys , St. James . Even David Sydeham may have had access to them if he went down the corridor later on in the afternoon to see which room Elizabeth Rintoul had disappeared into when she sawp103him and Joanna Ellacourt arrive . But that 's stretching things , is n't it ? Why would he be curious about Elizabeth Rintoul 's hiding place ? More , why would Sydeham kill Joy Sinclair ? To spare his wife a production with Robert Gabriel ? It does n't wash . Apparently , she 's tightly under contract to appear with Gabriel anyway . Killing Joy accomplished nothing . " " We go back to that point , do n't we ? Joy 's death seems to benefit one person only : Stuart Rintoul , Lord Stinhurst . Now that she 's dead , the play that promised to be so embarrassing for him is never to be produced . By anyone . It looks bad , Tommy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " As to that  --  " A knock sounded on the door . Lynley answered it to find ConstableLonan standing in the corridor , carrying a lady 's shoulder bag that was encased in plastic . He held it stiffly before him in both hands , like a butler presenting a tray of questionable hors d'oeuvres . " It 's Sinclair 's , " the constable explained . " The inspector thought you might want to have a look at the contents before the lab goes over the bag for prints . " Lynley took it from him , laid it on the bed , and pulled on the latex gloves that St. James wordlessly passed him from the open valise at his feet . " Where was it found ? " " In the drawing room , " Lonan replied . " On the window seat behind the curtains . " Lynley looked at him sharply . " Hidden ? " " Looks like she just tossed it there the same way she tossed about everything in her room . " Lynley unzipped the plastic , slipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men watched curiously as he opened it and spilled out its contents . They comprised an interesting array of articles which Lynley sorted through slowly , dividing them into two piles . Into one pile he placed those objects common to a hundred thousand handbags hanging from the arms of a hundred thousand women : a set of keys attached to a large , brass ring , two inexpensive ballpoint pens , an opened pack of Wrigley 's , a single matchbook , and a pair of dark glasses in a new leather case . The rest of the contents went into the second pile where they attested to the fact that , like many women , Joy Sinclair had imbued even so mundane an object as a black shoulder bag with the singular stamp of her personality . Lynley thumbed through her chequebook first , scanning the entries for anything unusual and finding nothing . Apparently the woman had not been overly concerned with the statep104of her finances , since she had not balanced the book in at least six weeks . This financial nonchalance had its explanation in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of varying denominations . But neither chequebook nor wallet retained Lynley 's interestonce his eyes fell upon the final two objects Joy Sinclair had carried with her  --  an engagement calendar and a small , hand-sized tape recorder . The calendar was new , its pages scarcely having seen use at all . The weekend at Westerbrae was blocked out , as was a luncheon with Jeremy Vinney two weeks past . There were references to a theatre party , a dental appointment , some sort of anniversary , and three engagements marked Upper Grosvenor Street  --  each one crossed out as if none had been kept . Lynley turned the page to the successive month , found nothing , turned again . Here the single word P Green was written across one entire week , chapters 1  --  3 across the week after that . There was nothing else save a reference to S birthday jotted down on the twenty-fifth . " Constable , " Lynley said thoughtfully , " I 'd like to keep this for now . The contents , not the bag itself . Will you check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constable nodded and left the room . Lynley waited until the door closed behind him before he turned back to the bed , picked up the tape recorder , and with a glance at St. James switched it on . She had a perfectly lovely voice , throaty and musical . It was husky , a come-hither sort of voice with the kind of inadvertent sensuality that some women consider a blessing and others a curse . The sound switched on and off , in varying tempos with differing backgrounds  --  traffic , the underground , a quick blare of music  --  as if she grabbed the recorder out of her shoulder bag to save a sudden thought wherever it happened to strike her . " Try to put Edna off at least two more days . There 's nothing to report . Perhaps she 'll believe I 've had flu . . . . That penguin ! She used to love penguins . It 'll be perfect . . . .

Why not ask Rhys how best to approach him ? He 's good with people . He 'll be able to help . ... Rhys wants to  --  " Lynley switched off the recorder at this . He looked up to find St. James watching him . In a play for time before the inevitable came into the open between them , Lynley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic bag which St. James had produced from his valise . He folded it closed , took it to the chest of drawers . " Why have n't you questioned Davies-Jones ? " St. James asked . Lynley returned to the foot of the bed , to his suitcase which lay on a luggage stand there . Flipping this open , he pulled out his dinner clothes , giving himself time to consider his friend 's question . It would be easy enough to say that the initial circumstances had not allowed him to question the Welshman , that there was a logic to the manner in which the case had developed so far and he had intuitively followed the logic to see where it would lead . There was truth in that explanation as well . But beyond that truth , Lynley recognised an additional , unpleasant reality . He was struggling with a need to avoid confrontation , a need with which he had not yet come to terms , so foreign was it to him . In the next room , he could hear Helen , her movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus a thousand and one times over the years , heard her without noticing . The sounds were amplifiednow , as if with the intention of imprinting themselves permanentlyonto his consciousness . " I do n't want to hurt her , " he said at last . St. James was attaching his leg brace to a black shoe , and he paused in the effort , shoe in one hand , brace in the other . His face , usually so noncommittal , reflected surprise . " You 've certainly an odd way of showing it , Tommy . " " You sound just like Havers . But what would you have me do ? Helen 's determined to be absolutely blind to the obvious . Shall I point out the facts to her now , or hold my tongue and let her become even more involved with the man so that she 's thoroughly devastated when she discovers how he 's used her ? " " If he 's used her , " St. James said . Lynley pulled on a clean shirt , buttoned it in a poorly hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just what do you conjecturehis visit to her room last night was all about , St. James ? " His question was met with no reply . Lynley could feel his friend 's eyes on his face . His fingers fumbled with the mess he had made of his tie . " Oh , damn and blast ! " he muttered savagely.  |p106AT  THE KNOCK , Lady Helen opened her door , expecting to find Sergeant Havers or Lynley or St. James in the corridor , ready to escort her to dinner as if she were either the prime suspect or a key witness in need of police protection . Instead , it was Rhys . He said nothing , his expression hesitant , as if he was wondering what his reception might be . But when Lady Helen smiled , he entered the room and pushed the door shut behind him . They looked at each other like guilty lovers , hungry for a surreptitiousmeeting . The need for quiet , for stealth , for a declaration of unity heightened sensitivity , heightened desire , heightened and strengthened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms , Lady Helen more than willingly sought their refuge . With a wordless longing , he kissed her forehead , her eyelids , her cheeks , and at last her mouth . Her lips parted in response and her arms tightened round him , holding him closer to her as if his presence might obliterate the worst of the day . She felt the length of his body create its sweet agony of pressure against her own , and she began to tremble , shot through with a dizzying , unexpected bolt of desire . It came upon her from nowhere , running through her blood like a liquid fire . She buried her face against his shoulder , and his hands moved upon her with possessive knowledge . " Love , love , " Rhys whispered . He said nothing more , for at his words , she turned her head and sought his mouth again . After some moments , he murmured , " Aw bey browden on ye , lassie , " and then added with a torn chuckle , " But I suppose you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth his hair back from his temples where it was peppered with grey . She smiled , feeling somehowcomforted and not entirely certain why this should be so . " Where on earth did a black-hearted Welshman ever learn to speak Scots ? " At that , his mouth twisted , his arms stiffened momentarily , and Lady Helen knew before he answered that she had innocently asked the wrong question . " In hospital , " he said . " Oh Lord . I 'm so sorry . I did n't think  --  " Rhys shook his head , pulled her closer to him , resting his cheek against her hair . " I 've not told you about any of it , have I , Helen ? I think it 's something I did n't want you to know . " " Then do n't  --  " " No . The hospital was just outside of Portree . On Skye . In the dead of winter . Grey sea , grey sky , grey land . Boats leaving for thep107mainland with me wishing to be on any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to drink on a permanent basis . That kind of place tests one 's mettle as nothing else ever does . To survive , it all came down to clandestine pulls at a whisky bottle or proficiency in Scots . I chose Scots . That , at least , was guaranteed by my roommate , who refused to speak anything else . " His fingers touched her hair , a mere ghost of a caress . It seemed tentative , unsure . " Helen . For God 's sake . Please . I do n't want your pity . " It was his way , she thought . It was always his way . He would cut through like that , moving past the potential of any meaningless expression of compassion that stood between him and the rest of the world . For pity kept him at a disadvantage , prisoner of an illness that could not be cured . She took his pain as her own . " How could you ever believe I feel pity ? Is that what you think was between us last night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . Do you know that , Helen ? Is that fifteen years your senior ? Good God , is it more ? " " Twelve years . " " I was married once , when I was twenty-two . Toria was nineteen . Both of us fresh from the regionals and thinking we 'd become the next West End wonders . " " I did n't know that . " " She left me . I 'd been doing a winter 's season round Norfolk and Suffolk  --  two months here , a month there . Living in grimy bed-sits and foul-smelling hotels . Thinking none of it was really half bad since it put food on the table and kept the children in clothes . But when I got back to London , she was gone , home to Australia . Mum and Dad and security . More than mere bread on the table . Shoes on her feet . " His eyes were bleak . " How long had you been married ? " " Only five years . But quite long enough , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . " " Do n't say  --  " " Yes . I 've only seen my children once in the past fifteen years . They 're teenagers now , a boy and a girl who do n't even know me . And the worst of it is that it 's my own fault . Toria did n't leave because I was a failure in the theatre , although God knows my chances of success were fairly dim . She left because I was a drunkard . I still am . A drunkard , Helen . You must never forget that . I must n't let you forget it . " She repeated what he had said himself one night as they walkedp108together against the wind along the edge of Hyde Park : " Well , it 's only a word , is n't it ? It only has the power we 're willing to give it . " He shook his head . She could feel the heavy beating of his heart . " Have they questioned you yet ? " she asked . " No . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he spoke over her head carefully , as if each word was chosen with deliberation . " They do think I killed her , do n't they , Helen ? " Her arms tightened of their own volition , speaking the answer for her . He went on . " I 've been considering how they might think I did it . I came to your room , brought you cognac to make you drunk , made love to you as a distraction , then stabbed my cousin . Why , of course , remains to be seen . But no doubt they 'll think of something soon enough . " " The cognac was unsealed , " Lady Helen whispered . " Do they think I put something in it ? Good God . And what about you ? Do you think that as well ? Do you think I came to you , intent upon drugging you and then murdering my cousin ? " " Of course not . " Looking up , Lady Helen saw a mixture of fatigue and sadness melt together on his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bed , I unsealed it , " he said . " God knows I wanted the stuff . I felt desperate to have it . But then you woke up . You came to me . And frankly , I discovered that I wanted you more . " " You do n't need to tell me . " " I was inches from a drink . Centimetres . I have n't felt like that in months . If you had n't been there ... " " It does n't matter . I was there . I 'm here now . " Voices came to them from the room next door : Lynley 's raised hotly for a moment , followed by St. James ' placid murmur . They listened . Rhys spoke . " Your loyalties are going to be tested brutally through this , Helen . You know that , do n't you ? And even if you 're presented with irrefutable truths , you 're going to have to decide for yourself why I came to your room last night , why I wanted to be with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of all , what I was doing all that time while you slept . " " I do n't need to decide , " Lady Helen declared . " There are n't two sides to this story as far as I 'm concerned . " Rhys ' eyes darkened to black . " There are . His and mine . And you know it . "  |p109WHEN  ST . JAMES and Lynley entered the drawing room , they saw it was destined to be a most unpleasant dinner . The assembled group could not have placed themselves across the oriental carpet with any more effective staging to depict their displeasure with the fact that they would be sitting down to dine with New Scotland Yard . Joanna Ellacourt had selected a centre-stage location . Having established herself somewhere between sitting and draping on a rosewood chaise near the fireplace , she favoured the two newcomers with a glacial look before she turned away , sipped on what looked like white-capped pink syrup , and cast her eyes upon the George II chimneypiece as if its pale green pilasters needed memorising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs ; their desultoryconversation ceased entirely at the entrance of the two men . Lynley 's eyes swept over the group , making a quick note of the fact that some of them were missing , making especial note of the fact that among the missing were Lady Helen and Rhys DaviesJones . At a drinks trolley at the far end of the room , Constable Lonan sat like a guardian angel , keeping sharp eyes on the company as if in the expectation that one or more of them might commit some new act of violence . Lynley and St. James went to join him . " Where are the others ? " Lynley asked . " Not down yet , " Lonan replied . " The one lady just got in here herself . " Lynley saw that the lady in question was Lord Stinhurst 's daughter , Elizabeth Rintoul , and she was approaching the drinks trolley like a woman going to her execution . Unlike Joanna Ellacourt , who had dressed for the dinner in clinging satin as if it were a social occasion of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green sweater , both decidedly old and ill-fitting , the latter decorated with three moth holes that made an isosceles triangle high on her left shoulder . She was , Lynley knew , thirty-five years old , but she looked far older , like a woman approaching spinsterly middle age in the worst possible way . Her hair , perhaps in an unsuccessful attempt to achieve strawberry blonde , had been coloured an artificial shade of brown that had since gone brassy . It was heavily permed so that it formed a screen from behind which she could observe the world . Both the colour and the style suggested a choice made from a magazine photograph and not one that took into consideration the demands of her complexion or the shape of her face . She was very gaunt , with features that were pinched and pointed . Her upper lip was beginning to develop the creasing lines of age.  |p110Uneasiness  limned itself on her bloodless face as she crossed the room . One hand caught at her skirt and squeezed the material . She did n't bother to introduce herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was clear that she had waited more than twelve hours to ask her question and was not about to be put off another moment . Nonetheless , she did n't actually look at Lynley as she spoke . Her eyes  --  shadowed inexpertly with a peculiar shade of aquamarine  --  merely touched his face to establish contact and from that moment forward remained riveted on the wall just beyond him , as if she were addressing the painting that hung there . " Do you have the necklace ? " she asked stiffly . " I beg your pardon ? " Elizabeth 's hands splayed out against her skirt . " My aunt 's pearl necklace . I gave it to Joy last night . Is it in her room ? " There was a murmur from the group at the fireplace , and FrancescaGerrard got to her feet . Coming to Elizabeth 's side , she put her hand on her elbow , attempting to draw her back to the others . She kept her eyes off the police . " It 's all right , Elizabeth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elizabeth jerked away . " It 's not all right , Aunt Francie . I did n't want to give it to Joy in the first place . I knew it would n't work . Now that she 's dead , I want you to have it back . " Still , she looked at no one . Her eyes were bloodshot , a condition that her eyeshadow only heightened . Lynley looked at St. James . " Were there pearls in the room ? " The other man shook his head . " But I took the necklace to her . She was n't in her room yet . She 'd gone to . . . So I asked him to . . . " Elizabeth stopped , her face working . Her eyes sought and then fastened on Jeremy Vinney . " You did n't give it to her , did you ? You said you would , but you did n't . What have you done with that necklace ? " Vinney 's gin and tonic stopped midway to his lips . His fingers , too plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the accusation came as a surprise . " I ? Of course I gave it to her . Do n't be absurd . " " You 're lying ! " Elizabeth shrilled . " You said she did n't want to talk to anyone ! And you put it in your pocket ! I heard the two of you in your room , you know ! I know what you were after ! But when she would n't let you do it , you followed her back to her room , did n't you ? You were angry ! You killed her ! And then you took the pearls as well ! "  |p111Vinney  was on his feet at that , a quick man in spite of the weight he carried . He tried to push aside David Sydeham , who grabbed his arm . " You dried-up little shrew , " he flared . " You were so goddamned jealous of her , you probably killed her yourself ! Snooping about , listening at doors . That 's about as close as you 've come to having any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " And what were you doing with her ? " Angry colour shot across Elizabeth 's cheeks in patches . Her lips contorted into a sneer . " Hoping to get your own creative juices up by bleeding off hers ? Or smelling her up like every other man here ? " " Elizabeth ! " Francesca Gerrard pleaded weakly . " Because I know why you came ! I know what you were after ! " " She 's mad , " Joanna Ellacourt muttered in disgust . Lady Stinhurst broke at that . She spat a response at the actress . " Do n't you say that ! Do n't you dare ! You sit there like an ageing Cleopatra who needs men to  --  " " Marguerite ! " Her husband 's voice boomed . It shattered everyoneto silence , nerve-strung and brittle . The tension was broken by footsteps on the stairs and in the hall . A moment later the remaining members of the party entered the room : Sergeant Havers , Lady Helen , Rhys Davies-Jones . Robert Gabriel appeared less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group by the fireplace to the others near the drinks trolley , to Elizabeth and Vinney , squaring off in anger . It was an actor 's moment and he knew how to use it . " Ah . " He smiled gaily . " We are indeed all in the gutter , are n't we ? But I wonder which of us are looking at the stars ? " " Certainly not Elizabeth , " Joanna Ellacourt replied curtly and turned back to her drink . From the corner of his eye , Lynley saw Davies-Jones draw Lady Helen towards the drinks trolley and pour her a dry sherry . He even knows her habits , Lynley thought dismally and decided that he had had his fill of the entire group . " Tell me about the pearls , " he said . Francesca Gerrard felt for the single string of cheap beads she wore . They were puce-coloured ; they argued dramatically with the green of her blouse . Ducking her head , raising a nervous hand to her mouth as if to hide her prominent teeth from scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better manners told her it was unwise to intrude.  | " I . . . It 's my fault , Inspector . I 'm afraid that last night I did ask Elizabeth to offer the pearls to Joy . They are n't priceless , of course , but I thought if she needed money .... " " Ah . I see . A bribe . " Francesca 's eyes went to Lord Stinhurst . " Stuart , wo n't you ... ? " The words wavered uneasily . Her brother did n't reply . " Yes . I thought she might be willing to withdraw the play . " " Tell him how much the pearls are worth , " Elizabeth insisted hotly . " Tell him ! " Francesca made a delicate moue of distaste , clearly unused to discussing such matters in public . " They were a wedding present from Phillip . My husband . They were . . . perfectly matched so  --  " " They were worth more than eight thousand pounds , " Elizabeth snapped . " I had of course always intended to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no children  --  " " They were going to go to our little Elizabeth , " Vinney finished triumphantly . " So who better to have nicked them from Joy 's room ? You nasty little bitch ! Clever to point the finger at me ! " Elizabeth made a precipitate move towards him . Her father rose and intercepted her . The entire scene was about to be lived through once again . But Mary Agnes Campbell arrived in their midst , coming to stand hesitantly in the doorway , her eyes large and round , her fingers playing at the tips of her hair . Francesca spoke to her in an effort to divert the tide of passion . " Dinner , Mary Agnes ? " she asked inanely . Mary Agnes scanned the room . " Gowan ? " she responded . " He isna wi ' ye ? Nae wi ' the police ? Cuik wants him . . . " Her voice fell off . " Ye havena seen ... " Lynley looked from St. James to Havers . All of them shared a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one leaves the room , " Lynley directed Constable Lonan . THEY WENT in separate directions , Havers up the stairs , St. James down the lower northeast corridor , and Lynley into the dining room , through the china and warming rooms . He burst into the kitchen . The cook started in surprise , a steaming kettle in her hand . Broth spilled over the side in an aromatic stream . Above them , Lynley heard Havers pounding down the west corridor . Doors crashed open . She called the boy 's name . Seven steps and Lynley was at the scullery door . The knob turnedp113in his hand , but the door would n't open . Something blocked the passage . " Havers ! " he shouted , and in rising anxiety at the absence of reply , " Havers ! Damn and blast ! " Then he heard her flying down the back staircase , heard her pause , heard her cry of incredulity , heard the unbelievable sound of water , the sound of sloshing like a child in a wading pond . Precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draught of medicine one expects but hopes not to swallow : " Gowan ! Christ ! " " Havers , for God 's sake  --  " There was movement , something dragging . The door eased open a precious twelve inches , giving Lynley access to the heat and the steam and the heart of malevolence . His back muddied and gummed by crimson , Gowan had been lying on his stomach across the top step of the scullery , apparently in an effort to escape the room and the scalding water that poured from the boiler and mixed with the cooling water on the floor . It was inches deep , and Havers waded back across it , seeking the emergency valve that would shut it off . When she found it , the room was plunged into an eerie stillness that was broken by the cook 's voice on the other side of the door . " Is it Gowan ? Is it the lad ? " And she began a keening that reverberated like a musical instrument against the kitchen walls . But when she paused , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was alive . Lynley turned the boy to him . His face and neck were a puckered , red mass of boiled flesh . His shirt and trousers were cooked onto his body . " Gowan ! " Lynley cried . And then , " Havers , phone for an ambulance ! Get St. James ! " She did not move . " Blast it , Havers ! Do as I say ! " But her vision was transfixed on the boy 's face . Lynley spun back , saw the initial glazing of Gowan 's eyes , knew what it meant . " Gowan ! No ! " For an instant , Gowan seemed to try desperately to respond to the shout , to accept the call back from the darkness . He took a stertorous breath , wracked with bloody phlegm . " Did n't . . . see ... " " What ? " Lynley urged . " Did n't see what ? " Havers leaned forward . " Who ? Gowan , who ? " With an enormous effort , the boy 's eyes sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered once and was still.  |p114LYNLEY  FOUND that he had grasped hold of Gowan 's shirt in a frantic attempt to infuse his tortured body with life . Now he released him , letting the corpse rest back upon the step , and a monumental sense of outrage filled him . It began as a howling , curling deep within muscles , tissues , and organs , screaming to get out . He thought of the wasted life  --  the generations of life callously destroyed  --  in the single young boy who had done . . . what ? Who had paid for what crime ? What chance remark ? What piece of knowledge ? His eyes burned , his heart pounded , and for a moment he chose to ignore the fact that Sergeant Havers was speaking to him . Her voice broke wretchedly . " He pulled the ruddy thing out ! Oh my God , Inspector , he must have pulled it out ! " Lynley saw that she had gone back to the boiler in the corner of the room . She was kneeling on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel in her hand . Using it , she lifted something from the pool and Lynley saw it was a kitchen knife , the very same knife he had seen in the hands of the Westerbrae cook a few short hours before.  |p115THERE  WAS N'T ENOUGH space in the scullery , so InspectorMacaskin did his pacing in the kitchen . His left hand ran along the worktable in the centre of the room ; he gnawed at the fingers of his right with vicious concentration . His eyes flicked from the windows that presented him blankly with his own reflectionto the closed door leading towards the dining room . From there he could hear the raised wail of a woman 's voice , and the voice of a man , raw with anger . Gowan Kilbride 's parents from Hillview Farm , meeting with Lynley , flailing him mercilessly with the first fury of their grief . On the floor above them , behind closed and guarded doors , the suspects waited for their summons from the police . Again , Macaskin thought . He cursed himself soundly , his conscienceshredded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the library for dinner , Gowan Kilbride might well be alive . Macaskin swung around as the scullery door opened and St. James stepped out with Strathclyde 's medical examiner . He hurried to join them . Over their shoulders , he could see two other crimescenemen still at work in the small room , doing what they could to collect what evidence had not been obliterated by water and steam . " Right branch of the pulmonary artery is my guess without a full postmortem , " the examiner murmured to Macaskin . He was stripping off a pair of gloves , which he stuffed into his jacket pocket . Macaskin directed a querying look at St. James.  | " It could be the same killer . " St. James nodded . " Right-handed . One blow . " " Man or woman ? " St. James blew out a reflective breath . " My guess is a man . But I would n't rule out the possibility of a woman . " " But surely we 're talking about considerable strength ! " " Or a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were driven . " " Driven ? " " Blind rage , panic , fear . " Macaskin bit down too hard on his finger . He tasted blood . " But who ? Who ? " he demanded of no one . WHEN LYNLEY unlocked the door to Robert Gabriel 's room , he found the man sitting much like a solitary prisoner in a cell . He had chosen the least comfortable chair in the room and he leaned forward in it , his arms on his legs , his manicured hands dangling uselessly in front of him . Lynley had seen Gabriel on the stage , most memorably as Hamletfour seasons past , but the man close-up was very different from the actor who swept the audience along with him through the tortured psyche of a Danish prince . In spite of the fact that he was not much past forty , Gabriel was starting to look worn out . There were pouches under his eyes , and a fatty layer had begun to take up permanent residence round his waist . His hair was well cut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to encourage it into a modern style , it was thin upon his skull , artificial-looking as if he had enhanced its colour in some way . At the crown of his head , its thickness barely sufficed to cover a bald spot that made a small but growing tonsure . Youthfully dressed , Gabriel appeared to favour trousers and shirt of a colour and weight that seemed more appropriate to a summer in Miami Beach than a winter in Scotland . They were contradictions , notes of instability in a man one would expect to be self-assured and at ease . Lynley nodded Havers towards a second chair and remained standing himself . He chose a spot near a handsome hardwood chest of drawers where he had an unobstructed view of Gabriel 's face . " Tell me about Gowan , " he said . The sergeant crackled through the pages of her notebook . " I always thought my mother sounded just like the police , " was Gabriel 's weary response . " I see I was right . " He rubbed at the hackp117of his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in his chair and reached for the travel alarm clock on the bedside table . " My son gave this to me . Look at the silly thing . It does n't even keep proper time any longer , but I 've not been able to bring myself to toss it in the rubbish . I 'd call that paternal devotion . Mum would call it guilt . " " You had a row in the library late this afternoon . " Gabriel gave a derisive snort . " We did . It seems Gowan believed that I 'd been savouring one or two of Mary Agnes ' finer qualities . He did n't much like it . " " And had you ? " " Christ . Now you sound like my ex-wife . " " Indeed . That does n't go far to answering my question , however . " " I 'd spoken to the girl , " Gabriel snapped . " That 's all . " " When was this ? " " I do n't know . Sometime yesterday . Shortly after I arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly to deliver fresh towels , which I did n't need . She stayed to chat , long enough to find out if I had any acquaintance with a list of actors who appear to be running neck and neck at the top of her marital-prospect list . " Gabriel waited belligerently and when no additional question came forth he said , " All right , all right ! I may have touched her here and there . I probably kissed her . I do n't know . " " You may have touched her ? You do n't know if you kissed her ? " " I was n't paying attention , Inspector . I did n't know I would have to account for every second of my time with the London police . " " You talk as if touching and kissing are knee-jerk reactions , " Lynley pointed out with impassive courtesy . " What does it take for you to remember your behaviour ? Complete seduction ? Attempted rape ? " " All right ! She was willing enough ! And I did n't kill that boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at least enough conscience to look uncomfortable . " Good God , just a bit of nuzzle . Perhaps a feel beneath her skirt . I did n't take the girl to bed . " " Not then , at least . " " Not at all ! Ask her ! She 'll tell you the same . " He pressed his fingers to his temples as if to quell pain . His face , bruised from his run-in with Gowan , looked riven by exhaustion . " Look , I did n't know Gowan had his eye on the girl . I had n't even seen him then . I did n't know he existed . As far as I was concerned , she was free for the taking . And , by God , she did n't protest . She could hardly dop118that , could she , when she was doing her best to manage a feel of her own . " The actor 's last statement rang with a certain pride , the kind evidenced by men who feel compelled to talk about their sexual conquests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the speaker it always meets some undefined need . Lynley wondered what it was in Gabriel 's case . " Tell me about last night , " he said . " There 's nothing to tell . I had a drink in the library . Spoke to Irene . After that , I went to bed . " " Alone ? " " Yes , as hard as that may be for you to believe , alone . Not with Mary Agnes . Not with anyone else . " " That takes away an alibi , though , does n't it ? " " Why in God 's name would I need an alibi , Inspector ? Why would I want to kill Joy ? All right , I had an affair with her . I admit my marriage fell apart because of it . But if I wanted to kill her , I would have done so last year when Irene found out and divorced me . Why wait until now ? " " Joy would n't cooperate in the plan you had , would she , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Irene would come back to you if Joy would tell her that she 'd been to bed with you only once . Not again and again over a year , but once . Except that Joy had no intention of lying to benefit you . " " So I killed her because of that ? When ? How ? There 's not a person in the house who does n't know her door was locked . So what did I do ? Hide in the wardrobe and wait for her to fall asleep ? Or better yet , tiptoe back and forth through Helen Clyde 's room and hope she would n't notice ? " Lynley refused to let himself become involved in a shouting match with the man . " When you left the library this evening , where did you go ? " " I came here . " " Immediately ? " " Of course . I wanted a wash . I felt like hell . " " Which stairs did you use ? " Gabriel blinked . " What do you mean ? What other stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not those right next door to this very room ? The back stairs ? The stairs in the scullery ? " " I had no idea they were even there . It 's not my habit to prowlp119about houses looking for secondary access routes to my room , Inspector . " His answer was clever enough , impossible to verify if no one had seen him in the scullery or the kitchen within the last twenty-four hours . Yet certainly Mary Agnes had used the stairs when she worked on this floor . And the man was n't deaf . Nor were the walls so thick that he would hear no footsteps . It appeared to Lynley that Robert Gabriel had just made his first mistake . He wondered about it . He wondered what else the man was lying about . Inspector Macaskin poked his head in the door . His expression was calm , but the four words he said held a note of triumph . " We 've found the pearls . " " THE GERRARD woman had them all along , " Macaskin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man got to her room for the search . I 've put her in the sitting room . " Sometime since their earlier meeting that night , Francesca Gerrardhad decided to deck herself out in a grating array of costume jewellery . Seven strands of beads in varying colours from ivory to onyx had joined those of puce , and she was sporting a line of metallic bracelets that made her movements sound as if she were in shackles . Discoidal plastic earrings striped violently in purple and black were clipped to her ears . Yet the tawdry display seemed the product of neither eccentricity nor self-absorption . Rather , it appeared however questionably to be a substitute for the ashes which women of other cultures pour upon their heads at the time of a death . Nothing was quite so clear as the fact that Francesca Gerrard was grieving . She sat at the table in the centre of the room , one arm pressed tightly into her waist , one fist clenched between her eyebrows . Swaying slowly from side to side , she wept . The tears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was faced with the real thing . " Get something for her , " he said to Havers . " Whisky or brandy . Sherry . Anything . From the library . " Havers went to do so , returning a moment later with a bottle and several glasses . She poured a few tablespoons of whisky into one of the tumblers . Its smoky scent struck at the air like a sound . With a gentleness unusual in her , Havers pressed the glass into Francesca 's hand . " Drink a hit , " she said . " Please . Just to steady yourself . "  | " I ca n't ! I ca n't ! " Nonetheless , Francesca allowed Sergeant Haversto lift the glass to her lips . She took a grimacing swallow , coughed , took another . Then she said brokenly , " He was . . . I liked to pretend he was my son . I 've no children . Gowan . . . It 's my fault that he 's dead . I asked him to work for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to London . He wanted to be like James Bond . He had dreams . And he 's dead . And I 'm to blame . " Like people afraid of making any sudden movements , the others in the room took seats surreptitiously , Havers at the table with Lynley , St. James and Macaskin out of Francesca 's line of vision . " Blame is part of death , " Lynley said quietly . " I bear equal responsibility for what 's happened to Gowan . I 'm not likely to forget it . " Francesca looked up , surprised . Clearly , she had not expected such an admission from the police . " Part of myself feels lost . It 's as if . . . No , I ca n't explain . " Her voice quavered , then held . Any man 's death diminishes me , because I am involved in mankind . Exposed for years to death in a thousand and one horrible varieties , Lynley understood far better than Francesca Gerrard could ever have realised . But he said only , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burial of grief comes hand-in-hand with justice . Not at once , of course . But eventually . " " And you need me for that . Yes . I do understand . " She drew herself up , blew her nose shakily on a wadded tissue from her pocket , took another hesitant sip of whisky . Her eyes brimmed with tears again . Several escaped in a wet trail from cheeks to lips . " How did you come to have the necklace in your room ? " Lynley asked . Sergeant Havers took out her pencil . Francesca hesitated . Her lips parted twice to speak before she was able to go on . " I took it back last night . I would have told you earlier in the drawing room . I wanted to . But when Elizabeth and Mr. Vinney began ... I did n't know what to do . Everything happened so quickly . And then Gowan . . . " She faltered on the name , like a runner stumbling and not righting himself properly . " Yes . I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did she bring it to you ? " " I went to her room . It was on the chest of drawers by the door . I suppose I had changed my mind about her having it . " " You took it back as easily as that ? There was no discussion ? " Francesca shook her head . " There could n't have been . She was asleep . "  | " You saw her ? You got into her room ? Was the door unlocked ? " " No . I 'd gone without my keys because I thought at first it might be unlocked . Everyone knew each other , after all . There was no reason to lock doors . But hers was locked , so I went to the office for the master keys . " " The key was n't in her lock from the inside ? " Francesca frowned . " No . . . It could n't have been , could it , or I would n't have been able to unlock it with my own . " " Take us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willingly , Francesca retraced her route from her bedroom to Joy 's where she turned the door handle only to find the room locked ; from Joy 's room to her own where she picked up her desk key from her chest of drawers ; from her room to her office where she took the master keys from the bottom drawer of her desk ; from her office to Joy 's room where she unlocked the door quietly , saw the necklace in the light from the corridor , took it , and relocked the door ; from Joy 's room to her office where she returned the keys ; from her office back to her own room where she replaced the necklace in her jewellery box . " What time was this ? " Lynley asked . " Three-fifteen . " " Exactly ? " She nodded and went on to explain . " I do n't know whether you 've ever done anything impulsive that you regret , Inspector . But I regretted parting with the pearls directly after Elizabeth took them to Joy . I lay in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a confrontation with Joy , I did n't want to burden my brother Stuart with anything else . So I . . . well , I suppose I stole them , did n't I ? And I know it was three-fifteen because I had been lying awake watching the clock and that 's what time it was when I finally decided to do something about getting my necklace back . " " You said Joy was asleep . Did you see her ? Hear her breathing ? " " The room was so dark . I . . . I suppose I assumed she was asleep . She did n't stir , did n't speak . She ... " Her eyes widened . " Do you mean she might have been dead ? " " Did you actually see her in the room at all ? " " You mean in the bed ? No , I could n't see the bed . The door was in the way and I had n't opened it more than a few inches . I just thought , of course ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked ? " " Oh yes , " she replied . " It 's always locked . " " Who has keys to it ? "  | " I have one key . Mary Agnes has the other . " " And could anyone have seen you going from your room to Joy 's ? Or going to the office ? On either of the two trips ? " " I did n't notice anyone . But I suppose . . . " She shook her head . " I just do n't know . " " But you would have passed any number of rooms to make the trips , would n't you ? " " Of course , anyone on the main corridor could have seen me if they were up and about . But surely I would have noticed that . Or heard a door opening . " Lynley went to join Macaskin who was already on his feet , examining the floor plan that was still spread out upon the table from their earlier interview with David Sydeham . Four rooms had immediate access to the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinclair : Joanna Ellacourt and David Sydeham'sroom , Lord Stinhurst and his wife 's , the unused room of Rhys Davies-Jones , and Irene Sinclair 's at the junction of the main corridorand the west wing of the house . " Surely there 's truth to what the woman is saying , " Macaskin muttered to Lynley as they looked the floor plan over . " Surely she would have heard something , seen something , been alerted to the fact that she was being watched . " " Mrs. Gerrard , " Lynley said to her over his shoulder , " are you absolutely certain that Joy 's door was locked last night ? " " Of course , " she replied . " I thought of sending a note with her tea this morning , to tell her I 'd taken the necklace back . Perhaps I really should have . But then  --  " " And you did take the keys back to your desk ? " " Yes . Why do you keep asking me about the door ? " " And you locked the desk again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's something I always do . " Lynley turned from the table but remained next to it , his eyes on Francesca . " Can you tell me , " he asked her , " how Helen Clyde came to be given a room adjoining Joy Sinclair 's ? Was that coinciden-tal ? " Francesca 's hand rose to her beads , an automatic movement , companion to thought . " Helen Clyde ? " she repeated . " Was it Stuart who suggested . . . No . That 's not right , is it ? Mary Agnes took the call from London . I remember because Mary 's spelling is a bit phonetic , and the name she 'd written was unfamiliar . I had to get her to say it for me . " " The name ? "  | " Yes . She 'd written down Joyce Encare , which of course made no sense until she said it . Joy Sinclair . " " Joy had telephoned you ? " " Yes . So I returned the call . This was . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Helen Clyde might have the room next to hers . " " Joy asked for Helen ? " Lynley queried sharply . " Asked for her by name ? " Francesca hesitated . Her eyes dropped to the plan of the house , then rose back to meet Lynley 's . " No . Not exactly by name . She merely said that her cousin was bringing a guest and could that guest be given the room next to hers . I suppose I assumed she must have known . . . . " Her voice faltered as Lynley pushed himself away from the table . He looked from Macaskin to Havers to St. James . There was no point in further procrastination . " I 'll see Davies-Jones now , " he said . RHYS DAVIES-JONES did not appear to be cowed in the presence of the police , in spite of the escort of Constable Lonan who had followed him like an unfortunate reputation from his room , down the stairs , and right to the door of the sitting room . The Welshman evaluated St. James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward , the deliberate look of a man intent upon showing that he had nothing to hide . A dark horse which had never been thought of . . . Lynley nodded him to a seat at the table . " Tell me about last night , " he said . Davies-Jones gave no perceptible reaction to the question other than to move the liquor bottle out of his line of vision . He played the tips of his fingers round the edge of a packet of Players that he took from his jacket pocket , but he did not light one . " What about last night ? " " About your fingerprints on the key to the door that adjoined Helen 's and Joy 's rooms , about the cognac you brought to Helen , about where you were until one in the morning when you showed up at her door . " Again , Davies-Jones did not react , either to the words themselves or to the current of hostility that ran beneath them . He answered frankly enough . " I took cognac up to her because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid of me , a rather adolescent way of getting into her room for a few minutes . " " It seems to have worked well enough . "  |p124Davies-Jones  did n't respond . Lynley saw that he was determined to say as little as possible . He found himself instantly equally determined to wring every last fact from the man . " And your fingerprints on the key ? " " I locked the door , both doors in fact . We wanted privacy . " " You entered her room with a bottle of cognac and locked both the doors ? Rather a blatant admission of your intentions , would n't you say ? " Davies-Jones ' body tensed fractionally . " That 's not how it hap-pened . " " Then do tell me how it happened . " " We talked for a bit about the read-through . Joy 's play was supposed to have brought me back into London theatre after my .. . trouble , so I was rather upset about the way everything turned out . It was more than a little bit obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting us all up here to look at the revisions in her script , putting on a play had little enough to do with it . I was angry at having been used as a pawn in what was clearly some sort of vengeance game Joy was playing against Stinhurst . So Helen and I talked . About the read-through . About what in God 's name I would do from here . Then , when I was going to leave , Helen asked me to stay the night with her . So I locked the doors . " Davies-Jones met Lynley 's eyes squarely . A faint smile touched his lips . " You were n't expecting it to have happened quite that way , were you , Inspector ? " Lynley did n't reply . Rather , he pulled the whisky bottle towards him , twisted off its cap , poured himself a drink . The liquor flashed through his body satisfactorily . Deliberately , he set the glass down on the table between them , a full inch still in it . At that , DaviesJoneslooked away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's head , the tension in his neck , traitors to his need . He lit a cigarette with unsteady hands . " I understand you disappeared right after the read-through , that you did n't show up again until one in the morning . How do you account for the time ? What was it , ninety minutes , nearly two hours ? " " I went for a walk , " Davies-Jones replied . Had he claimed that he had gone swimming in the loch , Lynley could not have been more surprised . " In a snowstorm ? With a windchillfactor of God only knows how far below freezing , you went for a walk ? " Davies-Jones merely said , " I find walking a good substitute forp125the bottle , Inspector . I would have preferred the bottle last night , frankly . But a walk seemed like the smarter alternative . " " Where did you go ? " " Along the road to Hillview Farm . " " Did you see anyone ? Speak to anyone ? " " No , " he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you . I understand that perfectly . Nonetheless , it 's what I did . " " Then you also understand that as far as I 'm concerned you could have spent that time in any number of ways . " Davies-Jones took the bait . " Such as ? " " Such as collecting what you 'd need to murder your cousin . " The Welshman 's answering smile was contemptuous . " Yes . I suppose I could have . Down the back stairs , through the scullery and kitchen , into the dining room , and I 'd have the dirk without anyone seeing me . Sydeham 's glove is a problem , but no doubt you can tell me how I managed to get it without him being the wiser . " " You seem to know a great deal about the layout of the house , " Lynley pointed out . " I do . I spent the early part of the afternoon looking it over . I'vean interest in architecture . Hardly a criminal one , however . " Lynley fingered the tumbler of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in hospital ? " he asked . " Is n't that a bit out of your purview , Inspector Lynley ? " " Nothing that touches this case is out of my purview . How long were you in hospital for your drinking problem ? " Davies-Jones answered stonily . " Four months . " " A private hospital ? " " Yes . " " Costly venture . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? That I stabbed my cousin for her money to pay my bills ? " " Did Joy have money ? " " Of course she had money . She had plenty of money . And you can rest assured she did n't leave any of it to me . " " You know the terms of her will , then ? " Davies-Jones reacted to the pressure , to being in the close presence of alcohol , to having been led so expertly into a trap . He stubbed out his cigarette angrily in the ashtray . " Yes , blast you ! And she 's left every last pound to Irene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear , is it , Inspector ? " Lynley seized the opportunity he had gained through the other man 's anger . " Last Monday boy asked Francesca Gerrard that Helenp126Clyde be given a room next to hers . Do you know anything about that ? " " That Helen . . . " Davies-Jones reached for his cigarettes , then pushed them away . " No . I ca n't explain it . " " Can you explain how she knew Helen would be with you this weekend ? " " I must have told her . I probably did . " " And suggested that she might want to get to know Helen ? And what better way than by asking to be given adjoining rooms . " " Like schoolgirls ? " Davies-Jones demanded . " Rather transparent for a ruse leading to murder , would n't you say ? " " I 'm certainly open to your explanation . " " I do n't bloody have one , Inspector . But my in the production , someone who would n't be likely to come tapping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene changes . Actors are like that , you know . They generally do n't give a playwright much peace . " " So you mentioned Helen to her . You planted the idea . " " I did nothing of the kind . You asked for an explanation . That 's the best I can do . " " Yes . Of course . Except that it does n't hold with the fact that Joanna Ellacourt had the room on the other side of Joy 's , does it ? No buffer there . How do you explain it ? " " I do n't . I have absolutely no idea what Joy was thinking . Perhaps she had no idea herself . Perhaps it means nothing and you 're looking for meaning wherever you can find it . " Lynley nodded , unaffected by the anger in the implication . " Where did you go once everyone was let out of the library this evening ? " " To my room . " " What did you do there ? " " I showered and changed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whisky . There was no noise at all save for a rustle from one of the others in the room , Macaskin fishing a roll of mints from his pocket . " I went to Helen . " " Again ? " Lynley asked blandly . His head snapped up . " What the hell are you suggesting ? " " I should guess that would be obvious enough . She 's provided several rather good alibis for you , has n't she ? First last night and now this evening . "  |p127Davies-Jones  stared at him incredulously before he laughed . " My God , that 's absolutely unbelievable . Do you think Helen 's stupid ? Do you think she 's so naive that she 'd allow a man to do that to her ? And not once , but twice ? In twenty-four hours ? What kind of a woman do you think she is ? " " I know exactly the kind of woman Helen is , " Lynley responded . " One absolutely vulnerable to a man who claims to be in possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how you played it , is n't it ? Right into her bed . If I bring her down here now , no doubt I 'll discover that this evening in her room was just another variation on last night 's tender theme . " " And by God , you ca n't bear the thought of that , can you ? You 're so sick with jealousy that you stopped seeing straight the moment you knew I 'd slept with her . Face the facts , Inspector . Do n't twist them about to pin something on me because you 're too goddamned afraid to take me on in any other way . " Lynley moved sharply in his chair , but Macaskin and Havers were on their feet at once . That brought him to his senses . " Get him out of here , " he said . BARBARA HAVERS waited until Macaskin himself had ushered Davies-Jones from the room . She watched to ensure they were left in complete privacy before she cast a long , supplicating look in St. James ' direction . He joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his reading spectacles and was looking through Barbara 's notes . The room was taking on a more than lived-in look , with glasses , plates of half-eaten food , overfull ashtrays , and notebooks scattered about . The air smelled as if a contagion were alive in it . " Sir . " Lynley raised his head and Barbara saw with a wrench that he looked awful , fagged out , drawn through a wringer of his own devising . " Let 's look at what we have , " she suggested . Over the top of his spectacles , Lynley 's eyes went from Barbara to St. James . " We have a locked door , " he replied reasonably . " We have Francesca Gerrard locking it with the only key available besides the one across the room on the dressing table . We have a man in the next room with a clear means of access . Now we 're looking for a motive . " No , Barbara thought weakly . She kept her voice even and impar/tial . " You must admit that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room adjoined each other . He could n't have known in advance about that . " " Could n't he ? A man with a self-professed interest in architecture ? There are homes with adjoining rooms all over the country . It hardly takes a university degree to guess there would be two here . Or that Joy , after specifically requesting a room by Helen 's , would be given one of them . I imagine no one else was phoning Francesca Gerrard with special requests of that nature . " Barbara refused to submit . " Francesca herself could have killed Joy as matters stand now , sir . She was in the room . She admits it . Or she could have given the key to her brother and let him do the job . " " It always comes back to Lord Stinhurst for you , does n't it ? " " No , that 's not it . " " And if you want to go with Stinhurst , what about Gowan 's death ? Why did Stinhurst kill him ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , trying to hold on to her patience , her temper , and her need to shout out Stinhurst 's motive until Lynley was forced to accept it . " For that matter , Irene Sinclair could have done it . Or Sydeham or Ellacourt , since they were both on their own . Or Jeremy Vinney . Joy was in his room earlier . Elizabeth told us as much . For all we know , he wanted Joy , got himself squarely rejected , went to her room and killed her in a fit of anger . " " And how did he lock the door when he left ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps he went out the window . " " In a storm , Havers ? You 're stretching it more than I am . " Lynley dropped her notes onto the table , removed his spectacles , rubbed his eyes . " I see that Davies-Jones had access , Inspector . I see that he had opportunity , as well . But Joy Sinclair 's play was to resurrect his career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing for certain whether the play was finished just because Stinhurst withdrew his support . Someone else well might have financed it . So it seems to me that he 's the only person in the house with a solid motive for keeping the woman alive . " St. James spoke . " No . There 's another , is n't there , if it comes to regenerating dying careers ? Her sister , Irene . " " I DID WONDER when you would get to me . " Irene Sinclair stepped back from the door . She walked to her bedp129and sat down , her shoulders slumped . In deference to the lateness of the hour , she had changed into her nightclothes , and like the woman itself , her garments were restrained . Flat-heeled slippers , a navy flannel dressing gown under which the high neck of a white nightdress rose and fell with her steady breathing . There was something , however , oddly impersonal about her clothing . It was serviceable , indeed , yet adhering strictly to a norm of perceived propriety , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life itself at bay . Lynley wondered if the woman ever slopped round the house in old blue jeans and a tattered jersey . Somehow , he doubted it . Her resemblance to her sister was remarkable . In spite of the fact that he had observed Joy only through the photographs of her death , Lynley could easily recognise in Irene those features she had shared with her sister , features unaffected by the five or six years that separated them in age : prominent cheekbones , broad brow , the slight squaring of jawline . She was , he guessed , somewhere in her early forties , a statuesque woman with the sort of body other women long for and most men dream of taking into their beds . She had a face that might have belonged to Medea and black hair in which the grey was beginning to streak back dramatically from the left peak of her forehead . Any other woman , remotely insecure , would have coloured it long ago . Lynley wondered if the thought had even crossed Irene 's mind . He studied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to stray ? " Someone has probably told you already that my sister and my husband had an affair last year , Inspector , " she began , keeping her voice low . " It 's no particular secret . So I do n't mourn her death as I ought to , as I probably shall eventually . It 's just that when your life 's been torn apart by two people you love , it 's difficult to forgive and forget . Joy did n't need Robert , you see . I did . But she took him anyway . And that still hurts when I think of it , even now . " " Was their affair over ? " Lynley asked . Irene 's attention drifted from Havers ' pencil to the floor . " Yes . " The single word had the distinct flavour of a lie , and she continued at once , as if to hide this fact . " I even knew when it started between them . One of those dinner parties where people have too much to drink and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that she 'd never had a man who 'd been able to satisfy her in only one go . That , of course , was the sort of thing Robert would take as a personal challenge that had to be attended to without delay . Sometimes what hurts me the most is the fact thatp130Joy did n't love Robert . She never loved anyone at all after Alec Rintoul died . " " Rintoul 's been a recurring theme this evening . Were they ever engaged ? " " Informally . Alec 's death changed Joy . " " In what way ? " " How can I explain it ? " she replied . " It was like a fire , a rampage . It was as if Joy decided that she would start living with a vengeance once Alec was gone . But not to enjoy herself . Rather , to destroy herself . And to take as many of us down with her as she could . It was a sickness with her . She went through men , one after another , Inspector . She devoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever begin to make her forget Alec and she was daring each and every one of them to try . " Lynley walked to the bed , placed the contents from Joy 's shoulder bag onto the counterpane . Irene considered the objects listlessly . " Are these hers ? " she asked . He handed her Joy 's engagement calendar first . Irene seemed reluctant to take it , as if she would come across knowledge within it that she would rather not possess . However , she identified what notations she could : appointments with a publisher in Upper GrosvenorStreet , the birthday of Irene 's daughter Sally , Joy 's self-imposeddeadline for having three chapters of a book done . Lynley pointed out the name scrawled across one entire week . P. Green . " Someone new in her life ? " " Peter , Paul , Philip ? I do n't know , Inspector . She might have been going off on holiday with someone , but I could n't say . We did n't speak to one another very often . And then , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have told me about a new man in her life . But it would n't surprise me at all to know that she had one . That would have been more than typical of her . Really . " Disconsolately , Irene fingered one or two other items , the wallet , the matchbook , the chewing gum , the keys . She said nothing else . Watching her , Lynley pressed the button on the small tape recorder . Irene shrank infinitesimally at the sound of her sister 's voice . He let the machine play . Through the cheerful comments , through the vibrant excitement , through the future plans . He could n't help thinking , as he listened to Joy Sinclair once again , that she did n't sound at all like a woman bent upon destroying anyone . Halfway through it , Irene raised a hand to her eyes . She bent her head . " Does any of that mean anything to you ? " Lynley asked  | Irene shook her head blindly , a passionate movement , a second patent lie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , moving further into herself both physically and emotionally . Shrivelling up through a concerted act of will . " You ca n't bury her this way , Irene , " he said quietly . " I know that you want to . I understand why . But you know if you try it , she 'll haunt you forever . " He saw her fingers tighten against her skull . The nails caught at her flesh . " You do n't have to forgive her for what she 's done to you . But do n't put yourself into a position of doing something for which you can not forgive yourself . " " I ca n't help you . " Irene 's voice sounded distraught . " I 'm not sorry my sister 's dead . So how can I help you ? I ca n't help myself . " " You can help by telling me anything about this tape . " And ruthlessly , mercilessly , Lynley played it again , hating himself for doing so at the same time as he acknowledged it was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , at the end , there was no response from her . He rewound the tape , played it again . And then again . Joy 's voice was like a fourth person in the room . She coaxed . She laughed . She tormented . She pleaded . And she broke her sister the fifth time through the tape , on the words , " For God 's sake , do n't let Mum forget Sally again this year . " Irene snatched the recorder , shut it off with hands which fumbledon the buttons , and flung it back onto the bed as if touching it contaminated her . " The only reason my mother ever remembered my daughter 's birthday is because Joy reminded her , " she cried . Her face bore the signs of anguish , but her eyes were dry . " And still I hated her ! I hated my sister every minute and I wanted her to die ! But not like this ! Oh God , not like this ! Have you any idea what it 's like to want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it happen ? As if a mocking deity listened to your wishes and only granted the foulest ones you possess ? " Good God , the power of simple words . He knew . Of course , he knew . In the timely death of his own mother 's lover in Cornwall , in ways that Irene Sinclair could never hope to understand . " It sounds as if some of what she said was to be part of a new work . Do you recognise the place she 's describing ? The decaying vegetables , the sound of frogs and pumps , the flat land ? " " No . " " The circumstance of a winter storm ? " " No ! "  | " The man she mentions , John Darrow ? " Irene 's hair swung out in an arc as she turned her head away . At the sudden movement , Lynley said , " John Darrow . You recognise the name . " " Last night at dinner . Joy talked about him . She said something about wining and dining a dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's involved with ? " " No . No , I do n't think so . Someone  --  I think it was Lady Stinhurst  --  hadasked her about her new book . And John Darrow came up . Joy was laughing the way she always did , making light of the difficulties she 's been having with the writing , saying something about information she needed and was trying to get . It involved this John Darrow . So I think he 's connected with the book somehow . " " Book ? Another play , you mean ? " Irene 's face clouded . " Play ? No , you 've misunderstood , Inspector . Aside from an early play six years ago and the new piece for Lord Stinhurst , my sister did n't write for the theatre . She wrote books . She used to be a journalist , but then she took up documentary nonfiction . Her books are all about crimes . Real crimes . Murders , mostly . Did n't you know that ? " Murders mostly . Real crimes . Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that the missing piece to the triangular puzzle of motive-means-opportunity would be given to him so easily . But there it was , what he had been seeking , what he had known instinctively he would find . A motive for murder . Still obscure , but merely waiting for the details to flesh it out into a coherent explanation . And the connection was there on the tape as well , in Joy Sinclair 's very last words : " . . . ask Rhys how best to approach him . He 's good with people . " Lynley began replacing Joy 's belongings in the bag , feeling upliftedyet at the same time filled with a hard edge of anger at what had happened here last night , and at the price he was going to have to pay personally to see that justice was done . At the door , with Havers already out in the corridor , he was stopped by Irene Sinclair 's last words . She stood near the bed , backed by inoffensive wallpaper and surrounded by a suitable bedroom suite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw out no challenges , made no demands . She looked trapped within it . " Those matches , Inspector , " she said . " Joy did n't smoke . "  |p133MARGUERITE  RINTOUL , Countess of Stinhurst , switched out the bedroom light . The gesture was not born of a desire to sleep , since she knew very well that sleep would be an impossibility for her . Rather , it was a last vestige of feminine vanity . Darkness hid the tracery of lines that had begun to network and crumple her skin . In it , she felt protected , no longer the plump matron whose once beautiful breasts now hung pendulous inches short of her waist ; whose shiny brown hair was the product of weavings and dyes expertly orchestrated by the finest hairdresser in Knightsbridge ; whose manicured hands with their softly buffed nails bore the spotting of age and caressed absolutely nothing any longer . On the bedside table she placed her novel , laying it down so that its lurid cover lined up precisely with the delicate brass inlay etched against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title leered up at her . Savage Summer Passion . So pathetically obvious , she told herself . So useless as well . She looked across the room to where her husband sat in an armchair by the window , given over to the night , to the weak starlight that filtered through the clouds , to the amorphous shapes and shadows upon the snow . Lord Stinhurst was fully clothed , as was she , sitting upon the bed , her back against the headboard , a wool blanket thrown across her legs . She was less than ten feet away from him , yet they were separated by a chasm of twenty-five years of secrecy and suppression . It was time to bring it to an end . The thought of doing so was paralysing Lady Stinhurst . Every time she felt that the breath she was taking was the breath that would allow her to speak at last , her entire upbringing , her past , her social milieu rose in concert to strangle her . Nothing in her life had ever prepared her for a simple act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband now was to risk everything , to step into the unknown , to hazard coming up against the insurmountable wall of his decades of silence . Having tested these waters of communication periodically before , she knew how little might be gained from her efforts and how horribly her failure would sit upon her shoulders . Still , it was time . She swung her legs over the side of the bed . A momentary dizziness took her by surprise when she stood , but it passed quickly enough . She padded across to the window , acutely aware of the deep cold in the room and the nasty tightness in her stomach . Her mouth tasted sour . " Stuart . " Lord Stinhurst did not move . His wife chose her wordsp134carefully . " You must talk to Elizabeth . You must tell her everything . You must . " " According to Joy , she already knows . As did Alec . " As always , those last three words fell heavily between them , like blows against Lady Stinhurst 's heart . She could still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meeting the terrifyingend that was destined for Icarus . But burning , not melting , out of the sky . We are not meant to outlive our children , she thought . Not Alec , not now . She had loved her son , loved him instinctively and devotedly , but invoking his memory  --  like a raw wound in both of them that time had only caused to fester  --  had always been one of her husband 's ways of putting an end to unpleasant conversations . And it had always worked . But not tonight . " She knows about Geoffrey , yes . But she does n't know it all . You see , she heard the argument that night . Stuart , Elizabeth heard the fighting . " Lady Stinhurst stopped , seeking a response from him , seeking some kind of sign that would tell her it was safe to continue . He gave her nothing . She plunged on . " You spoke to Francesca this morning , did n't you ? Did she tell you about her talk with Elizabeth last night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I shall . Elizabeth saw you leave that night , Stuart . Alec and Joy saw you as well . They were all watching from a window upstairs . " Lady Stinhurst felt her voice wavering . But she forced herself to continue . " You know how children are . They see part , hear part , and assume the rest . Darling . Francesca said that Elizabethbelieves you killed Geoffrey . Apparently , she 's thought that .. . since the night it happened . " Stinhurst made no reply . Nothing changed about him , not the even flow of his breathing , not his upright posture , not his steady gaze on the frozen grounds of Westerbrae . His wife tentatively put her fingers on his shoulder . He flinched . She dropped her hand . " Please . Stuart . " Lady Stinhurst hated herself for the tremor behind her words , but she could n't stop them now . " You must tell her the truth . She 's had twenty-five years of believing you 're a murderer ! You ca n't let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Stinhurst did n't look at her . His voice was low . " No . " She could n't believe him . " You did n't kill your brother ! You were n't even responsible ! You did everything in your power  --  " " How can I destroy the only warm memories Elizabeth has ? She has so little , after all . For God 's sake , at least let her keep that . " " At the expense of her love for you ? No ! I wo n't have it . "  | " You will . " His voice was implacable , bearing the sort of unquestionableauthority that Lady Stinhurst had never once disobeyed . For to disobey was to step out of the role she had been playing her entire life : daughter , wife , mother . And nothing else . As far as she knew , there was only a void beyond the narrow boundaries set up by those who governed her life . Her husband spoke again . " Go to bed . You 're tired . You need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was told . IT WAS PAST TWO in the morning when Inspector Macaskin finally left , with a promise to telephone with the postmortems and the forensic reports as soon as he could . Barbara Havers saw him out and returned to Lynley and St. James in the sitting room . They were at the table , with the items from Joy Sinclair 's shoulder bag spread out before them . The tape recorder was playing yet another time , Joy 's voice rising and falling with the broken messages that Barbara had long ago memorised . Hearing it now , she realised that the recording had begun to take on the quality of a recurring nightmare , and Lynley the quality of a man obsessed . His were not quantum leaps of intuition in which the misty image of **28;16884;TOOLONG recognisable shape . Rather , they bore the appearance of contrivance , of an attempt to find and assess guilt where only by the wildest stretching of the imagination could it possibly exist . For the first time in that endless harrowing day , Barbara began to feel uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to realise that , for all his exterior gloss and sophistication , for all his trappings of upper-class splendour that she so mightily despised , Lynley was still the finest DI she had ever worked with . Yet Barbara knew intuitively that the case he was building now was wrong , founded on sand . She sat down and reached restlessly for the book of matches from Joy Sinclair 's bag , brooding upon it . It bore a curious imprint , merely three words , Wine 's the Plough , with the apostrophe an inverted pint glass spilling lager . Clever , Barbara thought , the sort of amusing memento one picks up , stuffs into a handbag , and forgets about . But she knew that it was only a matter of time before Lynley would grasp at the matchbook as another piece of evidence affirming Davies-Jones ' guilt . For Irene Sinclair had said that her sister did not smoke . And all of them had seen that Davies-Jones did . " We need physical evidence , Tommy , " St. James was saying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purest conjecture . Even Davies/Jones ' prints on the key can be explained away by the statement Helen gave us . " " I 'm aware of that , " Lynley replied . " But we 'll have the forensic report from Strathclyde CID . " " Not for several days , at least . " Lynley went on as if the other man had not spoken . " I 've no doubt that some piece of evidence will turn up . A hair , a fibre . You know as well as I how impossible it is to carry off a perfect crime . " " But even then , if Davies-Jones was in Joy 's room earlier in the day  --  and from Gowan 's report , he was  --  what have you gained by the presence of one of his hairs or a fibre from his coat ? Besides , you know as well as I that the crime scene was contaminated by the removal of the body , and there 's not a barrister in the country who wo n't know it as well . As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again . The evidence is going to be too weak . Only a motive can give it strength . " " That 's why I 'm going to Hampstead tomorrow . I 've a feeling that the pieces are lying there , ready to be put together in Joy Sinclair 's flat . " Barbara heard this statement with disbelief . It was beyond considerationthat they should leave so soon . " What about Gowan , sir ? You 've forgotten what he tried to tell us . He said he did n't see someone . And the only person he told me he saw last night was Rhys Davies-Jones . Do n't you think that means he was trying to change his statement ? " " He did n't finish the sentence , Havers , " Lynley replied . " He said two words , did n't see . Did n't see whom ? Did n't see what ? DaviesJones ? The cognac he was supposed to be carrying ? He expected to see him with something in his hand because he came out of the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only thought that 's what he saw ? What if he realised later that what he saw was something quite different , a murder weapon ? " " Or what if he did n't see Davies-Jones at all and that 's what he was trying to tell us ? What if he only saw someone else attempting to look like Davies-Jones , perhaps wearing his overcoat ? It could have been anyone . " Lynley stood abruptly . " Why are you so determined to prove the man is innocent ? " From his sharp tone , Barbara knew what direction his thoughts were taking . But he was n't the only one with a gauntlet to throw down . " Why are you so determined to prove that he 's guilty ? " Lynley gathered Joy 's belongings . " I 'm looking for guilt , Havers.  |p137It  's my job . And I believe the guilt lies in Hampstead . Be ready by half past eight . " He started for the door . Barbara 's eyes begged St. James to intercede in an area where she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the logic and rules that govern a police investigation . " Are you certain it 's wise to go back to London tomorrow ? " St. James asked slowly . " When you think of the inquest  --  " Lynley turned in the doorway , his face caught by the cavern of shadows in the hall . " Havers and I ca n't give professional evidence here in Scotland . Macaskin will handle it . As for the rest of them , we 'll collect their addresses . They 're not about to leave the country when their livelihood 's tied up on the London stage . " With that , he was gone . Barbara struggled to find her voice . " I think Webberly 's going to have his head over this . Ca n't you stop him ? " " I can only try to reason with him , Barbara . But Tommy 's no fool . His instincts are sound . If he feels he 's onto something , we can only wait to see what he finds . " In spite of St. James ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webberly sack him for this ? " " I suppose it depends on how it all turns out . " Something in his guarded statement told her everything she wanted to know . " You think he 's wrong , do n't you ? You think it 's Lord Stinhurst , too . God in heaven , what 's wrong with him ? What 's happened to him , Simon ? " St. James picked up the bottle of whisky . " Helen , " he said simply . THE KEY in his hand , Lynley hesitated at Lady Helen 's door . It was half past two . No doubt she would be asleep by now , his intrusion both disruptive and unwelcome . But he needed to see her . And he did n't lie to himself about the purpose of this visit . It had nothing to do with police work . He knocked once , unlocked the door and went in . Lady Helen was on her feet , coming across the room , but she halted when she saw him . He closed the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and striving to understand what they might imply . Her bed was undisturbed , its yellow and white counterpane pulled up round the pillows . Her shoes , slim black pumps , were onp138the floor next to it . They were the only article of clothing that she had removed other than her jewellery : gold earrings , a thin chain , a delicate bracelet on the nightstand . This last object caught his eyes , and for a painful moment he considered how small her wrists were that such a piece could encircle them so easily . There was nothing else to see in the room , save a wardrobe , two chairs , and a dressing table in whose mirror they both were reflected , warily confronting one another like two mortal enemies come upon each other unexpectedlyand without sufficient energy or will to do battle again . Lynley walked past her to the window . The west wing of the house stretched into the darkness , scattered lights making bright slits against black where curtains were not fully drawn , where others waited , like Helen , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing ? " Her voice was chary . " It 's far too cold in here , Helen . " He touched the radiator , felt its ineffective tingle of warmth , and went to the door to speak to the young constable stationed at the top of the stairs . " Would you see if there 's an electric fire somewhere ? " Lynley asked him . When the man nodded , he shut the door again and faced her . The distance between them seemed enormous . Hostility thickened the air . " Why have you locked me in here , Tommy ? Do you expect me to hurt someone ? " " Of course not . Everyone 's locked in . It 'll be over in the morn-ing . " There was a book on the floor next to one of the chairs . Lynley picked it up . It was a murder mystery , he saw , well thumbed through with typical , whimsical Helen-notations in the margins : arrows and exclamation points , underlinings and comments . She was always determined that no author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could solve any literary conundrum far sooner in its pages than could he . Because of this , he 'd been the recipient of her discarded , dog-eared books for the better part of a decade . Read this , Tommy darling . You shall never sort it out . At the memory 's sudden force , he felt stricken with sorrow , desolate , utterly alone . And what he had come to say would only serve to make the situation worse between them . But he knew he had to speak to her , whatever the cost . " Helen , I ca n't bear to see you do this to yourself . You 're trying to replay St. James to a different ending . I do n't want you to do it . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . None of this has anything to do with Simon . " Lady Helen remained where she was ,  |p139across  the room from him , as if to step in his direction were to surrender in some way . And she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruise low on her neck where the collar of her teal blouse dipped towards the swell of her breasts . But when she moved her head , the bruise disappeared , a trick of light , a product of unhappy imagination . " It does , " he said . " Or have n't you noticed yet how very much like St. James he is ? Even his alcoholism is St. James all over again with a simple difference in disability . Except that this time , you wo n't walk out on him , will you ? You wo n't go gratefully when he tries to send you away . " Lady Helen 's head turned from him . Her lips parted , then closed . He saw that she would allow him these moments of castigation , but she would offer no defence . His punishment would be never to know , never to understand completely what had drawn her to the Welshman , to be forced into guesswork that she would never affirm . He accepted this knowledge with rising anguish . Still , he wanted to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her warmth . " I know you , Helen . And I understand how guilt feeds on itself . Who on earth could possibly understand that better than I ? I crippledSt . James . But you 've always believed that your sin was worse , have n't you ? Because inside , where you would never have to admit it , you were relieved all those years ago when he broke your engagement . Because then you would never have to face life with a man who could no longer do all those things that , at the time , seemed so absurdly important . Skiing , bathing at resorts , dancing , hiking , having a wonderful time . " " Damn you . " Her voice was no more than a whisper . When she met his eyes , her face was white . It was a warning . He ignored it , compelled to go on . " For ten years you 've had yourself on the rack over leaving St. James . And now you see an opportunity to put it all right , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Switzerland to convalesce alone , for letting yourself be driven off when he needed you ; for shirking a marriage that appeared to have responsibilities far outweighingits pleasures . Davies-Jones is going to be your redemption , is n't he ? You plan to make him whole again , just as you could have done  --  and did n't do  --  for St. James . And then you 'll be able to forgive yourself at last . That 's it , is n't it ? That 's how it 's to be played . " " I think you 've said enough , " she said stiffly.  | " I have n't . " Lynley sought the words to break through to her ; it was imperative that she understand . " Because he is n't like St. James at all beneath the surface . Please . Listen to me , Helen . Davies-Jones is n't a man you 've known intimately , inside and out , since your eighteenth birthday . He 's a relative stranger to you , someone you ca n't really know . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you will . " She flinched from the easiness of his admission , but her slender body drew strength from the passion of her reply . Muscles became tense across her face and neck , even  --  to his imagination  --  beneath the soft sleeves of her blouse . " With me too blinded by love or remorse or guilt or whatever it is that prevents me from seeing what 's so patently obvious to you ? " She flung her hand sharply towards the doorway , to the house beyond it , to the room she had occupied and what had happened within it . " Exactly when did he set this murder in motion ? He left the house after the read-through . He did n't get back till one . " " On his own report , yes . " " You 're saying he lied to me , Tommy . But I know he did n't . I know he walks when he needs to drink . He told me that in London . I even walked with him out by the loch after he broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And do n't you see how clever that was , how all of that was to set you up to believe him when he said he 'd been out walking again last night ? He needed your compassion , Helen , if you were to allow him to stay in your room . And what better way to get it than to say he 'd been out walking off his need to drink . He could hardly have gained your sympathy so effectively by hanging about after the readthrough , could he ? " " Do you actually want me to believe that Rhys murdered his cousin while I was asleep , that he then came back into my room , and made love to me for a second time ? It 's completely absurd . " " Why ? " " Because I know him . " " You 've been to bed with him , Helen . I think you 'll agree that knowing a man is more complicated than falling into bed with him for a few steamy hours , no matter how pleasant they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wound made by his words . When she spoke again , it was with heavy irony . " You choose your words well . Congratulations . They do hurt . "  |p141Lynley  felt his heart twist . " I do n't want you to be hurt ! God in heaven , ca n't you see that ? Ca n't you see that I 'm trying to keep you from harm ? I 'm sorry about what 's happened . I 'm sorry for the foul way I treated ' you earlier . But none of that goes any distance to change the facts of last night . Davies-Jones used you to gain access to her , Helen . He used you again after he saw to Gowan this evening . He plans to go on using you unless I can stop him . And I intend to stop him . Whether you help me or not . " She lifted her hand to her throat , clutched at the collar of her blouse . " Help you ? My God , I think I 'd rather die . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blow . He might have answered but was spared the necessity by the police constable who had managed to find a single-bar electric fire to keep her warm through what remained of the night.  |p143BARBARA  HAVERS paused on the wide drive before going back into the house . Snow had fallen again during the night , but it was a light fall , insufficient to close roads but enough to make walking on the estate grounds wet , cold , and unpleasant . Nonetheless , after a foully sleepless night , she had risen shortly after dawn and had set out through the snow , determined to rid herself of the turmoil of mixed loyalties that were plaguing her . Logic told Barbara that her primary responsibility was to New Scotland Yard . Adherence right now to procedures , to judges ' rules , to Force regulations would add to the likelihood of her receiving a promotion the next time an inspector 's position came open . After all , she had taken the examination only last month  --  she could swear for certain that she 'd passed it this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre had earned her the highest possible marks . So the time was right for advancement , or as nearly right as it was ever going to be , if she only played this entire affair wisely . Thomas Lynley was what made everything so difficult . Barbara had spent practically every working hour over the last fifteen months in Lynley 's presence , so she was not at all oblivious of the qualities that had made him a superb member of the Force , a man who had risen from constable to sergeant to detective inspector in his first five years . He was quick-witted and intuitive , gifted with both compassion and humour , a man liked by his colleagues and well trusted by Superintendent Webberly . Barbara knew how lucky she was to be working with Lynley , knew how deserving he was ofp144her absolute faith . He put up with her moods , stoically listened to her ravings even when her most virulent attacks were directed against him , still encouraged her to think freely , to offer her own opinions , to disagree openly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she owed him personal debts that went far beyond her having been returned to CID from her demotion to uniformed patrol fifteen months back . So now she had to decide where her true loyalties lay , to Lynley or to advancement in her career . For in her forced hike through the woods this morning , she had inadvertently come upon a piece of information that bore the unmistakable stamp of being part of the puzzle . And she had to decide what to do with it . More , no matter what she decided , she had to understand exactly what it meant . The air was stinging in its icy purity . Barbara felt its sharp stab in her nose and throat , in her ears and against her eyes . Yet she breathed it in deeply five or six times , squinting against the brilliant purity of sunlit snow , before she trudged across the drive , stamped her feet roughly against the stone steps , and walked into the great hall of Westerbrae . It was nearly eight . There was movement in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys turning in locks upstairs . A smell of bacon and the rich perfume of coffee gave normality to the morning  --  as if the events of the past thirty-two hours had only been part of an extended nightmare  --  and the low murmur of pleasantvoices came from the drawing room . Barbara walked in to find Lady Helen and St. James sitting in a soft pool of sunlight at the east end of the room , sharing coffee and conversation . They were alone . As Barbara watched them together , St. James shook his head , reached out and rested his hand for a moment upon Lady Helen 's shoulder . It was a gesture of infinite gentleness , of understanding , the wordless binding of a friendship that made the two of them together stronger and more viable than either one could ever be alone . Seeing them , Barbara was struck by the thought of how easy it was to make a decision when she considered it in the light of friendship . Indeed , between Lynley and her career there was no choice at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to join them . Both looked as if they , too , had experienced a restless night . The lines on St. James ' face were more sharply defined than usual , and Lady Helen 's fine skin had a fragile look about it , like a gardenia that would bruise at the slightest touch . When St. James automati/tally began to rise in greeting , Barbara waved the social nicety to one side . " Can you come outside with me ? " she asked them . " I 've found something in the woods that I think you ought to see . " St. James ' face registered the impossibility of his being able to navigate the snow drifts , and Barbara hastily sought to reassure him . " There 's a brick walk for part of the way . And I 've flattened enough of a path in the forest itself , I think . It 's only about sixty yards into the trees . " " What it is ? " Lady Helen asked . " A grave , " Barbara replied . THE FOREST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled the great house . It was not the sort of woodland that would have sprung up naturally in this moor-filled area of Scotland . There were English and sessile oaks , beeches , walnuts , and sycamores mixed in with pines . A narrow path led through them , marked out by small circles of yellow paint that had been dotted onto the trunks of the trees . The forest was a place of that unearthly kind of silence that comes from the heavy insulation of snow upon tree branches and ground . No wind moved , and although the raw burst of an automobileengine pierced the stillness momentarily , it died off quickly , leaving in its wake only the restless lapping of water in the loch some twenty yards down the slope to their left . The going was not easy , for even though Sergeant Havers had indeed flattened a primitivepath through the woods , the snow was deep and the ground irregular , no place for a man who had difficulty enough on a surface that was flat and dry . It took fifteen minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Helen 's supportive arm , St. James was damp-faced from exertion when Havers finally led them off the main path onto a smaller branch that rose gently through a copse towards a knoll . During the summer , heavy foliage would probably have hidden both the knoll and the little track from the view of anyone on the main path from the house . But in the winter , hydrangeas that otherwise would have been vibrant with clusters of pink and blue flowers , and walnuts that would have created a verdant screen of protection , were bare , giving anyone free access to the plot of ground at the knoll 's top . It was an area about twenty-five feet square , bounded by an iron fence . White powder dusted this , hiding the fact that long ago the fence had surrendered to rust.  |p146Lady  Helen was the first to speak . " What on earth is a graveyard doing here ? Is there a church nearby ? " Havers indicated the direction the main path took towards the south . " There 's a locked chapel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old pier on the loch just below it . It looks like they 've boated their way to burials . " " Like the Vikings , " St. James said absently . " What have we here , Barbara ? " He pushed open the gate , wincing at the shriek of its unoiled metal . There was one set of footsteps in the snow already . " I had a look , " Havers explained . " I 'd already gone along to the family chapel and had a look there . So when I saw this on my way back , I was curious . See for yourself . Tell me what you think . " While Havers waited at the gate , St. James and Lady Helen crunched through the snow to the single gravestone that rose from it like a solitary grey augury , scratched by a bare elm branch that drooped heavily onto its top . It was not a terribly old stone , certainly not as old as those found in tumbling graveyards throughout the country . Yet it was very much abandoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving and St. James guessed that in midsummer , the yard itself would be wildly overgrown with cow parsley and weeds . Nonetheless , the words upon the stone were legible , only partially effaced by weather and neglect . Geoffrey Rintoul , Viscount Corleagh1914  --  1963Quietly , they studied the lonely grave . A dense chunk of snowfell from a branch above it and disintegrated on the stone . " Is that Lord Stinhurst 's older brother ? " Lady Helen asked . " It looks that way , " Havers replied . " Curious , would n't you say ? " " Why ? " St. James ' eyes swept across the plot , looking for othergraves . There were none . " Because the family home 's in Somerset , is n't it ? " Havers replied . " It is . " St. James knew that Havers was watching him , knew that she was attempting to gauge how much Lynley had told him of his private conversation with Lord Stinhurst . He tried to sound completelydetached . " So what 's Geoffrey doing buried here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he died here , " St. James replied . " You know as well as I that nobs like these bury their own in family plots , Simon . Why was n't this particular body taken home ?  |p147Or  , " she queried before he could answer , " if you 're going to say that it was n't possible for them to take the body home , then why was n't he buried in the Gerrard family plot just a few hundred yards further down the path ? " St. James chose his words with care . " Perhaps this was a favourite spot of his , Barbara . It 's peaceful , no doubt quite beautiful in the summer with the loch just below it . I ca n't think that it means all that much . " " Not even when you consider that this man , Geoffrey Rintoul , was Stinhurst 's older brother , and the rightful Lord Stinhurst in the first place ? " St. James ' eyebrows raised quizzically . " You 're not suggesting that Lord Stinhurst murdered his brother in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , would n't it make a lot more sense , if he wished to cover up a murder , to take his brother home and bury him with attendant pomp and circumstance in Somerset ? " Lady Helen had been listening to their exchange quietly , but she spoke at the mention of burials . " There 's something not quite right here , Simon . Francesca Gerrard 's husband  --  Phillip Gerrard  --  is n't buried in the family plot either . He 's on a small island in the loch , just a bit off shore . I saw the island from my window right after my arrival , and when I commented upon it to Mary Agnes  --  it has a curious tomb on it that looks like a folly  --  she told me all about it . According to Mary Agnes , that 's where Francesca 's husband , Phillip , insisted upon being buried . Insisted , Simon . It was in the terms of his will . I should guess it 's a bit of local colour because Gowan told me the exact same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . " " There you have it , " Havers put in . " Something awfully strange is going on with these two families . And you certainly ca n't argue that this is a Rintoul family graveyard here . Not without any other graves . Besides , the Rintouls are n't even Scots ! Why would they bury one of their family here unless  --  " " They had to , " Lady Helen murmured . " Or wanted to , " Havers finished triumphantly . She crossed the little yard and stood in front of St. James . " Inspector Lynley 's told you about his interrogation of Lord Stinhurst , has n't he ? He 's told you everything Stinhurst said . What 's going on ? " For a moment , St. James considered lying to Havers . He also considered telling her the brutal truth : that what Lynley had told him had been said in confidence and was none of her business . But he had a sense that she had not brought them out on this trek as anp148exercise in attempting to affix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rintoul , Lord Stinhurst . She could have done that easily enough by insisting that Lynley himself be the one to look at this solitary grave , by arguing its peculiarity with him . The fact that Havers had not done so suggested one of two things to St. James . Either she was collecting her own evidence in an attempt to aggrandiseherself and denigrate Lynley in front of their superiors at Scotland Yard , or she was seeking his own help to prevent Lynley from making a colossal mistake . Havers turned her back on him , walking away . " It 's all right . I ought not to have asked that . You 're his friend , Simon . Of course he 'd talk to you . " She pulled her woollen cap down roughly so that it covered her forehead and ears , looking cheerlessly down at the loch . Watching her , St. James decided that she deserved the truth . She deserved the tribute of someone 's trust and the opportunity to prove herself worthy of it . He told her Lord Stinhurst 's story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing nothing more than tugging at one or two dead weeds along the fence while St. James spun out the twisted tale of love and betrayal that had ended with Geoffrey Rintoul 's death . Her eyes , narrowed against the gleam of sunlight on the snow , rested on the tombstone nearby . When St. James was done , she asked only one question . " Do you believe it ? " " I ca n't think why a man in Lord Stinhurst 's position would defame his own wife to anyone . Even , " this as Havers was about to speak , " to save his own skin . " " Too noble for that ? " Her tone was cutting . " Not at all . Too proud . " " Then if , as you say , it 's a matter of pride , a matter of appearances , would n't he have kept up appearances one hundred percent ? " " What do you mean ? " Lady Helen spoke . " If Lord Stinhurst wanted to pretend that everything was status quo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial in Somerset in addition to keeping his marriage alive all these years ? As a matter of fact , it seems that taking his brother home would have been  --  in the long run  --  far less painful than staying married for the next thirty-six years to a woman who had made a fool of him with his own brother . " There was clear-eyed sense in that , typical of Helen . St. James had to admit it to himself even if he did n't say it aloud . But evidentlyp149he would not have to . For Sergeant Havers appeared to read it in his face . " Please . Help me get to the bottom of the Rintoul family , " she said desperately . " Simon , I swear that Stinhurst has something to bury . And I think Inspector Lynley 's been given the shovel to see to it himself . Perhaps by the Yard . I do n't know . " St. James hesitated , thinking about the difficulties he would be creating for himself  --  poised precariously between Lynley 's trust and Havers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help her . " It wo n't be easy . If Tommy finds out you 've gone your own way on this , Barbara , there 'll be hell to pay . Insubordination . " " You 'll be finished in CID , " Lady Helen added quietly . " You 'll be back on the street . " " Do n't you think I know that ? " Havers ' face , though pale , was resolute and unflinching . " And who 's going to be finished if there is a cover-up being generated ? And if it comes to light through the efforts of some reporter  --  someone like Jeremy Vinney , by God  --  sniffing it out on his own ? At least this way , if I 'm involved in looking into Stinhurst , the inspector 's protected . For all anyone will know , he 's ordered me to do it . " " You care for Tommy , do n't you ? " Havers looked away at once from Lady Helen 's sudden query . " Most of the time I hate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's given the sack , it 's not going to be over some berk like Stinhurst . " St. James smiled at the ferocity of her reply . " I 'll help you , " he said . " For what it 's worth . " ALTHOUGH the broad walnut sideboard bore a heavy burden of chafing dishes , all exuding a variety of breakfast odours from kippers to eggs , the dining room held only one occupant when Lynley entered . Elizabeth Rintoul 's back was to the door and , apparently indifferent to the sound of his footsteps , she did not turn her head to see who was joining her for the meal . Rather , she toyed a fork against the single sausage on her plate , rolling it back and forth , her eyes making a study of the shiny trail of grease it left , snail-like , in its wake . Lynley joined her , carrying a cup of black coffee and a single slice of cold toast . She was , he presumed , dressed for the journey back to London with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black skirt and grey jumper were overlarge , and although she wore black tights to match them , a small ladder in the ankle promised top150lengthen as the day drew on . Over the back of her chair was draped a curious full-length cape , midnight blue in colour , a sort of Sarah Woodruff garment that one might wear for striking dramatic poses on the Cobb . It certainly did n't seem to fit in with the general scheme of Elizabeth 's personality . That she was n't eager to spend any time with Lynley became evident the moment he sat down across from her . Stoney-faced , she pushed back her chair and began to rise . " I 've been given to understand that Joy Sinclair was engaged to your brother Alec at one time , " Lynley observed as if she 'd made no movement . Her eyes did n't shift from her plate . She settled back down and began cutting the sausage into wafer-thin slices , eating none of them . Her hands were extraordinarily large , even for a woman of her height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratches covered them , Lynley noted . Several days old . " Cats . " Elizabeth 's voice was a shade less than surly . Lynley chose not to reply to the evasive monosyllable , so she went on by saying , " You 're looking at my hands . The scratches are from my cats . They do n't much like it when one breaks up their copulating . But there are some activities that I frankly prefer not go on on my bed . " It was a double-edged remark , telling in its inadvertent admission . Lynley wondered what an analyst would make of it . " Did you want Joy to marry your brother ? " " It hardly matters now , does it ? Alec 's been dead for years . " " How did she come to meet him ? " " Joy and I were at school together . She came home with me for half-terms occasionally . Alec was there . " " And they got on ? " At this , Elizabeth raised her head . Lynley marvelled that a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like an inexpertly painted mask . " Joy got on with all men , Inspector . It was her special gift . My brother was just one of a long line of her suitors . " " Yet I 've the impression she took him far more seriously than the others . " " Of course . Why not ? Alec professed his love often enough to sound like a perfect sap at the same time as he massaged her ego . And how many of the others could offer her the promise of being Countess of Stinhurst once Daddy popped off ? " Elizabeth began arranging the pieces of her sausage into a pattern on her plate.  | " Did her relationship with your brother put a strain on your friendship ? " A breath of laughter shot through her nose like a gust of angry wind . " Our friendship was defined by Alec , Inspector . Once he died , I served no further purpose in Joy Sinclair 's life . I saw her only once after Alec 's memorial service , in fact . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . " " Yes . Until this weekend . That 's the kind of friends we were . " " Is it your habit to travel with your parents on a theatrical outing such as this ? " " Not at all . But I 'm fond of my aunt . It was a chance to see her . So I came . " An unpleasant smile played round Elizabeth 's mouth , quivered at her nostrils , and disappeared . " Of course , there was also Mummy 's plan for my lusty liaison with Jeremy Vinney . And I could n't disappoint her when she was depending so much upon this being the weekend that my rose was finally plucked , if that 's not too much of a metaphor for you . " Lynley ignored the implication . " Vinney 's known your family long , " he concluded . " Long ? He 's known Daddy forever , on both sides of the footlights . Years ago in the regionals , he fancied himself the next Olivier , but Daddy set him straight . So Vinney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since , happily getting his jollies by trashing as many productions in a year as he can . But this new play . . . well , it was something close to my father 's heart . The Agincourt re-opening and all . So I suppose my parents wanted me to be here to ensure good reviews . You know what I mean , just in case Vinney decided to respond to a . . . shall we say , less than delectable bribe ? " She swept a hand rudely down the length of her body . " Myself in exchange for a favourable commentary in The Times . It would meet the needs of both my parents , do n't you see ? My mother 's desire to have me properly serviced at last . My father 's desire to take London in triumph . " She had deliberately returned to her prior theme in spite of Lynley 's offer to turn the tide of conversation . Cooperatively , he took up her thought . " Is that why you went to Jeremy Vinney 's room the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Of course not ! Smarmy little man with fingers like hairy sausages . " She stabbed her fork at her plate . " As far as I was concerned , Joy could have the little beast . Ip152think he 's pathetic , rubbing up to theatre people in the hope that hanging about might give him the talent he lacked to make it on the stage years ago . Pathetic ! " The sudden burst of passion seemed to disconcert her . As if to negate it , she shifted her eyes and said , " Well , perhaps that 's why Mummy considered him such a suitable candidate for me . Two little blobs of pathos , drifting into the sunset together . God , what a romantic thought . " " But you went to his room  --  " " I was looking for Joy . Because of Aunt Francie and her bloody pearls . Although now I think about it , Mummy and Aunt Francie probably had the entire scene planned out in advance . Joy would rush off to her room , salivating over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt Mummy had already been in his room with flower petals and holy water , and all that was left was the act itself . What a pity . All that effort she went to , only to have it wasted on Joy . " " You seem fairly certain about what was going on between them in Vinney 's room . I do wonder about that . Did you see Joy ? Are you certain she was with him ? Are you sure it was n't somebody else ? " " I . . . " Elizabeth stopped . She toyed jerkily with knife and fork . " Of course it was Joy . I heard them , did n't I ? " " But you did n't see her ? " " I heard her voice ! " " Whispering ? Murmuring ? It was late . She 'd have kept it low , would n't she ? " " It was Joy ! Who else could it have been ? And what else would be going on between them after midnight , Inspector ? Poetry readings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , it was with only one thing on her mind . I know it . " " She did that with Alec when she visited at your home ? " Elizabeth 's mouth shut , tightened . She went back to her plate . " Tell me what you did when you left the read-through the othernight , " Lynley said . She moved the sliced sausage into a neat little triangle . Then with the knife , she began cutting the circular pieces in half . Each slice was sparely made and carried out with acute concentration . It was a moment before she replied . " I went to my aunt . She was upset . I wanted to help . " " You 're fond of her . " " You seem surprised , Inspector . As if it 's a miracle of sorts that I could be fond of anything . Is that right ? " In the face of-his refusal to rise to her taunting , she put down knife and fork , pushed her chairp153fully back , and regarded him straightforwardly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compress on her head . We talked . " " About ? " ' Elizabeth smiled one last time , but it was , inexplicably , a reactionthat seemed to mix both amusement and the knowledge of having bested an opponent . " The Wind in the Willows , if you really must know , " she said . " You 're familiar with the story , are n't you ? The toad . The badger . The rat . And the mole . " She stood , reached for her cape , and swung it round her shoulders . " Now if there 's nothing more , Inspector , I 've things to see to this morning . " That said , she left him . Lynley heard her bark of laughter echo in the hall . IRENE SINCLAIR had herself just heard the news when Robert Gabriel found her in what Francesca Gerrard optimistically labelled her games room . Behind the last door in the lower northeast corridor , almost obscured behind a pile of disused outdoor garments , the room was completely isolated , and once inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pervasive congestion of dust and grime . Obviously , the renovation of the house had not reached this far corner yet . Irene found herself glad of it . An old billiard table sat in the centre of the room , its baize covering loosely rippled , the netting under most of the pockets either torn or missing altogether . There were cue sticks on a rack on the wall , and Irene fingered these absently as she made her way to the window . No curtains covered it , a condition that contributed to the numbing want of heat . Since she wore no coat , she held her body tightly and rubbed her hands along her arms , pressing hard against the wool sleeves of her dress , feeling the answering friction like a kind of pain . From the window there was little to see , just a grove of winterbarealders beyond which the slate top of a boathouse seemed to be sprouting from a hillock like a triangular excrescence . It was an optical illusion , fabricated from the angle of the window and the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the continuing place that illusions seemed to be making in her life . " God in heaven , Renie . I 've been looking for you everywhere . What are you doing in here ? " Robert Gabriel crossed the room to her . He had come in noiselessly , managing to shut the warped door without a sound . He was carrying his overcoat and said in explana/tion of it , " I was just about to go outside and start a search . " He dropped the coat on her shoulders . It was a meaningless enough gesture , yet Irene still felt a distinct aversion to his touch . He was so near that she could smell the cologne he wore and the last vestige of coffee fighting with toothpasteupon his breath . It made her feel ill . If Gabriel noticed , he gave no sign . " They 're letting us leave . Have they made an arrest ? Do you know ? " She could n't bring herself to look at him . " No . No arrest . Not yet . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquest . God , what a dashed inconvenience it is to have to run back and forth from London . But at least it 's better than having to stay in this ice pit . The hot water 's entirely gone , you know . And little hope of having repairs done on that old boiler for at least three days . That 's taking roughing it to the limit , is n't it ? " " I heard you , " she said . Her voice was a whisper , small and despairing . She felt him looking at her . " Heard ? " " I heard you , Robert . I heard you with her the other night . " " Irene , what are you  --  " " Oh , you need n't worry that I 've told the police . I would n't do that , would I ? But that 's why you 've come looking for me , I dare say . To make sure my pride ensures my silence . " " No ! I do n't even know what you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back to London . I do n't want you to be going off on your own . There 's no telling  --  " " Here 's the most amusing part , " Irene interrupted acidly . " I 'd actually come looking for you . God help me , Robert , I think I was ready to have you back . I 'd even  --  " To her shame , her voice broke and she moved away from him as if by that she would regain her self-control . " I 'd even brought you a picture of our James . Did you know he was Mercutio at school this year ? I had two photographs made , one of James and one of you in a double frame . Remember that photo of you as Mercutio all those years ago ? Of course , you do n't look very much alike because James has my colouring , but all the same I thought you 'd want to have the pictures . Mostly because of James . No , I 'm lying to myself . And I swore last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the pictures because I hated you and I loved you and just for a moment the other night when you and I were together in the library , I thought there was a chance .... " " Renie , for the love of God  --  "  | " No ! I heard you ! It was Hampstead all over again ! Exactly ! And they say that life does n't repeat itself , do n't they ? What a filthy laugh ! All I needed to do was open the door to find you a second time having my sister . Just as I did last year , with the only difference being that I was alone this time . At least our children would have been spared a second go at the sight of their father sweating and panting and moaning over their lovely aunt Joy . " " It is n't  --  " " What I think ? " Irene felt her face quiver with encroaching tears . Their presence angered her  --  that he should still be able to reduce her to this . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever lies . No more , ' It only happened once . ' No more anything . " He grabbed her arm . " Do you think I killed your sister ? " His face looked ill , perhaps from lack of sleep , perhaps from guilt . She laughed hoarsely , shaking him off . " Killed her ? No , that 's not at all your style . Dead , Joy was absolutely no good to you , was she ? After all , you are n't the least bit interested in screwing a corpse . " " That did n't happen ! " " Then what did I hear ? " " I do n't know what you heard ! I do n't know who you heard ! Anyone could have been with her . " " In your room ? " she demanded . His eyes widened in panic . " In my ... Renie , good God , it 's not what you think ! " She flung his coat off her shoulders . Dust leaped from the floor when it dropped . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert . Because now I realise that I 've become one . God help me . I used to think that if Joy died I 'd be free of the pain . Now I believe I 'll only be free of it when you 're dead as well . " " How can you say that ? Is that what you really want ? " She smiled bitterly . " With all my heart . God , God ! With all my heart ! " He stepped away from her , away from the coat on the floor between them . His face was ashen . " So be it , love , " he whispered . LYNLEY FOUND Jeremy Vinney outside on the drive , stowing his suitcase into the boot of a hired Morris . Vinney was muffled against the cold in coat , gloves , and scarf ; his breath steamed the air . His high domed forehead gleamed pinkly where the sun struck it and he looked , surprisingly , as if he were perspiring . He was also , Lynleyp156noted , the first to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the drive to him , his footsteps grating against the gravel and ice . Vinney looked up . " Making an early start of it , " Lynley remarked . The journalist nodded towards the house where dark early morningshadows were painted like ink along the stone walls . " Not really a spot for lingering , is it ? " He slammed the boot lid home and checked to see that it was securely locked . Fumbling a bit with his keys , he dropped them and cleared his throat raspily as he bent to retrieve them in their worn leather case . When he finally looked at Lynley , it was to reveal a face upon which grief played subtly , the way it often does when an initial shock has been lived through and the immensity of a loss begins to be measured against the endlessnessof time . " Somehow , " Lynley said , " I should think a journalist would be the last to leave . " At this , Vinney gave an abrupt , little laugh . It seemed selfdirected , punitive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crime ? Looking for a good ten inches of space on page one ? Not to mention a byline and a knighthood for having solved the crime single-handedly ? Is that how you see it , Inspector ? " Lynley answered the question by asking one . " Why were you actually here this weekend , Mr. Vinney ? Every other presence can be accounted for in one way or another . But you remain a bit of a mystery . Can you shed some light on it for me ? " " Did n't you get a good enough picture from our attractive Elizabethlast evening ? I was wild to get Joy in bed . Or better yet , I was picking her brains for material to bolster my career . Choose either one . " Frankly , I 'd prefer the reality . " Vinney swallowed . He seemed discomfited , as if he expected something other than equanimity from the police . Bellicose insistenceupon the truth , perhaps , or a finger stabbed provocatively into his chest . " She was my friend , Inspector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . And now she 's gone . " His eyes looked burnt out as he turned them towards the untroubled surface of the loch in the distance . " But people do n't understand that kind of friendship between a man and a woman , do they ? They want to make something of it . They want to cheapen it up . " Lynley was not untouched by the man 's distress . He noticed , however , that Vinney had sidestepped his question . " Was Joy the one who actually arranged for you to be here ? I know you did thep157phoning to Stinhurst , but did she smooth the way ? Was it her idea ? " When Vinney nodded , he asked , " Why ? " " She said she was worried about how Stinhurst and the actors would receive the revisions she 'd made to the play . She wanted a friend along , she said , for moral support should things not go her way . I 'd been following the Agincourt renovation for months . It seemed reasonable that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its opening . So I came . To support her , as she asked . But I did n't support her at all in the end , did I ? She may as well have been here alone . " " I saw your name in her engagement book . " " I should n't be surprised . We met for lunch regularly . We 've done so for years . " " At these meetings , did she tell you anything about this weekend ? What it would be like ? What to expect ? " " Just that it was a read-through and that I might find it an interesting story . " " The play itself ? " Vinney did n't answer at first . His vision appeared fixed on nothing . When he replied , however , his voice sounded thoughtful , as if he 'd been struck by an idea unconsidered before . " Joy said she wanted me to think about writing an early article on the play . It would be a piece about the stars , the plot , perhaps the format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea about how the play would be staged . But I . . . I could easily have got that information in London , could n't I ? We see . . . saw . . . each other often enough . So could she . . . could she have been worried that something like this might happen to her , Inspector ? Good God , could she have hoped I 'd see to it that the truth were told ? " Lynley commented upon neither the man 's apparent belief in the inability of the police to ferret out the truth nor the egotistical likelihood of a single journalist 's being able to do it for them . Nonetheless , he catalogued the fact that Vinney 's remark was astonishinglyclose to Lord Stinhurst 's own assessment of the columnist 's presence . " Are you saying she was concerned about her safety ? " " She did n't say that , " Vinney admitted honestly . " And she did n't act concerned . " " Why was she in your room the other night ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had it out with Stinhurst and went to her room . But she felt restless , so she came to mine . ' lip talk . "  | " What time was this ? " " A bit after midnight . Perhaps a quarter past . " " What did she talk about ? " " The play at first . How she was bound and determined to see to it that it was produced , with or without Stinhurst . And then about Alec Rintoul . And Robert Gabriel . And Irene . She felt rotten about everything that had happened to Irene , you know . She . . . she was desperate for her sister to get back with Gabriel . That 's why she wanted Irene in the play . She thought if the two of them were thrown together enough , nature would take its course . She said she wanted Irene 's forgiveness and knew she could n't have it . But more than that , I think she wanted to forgive herself . And she could n't do that as long as Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glib enough recital , seemingly straightforward . Yet Lynley'sinstincts told him there was more to be said about Joy 's nocturnal visit to Vinney 's room . " You make her sound rather saintly . " Vinney shook his head in denial . " She was n't a saint . But she was a decent friend . " " What time did Elizabeth Rintoul come to your room with the necklace ? " Vinney brushed the snow from the Morris ' roof before answering . " Not long after Joy came in . I . . . Joy did n't want to talk to her . She expected it would be another row about the play . So I kept Elizabeth out . I only opened the door a crack ; she could n't see inside . So when I would n't invite her in , of course she assumed Joy was in my bed . That 's fairly typical of her . Elizabeth ca n't conceive that members of the opposite sex might just be friends . With her , a conversation with a man is an access route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . " " When did Joy leave your room ? " " Shortly before one . " " Did anyone see her leave ? " " There was no one about . I do n't think anyone saw her , unless Elizabeth was peering out her door somehow . Or maybe Gabriel . My room was between both of theirs . " " Did you see Joy to her room ? " " No . Why ? " " Then she might not have gone there at once . If , as you said , she thought she would n't be able to sleep . " " Where else would she go ? " Understanding swept across his face.  | " To meet someone ? No . She was n't interested in any of these people . " " If , as you say , Joy Sinclair was merely your friend , how can you be certain that she did n't share something more than friendship with someone else ? With one of the other men here this weekend . Or one of the women , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He blinked and looked away . " There were no lies between us , Inspector . She knew everything . I knew everything . Surely she would have told me if ... " He stopped , sighing , rubbing the back of his gloved hand wearily across his forehead . " May I be off ? What else is there to say ? Joy was my friend . And now she 's dead . " Vinney spoke as if there were a connection between the last two ideas . Lynley could n't help wondering if there was . Curious about the man and his relationship with Joy Sinclair , he chose another subject . " What can you tell me about a man called John Darrow ? " Vinney dropped his hand . " Darrow ? " he repeated blankly . " Nothing . Should I know who he is ? " " Joy did . Evidently . Irene said she even mentioned him at dinner , perhaps in reference to her new book . What can you tell me about it ? " Lynley watched Vinney 's face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Joy had ostensibly shared everything . " Nothing . " He appeared embarrassed about this apparent contradiction in what he had previously said . " She did n't talk about her work . There was nothing . " " I see . " Lynley nodded thoughtfully . The other man shifted his weight back and forth on his feet . He played his keys from one hand to the other . " Joy carried a tape recorder in her shoulder bag . Did you know ? " " She used it whenever a thought struck her . I knew that . " " She made reference to you on it , asking herself why she was in such a lather over you . Why might she have said that ? " " In a lather over me ? " His voice rose incredulously . " ' Jeremy . Jeremy . Oh Lord , why be in such a lather over him ? It 's hardly a lifetime proposition . ' Those were her words . Can you shed light on them ? " Vinney 's face was tranquil enough , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't . I ca n't think what she meant . We did n't have that sort of friendship . At least not on my side . Not at all . " Six denials . Lynley knew his man well enough to discern the fact that his last remarks had deliberately misdirected the conversation.  |p160Vinney  was n't a good liar . But he was skilled in seizing the moment and using it cleverly . He 'd just done so . But why ? " I wo n't keep you any longer , Mr. Vinney , " Lynley concluded . " No doubt you 're anxious to get back to London . " Vinney looked as if he wanted to say more , but instead he got into the Morris and switched on its ignition . At first the car made that rolling sound that comes from an engine unwilling to start . But then it coughed and fired into life , releasing exhaust fumes dyspeptically . Vinney cranked down the window while the front wipers worked to free the windscreen of snow . " She was my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed the car . The tyres spun fiercely on a patch of ice before gaining hold on the gravel . He shot down the drive towards the road . Lynley watched Vinney 's departure , intrigued by the man 's compulsion to repeat that last remark , as if it contained an underlying meaning that a detective 's close scrutiny would instantly reveal . For some reason  --  perhaps because of the distant presence of Inverness  --  ittook him back to Eton and a fifth form 's passionate debate over the obsessions and compulsions evidenced by Macbeth , that pricking of conscience spurring his tormented references to sleep once the deed was done . What need is going unfulfilled in the man despite his successful completion of the act that he thought would bring him joy ? His pacing literature master would ask the question insistently , pointing at this boy or that for assessments , evaluations , speculations , defence . Needs drive compulsions . What need ? What need ? It was a very good question , Lynley decided . He felt for his cigarette case and started back across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the corner of the house . Snow clung to their trouser legs as if they 'd been thrashing in it . Lady Helen was right behind them . For an awkward moment , the four of them stared at one another wordlessly . Then Lynley said , " Havers , put a call in to the Yard , will you ? Let Webberly know we 're on our way back to London this morning . " Havers nodded , disappearing through the front door . With a quick glance from Lady Helen to Lynley , St. James did likewise . " Will you come back with us , Helen ? " Lynley asked when they were alone . He put his cigarette case back into his pocket , unopened . " It 'll be a quicker trip for you . We 've a helicopter waiting near Oban . " " I ca n't , Tommy . You know that . " Her words were not unkind . But they were unmercifully final.  |p161There  seemed to be nothing more for them to say to each other . Still , Lynley found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how shadowy or inconsequential . It was inconceivablethat he should part from her this way . And that 's what he told her , before common sense or pride or stiff propriety could prevent him from doing so . " I ca n't bear your going away from me like this , Helen . " She was caught before him in a streak of sunlight . It slanted through her hair , turning it the colour of a fine , old brandy . Just for a moment her lovely dark eyes held an unreadable emotion . Then it vanished . " I must go , " she said quietly , passed by him and entered the house . It 's like a death , Lynley thought . But without a proper burial , without a period of mourning , without an end to lamentation . IN HIS CLUTTERED London office , Superintendent Malcolm Webberlyplaced the telephone receiver back into its cradle . " That was Havers , " he said . In a characteristic gesture , he raked his right hand through his thinning , sandy hair and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baldness . Sir David Hillier , Chief Superintendent , did not move from the window where he had been standing for the last quarter hour , his eyes placidly evaluating the serried collection of buildings that composed the city skyline . As always , he was impeccably dressed , and his posture suggested a man at ease with success , comfortable with navigating the treacherous straits of political power . " And ? " he asked . " They 're on their way back . " " That 's all ? " " No . According to Havers , they 're tracking a lead to Hampstead . Apparently , Sinclair was working on a book there . At her home . " Hillier 's head turned slowly but with the sun behind him , his face was in shadow . " A book ? In addition to the play ? " " Havers was n't all too clear about it . However , I got the impressionit was something that struck Lynley , something that he feels he must follow through . " Hillier smiled coolly at this . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's my best man , David , " Webberly said bitterly . " And he 'll follow orders , of course . As will you . " Hillier turned hack to his contemplation of the city.  |p163IT  WAS HALF past two when Lynley and Havers finallyreached Joy Sinclair 's small corner house . Located in the fashionable Hampstead area of London , the white brick buildingwas a testament to the author 's success . Its front window , hung with diaphanous ivory curtains , bowed out over a patch of garden where pruned rose bushes , dormant star jasmine , and tight-budded camellias grew . Two window boxes spilled ivy down the front and up the walls of the house , particularly near the doorway whose narrow shingled pediment was nearly lost beneath lush , bronzeveinedleaves . Although the house faced Flask Walk , its garden entry was on Back Lane , a narrow cobbled avenue that climbed towards Heath Street a block away , where traffic moved smoothly , almost without sound . Followed by Havers , Lynley unhooked the wrought iron gate and crossed the flagstone pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a watery winter sunshine caught upon the brass lighting fixture to the left of the door and upon the polished post slot at its centre . " Not bad digs , " Havers commented with grudging admiration . " Your basic bricked-in garden , your basic nineteenth-century lamp post , your basic tree-shaded street lined with your very basic BMWs . " She jerked a thumb at the house . " Must have set her back a few quid . " " From what Davies-Jones said about the terms of her will , I'vep164the impression she could afford it , " Lynley replied . He unlocked the door and motioned Havers inside . They found themselves in a small anteroom , marble-tiled and unfurnished . A collection of several days ' letters lay scattered on the floor , pushed through the slot in the door by the postman . They were the kind of collection one might expect in the post of a successful author : five circulars , an electricity account , eleven lettersaddressed to Joy in care of her publisher and forwarded on , a telephone account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several business-size envelopes with a variety of return addresses . Lynley handed them to Havers . " Have a look through these , Sergeant . " She took them and they went on into the house , through an opaque glass door that led into a long hall . Here , two doors opened along the left wall and a staircase rose along the right . At the far end of the corridor , afternoon shadows filled what appeared to be the kitchen . Lynley and Havers entered the sitting room first . The room shone in a filtered gold light that fell in three oblique shafts through a large bay window across a carpet the colour of mushrooms which had the look and smell of having been newly laid . But there was very little else to reveal the personality of the house 's owner , other than low-slung chairs grouped round calf-high tables that spoke of a penchant for modern design . This was affirmed by Joy Sinclair 's choice of art . Three oils after the fashion of Jackson Pollock leaned against one wall , waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angular marble sculpture stood , its subject indeterminate . Double doors on the eastern wall opened into the dining room . It too was furnished sparingly , with that same taste for the sleek paucity of modern design . Lynley walked to the set of four French doors behind the dining table , frowning at the simplicity of their locks and the ease of entry they would afford the least skilled burglar . Not , he admitted to himself , that Joy Sinclair had much here worth stealing , unless the market for Scandinavian furniture was booming or the paintings in the sitting room were the real thing . Sergeant Havers pulled out one of the dining chairs and sat down at the table , spreading the mail in front of her , pursing her lips thoughtfully . She began slitting it open . " Popular lady . Must be a dozen different invitations in here . " " Hmm . " Lynley looked out at the brick-walled back garden , a square not much larger than the area required to hold one thin ashp165tree , a circlet of ground beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by a thin layer of snow . He went on into the kitchen . The pervasive feeling of anonymous ownership here was much the same as in the other two rooms . Black-fronted appliances broke into a long row of white cabinets , a scrubbed pine breakfast table with two chairs stood against one wall , and bright splashes of primary colour had strategic places throughout the room : a red cushion here , a blue tea kettle there , a yellow apron on a hook behind the door . Lynley leaned against the counter and studied it all . Houses always had a way of revealing their owners to him , but this house had a look of deliberate artificiality , something created by an interior designer who had been given free rein by a woman absolutely uninterested in her personal environment . The result was a tasteful showpiece of restrained success . But it told him nothing . " Horrendous telephone bill , " Havers called from the dining room . " Looks like she spent most of her time chatting it up with half a dozen chums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a print out of her calls . " " Such as ? " " Seven calls to New York , four to Somerset , six to Wales and .. . let me see . . . ten to Suffolk . All very brief save for two longer ones . " " Made at the same time of day ? Made one after another ? " " No , over five days . Last month . Interspersed with the calls toWales . " " Check on all the numbers . " Lynley started down the hall towards the stairs as Havers slit open another envelope . " Here 's something , sir . " She read out to him , " ' Joy , You 've answered none of my calls nor any of my letters . I shall expect to hear from you by Friday or the matter will have to be turned over to our legal department . Edna . ' " Lynley paused , his foot on the first step . " Her publisher ? " " Her editor . And it 's on publishing house stationery . Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earlier information : the reference on the tape recording to putting Edna off , the crossed-out appointments on Upper Grosvenor Street in Joy 's engagement calendar . " Telephone the publishing house , Sergeant . Find out what you can . Then do the same for the rest of the long-distance calls on the print out . I 'm going up above . " While Joy Sinclair 's personality had seemed absent on the lower floor of the house , her presence asserted itself with chaotic abandonp166once Lynley reached the top of the stairs . Here was the life centre of the building , an eclectic jumble of personal possessions collected and treasured . Here , Joy Sinclair was everywhere , in the photographs covering the walls of the narrow hall , in an overfull storage cabinet stuffed with everything from linens to crusty paintbrushes , in the curtain of lingerie in the bathroom , even in the air , which held the faint fragrance of bath powder and perfume . Lynley went into the bedroom . It was a riot of multicoloured pillows , battered rattan furniture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a photograph that he examined briefly . An arrow-thin , sensitive-looking young man stood by the fountain in the Great Court of Trinity College , Cambridge . Lynley noted the way his hair grew back from his forehead , recognised something familiar in the set of his shoulders and head . Alec Rintoul , he guessed , and replaced it . He went on to the front of the house . Here , Joy 's study was no different from the other rooms , and upon his first look at it , Lynley wondered how anyone could manage to produce a book in an atmosphere so totally devoid of order . He stepped over a pile of manuscripts near the door and walked to the wall where two maps were hung above a word processor . The first map was large , a regulation district map of the sort bookstores sell to tourists who want to make a thorough scrutiny of a particular area of the country . This one was for Suffolk , although parts of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk were included on it . Evidently , Joy had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the name of a village was circled heavily in red ink , and some two inches from it a large X had been drawn not far from Mildenhall Fen . Lynley put on his spectacles to get a better look . Porthill Green , he read beneath the red circle . And then , a moment later , he made the connection . P. Green in Joy 's engagement diary . Not a person at all , but a place . Further circles appeared here and there on the map : Cambridge , Norwich , Ipswich , Bury St. Edmunds . Routes were traced out from each of these to Porthill Green and from Porthill Green out to the X near Mildenhall Fen . Lynley considered the implications attached to the presence of the map as below him he heard Sergeant Havers making one telephone call after another , muttering to herself occasionallywhen a response displeased her or when she was kept waiting or a line was engaged . Lynley dropped his eyes to the second map on the wall . This was hand-drawn and rough , a pencilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . They were only identifiedp167in the most generic of terms as church , greengrocers , pub , cottage , petrol station . The map told him nothing . Unless , of course , it was a rough delineation of Porthill Green . And even then it only indicatedJoy 's interest in the spot . Not why she was interested , or what she would have done had she gone there . Lynley gave his attention to her desk . Like everything else in the room , it had the appearance of disordered confusion , of the sort in which the originator of the mess knows exactly where everything is but of which no other human being could ever make sense . Books , maps , notebooks , and papers covered its surface , as well as an unwashed teacup , several pens , a stapler , and a tube of heat-producinganalgesic to be rubbed on tired muscles . He considered it for several minutes as Havers ' voice continued its rise and fall of conversation below him . There had to be some strange system involved , Lynley thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before he understood what it was . Although the piles of material made no superficial sense as a whole , taken individually , they were perfectly rational . One stack of books seemed to be reference materials . There were three psychology texts dealing with depression and suicide , two textbooks on the workings of the British police . Another stack was a collection of newspaper articles , all detailing one sort of death or another . A third stack contained a collection of booklets and pamphletsdescribing various sections of the country . A last stack was correspondence , thick and probably gone unanswered . He looked through this , ignoring the fan letters , working on instinct , hoping it would guide him to something significant . He found it thirteen letters into the stack . It was a brief note from Joy Sinclair 's editor , fewer than ten sentences long . When , the editor asked , might we expect to see the first draft of Hanging 's Too Good ? You 're six months overdue on it and as your contract stipulates .. . Suddenly everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherence . The texts on suicide , the workings of the police , the articles about death , the title of a new book . Lynley felt the tighteningof excitement that always came with knowing he was on the right track . He turned back to the word processor . It had two disks in it , hesaw , both a program disk and one that would contain Joy 's work . " Havers , " he shouted , " what do you know about computers ? " " A minute , " she returned . " I 've got . . . " Her voice lowered as shespoke into the phone.  |p168Im|patiently  , Lynley switched the machine on . In a moment , directions appeared on the screen . It was far simpler than he would have ever imagined . Within a minute he was looking at Joy 's working copy of Hanging 's Too Good . Unfortunately , the sum total of her manuscript  --  six months overdue to her publishers and no doubt the cause of her dispute with them  --  was one simple sentence : " Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1973 . " That was it . Fruitlessly , Lynley searched for something else , using every directionthat the computer program had to offer him . But nothing was there . Either her work had been erased , or that single sentence was as far as Joy Sinclair had gone . No wonder her editor is frothing at the mouth and talking about legal action , Lynley thought . He switched the machine off and gave his attention back to her desk . He spent the next ten minutes trying to find something more in the material there . Failing that , he went to her filing cabinet and began searching through its four drawers . He was on his second one when Havers came into the room . " Anything ? " she asked him . " A book called Hanging 's Too Good , someone named Hannah who decided to commit suicide , and a place called Porthill Green , P. Green , I should guess . What about you ? " " I 've begun to get the feeling that no one goes to work in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out that the New York number was for a literary agent . " " And the others ? " " The Somerset call was to Stinhurst 's home . " " What about the letter from Edna ? Did you telephone the publishinghouse about it ? " Havers nodded . " Joy sold a proposal to them early last year . She wanted to do something different , not a study of a criminal and victim which was her usual bent , but a study of a suicide , what led up to it and its aftereffects . The publisher bought the proposal  --  they 've not had to worry about her meeting deadlines before this . But that was the end of it . She never gave them a thing . They 've been after her for months . In fact , the reaction to her death sounded as if one of them may have been praying for it on a nightly basis . " " What about the other numbers ? " " The number in Suffolk was an interesting one , " Havers replied . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the slightest idea who Joy Sinclair was or why she might have been phoning his number . "  | " So what 's so interesting about that ? " " His name , Inspector . Teddy Darrow . His father 's name is John . And he was speaking to me from a pub called Wine 's the Plough . And that pub is sitting right in the middle of Porthill Green . " Lynley grinned , felt that swift surge of power that comes from validation . " By God , Havers . Sometimes I think we 're one hell of a team . We 're onto it now . Ca n't you feel it ? " Havers did n't respond . She was browsing through the material on the desk . " So we 've found the John Darrow that Joy talked about both at dinner and on her tape , " Lynley mused . " We 've the explanation for the reference on her calendar to P. Green . We 've the reason for the matchbook in her shoulder bag  --  she must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a connection between Joy 's book and John Darrow , between John Darrow and Westerbrae . " He looked at Havers sharply . " But there was another set of phone calls , was n't there ? To Wales . " Lynley watched her leaf through the newspaper clippings on the desk in an apparent need to scrutinise each one of them . She did n't appear to be reading , however . " They were to Llanbister . To a woman called Anghared Mynach . " " Why did Joy phone her ? " Again , there was hesitation . " She was looking for someone , sir . " Lynley 's eyes narrowed . He closed the filing drawer whose contentshe had been examining . " Who ? " Havers frowned . " Rhys Davies-Jones . Anghared Mynach is his sister . He was staying with her . " BARBARA SAW in Lynley 's face the swift assimilation of a series of ideas . She knew quite well the set of facts he was combining in his mind : the name John Darrow that was mentioned at dinner the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davies-Jones on Joy 's tape recorder ; the ten telephone calls to Porthill Green , and mixed in with those calls , six to Wales . Six calls made to Rhys Davies-Jones . To avoid a discussion of all of this , Barbara went to the pile of manuscripts lying near the study door . She began riffling through them curiously , noting the range of Joy Sinclair 's interest in murder and death : an outline for a study of the Yorkshire Ripper , an unfinished article on Crippen , at least sixty pages of material on Lord Mountbatten 's death , a hound galley from a book called Thep170Knife Plunges Once , three heavily edited versions of another book called Death in Darkness . But there was something missing . As Lynley involved himself again with the filing cabinet , Barbara went to the desk . She opened the top drawer . In it , Joy had kept her computer disks , two long rows of floppy black squares , all labelled by subject on the upper right-hand corner . Barbara flipped through them , reading the titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourish within her , like a growth that was swelling , not with malignancy but with tension . The second and third drawers were much the same , containing stationery , envelopes , ribbons for the printers , staples , ancient carbon paper , tape , scissors . But not what she was looking for . Nothing like that at all . When Lynley moved to the bookshelves and began looking through the materials there , Barbara went to the filing cabinet . " I 've been through that , Sergeant , " Lynley said . She sought an excuse . " Just a hunch , sir . It 'll only take a mo-ment . " The fact was that it took nearly an hour , but by that time Lynley had removed the jacket from a copy of Joy Sinclair 's most recent book , putting this into his pocket before going on into the bedroom and from there to the storage cabinet at the top of the stairs where Barbara could hear him rooting systematically through the assortment of belongings . It was after four o'clock when she concluded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfied with the validity of her hypothesis . Her only decision now was whether to tell Lynley or to hold her tongue until she had more facts , facts that he would be incapable of brushing aside . Why , she wondered , had he not noticed it himself ? How could he possibly have missed it ? With the glaring absence of material right before his eyes , he was seeing only what he wanted to see , what he needed to see , a trail of guilt leading directly to Rhys Davies-Jones . This guilt was so seductive a presence that it had become for Lynley an effective smokescreen hiding the one crucial detail that he had failed to note . Joy Sinclair had been in the midst of writing a play for Stuart Rintoul , Lord Stinhurst . And nowhere in the study was there a single reference to it . Not a draft , not an outline , not a list of characters , not a scrap of paper . Someone had been through the house before them.  | " I 'LL DROP YOU in Acton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . He headed down the street towards his car , a silver Bentley that had collected a small group of admiring schoolboys who were peering into its windows and running pious hands along its gleaming wings . " Let 's plan on an early start out to Porthill Green tomorrow . Half past seven ? " " Fine , sir . But do n't bother about Acton . I 'll catch the Tube . It 's just up on the corner of Heath Street and the high . " Lynley paused , turned back to her . " Do n't be ridiculous , Barbara . That 'll take an age . A change of stations and God only knows how many stops . Get in the car . " Barbara heard it as the order it was and looked for a way to deflect it without raising his ire . She could n't possibly waste the time of having him drive her all the way home . Her day was far from over , in spite of what he thought . Without considering how unlikely it would sound to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into her mind . " Actually , I 've a date , sir , " she said . And then knowing how ridiculous the idea was , she smoothed over the absurdity with , " Well , it 's not a date exactly . It 's someone I 've met . And we thought . . . well , perhaps we 'd have dinner and see that new film at the Odeon . " She winced inwardly at that last piece of creativity and took a moment to pray that there was a new film at the Odeon . Or at least if there was n't , that he would n't be the wiser . " Oh . I see . Well . Anyone I know ? " Hell , she thought . " No , just a bloke I met last week . At the supermarket , actually . We banged trolleys somewhere between tinned fruit and tea . " Lynley smiled at that . " Sounds exactly the way a meaningful relationship starts . Shall I drop you at the Tube ? " " No . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " He nodded , and she watched him stride towards his car . In an instant he was surrounded by the eager children who had been admiring it . " This your car , mister ? " " How much it cost ? " " Those seats leather ? " " C'n I drive it ? " Barbara heard Lynley laugh , saw him lean against the car , fold his arms , and take a moment to engage the group in friendly conversation . How like him , she thought . He 's had all of three hours sleep in the last thirty-three , he 's facing the fact that half of hisp172world may be as good as in ruins , and still he takes the time to listen to children 's chatter . Watching him with them  --  fancying from this distance that she could see the lines of laughter round his eyes and the quirky muscle that crooked his smile  --  she found herself wondering what she might actually be capable of doing to protect the career and integrity of a man like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tube . SNOW WAS FALLING when Barbara arrived at the St. James home on Cheyne Row in Chelsea that evening at eight . In the tawny glow of the street lamps , snowflakes looked like slivers of amber , floating down to blanket pavement , cars , and the intricate wrought iron of balconies and fences . The flurry was mild by way of winter storms , but even so , enough to snarl the traffic on the Embankment a block away . The usual roar of passing cars was considerably muted , and the occasional horn , honking in a burst of temper , explained why . Joseph Cotter , who played the unusual dual role of manservant and father-in-law in St. James ' life , answered the door to Barbara 's knock . He was , she guessed , no older than fifty , a balding man of short , solid physique , so physically unlike his willowy daughter that for some time after she had first met Deborah St. James , Barbara had had no idea that she was even related to this man . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best to avoid trampling a small , long-haired dachshund and a plump grey cat who were vying for attention at his feet . All of them threw grotesquely shaped shadows against the dark panelling on the wall . " Off wi ' you , Peach ! Alaska ! " he said , before he turned his ruddy face to greet Barbara . The animals retreated a respectable six inches . " Come in , Miss . . . Sergeant . Mr. St. James is in the study . " He looked Barbara over critically . " ' Ave you eaten yet , young lady ? Those two ' ave only finished just now . Let me get you a bite in a tick , shall I ? " " Thank you , Mr. Cotter . I could do with something . I have n't had a thing since this morning , I 'm afraid . " Cotter shook his head . " Police , " he said , in brief and eloquent disapproval . " You just wait in ' ere , miss . I 'll fix you up something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the stairs and without waiting for a response , swung it open . Barbara followed him into St. James ' study , a room of tall , crowded bookshelves , scores of photo/graphs , and intellectual jumble , one of the most pleasant locations in the Cheyne Row house . A fire had been lit , and the room 's mixed odours of leather and brandy formed a comfortable redolence , not unlike that one might find in a gentleman 's club . St. James occupied a chair by the hearth , his bad leg resting upon a worn ottoman , while across from him , Lady Helen Clyde was curled into a corner of the couch . They were sitting quietly , in the manner of an old married couple or of friends too close to need the bridge of conversation . " ' Ere 's the sergeant now , Mr. St. James , " Cotter said , bustling forward with the coffee , which he set down on a low table in front of the fire . Flames there cast a glow against the porcelain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An ' she 's not ' ad a bite to eat , so I 'll see to that at once if you 'll do the coffee on your own . " " I think we can manage that without disgracing you more than two or three times , Cotter . And if there 's any chocolate cake left , would you cut another piece for Lady Helen ? She 's longing to have one , but you know how she is . Far too well bred to ask for more . " " He 's lying as usual , " Lady Helen interjected . " It 's for himself but he knows how you 'll disapprove . " Cotter looked from one to the other , undeceived by their exchange . " Two pieces of chocolate cake , " he said meaningfully . " An ' a meal for the sergeant as well . " Flicking at the arm of his black jacket , he left the room . " You look about done in , " St. James said to Barbara when Cotter was gone . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coffee , Barbara ? " " At least ten cups , " she replied . She tugged off her coat and knit cap , tossed them down on the couch , and walked to the fire to thaw out her numb fingers . " It 's snowing . " Lady Helen shuddered . " After this past weekend , those are the last two words I look forward to hearing . " She handed St. James a cup of coffee and poured out two more . " I do hope your day was more productive than mine , Barbara . After spending five hours exploring Geoffrey Rintoul 's past , I 've begun to feel as though I 'm working for one of those committees in the Vatican who recommend candidates for canonisation . " She smiled at St. James . " Can you bear to hear it all again ? " " I long to , " he replied . " It allows me to examine my own disreputable past and feel suitable guilt over it . " " As well you should . " Lady Helen returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair that fell against her cheek . Shep174slipped off her shoes , curled her legs underneath her , and sipped her coffee . Even in exhaustion , she was graceful , Barbara noticed . Utterly confident . Completely at ease . Being in her presence was always an exercise in feeling ungainly and decidedly unattractive , and observingthe woman 's understated elegance , Barbara wondered how St. James ' wife placidly endured the fact that her husband and Lady Helen worked side by side three days each week in his forensic laboratory on the top floor of the house . Lady Helen reached for her handbag and pulled from it a small , black notebook . " After several hours with Debrett 's and Burke 's and Landed Gentry  --  not to mention a forty-minute stretch on the telephone with my father , who knows everything about everyone who 's ever had a title  --  I 've managed to come up with a rather remarkable portrait of our Geoffrey Rintoul . Let me see . " She opened the notebook , and her eyes skimmed down the first page . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rintoul , fourteenthEarl of Stinhurst , and his mother was Astrid Selvers , an American debutante in the fashion of the Vanderbilts who apparentlyhad the audacity to die in 1925 , leaving Francis with three small children to raise . He did so , with outstanding success , consideringGeoffrey 's accomplishments . " " He never remarried ? " " Never . It does n't even appear that he engaged in discreet affairs , either . But sexual disinclination seems to run in the family , as you shall note momentarily . " " How does that fit ? " Barbara asked . " Considering the affair between Geoffrey and his sister-in-law . " " A possible inconsistency , " St. James acknowledged . Lady Helen continued . " Geoffrey was educated at Harrow and Cambridge . Graduated from Cambridge in 1936 with a first in economics and assorted honours in speech and debate which went on and on forever . But he did n't come to anyone 's particular attentionuntil October of 1942 , and really , he appeared to be the most astonishing man . He was fighting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " His rank ? " " Captain . He was part of a tank crew . Apparently in one of the worst days of the fighting , his tank was hit , incapacitated , and ignited by a German shell . Geoffrey managed to get two wounded men out , dragging them more than a mile to safety . All in spite ofp175the fact that he was wounded himself . He was awarded the Victoria Cross . " " Hardly the sort of man one expects to find buried in an isolated grave , " Barbara commented . " And there 's more , " Lady Helen said . " At his own request , and in spite of the severity of his wounds that could well have put him out of action for the remainder of the war , he finished it up in the Allied front in the Balkans . Churchill was trying to preserve some British influence there in the face of potential Russian predominance , and evidently Geoffrey was a Churchill man through and through . When he came home , he moved into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm surprised a man like that did n't stand for Parliament . " " He was asked . Repeatedly . But he would n't do it . " " And he never married ? " " No . " St. James made a movement in his chair , and Lady Helen held out a hand to stop him . She rose herself and poured him a second cup of coffee , without a word . She merely frowned when he used the sugar too heavily and took the sugar bowl from him entirely when he dipped a spoon into it for the fifth time . " Was he homosexual ? " Barbara asked . " If he was , then he was discretion itself . Which applies to any affairs he may have had . Not a whisper of scandal about him . Anywhere . " " Not even anything that attaches him to Lord Stinhurst 's wife , Marguerite Rintoul ? " " Absolutely not . " " He 's too good to be true , " St. James remarked . " What do you have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own notebook from the pocket of her coat , Cotter entered with the promised food , cake for St. James and Lady Helen and a platter of cold meats , cheeses , and bread for Barbara . With , she saw , a third piece of cake to end her improvised meal . She smiled her thanks and Cotter gave her a friendly wink , checked the coffeepot , and disappeared through the door . His footstepssounded on the stairs in the hall . " Eat first , " Lady Helen advised . " With this chocolate cake in front of me , I 'm afraid I shall be markedly distracted from anything you say . We can go on when you 've finished your dinner . " With a grateful nod for the nicely veiled understanding so typical of Lady Helen , Barbara fell upon the food eagerly , devouring threep176pieces of meat and two large wedges of cheese like a prisoner of war . Finally , with the cake before her and another cup of coffee , she pulled out her notebook . " A few hours browsing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey 's death appeared to be an entirely straightforwardaffair . Most of this is from the newspaper accounts of the inquest . There was a tremendous storm on the night he died at Westerbrae , or actually in the early morning hours of January 1 , 1963 . " " That much is believable , considering what the weather was like this last weekend , " Lady Helen noted . " According to the officer in charge of the investigation  --  an Inspector Glencalvie  --  the section of the road where the accident occurred was sheeted with ice . Rintoul lost control on the switchback , went right over the side , and rolled the car several times . " " He was n't thrown out ? " " Apparently not . But his neck was broken and his body was burned . " Lady Helen turned to St. James at this . " But could n't that mean  --  " " No body-swapping in this day and age , Helen , " he interrupted . " No doubt they had dental charts and X rays to identify him . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The closest they could get to a witness was the owner of Hillview Farm . He heard the crash and was first on the scene . " " And he is ? " " Hugh Kilbride , Gowan 's father . " They ruminated upon this information for a moment . The fire crackled and popped as the flames reached a hard bubble of sap . " So I kept thinking , " Barbara went on slowly , " what did Gowan really mean when he said those two words did n't see to us ? Of course , at first I thought it had something to do with Joy 's death . But perhaps it did n't at all . Perhaps it referred to something his father had told him , a secret he was keeping . " " It 's a possibility , to be sure . " " And there 's something else . " She told them about her search through Joy Sinclair 's study , about the absence of any materials that referred to the play she had been writing for Lord Stinhurst . St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of forcible entry to the house ? " " None that I noticed . " " Could someone else have had a key ? " Lady Helen asked , thenp177went on to say , " But that 's not quite right , is it ? Everyone with an interest in the play was at Westerbrae , so how could her house .. . Unless someone rushed back to London and managed to get everything out of the study before you arrived . Yet that does n't seem at all likely , does it ? Or even possible . Besides , who would have a key ? " " Irene , I imagine . Robert Gabriel . Perhaps even . . . " Barbara hesitated . " Rhys ? " Lady Helen asked . Barbara felt a stirring of discomfort . She could read worlds into the manner in which Lady Helen had said the man 's name . " Possibly . There were a number of phone calls to him on her telephone bill . They were interspersed with calls to a place called Porthill Green . " Her loyalty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was walking on in this private investigation was insubstantial enough without giving Lady Helen any information which she might inadvertently or deliberately pass on to someone else . But Lady Helen required no further information . " And Tommy thinks that Porthill Green somehow gives Rhys a motive for murder . Of course . He 's looking for a motive . He told me as much . " " And yet , none of this takes us any closer to understanding Joy 's play , does it ? " St. James looked at Barbara . " Vassal , " he said . " Does that mean anything to you ? " She frowned . " Feudalism and fiefs . Should it mean something more ? " " It 's somehow connected to all of this , " Lady Helen answered . " It 's the only part of the play that stuck in my mind . " " Why ? " " Because it made no sense to anyone but the members of Geoffrey Rintoul 's family . And it made perfect sense to them . They reacted when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become another vassal . It seemed to be some sort of familial code word that only they understood . " Barbara sighed . " So where do we go from here ? " Neither St. James nor Lady Helen had an answer for her . They fell into several minutes of meditation that were broken by the sound of the front door opening and a young woman 's pleasant voice calling , " Dad ? I 'm home . Absolutely freezing and in desperate need of food . I 'll eat anything . Even steak and kidney pie , so you can see how immediately in danger of starvation I am . " Her light laughter followed . Cotter 's voice replied sternly from one of the upper floors . " Yourp178'usband 's eaten every crumb in the ' ouse , luv . And that 'll teach you to leave the poor man to ' is own devices all these hours . What 's the world comin ' to ? " " Simon ? He 's home so soon ? " Footsteps sounded hurriedly in the hall , the study door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My love , you did n't  --  " She stopped abruptly when she saw the other women . Her eyes went to her husband and she pulled off a beret the colour of cream , loosing an undisciplined mass of coppery red hair . She was dressed in business clothes  --  a fine coat of ivory wool over a grey suit  --  and she carried a large metal camera case which she set down near the door . " I 've been doing a wedding , " she explained . " And together with the reception , I thought I 'd never escape . You 're all of you back from Scotland so soon ? What 's happened ? " A smile broke over St. James ' face . He held out his hand and his wife crossed the room to him . " I know exactly why I married you , Deborah , " he said , kissing her warmly , , tangling his hand in her hair . " Photographs ! " " And I always thought it was because you were absolutely mad for my perfume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " St. James pushed himself out of his chair and went to his desk . There , he rooted through a large drawer and pulled out a telephone directory which he opened quickly . " Whatever are you doing ? " Lady Helen asked him . " Deborah 's just given us the answer to Barbara 's question , " St. James replied . " Where do we go from here ? To photographs . " He reached for the telephone . " And if they exist , Jeremy Vinney is the one man who can get them . "  |p179PORTHILL  GREEN was a village that looked as if it had grown , like an unnatural protuberance , out of the peat-rich earth ofthe East Anglian Fens . Close to the centre of a rough triangle created by the Suffolk and Cambridgeshire towns of Brandon , Mildenhall , and Ely , the village was not a great deal more than the intersection of three narrow lanes that wound through fields of sugar beets , traversing chalky brown canals by means of bridges barely the width of a single car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colours grey , brown , and green  --  from the cheerless winter sky , to the loamy fields dotted irregularly by patchy snow , to the vegetation that bordered the lanes in thick abundance . The village possessed little to recommend itself . Nine buildings of knapped flint and four of plaster , carelessly half-timbered in a drunken pattern , lined the high street . Those that were places of business announced that fact with signs of chipped and sooty paint . A lone petrol station , with pumps that appeared to be fabricated largely from rust and glass , stood sentry on the outskirts of the village . And at the end of the high street , marked by a weathersmoothedCeltic cross , lay a circle of dirty snow under which no doubt grew the grass for which the village was named . Lynley parked here , for the green lay directly across from Wine 's the Plough , a building no different from any of the other sagging structures on the street . He examined it while next to him Sergeant Havers buttoned her coat beneath her chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , originally , the pub had simply been called The Plough , and that on either side of its name had been fixed the words Wines and Liquors . The latter had fallen off sometime in the past , however , leaving merely a dark patch on the wall where the word had once been , the shape of its letters still legible . Rather than replace Liquors , or even repaint the building for that matter , to the first word had been added an apostrophe by means of a tin mug nailed into the plaster . Thus the building was renamed , no doubt to someone 's amusement . " It 's the same village , Sergeant , " Lynley said after a cursory examination through the windscreen . Aside from a liver-coloured mongrel sniffing along an ill-formed hedge , the place might have been abandoned . " Same as what , sir ? " " As that drawing posted in Joy Sinclair 's study . The petrol station , the greengrocers . There 's the cottage set back behind the church as well . She 'd been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no doubt someone will remember her . You take care of the high while I have a word with John Darrow . " Havers reached for the door handle with a sigh of resignation . " Always the footwork , " she groused . " Good exercise to clear your head after last night . " She looked at him blankly . " Last night ? " " Dinner , film ? The chap from the supermarket ? " " Oh , that , " Havers said , fidgeting in her seat . " Believe me , it was very forgettable , sir . " She got out of the car , letting in a gust of air that commingled the faint odours of the sea , dead fish , and rotting debris , and strode over to the first building , disappearing behind its weathered black door . By pub hours it was early yet , the drive from London having taken them less than two hours , so Lynley was not surprised to find the door locked when he tried to enter Wine 's the Plough across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above to what seemed to be a flat , but his observation gained him nothing . Limp curtains served as a barrier against prying eyes . No one was about at all , and there was no automobile or motorbike to indicate that the building was currently under anyone 's ownership . Nonetheless , when Lynley peered through the grimy windows of the pub itself , a missing slat in one of the shutters revealed a light shining in a far doorway that appeared to lead to the building 's cellar stairs . He returned to the door and knocked upon it soundly . Within moments , he heard heavy footsteps . They trudged to the door.  | " Not opened , " a man 's gravelly voice said behind it . " Mr. Darrow ? " " Aye . " " Would you open the door please ? " " Y'r business is ? " " Scotland Yard CID . " That got a reaction , although not much of one . The door was unbolted and held open a mere six or seven inches . " All 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hazelnuts , the colour of a brown gone bad with yellow , dropped to the identification that Lynley held . " May I come in ? " Darrow did n't look up as he considered the request and the limited responses available to him . " Not about Teddy , is it ? " " Your son ? No , it 's nothing to do with him . " Apparently satisfied , the man held the door open wider , stepped back , and admitted Lynley into the pub . It was a humble establishment , in keeping with the village it served . Its sole decoration appeared to be a variety of unlit signs behind and above the Formicatoppedbar , identifying the liquors sold on the premises . There was very little furniture : half a dozen small tables surrounded by stools and a bench running beneath the front windows . This was padded , but the cushion was sun-bleached from its original red to rusty pink , and dark stains patterned it . A stinging burnt smell tinctured the air , a combination of cigarette smoke , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long closed against the winter weather . Darrow positioned himself behind the bar , perhaps with the intention of treating Lynley like a customer in spite of the hour and his police identification . For his part , Lynley followed suit in front of it although it meant standing and he would much rather have conducted this interview at one of the tables . Darrow , he guessed , was in his mid-forties , a rough-looking man who projected a decided air of suppressed violence . He was built like a boxer , squat , with long , powerful limbs , a barrel chest , and incongruouslysmall , well-shaped ears which lay flat against his skull . His clothes suited him . They suggested a man able to make the transition from publican to brawler in the time it would take to ball up a fist . He wore a wool shirt , with cuffs turned up to reveal hirsute arms , and a pair of loose-fitting trousers for ease of movement . Evaluating all this , Lynley doubted that any fist fights broke out in Wine 's the Plough unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jacket of Death in Darkness , which hep182had taken from Joy Sinclair 's study . Removing it , he folded it so that the author 's smiling photograph was facing up . " Do you know this woman ? " he asked . Recognition flickered unmistakably in Darrow 's eyes . " I know her . What of it ? " " She was murdered three nights ago . " " I was here three nights ago , " Darrow replied . His tone was surly . " Saturday 's my busiest . Anyone in the village ' 11 tell you as much . " It was n't at all the reaction Lynley had been expecting . Perhaps surprise , perhaps confusion , perhaps reserve . But a reflex denial of culpability ? That was unusual , to say the least . " She 's been here to see you , " Lynley stated . " She telephoned this pub ten times in the last month . " " What of it ? " " I expect you to tell me that . " The publican seemed to be evaluating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his show of belligerent uncooperation produced virtually no reaction in the London detective . " I was having none of her , " he said . " She wanted to write a flipping book . " " About Hannah ? " Lynley asked . The tightening of Darrow 's jaw tensed every muscle in his face . " Aye . Hannah . " He went to an upturned bottle of Bushmill 's Black Label and pushed a glass against its spigot . He drained the whisky , not in a single gulp but in two or three slow swallows , all taken with his back to Lynley . " Have one ? " he asked , drawing himself another . " No . " The man nodded , drank again . " She came out of nowhere , " he said . " Bringing a clutch of newspaper clippings about this and that book that she 'd written , and going on about awards she 'd received and . . . I do n't know what else . And she plain expected me to give her Hannah and be thankful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't having it . And I was n't having my Teddy exposed to that kind of muck . It 's bad enough with his mum doing herself in and providing the local ladies with gossip till he was ten years old . I was n't about to have it start again . Raking it all up . Upsetting the lad . " " Hannah was your wife ? " " Aye . My wife . " " How did Joy Sinclair happen to know about her ? " " Claimed she 'd been studying up on suicides for nine or tenp183months to find one she thought interesting , and she 'd read of Hannah 's . Caught her eye , she said . " His voice was sour . " Can you credit that , man ? Caught her eye . Han was n't a person to her . She was a piece of meat . So I told her to fuck herself . In just those words . " " Ten telephone calls suggests that she was rather persistent . " Darrow snorted . " Made no difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what had happened . So she could n't talk to him . And she was getting nothing from me . " " May I take it that without your cooperation , there could be no book ? " " Aye . No book . Nothing . And that 's the way it was going to stay . " " When she came to see you , was she alone ? " " Aye . " " Never anyone with her ? Perhaps someone waiting out in the car ? " Darrow 's eyes narrowed suspiciously . They darted to the windowsand back . " What d' you mean ? " It had seemed a straightforward question to Lynley . He wondered if Darrow was temporising . " Did she come with a companion ? " " She was always alone . " " Your wife killed herself in 1973 , did n't she ? Did Joy Sinclair ever give you any indication why a suicide that long ago was of interest to her ? " Darrow 's face darkened . His lips curled with loathing . " She liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that . She liked the bleeding chair . " " The chair ? " " Right . Han lost a shoe when she kicked over the chair . And the woman fancied that . She called it . . . poignant . " He turned back to the Bushmill 's . " Begging your pardon if I do n't particularly care that someone murdered the bitch . " ST . JAMES and his wife were both working at their respective interests on the top floor of their house , St. James in his forensic laboratory and Deborah in her developing room that adjoined it . The door between the two was open , and looking up from the report that he was compiling for the defence team in an upcoming trial , St. James engaged in a moment of simple pleasure , watching his wife . She was frowning over a collection of her photographs , a pencilp184stuck behind one ear and a mass of curly hair drawn back from her face with a set of combs . The light above glittered against her head like a halo . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopeless . Pathetic , " she murmured , scribbling on the back of one picture and tossing another into a rubbish box at her feet . " Blasted light . . . God in heaven , Deborah , where did you learn the basic elements of composition ! . . . Oh Lord , this is even worse ! " St. James laughed at that . Deborah looked up . " Sorry , " she said . " Am I distracting you ? " " You always distract me , my love . Far too much , I 'm afraid . And especially when I 've been away from you for twenty-four hours or more . " A faint colour rose in her cheeks . " Well , after a year , I 'm glad to hear there 's a bit of romance left between us . I . . . silly though , is n't it ? Were you really only gone one night to Scotland ? I missed you , Simon . I find that I do n't care for going to bed without you any longer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall stool and crossed the lab to join her in the semi-darkness of the developing room . " No , my love . . . I really did n't mean . . . Simon , we 'll get no work done like this , " she said in insincere protest when he took her into his arms . St. James laughed quietly , said , " Well , we 'll get other things done , wo n't we ? " and kissed her . A long moment later , he murmuredappreciatively against her mouth , " Lord . Yes . Far more important things , I think . " They parted guiltily at the sound of Cotter 's voice . He was pounding up the stairway , talking several volumes louder than he usually did . " Just up ' ere , they both are , " he boomed . " Workin ' in the lab , I should guess . Deb 's got ' er snaps out and Mr. St. James is doin ' a report o ' some sort . ' T is just up above . Not a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick . " This last pronouncement was made louder than all the others . Deborah laughed when she heard it . " I never know whether to be appalled or amused by my father , " she whispered . " How can he possibly be wise to what we 're up to all the time ? " " He sees the way I look at you , and that 's evidence enough . Believe me , your father knows exactly what I have on my mind . " St. James dutifully returned to his lab and was writing away upon his report when Cotter appeared at the door with Jeremy Vinney behind him . " ' Ere you are , " Cotter said expansively . " Bit of a climb that ,  |p185is  n't it ? " He cast a look here and there as if to make certain he had n't caught his daughter and her husband in flagrante delicto . Vinney betrayed no surprise at the stentorian manner in which Cotter had heralded his arrival . Rather he came forward , a manila folder in one hand . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on his jawline ran a thin line of whiskers that he 'd missed in shaving . He had not as yet bothered to take off his overcoat . " I think I have what you need , " he said to St. James as Cotter directed an affectionate scowl at his daughter 's impish smile before departing . " Perhaps a bit more . The fellow who covered Geoffrey Rintoul 's inquest in sixty-three is one of our senior editors now , so we rooted through his files this morning and came up with three photographs and a set of old notes . They 're hardly legible since they were done in pencil , but we might be able to make something out of them . " He gave St. James a look that endeavoured to read beneath the surface . " Did Stinhurst kill Joy ? Is that where you 're heading ? " The question was a logical conclusion to everything that had gone before , and not an unreasonable one for the journalist to ask . But St. James was not unaware of what it implied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred at Westerbrae , as newsman , friend of deceased , and suspect . It was to his advantage to have that last entitlement removed entirely in the eyes of the police , to see that suspicion passed on to someone else . And after a show of fine , journalistic cooperation , what better person to see that it was done than St. James himself , known to be Lynley 's friend ? He answered Vinney cautiously . " There 's merely a small oddity about Geoffrey Rintoul 's death that has us intrigued . " If the journalist was disappointed with the obliquity of the reply , he was careful not to show it . " Yes . I see . " He shrugged out of his overcoat and accepted the introduction to St. James ' wife . Placing the manila folder onto the lab table , he drew out its contents , a sheaf of papers and three tattered pictures . When he spoke again , it was with professional formality . " The inquest notes are quite complete . Our man was hoping for a feature on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was careful about the details . I think you can rely on his accuracy . " The notes were written on yellow paper which did not make the faded pencil any easier to read . " It says something about an argument , " St. James remarked , looking them over . Vinney drew a lab stool over to the table . " The testimony of thep186family was fairly straightforward at the inquest . Old Lord Stinhurst  --  FrancisRintoul , the present earl 's father  --  said there had been quite a row before Geoffrey took off that New Year 's Eve . " " A row ? About what ? " St. James scanned for the details as Vinney supplied them . " Apparently a semi-drunken spat that started delving into the family history . " That was very close to what Lynley had reported of his conversation with the current earl . But it was hard for St. James to believe that old Lord Stinhurst would have discussed his two sons ' love triangle before a coroner 's jury . Family loyalty would have precluded that . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vinney pointed to a section midway down the page . " Apparently Geoffrey was hot to get back to London and decided to take off that night in spite of the storm . His father testified that he did n't want him to go . Because of the weather . Because he had n't seen much of Geoffrey for the past six months and wanted to keep him there while he could . Evidently , their recent relationship had n't been smooth , and the old earl saw this New Year 's gathering as a way to heal the breach between them . " " What sort of breach ? " " I gathered that the earl had taken Geoffrey under considerable fire for not marrying . I suppose he wanted Geoffrey to feel duty bound to shore up the ancestral house . At any rate , that was what was at the heart of the trouble in their relationship . " Vinney studied the notes before he went on delicately , as if he had come to understand how important a show of impartiality might be when discussing the Rintoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man was used to having things his way . So when Geoffrey decided to return to London , his father lost his temper and the argument grew from there . " " Is there any indication why Geoffrey wanted to return to London ? A woman friend that his father would n't have approved of ? Or perhaps a relationship with a man that he wanted to keep under wraps ? " There was an odd , unaccountable hesitation , as if Vinney were trying to read St. James ' words for an additional meaning . He cleared his throat . " There 's nothing to indicate that . No one ever came forward to claim an illicit relationship with him . And consider the tabloids . If someone had been involved with Geoffrey Rintoul on the side , he or she would probably have come forward and sold the story for a good deal of money once he was dead . God knows that'sp187the way things were happening in the early sixties , with call girls servicing what seemed like half the top ministers in the government . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the Tories reeling . So it does seem that if someone Geoffrey Rintoul was involved with needed the money , he or she would merely have followed in Keeler 's footsteps . " St. James responded pensively . " There is something in what you 're saying , is n't there ? Perhaps more than we realise . John Profumowas state secretary for war . Geoffrey Rintoul worked for the Ministry of Defence . Rintoul 's death and inquest were in January , the very same month that John Profumo 's sexual relationship with Keeler was brewing in the press . Is there some sort of connection between these people and Geoffrey Rintoul that we 're failing to see ? " Vinney seemed to warm to the plural pronoun . " I wanted to think so . But if any call girl had been involved with Rintoul , why would she have held her tongue when the tabloids were willing to pay a fortune for a juicy story about someone in government ? " " Perhaps it was n't a call girl at all . Perhaps Rintoul was involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have benefitted from the disclosure . " " A married woman ? " Once again they were back to Lord Stinhurst 's original story about his brother and his wife . St. James pushed past it . " And the testimony of the others ? " " They all supported the old earl 's story of the argument , Geoffreygoing off in a rage , and the accident on the switchback . There was something rather odd , however . The body was badly burned , so they had to send to London for X rays and dental charts to use in the formal identification . Geoffrey 's physician , a man called Sir Andrew Higgins , brought them personally . He did the examination along with Strathclyde 's pathologist . " " Unusual but not out of the range of belief . " " That 's not it . " Vinney shook his head . " Sir Andrew was a longtime school friend of Geoffrey 's father . They 'd been at Harrow and Cambridge together . They were in the same London club . He died in 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new revelation . Sir Andrew may have hidden what needed to be hidden . He may have brought forth only what needed to be brought forth . Yet , all the disjointed pieces of information considered , the time period  --  Janu/ary 1963  --  struck St. James as the most relevant item . He could n't have said why . He reached for the photographs . The first was of a group of black-garbed people about to climb into a row of parked limousines . St. James recognised most of them . Francesca Gerrard clinging to the arm of a middle-aged man , presumablyher husband Phillip ; Stuart and Marguerite Rintoul bendingover to speak to two bewildered children , obviously Elizabeth and her older brother Alec ; several people forming a conversational circle on the steps of the building in the background , their faces blurry . The second picture was of the accident site with its scar of burnt land . Standing next to it was a roughly dressed farmer , a border collie at his side . Hugh Kilbride , Gowan 's father , St. James speculated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group leaving a building , most likely the site of the inquest itself . Once again , St. James recognised the people he had met at Westerbrae . But this photograph contained several unfamiliar faces . " Who are these people ? Do you know ? " Vinney pointed as he spoke . " Sir Andrew Higgins is directly behind the old Earl of Stinhurst . Next to him is the family solicitor . You know the others , I presume . " " Save this man , " St. James said . " Who is he ? " The man in question was behind and to the right of the old Earl of Stinhurst , his head turned in conversation to Stuart Rintoul , who listened , frowning , one hand pulling at his chin . " Not a clue , " Vinney said . " The chap who took the notes for the story might know , but I did n't think to ask him . Shall I take them back and have a go ? " St. James thought about it . " Perhaps , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deborah , will you have a look at these please ? " His wife joined them at the table , gazing over St. James ' shoulder at the photographs . After giving her a moment to evaluate them , St. James said , " Can you do a set of enlargements from this last one ? Individual pictures of each person , mostly each face ? " She nodded . " They 'd be quite grainy , of course , certainly not the best quality , but recognisable . Shall I set up to do it ? " " Please , yes . " St. James looked at Vinney . " We shall have to see what our current Lord Stinhurst has to say about these . " THE POLICE in Mildenhall had conducted the investigation into Hannah Darrow 's suicide . Raymond Plater , the investigating officer , was , in fact , now the town 's chief constable . He was a man whop189wore authority like a suit of clothes into which he had grown more and more comfortable with the passage of time . So he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on his doorstep to talk about a case fifteen years closed . " I remember it , all right , " he said , leading Lynley and Havers into his well-appointed office . He adjusted beige venetian blinds in a manner of proud ownership , then picked up a telephone , dialled three numbers , and said , " Plater here . Will you bring me the file on Darrow , Hannah . D-a-r-r-o-w . It 'll be in 1973 . . . . A closed case .. . Right . " He swivelled his chair to a table behind his desk and tossed back over his shoulder , " Coffee ? " When the other two accepted his offer , Plater did the honours with an efficient-looking coffee maker , passing steaming mugs over to them along with milk and sugar . He himself drank appreciatively , yet with remarkable delicacy for a man so energetic and so fierce of feature . With its implacable jaw and clear Nordic eyes , his face reflected the savage Viking warriors from whom he no doubt had taken his blood . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darrow woman , " he said , leaning back in his chair . " The writer Joy Sinclair was here , " Lynley responded , and to Plater 's quickly cocked head , added , " She was murdered this past weekend in Scotland . " The chief constable 's adjustment in position indicated his interest . " Is there a connection ? " " Merely a gut feeling at the moment . Did Sinclair come to you alone ? " " Yes . Persistent she was , too . Arrived without an appointment , and as she was n't a member of the Force , there was a bit of a wait . " Plater smiled . " Just over two hours , as I recall . But she put in the time , so I went ahead and saw her . This was ... sometime early last month . " " What did she want ? " " Conversation mostly . A look at what we had on the Darrow woman . Ordinarily I would n't have made it available to anyone , but she had two letters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with on a book and another from a detective superintendentsomewhere in the south . Devon , perhaps . Beyond that , she 'd an impressive list of credentials  --  at least two Silver Daggers , I recall  --  that she was n't above showing off to convince me she was n't hanging about the entrance hall in the hope of an hour 's natter . " A deferential knock upon the door heralded a young constablep190who handed his chief a thick folder and made himself scarce . Plater opened the folder and drew out a stack of police photographs . They were , Lynley saw , standard crime-scene work . Starkly black and white , they still depicted death with grim attention to detail , going so far as to include an elongated shadow cast by the hanging body of Hannah Darrow . There was little else to see . The room was virtually unfurnished , with an open-beam ceiling , a floor of wide but badly pitted planks , and rough-hewn wooden walls . These appeared to be curved , small four-paned windows their only decoration . A plain cane-seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her shoes had fallen off and rested against a rung . She had not used rope , but rather what appeared to be a dark scarf , attached to a hook in a ceiling beam , and her head hung forward with long blonde hair curtaining the worst distortion of her face . Lynley scrutinised the photographs , one after another , feeling a twinge of uncertainty . He handed them to Havers and watched as she sorted through them , but she returned them to Plater without remark . " Where were the photographs taken ? " he asked the chief constable . " She was found in a mill out on Mildenhall Fen , about a mile from the village . " " Is the mill still there ? " Plater shook his head . " Torn down three or four years past , I 'm afraid . Not that it would do you too much good to see it . Although , " his voice was momentarily reflective , " the Sinclair woman asked to see it as well . " " Did she ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered what John Darrow had told him : Joy had taken ten months to find the death she wanted to write about . " Are you absolutely certain this was a suicide ? " he asked the chief constable . In answer , Plater riffled through the file . He brought out a single piece of notebook paper . Torn in several places , it bore the trace of creases from having been crumpled and then pressed in among other papers to smooth it out . Lynley scanned the few words , written in a large , childish script with rounded letters and tiny circles used in place of periods and dots . I must go , it 's time . . . There 's a tree that 's dead , but it goes on swaying in the wind with the others . So it seems top191me that if I die , I 'll still have a part in life , one way or another . Good-bye , my darling . " Pretty straightforward , that , " Plater commented . " Where was this found ? " " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside it , Inspector . " " Who found it ? " " Her husband . Evidently , she was supposed to help him in the pub that night . When she did n't show up , he went upstairs to their flat . He saw the note , panicked , ran out looking for her . When he could n't find her , he came back , closed the pub , and got up a group of men for a proper search . She was found in the mill , " Plater referred to the file , " shortly after midnight . " " Who found her ? " " Her husband . Accompanied , " he noted hastily when he saw Lynley start to speak , " by two blokes from the village who were no particular friends of his . " Plater smiled affably . " I expect you 're thinking what we all thought at first , Inspector . That Darrow lured his wife out to the mill , strung her up , and fashioned the note himself . But we checked on that angle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And although both their prints were on the paper  --  Hannah 's and her husband 's  --  his are explained away easily enough . He 'd picked up the paper from the kitchen table where she 'd left it for him . Hardly questionable behaviour under the circumstances . Besides , Hannah Darrow was wearing plenty of ballastthat night to make certain she did the job right and proper . She had on two wool coats and two heavy sweaters . And you ca n't tell me her husband talked her into going for an evening stroll all done up like that . " THE AGINCOURT THEATRE was tucked between two far more impressive structures on a narrow street off Shaftesbury Avenue . To its left was the Royal Standard Hotel , complete with a uniformed doorman who scowled at pedestrians and traffic alike . To its right was the Museum of Theatrical History , its front windows filled with a dazzling display of Elizabethan costumes , weaponry , and props . Sandwiched between these two , the Agincourt had the appearance of neglect and disrepair , qualities disproved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde entered shortly before noon , she pausedp192in surprise . The last time she had seen a production here the building had been under different ownership , and although its formergloomy Victorian interior had possessed a certain Dickensian charm , Lord Stinhurst 's renovation was breathtaking . She had read about it in the paper , of course , but nothing had prepared her for such a metamorphosis . Stinhurst had given both architects and designers free rein in orchestrating the theatre 's improvements . Following a no-holds-barred philosophy of interior design , they had gutted the building completely , achieving light and space through their creation of an entrance that soared with three full floors of open balconies , and through their use of colours that contrasted sharply with the soot-covered exterior which the building presented to the street . Admiring the wealth of creativity that had altered the theatre , Lady Helen allowed herself to forget some of the trepidation with which she had been anticipating her coming interview . With Sergeant Havers and St. James , she had gone over the details until nearly midnight . Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this visit to the Agincourt . Since Havers was unable to get to the theatre without Lynley 's knowledge and do the job properly under the aegis of the police , it was left to the devices of either Lady Helen or St. James to encourage Lord Stinhurst'ssecretary to talk about the telephone calls which her employerclaimed she had placed for him on the morning that Joy Sinclair 's body was found . Their late night discussion ended with a consensus that Lady Helen was the likeliest one among them to encourage an offering of confidences from anyone . All that had sounded reasonable enough at midnight  --  even a bit complimentary if one wanted to take it that way  --  but it was far from reassuring right now with the Agincourt 's offices a mere ten steps away and Stinhurst 's secretary waiting unwittingly in one of them . " Helen ? Have you come to join the newest fray ? " Rhys Davies-Jones was standing at the auditorium door , a mug in his hand . Lady Helen smiled and joined him at the bar where coffee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part chicory . " Worst coffee in the world , " Davies-Jones acknowledged . " But one develops a taste for it over time . Will you have some ? " When she declined , he poured himself a mug . The liquid was black , resembling overused motor oil . " What newest fray ? " she asked him . " Perhaps fray is n't the best choice of words , " he admitted . " It'sp193more like political manoeuvring among our tender players for the best part in Stinhurst 's new production . With the only difficulty being that the play has n't been decided upon yet . So you can well imagine the jockeying for position that 's been going on for the last two hours . " " New production ? " Lady Helen asked . " You do n't mean that Lord Stinhurst intends to go on with a play after what 's happened to Joy and Gowan ? " " He has no choice , Helen . We 're all of us under contract to him . The theatre 's due to open in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he loses his shirt . I ca n't say he 's at all happy about it , however . And he 's going to be a good sight unhappier the moment the press start storming him about what happened to Joy . I ca n't think why the media have n't picked up on the story . " He touched Lady Helen 's hand lightly where it lay on the bar . " That 's why you 're here , is n't it ? " She had n't thought she would see him , had n't considered what she might say if she did . Unprepared for his question , she answered with the first thing that came into her mind , not even thinking for the moment about why she was lying . " Actually , no . I found myself in the neighbourhood . I thought you might be here , so I took the chance of dropping in . " His eyes remained perfectly steady on her own , but they managed to convey how ridiculous her story sounded . He was not the kind of man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Nor was she the kind of woman who would ever do so . He knew that quite well . " Right . Yes , I see . " He studied his coffee , moved the mug from one hand to the other . When he spoke again , it was with an altered tone , one deliberately light and unaffected . " Come into the auditoriumthen . There 's not much to see since we 've got virtually nothing at all done . But there have been sparks aplenty . Joanna 's been harassing David Sydeham all morning with an endless list of complaintsthat she wants him to handle , and Gabriel 's been attempting to pour oil on their troubled waters . He 's managed to alienate nearly everyone present , but most particularly Irene . The meeting may well turn into a brawl , yet it does have some amusement value . Will you join us ? " After the manufactured excuse for her presence at the theatre , Lady Helen knew she could hardly refuse . So she followed him into the dark auditorium and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her politely and began to walk towards the brightly lit stage wherep194the players , Lord Stinhurst , and several other people were gathered round a table , their voices raised in discussion . " Rhys , " she called . When he turned back to her , she said , " May I see you tonight ? " It was part contrition and part desire . But which was the greater and more pressing , she could not have said . She knew only that she could n't leave him today on a lie . " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't , Helen . I 've a meeting with Stuart ... Lord Stinhurst about the new production . " " Oh . Yes , of course . I was n't thinking . Then perhaps sometime " Tomorrow night ? For dinner , if you 're free . If that 's what you want . " " I . . . yes . Yes , it 's what I want . Truly . " He stood in shadow , so she could not see his face . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness behind them . The timbre of his voice told her the cost of his speaking at all . " Helen . I woke up this morning knowing with perfect certainty that I love you . So much . God help me , but I do n't understand why no other moment in my life has ever been quite as frightening . " " Rhys  --  " " No . Please . Tell me tomorrow . " He turned decisively and walked down the aisle , up the steps to join the others . Left alone , Lady Helen forced her eyes to remain on the stage , but her thoughts would not . Instead , they attached themselves stubbornly to a reflection on loyalty . If this encounter with Rhys were a test of her devotion to him , she saw that , without even thinking , she had failed it miserably . And she wondered if that momentary failure meant the very worst , if in her heart she questionedwhat Rhys had really done two nights ago while she was asleep at Westerbrae . The very thought was devastating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she returned to the entrance hall and approached the office doors . She decided against an elaborate fabrication . She would face Stinhurst 's secretary with the truth . That commitment to honesty would , in this case , be a wise decision . " IT 'S THE CHAIR , Havers , " Lynley was saying once again , possibly for the fourth or fifth time . The afternoon was growing unbearably cold . A frigid wind had swept in from The Wash and was tearing across the Fens , unbroken by woodland or hills . Lynley made the turn back towards Porthillp195Green just as Barbara concluded her third examination of the suicide photographs and replaced them in the Darrow file that Chief ConstablePlater had loaned them . She shook her head inwardly . As far as she could tell , the case he was building was more than tenuous ; it was virtually nonexistent . " I do n't see how you can possibly reach any viable conclusion from looking at a picture of a chair , " she said . " Then you look at it again . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its side ? It could n't have been done . She could have kicked at the back of it , or even turned it sideways and still kicked at the back of it . But in either case , the chair would have fallen onto its back , not onto its side . The only way for the chair to end up in that position at Hannah Darrow 's own doing would be if she had twisted her foot into the space between the seat and the back and actually tried to toss the thing . " " It could have happened . She was missing a shoe , " Barbara reminded him . " Indeed . But she was missing her right shoe , Havers . And if you look again , you 'll see that the chair was tipped over to her left . " Barbara saw that he was determined to win her to his way of thinking . There seemed little point to a further protest . Nonetheless , she felt compelled to argue . " So what you 're saying is that Joy Sinclair , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murder instead . How ? Out of all the suicides in the country , how could she possibly have stumbled onto one that was a murder ? Good God , what do you think the odds are for doing that ? " " But consider why she was attracted to Hannah Darrow 's death in the first place , Havers . Look at all the oddities involved that would have made it stand out glaringly in comparison to any others she looked at . The location : the Fens . A system of canals , periodic floods , land reclaimed from the sea . All the natural characteristics that have made it the inspiration of everyone from Dickens to Dorothy Sayers . How did Joy describe it on her tape ? " The sound of frogs and pumps , the unremittingly flat land . ' Then there 's the site of the suicide : an old abandoned mill . The bizarre clothing she was wearing : two wool coats over two wool sweaters . And then the inconsistency that surely must have struck Joy the moment she saw those police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is an inconsistency , how do you explain the fact that Plater himself overlooked it during the investigation ? He does n't exactly seem to he your humbling Lestrade type . " " By the time Plater got there , all the men from the pub had beenp196searching for Hannah , all of them convinced that they were looking for a suicide . And when they found her and telephoned for the police , they reported a suicide . Plater was predisposed to believe that 's exactly what he was looking at when he got to the mill . So he 'd lost objectivity before he ever saw the body . And he was given fairly convincing evidence that Hannah Darrow had indeed intended to kill herself when she left her flat . The note . " " But you heard Plater say it was genuine enough . " " Of course it 's genuine , " Lynley said . " I 'm certain it 's her hand-writing . " " Then how do you explain  --  " " Good God , Havers , look at the thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a point of punctuation that she even missed ? " Barbara took it out , glanced at it , turned to Lynley . " Are you trying to say that this is something Hannah Darrow copied ? Why ? Was she practising her handwriting ? Acting out of sheer boredom ? Life in Porthill Green looks like it might be less than ducky , but I do n't exactly see a village girl whiling'away her time by improving her script . And even if she did , are you going to argue that Darrow found this note somewhere and realised how he could use it ? That he had the foresight to stow it away until the time was right ? That he put it out on the kitchen table ? That he . . . what ? Killed his wife ? How ? When ? And how did he get her to wear all those clothes ? And even if he managed it all without raising anyone 's suspicion , how on earth is he connected to Westerbrae and Joy Sinclair 's death ? " " Through the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over . Joy Sinclair innocently telling her cousin Rhys Davies-Jonesabout her frustrations in dealing with John Darrow , not to mention her budding suspicions about Hannah 's death . And Davies-Jones biding his time , suggesting that Joy arrange to have a room next to Helen , then finishing her off the moment he saw his chance . " Barbara heard him , incredulous . Once again she saw how he was turning and interpreting all the facts skilfully , using only what he needed to take him closer to an arrest of Davies-Jones . " Why ? " she demanded in exasperation . " Because there 's a connection between Darrow and Davies-Jones . I do n't know what it is yet . Perhaps an old relationship . Perhaps a debt to be paid . Perhaps mutual knowledge . But whatever it is , we 're getting closer to finding it . "  |p197WINE  'S THE PLOUGH was just minutes short of its midafternoonclosing when Lynley and Havers entered . John Darrow made no secret of his displeasure at seeing them . " Closing , " he barked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Instead , he approached the bar , opened the file , and took out Hannah Darrow 's suicide note . Next to him , Havers flipped open her notebook . Darrow watched all this with his mouth pressed into a hostile line . " Tell me about this , " Lynley suggested , passing the note across to him . The man gave it a moment 's sullen , cursory attention , but he said nothing . Instead , he began gathering the pint glasses that lined the bar , dousing them furiously into a pan of murky water beneath it . " How much education did your wife have , Mr. Darrow ? Did she finish school ? Did she go to university ? Or was she self-educated ? A great reader , perhaps ? " Darrow 's scowling face revealed a stumbling search through Lynley 's words for a trap . Apparently not finding one , he said shortly , " Hannah did n't hold with books . She 'd had enough of school at fifteen . " " I see . But interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  |p198The  man 's lips moved in a quick snarl of contempt . " What d' you want with me , pommy boy ? Have your say and get out . " " She writes here about trees . And a tree that died but still sways in the wind . Rather poetic , would n't you say ? Even for a suicide message . What is this note really , Darrow ? When did your wife write it ? Why did she ? Where did you find it ? " There was no reply . Wordlessly , Darrow continued washing glasses . They clanked and scraped angrily against the metal pan . " On the night she died , you left the pub . Why ? " " I went looking for her . I 'd been up to the flat , found that "  --  Darrow 's sharp nod indicated the note  --  " in the kitchen , went out to find her . " " Where ? " " The village . " " Knocking on doors ? Looking in sheds ? Searching through houses ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in someone 's house now , was she ? " " And you knew for a certainty that she was going to kill her-self ? " " It bloody well says that ! " " Indeed . Where did you look for her ? " " Here and there . I do n't remember . It 's fifteen years past . I did n't heed it at the time . And it 's buried now . Am I clear on that , man ? It 's buried . " " It was buried , " Lynley acknowledged . " Quite successfully so , I should guess . But then Joy Sinclair came here and began an exhumation . And it looks very much as if someone was afraid of that . Why did she telephone you so many times , Darrow ? What did she want ? " Darrow swung both arms up from the dishwater . Irately , he slammed them onto the bar . " I 've told you ! The bitch wanted to talk about Hannah , but I was having none of it . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives . We 're over it . God damn you , we 're going to stay that way . Now , get out of here or make a fucking arrest . " Regarding the other man calmly , Lynley made no reply , so the implication behind Darrow 's last statement grew with every moment . His face began to mottle . The veins in his arms seemed to swell . " An arrest , " Lynley repeated . " Odd that you should suggest that , Mr. Darrow . Why on earth should I want to make an arrest for ap199suicide ? Except we both know , do n't we , that this was n't a suicide . And I believe that Joy Sinclair 's mistake was telling you that it did n't much look like a suicide to her . " " Get out ! " Darrow roared . Lynley took his time about gathering the materials back into the folder . " We 'll be back , " he said pleasantly . BY FOUR O'CLOCK that afternoon , the company assembled at the Agincourt Theatre had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a playwright for the theatre 's opening production : TennesseeWilliams , a revival piece . The play itself was still open to discussion . From the back of the auditorium , St. James observed the group on the stage . They had narrowed the field down to the relative merits of three possibilities , and from what St. James could tell , things were swinging in Joanna Ellacourt 's direction . She was arguingstrongly against A Streetcar Named Desire , her aversion to it rising , it seemed , out of a quick calculation of how much stage time Irene Sinclair would have if , however incongruously , she played Stella . There appeared to be no doubt at all as to the casting of Blanche Dubois . Lord Stinhurst had been displaying a remarkable degree of patiencefor the quarter hour that St. James had been watching . In an unusual display of magnanimity , he had allowed all the players , the designers , the director , and the assistants to have their say about the crisis facing the company and the pressing need to get into productionas soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneading his fingers into the small of his back . " You 'll have my decision tomorrow , " he told them . " We 've been together long enough for now . Let 's meet again in the morning . At half past nine . Be ready to read . " " No hints for us , Stuart ? " Joanna Ellacourt asked , stretching languorously and leaning back in her chair so that her hair fell like a shimmering gold veil in the light . Next to her , Robert Gabriel affectionately ran three fingers down its length . " None at all , I 'm afraid , " Lord Stinhurst replied . " I 've not quite made up my mind . " Joanna smiled up at him , moving her shoulder to disengage Gabriel 's hand from her hair . " Tell me what I can do to persuade you to decide in my favour , darling . "  |p200Gabriel  gave a low , guttural laugh . " Take her up on it , Stuart . God knows our darling Jo excels at persuading . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fully laced though it was with innuendo . No one even moved at first , save for David Sydeham , who raised his head slowly from the script he was examining and levelled his eyes on the other man . His face was deadly , rife with hostility , but Gabriel did not seem the least affected . Rhys Davies-Jones threw down his own script . " Christ , you 're an ass , " he said to Gabriel wearily . " And I once thought Rhys and I would never agree upon anything , " Joanna added . Irene Sinclair moved her chair back from the table . Harshly , it abraded the stage floor . " Right . Well . I 'll be off . " She spoke agreeably enough before making her exit down the main aisle of the theatre . But when she passed St. James , he saw how she was working to control her face , and he wondered how and why she had ever endured a marriage to Robert Gabriel : While the other players , the assistants , and the designers began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet and went to the front of the auditorium . It was not overlarge , perhaps seating only five hundred people , and a grey haze of stale cigarette smoke hung over its open thrust stage . He mounted the steps . " Have you a moment , Lord Stinhurst ? " Stinhurst was having a low-voiced conversation with a spindly young man who carried a clipboard and wrote with knotted concentration . " See to it that we 've enough copies for tomorrow 's readthrough , " he said in conclusion . Only then did he look up . " So you lied to them about not having your mind made up , " St. James observed . Stinhurst did n't reply to this at once . Rather , he called out , " We 've no need for all this light now , Donald , " and in answer the stage leaped with cavernous shadows . Only the table itself was illuminated . Stinhurst sat down at it , took out pipe and tobacco , and laid them both down . " Sometimes it 's easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's one of the behaviours a producer grows adept at over time . If you 've ever been in the midst of a tug-of-war of creative egos , you 'd know what I mean . " " This seems to be a particularly inflammable group . " " It 's understandable . They 've been through a bit of hell these past three days . " Stinhurst packed his pipe . His shoulders were stiff ,  |p201a  marked contrast to the weariness of his voice and face . " I do n't imagine this is a social call , Mr. St. James . " St. James handed him the stack of enlargements which Deborah had made from the photograph taken at Geoffrey Rintoul 's inquest . On each new photograph appeared a single face and occasionally part of a torso , but nothing else . There was nothing to indicate that the people had once all been part of one group . Deborah had been particularly careful about that . " Will you identify these people for me ? " St. James asked . Stinhurst fingered through the lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James could see the marked hesitation in his movements , and he wondered if the man would actually cooperate . Stinhurst was no doubt well aware of the fact that he was not obliged to reveal a thing . Nonetheless , he also appeared to know exactly how a refusal to respond would be interpreted by Lynley if he learned of it . So St. James only hoped that Stinhurst believed he was here in some official capacity at Lynley 's behest . After a thorough perusal , the man laid all the photographs out in a line and indicated each as he spoke . " My father . My sister 's husband , Phillip Gerrard . My sister , Francesca . My wife , Marguerite . My father 's solicitor  --  he died some years ago and I ca n't remember his name at the moment . Our physician . Myself . " Stinhurst had omitted the very man whose identity they needed . St. James pointed to the photograph he had laid next to that of his sister . " And this man in profile ? " Stinhurst 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't say I 've ever seen him before . " " Odd , " St. James said . " Why ? " " Because in the original photo from which all of these were taken , he 's talking to you . And for some reason you look in that picture as if you know him quite well . " " Indeed . I may have at the time . But my brother 's inquest was twenty-five years ago . And at this distance , I do n't think I can be expected to remember everyone who was there . " " That 's true , " St. James replied and considered the fascinating fact that he had not mentioned that the photographs were from Geoffrey Rintoul 's inquest at all . Stinhurst was getting to his feet . " If there 's nothing else , Mr. St. James , I 've things to see to before my day ends here . " He did not look at the photographs again as he spoke , gatheringp202pipe and tobacco , readying himself to leave . And that was so unlikelya human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his eyes from them lest his face reveal more than he had been willing to say . One thing was a certainty , St. James concluded . Lord Stinhurst knew exactly who the man in the photograph was . CERTAIN KINDS of lighting refuse to lie about the relentless , ineluctableprocess of ageing . They are entirely unforgiving , capable of exposing flaws and baring the truth . Direct sunlight , the harsh overhead fluorescent lights of a business establishment , the flood lights used to film without soft-focus filters  --  these are proficient at doing their worst . In her dressing room , Joanna Ellacourt 's make-up table appeared to have this sort of lighting as well . At least it did today . The air was quite cool , the way she always liked it in order to keep the flowers fresh when they arrived from a score of admirers before her performances . There were-no flowers now . Instead , the air held that combination of odours peculiar to every dressing room she had ever inhabited , the mingling scents of cold cream , astringent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of this scent as she stared unflinchingly at her reflection and forced her eyes to rest upon each telling harbinger of approaching middle age : the incipient wrinkles from nose to chin ; the delicate webbing round her eyes ; the first ringed indentations on her neck , prelude to the old-age cording that could never be disguised . She smiled in self-mockery at the thought that she had escaped nearly everything that had constituted the psychological quicksand of her life . Her family 's grubby five-room council house in Nottingham ; the sight of her father sitting daily in unshaven gloom at his window , a machinist on the dole whose dreams had died ; the sound of her mother whining about the cold that persistently seeped through the poorly sealed windows , or the black and white telly whose knobs were broken off so that the sound remained at a constant nerve-shattering pitch ; the future that each of her sisters had chosen , one that repeated the history of their parents ' marriage , an endless , bone-grinding repetition of producing babies at intervals of eighteen months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped all that . But she could not escape that process of slow decomposition that awaits every man . Like so many egocentric creatures whose beauty dominates the stage and the screen and the covers of countless magazines , she hadp203thought for a time that she might elude it . She had , in fact , grown to believe that she would . For David had always allowed her to do so . Her husband had been more than her liberation from the miseriesof Nottingham . David had been the one true constant in a fickle world in which fame is ephemeral , in which the critics ' apotheosis of a new talent could mean the ruin of an established actress who has given her life to the stage . David knew all about that , knew how it frightened her , and through his continual support and love  --  in spite of her tantrums , her demands , her flirtations  --  he had assuaged her fears . Until Joy Sinclair 's play had come along , changing everythingirrevocably between them . Fixing her eyes on her reflection without really seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No longer the fire that had consumed her with such irrational , revenge-seeking intensity on Saturday night at Westerbrae , it had burned itself down to a glowing pilot , capable of igniting her central passion at the least provocation . David had betrayed her . She forced herself to think of it again and again , lest the decades of their shared intimacy insinuate themselves into her consciousness and demand that she forgive him . She would never do so . He had known how much she had depended upon Othello being the last time she performed with Robert Gabriel . He had known how much she despised Gabriel 's pursuit of her , flavoured with accidental encounters , casually inadvertent movements that grazed his hand across the very tips of her breasts , longing stage kisses in front of enormous audiences who grew to believe it was part of the show , private double-edged compliments attached to references to his sexual prowess . " Like it or not , you and Gabriel have magic when you 're on the stage together , " David had said . Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had always wondered why . Until now . He had lied to her about Joy Sinclair 's play , telling her that Robert Gabriel 's participation was Stinhurst 's idea , telling her that Gabriel could n't possibly be dropped from the cast . But she knew the real truth although she could n't bear to face what it implied . To insist upon Gabriel 's being sacked would mean a decrease in revenuesfor the show itself , which would cut into her percentage  --  into David 's percentage . And David liked his money . His Lobb shoes , his Rolls , his home on Regent 's Park , his cottage in the country , his Savile Row wardrobe . If all this could he maintained , what did itp204matter that his wife would have to fight off Robert Gabriel 's sweaty advances for another year or so ? She 'd been doing it for more than a decade , after all . When her dressing-room door opened , Joanna did n't bother to turn from the make-up table , for the mirror provided a more than adequate view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , she knew who was entering . After all , she 'd had twenty years of hearing them to recognise any one of her husband 's movements  --  his steady footsteps , the rasp of a match when he lit a cigarette , the rustle of cloth against his skin when he dressed , the slow relaxation of his muscles when he lay down to sleep . She could identify any and all of them ; in the end they were so uniquely David . But she was beyond considering any of that now . So she reached for hairbrush and hairpins , pushed her make-up case to one side , and began to see to her hair , counting the strokes from one to one hundred as if each took her further away from the long stretch of history she shared with David Sydeham . He did n't speak when he entered the room . He merely walked to the chaise as he always did . But this time he did not sit . Nor did he speak until she finally finished with her hair , dropped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him expressionlessly . " I suppose I can rest a bit more easily if I simply know why you did it , " he said . LADY HELEN arrived at the St. James home shortly before six that evening . She felt both discouraged and disheartened . Even a tray in St. James ' study , burdened with fresh scones , cream , tea , and sandwiches , did little to brighten her . " You look as if you could do with a sherry , " St. James observed once she had removed her coat and gloves . Lady Helen dug through her handbag for her notebook . " That sounds exactly what I need , " she agreed heavily . " No luck ? " Deborah asked . She was sitting on the ottoman tothe right of the hearth , sneaking an occasional bit of scone down toPeach , the scruffy little dachshund who waited patiently at her feet , occasionally testing the flavour of her ankle with a delicate andloving pink tongue . Nearby , the grey cat Alaska was curled happilyonto a pile of papers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , he did not otherwise stir at Lady Helen 's entrance . " It 's not exactly that , " she replied , gratefully accepting the glassp205of sherry which St. James brought her . " I 've the information we want . It 's only that ... " " It does n't go far to helping Rhys , " St. James guessed . She shot him a smile that she knew was at best only tremulous . His words pained her unaccountably , and feeling the force of a sudden wretchedness , she realised how she had been depending upon her interview with Lord Stinhurst 's secretary to attenuate everyone 's suspicion of Rhys . " No , it does n't help Rhys . It does n't do much of anything , I 'm afraid . " " Tell us , " St. James said . There was , after all , so little to tell . Lord Stinhurst 's secretary had been willing enough to talk about the telephone calls she had placed for her employer , once she realised how essential those calls might be in exonerating him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she had spoken openly to Lady Helen , going so far as to produce the notebook into which she had jotted down the message that Stinhurst had wished her to repeat for every call she made . It was straightforward enough . " Am unavoidably delayed in Scotland due to an accident . Will be in touch the moment I 'm available . " Only one call differed from that repeated message , and although it was decidedly odd , it did not seem to wear the guise of guilt . " Resurfacing forces me to put you off a second time this month . Terribly sorry . Telephone me at Westerbrae if this presents a prob-lem . " " Resurfacing ? " St. James repeated . " Odd choice of words . Are you certain about that , Helen ? " " Completely . Stinhurst 's secretary had written it down . " " Some theatre term ? " Deborah suggested . St. James eased himself awkwardly into the chair near her . She moved on the ottoman to give him room for his leg . " Who received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . " Sir Kenneth Willingate . " " A friend ? A colleague ? " " I 'm not altogether sure . " Lady Helen hesitated , trying to decide how to present her last piece of information in such a way that St. James would be drawn into its singularity . She knew how flimsy a detail it was , knew also how she was clinging to it in the hope that it would take them in any direction other than towards Rhys . " I 'm probably grasping at straws , Simon , " she continued ingenuously . " But there was one thing about that last call . All the others had been made to cancel appointments that Stinhurst had over the next few days . His secretary merely read the names to me right out of hisp206engagement book . But that last call to Willingate had nothing to do with his engagement book at all . The name was n't even written there . So it was either an appointment that Stinhurst had arranged on his own without telling his secretary ... " " Or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deborah finished for her . " There 's only one way we 're going to know , " St. James remarked . " And that 's to bully the information from Stinhurst . Or to track down Willingate ourselves . But we ca n't go any further without involving Tommy , I 'm afraid . We 're going to have to give him what little information we have and let him take it from there . " " But Tommy wo n't take it up ! You know that ! " Lady Helen protested . " He 's looking for a tie to Rhys . He 's going to dog whatever facts he believes will allow him to make an arrest . Nothing else matters to Tommy right now ! Or was n't this past weekend enough of a demonstration for you ? Apart from that , if you involve him , he 's bound to discover that Barbara 's gone her own way on the case ... with our help , Simon . You ca n't do that to her . " St. James sighed . " Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't protect them both . It 's going to come down to a decision . Do you take the chance of sacrificing Barbara Havers ? Or do you sacrifice Rhys ? " " I sacrifice neither . " He shook his head . " I know how you feel , but I 'm afraid that wo n't wash . " WHEN COTTER showed Barbara Havers into the study , she sensed the tension at once . The room felt alive with it . An abrupt silence , followed by a quick burst of welcoming conversation , revealed the discomfort that the three others were feeling . The atmosphere among them was charged and taut . " What is it ? " she asked . They were , she had to admit , nothing if not an honest group . " Simon feels we ca n't go further without Tommy . " Lady Helen went on to explain the peculiar telephone message that Stinhurst had sent to Sir Kenneth Willingate . " We have no authority to pop into these people 's lives and question them , Barbara , " St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know they do n't have an obligation to talk to us . So unless Tommy takes it on , I 'm afraid we 've met with a dead end . " Barbara reflected on this . She knew quite well that Lynley hadp207no intention of turning away from the East Anglian lead . It was too enticing . He would brush off an abstruse telephone message to an unknown Londoner named Willingate as a waste of his time . Especially , she thought with resignation , since Lord Stinhurst was the man who had sent it . The others were right . They 'd come to a dead end . But if she could n't persuade them to go on without Lynley , Stinhurst would get away cleanly , without a scratch . " Of course , we know that if Tommy discovers you 've taken part of the case in another direction without his authorisation ... " " I do n't care about that , " Barbara said brusquely , surprised to find that it was the perfect truth . " You may be suspended . Or sent back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't important right now . This is . I 've spent the whole filthy day chasing spectres in East Anglia without a hope of any of it coming to any good . But we 're onto something here , and I 've no intention of letting it die simply because someone might put me in uniform again . Or sack me . Or anything else . So if we have to tell him , we tell him . Everything . " She faced them squarely . " Shall we do it now ? " In spite of her decision , the others hesitated . " You do n't want to think about it ? " Lady Helen asked . " I do n't need to think about it , " Barbara replied . Her words were harsh , and she did n't temper them as she continued . " Look , I saw Gowan die . He 'd pulled a knife out of his back and crawled across the scullery floor , trying to get help . His skin looked like boiled meat . His nose was broken . His lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sixteen-year-old boy . And if it costs me my job to track the killer down , that 's a very minor cost as far as I 'm concerned . Who 's coming with me ? " Loud voices in the hallway precluded an answer . The door swung open and Jeremy Vinney pushed past Cotter . He was breathless , redfaced . His trouser legs were soaked up to his knees , and his ungloved hands looked raw from the cold . " Could n't get a taxi , " he panted . " Ended up running all the way from Sloane Square . Was afraid I might miss you . " He stripped off his coat and threw it down on the couch . " Found out who the fellow in the photograph was . Had to let you know at once . Name 's Willingate . " " Kenneth ? " " The same . " Vinney bent with his hands on his knees , trying to catch his breath . " Not all . Not who the bloke is that makes it so interesting . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Do n't know what he was in 1963 . But right now he 's the head of MI5. "  |p209THERE  WAS N'T a person in the room who did not understand the full range of implications behind Jeremy Vinney 's words . MI5 : Military Intelligence , section five . The **25;16914;TOOLONG of the British government . It was suddenly clear why Vinney had come bursting in upon them , certain of his welcome , completely assured that he bore information vital to the case . If he had been a suspect before , surely this new twist took him out of the running entirely . As if convinced of this , he went on . " There 's more . I was intrigued by our conversation this morning about the Profumo  --  Keeler case in 1963 , so I went through the morgue to see if there was any article alluding to a possible connectionbetween their situation and Geoffrey Rintoul 's death . I thought that perhaps Rintoul had been involved with a call girl and was trotting back to London to see her the night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like such ancient history , " Deborahremarked . " Surely that sort of scandal would n't affect a family'sreputation now . " Lady Helen agreed , but her comments were obviously reluctant . " There 's truth to that , Simon . Murder Joy . Destroy the scripts . Murder Gowan . All because Geoffrey Rintoul was seeing a call girltwenty-five years ago ? How can one argue that as a credible motive ? " " It depends on the level of importance attached to the man'sposition , " St. James replied . " Consider Profumo 's case as an example . He was secretary of state for war , carrying on a relationshipp210with Christine Keeler , a call girl who also just happened to be seeing a man called Yevgeni Ivanov . " " Who was attached to the Soviet embassy but was reportedly a Soviet intelligence agent , " Vinney added and smoothly continued . " In an interview with the police on an entirely different matter , Christine Keeler volunteered the information that she had been asked to discover from John Profumo the date on which certain atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ameri-cans . " " A lovely person , " Lady Helen commented . " This leaked to the press  --  as perhaps she intended  --  and things heated up for Profumo . " " And for the government as well , " Havers said . Vinney nodded his agreement . " The Labour party demanded that Profumo 's relationship with Keeler be debated before the House of Commons while the Liberal party demanded the prime minister 's resignation because of it . " " Why ? " Deborah asked . " They claimed that as head of security services , the prime minister was either aware of all the facts on Profumo 's relationship with the call girl and was hiding them or he was guilty of incompetenceand neglect . However , " Vinney finished , " the truth well might be that the prime minister merely felt he could not survive another serious case involving the resignation of one of his ministers , as would likely occur if Profumo 's behaviour was examined closely . So he gambled that nothing against Profumo would come out . If the Profumo affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are the prime minister would have to resign . " " Vassal ? " Lady Helen 's body tensed . White-faced , she leaned forward in her chair . Vinney looked at her , clearly perplexed by her reaction to his words . " William Vassall . He was sentenced to prison in October of sixty-two . He was an Admiralty clerk who was spying for the Soviets . " " My God . My God ! " Lady Helen cried . She got to her feet , spun to St. James . " Simon ! It 's the line from the play that all the Rintouls reacted to . ' Another Vassall . ' The character was running off with no time to return to London . He said he would n't become another Vassall . And they knew what it meant when they heard it . They knew ! Francesca , Elizabeth , Lord and Lady Stinhurst ! All of them knew ! This was no call-girl relationship ! It was nothing of the sort ! "  |p211St  . James was already pushing himself out of his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " On what ? " Deborah cried . " On Geoffrey Rintoul , my love . Another Vassall . It seems that Geoffrey Rintoul was a Soviet mole . And God help them , but every member of his family and a good part of the government appeared to know it . " LYNLEY HAD left the doors open between his dining and drawing rooms , largely so that he could hear the music from his stereo while he was eating dinner . For the past few days , food had held little attraction for him . Tonight was no different . Because of this , he pushed most of his lamb aside uneaten and instead gave himself over to the passion of a Beethoven symphony that swelled from the next room . He moved away from the table and leaned back in his chair with his legs stretched out before him . In the last twenty-four hours , he had avoided thinking about what the case he was building against Rhys Davies-Jones was going to do to Helen Clyde . Steadfastly forcing himself to keep moving forward from fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind entirely . But she intruded now . He understood her unwillingness to believe in Davies-Jones ' guilt . She was , after all , involved with the man . But how would she react when she was faced with the knowledge  --  irrefutable and supported by a score of facts  --  that she had been cold-bloodedly used to facilitate a murder ? And how could he possibly protect her from the devastation that knowledge was going to cause in her life ? In thinking about this , Lynley found that he could no longer avoid looking directly at the truth of how damnably much he missed Helen and how irrevocably he might lose her if he continued his pursuit of Davies-Jones to its logical conclusion . " My lord ? " His valet was standing hesitantly in the doorway , rubbing the top of his left shoe against the back of his right leg as if in the need to make adjustments to his already immaculate appearance . He ran a hand over the top of his perfectly groomed hair . Beau Brummel of Eaton Terrace , Lynley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it appeared that the young man might go on with his grooming indefinitely . " Lady Helen Clyde 's just in the ante , my lord . With Mr. St. James and Sergeant Havers . " Denton 's expression was a model of nonchalance , something he no doubt considered suitable to thep212occasion . However , his tone conveyed some considerable surprise , and Lynley wondered how much Denton already knew  --  in that omniscient way of servants  --  about his rift with Lady Helen . He had , after all , been seeing Lady Helen 's Caroline rather seriously for the past three years . " Well , do n't leave them standing in the hall , " Lynley said . " The drawing room , then ? " Denton enquired solicitously . Much too solicitously for Lynley 's liking . He rose with a nod , irritably thinking , I hardly expect they want to see me in the kitchen . The three of them were standing in a fairly tight knot at one end of the room when he joined them a moment later . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under the cover of the music , they were speaking to one another in hushed , urgent voices . But his entrance brought their conversation to an end . And then , as if his presence were a stimulus to do so , they began to shed their coats , hats , gloves , , and mufflers . The action had the appearance of buying a bit of time . Lynley turned off the stereo , replaced the album in its jacket , and faced them curiously . They seemed unnaturally subdued . " We 've come across some information that you need to have , Tommy , " St. James said , in very much the manner of a planned introduction . " What sort of information ? " " It concerns Lord Stinhurst . " Lynley 's eyes went at once to Sergeant Havers . She met them unflinchingly . " Are you part of this , Havers ? " " Yes , I am . Sir . " " It 's my doing , Tommy , " St. James said before Lynley could speak again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she showed it to me . It seemed worth looking into . " Lynley maintained his calm with an effort . " Why ? " " Because of Phillip Gerrard 's will , " Lady Helen said impulsively . " Francesca 's husband . He said he would n't allow himself to be buried on the grounds of Westerbrae . Because of the telephone calls Lord Stinhurst placed on the morning of the murder . They were n't only to cancel his appointments , Tommy . Because  --  " Lynley looked at St. James , feeling the blow of treachery strike him from the single most unexpected quarter . " My God . You 've told them about my conversation with Stinhurst. "  |p213St  . James had the grace to drop his eyes . " I 'm sorry . Truly . I felt I had no choice . " " No choice , " Lynley repeated incredulously . Lady Helen took a hesitant step towards him , her hand extended . " Please , Tommy . I know how you must feel . As if we 're all against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . Listen . " Compassion from Helen was just about the last thing Lynley could bear at the moment . He struck out at her cruelly , without a thought . " I think we 're all perfectly clear on where your interests lie , Helen . You can hardly be the most objective assessor of truth , considering your involvement in this case . " Lady Helen 's hand fell . Her face was stricken with pain . St. James spoke , his voice cold with quick anger . " Nor can you , Tommy , if the truth be faced among us . " He let a moment pass . Then he went on in a different tone , but as implacably as before . " Lord Stinhurst lied to you about his brother and his wife . First and last . A good possibility is that Scotland Yard knew he planned to do so and sanctioned it . The Yard chose you deliberately to handle this case because you were the most likely person to believe whatever Stinhursttold you . His brother and his wife never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the facts , or shall we be on our way ? " Lynley felt as if ice were melting into his bones . " What in God 's name are you talking about ? " St. James moved towards a chair . " That 's what we 've come to tell you . But I think we all could do with a brandy . " WHILE ST . JAMES outlined the information they had gathered on Geoffrey Rintoul , Barbara Havers watched Lynley , gauging his reaction . She knew how resistant he would be to the facts , considering Rintoul 's privileged background and how closely it resembled Lynley'sown . Everything in Lynley 's upper-class constitution was going to act in concert , provoking him to disclaim each of their facts and conjectures . And the policewoman in Barbara knew exactly how insubstantial some of their facts were . The inescapable reality was that if Geoffrey Rintoul had indeed been a Soviet mole  --  working for years within that sensitive area of the Defence Ministry  --  the only way they would know for a certainty would be if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed access to an MI5 computer . Even a file on Geoffrey Rintoul marked inaccessible would verify that the man had been under some sort of investigation by the counterintelli/gence agency . But they had no access to such a computer and no source within MI5 who could validate their story . Even Scotland Yard 's Special Branch would be of no service to them if the Yard itself had sanctioned Lord Stinhurst 's fabrication about his brother 's death in Scotland in the first place . So it all came down to Lynley 's ability to see past his tangle of prejudices against Rhys Davies-Jones . It all came down to his ability to look the truth squarely in the face . And the truth was that Lord Stinhurst , not Davies-Jones , had the strongest possible motive for wanting Joy Sinclair dead . Provided with the keys to Joy 's room by his own sister , he had murdered the woman whose play  --  cleverly revised without his prior knowledge  --  had threatened to reveal his family 's darkest secret . " So when Stinhurst heard the name Vassal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was writing about , " St. James concluded . " And consider how Geoffrey Rintoul 's background supports his having been a spy for the Soviets , Tommy . He went to Cambridge in the thirties . We know that Soviet recruiting went on like the devil during that period . Rintoul read economics , which no doubt made him even more receptive to arguments in favour of the teachings of Marx . And then his behaviour during the war . Requesting reassignmentto the Balkans gave him contact with the Russians . I should n't be at all surprised to discover that his control was in the Balkans as well . No doubt that 's when he received his most important instructions : to work his way into the Ministry of Defence . God knows how much sensitive data he supplied the Soviets over the years . " No one said anything when St. James finished speaking . Their attention was on Lynley . They had taken their seats under the portrait of the seventh Earl of Asherton , and as they watched , Lynley lifted his eyes to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His expression was unreadable . " Tell me again what Stinhurst 's message was to Willingate , " he said at last . St. James leaned forward . " He said that resurfacing forced him to put Willingate off a second time this month . And to telephone Westerbrae if that presented a problem . " " Once we discovered exactly who Willingate is , the message began to make more sense , " Barbara continued . She felt a sense of urgency , a need to convince . " He seemed to be telling Willingate that the fact that Geoffrey Rintoul had been a mole had surfaced for the second time , the first time being on that New Year 's Eve of 1962 . So Willingate was to telephone Westerbrae to assist with a problem.  |p215The  problem being Joy Sinclair 's death and the script she was writing that exposed all the details of Geoffrey 's unsavoury past . " Lynley nodded . Barbara went on . " Of course , Lord Stinhurst could n't telephone Willingate himself , could he ? Any research into the Westerbrae telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed the one call to his secretary . She did the rest . And Willingate , understanding the message , did telephone him , sir . Twice , I should guess . Remember ? Mary Agnes told me she heard two calls come in . They had to be from Willingate . One to find out what in God 's name had happened . And the second to tell Stinhurst what he 'd managed to set up with Scotland Yard . " " Remember as well , " St. James said , " that according to Inspector Macaskin , Strathclyde CID never requested the Yard 's assistance in the case at all . They were merely informed that the Yard would take over . It seems likely that Willingate arranged all that , telephoning someone in high command at the Yard to set the investigation up and then getting back to Stinhurst with the details of who the investigating officer would be . No doubt Stinhurst was more than ready for your appearance on the scene , Tommy . And he had all day to plan out a story that you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had to be a personal story , one that , as a gentleman , you would be unlikely to repeat . What better choice than his wife 's allegedly illegitimate child ? It was insidiously clever . He simply did n't take into account that you would confide in me . Nor that I  --  not very much of a gentleman myself , I 'm afraid  --  would break your confidence . And I 'm sorry I did that . Had there been any other way , I 'd have said nothing . I hope you believe me . " St. James ' last remark bore the sound of conclusion . But after it , Lynley merely reached for the brandy . He poured himself more and passed the decanter on to St. James . His hands did not shake , his face did not change . Outside , a horn honked twice on Eaton Terrace . An answering shout rose from a house nearby . Feeling a rising need to force him into taking a position , Barbara spoke . " The question we were trying to answer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would involve themselves in a case like this now . And the answer seems to be that in 1963 they engaged in a cover-up of Rintoul 's activities  --  probably using the Official Secrets Act  --  in order to spare the prime minister the embarrassment of having a Soviet spy discovered in the high reaches of government so soon upon the heels of the Vassall situation and the Profumo scandal . Since Geoffrey Rintoul was dead , he could do the Defencep216Ministry no further damage . He could only be of damage to the prime minister himself if the news of his activities leaked . So they kept that from happening . And now , they 'd apparently prefer not to have that old cover-up exposed . I suppose it would be rather embarrassingfor them . Or maybe they 've debts to be paid to the Rintoul family and this is how they 're paying them . At any rate , they 've covered up again . Only . . . " Barbara paused , wondering how he would take the final bit of information , knowing only that in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could n't be the one to give him such pain . Lynley took the opportunity himself . " I was to do it for them , " he said hollowly . " And Webberly knew it . Right from the begin-ning . " In the devastation behind the words , Barbara recognised what Lynley was thinking  --  that this situation proved he was merely an expendable object to his superiors at the Met ; that his was not a career with either value or distinction , so that if it were destroyed by the exposure of his even unconscious attempt to cover up the trail of Stinhurst 's guilt in a murder investigation , there would be no real loss to anyone when he was dismissed . Never mind the fact that none of this was true . Barbara knew even a moment 's belief in it would corrosively erode his pride . In the past fifteen months , she had loved and hated and come to understand him . But never before had she perceived that his aristocraticbackground was a source of anguish to him , a burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unassuming dignity , even in the moments when he most longed to shrug it off . " How could Joy Sinclair have known all this ? " Lynley asked . His face was impeccably , painfully controlled . " Lord Stinhurst told you that himself . She was there the night Geoffrey died . " " And I did n't even notice that there was nothing about Joy 's play in her study . " Lynley 's voice was heavy with reproach . " Christ , what kind of police work is that ? " " The gentlemen from MI5 do n't leave calling cards when they 've searched a house , Tommy , " St. James said . " There was no evidence of a search . You could n't have known they had been there . And after all , you had n't gone looking for information about the play . " " All the same , I should n't have been blind to its absence . " He smiled grimly at Barbara . " Good work , Sergeant . I ca n't think where we 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's praise brought Barbara no joy . Never had she felt sop217completely wretched about having been in the right . " What shall we . . . ? " She hesitated , unwilling to take any more authority from him . Lynley got to his feet . " We 'll go for Stinhurst in the morning , " he said . " I should like the rest of the night to think about what needs to be done . " Barbara knew what he really meant : to think about what he himself was going to do , faced with the knowledge of how Scotland Yard had used him . She wanted to say something to lighten the blow . She wanted to say that in spite of the plan to make him instrumental in a cover-up , it had n't come off ; they had proved themselves superior to it . But she knew that he would see through the words to the truth beneath them . She had proved herself superior to it . She had saved him from his own black folly . With nothing more to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gloves , adjusting hats and mufflers . The atmosphere was fraught with words needing to be spoken . Lynley took his time about replacing the brandy decanter , gathering the small crystal balloon glasses onto a tray , turning out the lights in the room . He followed them into the hall . Lady Helen was standing in a pool of light near the door . She had said nothing for an hour , and now she spoke tentatively as he came to join them . " Tommy ... " " Meet me at the theatre at nine , Sergeant , " Lynley said abruptly . " Have a constable with you to take Stinhurst in . " If she had not already realised how inconsequential her triumph really was in this game of detection , that brief exchange would have illustrated the point for Barbara with rare lucidity . She saw the gulf widen between Lynley and Lady Helen , felt its painful impassability like a physical wound . She said only , " Yes , sir , " and reached for the door . " Tommy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted . Lynley looked at her then for the first time since St. James had begun speaking in the drawing room . " I was wrong about him , Helen . But you need to know the worst of my sin . I wanted to be right . " He nodded good night and left them . WEDNESDAY DAWNED under a leaden sky , the coldest day yet . The snow along the pavement had developed a hard , thin crust , grimy from soot and the exhaust of the city traffic.  |p218When  Lynley pulled up in front of the Agincourt Theatre at eight forty-five , Sergeant Havers was already waiting in front of it , bundled up to her eyebrows in her usual unbecoming brown wool , with a young police constable at her side . Lynley noted grimly that Havers had put some considerable thought into her selection of a constable , choosing the one least likely to be cowed by Stinhurst 's title and wealth : Winston Nkata . Once a mainstay of the Brixton Warriors  --  one of the city 's most violent black gangs  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three hard-nosed officers in A7 Branch , was now an aspirant to the highest reaches of CID . Living proof , he liked to say , that if they ca n't arrest you , they 'll damn well convert you . He flashed Lynley one of his high-voltage smiles . " ' Spector , " he called , " why you never drive that baby in my neighbourhood ? We like to burn pieces that nice . " " The next riot , let me know , " Lynley responded drily . " Next riot , we send out invitations , man . Make sure everybody have a chance to be there . " " Ah . Yes . Bring your own brick . " The black man threw back his head and laughed unrestrainedly as Lynley joined them on the pavement . " I like you , ' Spector , " he said . " Give me your home address . I think I got to marry your sister . " Lynley smiled . " You 're too good for her , Nkata . Not to mention about sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , I 'm sure we can come to a suitable arrangement . " He looked at Havers . " Has Stinhurst arrived yet ? " She nodded . " Ten minutes ago . " In answer to his unasked question , she replied , " He did n't see us . We were having coffee across the way . He had his wife with him , Inspector . " " That , " Lynley said , " is a stroke of luck . Let 's go in . " Inside , the theatre buzzed with the activity attendant to a new production . The auditorium doors were open ; conversation and laughter mixed with the noise of a crew at work , taking measurementsfor a set . Production assistants hurried by with clipboards in their hands and pencils behind their ears . In a corner by the bar , a publicist and a designer held a huddle over a large sheet of paper onto which the latter was sketching advertising draughts . It was altogether a place of creativity , humming with excitement , but this morning Lynley did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of bringing all these people 's pleasure to an end . As would be the case once Stinhurst faced arrest.  |p219They  were walking towards the door to the production offices at the far side of the building when Lord Stinhurst came out of it , followed by his wife . Lady Stinhurst was speaking in an agitated rush , twisting a large diamond ring on her finger . She stopped everything  --  ring-twisting , speaking , walking  --  when she saw the police . Stinhurst was cooperative enough when Lynley requested a privateplace to talk . " Come into my office , " he said . " Shall my wife . . . " He hesitated meaningfully . Lynley , however , had already decided exactly how Lady Stinhurst'spresence could be turned to his advantage . Part of him  --  the better part , he thought  --  wanted to let her go in peace , and shrank from making her a chessman in the game of fact and fiction . But the other part of him needed her as a tool of blackmail . And he hated that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd like Lady Stinhurst there as well , " he said briefly . With Constable Nkata posted outside the door and instructions to Stinhurst 's secretary to put no calls through that were not for the police , Lynley and Havers joined Lord Stinhurst and his wife in the producer 's office . It was a room much like the man himself , coldly decorated in black and grey , fitted out with a compulsively neat hardwood desk and luxuriously upholstered wingback chairs , the air holding an almost imperceptible odour of pipe tobacco . The walls were hung with tastefully framed posters of former Stinhurst productions , proclamations of over thirty years of success : Henry V London ; The Three Sisters , Norwich ; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , Keswick ; A Doll 's House , London ; Private Lives , Exeter ; Equus , Brighton ; Amadeus , London . At one side of the room were grouped a conference table and chairs . Lynley directed them towards these , unwilling to allow Stinhurst the comfort and command of facing the police across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her notebook , Lynley took out the photographs of the inquest as well as the enlargements which Deborah St. James had made . He laid them out on the table wordlessly . If everything St. James had said was true , Stinhurst had no doubt telephoned Sir Kenneth Willingate yesterday afternoon . He would he well fortified for this coming interview . Through a long , sleepless night Lynley had carefully reviewed the various ways he might head off another well-crafted set of lies . He had come to the realisation that Stinhurst did have at least one Achilles ' heel . Lynley aimed his first remark in its direction . " Jeremy Vinney knows the entire story , Lord Stinhurst . I don'tp220know whether he 'll write it since for the moment he has no hard evidence to back it up . But I have no doubt that he intends to start looking for that evidence . " Lynley straightened the photographs with deliberate attention . " So you can tell me another lie . Or we can explore in detail the one you created for me this past weekend at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me point out to you that had you told me the truth about your brother in the first place , it would probably have gone no further than St. James , in whom I confided . But because you lied to me , and because that lie did n't fit in with your brother 's grave in Scotland , Sergeant Havers knows about Geoffrey , as does St. James , as does Lady Helen Clyde , as does Jeremy Vinney . As will everyone with access to my report at ScotlandYard once I file it . " Lynley saw Stinhurst 's eyes go to his wife . " So what 's it to be ? " he asked , relaxing into his chair . " Shall we talk about that summer thirty-six years ago when your brother Geoffrey was in Somerset and you travelled the country in the regionals and your wife  --  " " Enough , " Stinhurst said . He smiled icily . " Hoist with my own petard , Inspector ? Bravo . " Lady Stinhurst 's hands writhed in her lap . " Stuart , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question could not have come at a better time . Lynley waited for the man 's response . After a long and thoughtful perusal of the police , Stinhurst turned to his wife and began to speak . However , when he did so , it was to prove beyond a doubt that he was a master player in the game of disarmament and surprise . " I told him you and Geoffrey were lovers , " he said . " I claimed that Elizabeth was your child , and that Joy Sinclair 's play was about your affair . I told them that she had revised her play without my knowledge to revenge herself upon us for Alec 's death . God forgive me , at least that last part was true enough . I 'm sorry . " Lady Stinhurst sat in uncomprehending silence , her mouth contortingwith words that would not emerge . One side of her face seemed to collapse with the effort . Finally she managed , " Geoff ? You never thought that Geoffrey and I . . . oh my God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she cried out involuntarily and shrank from the gesture . He withdrew fractionally , leaving his hand lying on the table between them . The fingers curled , then tightened into the palm . " No , of course not . But I needed to tell them something . I needed ... I had to keep them away from Geoff . " " You needed to tell them . . . But he 's dead . " Her face trans/formed with growing revulsion as she took in the enormity of what her husband had done . " Geoff 's dead . And I 'm not . Stuart , I 'm not ! You made a whore out of me to protect a dead man ! You sacrificed me ! My God ! How could you have done that ? " Stinhurst shook his head . His words were laboured . " Not a dead man . Not dead at all . But alive and in this room . Forgive me if you can . I was a coward , first , last , and always . I was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've done nothing ! Stuart , for God 's sake . You did nothing that night ! How can you say  --  " " It is n't true . I could n't tell you . " " Tell me what ? Tell me now ! " Stinhurst stared long at his wife , as if he were trying to summon courage from an examination of her face . " I was the one who gave Geoff over to the government . All of you learned the worst about him on that New Year 's Eve . But I . . . God help me , I 'd known he was a Soviet agent since 1949 . " STINHURST HELD himself perfectly still as he spoke , perhaps in the belief that a single movement would cause the floodgates to open and the accumulated anguish of thirty-nine years to come pouring out . His voice was matter-of-fact , and although his eyes became increasingly red-rimmed , he shed no tears . Lynley found himself wondering if Stinhurst was even capable of weeping after so many years of deceit . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge . He made no secret of it , and frankly , I took it as a bit of a lark , something he would outgrow in time . And if he did n't , I thought what a laugh it would be to have the future Earl of Stinhurst committed to the workers ' struggle to change the tide of history . What I did n't know was that his proclivities had been duly noted , and that he had been seduced into espionage while he was still a student . " " Seduced ? " Lynley asked . " It is a process of seduction , " Stinhurst replied . " A combination of flattery and cajolery , making the student believe he plays an important role in the scheme of change . " " How did you come to know this ? " " I discovered it quite by chance , after the war when we were all in Somerset . It was the weekend my son Alec was horn . I 'd gone out looking for Geoff directly after I 'd seen Marguerite and the baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first and only time . Her face did not register a single response . " A son . I was so happy . I wanted Geoff to know . So I went out looking and found him in one of our boyhood haunts , an abandoned cottage in the Quantock Hills . Apparentlyhe 'd felt that Somerset was safe . " " He was meeting someone ? " Stinhurst nodded . " I probably would have thought it was only a farmer , but earlier that weekend I 'd seen Geoff working in the study on some government papers , the sort that are stamped confidential in garish letters across the front . I thought nothing of it at the time , just that he 'd brought work home . His briefcase was on the desk , and he was putting a document into a manila envelope . Not an estate envelope , nor a government one . I remember that distinctly . But I thought nothing of it until I came upon him in the cottage and saw him pass that same envelope to the man he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute sooner  --  a minute later  --  I might well have assumed his companion was indeed a Somerset farmer . But as it was , once I saw the envelope change hands , I guessed the worst . Of course , for a moment I tried to tell myself that it was all a coincidence , that the envelope could not possibly be the same one I had seen in the study . But if it was only an innocent exchange of information that I 'd witnessed  --  all legal and aboveboard  --  why arrange for it to take place in the Quantock Hills , in the middle of nowhere ? " " If you 'd discovered them , " Lady Stinhurst asked numbly , " why did n't they do . . . something to keep you from revealing what you knew ? " " They did n't know exactly what I 'd seen . And even if they had , I was safe . In spite of everything , Geoff would have drawn the line at the elimination of his own brother . He was , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down to it . " Lady Stinhurst looked away . " Do n't say that about yourself . " " It 's true , I 'm afraid . " " Did he admit to his activities ? " Lynley asked . " Once the other man was gone , I confronted him , " Stinhurst said . " He admitted to it . He was n't ashamed . He believed in the cause . And I . . . I do n't know what I believed in . All I knew was that he was my brother . I loved him . I always had . Even though I was revolted by what he was doing , I could n't bring myself to betray him . He would have known , you see , that I was the one to turn him in . So I did nothing . But it ate away at me for years . "  | " I should guess you finally saw your opportunity to take action in 1962 . " " The government prosecuted William Vassall in October ; they already had arrested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September . I thought that if Geoff 's activities were uncovered then , so many years after I had come to know about them , he could hardly think I was the one to give him over to the government . So I . . . in November I handed my facts to the authorities . And surveillance began . In my heart , I hoped  --  I prayed  --  that Geoff would discover he was being watched and make his escape to the Soviets . He almost did . " " What prevented him ? " At the question , Stinhurst 's clenched fist tightened . His hand shook with the pressure , knuckles and fingers white . In the outer office a telephone rang ; an infectious burst of laughter sounded . Sergeant Havers stopped writing , cast a questioning look towards Lynley . " What prevented him ? " Lynley repeated . " Tell them , Stuart , " Lady Stinhurst murmured . " Tell the truth . This once . At last . " Her husband rubbed at his eyelids . His skin looked grey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " STINHURST PACED the length of the room , his tall , lean figure like a rod save for his head , which was bent , his eyes on the floor . " It happened much the way Joy 's play depicted it the other night . There was a telephone call for Geoff , but my father and I came into the library without Geoff 's knowledge and overheard part of it , heard him say that someone would have to get to his flat for the code book or the whole network would be blown . Father began to question him . Geoff  --  he was always so eloquent , such a master of the language  --  was frantic to get away at once . There was hardly time for an inquisition . He was n't thinking straight , was n't answeringquestions consistently , so Father guessed the truth . It was n't really difficult after what we 'd both heard of the telephone conversation . When Father saw that the very worst was true , something simply snapped . To him , it was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire way of life . I think he was overcome in an instant with a need to obliterate . So ... " From across the room , Stinhurst examined the lovely posters that lined his office walls . " My father went after him . Ile was like a hear . And I . . . God , Ip224watched it all . Frozen . Useless . And every night since then , Thomas , I 've relived that moment when I heard Geoff 's neck crack like the branch of a tree . " " Was your sister 's husband , Phillip Gerrard , involved ? " Lynley asked . " Yes . He was n't in the library when Geoff 's call came through , but he and Francesca and Marguerite heard my father shouting and came running from upstairs . They burst into the room just a momentafter . . . it was done . Of course , Phillip immediately went for the phone , insisting that the authorities be sent for at once . But we ... the rest of us pressured him out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . Francesca became hysterical at the thought . Phillip was obdurate enough at first , but ultimately , against all of us , especially Francie , what could he do ? So he helped us take his  --  Geoffrey , the body  --  to where the road forks left to Hillview Farm and begins the descent right towards Kilparie village . We took only Geoff 's car , to leave one set of tyre prints . " He smiled in exquisite self-denigration . " We were careful about that sort of thing . There 's a tremendous declivity that begins at the fork , with two switchbacks , one right after the other like a snake . We started the engine , sent the car off with Geoff in the driver 's seat . The car built speed . At the first switchback it shot across the road , broke through the fence , made the drop to the second switchback below , and went over the embankment . It burst into flames . " He pulled out a white handkerchief  --  a perfectly laundered linen square  --  and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not sit . " Afterwards , we walked home . The road was almost entirely ice , so we did n't even leave footprints . There was never really a question of its not being an accident . " His fingers touched the photograph of his father , still lying where Lynley had placed it among the others on the table . " Then why did Sir Andrew Higgins come from London to identifythe body and testify at the inquest ? " " As insurance . Lest anyone notice anything peculiar about Geoff 's injuries that might cause questions to arise about our story . Sir Andrew was my father 's oldest friend . He could be trusted . " " And Willingate 's involvement ? " " He arrived at Westerbrae within two hours of the accident . He 'd been on his way to take Geoff back to London for questioning in the first place . A warning of his impending arrival was evidently the content of the telephone call my brother had received . Father told Willingate the truth . And a deal was struck between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it known that a mole had been in place for years in the Ministry of Defence now that the mole was dead . My father did n't want it known that his son had been the mole . Nor did he want to stand trial for murder . So the accident story stood . And the rest of us vowed silence . We kept it as well . But Phillip Gerrard was a decent man . The knowledge that he 'd allowed himself to be talked into covering up a murder consumedhim for the rest of his life . " " Is that why he 's not buried on Westerbrae land ? " " He felt he had cursed it . " " Why is your brother buried there ? " " Father would n't have his body in Somerset . It was all we could do to convince him to bury Geoff at all . " Stinhurst finally looked at his wife . " We all broke on the wheel of Geoffrey 's sedition , did n't we , Mag ? But you and I worst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost each other . " " It 's always been Geoff between us , then , " she said dully . " All these years . You 've always acted as if you killed him , not your father . There were even times when I wondered if you had . " Stinhurst shook his head , refusing to accept exoneration . " I did . Of course I did . In the library that night , there was a split second of decision when I could have gone to them , when I could have stopped Father . They were on the floor and ... Geoff looked at me . Maggie , I 'm the last person he saw . And the last thing he knew was that his only brother was going to stand there and do nothing and watch him die . I may as well have killed him myself , you see . I 'm responsible for it in the long run . " Treason , like the plague , doth take much in a blood . Lynley thought that Webster 's line had never seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Geoffrey Rintoul 's treachery had sprung the destruction of his entire family . And since the destructionwould not sicken , it continued to feed upon the other lives that touched on the periphery of the Rintouls ' : on Joy Sinclair 's and Gowan Kilbride 's . But now it would stop . There was just one more detail to be attended to . " Why did you involve MI5 this past weekend ? " " I did n't know what else to do . All I knew was that any investigationwould inevitably centre itself round the script we were reading the night Joy died . And I thought  --  I believed  --  that a close scrutiny of the script would reveal everything my family and the government had been so careful to keep hidden for twenty-five years . When Willingate phoned me , he agreed that the scripts had to hep226destroyed . Then he got in touch with your people in Special Branch and they in turn contacted a Met commissioner , who agreed to send someone  --  someone special  --  to Westerbrae . " Those last words brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against uselessly . He told himself that had it not been for Helen 's presence at Westerbrae and the crushing revelation about her relationship with Rhys Davies-Jones , he would have seen through the web of lies that Stinhurst had woven , he would have found Geoffrey Rintoul 's grave himself and drawn his own conclusions from it without the generous aid of his friends . At the moment , clinging to that belief was his only source of selfrespect . " I 'm going to ask you to make a complete statement at the Yard , " Lynley said to Stinhurst . " Of course , " he replied , and the denial that followed his acquiescencewas as mechanical as it was immediate . " I did n't kill Joy Sinclair . Thomas , I swear it . " " He did n't . " Lady Stinhurst 's tone was more resigned than urgent . Lynley did n't respond . She went on . " I would have known had he left our room that night , Inspector . " Lady Stinhurst could not have chosen a single rationale less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Havers . " Take Lord Stinhurst in for a preliminary statement , Sergeant . See that Lady Stinhurst goes home . " She nodded . " And you , Inspector ? " He thought about the question , about the time he still needed to come to terms with all that had happened . " I 'll be along directly . " ONCE LADY STINHURST 'S taxi was on its way to the family 's Holland Park home and Sergeant Havers and Constable Nkata had escorted Lord Stinhurst from the Agincourt Theatre , Lynley went back into the building . He did not relish the idea of an accidental meeting with Rhys Davies-Jones , and there was no doubt at all that the man was somewhere on the premises today . Yet something prompted Lynley to linger , perhaps as a form of expiation for the sins he had committed in suspecting Davies-Jones of murder , in doing everything in his power to encourage Helen to suspect him of murder as well . Governed by the force of passion rather than by reason , he had scrambled for facts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ignored those that wanted to lay the blame upon anyone else.  |p227All  this , he thought wryly , because I was so stupidly ignorant of what Helen meant in my life until it was too late . " You need n't try to comfort me . " It was a woman 's faltering voice , coming from the far side of the bar , just out of the range of Lynley 's vision . " I have n't come here on any but equal terms . You said , let 's talk truthfully . Well , let 's do ! Unsparingly , truthfully , even shamelessly , then ! " " Jo  --  " David Sydeham responded . " It 's no longer a secret that I love you . It never was . I loved you as long ago as the time I asked you to read the stone angel 's name with your fingers . Yes , it had begun that early , this affliction of love , and has never let go of me since . And that is my story  --  " " Joanna , shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have n't ! " Sydeham and Ellacourt 's words pounded their way into Lynley 's skull . He crossed the lobby , reached the bar , unceremoniously grabbed the script out of Sydeham 's hand , and without a word ran his eyes down the page to find Alma 's speech in Summer and Smoke . He did n't use his spectacles , so the words were blurred . But legible enough . And absolutely indelible . You need n't try to comfort me . I have n't come here on any but equal terms . You said , let 's talk truthfully . Well , let 's do ! Unsparingly , truthfully , even shamelessly , then ! It 's no longer a secret that I love you . It never was . I loved you as long ago as the time I asked you to read the stone angel 's name with your fingers . Yes , I remember the long afternoons of our childhood .. . And yet , for a moment , Lynley had assumed Joanna Ellacourt had been speaking for herself , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as young Constable Plater must have assumed when faced with Hannah Darrow 's suicide note fifteen years earlier in Porthill Green.
