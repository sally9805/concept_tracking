This story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts . This is part 1 . The spot opens with two old codgers sitting on a porch . In real life they are an Alfalfa , Ore. , beef and hog farmer named Dave Rufkahr and a loquacious northern California contractor and father of five , Dick Maugg . The pig farmer is talking . The normally talkative Maugg isn ' t . This is reel life , and in the next 30 seconds these two men will become Bartles and Jaymes . Roll the tape . Hello there . My name is Frank Bartles , and this is Ed Jaymes . You know , it occurred to Ed the other day that between his fruit orchard and my premium wine vineyard , we could make a truly superior , premium-grade wine cooler . It sounded good to me . So Ed took out a second mortgage on his house and wrote to Harvard for an MBA , and now we ' re preparing to enter the wine- cooler business . We will try to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much for your support . That was in October , 1985 , to promote the better-late-than-never entry of Ernest and Julio Gallo , the world ' s most prolific winemakers , into the already crowded wine-cooler business . Within a year of national introduction , the Gallo brothers ' two absolutely fictional hayseed counterparts propelled Bartles &; Jaymes Premium Wine Cooler from nowhere to first among the 40-plus brands on the market . They also provided the final oomph to loft Hal Patrick Riney onto the short list of advertising men  --  Leo Burnett , Bill Bernbach , J. Walter Thompson , David Ogilvy and maybe P.T. Barnum  --  and woman  --  Mary Wells  --  who are regarded by their colleagues in the industry as legends . " The reason he hasn ' t been the most famous advertising man in the country for the last 20 years is because he chose to stay in San Francisco and work on little regional accounts , " declares Dick Maugg/Ed Jaymes , who just happens to be Riney ' s best friend since grade school . " If he ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most famous adman in the country long before now . " In the two years and 56 episodes since Frank Bartles and Ed Jaymes began their bumbling exploration of the jargon and mystique of the business world , the ad campaign has defied nearly every rule . For one thing , the target audience for wine coolers is young urban whippersnappers , the likes of California Cooler ' s beach-blanket bimbos and of Bruce Willis of " Monlighting , " who struts his and Seagram ' s stuff . " Very predictable , " Riney sniffs . Industry sources credit the Willis ads for quadrupling Seagram ' s sales , but Riney credits Seagram ' s reported $35 million ad budget instead . In any case , the target audience for wine coolers is most definitely not aging rurals like Frank and Ed despite their yuppie worries about MBAs , balloon mortgage payments and market research . For example , Ed ' s own tests have discovered that their wine cooler tastes good with every food but kohlrabi , " a turniplike vegetable , " and candy corn . Defying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pure Hal Riney . One rule he has defied and one of the reasons he ' s won so many awards , he maintains , is that there are few ad executives his age and with his experience who still are writing their own ads . Riney has written every word to come out of Frank Bartles ' mouth . Another deviation is that Riney ' s own former four-pack-a-day voice  --  " a voice that can as easily pitch ice cream as elect a president , " proclaimed Adweek last June  --  is the voice for virtually every other Gallo product in addition to a dizzying list of other items , from Heileman brewing company ( although his agency now represents Anheuser-Busch ) to a hamburger chain called Carl ' s Jr . " These days in the voice biz , Hal Riney is solid gold . He has even become a buzzword , as in ' Get me a Hal Riney . ' The voice is good because it ' s plain , right down to a " slovenly speech pattern , " explained a Hollywood voicecasting agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the bathroom , " the head of a competing ad agency told San Francisco Magazine . In 1976 the agency he was working for in San Francisco offered Riney a promotion that would have taken him to New York . No sale . He quit instead and that year became a one-man , one-client ( Oregon ' s Blitz-Weinhard Brewing ) agency operating from his favorite San Francisco bar . That same year he was approached by David Ogilvy to head a northern California office for giant Ogilvy &; Mather . By last year , according to industry reports , Riney ' s little shop had gone from scratch to billing $125 million and netting $15 million annually ) and had become arguably the nation ' s most award-winning ad office . But as of last August , it was no longer part of Ogilvy &; Mather International . In a period of grand mergers of already large firms into increasingly huge mega-agencies ( O &; is now the even larger Ogilvy Group ) , Riney stunned the ad world by parting company with O &;  --  amicably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and rapidly expanding the business in direct competition with his former head office . Hal Riney &; Partners Inc. opened a Chicago office just last year ; others are in various stages of birth . The split from O &; came after Riney ' s brief fling in 1985 as head of a partially owned , supposedly independent subsidiary created to give him room to grow and compete . It wasn ' t room enough . One industry report quoted a " high-level insider " as saying : " We weren ' t totally devastated to see him go . Hal ' s not the easiest person in the world to work with . He tends to want to do it his way or not at all . " On the wall of his brightly lit , windowless office in a converted warehouse is a framed telegram from David Ogilvy himself commenting on the 1985 spinoff : " I see in the press that you have organized a contest to name your new agency . Why not Riney and Ogilvy ? That would couple the two best talents in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already on record as saying that his protege " is better than I ever was at my best . " ) As if to underscore that present-and-past notion , a huge blow-up of Riney as a lad of 5 or 6 hangs on the wall of the reception area on the executive floor of Hal Riney &; Partners ' sleek offices next to an equal-sized blow-up of a smiling and grandfatherly Ogilvy in shirtsleeves and suspenders . But Riney just grins and turns on a twinkle that would do a Santa proud when asked if the pictures are meant to be a subtle statement about his young fast- growing agency ' s relationship to that of the older and now virtually retired master . " Nah , " he says . " David just has this thing about suspenders , and that ' s the only picture of me we could find in suspenders . " He similarly downplays his role in the success of the Bartles &; Jaymes campaign that has made him famous . Grinning , eyes twinkling , with a modest little dip of his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t much on his part , ma ' am , ' cause the stuff tastes pretty good . There ' s a pause , he makes eye contact again and drawls , " Well , at least it wins all those critics ' taste tests . " A former colleague , who is no fan , calls this characteristic delivery " very aggressive self-effacement . " It ' s also part of an ongoing , very successful strategy to position Gallo products as the critics ' choices in their price ranges . In other words , if you buy Hal Riney ' s aw-shucks- I ' m-just-a-country- boy act , beware of 30-second spots touting Brooklyn Bridges that have the unmistakable Riney stamp . A joyful new bride rushing into the outstretched arms of her parents is a key ingredient in one beautifully orchestrated Gallo wine ad that ends with Riney ' s gravelly voice saying : " Only the best . From Ernest and Julio Gallo . " But versions of the soft , backlighted scene have been staples of Riney ads since the late ' 60s . He once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines for California ' s Crocker Bank . The resulting ad , and Paul Williams ' winning song " We ' ve Only Just Begun , " was so successful the bank had to cancel it . It brought in too many just-beginning young couples ; they had too little money to bank to make their business worthwhile for Crocker . Old men and little children are another giveaway . " The average age of someone with a balloon was 43 , " intones the down-home Riney voice over a Norman Rockwell image of a balloon-toting grandpa and a toddler who are both eating Edy ' s ice cream . Contrast this to Clara Peller ' s " Where ' s the beef ? ! " , the Wendy ' s ad that made Chicago ' s Joe Sedelmaier the hot name in advertising a few years back . Riney ' s is a warm fuzzy world ; Sedelmaier ' s was a hostile place fraught with anxiety . Riney will use actors , but he ' s famous for casting real people and for the lengths he ' ll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeyed to an Eskimo village some 30 miles from the Arctic Circle . " If we ' d gone to Hollywood to cast , we ' d have wound up with Japanese or Tongans , " he explains . Ironically , he and his film crew had to journey that far because alcoholism is such a problem among the Eskimos that no village had the pristine look the ad required . They finally resorted to a village that bans all booze . Farmer Rufkahr/Bartles was selected after screening photos and videos of nearly 900 farmers , cowboys and lumberjacks . " Liz knows every Oregon cowboy in a 4 , 000- mile radius , " Riney boasts of his casting director of eight years and wife of four , Liz Kennedy . ( Dick Maugg then won the Ed Jaymes job because Riney thinks " people seem to find humor when a fat person and a thin person are paired . " ) Riney insists he hates what the rest of the industry calls " slice of life " scenarios wherein people stand around talking about laundry bleach and bowl cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some familiar chord . The " CBS Morning News , " the Wall Street Journal and countless other news organizations noted an ad , aired last Christmas , for Andre champagne that showed two hapless party guests attacking ossified slices of fruitcake . When one comments on the unusual flavor , the not-to-be- denied hostess says : " Beef bouillon . Aunt Gladys says that ' s the way they used to make them in England . " Next shot : the product and a sympathetic voice , this time not Riney ' s , " What would the holidays be without Andre ? " Further proof that viewers find Riney ' s ads believable is Dick Maugg ' s claim that people actually wrote to Ed Jaymes offering help on his second mortgage . Riney ad copy usually treats the customer as someone probably as intelligent as the person writing the ad : " Satisfy your Walter Mitty mind , " was a line in a gently prodding song that played over scenes of just-plain folks riding Yamaha motorcycles . There ' s also a very laid-back California quality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t really necessary . " If you ' re not home cooking , Swanson is . " That line  --  and a suggestion from Riney ' s research staff that Swanson add parsley to the mashed potatoes and pearl onions to the peas  --  helped reposition and rejuvenate that Campbell ' s Soup division ' s tired old TV dinners . In another example , old codgers  --  Irish , this time  --  are in their favorite pub talking about Father Murphy ' s sermon against whiskey and beer . " Did he mention ale ? " one asks . " Why , no , I don ' t believe he did , " another replies , as the innkeeper sets up Henry Weinhard ales . " Fine man , Father Murphy . " That sort of wry , off-the-wall , almost-insider humor is what clients know Riney will deliver . It ' s Frank Bartles attempting to help supporters prepare for the Super Bowl by explaining strikes , spares , pins and , yes , bowling , while a straight-faced Ed Jaymes displays pictures of bowling pins and balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to an 1880s bar for the best beer in town and then turning to a dance-hall girl with , " Hi , and what ' s your sign ? " And a spot for the Oakland A ' s baseball team during Billy Martin ' s brief career there as manager that became a cult classic despite the fact it never ran outside the San Francisco Bay area . In it an elderly woman sitting on a porch recalls little Billy Martin : " A good boy , a quiet boy . He was a shy child who was polite to everybody . I remember . . . " Cut to her husband tapping his noggin and declaring , " Mother don ' t remember too good anymore . " Directors and other creative sorts become rhapsodic talking about how beautiful Riney ' s ads are on film . He ' s a lover of the great outdoors , a fly fisherman with a passion for steelhead , and a remarkable number of his ads seem to require a journey to some gorgeous spot . Sometimes this works ; other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell about a campaign of TV and print ads touting water " from back when the Earth was pure " as the secret of Wisconsin ' s Heileman ' s Old Style beer . The ads featured prehistoric men and bears . " They were gorgous , but , geez , they looked like Scientific American , and we were trying to introduce the beer in Georgia , " he laughs . " Nobody knew what the hell the ads were about . " The most famous of such mythic spots was a parable he wrote about nuclear armament for the 1984 Reagan campaign . While a bear menacingly roams the woods , Riney solemnly notes : " Some people say the bear is tame . Others say it ' s vicious and dangerous . Since no one really can be sure who ' s right , isn ' t it smart to be as strong as the bear ? " The campaign released the ad shortly after Reagan did poorly in his first debate with Walter Mondale and just before the second debate , when Reagan ' s lead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it , the President ' s lead soon ballooned from 11 points to 20 . Riney didn ' t write the AT &; spot " Reach out and touch someone , " but that ' s what he tries to do , as in another lyrical but controversial ad for the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984 . " It ' s morning again in America , " Riney ' s voice said over quick scenes of a warm daybreak , smiling workers pouring into factories , a beaming young couple getting married ( and the bride running into her grandmother ' s outstretched arms ) , young marrieds buying first homes and chubby toddlers waving flags . " Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago ? " It is this Riney hallmark  --  the use of feelings  --  and this ad more than any other , that disturb Riney ' s critics . Riney wrote and produced it as part of the elite Tuesday Team Inc. , a group of advertising eminences called together in 1984 to volunteer their talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was pretty crafty , " complains one agency executive , putting a negative spin on the word . " I couldn ' t do work like that and feel proud of it . I am a Democrat and I wouldn ' t do it for the Democrats . " The overriding worry is that presidents aren ' t products , and it ' s a scary thing in a democracy if the advertising industry can sell candidates to the public with the same banalities , with the same macho and flag-waving that sell beer . Yet one Chicago agency executive points out that political candidates are , unfortunately , too much like beer , or , more accurately , " too much like a brand of soap . ' Parity products , ' they ' re called . " At the grocery store , when people see two brands and say either one is acceptable because there ' s too little difference , that ' s a parity product . When an election turns out few voters , they ' re saying either candidate is acceptable . Parity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable difference , " he notes . Riney ' s staunch but seldom-exercised Republicanism ( " I ' m usually out of town ; I don ' t vote very much " ) seems to express that view of political advertising exactly . He says he was flattered to be asked to work on the President ' s team , that he did it merely for the chance at getting a picture of himself with Reagan for his office wall . His political philosophy , he says , can be summed up very easily . " I tend to want less from government . I didn ' t get free school lunches when I was a kid , and I really don ' t think those things should exist . " ( MORE ) Illustration PHOTOS 8 <>
