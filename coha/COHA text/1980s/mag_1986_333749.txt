After IBM and General Motors announced last month that they planned to sell off their operations in South Africa , speculation quickly began over which big U.S. manufacturer would be next to go . Last week Eastman Kodak joined the growing list of departing companies , but Kodak went further than any other firm . The world 's largest film and camera maker said it will not only sell its South African business , as other companies have done , but will refuse to sell any products to South African customers . Word of Kodak 's withdrawal came one day after a three-week strike ended at a GM plant that is being sold to local managers and on the same day that Hong Kong announced new sanctions . At week 's end Canada-based Bata , a major shoe manufacturer , said it would sell its South African operations to foreign investors . <P> Kodak 's decision stung . For the first time , a major U.S. company had said it was selling its assets and simply walking away . Western firms that leave South Africa typically continue selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets of the departing corporations . According to Kodak , its South African revenues were less than 1% of its $10 billion worldwide sales last year . Said Kodak Chairman Colby Chandler : " We can not see with any certainty a time when South Africa will be free from apartheid . The implication of that situation is a degree of business risk that we do not consider prudent . " Kodak 's 466 local employees , 61% of whom are nonwhite , have been told that they will lose their jobs . <P> At the GM plant in Port Elizabeth , already one of South Africa 's most economically depressed cities , striking workers had sought severance pay from departing GM and two seats on the new board . The walkout ended when GM threatened to fire employees who did not return to work . Although 785 of the 1,800 strikers eventually lost their jobs , GM said that most of those dismissed could reapply . <P> Hong Kong , which earlier this year banned imports of South Africa 's gold Krugerrand coins , extended the sanctions to iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , will still be allowed . Hong Kong also asked firms in the British crown colony to halt voluntarily new investments and loans to South Africa . Said Piers Jacobs , financial secretary of Hong Kong : " The measures would bring Hong Kong in line with those governments that are our principal trading partners . " <P> In the wake of the latest punitive measures against South Africa , State President P.W . Botha charged that his government 's efforts to reform apartheid were being ignored by other countries . In a ceremony that opened a medical center in Cape Province , Botha called sanctions " anti-South African legislation . " He added that " the U.S. has already declared an economic war against us for the most absurd and sanctimonious reasons . In doing so , they have yet again taken up the sword against us on behalf of the Soviet Union and its goals in this region . I find it revolting . " As others find apartheid , which is why the corporate exodus from South Africa is certain to increase .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
