ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE ATTRACTIONS , Best of ( Columbia ) : Like live albums , greatest-hit packages all too often are little more than filler between studio albums . But the best of the genre  --  such as " The Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions "  --  help put an artist ' s development into perspective . Here we see Costello evolve from punk to stylist . Although the changes seemed abrupt on his albums , these 16 tracks flow easily from first to last . A slightly different collection is being released on a $24. 98 videotape . Costello is teaming up with T-Bone Burnette for a studio album due in February . CLARENCE CLEMONS , Hero ( Columbia ) : Albums such as " Hero " make you realize just how much technology has changed music in the last two years . The Big Man ' s first solo effort , 1983 ' s " Rescue , " was a rollicking romp through traditional rhythm and blues . Now with synthesizers and drum machines at his disposal , Clemons creates a sound far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over singing duties as well , even sharing a duet with the long-silent Jackson Browne on " You ' re a Friend of Mine . " A lot of the responsibility for the new sound can be attributed to producer Narada Michael Walden , the man behind Aretha Franklin ' s " Who ' s Zoomin ' Who ? " That should tell you a lot about how " Hero " sounds : " Freeway of Love " without Lady Soul . SHEENA EASTON , Do You ( EMI ) : Once a demure Scottish lass , Sheena Easton made her commercial mark last year singing about her privates . Obviously , she intends to continue that formula on her latest album . From its suggestive title , " Do You " ( no question mark ) to lyrics such as " Hold me for one steamy kiss , " nothing here is as explicit as " Sugar Walls , " but Easton always seems to be hinting in that direction . JAMES TAYLOR , That ' s Why I ' m Here ( Columbia ) : His first studio album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal problems behind him , he expounds the virtues of making peace with one ' s self . " Perfect strangers . . . pay good money to hear fire and rain/Again and again and again/Some are like summer coming back every year/ . . . I break into a grin from ear to ear/ And suddenly it ' s perfectly clear/That ' s why I ' m here , " he sings on the title song . The albums ' s 10 cuts include a lilting cover of Buddy Holly ' s classic " Everyday " and " Going Around One More Time , " penned by Taylor ' s brother Livingston . Also along for the ride are Graham Nash , Joni Mithell , David Sanborn , Don Henley , Deniece Williams and Rosemary Butler . PRECIOUS METAL , Right Here , Right Now ( Mercury ) : You knew it was inevitable  --  sooner or later Quiet Riot would get the Go-Gos into the back seat . The unfortunate offspring of that illicit tryst is Precious Metal , an all-female heavy-metal band . Lead singer Leslie Knauer-Wasser favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just about says it all . MONDAY , MONDAY : Monday may not be so blue with albums such as these set for release on the 18th : Stevie Nicks ' " Rock A Little , " Steel Pulse ' s " Babylon the Bandit , " a Bette Midler comedy album called " Mud Will Be Flung Tonight , " Arcadia ' s " So Red the Rose " and Twisted Sister ' s " Come Out and Play.
