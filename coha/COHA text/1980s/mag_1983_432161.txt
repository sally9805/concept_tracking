 | Bursting with renewed confidence , U.S. tourists are leaving home this summer for the biggest vacation traveling spree in years . Not since the 1970s , say the experts , have Americans been so willing to shell out money for journeys both within this country and abroad . " Americans are shaking off the gloom of recession and making up for some of the trips they postponed or canceled last year , " remarks Douglas Frechtling , director of the U.S. Travel Data Center in Washington , D.C. Most striking is the upsurge in travel overseas , where cut-rate air fares and a strong American dollar are a big lure . The U.S. Passport Office reports that applications are running 24 percent ahead of last year , and that most of these tourists are heading to Europe . Pan American World Airways says that its planes to and from Europe ran an average of 67.4 percent full in June , up from 60.8 percent at the same time last year . Officials expect a bigger surge through the rest of July and August , and the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people who are taking off for Europe ? it 's incredible , " comments Mary Patterson , a St. Paul , Minn. , travel agent . Travelers say they are attracted not only by air fares but also by the values they can get overseas . The British pound , for example , is now worth $1.55 , compared with $2.37 three years ago . " I am going over now because I can stay in first-class hotels again , while a couple of years ago it was impossible , " explains Carol Ann Garrick , a San Mateo , Calif. , schoolteacher who is traveling to England and Scotland . Says Minnesota businessman John Nemetz : " The surprising thing was riding in a cab watching fares go up to 39 francs and realizing it was only $4 or $5 , or going to a restaurant and seeing it was quite reasonable . " Another lure for Americans is the price war among transatlantic air carriers . Many airlines offer $549 round-trip fares from New York to London this summer . People Express sells one-way tickets from Newark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reducing their fares drastically beginning this fall . European tourist officials count on these Yankee travelers to offset lackluster spending by European vacationers . The British Tourist Authority expects 2 million Americans to visit Britain this year , a 15 percent increase over 1982 and the largest number ever . Strong lures . London , Stonehenge , Bath , Windsor and Oxford are still big draws for Americans . Guests from the U.S. at the Stratford-Upon-Avon Hilton have increased 25 percent this year . Many arrive by car without reservations ? a new phenomenon at the resort . British Rail 's sales of BritRail passes in the U.S. are " buoyant " this year , and bus-tour operators note improvement , too . Even such small hotels as the Arundell Arms in Devonshire , which specializes in fly-fishing holidays , report " more inquiries from America than ever before . " In Rome , American Express estimates that 10 percent more Americans are visiting Italy this year , and adds that they are noticeably younger . An Italian innkeeper grouses : " There may be more Americans around , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " American travelers to France can profit from the high rate of 7.6 francs to the dollar , and are said to be spending 50 percent more , on average , than traveling Europeans . French authorities say tourism from America is running 30 percent ahead of 1982 . Paris hotels are booked through the summer , and Yanks are helping keep barge cruises profitable in Loire and Burgundy . But reservations on the Mediterranean coast are down as much as 20 percent . While Europe remains the big draw , there 's no lack of travel to other destinations . Pan Am says traffic has increased sharply on its Pacific routes to Australia , New Zealand , Japan , the Philippines and China . By contrast , trips to debt-plagued Latin America are down dramatically . " Mexico was very popular last winter , but many travelers were scared off because prepaid hotel arrangements were not honored , " notes Edward Stewart , a Pittsburgh travel agent . While the strong dollar encourages  | people to go abroad , an improving economy and plenty of gasoline at good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " Many of the travel businesses we have surveyed have already seen increased sales and bookings and are predicting even greater growth as the summer continues , " remarks William Toohey , president of the Travel Industry Association of America . The most popular U.S. destination this year , travel experts agree , is Disney 's EPCOT Center near Orlando , visited by millions since opening last October . Hot spots . Also reported to be doing exceptionally well this summer are Atlantic City , the Adirondacks , Texas and Ocean City , Md . United Airlines reports continued strong demand for flights to California , Arizona and Hawaii . Business is also brisk at amusement parks . George Delanoy of Six Flags Corporation says attendance is up about 10 percent over last summer at the company 's eight theme parks despite a wet spring at many of them . Many resorts report that people are staying longer .

The Air Transport Association estimates that more than 300 million passengers will be carried by U.S. airlines this year , up from 239 million in 1982 and enough to put the industry in the black for 1983 . Air travel could possibly exceed the record 317 million passengers of 1979 , the ATA says . Some spinoffs . Car-rental firms are prospering again , as well . Craig Koch , a vice president of Hertz , says the company received 60,000 phone calls for reservations on one day in June . He estimates car rentals this summer will run 15 to 20 percent ahead of 1982 . Domestic bus companies and Amtrak are being helped , too . Trailways sold out its charter-bus service on the July 4 weekend . Amtrak ridership this year is running 10 to 12 percent ahead of 1982 , and revenues are up 15 to 20 percent . In general , the spinoff for business has been remarkable .

Tourists visiting Florida gave us a billion dollars in tax revenue last year . " By MICHAEL DOAN with the magazine 's European bureaus U.S.NEWS &; WORLD REPORT , July 18 , 1983
