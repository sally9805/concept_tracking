At a recent antique show , dealer Robert Wilkins of Austerlitz , N.Y. , spoke for many other dealers when he said : ' ' The market is very healthy right now . The public is reflecting increasing sophistication and knowledge , and they ' re buying. ' ' // Crowds pour through ticket gates at shows and flea markets across the country , antique shops are multiplying , auctions continue to set record-breaking prices , buyers are developing into serious collectors , and the casual buyers and novice collectors are finding items at their levels of interest. // It ' s the quality shows that are attracting serious buyers and encouraging collectors. // Dean Failey , head of Christie ' s New York American Decorative Arts Department , says : ' ' Auctions are a bit of the pulse beat in terms of measuring where the market is going , because we stand between seller and buyer , collector and dealer . When things get tight , it shows up right away . Last year we saw dealers become more selective , but this past fall things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // Irving Slavid , a dealer from Sherborn , Mass. , and his wife , Judith Applegate , echo thoughts of others in the field who say that ' ' buying antiques for investment is no longer the case . The private investor couldn ' t find an outlet for his goods . You can buy something for $1 and turn it over for $2 at a 100 percent profit , but you can ' t do that with $10 , 000. ' ' // Harold Corbin of Three Ravens Antiques in Salisbury , Conn. , adds : ' ' In general , people ' s investment attention is on the stock market . Antiques can ' t keep up with inflation , and the markup is getting smaller - the higher the price , the lower the markup . But you ' ll always be safe in purchasing high-quality pieces. ' ' // The consensus , confirmed by Raymond B. Knight of Locust Valley , Long Island , N.Y. , is that ' ' people are putting their money somewhere else for investment and using the profits to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do increase in value while giving pleasure. ' ' // In Bolton , Mass . , Steve Fletcher of Robert Skinner ' s auction galleries reveals the key to buying antiques : ' ' Build a collection rather than an accumulation ' ' of merchandise , he says . ' ' The proof of this is in the performance of what we ' ve seen on our records over the years. ' ' // Everyone agrees that the best pieces continue to bring in the highest prices , and there will always be a market here . But as prices escalate , pieces become harder to find . Scudder Smith , editor and publisher of Antiques and the Arts Weekly , observes : ' ' As the quality pieces become harder to find , the lesser items become more obvious . While the best pieces continue to do well , various levels of quality are developing . There seems to be a market at all levels , and each element has its own following. ' ' // Dealers and auctioneers are finding a more sophisticated following . One reason can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Sideli , antique-show managers from Malden Bridge , N.Y. , integrate history and education into their shows by supporting American landmarks . This tends , they say , to ' ' promote an awareness among collectors as to the history and value of our national heritage and artifacts. ' ' // According to Jonathan Trace of Putnam Valley , N.Y. : ' ' There is no question that customers continue to become more scholarly . In the past 20 years , so much more reference material has become available , and there is greater consciousness among the buying public. ' ' // Wickford , R.I. , dealer Stephanie Wood adds : ' ' People are more eclectic . If young people can ' t afford 18th- and 19th-century pieces , the positive thing is that they are thinking ' quality ' in later items , such as wood furniture from the 1950s. ' ' // That is what Bethany , Conn. , dealer Robert Kneeland thinks makes the business encouraging . ' ' Dealers and customers are not as concerned about age as they are in looking at fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , ' ' he says . Adding to this , Don Abarbanel of Ashley Falls , Mass. , says : ' ' If a piece is well made and has good design , then that is its value . Simply because it ' s old doesn ' t make it valuable. ' ' // Reflecting upon this , Sam Pennington , editor and publisher of the Maine Antiques Digest , says : ' ' The business tends to be self-renewing . When one item becomes scarce , we expand our vision to pick up something else - like 20th-century pieces. ' ' // The antique business has had to expand its vision . Not only did prices for early pieces soar to astronomical heights , but a scarcity of goods became evident . Mr. Pennington explains : ' ' There was an incredible outpouring on the market of early pieces during 1973-1981 , when prices crested because of inflation . People sold heavily , and now we ' re making up for it . Consequently , things are being held back from all elements . We can ' t order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The field of antiques doesn ' t follow the normal economic rules. ' ' // It ' s just this fact that spurred Patty Gagarin , a dealer from Fairfield , Conn. , to remark : ' ' The serious pieces which were once wonderful at $1 , 000 are not so wonderful today at $10 , 000 . There is a scarcity of good , early things. ' ' // Within this scarcity , Nina Hellman , a marine-antique dealer from Bedford , N.Y. , says : ' ' The good things are selling , and there are new collectors who will educate themselves and spend money . They are more selective , and so we dealers need to be more selective. ' ' // Many dealers note that an antique generally can be purchased less expensively than its modern equivalent , and the antique is often better made . Customers are finding their purchase of the antiques to be a better investment financially and practically , as well as aesthetically. // While the quality pieces continue to be at the top of the list ( such as American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk art ) , some of the other strong areas include architectural items such as early door hinges , iron gates , finials , fanlights , walls , and mantles . Jerard P. Jordan of Ashford , Conn. , is finding a demand for these items from those clients mixing modern and old in their art and decoration , as well as in the restoration of homes. // ' ' The classics never change , ' ' Max Seigel of Covered Bridge Antiques in New York City explains . ' ' Fashion in antiques , like fashion in anything else , comes and goes. ' ' // Collecting has broken barriers . What was primarily limited to early furniture and accessories now includes 20th-century art . People are buying because they enjoy antiques and art and are looking to other places for investment . The field offers items to the serious collector as well as the new buyer . The early items are scarce , but they can be found .
