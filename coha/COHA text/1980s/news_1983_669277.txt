' ' Their suggestions led to practicality , which led to better quality , ' ' says Howard Freers , chief engineer at Ford. // For the past few years , quality has been a top management concern for the Big Three automakers here . Now the commitment is filtering down to the rank and file . ' ' They ( the workers ) believe this is the real thing , that it ' s not just an alert , ' ' comments Don Douglas , president of United Automobile Workers Local 594 in Pontiac , Mich. // And according to analysts and auto executives , the quality gap between United States and Japanese cars is closing rapidly. // ' ' There is no comparison of the quality of ( Detroit ' s ) cars today with last year - or two years ago . It ' s tremendously improved , ' ' comments David Cole , director of automotive transportation study at the University of Michigan. // Consider these signs of improvement : // // * Car warranty expenses at Chrysler are down 44 percent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice-president for quality , says it looks as if 1983 will account for 24 percentage points of that decrease. // // * And automakers no longer rush new models to meet launching deadlines . Ford ' s new Tempo and Topaz missed their deadlines because the company spent more time getting them up to par . The same thing happened with General Motors ' 1984 Corvette . And GM ' s new ' ' C ' ' cars - the luxury lines for Oldsmobile , Buick , and Cadillac - didn ' t make the target production date , either . GM is correcting some ' ' undesirable , though not catastrophic , ' ' problems , says Alex Mair , vice-president for engineering at GM . Later this year the cars will be produced at two brand new plants - ' ' the best ( plants ) in the world , ' ' Mr. Mair asserts. // // * At Ford , the quality index for cars has improved 59 percent since 1980 , points out Joseph Forgione , director of quality assurance for Ford ' s North American operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers have with Ford cars. // Quality ' ' wasn ' t always No. 1 ( at GM ) , ' ' recalls Mair , but ' ' since foreign competition , it has become No. 1 . ' ' He explains that GM has come to realize that emphasis on quality brings other factors into line : With quality comes productivity ; with productivity comes cost reduction ; with cost reduction come higher profits. // At GM ' s Cadillac engine plant in Livonia ( its show plant when it comes to quality and productivity ) , Robert Stramy , the manager there , says the 1984 budget will manage with 20 percent less than the ' 83 budget. // Quality improvement systems are in place throughout the industry . Engineering departments now work with manufacturing to make sure they design products that can be manufactured easily . Parts testing occurs much earlier in the new-product process . Competitors ' cars are stripped down and analyzed to an extent never done before . Robotics , statistical analysis , and tighter inventory control have made astonishing inroads . Less variance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting up everywhere . And manufacturers are insisting on quality from suppliers . Chrysler , for instance , has started holding five-day workshops with suppliers to pass along what has been learned about improving quality. // But these systems don ' t have their full effect until ' ' the whole quality mind-set ' ' pervades the entire company , reasons Mr. Forgione at Ford . He says that Ford ' s ' ' initial ( quality ) thrust was at engineering and manufacturing ' ' but that ' ' the thing now is to make it a total , companywide effort. ' ' // That ' s a tough job . At the Ford Escort plant in Wayne , Mich. , huge banners spread the message : ' ' Quality is job one . ' ' But slogans aren ' t enough , and this plant , like other Ford plants , is trying to get its employee involvement program ( EI ) off the ground . All 3 , 200 employees at the plant will eventually go through a one-day seminar about problem solving , quality issues , communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly and office workers meet weekly in teams to discuss quality and work life issues. // But the people managing the EI program are moving ahead with caution and deliberate slowness . ' ' The skeptics are just waiting to take one good shot at us , ' ' says Martin Kennedy , coordinator of EI at the plant . Mr. Kennedy admits some people in the plant think the whole program is political and don ' t trust management. // Macon Bomar , a bargaining committee member of UAW Local 900 in Wayne , says that ' ' workers are still skeptical . Something that existed over many years just doesn ' t change overnight. ' ' // At the same time , Mr. Bomar believes more workers are receptive to EI . ' ' Poor quality was what caused us to lose our jobs . . . and more employees think the involvement system will lead to quality . ' ' He thinks Ford is ' ' committed ' ' to quality but fears the company may turn its back on it if demand really picks up . Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 years at Ford comments that ' ' there ' s no comparison ' ' of Ford quality today with a few years back . The repair section for defective cars , for instance , has been almost entirely eliminated. // Management has found that worker interest and participation differ from plant to plant . Spreading the quality atmosphere through whole plants is easier when you start from scratch , says Mr. Stramy , eating lunch in the brightly colored employee cafeteria at the Livonia Cadillac engine plant. // Two years ago engine production switched from a Detroit plant to the new factory at Livonia . Together , workers and management established a plant philosophy of communication , trust , individual and company growth , and quality . They set up business teams for weekly reviews of quality , safety , and work area problems , and of the plant ' s financial status . Workers and management share the same cafeteria , lockers , and dress codes. // The plant also runs a unique program called pay-by-knowledge , whereby workers increase their base pay and rotate jobs as they learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the program says : ' ' I did the same job for 10 years . It was a real drag . I was subject to slacking off . . . I ' m still a common laborer but at least now I have a chance to challenge myself every day. ' ' // Of all the quality methods at the plant , ' ' the team concept is the greatest advantage , ' ' Stramy says . Every statistical indicator that workers use to keep tabs on quality ' ' is going in the right direction , ' ' he adds . He also attributes low absenteeism , a reduction in scrap and repair , a drop in manpower cost per unit , and worker-initiated quality improvement to the fact that ' ' management is not repressive here - workers have freedom to contribute. ' ' // Despite all these efforts - and recognized improvements in quality - Detroit still has a bad image . In its annual auto survey , Consumer Reports magazine this year rated several 1983 US cars as average or worse than average in product reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just can ' t say you ' ve got it . You have to earn the trust of the general public , ' ' comments Mr. Cole at the University of Michigan. // Alex Mair at GM figures it will be about five years before GM can ' ' fully ' ' gain that trust . ' ' You ' ve got to remember , ' ' he says with a smile , ' ' that already 80 percent of GM buyers think we ' re great. ' ' // In George Butts ' s opinion , the auto industry will spend more effort trying to change the public ' s perception of US auto quality . How does Chrysler do it ? ' ' We wake people up , ' ' he shouts . ' ' We tell people that we ' re so confident about our quality that we ' ll guarantee them five years or 50 , 000 miles . ' ' But to get consumers to spread the word means ' ' we have to build and deliver . The image will change through time by having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver for the US automakers ? // Says Robert Knoll , head of the auto test division at Consumer Reports and the man who may influence American buyers the most : ' ' The bottom line is they are getting better . . . . In the showroom , the cars are looking very good , but the more important step is how their cars will hold up in two or three years , and the jury ' s out on that. ' ' // //
