After she had put the roses on the grave , Alda Sizemore commenced the story of how Old Red the coon dog got run over by a train . " It was just awful , " she sighed , and then she said , " but let me go get my husband . He tells it so much better , and he was there , after all . " <P> The woman went and fetched Ross Sizemore from under a sugar-maple tree , where he was quietly whittling a cedar stick . He was wearing a cap that said FUZZY 'S FEEDS SINCE 1956 . <P> " Train killed Old Red , " Ross Sizemore said . On Sunday , Nov. 18 , 1974 , he had been keen to go coon hunting  --  " wanted to go so bad I could n't stand it " was the way he put it  --  but there was something disrespectful about hunting on Sunday so he made himself wait until after midnight . At 3 a.m . Sizemore and Old Red were on a train trestle when a southbound freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and it was a 20-ft. drop to solid rock . I figured a fall would butcher me up or kill me one . I just laid down on the side , right on the edge and just hung on . The train went on by , and I walked back to find my dog , and there he lay across that rail . It sure was a sad night for me . " <P> " We 've been bringing live roses here for ten years , " Alda Sizemore said . " Ai n't that terrible ? " <P> " I was offered $1,000 for that dog just before he got killed , " Ross Sizemore said in a sort of more's-the-pity way . <P> To the Sizemores , there was no question where Old Red 's remains should rest : they put him in a sack and bore him to the Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard , where the rich totemic significance of the breed has been celebrated since Sept. 4 , 1937 , the day Troop , a coon dog of towering integrity , breathed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like a son , put the dog in a 6-ft. - long cotton-picker 's sack and brought him out here to the piney woods in the northwestern corner of Alabama and buried him in a hole 3 ft. deep . Then he got a rock , and with a hammer and a screwdriver and cold chisel he etched out a cross and Troop 's name and the date of his birth and the date of his death . Now 48 years later , 160 coon dogs are buried in the cemetery , and every year in September their owners come out to recall their handsome deeds and to eat barbecue . That is precisely what Mr. and Mrs. Sizemore were doing . <P> Key Underwood , who would be 83 years old on Sept. 11 , was there too , and when people sought him out , asking if he was the Key Underwood , he would say , " What 's left of him . " Then they would ask him about Troop , and he would say , " Troop was just as humble as he could be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it come to Mr. Coon , that was something else . He 'd walk around a coon until he saw an opening , and he 'd move in there and grab him on those foreshoulders , and you could hear the bones pop . That was some dog . " <P> A clot of listeners would form around Underwood as he talked , and every once in a while someone would offer encouragement in a most exuberant dialect . " At dogud tree ! " What the man said was , " That dog could tree , " meaning Troop had an unerring nose for raccoons.
