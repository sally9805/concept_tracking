The former infantry captain whom President-elect Ronald Reagan calls " my Disraeli " is charged with the awesome task of solving the complex problems of the nation ' s armed forces. // Why would Mr. Weinberger forsake the vice-presidency of the Bechtel Corporation , a multinational engineering company , to take on such a job ? // " The President-elect asked me to do so , and I have always found it very difficult to say no to presidents , " he declares . " I believe very strongly in Governor Reagan and what he ' s trying to do  --  what he has done in California and what I think he can do for the nation. " // Weinberger says he intends " to do my best and to have the defense forces of the United States in a state of full readiness to perform for the maintenance of the peace of the world. " // Observers note that the new secretary ' s first task after moving into his office at the Pentagon will be to resolve a dispute between the President-elect ' s defense advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . On the one hand , William Van Cleave , Mr. Reagan ' s senior defense adviser , believes that " the highest national priority " should be given to " fixing the weaknesses in our strategic posture as rapidly as possible . " But opponents of this view , most notably Sen. John Tower ( R ) of Texas , a one-time contender for the post of defense secretary and soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committe , favors the immediate invigoration of US conventional forces , believing that their Soviet counterparts are a much more immediate threat than any current US strategic inferiority. // Quite apart from helping determine national defense strategy , Mr. Weinberger will inherit a series of troubled weapons systems from the Carter administration , primarily the Trident submarine program , the woes of which are to be investigated by Congress next year , and the Navy ' s F-18 fighter , which has encountered cost , production , and performance problems. // Weinberger will also have to wrestle with deployment of the controversial MX missile system . Proposals to base it in Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many defense experts , and as anathema by numerous environmentalists and residents of the states concerned. // Caspar Willard Weinberger was born in San Francisco on Aug. 8 , 1917 . He was graduated magna cum laude with an AB degree from Harvard in 1938 , and three years later received an LLB degree from the university ' s law school . He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. // During World War II he saw service with the 41st Infantry Division in the Pacific before being transferred to Gen. Douglas MacArthur ' s intelligence staff . He was discharged from the Army in 1945 with the rank of captain and a bronze star. // In 1952 Weinberger was elected to the California Legislature , and reelected in 1954 and 1956 without opposition . In 1955 he was voted the most able member of the state legislature by reporters who covered the session. // Governor Reagan made him director of finance for California , and he turned a state budget deficit into a surplus , earning himself a smiling photograph of the governor inscribed : " The smile is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards , Ron. " // Two years later Weinberger joined the Nixon administration as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission . Subsequently , he served as deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget ( 1970-72 ) , director of OMB ( 1972-73 ) , and HEW secretary ( 1973-75 ) . He joined Bechtel Power Corporation ' s general counsel in 1975. // Mr. Weinberger , who has reviewed books for California newspapers and has recently been writing a newspaper column , once described himself as " a frustrated newspaperman . " Reputedly endowed with a wry , even self-deprecating , sense of humor , he is an avid theater and concertgoer , though some contend that his real recreation is hard work . As state finance director in California he frequently arrived at his office at 7 a. m. and worked into the night . Weinberger and his wife Jane have two children : Arlin cerise and Caspar Willard Jr. // " Cap " Weinberger ' s selection for the Pentagon post has not received universal acclamation in the defense community . Critics point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters and that he returns to Washington with a reputation for budget slashing to head an agency that is about to embark on massively increased spending. // But others point to the fact that he has proved himself a first-rate manager both at OMB and HEW , and assert that a man of his intellectual gifts will undoubtedly learn rapidly on the job . In any case , they add , he has legions of experts at the Pentagon to draw on. // His longtime advocacy of higher military spending will undoubtedly endear him to the Pentagon brass , they add. // Many defense analysts are waiting to see what other appointments are made within the office of the secretary of defense before passing judgment on the Weinberger appointment . " It really depends on how he sets up his subcabinet , " says one member of the President-elect ' s defense transition team . " If you get the right people in underneath him , you could look at this as a very astute choice. " // The source maintains that Weinberger needs a deputy secretary of defense with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , presently occupied by W. Graham Claytor , would be admirably filled by William Van Cleave . " He ' s the leading contender because of his position as senior adviser to Governor Reagan during the campaign and as defense transition team leader here. " // The source adds that if Weinberger attempts to bring in his old colleague , Frank Carlucci , at present deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency , to fill the position as it is rumored he might , such an action would engender fierce opposition in Reagan transition circles . Mr. Carlucci , according to the sources , is " a Carter man who helped decimate the CIA. " // //
