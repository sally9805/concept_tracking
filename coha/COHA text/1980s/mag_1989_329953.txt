IF THIS WAS HAPPINESS : A BIOGRAPHY OF RITA HAYWORTH <P> by Barbara Leaming <P> Viking ; 404 pages ; $19.95 <P> The photograph appeared in LIFE 's Aug. 11 , 1941 , issue and later became a ubiquitous pinup during World War II : a surrealistically gorgeous woman partially dressed in a shimmering negligee knelt on a bed and smiled enigmatically over her bare left shoulder . Inspired by this stunning vision in black-and-white , countless G.I.s knew exactly what they were fighting for . Mom , apple pie and Rita Hayworth . <P> Maybe one of those soldiers could have come home and saved her from her sad , passive fate . But If This Was Happiness makes such a possibility seem unlikely . Barbara Leaming , who has also written biographies of Roman Polanski and Orson Welles ( Rita Hayworth 's second husband ) , argues that Hollywood 's Love Goddess was doomed from childhood to a private hell of uncertainty and unhappiness . <P> The principal villain in this piece is the actress 's father , an itinerant Spanish dancer named Eduardo Cansino . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be his partner in his nightclub act . Leaming contends that he also sexually abused her . The evidence here is spotty , based solely on Welles ' word that Hayworth once admitted as much to him . But as a working hypothesis , the trauma of incest may explain a lifetime of otherwise inexplicable , self- destructive blunders . <P> Hayworth married , five times , men who were wrong for her . Her first husband , a drifter and grifter named Eddie Judson , was roughly her father 's age . Although he helped turn a chubby young dancer into a screen siren , his methods were brutal ; he offered her body to those in Hollywood who could advance her career . She claimed to have been happy with Welles , at least before his infidelities became too blatant . " If this was happiness , " Welles told Leaming years later , " imagine what the rest of her life had been . " <P> This biography leaves little to the imagination . Divorced from Welles and entrusted with the care of their daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she married . . . Aly Khan , already fabled in the tabloids for his wealth and promiscuity . Before long she ran back to America , with another daughter , Yasmin , in tow . And then she married Dick Haymes , a failing nightclub singer with big problems in the area of unpaid alimony and back taxes . <P> Amid all these messes , she made some memorable movies , including Gilda and Miss Sadie Thompson . But the final years were awful . She abandoned her last film role in 1972 . Eight years later , she was diagnosed as having Alzheimer 's disease , and Yasmin cared for her until her death in 1987 . Leaming 's prose can gush ( " the incomparable Hermes Pan , " " the fabulous Eartha Kitt " ) and regularly descends to write-by-the-numbers cliche . But the material is poignant , another reminder of the chasm that can exist between public images and private pain .
