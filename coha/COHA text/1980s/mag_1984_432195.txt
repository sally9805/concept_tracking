 | SAMMIE BRAMBLETT is not an impulse shopper . The nearest grocery store is an 86-mile trip from her ranch on a bluff above the Rio Grande . The nearest gasoline station , bank , and post office are no closer . At age 74 she lives alone at the end of the longest dead-end road in all Texas . " We pioneered this place in 1935 , " she said as we stood in her dusty backyard , looking across the broad river valley toward a ring of blue mountains shimmering in Mexico . There was no other human habitation as far as the eye could see . " Once you get used to it , it 's no problem . The only thing I miss is the movies . " Electric lights reached the Bramblett household in 1960 . The telephone has still not come ; Sammie communicates with the outside world through a radio rigged so that incoming calls make her car horn blow . Is she ever afraid ? You jest . " I 've got a pistol , and I know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I stand in the door and point this of gun , I do n't have any more trouble . " The most telling fact about Texas west of the Pecos River , where Sammie Bramblett lives , is that by its standards she is no figure from the past . During several weeks of maneuvering a four-wheel-drive vehicle through the canyons , mountains , and desert flats of that isolated region , I met dozens like her , people for whom solitude is the basic fact of life . No one considers them hermits or eccentrics ? not even the cityfolk of Pecos ( population 12,855 ) or Fort Stockton ( population 8,688 ) , towns that are the closest the region gets to mainstream America . Texas west of the Pecos is among the last truly idiosyncratic parts of the United States , and its people are a tough , old-fashioned breed , secure in their convictions and self-sufficient in their ways , delighted to be left alone . Spanish explorers called it the despoblado ? the unpopulated place . Texans who speak today of the Trans-Pecos or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rugged quarter . Though it embraces nine counties and part of a tenth , together the size of South Carolina , it is home to just 55,000 inhabitants , excluding El Paso . The mountains of the Trans-Pecos are the last tail end of the Rockies , and the deluge of westward migration reached them late and weak . Not until the Apaches were defeated in 1881 and the railroad came through in 1883 was the way clear . Even today , Texas west of the Pecos is a place where man 's hold is far from secure . Cora Moore , nearly 90 , was born near Madera Canyon in the Davis Mountains on land her father was the first white man to own . " I had a beautiful life , " she said . " I was an only child . I was my daddy 's cowboy . Oh , we 'd ride all day . There was everything out there you could ever want to have . " Cora 's nephew , John , still owns that land . When ranch manager B. L. Pruitt went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went too . We parked at the road 's end , beside the ruins of a house that a family named Hunsaker built in the 1930s . Once it was a home administered in the grand way ; Cora Moore had told me of the parties , the afternoons of bridge . But help was too far away when the fire broke out . Now it is a ruined shell , its great staircase littered with burned timbers and broken roof tiles . Like hundreds of abandoned homesteads in the Trans-Pecos , it declares the frailty of man 's presence there . Hike a short way up the canyon , and Madera seems as free and boundless as it was when Cora Moore rode there as a child . A trickle of water flowed across the rocks , pooling from time to time in deep green basins . " You can sure hear a pin drop up here , " Pruitt said ? and at that instant there was a scratch of gravel behind us . Half a dozen white-tailed deer skittered into the brush . In the Trans-Pecos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore 's , have nearly spanned it all . Lela Weatherby lives quietly now in Fort Davis , a retired Latin teacher . But as a teenager in the lawless time of Pancho Villa , she was at the Brite Ranch on Christmas Day in 1917 , when Mexican @#  | bandits raided the storehouse , terrorized the inhabitants , and killed three men . The memory of that raid still lingers below the surface of the mind of every rancher within half a day 's ride of the Rio Grande . His door may never be locked , but his gun is always loaded . In Redford , a lonely , two-hour drive from the Brite Ranch , I dropped in on the general store of Enrique Madrid 's family . Theirs is an astonishing home containing more than 9,000 books . In a corner of the store Mrs. Madrid operates what must be the largest private lending library in the United States . I watched as two young girls made their selections and brought them to be recorded in a card file . Almost everything is returned . Redford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else in the lower 48 states . A visitor to Presidio in 1849 described it as a " poor , stricken town " with a " barren and desolate aspect . " It has grown no lovelier since . Though dusk was falling on the first day of autumn , the temperature sign at the First ( and last ) Presidio Bank still read 102 degrees . I felt I had come to the last path of the earth . This was an Indian village when the first Spanish explorers arrived in the 1580s . Men have cultivated the rich soil of its desertringed basin since prehistoric times . Today the shops on its windblown main street conceal behind their plain facades an abundance of luxury goods . Few local ranchers can afford the best of them . But until the peso was devalued in 1982 , wealthy Mexicans from as far away as Chihuahua city flocked to this tiny border town for things they could not find at home . Down the road is a sandy , grassless cemetery . Some headstones had sunk into the ground ; others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer graves were marked only by a scattering of rocks . I stopped at a tiny grave marked simply BOY ; at the shared resting place of Guadalupe Guerrero and Henry Olthoff , who died years apart ( what story there ? ) ; at a simple concrete slab where someone , tracing the lettering by hand before the surface dried , had added a small lopsided heart . Candelaria , upriver from Presidio , is so small that the church celebrates Mass only every other week . But it is a living community whose soul is the immaculate dry-goods store run by two elderly sisters , Frances " Nellie " Howard and Marion Walker . The store has been in their family for threequarters of a century . It is a high-ceilinged period piece with glass-front cabinets . Shoes , cooking pots , bolts of cloth , and cans of food are arranged methodically on shelves behind the counters . Nellie pumps gasoline wearing a sunbonnet and gloves . The sisters ' values are sobriety , honesty , and hard work . Each day from noon to one they close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . They insist that children always speak English inside the store , @#  | regardless of what they speak outside . " You should start early to respect this country , " Nellie says . Decades ago , before irrigation around El Paso sucked the river dry , Candelaria was a cotton town . Now the sisters are the last Anglo residents , their store an embassy of the Texas way of life . The one- or two-room schoolhouse once was a familiar fixture in rural America . In Candelaria it still is . Each Sunday night Johnnie Chambers makes the long journey from her ranch to a cottage in the schoolyard , staying there all week preparing lessons for the 22 Hispanic children of Candelaria Elementary . She is a woman with a purpose . Wearing white slacks and a blouse , her hair in a bun , round pink glasses perched on her nose , she was constantly in motion , teaching grammar , anatomy , and arithmetic . Sometimes she spoke in Spanish , other times in English One moment she was administering tests , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forehead as she taught others geography . A country schoolhouse is as busy as a box of kittens . At the end of the day the children opened @#  | their music books . Johnnie led them in song : - Oh ! Susanna , " " The Blue-tail Fly , " " Brother John . " For a moment I was in a 19th-century frontier Texas schoolroom ; only the students were different . Johnnie let them vote . " Red River Valley , " they shouted as one . I listened : From this valley they say you are going . We will miss your bright eyes and your smile ... . The brilliant afternoon sun streamed across the broad dry Rio Grande . When the sisters are gone and Johnnie Chambers is gone , I thought to myself , this will be Mexico again . Come and sit by my side if you love me , Do not hasten to bid me adieu ; But remember the Red River Valley , And the girl that has loved you so true . High above Candelaria , across an escarpment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller raise Herefords in the spacious grasslands known as the Marfa Highlands . They are lucky enough to pipe water straight into their home from a surface creek fed by perennial springs , but their cattle business is hostage to the weather : The number of cattle per section roughly equals the number of inches of rain per year . The search for water is the one abiding constant of life west of the Pecos . " The word rain ' dominates every conversation , " wrote Texas author Richard West . " Did you get any , how much , where , hope you do . " When torrents come , water runs off with wasteful havoc . The proud Pecos highway bridge near Langtry was 50 feet above the river , but a 20-inch downpour one night in 1954 obliterated it beneath an 86-foot-high wall of water . In the Trans-Pecos , fortune smiles with bared teeth . Leaving the Millers ' ranch , I stopped in Valentine to meet one of West Texas ' most unusual women . Jewel Babb is 83 and widowed many years . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch of his saloon in Langtry , a little boy in overalls stands shyly beside the steps . He grew up to take Jewel as his bride , but that was long ago . Now she lives in a thin frame house , catering to visitors who come to be healed by her psychic powers . Could she , I asked , sum up her life ? She thought along time , so long that I thought she had not heard me . Her eyes seemed to gaze far away . " It was hard , " she finally said . 227  | A young woman arrived carrying her infant girl , whose head lolled from side to side . Jewel laid the child across her lap . She massaged first a leg , then a foot , then toes , her aged leathery hands stroking the smooth baby skin with practiced gentleness ; then she moved them in arcs above the child 's head . The mother watched the ritual respectfully ; afterward , cradling her daughter in her arms , she seemed pleased . Valentine is a division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad . Crews change there , bedding down for the night in comfortable lodgings , while U. S. Border Patrolmen search the waiting freights looking for illegal aliens . At dusk I followed one long train out of Valentine ; it snaked across the horizon in the golden light , shuttling the products of commerce and industry from one coast to another , swallowed up for a moment in this vast and silent emptiness . It slowed for Alpine , the largest of three rival towns in the highland ranch country . Alpine ( population 5,465 ) owes its preeminence to a state college , Sul Ross State University , whose 1,900 students hail from 29 states and 21 foreign countries . The school 's intercollegiate rodeo teams shine in events like bulldogging , saddle bronc riding , and calf roping . Students ' pickup trucks bear signs like " I 'm a roper , not a doper . " More traditionally minded scholars probe the biology and geology of the Chihuahuan desert . Fort Davis , near the University of Texas ' McDonald Observatory , is the highest town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit straitlaced . The courthouse has turnstiles to prevent stray cattle from wandering off the street and into the halls of justice . I found County Judge Ann Scudday in her office , typing her own letters . On her civil @# @#  | court docket only three cases had been filed in the previous four years . Two were settled ; in the other , a landowner failed to appear in court , and a surveyor was granted access across the land . " I wished him luck and told him I hoped he did n't get shot , " she said . The Fort Davis cavalry post , established in the 1850s , has been restored as a historic site . Across the way is Leroy Baeza 's family grocery . He has seen the future , and he likes Fort Davis better . " Growing up here , I could n't wait to get away , " he said . " I went to Los Angeles , and by the time I was 30 , I was chief industrial engineer at Disneyland . I planned the infrastructure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to do your own thing . So I came back here . Now it all seems like a dream . " He stepped inside to help his father sack some groceries . " My daughter was in kindergarten when we left , " he said , cushioning a box of eggs between some paper towels . " Now she 's 16 , and she says , You mean I could have grown up living in Hollywood ! ? ' But here I can let her have the car keys , and I do n't worry if she 's still out at eleven ; there , I 'd worry every time she left the house . Young people do n't appreciate this kind of place . " Marfa , the third of the highland towns , remains what it has been for a hundred years : a tiny self-contained trading center where cattlemen buy necessities . It is " landlocked " by the adjacent ranchers ? unable to grow unless they choose to sell their land . And because growth means newcomers with who-knows-what exotic ways , most reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An hour up the road at Van Horn I encountered that world they try so hard to keep at bay . In 1859 John Butterfield 's stage traveled from the Pecos River to El Paso in 55 hours . Now sleek buses cover the same distance in less than six . But travelers still stop for fuel and refreshment at Van Horn , the only town of consequence for 175 miles on Interstate 10 . To Bill and Gloria Moore , agents for both Greyhound and Trailways , the highway is a conduit for whatever the outside world chooses to deliver . So the windows and doors of their bus-station cafeteria are bruary 1984 Texas West of the Pecos reinforced with heavy metal bars , a rare sight west of the Pecos . " We never know who 's going to walk through that door , " Gloria explained . " People try to steal anything from a candy bar to someone 's baggage . They get drunk on the bus , and the driver puts them off . Hitchhikers think they can sit here all day . " " Ninety-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former lawman , added . Three transcontinental buses arrived together . Dozens of riders poured out to stretch their legs , blinking at the surroundings . One young man leaned against the wall and sipped from something inside a paper bag . For a few minutes it was Los Angeles in Van Horn . Then one by one the buses drove away , and it was again West Texas . As if on cue , a tumbleweed rolled down the street behind them . Occasionally even Angelenos come to stay . A few years ago the Reverend Ted Peck ministered to a Presbyterian church in the suburbs there . Now he has congregations in both Marfa and Fort Davis and a 1,600-square-mile parish to cover in his 1977 Volkswagen bus . I caught up with him at the Marfa church , looking less than his 40 years , wearing blue jeans and cooking stew for the Thursday night Bible class . An Old Testament passage in Hebrew lay open for study on a table . " It 's a little more individualist out here , " he said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse on top of a hill , we visit God . " A man 's faith affects the way business is done . " Big money changes hands here over just a handshake . Of course if it 's land , they bring lawyers . " In the sober , hard existence of the TransPecos , the annual Wick Fowler Memorial World Championship Chili Cook-off is pure comic relief . Held in the ghost town of Terlingua , once a quicksilver mining center 229  | described as " the fartherest you can go without getting anywhere , " it honors the Texas chili guru who in 1967 challenged New York humorist H. Allen Smith to a chili-making duel . ( Smith had provoked Texans by writing that his chili was the best . ) Terlingua was chosen , Smith claimed , because it is " the only place on earth where a disaster would never be noticed , the town itself being a disaster . " Now , for two days each November , a portable village sprouts in the desert . Serious cooks , for w horn chili is ambrosia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose theatrical skits provide a pretext to cavort . I joined 8,000 other spectators , many of them in the waning stages of sobriety , at this mardi gras of the country and western set . There were people dressed , s chili peppers , as monks , as locomotives . There were bouncy women dressed as Dallas Cowboys and bearded men in brassieres as their cheerleaders . There was the Best Little Chili House in Texas . And from many of the simmering caldrons the smells were , well , disturbing . Was it chili , or was it herbicide ? Eastward , the wild exalted country of Big Bend National Park is the scenic heart of the Trans-Pecos . As I drove through its vast silences , the uproar of the chili cook-off receded like a thunderstorm . This was landscape reduced to its essentials , surface and horizon and sky . A love of such land , with its solitude and its spare , sudden beauty , and no less a love of personal independence ? the chance for a man to do as he pleases , unwatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . In Sanderson , a hardy and admirable little town still struggling to recover from a catastrophic flood that struck without warning from a normally dry canyon one dark night in 1965 , I met curly-headed Dudley Harrison , then a candidate for the Texas Legislature ? sheep raiser , entrepreneur , a man who minces no words . " I dislike federal and state government control in any shape , form , or fashion , " he says , an edge to his voice . " I 've lived on the Rio Grande all my life , and we 're a dying breed , I think we are . We 're down to 70 cents a pound on wool , and we ca n't move  | these lambs . The government has tried to keep food prices low , and it 's succeeded at the ranchers ' expense . " And so , like the Roman general Cincinnatus leaving his plow to defend the republic , he offered himself for state representative . When Harrison growls , " I do not believe the federal government can control anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the voice of his constituents , who elected him resoundingly , but also with the spirit of the first men to come to the Trans-Pecos , pursuing independence above all else . When Roy Bean declared himself " the law west of the Pecos " in 1882 , he added a phrase to the English language and gave a whole section of Texas a lasting identity . The premises where he dispensed both liquor and justice stand preserved in Langtry , a depopulated water stop not far from the limestone canyons where the Pecos meets the Rio Grande . When the inaccessible western side of these canyons was opened by the railroad , someone was needed to maintain order , and barkeep Bean , a knockabout who had followed the railroad crews with a tent saloon , was somehow appointed justice of the peace . Was he a hero or a scoundrel ? Some say his peculiar brand of law was the best that could be had under the rough-and-tumble circumstances of the day . But the late Pard  | Schupach , a Dryden rancher who was among the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Langtry the day he died ? old age , I think , and too much beer , and maybe too much mean . There was n't nothing decent about him , nothing . " On the other hand , lean , balding Jack Skiles , a L. , ngtry sheep rancher who supervises the state 's excellent Judge Roy Bean Visitor Center , quoted a lady to me who grew up in Langtry : " Roy Bean might have been a murderer and a robber and a thief , but he was a good man in his way . " I asked Skiles to explain the old rapscallion 's lasting notoriety . " The Maher-Fitzsimmons prizefight . " In 1896 Bean promoted the world heavyweight boxing championship on a sandbar in the Rio Grande . The match had been outlawed by several states before Bean 's offer put it 232 beyond the reach of lawmen . " When all those eastern sportswriters got out here , they did n't have much copy , " Skiles said . " The old judge put on such a show for them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with British actress Lillie Langtry , " the Jersey Lily , " a beauty rumored to have been the mistress of the Prince of Wales , later Edward VII . Bean posted a sign ( misspelled ) declaring his saloon the Jersey Lilly , and told visitors the town of Langtry was named for her . But , says Jack Skiles , " He heard this town had her name ? it was probably named for a railroad man ? and , being a big publicrelations man , Bean thought , Boy howdy ! ' It was all a big blow . " Far upriver from Langtry is a very different Trans-Pecos . In the hour between Sanderson and Fort Stockton , one crosses an @#  | invisible line into the part of the TransPecos most attuned to the modern world . Fort Stockton and Pecos are unlike the rest : in wealth , in bustling tempo , in their cordial attitude toward industry . They are home to nearly half the Trans-Pecos people . Like progressive towns anywhere , they seem eager to grow . Outside Fort Stockton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Jewel Babb practiced the healing arts of the Mexican curanderas , I felt catapulted forward half a century . In a piquant twist , the doctors who run this sparkling new clinic are Thais . Fort Stockton , finding that upwardly mobile young medical graduates tend to spurn small towns , built it purposely to lure new doctors there , and from Bangkok via New York came Prasert Thammasithiboon , M.D. , a surgeon , and his wife , Napaporn Jessadapagorn , a pediatrician . The " Doctors Boon , " for short . " We like it here , " he told me . " In Thailand wet and hot , here dry and hot , eh ? Low unemployment rate , fine schools for the kids . It 's a rich county , that 's good , eh ? We try to adapt to American ways . We enjoy rodeo and western dance . We do n't know how to dance , but we try . " The Boons are not untypical . In Pecos several doctors from Pakistan have settled in to practice . Shallow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks the grandeur of its course near Langtry . The land is flat and charmless . But underneath are wondrous things . Two-thirds of the wealth of the Trans-Pecos is generated in the county where Fort Stockton lies , and it 's spelled p-e-t-r-o-l-e-u-m . The Yates oil field at Iraan owes its name to Ira G. Yates , a struggling grocer . He paid 52.50 an acre for land along the Pecos , where , in 1926 , a veritable inland sea of oil was discovered . Today it still produces 125,000 barrels of oil a day . The mineral rights were long ago leased by the family to corporations , principally Marathon Oil , which operates the field . Surprisingly , Marathon Oil is not the county 's largest employer ; Firestone is . At its test center near Fort Stockton , James Ward and 122 other drivers negotiate new cars around a 7.7-mile oval high-speed track five days a week , 350 miles a day , testing tires and chatting on their CB radios . For .. February 1984 Texas West of the Pecos the first 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd get off work here about 2:30 , be in El Paso that night , and be back here for work in the morning . I 'd put in a 900-mile day . " And for relaxation ? " We 're into motorsicklin ' and boatin ' . Lake Amistad 's just 200 miles away . " These wide-open spaces selc'om enjoy a sense of nature 's fruitful bounty . But in Coyanosa and the Toyah Valley , irrigation from groundwater fosters an exception . Pecans , peppers , and the famous Pecos cantaloupes are grown . Agribusinessman Bill Ramsey oversees fields of cotton and barley , staying in touch with his town office by a mobile telephone . Soil and water expert Jaroy Moore experiments with guayule , a plant that yields natural rubber . And on isolated patches of desert , farmer Frank Carpenter , foreman of the Escondido Vineyard near Bakersfield , takes pride in his white Chenin Blanc . " It 's the most satisfying crop I 've ever worked with , " he told me . " You sort of feel like the first pioneers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " How odd , I thought , that in this barren place not long removed from the Apaches , men nurture French grapes . Other , deeper currents are stirring the Trans-Pecos . Mexican-American influence is on the rise . Six counties now have Hispanic majorities . But the ethnic transformation is less a matter of numbers than of participation ? social , political , and economic -- by people who once stayed on the periphery . The story is carved in stone on a war memorial on the Presidio County Courthouse lawn in Marfa . Of the five who died in World War I , none had Spanish surnames ; in World War II , 20 of 39 did ; in Korea , three of four ; and in Vietnam , three of three . Outwardly , Anglo-Hispanic relations 233  | were relaxed and easygoing . In Fort Stockton , MeMe Arriaga was crowned Homecoming Queen , succeeding Stacie Diebitsch . The cable-television station wished everyone Feliz Halloween . " I am proud I can speak in the Spanish language , " Dudley Harrison 's campaign brochures declared . Casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ) . In Reeves County , genial Sheriff Raul Florez is an improbable Mexican good of boy ? a Mason , a Shriner , a Baptist , a Texas Aggie who played football for Bear Bryant . Eighty-five percent of the voters sent him back for a second term to his memento-lined office where I found him , pistol on hip , flanked by shelves of Texas Criminal Procedure . " People here are very clannish , " he says , pausing now and then to spit tobacco juice into a plastic cup . " You do n't just move in . But once they accept you , you 're just like family . " He had grown up the hard way ? poor , shining shoes to earn a few dimes . " Now the old ranchers come in for a cup of coffee and want my help with a windmill or something . That 's what we call a noncriminal service , and we 'll find a way . These are the people I worked for as a kid . " Many older Anglo families view the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one younger Anglo told me , " provided we 're willing to accept that we 're on somebody else 's turf . " No less momentous than this ethnic shift is the changing ownership of the land . Outside speculators , willing to pay far more than the land 's productive value for ranching in hope that oil may be found there , tempt even old families to trade their pa mony for greenbacks . Since the 1973 A oil embargo , most of Brewster and Presi Counties have passed into the hands of absentee owners . Those who remain wornthat distant investors will care nothing about predator control , or thievery , or tales to support the schools . Until now , the arrival of electricity and the eradication of a cattle pest called the screwworm had done more to raise the standard of living in the Trans-Pecos than all else combined . But now , odd contradictions have begun to sprout in the isolation . Cable TV . Satellite dishes . Computer stores . Remote ranches may vault from the age of radio to the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . One rancher beamed at the prospect of following his few stocks on a home computer that put him on equal footing with a broker on Wall Street . In ten years , I thought , the isolation may be gone , and the deep TransPecos more like the rest of America . In 50 years , though , I was not so sure . I thought of the ghost towns , the ruins of the Hunsaker house I had seen in Madera Canyon , the abandoned adobe shells . Once the tall grass had stretched as far as the eye could see , and the cool springs had run free ; now overgrazing had taken its toll , and many springs were dry . In parts of the TransPecos the white man had already passed across the land like smoke . The civilization of Europe had swept out of the Old World to what it called the New : across the Atlantic and the Appalachians and the swirling Mississippi , planting neat ordered farms on blackland prairies until it beached against these gravelly and forbidding outermost shores . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Madrid 's Redford store .
