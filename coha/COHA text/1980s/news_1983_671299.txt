She has never seen a Jew without a gun. // In the labyrinth of pathways that meander among the cold concrete houses of her slum , a refugee camp that has been under Israeli military occupation since six years before she was born , Amal sees only two kinds of Jews : uniformed soldiers and civilian settlers , usually when they are running through the camp after children who have thrown stones at Israeli cars and buses. // She has never spoken to a Jew . She says she never wants to. // " Do you like Jews ? " she is asked // " No. " // " Why not ? " // " They attack our houses , breaking everything , building settlements. " // Why would she not want to talk with any Jews ? " Because they are our enemies. " // And what is her dream in life ? " To get back our land. " // How ? " Demonstrate .

Urban residents of the West Bank often display less hostility , or at least mask it with sophisticated argument . Arabs inside Israel proper , who are Israeli citizens themselves , are caught in complex ambivalence about the stereotypes they hold. // But those in the Dheisheh camp , just south of Bethlehem , exist behind walls that have become metaphors for their isolation : the concrete barricades that the Israeli Army has recently erected across all the camp ' s exits to the main road to discourage stone-throwers. // Although the 5 , 000 camp residents may leave and enter through a back way , they smile angrily when they call their slum their " ghetto , " relishing the opportunity to turn the language of Jewish suffering against the Jews . <> <> Hatred Seethes Quietly // And within the cloistered alleyways , inside the houses decorated with portraits of Lenin and Che Guevara and the outlawed Palestinian flag , a hatred of the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Israeli Army . Here , future " fedayeen , " or " freedom fighters " for the Palestinian cause are being indoctrinated , both by their elders and by their environment. // Nadir al-Farat , 13 , a boy with a film of hurt across his eyes , likes to throw stones . Jews have tried to talk to him . " Sometimes soldiers call to speak with me , " he says , " but I refuse and run away . " What does he want to be when he grows up ? " Fedayeen , " he says firmly . The young men sitting around him in the room laugh in surprise and approval . Across the pre-1967 border , inside Israel proper , the Arabs who have lived as Israeli citizens since 1948 are generally less militant politically , although they have their prejudices . Some say to each other , " Don ' t behave like a Jew , " by which they mean don ' t be arrogant or stingy. // Common Stereotypes : Violence and Greed // The common stereotypes of Jews held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed , sneakiness , technological superiority and a lack of personal warmth , according to Arabs and Jews who have worked in the Arab communities. // " There is awe of Jews , and envy , " said Peter Schaktman , 23 , an American Jew from Buffalo , N.Y. , who is living in an Arab village as part of Interns for Peace , a program to increase Arab-Jewish contacts and understanding . To many Arabs , who judge by their own standards of effusive hospitality , " Jews are cold , Jews are inhospitable , " Mr. Schaktman said. // Another intern , Susan Bandler , 24 , of New York City , was told by an Arab man her age who became her friend that he could not believe she was Jewish. // Violence is a heavy theme , both in Arab children ' s play and in their images of Jews .

Mr. Schaktman , visiting an Arab home in a Galilee village , said he was asked by a 3-year-old girl , " Did you kill them too ? " // " When you say , ' Jew , ' they immediately think of a violent policeman , " said Khalil Samar , the principal of an elementary and junior high school in Tamra , an Arab village in the Galilee . " If you ask a Jew , ' What do you think of an Arab ? ' they think terrorist or worse.

Here , each side is most vulnerable , and the wounds can be deep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive around in a Jeep and go into discos in Tiberius , " said Samir Sabag , an Arab builder from a small village in the northern Galilee . His Hebrew was so fluent and his appearance such that many Jews thought he was Jewish . He used to like to dance with " soldier girls , " he recalled , Jewish women in the Israeli Army. // " Once I was dancing with a girl soldier , " he said , " and she heard me speaking Arabic to a friend . She said , ' What ? You ' re an Arab ? I won ' t dance with you ! I can ' t dance with you ! ' She backed away. // " I said : ' You ' re not dancing with an Arab . You ' re dancing with a person .

" I could never have said that to her about her Jewishness . " Still , Mr. Endrawos laces his political views with a fiery pride and bitterness. // " In general , " he said , " Arabs are afraid of Jewish things - anything that ' s Jewish , they ' re afraid of . The education I received from my mother was to walk next to the wall and not cause any problems .

Despite his fluent Hebrew , she guessed he was an Arab , did not mind and confronted him with the fact . He had been afraid to admit it . <> <> Arab Women More Restricted // Virtually all such relations , including mixed marriages , occur between Arab men and Jewish women , since Arab women are mostly prevented from dating by the conservative traditions of their society . One exception - the daughter of an Arab Christian family in Haifa - told recently of her rejection by both Arabs and Jews as she was educated in Jewish schools , learned to read and write Arabic at a Jewish university , spent time with Jews and fell in love with a Jewish man. // " My fellow Palestinian students ostracized me , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whore because I socialized with Jews and probably thought I was sleeping with most of them.

One day , she said , his Jewish friends got together with some Arab students and beat him up. // Both his parents and hers resolutely opposed marriage , leaving her caught between two cultures . " I don ' t know if it would have been good , " she said . " I don ' t know . But with an Arab boy it definitely won ' t work . Now I ' m 28 . I know that for an Arab boy , my stock has gone down . He can be crazy for me . His family won ' t go along with it.

" The Jewish arrogance is completely different from the Palestinian arrogance , " he contended . Palestinians are willing to do any work to get ahead , he said . " The Jewish arrogance was the product of a very mysterious thing : ' We are the chosen people . ' It ' s an old business. // " Part of the Jewish arrogance is the inferiority complex , " Mr. Hamad continued . " They are exporting a Jewishness to the Palestinians .

" // Of all the images of Jews that Arabs possess , the one that ignites the deepest fury among Israeli Jews is the parallel some Arabs draw between Jews and Nazis , the argument that what the Nazis did to the Jews , the Jews now do to the Palestinians. // Arabs Widely Ignorant Of the Nazi Horror // In some measure , this comes out of genuine ignorance among Arabs about the Nazi horror inflicted on European Jews ; children on the West Bank learn nothing about it in school , and even Israeli Arabs do not seem to absorb the lessons they get . Miss Bandler , of Interns for Peace , said she knew a militant young Arab who used to equate Israeli Jews with Nazis until he went to a small museum on a kibbutz founded by survivors of the Warsaw ghetto. // " He was very moved to see what Jews had suffered , " she said .

Referring to former Prime Minister Menachem Begin , he added : " When Begin said about us - animals on two feet - doesn ' t it bring an echo of what Hitler said about the Jews ?
