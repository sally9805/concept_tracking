Professor Lydia Glaser Dept. of Music George Washington University Washington , D.C. Cleveland October 5 , 1981 Dear Professor Glaser : I am an aging part-time graduate student at the Cleveland Institute of Art , or ( I prefer this version ) a young independent scholar-critic working in the arts . I make my living by other means . For years I have been circling around Stravinsky , and this summer 1 found your essay , " Seeing and Hearing Stravinsky , " in the collection Stravinsky Revisited . May I send you a thirty-page article of my own , which has grown out of a course in twentieth-century performance arts ? Your comments would be of great help to me , and I hope to submit the article for publication . I believe the subject will interest you . Sincerely yours , Pat Cartnell Dept. of Music George Washington University Washington , D.C. October 15 , 1981 Dear Mr. Cartnell : Please excuse me if I should write " Ms. Cartnell . " The name Pat is ambiguous , and your fetter gives no clues to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twentieth-century performance arts might cover and what you have written about . Nevertheless , try to make some comment on your article if you This essay was delivered at the International Stravinsky Festival at the University of California , San Diego , in September 1982 . Roger Shattuck teaches literature at the University of Virginia . He is the author , most recently , of The Forbidden Experiment : The Story of The Wild Boy of Aveyron ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ) . send it . It may be a little while before I can read it . Sincerely , Lydia Glaser Cleveland November 10 , 1981 Dear Professor Glaser : I 'm male , Patrick . Sorry . I rarely write to strangers . Your letter gave me pause . You sound very busy and a little dubious about reading thirty pages on an undivulged subject . I decided to drop the whole idea . Then last night I reread your article and got excited enough to change my mind again . But instead of asking you to read my article I 'll summarize my ideas as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , as you see , I 'm typing . It 's a curious situation . Since you are the principal scholar whose work I refer to and build on , you should have no trouble understanding what I want to say . At the same time you are probably the last person I should write to , because in a way I 'm attacking you . I have no competence as a trained musician or musicologist . But I have spent a large pie-shaped piece of my free time in the past seven or eight years listening to Stravinsky recordings plus all local concerts , and by now I 've read a good part of what has been written by or about him . Still , I 'm an amateur . For some reason Stravinsky 's work and Stravinsky 's presence as an almost monstrous mind draw me more forcefully than any other artist ? painter or writer ? of this century . I 'm trying to find out why . After all , I 'm supposed to be in the visual arts . It 's Saturday morning here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is , to this letter . I admire your article because you find something all Stravinsky scholars know perfectly well but have neglected , and you make it obvious . The quotes can not be dismissed . It is " not enough to hearmusic . . . it must also be seen . " I had forgotten the " fleeting vision " and all the visual imagery that Stravinsky tells us inspired the composition of Rite of Spring . It 's wonderful the way you demonstrate how S. participated actively with Nijinsky to work out the original choreography for the Rite along with the music . What you say about S. 's insisting on placing the musicians on stage for Histoire du soldat and Les Noces could be developed a lot more . That 's the aspect that caught my attention in connection with performance arts . How could vou leave out the wonderful quote from the Autobiography ? " I wanted all my instrumental apparatus to be visible side by side with the actors or dancers , making it , so to speak , a participant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eye Musk " passage from Themes and Episodes that you must know . " To see Balanchine 's choreography of the Movements is to hear the music with one 's eves ; and this visual hearing has been a greater revelation to me , I think , than to anyone else . " I even have two more examples for you ? the importance of two-dimensional Japanese prints for the conception of the Japanese Lyrics of 1912 , and S. noting choreographic ideas in the manuscript score while composing Agon . The visual inspiration was often there , and you make us sit up and take notice of it . Of course someone could question what the role of the visual was ? is ? in vocal works like Pribaoutki , Renard , Symphony of Psalms , Cantata . And there 's something constricting , incomplete , in any attempt to concentrate the appeal of stage works on the visual . The visual image distances and locates our experience in space outside us , whereas the auditory distributes it throughout space and carries it deep into our listening mind . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an alert eye , maybe a compulsive eye . Now I 'm going to try to go beyond you , thanks in great part to what you 've shown me . One of my sources is Stravinsky , in Pictures and Documents , a wonderful , undigested mishmash of information on the man and his music . I finally had to buy a copy . After this free-form performance , I 'll wager Craft never tries a sit-down biography . He does n't have to . But I 'm getting off the subject . I 'll begin ad hominem . Look at the descriptions of S. playing the piano , not in concert but in rehearsal or in private . The written record goes back at least to Firebird . In her little memoir on Stravinsky , Karsavina recalls how he played her part for her over and over before rehearsals . " His body seemed to vibrate with his own rhythm ; punctuating staccatos with his head , he made the pattern of his music forcibly clear to me , more so than the counting of bars would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his body . . . . " He played a two-hand reduction of Sacre for Diaghilev and Monteux in 1912 , a session that Monteux later described . " Before he got very far , I was convinced he was raving mad . . . . The very walls resounded as Stravinsky pounded away , occasionally stamping his feet and jumping up and down . . . . " He played with equal vehemence at early rehearsals according to Marie Rambert . " Hearing the way his music was being played , Stravinsky blazed up , pushed aside the fat German pianist ... and proceeded to play twice as fast as we had been doing and twice as fast as we could possibly dance . He stamped his feet on the floor and banged his fist on the piano and sang and shouted . . . . " In 1914 Diaghilev took the composer to a meeting in Milan of futurist and bruitist musicians . According to the sculptor Cangiullo , S. felt far from left out . He " leaped from the divan like an exploding bedspring , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Rustler rustled . . . . The frenetic composer hurled himself on the piano in an attempt to find that ... sound . " Elliott Carter 's version of S. 's " electricity-filled piano playing " in the ' 30s catches the same effects barely tempered by twenty years . Carter speaks of " the very telling quality of attack he gave to piano notes , " of " intensity " and " extraordinary dynamism " even in the soft passages . There must be scores of such descriptions . Stravinsky was a man of enormous physical energy . Do you know the 1924 photograph of him doing his daily set of Swedish-German gymnastics ? A musical psycho-archeologist could reconstruct all his music from that one image . He was always in training , acutely aware of his physical condition . It may be the natural attitude toward life of a midget who had become a conductor and a star . Ansermet says somewhere that S. 's morning calisthenics could become highly competitive and relates how the tiny composer tried to wrestle him to the floor when they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find it much harder to locate believable accounts of S. 's physical behavior while conducting . Apparently in public performance his movements were fairly restrained and concentrated . Some observers considered him mechanical . Toscanini was shocked to hear him counting aloud . But the best firsthand accounts of his rehearsals ? by Paul Rosenfeld , by a Vienna journalist , by Emile Vuillermoz , and by a Belgian critic in 1924 ? all emphasize the nervous , imperious dynamism of his movements . It 's incredible . They all use exactly the same verb for him : dance . Rosenfeld 's famous article-interview is still one of the best . " He commenced singing the words in Russian , even danced a little in his pink sweater up on the conductor 's stand . . . . His arms at all times mimed the rhythmic starts and jerks , till one could actually perceive where his music came from . " That says it all . S. once ridiculed an overly demonstrative conductor by comparing the performance to " a belly dance seen from behind . " In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical postures of conducting recapitulate and even extend the process of composition . Here 's a 1930 interview : " I have the impression that only in conducting his own works does a composer feel the fullest blossoming of his temperament . To realize the composition that one has conceived gives an incomparable pleasure . " Those are not the words of a man who conducted only for the fee and the glory . I believe his statement ? above all as it applies to him . Sorry . This summary of my article is coming out all quotes . They 're the best part . You must see what I 'm driving at . I find it even more obvious than your demonstration about the visual . S. com-posed with his whole body , not just with his enormous ears and his sharp eyes . ( He even said ear and eye get in each other 's way . Remember ? ) This son of a famous opera singer loved amateur theatricals before he loved the piano . In 1924 he improved on Ramuz 's descrip-tion of him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interprete ne ) . I think it 's essential to understand that S. 's mu-sic emanates from a whole dancing body , his own . Look at the dancing bear in Petrushka . In one performance I saw the bear lead the whole ensemble . A metaphor for Stravinsky conducting . Now , I have n't really parted company with you . You just did n't go far enough with your visual thesis . The corporal is right there in the same passages you quote , but you have to read on . In the Autobiography you quote the section where S. speaks about the " vision " and the " picture " that seemed to provide the theme of the Sacre . A few pages later he refers to deciding with Roerich on the " visual embodiment " of the episodes . You underline visual ; I underline body . He 's correcting himself . And here 's your other key quotation . " I have always had a horror of listening to music with my eyes shut , with nothing for them to do . " But you stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself again . " The sight of the gestures and movements of the various parts of the body producing the music is fundamentally necessary if it is to be grasped in its fullness . " Body again , and always , no ? In the Poetics where he talks about " seeing " music , he makes it clear that he is referring to the physical performance , the gestures of dancers and instrumentalists . It 's frustrating to discover that S. has said it all . He talked too much and too well for our own good . There 's nothing left to do but collate . He wrote my conclusion , and you must know the passage as well as I do . A month after the Petrushka premiere , in midcomposition of Sacre , he already foresaw his whole career and described it in a letter to Rimsky-Korsakov 's son . I consider this S. 's only true manifesto . Every word counts . " I believe that if some Michelangelo were alive today ? so it occurred to me , looking at the frescoes in the Sistine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recognize is choreography . . . Not until I had worked in choreography did I realize this , as well as the necessity and value of what I am doing . " Amen . Sincerely yours , Patrick Cartnell Washington November 20 , 1981 Dear Mr. Cartnell : Thank you for sending a lively six-page letter instead of a thirty-page article . I read it straight through standing by the mailboxes and have just read it again , carefully . Your knowledge of Stravinsky impresses me very much . I hope you can continue your work and your concern with performance , the role of the body , and their relation to music . There is a sentence near the beginning of his Poetics , in which Stravinsky defines music as ordered sound that comes from " the integral man . " Is n't that what you 're saying ? You begin your letter by asking for my comments . The evidence you collect makes a very strong case for the physical and corporal side of his inspiration . Possibly it was stronger than the visual side . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're right about his intense physical presence . People have described him as everything from a leprechaun to a champion cyclist . But something in all this makes me very uneasy . I 'm at fault as much as you and I may be partly to blame . Both of us rely almost entirely on written sources by and about Stravinsky , and pay little attention to the music itself . We mention a few titles , but neither of us analyzes any musical examples . I talk about Stravinsky 's collaborations with great visual artists like Benois and Bakst and Gontcharova and Picasso and Larionov . You have hunted through Stravinsky , in Pictures and Documents and other books with infinite patience and found lots of quotes . But it all seems speculative , bookish , the thoughts of someone who came to the music through the life and writings . Do you know Stravinsky 's music as well as you know the books ? You were right to think that I might be your best and your worst reader . Your article is probably worth publishing , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the physicality of Stravinsky 's music . That 's helpful , but also superficial and inadequate . The intrinsic evidence would mean much more . Can you show that Stravinsky 's work is consistently more corporal , of the whole body , than Debussy 's or Prokovieff 's ? Schoenberg 's or Bartok 's ? I 'll go a long way with you , but there 's one aspect of Stravinsky 's music that remains essentially visual for me . That is his tendency to compose without transitions , by abrupt juxtapositions and interruptions . Stravinsky himself refers to " cutting off the fugue with a pair of scissors . " In my article 1 discuss this abruptness in relation to cubism and primitivism in France just before World War I. Within careful limits it makes sense to refer to Sacre and Histoiresoldat and Les Noces and even many late compositions as " cubist . " Motifs are jammed together and overlayed in a fashion I find visual , and the driving pulse of most of the music emphasizes the effect . Perhaps you will want to answer some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only challenging response I have had to my article . Most people said nice things and went about their business . My work does n't threaten anyone , I guess . Thank you again , in any case , for writing . I 'm afraid I 've offered you very little useful comment . Sincerely yours , Lydia Glaser Cleveland December 2 , 1981 Dear Ms. Glaser : The bookish nature of the letter I wrote you can not be blamed on the evil influence of your article . I 'm a dilettante who can barely read music and therefore I did n't dare attempt any musical discussions . But the way I first grasped the corporal nature of Stravinsky 's music was by listening to it over and over again . The reading came afterwards , in order to transformer ma volupte en connaissance . ( In art history we have to know our Baudelaire . I suppose you must know this quote from his essay on Wagner . ) So now I 'll have to start all over again from the beginning and convince you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the played notes . I 'll pick a piece I know well , L'Histoire du Soldat . Let 's forget what people have said about it ? S. himself , Ramuz , Ansermet , and everyone else ? even though the original itinerant theater conception is marvelous , and the way it grew . The first three measures say everything . A brisk cornet call to launch us on a regular walking pulse that will keep coming back . The phrasing and the instrumentation in those measures sound both military and circusy ? like fairgrounds music . It involves a very odd sideslip into the key of G. How would you analyze it ? I ca n't . I hear it as a physical summons to a performance , to start walking , to find some spring and verve in our bodies . Nothing visual here , rather two insistent and coherent lines directed more toward provoking bodily movement than toward establishing a tonal center . There 's a section in Adorno 's book where he works himself up to assassinate " the schizoid dispersion of aesthetic functions " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that mean ? But Adorno still had a sensibility behind his crass prejudices and talks about " passages in which the ' melody ' is bypassed , in order that it might appear in the actual leading voice ? in bodily movement on the stage . " That 's far from stupid . S. composes music here to galvanize everyone into action . Or take the music that forms a complete contrast in the same piece , the two Chorales near the end . To my ear it 's the most successful counterpoint S. ever wrote , with fermatas held until you think it 's all finished and it has n't . The slowly wheeling harmonies wo n't allow the tension to drop . They create the feeling of plenitude , of life completely realized , of an almost superhuman condition . To me it 's a sustained instrumental gesture , yes , a chorale for all our voices rejoicing with arms outstretched and necks straining . Personal associations ? Perhaps . But I do n't think so . You can not hear the Great Chorale without experiencing a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all corporal . Of course he breaks it off with the devil 's dance . And there 's the crux . Do you know about the ending ? It 's in Ramuz 's letters . An actor and a dancer alternated in the devil 's role . In rehearsal neither one could begin to produce the wild jerky energetic movements S. and Ramuz wanted for the last Triumphal March . Solution ? Stravinsky would do it himself ! Stravinsky on stage as devil dancing to his own music ! Ramuz agreed enthusiastically , asked others to encourage the composer , and wrote to S. urgently . " Dance that last scene yourself ; you 'll live it rhythmically and you 'll save everything . " Before conducting offered him an appropriate ( and lucrative ) outlet , S. showed signs of a Moli ? re syndrome , the desire to write and direct performances in which he would perform himself . That little tidbit about S. almost dancing the devil 's role in Histoire du SoMat sums up his entire corporal genius . Can you hear the Octet without sensing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in terms of bodily movement suggested by , reached through those sounds ? I have n't seen Jerome Robbins 's choreography ; I 'm told it 's wonderfully inventive and witty . After a while I hear almost every thing S. wrote that way ? I do n't mean foot-tapping or some kind of routine body language , such as ballet can become at its worst . S. composed to reveal the expressive resources of the body . Take the opening of Symphonies for Wind Instruments . A friend of mine calls it " eerie lyric . " Yes . But f begin to hear it as another summons , like Histoire , to action ? the torso twisted , legs slowly tensing and releasing , a contortion , but not painful . The end of Les Noces takes the opposite position . Those slow-flowing measures of counted silence punctuated by chimed beats spaced out to the limits of our capacity for time perception ? Stravinsky wrote an extended , shimmering , precise , perpetual-motion device that leads us out finally onto a plateau of pure silence . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard almost backwards , I think , as one prolonged , convoluted cadence announced at rehearsal number 58 or at least by 80 and going on and on like a hundredfold amen . The insistent physicality of the music carries us to an ultimate repose , quietness and silence as forms of expression , calm after the storm . lust reread what I 've written , I should n't send it . Why do you put up with my rantings ? Possibly I know the answer . I got a surprise when I looked you up in Who 's Who and did n't find you . I had to go to the Directory of American Scholars , latest edition , to find out that you 're younger than I am ! I first imagined you as a white-haired senior scholar with the authority and appearance of Nadia Boulanger . In the Directory there 's no photograph beside your short entry to fill the newly created void . Cordially , Patrick Cartnell Washington December 11 , 1981 Dear Mr. Cartnell : White hair , you thought ! Sorry to disappoint you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm an assistant professor . Now you know the truth . Are you angling for a photograph ? This will be short . I have several impossibly busy weeks ahead of me . I want to answer you before the sky falls in . Three points . ( 1 . ) You 're right of course . Stravinsky was a dance musician with a choreographic imagination . But not exclusively . You know about his near menage a trois in the ' 20s and ' 30s . Musically he kept a menage a trente-six , or maybe 1001 . Take the Histoire . It 's almost all dances , some of his most inventive . But what holds it together ? The Chorales , not for the reasons you suggest however . All the driving ragtime and tango and marching frame the near immobility of the Great Chorale which in turn guards the secret place , the tabernacle of the composition that keeps its holy emblem . Have you heard the Oubradous recording with French actors reading the script ? At rehearsal number 3 in the Chorale after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counterpoint ) , the six instruments hold a fermata on a D chord with the seventh doubled , and Jean Marchat 's unhurried , worldly-wise voice says the words . They have to be in French . As I see it , hear it , Stravinsky wrote Histoire to house those words . They deserve it . He felt them deeply , personally . The Great Chorale corresponds to the pure time sequence at the end of Les Noces . Still , neither of us can generalize from these examples . S. had no one overriding preoccupation . The quotations get confusing . " What survives every change of system is melody . " Other times his chief concern does seem to be note against note counterpoint . A critic would not be wrong to claim that no twentieth-century composer has been so single-mindedly devoted to extending the rhythmic resources of our musical language . Or that S. composed most consistently and brilliantly on syllables , words reduced to nonsense noises in five languages . You say the body and choreography . Yes ? and more . ( 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . The only works you refer to belong to the period before 1940 , before the Rake , before S. began trying out serial techniques . I do n't believe you could do so well looking for the corporal aspects of the Cantata , or even of the specifically dance pieces like Movements and The Flood . In other words is n't your hypothesis an indirect way of attaching a higher value to his pre-serial works ? This means slighting some of his greatest music . Your idea about the importance of the physical is enlightening but partial . ( 3 . ) I think that the corporal aspect of S. 's pre-serial music that you find so appealing has to do with his stretching and distorting the pulse , and doing it in such a way as to emphasize its underlying presence . It 's no accident that your favorite Histoire ends with battering percussion , the pitch bled out , and the pulse all powerful . It seems , if I follow your argument , that you are equating lack of strong rhythmic feel with cerebral music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so busy for the rest of the month is that I 'm organizing a conference here for next year to honor Stravinsky 's centenary . Most ofthe old-timers and vested scholars and official companions have been very sweet to me and say they come . It 's really a miracle . I also want to bring in some new blood . Would you do a brief presentation on S. and performance for one of the panels ? I suppose I should know more about you before inviting you . Well , now that I 've done it , please send me a curriculum vitae . I do n't need a photograph . After this conference 1 will have white hair . Yours , Lydia Glaser Cleveland January 4 , 1982 Dear Lydia Glaser : You have my full permission to retract the invitation to your conference before I accept it . The enclosed curriculum vitae , drawn up for your sole benefit , will inform you that I have no advanced degrees , have dabbled in painting , scenery design , and art history , and remain unattached at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airline steward and work alternate weeks . Not a bad living . In other words , no credentials , no publications , no connections ? except this exchange of letters with you . The article on Stravinsky I originally wrote you about is really a project , the figment of a dallying imagination . It is coming into being through these letters . Conclusion : part imposter . A few final remarks . ( " Final " for reasons I 'll explain in a moment . ) Yesterday I reread by " chance " Craft 's journal notes for March 31 , 1948 . He contrasts a physically disheveled Auden little interested in his meal with the slightly dandified S. savoring his Chateaubriand and his glass of Ch ? teau Margaux . Then this sentence . " While with Auden the senses seemed to be of negligible importance , with Stravinsky the affective faculties were virtual instruments of thought . " May I rest my case ? The contrast is too neat , probably . But it 's another version of what I 've been trying to say about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For me his pre-serial compositions ? this will sound pretentious and literary , but here goes ? his pre-serial compositions accomplish a reassociation of sensibility , favor the thinking body , the choreographic imagination , have the order and sense of limits that allow reason and feeling to fuse . T. S. Eliot kept talking about this fusion , and our lack of it today . He deplored our " dissociation of sensibility . " In poetry , Eliot said , we have come to want all feeling and suggestiveness , and no conceptual thought . Has n't the opposite happened in music ? It 's becoming more cerebral than corporal . Is that a prejudiced opinion ? I know that there are neoprimitive composers around like Crumb and Berio . But even a popular composer like Glass with all his endless repetitions and variations strikes me as basically cerebral . He 's working out a concept of music , an extended set of intellectual patterns , not giving us the discoveries of a wonderfully sensitive ear or body . Perhaps the quality of S. 's music that unifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just do n't hear it . I do n't dislike Tomorrow I go off for a two-week vacation that will , if my plans work out , take me as far as India and Ceylon . It 's my reward for working steadily through the holidays . As a steward with some seniority , I have great travel privileges . On the way back via Egypt , Paris , and Dulles may I take you out to dinner on Thursday , January 21 ? Well , this letter wo n't reach you before I leave . I 'll send it anyway and call you tonight for an answer . At least I 'll hear the sound of your voice . A musician 's photograph . A bientOt ?
