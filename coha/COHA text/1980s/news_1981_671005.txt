But this weekend and next week sees the coincidental and competitive , pairing of two important Latin festivals designed to showcase this music not only for its own audiences but also for non-Latin aficionados . Tonight and Sunday will be the second and last shows of the 1981 Latin American Jazz Festival , a new venture . Starting next Wednesday and continuing through Labor Day , there will be El Festival Latino Kool . This is an expanded version of the New York Salsa Festival , now in its sixth year . This year the format is being modeled on the former Newport in New York , now Kool Jazz Festival. // There haven ' t always been millions of Latins in New York and this country as a whole . But Latin music has a long history of interaction with mainstream American musical culture , which has been expertly chronicled in " The Latin Tinge , " a book by John Storm Roberts . The Latin countries that have made the principal impact on the United States are Cuba , Brazil , Argentina and Mexico . Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fidel Castro ' s Government , but now on the rise again - has been the most decisive , and much of Puerto Rican salsa is based on Cuban models. // Latin influences can be traced well back into the 19th century . Louis Moreau Gottschalk , for instance , spent time in the Caribbean and composed Latin-flavored numbers . Tin Pan Alley and Broadway have long been alive to Latin music , and Vernon and Irene Castle led this country ' s tango craze in the teens . That craze was followed by similar enthusiasms for the rumba and the mambo . Such pop and novelty entertainers as Xavier Cugat , Carmen Miranda , Desi Arnaz , Yma Sumac and Perez Prado kept Americans dancing to Latin rhythms . Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made " Flying Down to Rio " in 1933 . And such composers as George Gershwin and Aaron Copland were inspired by Latin influences . But the most profound Latin impact on American music came in the 1940 ' s , with the advent of Latin jazz . This was the time of bop music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cubop . " The leading practitioners were Stan Kenton , Dizzy Gillespie and the singer and percussionist Frank Grillo , who is known as Machito . Charlie Parker played with Machito and recorded his own Latin jazz albums. // Latin jazz was , first of all , the spicing up of jazz with the rhythms and colors of Latin music . A more fundamental kind of fusion pitted the relatively rigid and traditional Cuban and Puerto Rican dances and song structures against the improvisatory freedom of jazz . Latin music is dance music , based on the " clave , " which is a blend of double and triple rhythms extending over two bars . The clave provides the kinetic undercurrent of Latin music . But if it is retained by a jazz musician , it also shapes his playing in unaccustomed ways . The result can stifle or focus jazz creativity . <> <> This Weekend a Potpourri // This weekend ' s Latin American Jazz Festival is something of a potpourri , with artists of a greater and lesser connection to recognizable Latin jazz traditions . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society . The society underwrites activities for young blacks and Hispanic people . Sunday night ' s concert , which is a high-price gala , is particularly loose in its application of formal guidelines , but tonight ' s has its oddities , too. // Chief among the peculiarities of tonight ' s concert , at the Beacon Theater at 8 , is the presence of Ornette Coleman , whose links to Latin music seem minimal , especially with his new , funk-oriented band , Prime Time . Still , Mr. Coleman , who has only recently reemerged into public performance , is a remarkable musician and well worth hearing in any context . Others on tonight ' s bill include the progressive Afro-Cuban group Libre , led by the percussionist Manny Orquendo and featuring the saxophonist Jackie McClean , and the Cuban alto saxophonist Paquito d ' Rivera ' s New York/ Havana Jazz Quint t , with Chico Freeman. // The Sunday gala , at 8 P.M. in Avery Fisher Hall , offers Tito Puente , the percussionist often referred to as " the king of Latin music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Willie Bobo , a charismatic salsa-jazzman , and the Duke Ellington Orchestra . There will also be guest appearances by Chita Rivera and by Gregory Hines , who will do numbers from " Sophisticated Ladies . " <> <> El Festival Latino Events // El Festival Latino Kool offers Mr. Puente and Ray Barretto . The festival begins Wednesday at Ochentas , 2540 Broadway , at 95th Street , and continues with a Barretto-Eddie Palmieri concert at Fisher Hall and a show at the Elegante Nightclub in Fairview , N.J. , next Thursday ; a Hudson River cruise next Friday ; the annual Madison Square Garden event next Saturday ; two shows on Sept. 6 in New York and New Jersey , and two more shows on Labor Day at the Village Gate and the Corso , the traditional Manhattan home of Latin music. // Tickets for tonight ' s Beacon Theater show of the Latin American Jazz Festival , which is being presented by Sergio Valente jeans , cost $8. 50 to $15 , and the box office number is 874-1717 .
