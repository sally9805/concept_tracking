Today , Robert C. Maynard is owner , publisher , and editor of a well-known West Coast daily - the Oakland Tribune. // A high school dropout from Brooklyn , N.Y. , who in the early 1960s became one of the first blacks to pierce the hiring barriers of the white daily press , Mr. Maynard recently became the first black owner of a metropolitan daily in the United States . He purchased majority stock in the Tribune from the Gannett Company for $22 million. // With optimism that , considering his past experience , is not surprising , Maynard rejects arguments that the task of reviving the Trib ' s flagging fortunes might be too much for his triple-threat talents . Admitting that the paper has suffered identity problems in recent years and has been through particularly tough times in recent months , Maynard said in an interview , ' ' Though to some , the future of the Tribune was in doubt , it never was in my mind. ' ' // Founded in 1874 , the Tribune was purchased by Joseph R. Knowland in 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the family to run the paper was the late William F. Knowland , a Republican US senator from California from 1945 to 1959 . Reflecting the political conservatism of the Knowlands , the Tribune in recent decades had become more and more detached from the city ' s growing black and Hispanic population . In 1979 the Gannett chain bought the Tribune from Combined Communications Corporation . Because it is in the process of acquiring KRON-TV in San Francisco , just across the bay , Gannett was forced by government antimonopoly regulations to dispose of the Oakland newspaper. // Maynard , who was hired as the Tribune ' s editor in 1979 and added the title of publisher in 1981 , negotiated new employee agreements , making work-rule changes and salary adjustments beneficial to management . And he obtained the financial backing of the Canadian Commercial Bank , Crocker National Bank of San Francisco , and the Gannett Corporation to make the purchase. // Among the local and national community leaders Maynard recruited for his board of directors are Shirley Temple Black of Woodside , Calif. , the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haley , the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ' ' Roots. ' ' // ' ' Now that we ' ve got all our ducks in row - got the paper well financed , we will get it reorganized , ' ' says Maynard . ' ' Our circulation ' s at about 175 , 000 , our ( advertising ) lineage is improving as the economy improves , and we ' re very close to break-even . From there , becoming profitable is just a matter of doing the fundamentals . We ' ve got some areas where we have to work hard , but I feel it ' s doable . I think our future ' s quite secure. ' ' // Maynard ' s skills as a salesman , negotiator , and manager were severely tested in working out the Tribune reorganization and purchase . Union contracts were crucial. // ' ' Our labor costs would have sunk us at the old level , without some ability to freeze wages and get back some operational control . ' ' The negotiations involved editorial as well as production workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract , which included an employee profit-sharing plan . Staffers ratified the contract by nearly a 9-to-1 margin , Maynard says. // There were no pay cuts , just a freeze , he explains , and most personnel cuts are being achieved through attrition. // ' ' We didn ' t have much of what you might call ' featherbedding ' ( people doing unnecessary tasks ) , but we had to be able to staff according to our needs to a much greater degree than we used to be able to do. ' ' // Proving that things are doable is a lifelong habit for Maynard . The youngest child in a family of six children ( three boys and three girls ) , he was the only one who didn ' t go to college. // The Maynards lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn , where the father had a trucking business . Dinner-table conversation was not only lively , it was competitive , according to Maynard . Young Bob , four years junior to his nearest sibling , had difficulty keeping up. // ' ' I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not long after , my father , who dealt in surplus goods , acquired a used Underwood typewriter . ' ' Eight-year-old Bob claimed it , and ' ' that ' s how I began writing . I imagined myself somewhere between Langston Hughes and Ernest Hemingway , ' ' he recalls , ' ' sometimes poetic , sometimes trenchant reporting. ' ' // ' ' One Friday night , the dinner-table repartee was fast , even raucous . ' ' Taking advantage of a rare break , Bob read a short piece he had written . It was followed , he remembers , ' ' by profound silence . My mother said , ' So , you ' re going to be the writer . ' No one in my family expected me to be anything else after that. ' ' // At age 16 , Maynard ' ' concluded I knew so well what I wanted to do that it was a waste of time to be in high school . So I began cutting classes and hanging around at a little weekly newspaper . ' ' Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending more and more time at the newspaper and less and less at school . Finally , I was totally into the newspaper operation. // At 19 , he moved into a room in Greenwich Village in Manhattan and ' ' went into business as a writer . ' ' It was 1956 , and Maynard was pounding out free-lance articles on his old Underwood typewriter. // ' ' When I couldn ' t earn money from writing , I would do odd jobs - service , sales . . . . I ' d keep sending clips ( of articles he ' d had published ) out to daily papers , ' ' Maynard recalls , ' ' and at first I wouldn ' t indicate my race . That got me a few interviews. ' ' // But no job offers . ' ' One guy said I was good enough to cover suburbs , but the people just wouldn ' t be able to talk to me and I wouldn ' t be able to understand them . Another said his publisher would shoot him if he hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that sounded any good , I ' d write the editor . Then I met Jim Higgins , editor of the York , Pennsylvania , Gazette . Heard him speak and introduced myself afterward . He invited me to write something . He used it , interviewed me , and gave me a job. ' ' // It was 1960 when Maynard joined the staff of the small daily in south-central Pennsylvania. // ' ' I did everything ' ' in the way of reporting , he recalls , ' ' and loved it. ' ' // In 1965 , Mr. Higgins encouraged Maynard to seek a Nieman fellowship at Harvard University , and in 1966 he was selected for the one-year study grant coveted by American reporters . The largely self-educated Maynard used it to fill gaps in his learning , taking courses in ' ' economics , art and music history , and other areas. ' ' // After the Nieman year , he spent one more year in York , as night city editor , then accepted a reporting job at the Washington Post . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sun in the 10 years I was there. ' ' // Maynard was able to help other young blacks break into the profession , as well . Fred Friendly , former CBS News executive , had established a summer training program for budding black journalists at Columbia University in New York . He recruited Maynard as a part-time instructor in 1972 and ' ' it was a tremendous experience . It just made me feel great to see these people who started out not knowing even what a lead was , and in 11 weeks have them writing good stories. ' ' // Other established black journalists took turns working in the Columbia program , but in 1974 the university decided it could no longer afford to continue it . However , the small group of blacks who had conducted the summer sessions refused to quit. // Maynard and others raised $500 , 000 , got newspaper grants for students , and found a new home at the University of California at Berkeley . The first session was held at Berkeley in the summer of 1976 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Maynard as chairman . Later , an editing program was established at the University of Arizona in Tucson. // The institute , says Maynard , ' ' is by far the single largest source of minorities entering the field of journalism . One-quarter of all new minority journalists hired last year came out of institute programs. ' ' // Some of those new journalists have been hired by the Oakland Tribune , which faces its own version of a challenge common to metropolitan daily newspapers : how to simultaneously serve an inner city with heavy minority population and the mostly white suburbs in its circulation area. // ' ' There ' s still a market for us in the ' white ' suburbs of Contra Costa County and southern Alameda County , ' ' Maynard says , as well as closer-in and more ethnically diverse cities such as Richmond , Berkeley , and Hayward . ' ' We ' re the big metro paper covering the East Bay. ' ' // ' ' The Trib had good circulation in the 1950s and ' 60s . When Bill Knowland came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his solution was to reduce the paper ' s presence in the suburbs . It wasn ' t a very smart thing to do . Population was going up in those areas , and our circulation was going down. ' ' // Maynard concedes the area south of Hayward to the aggressive San Jose Mercury-News , but says the Tribune can ' ' do well ' ' on the east side of the bay against the San Francisco Chronicle , ' ' because they don ' t cover the East Bay and lot of other things as well as we think we do now or will be doing. ' ' // What of the sometimes-volatile political and social atmosphere in Oakland and its next-door neighbor Berkeley ? // ' ' Berkeley and Oakland are very diverse communities , ' ' Maynard points out . ' ' One of the problems here is that the media have tended to overemphasize the radicalism of Berkeley without talking about the stable and traditional parts of that city . We try to be more balanced about that and make sure we cover all elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on residential patterns in major cities issued by the privately run Citizens ' Commission on Civil Rights , Maynard said : ' ' There ' s a good reason why Oakland comes out in the study as being the most integrated city in America . The people who have had something to say in the last decade about this city - whether they were business people , political figures , in schools , or whatever - have worked hard for successful intergroup relations . . . . This community has learned to live with the notion that mutual respect is the way to achieve the greatest prosperity , harmony , and so forth. // ' ' That doesn ' t mean we ' ve done it without fights . We ' re like every other place in America , but we ' re almost unique in one respect that I know of : In very few cities in America is there a continuous attempt to address the needs of the whole community . Whether it ' s this newspaper , or city hall , or whatever it may be , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we feel about life . And whatever group is sponsoring something , they will make certain that they touch base with all the other elements in the community . And that ' s the way I think we will show the rest of urban America that you can do it. // ' ' Racism has been a dreadful poison in our society , and we ' ve seen cities just ruined by it . Racial polarism was so great that once it looked like the blacks could control the ballot box , the whites just fled the place . That hasn ' t happened in Oakland . There was some white flight in the ' 50s , but there ' s in-migration now , and I suspect there will be more in the future . I also suspect it will not be just the in-migration of young , white professionals . There will be in-migration of minority professionals , and this mixture is going to continue to be the reality of this community . I think for sure we will see a great contribution to the health and growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems in a realistic way instead of neglecting them. ' ' // //
