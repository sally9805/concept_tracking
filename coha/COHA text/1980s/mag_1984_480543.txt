UNION politics as practiced by the Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) often looks to a baffled outsider like comic opera ? or a TV sitcom that 's headed for mid-season cancellation . But that 's what we expect from Hollywood . What is a little surprising is that SAG 'S recent history ? the controversies that have rocked it since the 1980 actors ' strike ? reflects real tensions that run deep and wide throughout the labor movement . The question suggested by the last three years of SAG headlines is a practical one : what 's in a union ? It 's a hard question to answer , especially for an industry in which the conditions of production are changPat Aufderheide , a Washington-based journalist , is cultural correspondent for In These Times , ing faster than Woody Allen 's Chameleon Man . The SAG drama has a compelling cast , headed by Ed Asner , who began his second term as union president in November when he won a hands-down victory in the union elections . Asner does n't really act the part and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bledin-the-heart liberal , he blurts out his opinions apparently without thinking about the political applecarts that are going to be upset as a consequence . And while he may be voluble , he 's not necessarily articulate . " We 're a glacier sliding into home base , " he said recently of SAG 'S merger negotiations . But no one in the November elections looked any more like a union official than Asner did . His most active opponents , a conservative " watchdog " group within the union called Actors Working for an Actors Guild ( ANN AG ) , loudly boycotted the whole proceedings . His only official opponent was an angry young black actor who used the platform to denounce SAG 'S lukewarm record on equal-opportunity lobbying . The bickering and ugly quarrels that have marked Asner 's tenure are part of a long-standing problem within the union , but they became more visible to outsiders after Asner was elected in 1980 . Charlton Heston and other conservatives charged him and the rest of the liberals on the Guild 's board with " politicizing " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of striking PATCO workers , and that made Heston ? a close friend of Ronald Reagan 's ? mad . Then Asner publicly presented a $25,000 check ? on behalf of a group called Medical Aid for El Salvador ? to the Salvadoran opposition . It was a personal gesture , but , Heston charged , it implicated the Guild . ( It did n't do anything for Asner 's image either ; when " Lou Grant " ' s ratings slipped , he lacked the clout to save it from being canceled . ) The charges had echoes in the union 's past . In the ' 30s , leftists had pushed the Guild to take a stand on issues such as the Spanish Civil War and social welfare . In the McCarthy era , the Guild made itself a handmaiden of HUAC . But this time the issues refused to settle neatly into political categories of left or right . The bottom line for the union members ? the actors ? is not contingent on whether or not partisan politics is creeping into their lives . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a raging economic sea . 1 T WAS never easy to keep an actors ' union together . This is a union in which 85 percent of the members are unemployed on any given day . Four fifths of them earn less than $5,000 annually as actors , and many do n't make much more at anything else ? over a quarter of the Los Angeles and HARPER'S/JANUARY 1984 73 being made in Canada . I 'd still be working in it , but how about the less well-known actors ? " For Heston , his argument is a defense of the working actor . But Kim Feliner does a slow burn when she hears it . " So when times are tough it 's okay for the other guy not to be earning a decent living , so long as I 've got mine ? That 's not why I joined the labor movement . " A year of discussion has now made a merger seem almost inevitable , and it is n't the only way that SAG is playing a new game ; another is by taking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that Asner 's own political views ? he continues to speak out on El Salvador , for instance ? tend to color the union 's . Not only AWAG conservatives but many rank-and-filers feel that politics has no place in union business , and now they have a loudmouth liberal as president and a board that takes actions like the July 1982 resolution calling for a halt to the nuclear arms race ? an implicit endorsement of the freeze initiative . Asner and others argue that the union needs a political presence to defend itself . He points to the West Coast board 's vote to oppose California 's Proposition A last year . The proposition would have prevented county employees from striking , and the Guild board saw it as a precedent-setting piece of antiunionism . " And I 'll keep on pushing for us to endorse political candidates , " says Asner , who watched this proposal get killed in a sAG vote . " I think we need legislative clout , and events have borne me out in terms of legislative attacks on us this year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering your ass to Ed Asner sounds like trouble to many people who never intended to , say , " join the labor movement " when they got their union cards . They may just have wanted a good job , period . These are hard times , and liberals have n't got much to offer restive members , either those who want the security of the past or those who want to shake things up and carve a place for themselves in the future . The consequent tensions all came out during the autumn elections . " We are boycotting this election not because we 're weak , " Mark McIntire said in October , " but because the liberal-controlled board uses a fascist election procedure . " What McIntire meant was that the SAG board has a nominating committee that endorses some candidates , while unendorsed candidates must get thirty-five signatures from union members to get on the ballot . The endorsement gives sAG-approved candidates an unfair edge , he claims . In the last board election , no AWAG candidates ? all of whom lacked board endorsement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , minority candidate J. D. Hall 's anger was coming to a head . In February 1983 someone ? many suspect it was Hall himself ? leaked a confidential board report on minority hiring in the film industry to the press . The picture was predictably dismal . Blacks , it revealed , were cast in less than 5 percent of all roles and Hispanics in less than 3 percent . The minorities committee demanded that the upcoming SAG contract require producers to employ minorities in 20 to 25 percent of all roles ? if not immediately , then on a timetable . But SAG , desperate to avoid a strike , rejected the controversial proposition . Minorities picketed SAG offices . The incident capped Hall 's conviction that SAG still ignores rank-andfile voices and runs itself by a " star system . " His platform was that of a man who had had it with boardroom politicking . " My goal is to institute direct democracy as much as possible , " he said . I RONICALLY , Ed Asner may be just as frustrated as J. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feels that affirmative action is a fundamental issue , a moral as well as an economic one . " Our media present the ' prototype of American life , ' " he wrote members in the SAG newsletter . " If we fail to document the truth , we perpetuate discrimination . " But he also thinks that SAG is too weak to win many minority demands . He 's dissatisfied with the 1980 contract , for instance . And he points out that SAG is so understaffed it ca n't even get members ' residuals checks out to them on time . Only a stronger union could take on tougher challenges . Asner 's victory may be more a symbol of uncertainty than strength , however . The factions nipping at him from left and right spent more energy in opposition than in presenting alternatives . AWAG , for instance , attacked the argument that SAG should concern itself with minority problems . McIntire got lively press for saying that SAG should stop " chanting the cause of three or four Buddhist eskimos in iron lungs . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but short on solutions . As Ed Asner and a liberal board enter a second three-year term of cautious adjustment to a new-tech media world , the most familiar problems of unions will once again be acted out .
