Since the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965 , dissension has become widespread among Roman Catholics in the U.S. Time after time priests , sisters and lay members alike have publicly and sometimes defiantly questioned policies and dictums emanating from the Vatican . But since he became Pope , John Paul II has been unyielding in his determination to restore certainty in church teaching , and lately he has turned his attention toward America . Perhaps the greatest burden of this simmering dispute has fallen on the 253 active bishops in the U.S. , who are caught between the will of their Pontiff and the insistent expectations of their freewheeling flocks . <P> All elements in the confrontation were present last week in a tense meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington . The differences were embodied in a dispute that occupied much of the convocation : the ecclesiastical troubles of Seattle 's Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen , 65 , who earlier this year was stripped of some of his authority by Rome because of his tolerant outlook on homosexuality and other controversial subjects . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church was at stake . Noting the ways in which Hunthausen had strayed from papal policy , a Vatican official last week explained Rome 's stand . " No business would stand for a daughter concern that so openly drifted from company policy , " he said . " The Pope does n't like being nasty . . . but he feels that ambiguity is slowly nibbling away at people 's perception of the church and that the time has come to say no . " <P> The cultural gulf between Rome and the U.S. exacerbates the conflict . While the American bishops ' starting point tends to be democracy within the church , Rome is concerned first and foremost with religious dogma . According to one Vatican official , U.S. Catholics are heavily influenced by their culture and media , which , to the Pope , create a " society of immediate gratification , " the exact opposite of John Paul 's ethic of " service and commitment . " A final irritant is American Catholics ' penchant for airing disputes in public . <P> The Hunthausen case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Archbishop revealed that Rome had quietly taken away his control over various aspects of doctrine and discipline and handed it to Seattle 's newly named auxiliary bishop , Donald Wuerl , a loyal conservative . Hunthausen 's revelation provoked public squabbling among the bishops and demands by liberals that the U.S. hierarchy fight back . <P> Concerned , the Vatican issued a highly unusual public explanation . In a document sent to U.S. bishops two weeks before the Washington meeting , papal Pro-Nuncio Pio Laghi detailed the matters on which Hunthausen lacked the " firmness necessary to govern the archdiocese . " Besides homosexuality , the list included divorce , sterilization , sacramental rules and church employment of ex-priests . Laghi also charged that Hunthausen had agreed to cede the powers to Wuerl and then reneged on the deal .
