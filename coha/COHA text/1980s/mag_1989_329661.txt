Most journalists occasionally encounter what might be called the Insider 's Lament . Anywhere non-newsies can corner them , someone carps along this line : " Dammit , on subjects I 'm personally involved in , you guys often get it wrong . " The critic usually adds that if he had been consulted , all would have been right . How a journalist responds to this generic complaint depends partly on his tact and hubris quotients . Insiders with their own strong views , after all , tend to cavil about competing ideas and stories they consider less than comprehensive . But when I run into the I.L . these days , I find myself saying , " I know what you mean . " <P> Explaining this sympathy requires one of those shoe-on-the-other-foot tales . Perhaps dog-bites-dog is a better label . Like many Washington-based agents for large news organizations , I am mentioned in other publications now and then . Our work is parsed by press critics ; we get into contretemps with the powerful ; we serve as filler for the growing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate . Those who groan reflexively when needled or critiqued simply confirm the aphorism about journalistic skins being thinner than the average American adult 's . What stokes my personal I.L . is the frequency of error in these items . The venerable practice of checking ostensible facts with the story 's subject seems to be declining . <P> Granted , these worrisome conclusions rest on totally unscientific research . A few recent mentions prompted an inspection of my ego folder of clippings going back several years . Some of the contents were unsettling . Having no reason to believe that I was being singled out for special hazing , I decided that purveyors of the I.L . have a larger point than the news business should tolerate . <P> The Washington Times , for instance , recycled a story from MediaWatch , a right-wing newsletter . MediaWatch 's conviction is that the national press corps is a left-wing cabal bent on discrediting conservatives . In that spirit , it took TIME ( and me ) to task for coverage of a controversy involving Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parroting the MediaWatch article as fact  --  including the erroneous assertion that no TIME reporter had sought Atwater 's side of the story  --  the Washington Times neglected to check with the target of the criticism . The paper dutifully ran a correction . <P> Political bias is only one element of the unchecked-error syndrome . Another could be labeled the pseudoauthoritative dodge . Washingtonian , a prosperous , glossy monthly , does an annual salary survey . This fall 's version , listing hundreds of names linked to specific monetary figures , appears to be based on serious research . Eight TIME staffers were cited . Mystified , several of us agreed that the figures were wrong ( by 30% in one case ) and that none of us had been consulted by Washingtonian . The writer , Robert Pack , explained , " You do n't call hundreds of people and ask them what they make because they wo n't tell you . " Pack insisted that he had knowledgeable sources for his numbers . A Washingtonian editor , however , acknowledged that such stories are " ball-park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
