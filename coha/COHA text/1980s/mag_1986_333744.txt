At the Old Colony Tap in Provincetown , Mass. , everything looks like business as usual as the locals hunker down for a long winter of serious drinking . They hardly seem to notice a good-looking man who answers the telephone , then suddenly bolts out the door and into the street , where a white Rolls-Royce speeds away . Four times this is repeated before finally Norman Mailer says , " Print . " The day 's twelve hours of shooting will not wrap until 3 a.m . Such grueling conditions might test the patience of a film veteran , let alone a neophyte director making his first major motion picture . But the white- haired auteur remains focused and remarkably relaxed . Clad in a bulky parka to ward off the oceanside chill , he comes off like a cross between a Roman senator and a retired longshoreman as he hobnobs with the crew , rehearses the cast and then stands back to watch the action , his eyes twinkling . Between takes , Mailer crosses the street to another pub and peers in at noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he roars with proprietary delight . " That 's classic Provincetown . " <P> Mailer , 63 , is in his element in more ways than one . Based on his best- selling 1984 novel , Tough Guys Do n't Dance , the film is set in the autumnal gloom of the Cape Cod resort that he has frequented for years . In fact , aptly enough , the director 's brick-faced home has been taken over to serve as the onscreen abode of his protagonist Tim Madden , a onetime boxer and womanizing writer who wakes up one morning with a case of alcoholic amnesia and the vague apprehension that he may have killed his wife . Due for release next fall , Tough Guys is a step up from three low-budget bombs Mailer directed during the 1960s . " They were interesting to a certain point and terribly unsuccessful past that point , " concedes the full-time writer who has also dabbled in politics , prizefighting and performing . " Here I 'm trying to make a professional , conventional film on its own terms . " The movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan O'Neal as Madden , Isabella ( Blue ; Velvet ) Rossellini as his smoldering old flame and Newcomer Debra Sandlund as his estranged spouse . It is part of a two-picture deal Mailer has with Cannon films ; the other part , already completed , was to write a screenplay for Jean- Luc Godard 's King Lear . <P> The Tough Guys screenplay is also by Mailer , but while the novel took two months to write , the film took three times as long . " It was tougher than I thought it would be . Scenes that read well on the page would n't play well . " The motivating greed that drives the plot wound up being shifted from real estate to cocaine , and some of the gorier scenes were muted . " A horror film has to be delicate or it becomes a butcher shop , " explains the author . There was also a larger difference . " When you 're a novelist , it 's all yours and your relation to the work is husband , father , grandfather and slave all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're living out in the world .
