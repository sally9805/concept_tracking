GORDON I go nowhere now , with anyone . I sleep here , with a nice friend once in awhile , not often . To tell you the truth , recently at depressing intervals ominously increasing in length .

( Grady takes a flask from her purse , pours whiskey into her tea . ) GRADY . I 'll need a little of this , hope you do n't mind . What does Gordon say about me all the time ? I can just imagine .

In a white summer dress , on a white iron bench , reading my book about Colette . The weather , it was summer , was dazzling . Teal blue skies , air like spring water . She was pregnant Separated from her husband , torturing him , beautiful , and we became lovers . She had her baby with me . I took her to that little hospital , waited . I thought I was the father ! Well , I saw it first ! Before he did ! I named him . Frederick . That was that . They came to live with me , for a year . Then left . Came back . Left again . This was the third time .

I do n't know how you feel , but really , what do you want , love and literature ? GRADY Well , yes . Once you 've had it , you see , you keep trying to keep it You do n't understand that yet . MILLY Because I have n't been to heaven ! I 've been to Fifth Floor , Ward Six ! I 'm trying NOT to have any more of THAT ! GRADY Really ?

GORDON You think I 'm behaving badly . Right ? GRADY Right . GORDON The spectacle of an aging egotist consorting with an orphan out of a mental institution revolts you . Say it GRADY She tells me you are contemporaries by magic . Really ? GORDON You did n't see her when Alice died . John first , then Alice . She was in pieces . She could hardly talk . GRADY She can talk now . GORDON Yes ! GRADY Fine ! She 's twenty-one  --  GORDON Twenty ! GRADY Twenty , and she can take care of herself . Bless you both . ( Pause . ) GORDON Then what is the matter with you ? GRADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRADY Yes . GORDON She left you ? Again ? GRADY Of course . ( Pause. ) @x Milly , Gordon . Embers glow in the fireplace . The snow has stopped . Gordon sits on a pillow by the fire . Milly is looking out the window , a book in her hand . MILLY A few people , moving through snow . Too many . They could all come up here . ( Pause ) know what Faust did when he first made his pact with the Devil ? GORDON He corrupted an innocent child . MILLY That came later . Anyway , she was n't a child . She was a buxom lass who went to bed with a good looking man . It usually happens without supernatural assistance . No , in the old German books , the first thing Faustus did was go to a tavern and order a big dinner . Then , when it came , because the place was so crowded , people jammed in back to back , eating shoulder to shoulder ,  --  well , by God , Faustus for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and every single person in that whole nasty medieval diner turned to stone . And he ate his supper in peace . Would you do that ? GORDON Of course . MILLY So would I. I 'm Faustus . You 're the devil I 've signed in blood . ( She waves her arms . ) There . I just did it . Now nobody else can move . Just you , just me . In that snow down there , they 've all turned to stone , and no one will be coming up here until I say so . No doorbells . The telephone ca n't ring . Life waits on us , and my soul is yours . ( Pause ) Where will you be , next Christmas ? p. 19 GORDON Right here , no doubt . And you ? MILLY Somewhere else . Learning useful things . GORDON How to write ? MILLY How to live , without you . It wo n't be hard . I 'll find other teachers . Get another degree . Teach , myself . Marry a professor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drink . Be mean . Write a book about it . The full life . GORDON I do n't like to think of you like that . MILLY You 'll just have to . My life is my life . I 'm a grubby little intellectual moth , climbing up out of old books . I 'll be a moth forever . My little bag of hopes will stand empty . I will blame my husband for it , and yell at my children . Then I 'll tie my hair in knots . ( Pause . Gordon does n't look at her . She goes to him , kneels behind him . ) Tell me about yourself . When you were a moth . ( She puts her hands over his eyes . ) No , close your eyes . Tell me . Who was he ? ( Gordon leans back against her , eyes closed . She rubs his temples . ) GORDON . He was a Knoxville paperboy , wanting to be a writer . Learned worshipping Tarzan , The Shadow . Holes in his socks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has time to smoke Lucky Strikes , from a green pack , read Tarzan , The Shadow . That what you mean ? p. 20 MILLY Yes . More , what you see . GORDON ( Gordon leans back in her arms . ) No . Your thoughts are so much more vivid than mine . Compared to you , I 'm shopworn . ( Milly holds him against her , smiles . ) MILLY I love you . I love you . I ca n't stop saying it now . I wo n't bother you with it . But do you hear me ? I love you . When I 've vanished  --  no , keep your eyes shut  --  vanished into my life , all gone , do n't forget me . You 've made me so happy . To come into the room . To see you walk into it , where I wait for you . You make me forget what I am . Suddenly , Gordon gets up , pulling himself out of her arms . He goes to the window . ) GORDON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not ? GORDON I thought I could but I ca n't . MILLY Oh . GORDON I do n't want you like baggage , living off me . MILLY I do n't care about that . GORDON You would . People staring at you . Bad enough at lunch and dinner . At breakfast we 'd look like something out of a Bunuel movie together . You would get tired of me . I might get tired of you . p. 21 MILLY Tired ? GORDON That 's the best thing chat could happen . MILLY What 's the worst ? GORDON I could n't come back without you . You 'd marry me . You 'd turn in to a nurse . Oh , all right for a while . Fun . But I 'm sixty-one years old . You 'd be a Princess for a year . Then a friend . Then a secretary . Then a nurse . And then a slave . MILLY Stop . GORDON At the end , you 'd put me in a nursing home and wait to collect . MILLY Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause . ) MILLY Oh , I believe it I would n't want us looking like a Bunuel movie together . OK . ( She smiles . She looks at her book . ) " Poor Old Henry . " GORDON What ? MILLY A book , look , a book . Not Spanish , German . Der Arme Heinrich . Poor Old Henry . Not read much any more , but I think it would make a terrific movie . Maybe you can sell it to somebody . ( Pause . She smiles . ) It 's about a medieval knight Very honest , decent and brave . Not because Henry worships God or anything , he just likes being wonderful . Smooth and elegant and in shape and witty and smart ; and vain . So'God punishes Henry . With leprosy . Instant old age . His eyeballs fall into his highballs , plop , like that . p. 22 GORDON Milly . MILLY His supermanhood rots right away on his bones . His nose ? God ! A hole in his face ! His fingers ? Horrors ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry ca n't feel his feet at all , so he stumps around bending over , like an old man climbing the stairs . GORDON Now please . Calm down . MILLY I 'm not going to calm down ! I 'm going to tell you this story ! ( Pause . ) Henry consults specialists . Doctors , wizards , magicians . They all say there 's only one cure . The leper 's body must be washed in the blood of a virgin . Enter a little girl . GORDON I 'm not surprised . MILLY You will be . Her name was Sigrid She was as sick as Henry . She wanted to be a saint . So when she realized she could have her veins cut open and her blood donated to famous Knight-Leper Henry , she was happy . They were both proud . Two of a kind . GORDON The Leper and the Virgin . MILLY The title already ! Knew you 'd catch on ! Well , no fool Heinrich . If a crazy virgin wants to give him a bath in her blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl naked ! Hang her upside down over pots and pans ! Slit her veins ! Drain her blood ! Ah ! He sees her ! All innocence and purity ! All sexy and bloody ! The end ! p. 23 GORDON She dies ? MILLY What do you think ? Once the toothpaste is out of the tube , it 's a little hard to get it back in again GORDON Milly ! MILLY No , she does n't die . Henry stops the doctors . He 'll stay a leper before he 'll bathe in her blood . She did that to him . She made out of this selfish rotten old leper a real man . He did n't want her to die . He did n't want to hurt her . Or maybe he could n't take the sight of all that blood . Anyway , miracle ! He gets better . His nose grows back . His fingers move . All those rotten scales fall from his skin and his soul . God gives him back his life , and he enjoys a long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't stay that way because he marries her , you see . ( She runs to him , sits in his lap . ) Just a minute ! Let me sit here just a minute , like a little girl ! ( She jumps up , pushes him away . ) No ! Just never mind ! GORDON Milly , listen to me ! MILLY Not one word ! You did n't have to worry about me ! I would have left Spain anytime . I would have said goodbye , made you proud of me . I would have married you , too , been your wife and your nurse . You could have had my blood , and dipped your pen in it . ( She kisses him . He leans forward , embracing her . She backs away , so that Gordon falls to his knees. ) p. 24 MILLY Old man .

What do you want us to do about it , say she should n't ? We know how sensitive you are , darling , and oh God the suffering , but the woman went back to her kid . Gordon 's nymphet went back to her schoolbooks . What a tragedy ! THOMAS Make the best of it , Gordon , and find another Lolita Make the best of it , Grady , and meet Mona for lunch at the Plaza .

For the sanitation department . I do n't know just exactly how . LUCIEN All right ! After years of squalid marriage with a sanitation department lawyer , cooking food and washing socks , then oh ! Grady steps in , dripping Bach and mink ? Two precious modern hearts , skipping beats like one ? She 'll come back . THOMAS Lesbians are intimacy junkies . GRADY What ?

Which one of us killer fruits are you coming home with , Bill ? p. 28 BILL Got ta know ? LUCIEN Got ta know . GRADY The suspense is killing us . BILL A killer fruit , by definition in New York , is an elegant , rich , successful , powerful gentlemen , or I suppose now , lady , of high , same sex inclinations , who will wage ferocious war over youthful flesh . You can not attack them verbally , they are too self-assured . You can not hope to deflate them egotistically , they are protected by their achievements . You can not even get mad at them . They are so profoundly infantile , they only smile at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like that . Goo . LUCIEN All right , goo . What 's the point ? BILL Point is I am going home to my trundle bed , to pass out in isolation and freedom . The great gurus of India and I understand the superior virtures of semen retention . It is the path to God and Co-Ops . My best friend is my telephone . I trust dead writers , sometimes my agent , and the paychecks I get acting on soaps . My life and real love are incompatable , and I have the sense to see that and go to bed ONLY WHEN I PLEASE ! Of course , you are all charming , and useful maybe someday , so I hope you will keep on asking me out . And that , in youthful candor , is what I think about New York !
