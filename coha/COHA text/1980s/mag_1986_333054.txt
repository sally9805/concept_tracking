AT &T; has 90% of my business because AT &T; offers better rates than MCI ( ECONOMY &; BUSINESS , Aug. 25 ) . I know , because with two phones , I have one on each . If MCI and US Sprint want my long-distance dollars , they must offer price and service . So far , AT &T; has the edge in both . <P> Tom Pittman <P> Manhattan , Kans . <P> The assertion that MCI has been overcharging customers for uncompleted calls simply is not true . We do not begin to bill for a call after a certain number of seconds or a certain number of rings . We begin to bill when the call is answered and have very sophisticated means for determining when that occurs . <P> Howard Crane <P> MCI Communications <P> Washington <P> TIME regrets the error .
