The captain , along with two lieutenants identified as accomplices , were formally charged today in connection with the kidnapping , the Interior Minister said. // He said the whereabouts of the priest , the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko , was unknown . Father Popieluszko is known for his nationalistic sermons , which have drawn thousands of people to his Church of St. Stanislaw Kostka in Warsaw . <> <> Lawyer Sees ' Only One Conclusion ' // Father Popieluszko ' s lawyer , Edward Wende , said in a telephone interview that there could be " only one conclusion " drawn from General Kiszc zak ' s remarks. // " I am sure the priest is dead , and I think it is a horrible thing , " he said . " The Minister did admit that one of them confessed he had killed . He would have to be insane to confess to murder if he did not commit it , and I don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unfortunately , I am not in a position to give information or even sufficient assumptions as to the fate of the kidnapped . " <> <> Conflicting Statements Given // The general , whose department oversees all police agencies , said the three accused men had given conflicting statements. // " The organizer of the kidnapping contends for his part that he himself killed the kidnapped , " the general said . " The area where , according to him , the crime occurred , has also been thoroughly combed . No traces have been found. " // He added that " the kidnapping was organized by Capt . Grzegorz Piotrowski. " // Some Poles have speculated that the kidnapping may have been carried out by a renegade element of the security forces seeking to embarrass or weaken the Polish leader , Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski . There have also been suggestions that the kidnapping was the work of a hard-line anti-Solidarity group within the security forces. // In Warsaw today , the police stepped up their patrols , apparently to discourage any street demonstrations . The Government press agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day and " took necessary actions to prevent possible threats . " It did not elaborate. // General Kiszczak , wearing his military uniform , went on television to make the announcement. // He said one of the captain ' s accomplices had told the police that Father Popieluszko was left alive on the outskirts of Torun , where the abduction occurred on a highway Oct. 19. // " However , a lengthy search in that area has not had any effect , " General Kiszczak said. // He identified the two other Interior Ministry officers as Lieut . Waldemar Chmielewski , and Lieut . Leszek Pekala. // " They have been accused of the abduction and , if this is justified by further investigation , also of other offenses embodied in the penal code , " General Kiszczak said . He added that the three faced possible death sentences. // " Unfortunately , I am not in a position to give information or even sufficient assumptions as to the fate of the kidnapped , " the general said. // Father Popieluszko , 37 years old , became one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlawed Solidarity labor federation , the first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc. // General Kiszczak pledged that the authorities would " spare no effort so that the fate of Father Jerzy Popieluszko can be definitively established. " // " In Poland , nobody can perish without a trace , " he said . " Our country is not and will not be a jungle of lawlessness. " // He hinted that the kidnapping was a political attack aimed against the state security agencies. // " The deliberate actions of the perpetrators are striking , " he said . " They were designed to possibly quickly direct the investigation to a supposition that the kidnappers were officials of the Interior Ministry. " // Earlier today , the press accused Solidarity activists of exploiting the priest ' s abduction to try to set up a clash with the authorities. // Leading newspapers published on their front pages a commentary by the Government news agency that accused Solidarity activists of seeking " to bring about a clash at all costs. " // " Though the question of who , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been made clear yet , those who are now politically capitalizing on the tragedy as well as their aims are already known , " the agency said. // The Roman Catholic primate , Jozef Cardinal Glemp , directed that a mass be said in all Warsaw churches on Sunday " in intention of the return of the kidnapped priest. " // A group of the priest ' s friends had been working in the rectory of his church to collect and disseminate information on reaction to the kidnapping. // But Solidarity ' s former national spokesman , Janusz Onyszkiewicz , said the group had ended its activities at Cardinal Glemp ' s request. // At an informal news conference outside the rectory , the spokesman said of the authorities : // " Attack is the best defense . I think they are under political pressure , under terrific heat , for what has happened to Father Popieluszko. " // The priest ' s driver , the only witness to the kidnapping , was taken to a police headquarters today to identify the three suspects , Mr. Onyszkiewicz said. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " identified one of them as being one of those present at the abduction , " Mr. Onys zkiewicz said . " He recognized two others by the way they walked , but not by their faces. " // Since his release from protective police custody early last week , the driver has been staying at the rectory and has been guarded by volunteers. // A Central Committee ' s statement on Friday called for a special review by the ruling Politburo of the activities of the nation ' s police apparatus and hinted at possible personnel changes within the Interior Ministry. // //
