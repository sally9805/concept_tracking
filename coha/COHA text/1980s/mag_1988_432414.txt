 | The locked steel door at Washington 's National Airport bears a bright red sign with a stern warning : DISPLAY OF PROPER IDENTIFICATION IS REQUIRED TO ENTER THIS AREA . And with good reason . The door leads to the tarmac , where planes load and refuel , and to stairways that bypass passenger-screening checkpoints . Getting through that door without a key or an airport ID should be impossible . But as a plainclothes special agent for the Federal Aviation Administration discovered recently , it could n't be easier . The agent asked a worker coming out to hold the door , and the man happily complied . " Did you see that ? " exclaimed the agent . " That was an airport security guard . " Such security breaches are all too common at U.S. airports . Federal auditors testing X-ray procedures for carry-on luggage reported that major airports , on average , missed 20 percent of the auditors ' dummy weapons ? and one airport missed 66 percent . Another audit found that Los Angeles International Airport could not account for 6,000 employe-identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A special Department of Transportation task force has issued dozens of recommendations for security improvements in the past year . Yet , says Secretary of Transportation James Burnley , the FAA ignored the ideas or implemented them only halfheartedly . Burnley contends that the FAA , with its dual charter to promote aviation as well as police it , has become too cozy with the airlines it regulates . " I 've run out of patience with the security-enforcement philosophy down in the bowels of the FAA , " he says . " We 've got a buddy system in aviation security . " The watchdogs . FAA officials say that they 're trying to be good cops , but with 450 security agents to police 400 airports , they ca n't watch everyone all the time . Besides , say FAA and air-industry officials , U.S. aviation security works pretty well . Last year , airlines screened 1.2 billion passengers in this country and seized 3,000 weapons . Only four persons tried to hijack planes ; none was successful , and none carried a gun . Richard Lally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , declares : " The system does n't deserve an indictment ; it deserves commendation . " Recently , however , U S. News reporters checked several American airports ? and found security in sorry shape . Their most startling discovery : At some airports , the real problem does n't lie with baggage X-rays ; rather , reporters found that they could bypass passenger screening altogether and at very little risk . At Washington National just 2 miles from FAA headquarters ? a reporter with a suitcase walked right past a security checkpoint on the side where arriving passengers walk out . The reporter pretended to make a call at a row of pay phones near the checkpoint , then slipped by when guards turned their backs . At a second checkpoint , the reporter 's companion walked through the wrong way when guards were n't paying attention . On the same afternoon , the reporter bypassed two other security checkpoints at Washington National by walking into passenger-boarding areas through rear doors , where arriving passengers come out . Both sets of doors were out of sight of security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One even had handles on the outside for easy opening . At Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport , a visitor found a baggage-room security door open . He walked through with his briefcase into the baggage-truck passageway , onto the tarmac where planes fuel and load and up a Jetway staircase . He then entered the terminal as if deplaning and caught another flight ? without ever going through security . A reporter watched in amazement as janitors at O'Hare and Midway airports in Chicago pushed large plastic trash cans up to the passenger checkpoint . The janitors went through the metal detectors , but they pulled the cans through on the unscreened side . Guards neither inspected the trash cans ? a serious security violation ? nor checked other parcels brought in by food vendors . At Atlanta 's Hartsfield Airport , a reporter discovered that if she waited outside locked security doors , exiting employes would let her pass through . She watched an employe punch a code into the door 's lock , then tried the same code on several other doors on the concourse . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms and beyond ? to planes on the tarmac . Extra care . FAA security chief Raymond Salazar , when confronted with reports of these breaches , promised that the problems would be corrected quickly . " With our recent emphasis on security , there should be very few instances like this , " he said . And two days after a reporter showed FAA officials the breaches at National Airport , most were readily fixed ? by the addition of locks to doors and the posting of extra guards . But at one checkpoint , a reporter was able to walk past security guards once again . Said Salazar : " The common thread is people . How do you get people to be suspicious all of the time ? " Indeed , whenever airport security comes into question , the guards hired by the airlines bear the brunt of the criticism . Union officials acknowledge that some security firms have high employe turnover . They say that 's what you get when security firms pay minimum wages to win airport contracts . " They do n't want to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , " says Israel Saenz , secretary-treasurer of the San Jose , Calif. , local of the International Union of Security Officers . But the airline industry 's Richard Lally argues : " You can hire a Ph.D . at $100,000 a year , and he probably would n't do as good a job as the people involved . " And even the best-paid guards ca n't work with ineffective equipment . Emanuel Kapelsohn , a police weapons expert ,  | astonished a congressional subcommittee by demonstrating how guns could be smuggled through metal detectors if carried at a certain spot on the body . The detectors , it seems , are not effective at all heights . The National Rifle Association contends that the debate over plastic pistols obscures the worrisome fact that people can get metal guns onto planes . " The more I learn about airport security , the more scared I get , " says James Baker , an NRA spokesman . The FAA also concedes that there is no system yet in place to X-ray checked baggage on domestic flights . The volume is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted in checked luggage . An explosives sniffer that would detect bombs is years away from practical use . Security personnel struggle under yet another disadvantage : A mandate to make air travel as pleasant as possible . When guards caught a reporter walking through checkpoints on the wrong side , they simply told him to go back through screening or to wait outside . They were always polite . If anyone can bludgeon the airlines into improving security , it is Transportation Secretary Burnley . There has been some movement : Last month , the FAA launched a series of white-glove security inspections at 16 U.S. airports , and the agency has told airports to put computer-card-operated locks on security doors . But Burnley has not always been happy with the FAA 's trickle-down enforcement of his orders . After a former airline employe with an old ID card fired a pistol on a Pacific Southwest Airlines flight in California last December , causing a crash and 43 deaths , Burnley directed that airline employes be screened as rigorously as passengers . Weeks later , he learned that most airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through security checkpoints . After the Transportation Department told the FAA to impose heavy fines on airlines that missed test weapons in spot checks , Burnley heard that the agency was waiting until the airlines failed three tests before issuing fines . He fired off a memo to FAA chief T. Allan McArtor on March 8 telling him to toughen up enforcement ? pronto . Burnley later told Congress that having the FAA both police and serve the airlines was " an experiment that has failed . " Higher penalties . Some members of Congress think that the FAA 's problems start with Burnley . Senator Wendell Ford ( D-Ky. ) has introduced legislation to make the FAA an independent entity , taking it out of Burnley 's department and his " ever meddling staff . " Amid all the noise , there is some heat . Already , Congress has hiked penalties for security and other kinds of violations from $1,000 to $10,000 per incident . And an aviation subcommittee chaired by Democratic Representative Cardiss Collins of Illinois has called on the FAA to close the security loopholes immediately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide Warner Session : " You do n't wait for the bodies to pile up at the intersection before you fix the stoplight.
