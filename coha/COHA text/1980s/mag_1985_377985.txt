For most of this century , Beulah , N. Dak. , was a sleepy prairie town with two grocery stores and a pair of gas stations . Founded in 1913 and named for the niece of the region 's largest landowner , Beulah was populated mostly by farmers and coal miners . Then , in 1978 , the Department of Energy announced that it would finance a $2.1 billion commercial synthetic-fuels plant , the first in the U.S. , to be built on the outskirts of Beulah . Operated by a five-member consortium of energy companies , including Tenneco and Transco Energy , the 600-acre project would turn coal into natural gas and be the centerpiece of the Government 's efforts to produce substitutes for expensive imported oil . When the Great Plains Gasification Project opened in July 1984 , Beulah was booming . Its population had jumped from 1,300 in 1977 to 5,600 , as $100,000 houses and even a golf course appeared . <P> Today Beulah is a town in crisis . Great Plains has lost much of its Government backing . Moreover , its synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling . The plant may be shuttered within a month , dealing a devastating blow to the community , the state of North Dakota and the future of synthetic fuels . Great Plains has an annual payroll of $36 million , employing 973 people and generating more than 5,000 additional jobs in the area . Says Cynthia Lynk , executive director of Beulah 's Chamber of Commerce : " If the plant closes , we 'll have businesses shutting down , school enrollments off and houses left empty all over . " Concludes Beulah City Planner John Rogers : " It would be a disaster . " <P> The troubles of the synfuels industry deepened last month when the U.S. House of Representatives voted 312 to 111 to eliminate all funding for the Synthetic Fuels Corporation , which has financed several large-scale projects . The bill provides only $500 million for a Department of Energy program of synfuels research . The Senate is expected to pass a similar measure . As Congress has grown increasingly skeptical of synfuels , so too has the DOE . Last month it decided to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , the plant 's private consortium of owners announced that it was pulling out of the project . <P> Great Plains is now under the control of the DOE . Last week the department sent a team of investigators to inspect Great Plains and confer with plant managers . Some employees hoped the Government would find a way to keep the project running . Said Michael Mujadin , the operations director : " Once they see things for themselves , I 'm confident the DOE will let us continue . " But that may prove impossible if Congress decides to cut off synfuels funding . <P> Rarely , if ever , has a Government program grown so large only to face extinction in so short a time . Created in 1980 , the Synthetic Fuels Corporation had a monstrous initial budget of $15 billion . At the time , some experts expected the price of imported oil to reach $60 per bbl. by the end of the decade . The only solution seemed to be a drive to convert coal reserves , like those underlying the Great Plains site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandiose goal called for the U.S. to produce the equivalent of 2 million bbl. of crude oil a day by 1992 , replacing about 50% of imports .
