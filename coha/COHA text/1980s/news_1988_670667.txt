A herbicide tested at the site by American and Peruvian scientists last March proved effective against the hardy coca plant . Experiments with aerial application are planned . If they are successful - and if the United States Government can resolve a dispute with the herbicide ' s producer - the first program of large-scale eradication of coca plants may follow. // " This is the only way we ' re going to get a handle on the cocaine problem , " said Craig Chretien , who heads the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ' s operation in Peru. // Yet even before chemical eradication of coca begins , a dispute has erupted over the ecological effect of the American-made herbicide known as Spike , with environmental groups charging that the Reagan Administration is rushing ahead for political reasons. // " The Republicans want to be able to point to eradication when they ' re asked ' What have you done about drugs ?

" <> <> Maker Disagrees // In fact , the State Department , the Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have already disagreed over the use of the herbicide against coca , and Eli Lilly &; Company of Indianapolis , which manufactures Spike , announced last month that because of " a number of practical and policy considerations " it will not supply the chemical to the United States Government for use in coca eradication. // In Peru , the Social Democratic Government of President Alan Garcia , reportedly anxious to use the drug issue to improve its relations with Washington , has indicated that it is willing to move toward chemical eradication of coca if it is convinced that the herbicide is not harmful to other plants , animals and human beings. // Officials in Bolivia , which with Peru accounts for more than 90 percent of the world ' s coca leaf production , have said that the nation will not act as " a guinea pig " for experimentation with toxic herbicides . Opposition to the program is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The United States , apparently still convinced that it is easier to cut off supply than to curb demand for cocaine , has sought to reassure Peruvian public opinion of Spike ' s low toxicity . " It is less toxic than aspirin , nicotine and nitrate fertilizers , " said Ann B. Wrobleski , Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters. // Environmental advocates disagree . They say the use of the herbicide is at best a dangerous ecological gamble , particularly in a fragile environment like the coca-growing areas , They say they are particularly concerned about the herbicide ' s long-range effects. // At the same time , responding to expressions of concern about the impact of Spike on the subtropical environment of the Upper Huallaga Valley , the United States Embassy in Lima is trying to draw local attention to the widespread deforestation , land erosion and poisoning of rivers already taking place there as a result of coca planting and processing . The valley stretches north of this city , which lies 230 miles northeast of Lima . <> <> Waterways Called Polluted // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Claudio Saito , a former head of Peru ' s National Parks and now an adviser to an American-financed rural development program in the valley . " The main damage comes from deforestation and erosion. " // Another Peruvian expert , Buenaventura Marcelo of the National Agrarian University , has said drug traffickers routinely pollute the valley ' s waterways with kerosene , sulfuric acid , quicklime , carbide , acetone and toluene , which are used in processing coca leaves into coca paste and base. // The devastation caused to the 150-mile-long valley in central Peru since the " coke rush " began here a decade ago is dramatically apparent from the air . Once-wooded hills are scarred by coca fields covering 250 , 000 acres , and scores of smoke plumes identify the spots where slash-and-burn techniques are being used to open new fields. // Yet , no less dramatic , a helicopter ride over this country ' s most productive coca-growing areas in the company of Peruvian and American officials also serves to underline the hopelessness of trying to deal with cocaine " at the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last five years , the United States has been financing a program of manual eradication of coca in the valley , using 400 Peruvian laborers who pull the plants from the ground . But during this time only 38 , 000 acres of coca have been destroyed while a larger area has entered production . <> <> Laboratories Are Target // For the last year , Peruvian narcotics agents have also stepped up interdiction efforts in the valley , concentrating on the destruction of clandestine laboratories producing coca paste and base and of airstrips where the semi-refined product is picked up for final processing into pure cocaine in Colombia. // " We ' ve destroyed 17 laboratories in the past three months , but there must be dozens more , " said Gen. Juan Zarate , the chief of Peru ' s anti-drug police . " They ' re very difficult to find.

After all valuables were removed , the laboratory was burned to the ground. // The difficulties faced by eradication and interdiction programs in such a vast area have been compounded over the last two years by growing guerrilla activities , with the Maoist Shining Path movement using the Government ' s anti-drug program as a way of winning support among peasant coca growers. // " I wouldn ' t say there is an alliance between traffickers and guerrillas , " General Zarate said , " but there is clearly a relationship because they share the same area .

Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area was a factor in persuading President Garcia to approve herbicide testing in the area since last October. // The United States is supporting aerial spraying of opium poppy , from which heroin is extracted , and marijuana in six countries , but it had not until recently given priority to finding a herbicide that could be used against the highly resistant coca plant. // A test spraying program in Colombia ' s coca-growing lowlands in 1984 was abandoned after the Dow Chemical Corporation demanded indemnification against lawsuits if its herbicide Garlon-4 proved appropriate . But United States officials involved in the experiment recalled that the herbicide was less than effective and that Washington showed little interest in the program at the time. // " It was all highly improvised , " an official said . " We had minimal resources and no scientific support. " // In contrast , the experiment in Peru , coinciding with a surge of concern about drugs in the United States , appears to enjoy the political and scientific support of the Reagan Administration .

The plants in the test area have now died , and soil samples have been removed for laboratory analysis. // American officials said that , if approved by the Peruvian Government , aerial testing will take place in the next 90 days using Spike , the trade name for tebuthiuron , and Velpar , the trade name for a herbicide called hexazinone made by The Du Pont Company. // Many environmental advocates raise the same objections to Velpar that they do to Spike . Spike would be applied as pellets , dropped from a plane , that would then melt into the soil with the rain . Velpar can be sprayed . The officials said that negotiations were still taking place with Eli Lilly in the hope of persuading the company to drop its objections to the use of Spike against coca . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes it fears for the security of its employees in other Latin American countries if it takes part in coca eradication . Drug policy experts in Washington say the company ' s concern over possible liability for any damage to people or the environment is also an element in the Lilly position. // There have been differences of opinion within the United States Government as well . The Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not responsible for ruling on the safety of a product used outside the United States or in an environment for which it has not been specifically registered . Without E.P.A. approval , there is effectively no recognized environmental check. // The State Department has denied charges that it has put political concerns ahead of environmental ones . The Agriculture Department , accused of failing to assess the environmental impact of the herbicide , says such assessments are not its responsibility. // Some American officials also noted that , while the Reagan Administration seems eager to initiate large-scale eradication this year , many more months of both scientific testing and political persuasion may be needed before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current focus of the debate here is ecological , the Garcia administration must also weigh the domestic social and economic cost of coca eradication against the benefits it will bring to this country ' s international image . <> <> Many Depend on Coca Crop // Although the coca leaf has traditionally been chewed by Peru ' s large Indian population , the peasants who have migrated to the Upper Huallaga Valley grow coca exclusively for export . There are nonetheless about 60 , 000 families in the area who depend on the cash crop for their survival. // Coca eradication will therefore provoke a social convulsion , forcing thousands of families to leave the area and creating deep resentment that the Shining Path will be ready to exploit. // At the same time , with Peru experiencing its worst economic crisis this century , many Government officials are worried about the implications of losing even some of the $800 million to $1. 2 billion estimated to enter Peru annually thanks to coca. // " Coca accounts for about 40 percent of our export income , " a Peruvian economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government , but it enters the economy and prevents our currency from collapsing . Without that money , I don ' t know what will happen. " // Some foreign narcotics experts who support chemical eradication nonetheless say they doubt it can stop the export of coca products from Peru. // " There is even an environmental question , " one expert said . " If the growers lose their crops in the valley , they may just move on , cut down more trees and plant more coca. " //
