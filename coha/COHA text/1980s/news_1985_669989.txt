NEW YORK  --  Bond prices wound up little changed yesterday despite a surge in the nation ' s basic money supply . The basic money measure , known as M1 , jumped $5. 3 billion in the week ended Sept. 30 , according to figures released by the Federal Reserve System yesterday afternoon . The increase was larger than economists generally had expected . Many analysts attributed the rise largely to problems caused by Hurricane Gloria last month . They contend that money figures to be reported next week will show a decline , offsetting most , if not all , of the big bulge . Bond trading activity was relatively light as many money managers remained unwilling to take on new investments until Congress passes a measure to boost the federal debt ceiling . Delays in raising the limit have left the government with a huge financing backlog . By some estimates , the government must sell about $50 billion of new notes and bonds by early next month .

Adding to the investor jitters has been continuing debate among analysts about the outlook for the economy and for Federal Reserve credit policy . Some economists say business activity remains in the doldrums and predict the Fed will ease credit conditions later this year . Others , however , argue that the economy is gaining momentum and that the Fed will pull in its credit reins , driving up interest rates in an attempt to slow the explosive growth of the nation ' s money supply . The Fed estimated M1 averaged a seasonally adjusted $615 billion in the Sept. 30 week , up from a revised $609. 7 billion the previous week . The prior week ' s figure was originally estimated at $609. 8 billion . Many analysts blamed the bulge on Hurricane Gloria , which hit the eastern seaboard on Friday , Sept. 27 , and forced many corporations and banks to close for the day . As a result , some companies couldn ' t take excess funds from their checking accounts and put them to work in money-market investments as they normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes savings and investments . The Fed ' s M1 target calls for an annual growth rate of 3% to 8% in this year ' s second half . The latest surge left M1 $14. 5 billion above target when the target is depicted in the traditional way using a conelike figure . Under a more flexible method , which uses two parallel lines to show the target range , the measure is $12. 8 billion above the upper limit . Monthly figures showed M1 grew at an 11. 7% annual rate in September , averaging $611. 8 billion , up from $605. 9 billion in August . Separately , the Fed reported that M2 , a broader money measure , rose $14. 7 billion in September , while an even broader measure , M3 , increased $25. 5 billion . The Fed said M2 averaged $2. 5284 trillion in September , compared with $2. 5137 trillion a month earlier . M3 increased to an average of $3. 1633 trillion from $3. 1378 trillion . So far this year , M2 has grown at an annual rate of 9. 3% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The central bank is seeking 6% to 9% growth in M2 this year and 6% to 9. 5% growth in M3 . During September M2 grew at an annual rate of 7% , while M3 expanded at a rate of 9. 8% . David M. Jones , an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &; Co. , contends the Federal Reserve adopted slightly tougher credit policy last month in response to the rapid growth in M1 . " It appears the Fed tightened in mid-September , " he said . In Mr. Jones ' s view , the interest rate on federal funds is likely to average about 8% in coming weeks , up from an average of about 7 7/8% recently . Federal funds are reserves that banks lend one another overnight . " The tempo of economic activity is picking up , " according to Mr. Jones . He predicted the gross national product , adjusted for inflation , will expand at a 4% annual rate this quarter . That would compare with a 2. 8% pace estimated by the government for the third quarter . Mr. Maude of Refco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic activity " remains exceedingly sluggish " and predicts inflation-adjusted GNP will grow at a moderate 3. 5% annual rate this quarter . The Fed will " maintain a steady credit policy " in coming months because of the contradictory signals being emitted by economic statistics and by the money-supply figures , Mr. Maude argued . " If it weren ' t for the rapid money growth , the Fed would be pursuing a more accommodative credit policy , " he said . The government today is scheduled to release September figures on retail sales and on producer prices . Analysts in several recent surveys generally estimated retail sales rose between 1. 5% and 2. 5% last month , compared with a gain of 1. 9% in August . They expect little change in the producer price index , which declined 0. 3% in August . Bankers Trust Co. estimates retail sales may have jumped 3% last month , fueled mainly by feverish sales of automobiles on which manufacturers offered cut-rate financing .
