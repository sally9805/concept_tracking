YVES MONTAND <P> The calendar said September , but the audiences filling Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House obviously did not believe it . When the jaunty man in the black vest and open-necked shirt sauntered out from the wings , it was April in Paris and the giant stage was a boulevard : for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century , Yves Montand is once again on tour in America . <P> For an hour and a half , through some 30 songs , he does what only he can do . He brings to life the almost forgotten spirit of the Parisian music hall , still vital , vibrant and surging with what he calls l ' lectricit . Singing all but one of his numbers in French , he ranges from comic routines to nostalgic set pieces , from songs of social protest to romantic ballads as sharp and bittersweet as anisette . <P> Indeed , Montand , with his sad , weary , Bogart eyes , is best when he sings of love and melancholy , which seem , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most audiences , moreover , will almost certainly know a bit of his history : his early romance with Edith Piaf , his brief affair with Marilyn Monroe and his long and enduring marriage to Actress Simone Signoret . Montand does not stand alone . He is surrounded by ghosts , memories and the soft , dusky glow of nostalgia . <P> In a show that runs without intermission , only once is he offstage . And even then his image is on : a giant screen descends , and in a skit written by Simone Signoret , Montand dictates to an unseen and unfeeling telephone operator a telegram of love to his mistress . The dialogue is hilarious , a reminder that Montand , the chanteur extraordinaire , is also a gifted actor and comedian , the star of such films as The Wages of Fear , Z and La Guerre Est Finie . <P> That acting ability , in fact , is what makes Montand such a magnetic singer . His voice is superb , of course , as mellow and true as a bass viol ; at 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 30 years ago . But the soul of a Montand song is not just in his voice , it is in his lithe , dancer 's body , his mobile face , and his articulate , talkative hands and fingers . The soul is also in the lyrics themselves , and Montand 's elegant and inimitable phrasing . The pity , it must be added , is that so much will be lost on audiences that do not know , and can not be expected to know , French . The songs , to be sure , are translated in the program , but the lyrics are impossible to follow in a darkened theater . <P> Another pity , both in New York and the six other American and Canadian cities Montand will visit on his six-week tour , is that he is booked into such huge theaters . The Metropolitan , for example , seats about 4,000 ; the Olympia in Paris , where Montand is accustomed to playing , holds only 2,100 . The Metropolitan Opera House was designed for grand opera , not intimacy and even Montand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the other vast halls he will be playing . <P> - By Gerald Clarke
