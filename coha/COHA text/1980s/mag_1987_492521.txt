Sisters of Forgiveness  --  Together Against AIDS  --  crusade to create a guaranteed AIDS-free blood supply . by Cory SerVaas , M. D. When Candy Lightner 's beautiful 13-year-old daughter was killed in a drunk-driver accident , Candy started an organization called Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) . The nationwide organization that grew from her grief crusaded and educated young people everywhere about the dangers of driving while drunk . It brought grief-stricken women together to share their sorrow and expend their emotions constructively by helping spare others such tragedies . A similar group of bereaved women are now sharing their losses and forming a support group called Sisters of Forgive ness  --  Together Against AIDS ( SOFT AIDS ) . They cry together , pray together , write to each other , and speak out in churches about forgiving and about donating safe blood so that never again will a hospital patient contract AIDS from a transfusion . The SOFT AIDS are inspired by the likes of Deborah Loeb of Battle Ground , Indiana . You read about her in last month 's Post  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became closer when they learned her husband had AIDS after having a blood transfusion . Long before her husband died , the Loebs had forgiven the donor and helped raise money for the hospital that had the misfortune of administering the AIDS-infected blood . Like Deborah , Nell Gann has forgiven her husband 's AIDS donor ( September ' 87 Post ) and prays to help others . We brought Nell , whose husband , Paul , suffers from AIDS , to San Francisco for a meeting with Deborah Loeb . The " sisters " shared their deepest emotions about a common enemy , AIDS . Then there 's the inspiration of Betty M. , who first called the Post in tears upon learning that her son was very ill with AIDS . . ? . Was there any hope ? Was there any new treatment about to be released ? Why had n't his lover told her sooner ? When her son died , Betty was bitter about his lover , who , in her mind , had caused her son 's downfall . Like Deborah , she forgave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son 's death was not in vain . Now she counsels mothers of gays wherever she can find them . Betty has become an expert on the subject of the AIDS virus : she donates blood ; she goes to schools and churches to talk about the need for monogamous couples to give blood ; she explains autologous ( pre-donate your own ) blood transfusions and directed donations ( example : when a brother , husband , or other family member donates for a woman requiring blood for a Caesarean section ) . Like Deborah she wants to prevent anyone from dying of a blood transfusion , so she warns people everywhere not to go near a blood bank to donate blood if there is any possibility they might be harboring the AIDS virus . She educates whole congregations about the " false negative " window in the blood bank screening process . She explains that we are still waiting for an " antigen " test that will , when combined with the antibody test , make blood banks better able to screen out all early AIDS infections . AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't time for anger , a most destructive emotion . They 've forgiven . Do you remember the Ann Landers column that said , " Hate is like acid . It can damage the vessels in which it is stored as well as destroy the object on which it is poured " ? It is a time for forgiveness in our whole country , and as I thought of the mighty nucleus SOFT AIDS could become with its message of forgiveness , a strange coincidence happened . It was like an answer to a prayer . Our family had gone to Holland , Michigan , to see our cousin the Rev. Ervin Roorda be installed at the Third Reformed Church there . The coincidence was that while I was writing about the Sisters of Forgiveness , his sermon , to my surprise , was on " Forgiveness . " Every member of SOFT AIDS should hear it or read it . With eloquence , he dramatized the forgiveness story of Corrie ten Boom : " She lived in Amsterdam during World War II , where her family owned a watchmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family began to assist the Jews , who were being rounded up and sent to death camps . " Eventually someone betrayed the family , and the ten Booms were also sent off to a concentration camp . Corrie and her sister , Betsy , found themselves in the infamous Ravensbriick camp . " Only Corrie survived the ordeal . After the war she traveled around Europe , speaking on the themes of forgiveness and reconciliation . " After one particular talk in Munich , a man came forward to thank her for her address . Corrie could n't believe her eyes . He was one of the Nazi guards who used to stand duty in the women 's shower room at Ravensbriick . " The man reached out to shake Corrie 's hand . Corrie froze , unable to take his hand . The horror of the camp and the brutal death of her sister leaped back into her memory . She was filled with resentment and deep hatred . " Corrie could n't believe her own response . She had just given a moving talk on forgiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She // Si was emotionally blocked , physically paralyzed , unable to shake the former guard 's hand . " That experience was not unique to Corrie ten Boom . Many of us find it very hard to forgive someone else  --  especially a person who has maliciously or intentionally hurt us . " Our emotions may be so scarred that it seems superhuman to be able to forgive . " Let me go back to Corrie 's story . As she stood there , frozen , immobile , she began to pray silently : ' Jesus , I can not forgive this man . Give me your forgiveness . ' " At that moment , she said , her hand , as if empowered by another source , took the guard 's right hand in true forgiveness . At that moment she discovered a great truth . " It is not on ' our ' forgiveness that healing in our world hinges , but on ' His . ' When Jesus commands us to love our enemies , and to forgive those who have offended us , He also gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When cousin Ery finished his sermon , he graciously invited me to share the pulpit with him for a few minutes to talk about AIDS and the need for monogamous blood donors . You could n't find a better town in America to find monogamous couples by the thousands , and Ery agreed this was fertile territory . The talk yielded two blood-transfusion recipients who volunteered for the free and confidential AIDS test in the AIDS MOBILE that had brought us to Holland . ( We had , with not a little daring , parked it right outside in the parish parking lot of this venerable church . ) Our volunteers pledged to donate blood if they were AIDS antibody negative . Before the worship service , we had been introduced to Norma Killilea , who told us she had tested 109 persons in the Ottawa County ( Holland , Michigan ) environs and had found 5 antibody-positive individuals . She also said that they had turned away 50 people because of limited funding . These 50 people did n't seem to have enough risk factors to warrant spending government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roorda to let us leave enough free test kits in the church offices to take care of // the 50 people if they wanted to come to the church to pick them up . He readily agreed . We believe that the test should be available for all those who believe they need one . Circa 1937 As we ponder the enormity of the AIDS plague of our country , we could well look at a very similar medical catastrophe our country suffered exactly 50 years ago . It was in this very city  --  Holland , Michigan  --  that the famous Dr. Paul de Kruif cleverly mobilized scientists and the public to strike out against syphilis . He knew that we needed to test the population and that we needed a referendum or poll of all the citizens in order to prove they did indeed want to be tested . Dr. de Kruif 's story makes our AIDS disaster resemble dej ' ? vu . His account of a syphilis referendum and dragnet screening appeared in the November 1937 Ladies ' Home Journal . He wrote about it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratories , working with public-health officials , and badgering those who made the rules in the city halls . If you read it , you will marvel about how history has repeated itself  --  and how our health officers then responded in much the same manner they have today to our AIDS dilemma . Another Paul de Kruif is needed today ! Dr. de Kruif was more than an activist with his pen . At the age of 25 , when most scientists are considered unweaned , de Kruif had become the youngest assistant professor at the University of Michigan , in whose medical school he taught bacteriology . At 26 , he had achieved his doctorate in bacteriology . As a bacteriology associate at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , he had performed a major investigation that still stands at the scientific frontier in its field . There it was that this creative , unconventional young genius wrote Our Medicine Men , a book whose characters were thinly disguised portraits of some of his colleagues at the institute . Obviously he would have to be fired ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To soften the blow , de Kruif 's boss offered to get him a research job elsewhere if he promised to behave and utter no more Indian war cries . Young de Kruif thanked his chief , and he firmly declined the offer , saying he never expected to behave  --  in that way , at least ? " until he was six feet under . " The loss to medical research became a gain for truth and for the right of every American to receive the best of medical care . The healthy and hearty Dutch extrovert , whose 230 pounds exuded a bursting energy , wasa familiar figure in his hometown of Holland , Michigan , tramping the shores of his beloved Lake Michigan with his wife and their huge Great Dane . Here he penned his attacks against disease and death , both of which he considered his personal enemies . Syphilis was to become his public enemy No. 1 . He wrote that among 33,000 persons in six Southern states , one out of every five was syphilitic . In Macon County , Alabama , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found infected ; one adolescent out of every three , one young adult out of every two . Fifty years ago Surgeon General Thomas Parran did for the word " syphilis " what our Surgeon General Koop is doing for " condoms . " We want you to read Paul de Kruif 's words as they appeared in 1937 : " Dr. 0 . C. Wenger a syphilis specialist with the U.S. Public Health Service obtained permission to sweep a whole Southern county with his blood-test dragnet a 1930s-style " Syphilis Mobile " . " Churches , schools were their clinics , and , failing these , the tests were taken at the ends of cotton rows under the hot sky . The money for this testing was furnished by a private foundation . FREE BLOOD TEST BY GOVERNMENT DOCTORS AND FREE ICE WATER " This sign on their auto lured the rural people . On Sundays , to get them en masse , Wenger and his crew invaded Southern churches ; in the middle of the sacred service asked the pastor to step down from his pulpit ; had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ; then gentlemen , ladies , and children ; then thanks very much , good-by , and go on with your sermon . " This way , here for the first time in our history , were facts , not figures . And this fact was that one man , // woman , child , out of every four , was infected with syphilis . Here was , without question , a menace more formidable than malaria , hookworm , or pellagra . " So now , in six counties in six Southern states , in 1930-31 , the health officers of the counties , a few nurses , a few volunteer doctors dragged a giant seine to search the . . . populations for syphilis . " The results were terrible and terribly hopeful . " The facts blew all the old statistics  --  mere figures  --  to smithereens . In 1926 , a one-day census had been taken by the American Social Hygiene Association , among doctors ; it looked impressive because it represented almost 25 million of our population . The doctors were asked how many patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment or observation for syphilis . Only four out of every thousand for whites , only seven out of every thousand for blacks ; that was the alleged prevalence . " Not too alarming . But now here were the facts from Dr. Wenger 's blood-test dragnet : two hundred in every thousand , for blacks : twenty-five times the syphilis reported by the doctors ! " But what would a mass blood test show for whites ? Would it be that awful ? What would be the facts ? Nobody knew . Would you find any syphilis among the so-called ' better class ' ? No ? Well  --  there was this embarrassing bit of news : when the blood test was applied to candidates for West Point , these boys  --  cream of our young manhood  --  were found in-fected , one out of 20 ! " " Nowhere in our land had syphilis been fought as a contagious sickness , like TB or smallpox . There had been sermons against it , yes , but not the blood tests to find it . . . . Vast sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jails , poorhouses its late consequences helped to fill . But when real fighting money was begged for , to blood-test , to treat early dangerous cases , to follow up these human menaces , to spot all imperiled , to let our health men know how many and where --  " Then came Surgeon General Par-ran , adventuring . He dared to speak from his high position as generalissimo of our nation 's health men . Writing in. . . a popular magazine what was before mumbled only in halls of science , he courted disgrace because what he sought to fight was itself so disgraceful , so unmentionably shameful . He found this fact : that the mass of America 's people are not stupid if only you do not act as if you so regard them . " Parran now said , to millions , let 's call it syphilis and let 's get rid of it . . . . Upon the secret sneakings of the syphilis spirochete he turned a bright , clean beam of universal knowledge . " Chicago was the first of all the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . In June 1937 , that city  --  where anything may happen , and usually does  --  launched the most formidable people 's fight for the people 's life that has ever been attempted by any American community against any sickness whatsoever . " This fight against the syphilis of America 's second city began in a most fantastic manner  --  in a little hillbilly town in Arkansas in the foothills of the Ozarks . To this town , one evening in June , Dr. 0 . C. Wenger had gone , to meet the doctors of the county medical society , to ask them whether they , in their practices , would take a syphilis blood test , routinely , on every last one of their patients , no matter what their sickness . He wanted to make it the first county dragnet in history . " The leading doctor of the county demurred . He said they 'd do it , but they must n't tell their patients for what their blood was being taken . ' Otherwise my class of patients would n't stand for it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with deep , true , human insight ? was present , and she now spoke up in meeting . What would happen , this woman asked the doctor , if the people , all the people of his county , were asked , by referendum , whether they would be willing to have a free blood test , for syphilis , taken in strict confidence by their own doctor ? That innocent little question  --  outlandishly  --  was the beginning of Chicago 's present great syphilis fight . For Wenger , hearing this remark , blazed into action , forgot about the Arkansas county , and said , ' We 'll put that question before the people of Chicago ! ' " Within forty-eight hours Wenger // took this audacious proposition to Chicago . It was a challenge never before faced by any health man in the country . " The result of it is now death-fighting history in the making . This fantastic referendum was sponsored by the U.S. Public Health Service , the Illinois State Department of Health , and the Chicago Board of Health . IN STRICT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIKE TO BE GIVEN BY YOUR OWN PHYSICIAN , A BLOOD TEST FOR SYPHILIS ? YES NO ( PLEASE CHECK ONE . ) " This ballot was mailed to over half a million of the property owners of Chicago . The WPA Works Progress Administration transformed itself into an emergency death-fighting organization and furnished an army of clerks , expert statisticians and the millions of envelopes that were needed . The U.S. Post Office Department franked the envelopes sent to voters and to be returned by them . " The replies rolled in by scores of thousands , in a percentage extraordinarily high for such a questionnaire sent through the mails . The sentiment expressed was an overwhelming : " ' Yes , we will be willing to take such a blood test . ' " That is Chicago 's thumping reply , in a proportion of 30 to 1 of those voting ! " And the no 's , ' when analyzed , are in a great majority explained by the voters in writing on their ballots . They have just had a blood test . Or they are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syphilis and are now under treatment by their doctors . " Only a few no 's ' are genuine ones . Some people protest that this should be a private matter between themselves and their physician . The real number who say , ' Yes , we 'll take this test , ' is close to 95 out of 100 . " This is the voice of Chicago 's people , 3,500,000 strong . There is no doubt they are back of their health men , their doctors , in this great effort to find hidden syphilis . They want to begin the working of Wenger 's blood-test dragnet . They want to put Chicago 's population through a giant , syphilis-finding sieve . " The voice of Chicago 's physicians is no less certain . The Council of the Chicago Medical Society has unanimously voted that it is in favor of making Chicago 's doctors public-health men . The doctors are going to be volunteer front-line fighters . They are going to test the blood of Chicago 's people . " At this moment plans are under way for Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by experts from the city and state health departments , to begin the operation of this city-wide dragnet . It will be in full swing as you read this . But before you offer the blood test to 3,500,000 people , free , before you get the blood , you have got to get the money . And this is already recognized by Chicago 's city fathers . Her mayor and councilmen have already budgeted the first $50,000 for this undertaking . " Ferreting out the syphilitics would prove to be a money-saving move . Syphilis was costing the city of Chicago many millions of dollars to keep the victims in hospitals , jails , and all the other institutions to maintain them and their families on welfare lists and relief rolls . " Early contagious syphilis , " Dr. Wenger stated , " is a fire . Millions of our citizens can not pay for the blood tests or the needed treatment that will make them no longer dangerous to others . And what would be sillier , if you want to save your community , than only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for the fire department to come ? " Wenger 's words could just as well have been applied to our present predicament . As we said , much of this dramatic story was inspired by the gifted pen of Dr. Paul de Kruif , who was able to bring the fight against disease out of the cloistered laboratories and musty libraries , out from behind the hush-hush facades , and into the hearts and minds of millions of people . If you would like to receive the unabridged article by Paul de Kruif as it appeared in the November 1937 Ladies ' Home Journal , please write to the Society for a copy . Circa 1987 There is another Dutch fellow who inhabits Holland , Michigan , and enjoys Lake Michigan and who is just as incisive in pointing a finger at our AIDS problem as Paul de Kruif was 50 years ago about syphilis . He is n't a writer , but he 's a communicator as powerful as de Kruif ever was . After listening silently for several days of briefing on AIDS , at the conclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked one simple question , and the entire press corps converged upon him as the meeting adjourned . The Wall Street Journal reported : " Amway Corp . chief Richard DeVos has described succinctly the issue of public skepticism about AIDS . Federal officials suffer from a credibility gap ' among people ' outside the Beltway , ' he told reporters . ' Why is it that with all this knowledge and expertise , the American people are n't buying it ? ' " We are attempting to persuade the great communicator Rich DeVos to put an AIDS questionnaire out to all of his legions of Amway distributors to ask them what they think should be done . Your Society is going to the Magazine Publishers Association to solicit its help in persuading all magazine publishers to insert a questionnaire to poll their readers . Magazine publishers know a good deal about their readers because advertisers want to have the facts about the people they choose to receive their message . They pay a lot of money to reach certain people with certain habits . Magazine readers ' responses would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " cohort " from which the answers came . From a wide variety of magazine readers , we could learn a great deal about the " sticky wicket " decisions looming ever large before us . Delayed actions are deadly . There is no more time for waffling or " wimpy " back-pedaling or avoiding decisions . It is a time for learning the true extent of the AIDS epidemic . The public can handle the truth ! Controversial issues make decisions painful , but they must be made . Every day we wait , we are letting more people become infected . The decisions must be made with the medical truths and by an informed public . We must look at the overall welfare when we examine the legislation being proposed in every state , in our Congress , and for better or for worse we must make choices , bite the bullet , and take action as a nation at war . We have listed here the first 5,303 Anonymous AIDS Questionnaire answers from you . We believe some of the answers will surprise you . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surveys to the diverse populace of our country , // please let us know . If you have additional questions you would like to include in taking this poll , please send them to us . Society members have a right to know the truth about our free AIDS testing program . In an effort to discredit President Reagan for his selections for the presidential AIDS commission , the press has made false accusations about several of the commission members . Our free testing program has been erroneously criticized . For example , we have never notified a single AIDS-positive person by mail , as some reports claim . Any such person has been notified by his or her own physician or ours , and in a completely confidential manner . Our belief is that some counseling guidelines were set up for high-risk persons who need a great deal of time-consuming counseling even after a negative test result . A negative test result is good only if the antibodies were there to be tested ; high-risk people who continue in dangerous practices must be tested again and again . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lifestyles . The Society tests blood-transfusion recipients who do not need to change 554 their lifestyles and who can be told the meaning of a negative test in pretest counseling and by mail . We believe you should monitor the legislation in your states to make sure we get guidelines rewritten to accommodate efficient testing of persons who are not in need of changing their lifestyles . Can you imagine the folly of spending precious AIDS budgets to counsel a seven-year-old boy or his parents about changing his lifestyle after he receives a negative AIDS test result ? A test he was given because his parents were uneasy about a blood transfusion he had in New York City ? Suppose your grandmother wanted an AIDS test after her hip surgery and blood transfusions . Would you deny her peace of mind because there was n't sufficient budget for post-test counseling if she was negative ? Of course not ! But if we are n't careful we will be boxed into a corner with " guidelines " ? or worse still , laws  --  about testing that will make it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Society has been called uncaring because our free testing is done only for the blood-transfusion pa-tients and the women con-templating pregnancy . We test these low-risk groups that do not need to change their lifestyles because it is our firm conviction that these people can be conveniently and confidentially told by mail that they are AIDS-anti-body negative . Our descriptive infor-mation about negative AIDS anti-body tests helps them to make deci-sions concerning pregnancy and sex-ual activity after blood transfusions . We think it is important for our readers not to be misled by frequently repeated , inaccurate myths about false positive tests . Such myths are often used as an excuse for not advocating voluntary testing . From published scientific sources , we can make a couple of definitive statements about Human Immunodecontinued on page 109 Sisters of Forgiveness continued from page 55 ficiency Virus ( AIDS ) testing . 1 . Only confirmed positive results are used to inform low-risk individuals that they are infected . A confirmed positive consists of a repeat-ably reactive ELISA , plus a positive Western blot . 2 . The specificity of confirmed positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only one to five false positives will be found in each 100,000 persons who test negative . This rate is at least as good as any diagnostic test in medicine . Further confirming tests using alternative technology can reduce this to at most one false positive in 1 million tests . The bottom line is : a positive AIDS test can be rechecked and the virus can be cultured from the blood to confirm it . The Western blot positive result is extremely accurate . On the other hand , a negative antibody test at a blood bank may mean only that the antibodies are n't yet evident  --  but if the virus is there , the blood will infect the person who receives it . For Women Only : SOFT AIDS go to churches and women 's organizations to urge them to organize blood drives . Far less than half our blood donors today are women . Yet , on the whole , women 's blood is likely to be safer . If you belong to women 's clubs  --  such as the Soroptimists ; the League of Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) ; the National Federation of Republican Women or the National Federation of Democratic Women ; the American Legion Auxiliary ; or service organizations or auxiliaries not mentioned  --  help SOFT AIDS in mobilizing your membership to sponsor blood drives for your local blood banks . Men aged 20 to 50 are likely to be more active sexually than any other group . Ironically , they give more blood than any other group of Americans . If we could obtain enough monogamous senior citizens whose doctors agree can donate blood , we could stop excluding those over 65 and also consider taking blood  --  less blood  --  from women who weigh less than 110 continued on following page pounds and who are now excluded . I asked a blood-bank manager why we simply do n't take three-quarters of a unit from a smaller woman or from a senior citizen . The answer was that the anticoagulant was measured in the bags for the full unit . Perhaps the industry could begin requesting some bags with three-quarters as much anticoagulant for little women . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all seriousness , " What do you do with the needles when you are through with them ? " It was a legitimate question . We need to emphasize to the public that we incinerate all needles after they have been used . On the AIDS MOBILE the needles are placed , without recapping them , into a red container from which they can not be removed . The entire container is incinerated when the AIDS MOBILE reaches home base . Blood banks  --  the Red Cross , independent blood banks , and hospital blood banks  --  all use disposable needles . The donor can see that the needle is a new , unused one . If you want to join in teaching the blood bank 's message , write to SOFT AIDS P.O.
