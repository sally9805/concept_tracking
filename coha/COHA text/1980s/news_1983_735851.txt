txt Three trustees of Kenilworth Realty Liquidating Trust bought units in the trust for themselves from the largest holder while selling trust assets to the same holder , according to an opinion by a law firm Kenilworth hired . The trustees have agreed to return any profit on the purchase to the trust . But they disputed the law firm 's conclusion that they violated the trust agreement and breached their fiduciary duties as trustees . Neither charges nor lawsuits have been brought against the trustees , who have denied any wrongdoing . In a statement responding to the law firm report , Kenilworth 's managing trustee . Carl Glick , said the author " based his conclusions on the strictest possible interpretation of the trustees ' fiduciary duties . . . " He called the two transactions " separate and independent . " A spokesman for the three trustees said none of them was immediately available to elaborate , on the statement . Kenilwordi hired the outside law firm of Sullivan &; Cromwell for the investigation . The Sullivan &; Cromwell report identified Mr. Glick . Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weber formerly was vice president , finance , of Chock Full O'Nuts Corp . Kenilworth is the successor in liquidation to C.I . Realty Investors , formerly controlled by City Investing Co . A group of investors led by David .1 . Greene &; Co. that included Jerome Greene . no relation . and Carl Glick bought part of City Investing 's controlling 21% share in 1979. and the next year holders approved a liquidation plan . After a year , unsold assets were transferred to Kenilworth . The outside firm was hired for the investigation at the instigation of Alan Greene , son of the late David J. Greene and managing director of the Greene firm ; whose group still owns about 15% of the trust units . - According to the report , the trust sold one of its principal remaining assets , a mortgage on a Holiday Inn in a suburb of Cleveland . on May 16 , 1983 , for $4 million to American Financial Corp. , a Cleveland financial-services company headed by Carl Lindner . On the same day . American Financial sold the three trustees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $4.50 a share , or $1,867.500 . The report says Mr. Glick later estimated the units would pay out as much as $8.50 a share . The Sullivan &; Cromwell report , dated Nov. 28 , concluded that $4 million was a reasonable price for American Financial to have paid for the mortgage . But it said the trustees violated the trust agreement by allowing the sale of the units , which technically ca n't be sold while the trust is in liquidation . It also said the trustees breached their fi- duciary chiles by placing themselves in a conflict-of-interest position in combining the purchase of the units and the asset sale , and by failing to disclose their personal purchase of the units from American Financial . It noted that American Financial executives considered the two transactions " directly related . " One executive , the report noted , did n't know American Financial was selling the units to the trustees and thought the concern was selling the units back to Kenilworth in a swap for the hotel mortgage plus cash . Jerome Greene was counsel at Kenilworth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spokesman for the firm said Mr. Greene resigned last week under a prior agreement to do so " if Sullivan &; Cromwell found that his conduct gave the trust any legal rights against the trustees , " such as to recover the trustees ' sale profits . Following the Rosenman Colin firm 's disclosure , a lawyer for Jerome Greene issued a statement on his behalf that said in part , " He was not a party to the negotiating process which culminated in the transactions and was unaware of some of the communications between the purchaser and the seller . " The report noted that the trustees are n't allowed to engage in any trade or'business and are charged with the sole purpose of liquidating the trust for the beneficiaries . The report said trustees ca n't put themselves in a position where their personal interest might conflict with that of the beneficiaries . And it said trustees are n't allowed to benefit personally from knowledge acquired in the course of their duties .                @ @ @ @ @
