THE YALE MURDER by Peter Meyer Empire Books ; 302 pages ; $12.95 THE KILLING OF BONNIE GARLAND : A QUESTION OF JUSTICE by Willard Gaylin Simon &; Schuster ; 366 pages ; $16.50 <P> It is a clich of crime reporting that the murderer is described as polite , gentle and law-abiding . Richard Herrin , a courteous , religious chicano who had made it through Yale , certainly fit the nice-guy stereotype-at least until July 7 , 1977 . That morning , at the Scarsdale , N.Y. , home of his girlfriend , Bonnie Garland , 20 , Herrin , 23 , smashed Bonnie 's skull with a hammer as she slept . A few hours later , half-naked and covered in her blood , he surrendered to police in upstate New York , confessing that he had killed her . <P> It seemed , in another crime writer 's bromide , to be an open-and-shut case . Yet only 35 days later Herrin was out on bail , living in a community of Christian Brothers and attending class at a nearby university . In June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first-degree manslaughter . He has now served almost half of a prison sentence of eight years , four months . In the words of Bonnie 's father , Attorney Paul Garland , " Richard Herrin has successfully got away with murder . " <P> As Authors Peter Meyer and Willard Gaylin make abundantly clear in their equally compelling accounts of the case , what actually happened that morning in Bonnie 's bedroom was to have less bearing on subsequent events than what had gone before . Bonnie , an affectionate , vivacious woman with a mane of red hair and a fine soprano voice , came from a well-to-do suburban family . Richard , an illegitimate child , was a product of the Los Angeles barrio . The lovers met at Yale , of which Bonnie 's father was a prominent alumnus ; she was a freshman and Richard was a senior . Despite the differences in their interests and background , and opposition from her parents , the romance lasted 2 years before Bonnie wanted out . <P> <P> Except for Bonnie , Herrin had no close friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates , faculty members and , particularly , the university 's Roman Catholic community rallied immediately to his side with a $30,000 defense fund and all the influence they could bring to bear . New Yorker Jack : Litman , a stellar attorney , was hired to ' provide a defense . His case ultimately de pended on Psychiatrist John Train , another brilliant performer on the criminal circuit , who argued that Herrin was suffering from both severe mental disease that impaired his ability to realize what le was doing . ( Herrin testified repeatedly that he " was n't feeling anything " when lie set out to kill his lover . ) Thus , Gaylin points out , Litman was actually arguing two incompatible cases : " Not guilty by reason of insanity ; or if guilty , only of manslaughter . " <P> The prosecutor , with his moralistic oratory and his psychiatrist , who essentially agreed with the defense case , was no match for Litman . " In the end , " a juror summed up , " it came down to whether . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonnie 's mother Joan had a different interpretation : " If you have a $30,000 defense fund , a Yale connection and a clergy connection , you 're entitled to one free hammer murder .
