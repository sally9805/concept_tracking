President Reagan proposes to cut off all funding for the nine federal-state planning and economic development agencies beyond next Sept. 30  --  the end of the current fiscal year. // And if the nation ' s new Chief Executive has his way , funding authorizations for the last half of fiscal 1981 will be virtually eliminated as well. // Reagan-proposed budget trims , sent to Congress on March 10 , all but assure a speedy demise of the special commissions whose varying activities and jurisdictions embrace parts or all of 43 states. // Since 1965 , the federal government has supplied nearly $5. 2 billion to run the commissions  --  $4. 5 billion for Appalachia and close to $650 million combined for the other regions. // While disappointed over the presidential decision and hopeful most of the money previously appropriated for fiscal 1981 will be forthcoming , governors of the states involved and officials of the regional commissions appear all but resigned to the demise of the agencies. // With the possible exception of the Appalachian Regional Commission , which serves West Virginia and portions of 12 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects for continuing this federal aid partnership  --  even on a scaled-down basis  --  seem slim. // The Appalachian commission , the first and by far the largest of the regional planning and development agencies , has hundreds of miles of highways and 706 other projects under construction or on the drawing boards . These would be jeopardized if Congress went along with Reagan ' s fiscal 1981 budget chopping. // Specifically , the President ' s recommendations include : // * Cutting all but about $4. 7 million from the $124. 7 million appropriated for nonhighway Appalachian commission projects , and shifting all unexpended Appalachian highway money to the Federal Highway Administration. // * Reducing fiscal 1981 funding for the other eight regional commissions by $21 million from $43. 8 million which has been authorized. // * Halting funds for all nine commissions in fiscal 1982. // Before leaving office in January , former President Jimmy Carter submitted a budget for fiscal 1982 which would have cut all funding for eight of the agencies , while recommending that $343 million be given to the Appalachian commission. // Although similar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same programs , and they vary widely in both scope and effectiveness. // Some agencies , like the New England Regional Commission , have been under fire over the years for striking out in too many directions , with little to show in positive results . Some have had the image of being political " pork barrels. " // Critics of the nine commissions say the approach has not worked well , with efforts in many instances directed more toward dealing with problems on an individual state rather than regionwide basis . Others maintain that too much time and attention has been directed toward things that might better be handled by other public and private agencies. // From the outset , each of these planning agencies has been a two-headed operation  --  with one co-chairman appointed by the White House and the other rotated among the governors of the member states . In this way the federal government has had a voice equal to the states in deciding which policies and programs are undertaken. // This arrangement , however , could pose a problem in the expected phasing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dismissed. // With President Reagan not likely to fill any of these choice patronage slots , it is unclear how the governor co-chairmen can unilaterally decide which projects might continue with remaining funds . " This will have the effect of preventing new spending , even if we had the money , " laments the staff director of one of the larger regional commissions. // Most , if not all , of the apparently doomed agencies have , according to spokesmen , substantially committed their full fiscal 1982 appropriations and will face contract cancellations as well as early staff dismissals. // The Appalachian commission , for example , has a staff of 115 , and the eight smaller commissions have a combined state and federally funded payroll of just over 150. // Some of these agencies ' activities  --  such as tourism promotion , industrial development , and energy resource coordination  --  seem almost sure to be shifted elsewhere , either through private enterprise or other government agencies. // Governors in most of the regions already are discussing means for continuing some commission activities , although perhaps scaled down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having worked closely in developing policies and programs for the mutual benefit of the region as well as individual states , I expect the New England governors will continue their joint effort , even without the commission , " says J. Joseph Grandsmaison , the New England commission ' s former co-chairman. // Despite wide differences both in emphasis and scope of activity , ranging from reclamation of arid lands in the Southwest to development of seafood industrial parks along the South Atlantic coast , all commissions have been heavily into promoting tourism. // Several agencies have focused attention on expanding overseas markets for their regions ' products. // Some of the commissions , most notably the Appalachian and Ozark divisions , spearheaded construction of vocational schools. // Since its inception in 1965 , the Appalachian commission has helped create more than 500 of these job-training facilities within its region. // Appalachian governors , concerned over the plight of their region ' s $120 million fiscal 1981 program in the face of the Reagan cutback proposals , met with the President last month but apparently to no avail. // The regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal-state-local cooperation President Reagan is seeking . " The program in Appalachia , as they view it , is making " substantial and visible progress " and " reversing decades of neglect. " // Congress now has until late spring to move on Reagan ' s budget-slimming recommendations for fiscal 1981 . If the lawmakers fail to act , the funding stands as appropriated . <> The regional commissions // Appalachian Regional Commission : portions of Alabama , Georgia , Kentucky , Maryland , Mississippi , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Tennessee , and Virginia , plus all of West Virginia. // Coastal plains Regional Commission : eastern portions of Florida , Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Virginia. // Four Corners Regional Commission : portions of Arizona , Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico , and Utah. // New England Regional Commission : Connecticut , Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Vermont. // Old West Regional Commission : Montana , Nebraska , North Dakota , South Dakota , and Wyoming. // Ozark Regional Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma , and much of Texas. // Pacific Northwest Regional Commission : Idaho , Oregon , and Washington. // Southwest Border Regional Commission : counties along the Mexican border in Arizona , California , New Mexico , and Texas. // Upper Great Lakes Regional commission : northern counties of Michigan , Minne sota , and Wisconsin. // //
