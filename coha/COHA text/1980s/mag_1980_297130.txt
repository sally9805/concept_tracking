U.S. dentists find the cavities are in the chair , not the teeth <P> Dr. William Schmidt , 35 , of San Jose , Calif. , is a successful dentist . If that description conjures up nervous waits in a bland , Muzak-filled office and a white-coated figure poking fingers , drills or needles into the patient 's mouth , with possibly a palliative lollipop or pat on the back afterward , forget it . Dr. Schmidt practices his profession in a red cape and bright blue tights . He calls himself " Plaque Invader . " The cape outfit is only one of twelve costumes he dons to amuse young patients . At Christmas he may be dressed as Santa Claus , and around July 4 as Uncle Sam . Schmidt drives to and from work in a vehicle that he calls a " Plaquemobile , " a white Volkswagen topped by a king-size Styrofoam molar . <P> Adults have their own treats at Schmidt 's office : chances to win record albums , dinner at a local restaurant or a turkey . He offers a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a relaxing soak in the office hot tub . Says Dr. Schmidt : " We 've kept our name circulating in the community because of what we are doing . The more the name is mentioned in the community , the more likely we are to pick up a patient . " <P> Picking up patients is a serious business for the nation 's 130,226 tooth doctors . Lately they have been seeing more cavities in their chairs than in their patients ' mouths . They face what for them is an alarming trend : the prospect of fewer patients and better teeth . In the late 1960s , a survey by the American Dental Association found that 14% of dentists " would like more patients . " Ten years later , 21% of dentists had come to the same conclusion . Still the average annual net income of U.S. dentists is around $42,000 . <P> In the past decade the number of dentists climbed 31% , while the country 's population rose by less than 10% . Especially hard-hit demographically are the orthodontists . The prime candidates for high-priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of youngsters in this age bracket fell by 4 million . Dentists are quick to point out that fees have barely kept pace with inflation , but the stalled economy has kept people away from the chair . <P> Dentists are also victims of their own success . With improved equipment like high-speed drills , tooth capping and other repairs can be accomplished in a fraction of the time once needed . Preventive oral hygiene has also paid off in healthier teeth . The three-decades-old program of adding fluoride to drinking water has had dramatic impact on cavities-and so have fluoride toothpastes . An A.D.A . survey shows that a child who drinks fluoridated water from birth to age 14 develops 60% fewer cavities than a youngster who drinks unfluoridated water . <P> The outlook for dentists is not totally bleak . More and more companies are offering dental insurance as part of employee benefit programs . Seventy-five million people are now covered by insurance , more than twice as many as in 1975 .
