Undoing Watergate reforms <P> Americans in the mid-1970s winced through Watergate , the Lockheed Aircraft Corp . foreign bribery case , corporate indictments for illegal campaign contributions and seemingly endless scandals involving the FBI , CIA or IRS . On the theory that secrecy was the thread linking corruption , and full disclosure was the sword to cut it , Congress between 1974 and 1977 created the Federal Election Commission , broadened the Freedom of Information Act and toughened the ethics and disclosure laws for federal appointees . Corporations were compelled to record and disclose anything that might be construed as a bribe . The FBI and CIA were restricted , especially with respect to wiretaps . The only move toward greater secrecy was a restriction on Government access to taxpayer records , because President Nixon had used IRS audits and prosecutions to punish dissent . <P> The Reagan Administration may well be deciding that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing and a lot of knowledge is a very dangerous thing . Secrecy is back in favor-although it is now called " privacy . " Every major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either as an unwarranted intrusion by Government or as an ill-advised restraint on Government 's pursuit of crime . Reformers concede that many criticisms are valid but argue for revision not repeal . <P> Among the laws most likely to change : <P> Freedom of Information Act . Passed by Congress in 1966 and amended in 1974 , the law was intended to open Government records to citizens ' groups , journalists and scholars . Instead , many more requests come either from prisoners trying to find out which informant might have fingered them for prosecution or from businesses , often practicing an entirely legal form of industrial espionage . Companies can file requests for trade information through intermediaries , so that rivals are unable to discover who is checking on them . The Justice Department also claims that the law is easily misused by foreign spies . In 1974 Congress estimated that it would cost $100,000 annually to enforce FOIA ; two years ago , a survey indicated the law costs about $45 million . The shape of any Reagan bill is unclear . Attorney General William French Smith says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars . <P> Ethics in Government Act . The act , which included provision for special prosecutors , was created to prevent another Watergate cover-up by a politically tainted Justice Department . It led to long , sensationalized and fruitless investigations of alleged cocaine use by two of Carter 's White House aides , Hamilton Jordan and Tim Kraft . Under the act , the Attorney General must ask a special court unit to name a prosecutor whenever there is " specific information " lodged against any of some 240 top officials , whether or not it meets the legal standard of " probable cause " to believe a crime has been committed . Attorney General Smith argues that the act is unconstitutional and wants to abolish it ; Benjamin Civiletti , Attorney General under Carter , says the law 's scope should be reduced .
