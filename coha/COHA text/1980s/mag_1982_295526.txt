THE RED SMITH READER Edited by Dave Anderson Random House ; 308 pages ; $15.95 <P> TO ABSENT FRIENDS FROM RED SMITH by Red Smith Atheneum ; 478 pages ; $17.95 riling a column is easy , " he used to say . " You just sit at your typewriter until little drops of blood appear on your forehead . " <P> The job must have had its masochistic charms , because Red Smith never wanted to be anything but a " newspaper stiff . " He started on the news side in Milwaukee in 1927 , shifted to sports two years later in St. Louis , then spent ten years covering Connie Mack 's Athletics for the old Philadelphia Record . He went to New York in 1945 , when writing sports in the Big Town was like playing the Palace . First at the Herald Tribune , and for the last ten years of his life at the New York Times , he turned out a syndicated column that was the envy of every sportswriter . <P> Smith covered the big games , races and fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What counted was the sights and smells , the cadences of conversation , the laughter of old friends . Precious anecdotes were salted away and used again years later . This ability to call up the past gave his columns a resonance that has grown rare in daily journalism . To be sure , some of the 300-odd pieces gathered in these two volumes should have been left in yesterday 's newspaper . But most are timeless , literate and witty enough to appeal to readers who do not know the backstretch from the front nine . <P> As The Red Smith Reader generously demonstrates , the columnist preferred to write about athletes with a touch of the rogue . His portrait of Babe Ruth is a small masterpiece . It ends with two Yankee teammates , Waite Hoyt and Joe Dugan , sitting together at Ruth 's funeral on a sweltering day in 1948 . " I 'd give a hundred dollars for a cold beer , " Dugan whispers . " So would the Babe , " Hoyt replies . <P> Smith was most at home at the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting Ascot . " Half the royal family was on the premises , " he writes in 1960 , " and horseplayers were being so polite their teeth hurt . " He savors " the soft afternoons under the old elms of Saratoga " and the memories of great races , like the 1941 Preakness : " Whirlaway came loping along counting the house with Arcaro sitting still as a bluepoint on the half-shell . " To Smith , horses are people with four legs and wonderful names . What a pleasure to learn that a colt by the French stallion Compte de Grasse is named Mow de Lawn . <P> Smith had less patience with twolegged animals , particularly when they ran athletics into the ground . George Steinbrenner was George III . Avery Brundage and his flunkies on the International Olympic Committee were the " waxworks . " He idolized owners like Connie Mack and Branch Rickey but later sided with the players " in the slave cabins . "                    @
