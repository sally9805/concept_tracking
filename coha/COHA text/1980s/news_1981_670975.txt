For generations , black people from all over north-central Texas have flocked to Booker T. Washington Park on June 19 for the joyous observance of a holiday , marked only in to Texas , called Juneteenth . It is the anniversary of the day in 1865 when word of Abraham Lincoln ' s Emancipation Proclamation was delivered to Texas . And they came on this June 19 , some 5 , 000 in all , back to the grassy , oakshaded shores of Lake Mexia. // In the dark , three sheriff ' s deputies , two white and one black , set out from their temporary command post in a red cabin across the narrow lake from the party . Unable to get across the only bridge because of the crowd , they crossed the lake by boat . On the other side they arrested three teen-agers , all black , on charges of possessing marijuana and pills. // The deputies had the youths climb into their low-sided , 14-foot metal boat , which , according to later testimony , was certified by the Coast Guard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , the boat swamped and capsized . Two of the deputies swam to safety while the third , a nonswimmer , clung to the overturned boat " like a spider , " in the words of one witness , and was later rescued . <> <> Report of Handcuffs // All three youths drowned , although two were said to be good swimmers . There were no life jackets in the boat . The black deputy , Kenneth Archie , according to The Dallas Times-Herald , said that two of the prisoners had been handcuffed together . But in a judicial inquiry that ended here yesterday he took the Fifth Amendment . Some witnesses said that all the youths had been handcuffed , but other testimony disputed this. // The mystery remains despite the three days of hearings , which are said to have ventilated the issue enough to damp tensions in the substantial black population hereabouts . Now the matter is up to a grand jury , scheduled to meet next month , and Richard L. Dockery , the Dallas-based Southernwestern regional director of the National Association for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not risk a suggestion " as to what might happen if no indictments are returned. // " It ' s very strange that excellent swimmers would drown in a little , small lake like that , " Mr. Dockery said , adding that " many local residents have strong reservations about what they have heard " and displayed " an intense desire for what they believe to be justice. " // " Those officers are the only ones who know about what happened out there , " said Lois Colbert , who lives a few yards from the scene but could not clearly see what was going on because of the darkness . <> <> Evidence of Negligence Seen // A special prosecutor from Dallas , Larry Baraka , a 31-year-old black lawyer , said he believed enough evidence had been produced to obtain indictments of negligent homicide against the three deputies : Mr. Archie and Kenny Elliott , both 23 years old , and David Drummond , 32 . Mr. Baraka said that he saw no evidence that the deaths had been intentionally caused or that any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dallas and Carl Baker of Mexia , both 19 years old ; and Anthony Freeman , 18 , of Mexia ( pronounced Muh-HAY-yuh ) . None have been described as troublemakers . In his statement to The Times-Herald , Mr. Archie said that " everywhere you looked , there was marijuana " at the Juneteenth party . He was quoted further as saying that the three youths had been randomly singled out for arrest. // Both the N.A.A.C.P. and the Justice Department ' s Civil Rights Division are investigating the incident for possible rights violations that might stem from the handling of the prisoners that night. // Mr. Drummond , the only one of the deputies to testify at the inquiry , said that none of the prisoners were handcuffed . He said that Mr. Booker and Mr. Baker were handcuffed together when arrested , as Mr. Archie had told the Dallas newspaper , but that the cuffs were removed before the youths got into the boat . Another witness said he saw officers remove handcuffs from at least one body when it was removed from the lake , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time . <> <> Observation in the Morgue // Three witnesses who saw Mr. Baker ' s body in a funeral home said that his hands were in a position of rigor mortis , close together in front of his body , which led them to believe that he had been handcuffed . But Dr. Kenneth Wittstruck , a pathologist who conducted autopsies , testified yesterday that there were no signs of handcuffing on any of them. // Yesterday , one week after Juneteenth and less than one day after the end of the inquiry , Carl Baker and Anthony Freeman , graduates of the Mexia High School , classes of 1980 and 1981 , respectively , were buried . Mourners filled the First Baptist Church . Marshals wearing N.A.A.C.P. armbands patrolled the aisles and vestibule . The theme was one of reconciliation. // " The greatest tribute we can give him , " B.T. Matthews said of Anthony Freeman , who had been his student in school , " is the building of a better life and a better community. " // When a deep baritone voice began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was the mother of one of the youths - dissolved in wracking sobs and had to be carried from the church. // Deputy Sheriff Elliott , the chief arresting officer on Juneteenth , has gone into seclusion and is said to be devastated . His superior , Limestone County Sheriff Dennis Walker , said that Mr. Elliott would be allowed as much time as he wanted " to get his emotions back together. " //
