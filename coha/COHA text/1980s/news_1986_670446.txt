The strategies of Trotsky are wielded now by garrulous City Hall incumbents with the sort of thrust that used to drive the dockers ' baling hooks , and paradoxically their effort is pointed at the heart of the Labor Party ' s hierarchy down in London. // " If somebody described me as a Marxist , one who recognizes the contributions of Marx to Socialist thought and the marvelous fight of Trotsky against Stalin , I ' d say that ' s right , " Tony Mulhearn was saying , downing some pasta with a swig of Perrier water . He seemed not at all defeated by his recent expulsion from the local Labor Party leadership by Neil Kinnock , the national Labor leader. // Mr. Kinnock is making a considerable effort to purge the party of what he denounces as " maggot " extremists who have been bedeviling him and the party ' s national image as he heads for a crucial attempt at becoming the next Prime Minister . Much more than embarrassment and party orthodoxy are at stake for him , since Prime Minister Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Party in the voter ' s eye as a group prey to fanatical ideas from " extreme left-wingers. " #9 Are Leader ' s Targets Mr. Kinnock ' s targets here are Mr. Mulhearn and eight other leaders of an aggressive , locally successful faction of the party called the Militant Tendency , which critics denounce as a dictatorial fifth column bent on exploiting the Labor Party for secret , dogmatic purposes. // The Militants , driven by the tenets of Marxism and the fervor that comes of this region ' s long-term unemployment , insist that they embody the party ' s original Socialist concerns , which they say have long since been muddled by national Labor leaders like Mr. Kinnock in searching for the safer middle ground of voter appeal. // The fight might be dismissed as academic were it not for the fact that the Militants typify various challengers within Labor to party moderates across the nation . Some analysts estimate that unless and until Mr. Kinnock ' s purge succeeds , a future Labor majority in the House of Commons might be dominated , 2 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Militants have been the driving force behind the local party ' s control of the city government . They have been the political " ins " for three years , rambunctious and proud , and they seem to welcome the higher political stakes of combat with Mr. Kinnock , saying his " witch hunt " will bring them fresh sympathy and political financing. // During incumbency , they have become embroiled in cliffhanging budget deficits and legalistic fights with the central Government . But the Militants of the City Council majority contend they have been building the democratic model for a government-controlled economy that they hope to impose on the national level if Labor gains control of the House of Commons in the elections due within the next two years . <> <> Misconduct Ruling by Judge // Critics scoff at the Militants , most recently in savoring a court ruling that the Liverpool Council majority was in " willful misconduct " last year in causing a crisis by delaying their duty to raise taxes for the budget . Forty-seven Labor councilors were denounced as " political zealots " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and fined $150 , 000 as provided under the public-servants law. // The Militants ' talent for governing was thus questioned , but their knack for aggressive politicking was attested to in a separate incident when a Labor Member of Parliament from the Liverpool region , Robert Kilroy-Silk , announced he was quitting after " three years of misery and vilification , " he charged , by the Militants . The resignation embarrassed Mr. Kinnock just when he was trying to rally Labor moderates in the Militants ' strongholds. // After a decade of Militant growth in the party , Mr. Kinnock obviously senses the left-flank pains or paralysis that extremists could cause in any future Labor government . He has been mocking their city government efforts and driving out the Militant leaders as Labor heretics given to " lunacy , " not idealism. // " Kinnock can expel people , but he can ' t expel ideas , " said Terry Harrison , one of the founding Militants now driven from the party , who insisted the group was a legitimate Marxist wing of the party and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinnock charges . Estimates are that there might be 5 , 000 Militants among the party ' s 275 , 000 members , but they are active and well organized , with their own well-financed newspaper. // " Our crime is that we have organized too well , " Mr. Harrison said , stressing that , whatever the state of their orthodoxy , the Militants have made themselves a powerful force in Liverpool . " Militant made an influence by insisting that the party ' s own principles be given muscle and bone , " he said , referring to Socialist goals. #60 , 000 Jobs Are Lost About 60 , 000 manufacturing jobs have been eliminated in Liverpool over the last seven years , with unemployment at 20 percent on average . Among the young in neighborhoods like Dovecot and Croxteth , it is estimated to be near 90 percent. // Mr. Kinnock ' s crusade against the Militants is greatly appreciated by Sir Trevor Jones , the Liberal Party leader on the City Council , who contends that the city is broke and badly run and that his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next elections . In his view , the Kinnock offensive , as much as it might reassure middle-class voters closer to London , could prove self-defeating because it overlooks the fact that " whether he likes it or not , the Militants are the Labor Party here. " // National party officials insist a more moderate Labor alternative is viable here , but Sir Trevor says leaders of all the major parties fail to realize that unless serious unemployment is urgently dealt with , the appeal of extremism , particularly to the young , will have a growing effect on mainstream politics. // In a certain way , Militants like Mr. Mulhearn agree . " Kinnock can change the party , but he can ' t change the people , " he said , vowing to see Militant ideas prevail in national policy. // But Mr. Kinnock contends that the issue is the reliability of the Labor Party ' s own ideas and whether they will be subverted from within .
