LA BOHEME by Giacomo Puccini <P> The irreverent music lover attends this sassy and unconventional La Boheme in a mood for sedition . That does not mean impatience with the soaring lyrical glories of Puccini 's music-nobody boos a sunset . But Mimi , the consumptive Parisian seamstress , has been a dying duck since the opera 's first performance in 1896 , and her fog-witted lover Rodolfo , the poet , has moped melodiously for the same stretch . A certain amount of dust has gathered . Only the fustiest of traditionalists would grouch at the news that Joseph Papp 's musical irregulars from the New York Shakespeare Festival have decided to give Boheme an airing out . <P> These are the same pranksters who four years ago made a rowdy success of the lovable Gilbert and Sullivan warhorse The Pirates of Penzance . Then as now , Papp was the producer , Wilford Leach the director , William Elliott the music supervisor and conductor , and Pop Singer Linda Ronstadt was boss soprano in charge of provoking doleful predictions that she could not possibly handle an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilled winsomely as Mabel . <P> The new Boheme , sung in a flip , funny new English version by Lyricist David Spencer , is no Pirates-sized smash , but its opening night last week , in Papp 's tiny Anspacher Theater , was a modest , almost bashful , success . This is petit opera , not grand , but there is a clear gain in warmth and intimacy at the level of drama . The singers use body mikes instead of heroic rib cages and Pavarottal diaphragms , but they are young and good-looking , and they have no trouble seeming appropriately broke and love-sopped ( nor in delivering Spencer 's sometimes jarring lines : <P> <P> Marcel , the artist , tells Rodolfo , " I 'm freezing my nuts off " ) . By the time Mimi and Rodolfo have fallen into their first-act clinch , as a mandolin plucks away in the twelve-piece theater band , sentimentalists are dabbing at their eyes . <P> That is the test : if the hankies come out , Boheme is a success . The shocker was that onlookers misted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strawberry-blond Soprano Patti Cohenour . ( Lead duties are divided ; Cohenour sings four of eight weekly performances ; Ronstadt three , and another Mimi , Caroline Peyton , the remaining show . ) The sweet-voiced Cohenour and her surprisingly strong Rodolfo , Country Singer Gary Morris , seemed lyrically in love . The other leads , a fine Marcel ( Howard McGillin ) and a brilliant Musette ( Cass Morgan ) , took fire from them . The night before , Ronstadt and her Rodolfo , David Carroll , had sung at and past each other without making contact , and the rest of the cast was in shock . <P> The fault was Ronstadt 's . Her voice seemed small and uncertain , and she was unable to move from her strong , rock-belter 's low register to her silvery high notes without shifting gears awkwardly in her uncertain middle range , where most of Mimi 's singing is done . It seems doubtful that her deficiencies are readily curable . She must have known early in rehearsal that the experts had been right to say that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might have quit then and sunk a production that depended heavily on her name . That she stayed to take her critical lumps may have been arrogance , or it may have been a rare act of gallantry . - By John Skow
