Freeman 40mama 's cherished possessions , dearest mama . . . her presence would be felt . Dovid , miracle man that he was , came home with a crate of eggs and a sack of onions , then accompanied his wife to the marketplace . The women of the village looked at one another as Dovid put the bundles of food into his handcart , stared at one another in disbelief . What husband did that ? At Reb Levi 's stall they heard Manya arguing that the chickens were good for the goyim but not fit to be eaten by pigs . Reb Levi endured this abuse from Manya every Shabbes , so why should this be any different , but he was wise to her . It was her way of trying to intimidate him by demeaning his poultry so she could buy cheaper . Manya , he already knew . She was famous for bargaining . " I would n't give you off a penny , " he called back . " Did I ask ? I only want pound for pound for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam , go elsewhere . Aggravation from you I do n't need . " " Aggravation I 'm giving you ? If your chickens were as big as your mouth , I would n't be complaining . " " Oy vay , a heart attack I 'll get from her . . . all right already , here , take a capon for the same price . " Manya felt beneath the thick white feathers . This one was pleasingly fat . " So , for this great favor , what do you want ? " " Make it two kopeks and it 's yours . " " One . " Some chutzpah , but Manya would outtalk him . In desperation he finally said , " I 'll give your charity to the shul . " On the way out she saw Chavala and Dovid . No wonder Chavala could n't wait to marry him . He was so tall and handsome , and virile . Thick black hair , deep blue eyes , and those lips that must have tasted like sweet wine . But why was he here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked so out of place . There could be only one reason . Manya 's eyes wandered to Chavala 's middle . It had been after all , six whole months . Well , maybe being thin like Chavala was , she did n't show . Not like her , she was only in her third month and already she looked like six . After their usual amenities they wished one another the happiest of Passovers and that they should all be blessed with good health above all ... still , " A little prosperity would n't hurt , " Manya added .. . At home Chavala 's eyes and nose ran as she grated the horseradish root . then mixed the beet pulp , sugar and winc vinegar . Screwing on theNo Time For Tears 41top of the jar she laughed , it was so strong that if anything could ward off the evil eye it would surely be the horseradish . Then she began to chop the fish mixture in a large wooden bowl , and as she did so her mother came to mind . . . among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in mind only . Not written down . Yes , mama 's gefilte fish was the envy of the village . Sheine made the matzoh balls , while Chavala basted the chickens , and then together the two sisters put themselves to the task of making the sponge cakes . Sheine beat the egg whites and Chavala the yolks . When all the cooking was finally completed , and since Passover had fallen oh Friday , at three in the afternoon Chavala went to the mikvah . At the precise moment of the setting sun the family was seated . At the head of the table papa sat in his armchair , surrounded by eiderdown pillows . To his right sat Dovid , Sheine next to him . The closeness to Dovid made Sheine 's pulse beat fast , this was a place she would rather not be . Sheine still lived with her dreadful secret . . . she was so much in love with Dovid that most of the time she could not even bear to be in his presence , and it was at those times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdrawn . At nights she would lay awake and listen to the sounds of love beyond the hanging blanket , and out of fear that her sobs would be heard she buried her face in the pillow . To be so in love with her sister 's husband brought pain and shame to her heart . If only she could exchange her place at the table with Dvora , who sat next to her . But this was the way they had always been seated , with Moishe across the table near papa . Chavala stood at the other end of the table dressed in mama 's black silk with the white lace collar and the shawl over her head as she began the ritual of lighting the candles . But , despite herself , instead of listening to the inspired message of Shabbes , Sheine 's thoughts were displaced by envy . Mama had left Chavala the small diamond earrings because she had the good fortune of being the eldest . She also wore the pair of wide gold bracelets that had been Dovid 's mother 's . Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chavala looked like a queen tonight . She looked like the peasant she was . She bowed her head , not in reverence , but because the sight of Chavala with Dovid was too much for her . The seder went on for hours , not a passage was deleted , not a song left unsung . Avruni Rabinsky could have told the story of Passover without the aid of a I laggadah . It was a story burned into his mind , so that if he were blind it could still have come from his lips . Uncovering the matzohs andCynthia Freeman 42lifting up the plate for all to see , he recited , " This is the bread of affliction which our forefathers ate in the land of Egypt . All who are hungry come and celebrate the Passover with us . Now we are here , next year may we be in the land of Israel . Now we are slaves , next year may we be free men . " Moishe looked across the table , where Dovid 's eyes met his and in both the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covered with a special fringed napkin and a second cup of wine was filled . It was Raizel 's privilege , being the youngest at the table , to ask the ancient four questions beginning with : " Why is this night different from all other nights ? " Although Avrum answered , Dovid added silently , Because of Chavala , the blessing and joy she has brought to my existence is why tonight is different .. . When the reaffirmation was proudly intoned by Avrum , " Next year in Jerusalem , " again Moishe and Dovid nodded . Chavala , though , prayed that next year they would be in the land of the free and the home of the brave . . . America . The Jews of that great land of opportunity had no need to return to Russia , broken in body and many in spirit from the malaria-infested swamps of Palestine . For the sake of her father and her husband , and apparently now her brother Moishe too , she was thankful , her thoughts could not be read . She and Sheine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and Dvora served small bowls of fruit compote . Avrum looked around the table at his children , especially the little one , and spoke silently to his Rivka . My dearest , you left me with so much , I weep that you can not share this with me . Yet you are not far away . I know your spirit abides and is over us , and all the days of my life it will be so ... On Sunday Chavala prepared a platter of matzoh brei and when the sumptuous breakfast was over she left the kitchen chores to be done by the girls and returned to sewing while Dovid went back to his workbench . The small village hummed with the excitement of market day . Sundayswere always special . The women not only replenished their larders , but the square became a meeting place to exchange bits of gossip while their husbands attended to the affairs of earning a living . The young yeshiva boys sat hunched over their Torah portions as their elders , dressed in their long black coats and wide beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the stalls mothers visited while buying their briskets and beets to make borscht . Outside the children amused themselves with a stick andNo Time For Tears 43a ball . Nursing mothers with their babies at their breasts sat on a bench . The scene of this Sunday 's Passover afternoon was the same as it had been for a century past . It was a good day , a happy day for the Jews in their small village . But for the Christians in the city of Odessa , there was quite a different drama being enacted . As the church bells pealed out , calling the faithful to worship , their religious fervor was forgotten as they sat in their pews . Dressed in his robes , the bearded priest looked out to his flock in a moment of silence , then began : " This is a tragic day . A terrible act has been perpetrated upon one of our beloved children . At dawn this morning an innocent child was found murdered at the very door of this holy place . We are civilized people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven . We preach and teach love , but our words go unheeded . Who in this land could be so vile as to violate this angel ? Who could be so perverse as to want the blood of this precious lamb ? In the name of our Savior , the life of this maiden must be avenged . " Before the priest had finished a hue and cry rang throughout the sanctuary . As one voice they called out , " KILL THE JEWS , KILL THE JEWS . . . DEATH TO THE JEWS ! " The parishioners ran from the church , the women and children told to return home , the men gone to saddle their horses . . . Moishe was returning home flushed with excitement as he felt the kopeks in his pocket . He had sold three pairs of boots today . He would keep only a small part for himself and the rest he would give to Dovid . Going up to the front door , he paused , then looked into the far distance . Coming down over the hills he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students had joined in the crusade . Although the shouting was still not distinct , he knew . He 'd seen this and heard the words before . Quickly he went into the house and stood in front of Chavala ... " Pogrom , pogrom ... " Chavala clutched her heart but told herself she must n't panic . If ever she needed her wits , it was now . She had Moishe come with her to the kitchen to open the trapdoor to the cellar , which was hidden beneath a heavy movable cupboard . After the two had managed to swing it open , she then went to summon her father . Without preamble  --  " They 're starting , papa ... they have come to kill us . " Taking his holy books , he obeyed . When all the children were assembled , she sent them down . Dvora carried the canister of water , Sheine the matzohs , and Raizel the bottle of goat 's milk . They were hack in Egypt . But here there was no MosesCynthia Freeman 44to lead them across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chia , Chavala said , " There , safety is in your hands , light the candles . " Then she paused and handed him the death pellets . Moishe could only look at her , stunned . " Remember Masada , " she told him . " What about you , Chavala ? " Moishe said . " I 'm going to Dovid . With God 's help we 'll join you . " After she pushed back the cupboard with all her strength she started toward the front door but retreated back against the wall as the door crashed forward . And then her courage left her and in its place was terrible , stark fear . These , she knew , would be the last moments of her life . She stayed rooted to the floor , barely breathing . Her fears became even greater at the sounds of furniture being thrown against the wall . The most shattering sound of all was the crashing glass . They must have been in papa 's room and had evidently found nothing , because the footsteps of heavy boots were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings , the gold bracelets Dovid had given her on their wedding day , the small diamond-and-amethyst brooch which had belonged to his grandmother . But the jewelry did n't matter , she only prayed Dovid was hiding and safe . Until now Chavala considered calling on God 's help useless , but in this moment . . . " Please God , do n't let Dovid come home now , keep him safe , although I know I am unworthy , I beg you . " The rest of her pleas remained silent as she heard the clash of her sewing machine hurled against the wall . The bread they ate came from the toil of that machine . Hearing the screams and wailing beyond the confines of where she stood , she knew the wave of horror that had fallen over her people . They were being tortured and beaten , they were being dragged from their hiding places in cellars and garrets and put to death . Smoke rose up from the burning houses and the winds shifted so that she stuck a rag in her mouth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left and in its place came an overwhelming hatred . How long would it be before this monster discovered her , not only her , but her precious family imprisoned beneath where she now stood ? Mama had n't given her life so that the lives of her children should end in a massacre . If it meant dying , she would die . But not until she killed this crazy devil . Her eyes fell on the large butcher knife . Reaching for it , she inched her way along the wall until she stood to one side of her sewing room . She listened as her heart heat like a drum . It seemed too quiet . She peered through the crack of the wooden slats . 1 lis hack was turned awayNo Time For Tears 45from the entrance , and dear God , he was going through her sewing basket . Now he fondled the gold bracelets and put them in his pocket . Taking off her shoes , she walked softly into the room , and plunged the knife between his shoulder blades . As though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been broken from the machine and with all her strength brought it down over his head . The body fell with such a thud that the flimsy floorboards shook . For a long moment he . . . it . . . quivered as the last breath of life was dissipated . Chavala stood trembling . She thought her legs would give way as she steadied herself against the wall . Looking down at the body moment ? Oh God , what had her vengeance brought down on the family ? Why had n't she let him kill her ? That she should even have committed an act so violent . . . but with all her overlapping fears , she brought herself up short . . . she had to deal with them as she had with this monster . . . Quickly she covered the body with rags and the debris he had created , mopped up the bloody floor and shut the door . She went back to the kitchen and sat at the table , holding her face in her hands . Dovid , where was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Dovid was dead , she knew it . Nothing else would have kept him away . Should she go out and try to find her husband ? But.what about the ones huddled together below ? She prayed Moishe would survive . He would be the only one to protect the family if anything happened to Dovid and her . As the confusion in her mind flew back and forth , she suddenly became aware of less and less noise in the village . . . was it possible that the wave of horror had ended ? She was afraid to hope , yet it truly seemed to be abating . She listened . There was no more shouting of KILL THE JEWS . She looked at the cupboard , which covered the trapdoor , wondering why God had spared this house . She would never know the answer , but for the first time since her mother 's death , a rush of tears came down over Chavala 's face . Unsteadily she got up from the kitchen table and walked past the closed door to her sewing room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lay the broken front door . She took a deep breath as she stood framed in the doorway , then without hesitation found herself standing against the wall on the front porch . Her shock was total . Most of the village was in flames . All she heard were the agonizing , mournful cries of the living . I low had the Angel of Death passed over their house ? Why had God singled them out to be saved ? Why ? And then the thought of Dovid rushed back to her , and she managed the strength to run acrossCynthia Freeman 46the road . All that she had feared was well-founded . Dovid lay on the floor in a pool of blood . His hands and ankles were bound with rope . His face had been battered almost beyond recognition . She knelt at his side . Drawing him to her she heard his shallow breathing . He was alive . Cradlinghim close to her as a child , she whispered , " My dearest Dovid , do n't die . Do n't leave me . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his consciousness Dovid 's eyes fluttered . Still , he knew he was dead . Chavala was , too . They were together . But if he was dead why was the pain so great ? Did one suffer in death as in life ? Chavala 's sweet voice soothed him ... " My darling , I 'll be back in a little while and we 'll take you home . Do you hear me , dearest ? " His eyes fluttered yes , and she gently put the pillow beneath his head , covered him with a blanket and put a cup of water to his lips . They were too swollen to take it . Kissing him , she left and ran across the road . When the family came up from out of the darkness and saw Chavala , they clung to her , and as though with wings of an eagle she embraced them all and tried to quiet their fears . She poured mugs of milk when they sat at the table and put out the sponge cake . After they had finished she told Sheine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , then motioned to her brother to follow her . Inside her sewing room she tore away the rags and exposed the ... creature . Moishe stood back in horror , looking at the huge butcher knife now dried with blood . " What happened ? " Chavala explained with as little detail as possible . There was so much to be done . " If he 's found here we know what will happen . He must be buried so deep that the dogs will not be able to sniff him out . Start the digging near the cherry tree while I wrap him up in rags . Then I 'll help you . " When the digging was finished Chavala poured alcohol over the body and the two of them dragged him to the small orchard and watched as he tumbled down the six feet . After the burial was finished they stood back , breathing hard . In the darkness Chavala said , " Come , let 's wash him from our hands . " With the help of everyone , Dovid was brought home and laid.on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry brandy hadNo Time For Tears 47dulled his senses so that he felt very little of that short journey . She sponged his body and spoon-fed him broth and that night she lay on the floor mat next to his . What seemed to Chavala a miracle not to be questioned , the next afternoon Dovid awoke to full consciousness . She would not ask what happened , it was unimportant . Leaving him in Sheine 's care , she and Moishe went to see what they could do to help the bereaved . Except for a few houses all had been burned to the ground . The Chevra Kadisha , the ritual baths , the yeshiva and the shul were all in ashes . The cemetery had been desecrated , with many bodies dug up and scattered . The wounded lay in the roads and alleys . Yankel the milkman and his sons were heaping the dead into his cart to be taken up the hill . It was a devastation beyond all comprehension . Not even the devil could have invented such revenge . Manya 's family had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two youngest babies thrown from the attic to the ground . Rabbi Gottlieb 's beard had been torn from his face . He had been beaten with clubs until he lay beyond redemption . Those few who remained helped to bury the dead , whether theirs or not , as though the deceased belonged to them all , as indeed they did . The land of Canaan , from where they had all come , bound them together , one circle without beginning , without end . Then those same who had survived rent their clothing , sat on the ground and recited the Kaddish , mourning the dead , yet praising God all the same .... Chapter TwoCHAVALA 'S APPREHENSIONS GREW . She expected the locusts to comehunting for the buried , but she had kept her fears from Dovid . Dovid 's health was returning , and thanks to his inherent strength he had sustained the beating . Her Dovid was a lion . This morning she could no longer put off telling him of the great danger that hung over their lives . Sitting on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dovid , I must tell you something , something I never thought myself capable of ... the day of the pogrom ... I killed a elan And she told him every detail , right up to the point where sheCynthia Freeman 48and Moishe had buried him . " We ca n't stay ... I only hope you 're well enough to travel . " He would try to absorb what she 'd told him about the killing later . It was no little thing to take in about your wife ... a woman not like others , no question about that ... " How could I be otherwise with a wife who coddled me like little Chia ? " " I know we must leave . One day he will be discovered , they 'll come back looking for him ... " " All right , darling , but to get to Palestine is no easy matter . " Palestine ? Chavala had n't thought of going to Palestine . Why had she thought that what she so wanted was all that Dovid wanted too ... So her dream that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wish had always been to die in Eretz Yisroel , and if for nothing else she would have to set aside her own hopes ... but after he was gone and she had done her duty , well , then she would feel free to speak out . But she knew that talking against going to Palestine while still in Odessa was pointless ... the devotion to Zionism was complete in Dovid now . She was sure ... hopeful ... that once Dovid found out the reality of that land he would want America as much as she . Dovid was , she honestly believed , being seduced by an impossible dream . He would have to see that ... " Right now there 's no way for us to go  --  " " Yes , there is ... we have the money . " He looked at her . " We have the money ? From what ? " " From my mother 's diamond earrings . " " No , that 's the legacy she left you . It 's my place to provide . I am your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this was playing with their lives . " Listen to me , Dovid . I know that they will be back , and I ca n't eat or sleep for thinking about it . But even if they do n't come back because of him , they will come back . Please , let 's not be here when the pogroms start again . You 've heard what is happening in Kiev , in the Ukraine and in the settlements , you know the violence and burnings that are going on . No , Dovid , we ca n't wait . Next time we might not be so lucky . That you 're alive is a miracle ... " Dovid looked at his wife . Actually he 'd wanted this for a long time , and it was Chavala that was making it possible , arguing for it ... he only hoped he could make it up to her . " Chavala ... I never knew a man could be so lucky ... you , my darling , are no ordinary woman ... " No Time For Tears 49 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeweler in Odessa asked . Chavala stood nervously as the jeweler looked through his loupe examining the small diamond earrings , wondering how these tiny gems had come to a peasant . Small they were , but perfect and blue-white . " So how much do you want ? " How much ? Quickly Chavala tried to figure what it would take them to get to Palestine . " Tell me what they 're worth to you , if the price is right , I 'll take it , if not , I 'll go elsewhere . " He inspected them once again . " Ten rubles . " " Thank you , that 's very kind , but give me back my earrings  --  " " Fifteen . I should have offered only twelve , but ... for a pret-ty  --   --  " I should n't take less than fifty , but give me forty and they 're yours . " He laughed , " You 're crazy ... I can buy them in the marketplace or " Thank you , but these are very valuable . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew nothing of the kind . " My final offer is twenty-five . " " Thirty . " Fire was in her eyes , terror in her heart . The man laughed , shook his head . Counting out the money he said , " You should be a diamond merchant . To bargain , you know how very well . " With the rubles securely in her hand , she said , " And you know how to cheat . " Turning on her heels she walked with high dignity out the door , slamming it behind her . As she hurried along the street the echo of the gonif 's words rang in her ears . " You should be a diamond merchant ... " A possibility ? Well , a small pair of diamond earrings was buying their freedom . Diamonds meant money and money meant freedom , the power to be free , at least to challenge the world . The words would live with Chavala ... " You should be a diamond merchant ... " If they had lived to escape the tyranny and near-death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... When she returned home it was with the steamship tickets they needed for steerage . But her greatest pleasure was handing Dovid one gold napoleon that she was able to convert from the rubles she still had left even after the tickets had been purchased . Chavala ( ( x ) k sonic heart that at least geographically they were in theCynthia Freeman 50right place . Odessa was within walking distance and on the Black Sea . Since Jews had never been able to own property , that was a problem they did n't have  --  there was nothing to dispose of . As always , Jews left with only what they could carry . So on the twenty-second of May in the year 1906 , the RabinskyLandaufamily closed the door behind them . There was nothing to look back on in fond memory , except , perhaps for that small sanctuary marked by a blanket , Chavala and Dovid 's universe . Moishe wheeled Dovid 's handcart filled with their bedding , clothing , cooking utensils and little Chia 's crib . Raizel carried one basket of food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custodian of her own belongings , which she had meticulously packed in a paper carton . Dovid and Chavala walked side-by-side , she with the baby in her arms , Dovid holding the rope for the goat to follow . Avrum clutched his holy books to his chest . Soon the small assembly was lost from sight , as Yankel the milkman wiped the tears from his eyes and blew his nose on the rag he had taken from his pocket . He stood in the middle of the road long after they disappeared , wishing their journey could have been his own . WHEN they reached the port in Odessa they were far from being alone . Theirs was hardly an isolated departure ... from the small towns and hamlets of the Ukraine and the Russian-controlled parts of Poland hundreds of young men and women were packing their meager belongings , and with tears of good-bye to their parents , leaving for , they hoped , something better . Some merely ran away from home when fathers accused their sons of heresy . Zionism was a forbidden doctrine among many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with family denunciation ... God will send the Messiah was the watchword that rang through the religious of the shtetl , wait , wait . But the youth of that day was the same as that of any other ... it could no longer hold to the misguided rabbis and the devotions of their fathers . A new time was at hand , and the young were moving with the times . If the Messiah had not redeemed them in two thousand years , then they would redeem themselves . Through Zionism . On rusting , battered , listing freighters they left Odessa . Sonic would embark at Trieste , or Constantinople , or Port Said , where they would change to slow cargo vessels to the promised land . The Rabinsky-landau clan 's ancient freighter was N ) und for Jaffa . No Time For Tears 51CHAVALA and the children found space belowdecks , where they preparedtheir bedding on the floor while Dovid went to make arrangements for the goat . Avrum went up on deck , took out his tallis and wrapped himself in it , then swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hear me , jaeoh . Israel , whom I have called . I am the one . The beginning and the end . My own hand founded the earth and spread out the skies . Thus saith the Eternal One . Who created the heavens and stretched them out . Who made the earth and all that grows in it , who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk on it . The food supplies were rationed by Chavala . The baby had colic ... the goat 's milk had soured . Dvora had dysentery . Raizel seemed to manage the discomforts without complaint , and Sheine became acquainted with a chevraman from Galicia whom Dovid distrusted almost as much as the Russian moujiks . So far as he was concerned , the Galicianerswere selfish Boni/s . Knowing how difficult things were for Chavala , Dovid was reluctant to mention the change in Sheine , so he assumed a fatherly role on his own ... " Sheine , I want you to stay away from this chevraman . I do n't like the liberty I saw him take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around you  --  " " You 're not my father . I do n't have to listen to you . " There was anger in her eyes , when of course it was love she wanted to show . She had allowed the Galicianer to hold her for Dovid to see , to let him know how desirable she could be to a man . Chavala was n't the only one . If she 'd had the jewels he 'd given his wife and the black silk dress with the white lace collar , well , she too could look like a queen " Sheine , you 've changed so I hardly recognize you , " he said , shaking his head . Cynthia Freeman 52 " Oh ? You noticed I changed ? Did you , Dovid ... well , good . I 'm a woman , I 'm thirteen and  --  " " I know you 're a woman , Sheine . But at the risk of sounding like a boring pedant , I 'd like to point out that being a woman does n't make a person a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family already . I want to be a woman . " Spoken like a true thirteen-year-old , he thought . She turned and ran until she reached the place that led her to their dark hold below , where she lay down and cried herself into exhaustion . When they came into the Mediterranean people ventured on deck . There was music from a concertina , a violin , a tambourine , and the dancing lasted until dawn . Still , this night seemed impossible for Dovid . His worry about the future seemed to eat him up , and the festivities above only grated on his nerves . As they neared Palestine the sea became calm and the air almost stifling . Although he had never mentioned it , in spite of the tightly bound cloth Chavala had made for him his ribs were far from healed and tonight they ached badly . He watched his wife sitting with the other women as she held little Chia , and wondered why still she had n't conceived . A dark thought passed through his mind ... his beloved Rivka seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life , and when he thought of her and her awful death he almost hoped he and Chavala would be childless . After all , there were the girls to raise , and they were like his own . Little Chia would think of him as a tateh , and  --  his thoughts were interruptedas a young man sat down next to him , took out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead . The shock of dark hair receded , although Dovid would have guessed them to be the same age . " In a few days we 'll be in Eretz Yisroel . What do you think of that ? " the stranger asked . " What do I think ? I think it 's a miracle  --  " " Ah ... the miracle has just begun . Where are you from ? " The stranger was short , stocky . " Near Odessa . And you ? " " Plonsk . What do you do for a living ? " " Make boots . You ? " The stocky man laughed . " I 'm a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dovid looked carefully at this man . " What 's your name ? " " David Gruen . " " Mine is Dovid Landau . " No Time For Tears 53The two men shook hands , and Dovid , taken by the man , asked him about himself . David Grien 's mother had died when he was very young , and his father and he proceeded thereafter to have huge disagreements about their beliefs . In the end David defied his father and announced without preamble his departure to Palestine . That was as far as David wanted to go on about the saga of his life . It was as though the rest of his past were nonexistent , no longer of any consequence . " The past is prologue , as Shakespeare said , I come into this old , new world with very little , yet so much . I bring to Palestine young and healthy arms . The love of work , an eagerness for freedom to live in the land of our forefathers , and a willingness to be frugal . If we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There we will create a model society , based on economic abundance . But above all , political equality . " He went on and on , like a missionary ... with a passion that seemed to Dovid to be seared into his soul . One day , he said , the Jews of the world would rise up , not with arms , not with violence , but with one universal voice ... " Let my people go , let them live and multiply in the land of their heritage . The land that was their portion when King David brought the Ark to Jerusalem ... " No question , the man was a spellbinder , and totally convinced . . . and convincing ... Now the two sat silently and looked at the midnight sky , sat with thoughts of the future ... " Well , " Dovid said to the round-faced young man . " I have to go now and join my wife , but I wish you well . I hope we meet again . " " I hope so too , chevraman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petach Tikvah , ask for David Ben-Gurion , not David Grien . I left that name behind in the ghetto of Plonsk . Now ... shalom ... " Palestine1906Chapter ThreeTHE LEAKING VESSEL now stood anchored beyond Jaffa . It was early morning , a white mist obscured the distance beyond , but everyone stood at the rail . They had come home at last . As the mist lifted , the shoreline of Jaffa could be seen . Beauty , promise lay beyond as the pink-and-blue sky seemed to embrace the green waters of the Mediterranean . Suddenly there was a feeling beyond expression . It was as though all their lives had merged into this moment . . . moment of deliverance . Avrum touched the fringes of his talks with his lips , then swung himself into the prayer shawl . For him it was as though God 's arms encompassed him . There was joyful singing . Strangers embraced , minyans gathered , people bound one another with leather straps around the right arm . On their forehead they placed the minute black leather box that contained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was written . . . " Let there be light . . . " And now there was . Chavala held onto Dovid as they looked toward what for him was Eden , a trip for her . She looked beyond the horizon  --  her Eden was America  --  she would wait . Moishe could not speak , but he could see it all in his mind . . . the good rich earth where everything grew  --  oranges , melons , sweet and deliciousto the taste like honey , and almonds and grapes . There would be wheat , barley , corn . They would never go hungry again . Sheinc stood watching Chavala and Dovid , then looked directly at Motel , the boy from Galicia . Ile returned the look . " Will I see you again ? " Cynthia Freeman 58Sheine shrugged . She had only used the chalutz to make Dovid more aware of her . " Who knows ? Perhaps ... " Their conversation came abruptly to an end , as the whole assembly called out , " Look , they 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats could be seen . The chalutzim were rowing fast with deliberate strokes to try and beat the Arabs , who would steal the Jews ' possessions and angrily demand , " Baksheesh , haksheesh ... " They would loot anything they could lay their hands on . Children were running to the rail as the Turkish officers came aboard and demanded papers . Dovid uneasily offered his and a Turk grabbed them out of his hand . The Russian-speaking Turks demanded to know why they were there , and the reply was that they had come as religious pilgrims to pray at the Wailing Wall . Since no Jew was permitted by law to immigrate into Palestine , Dovid answered each question with caution as the rest of the family stood there , frightened . How long would they be staying ? " Just three weeks , " Dovid said , hoping that within three weeks the Turks would be bribed and his family would disappear into the landscape as hundreds of other refugees had done before them . When the Turks ' questions seemed satisfied , the red cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his papers were confiscated . Dear God , thought Chavala , what would they do ? As the red-sashed official moved on , Chavala asked , " What will happen to us without our papers ? " Passengers ran helter-skelter , some diving into the water , some throwing their things overboard and jumping in after them , and Dovid said , " We do n't have time to think about that , at least we have the red tags . " Now the rowboat bobbed up and down at the side of the ship , and the big chalutz bellowed out , ' Jump . " Although no one could swim it was either drown or be molested , maybe even killed by the Arabs , who were climbing a rope to the deck . Dovid told Chavala to tear her petticoat into strips , and without thoughts of modesty she slipped out of it . The whole family , in fact , was now involved . Soon the strips were knotted and attached to Chia 's basket , then lowered until the chalutz retrieved the basket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump . Her heart in her throat , she plunged down into the sea . When she bobbed up to the surface one of the three chalutzim was in the water helping ; her into the small boats . She shivered , dripping wet , then oneNo Time For Tears 59after another followed until they were all huddled together in the tiny vessel . " Shalom . " The huge chalutz smiled his greetings . " Welcome to Eretz Yisroel . " " Shalom . Thank God you came out to more than welcome us , " Dovid said . " What will happen to our things and papers ? " asked Chavala . " Do n't worry , with money you 'll have your things back . " " But we do n't have much  --  " " Who has ? " the chalutz said , " but the Zion Agency will take care of it , do n't worry . One thing we can depend on as Jews is charity from our own . How else have we survived all these years ? " When Avrum saw the sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the boat , waded to shore and as he reached the beach , bent down and kissed the ground , his black coat dripping , making rivulets in the sand . " This house , " he said , " is but a spark , a remnant saved by a miracle from that great fire . Kept by our fathers always upon their altars . You carried us safely to the shore ... " Like a small armada , other boats were tying up at the wharf , and as people were being helped out by the chalutzim ashore there was a torrent of weeping and embraces with their own chaverim , their fellow Jews . Chavala 's tears flowed too , listening to the delighted voices and seeing the faces . They had come as strangers , they had arrived together , sharing , at least for now , a common destiny . Chavala felt most of all the presence of her own as they clustered together . For this moment , at least , she felt at one with Dovid and all the others about the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this precious piece of time she had come to terms with her desires ... America would be there when that time came , but this supreme moment belonged to those she loved ... those she would gladly have died for . Dovid noted one of the members of the Zionist office talking to a Turkish official , and could well imagine what it was about ... no Turkish official was above corruption . For a price almost anything could be overlooked , forgotten . Corruption was at the very core of the dying Ottoman Empire . The Yishuv member was bartering for the possessions of the Jews , to have their papers and belongings returned . The money was extorted , then word spread among the newest arrivals that they were to wait and that their belongings and papers would be returned to them soon . Cynthia Freeman 60As they waited , Avrum Rabinsky said angrily , " Even here , in our own Eretz Yisroel , we 're subject to blackmail ? It 's not enough , it seems , that we paid in Russia for the right to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " The point is , we do n't have a right to be here . Not according to the Turks , anyway . And according to the world we should n't exist at all . It 's a miracle when you come to think of it , but take heart , friend , they 'll never be able to kill us no matter how hard they try . We 're still here on these shores even after all the Crusaders have been ground to dust , and we 'll be here when we see the Turks in hell . " Right or wrong , the words seemed to make things a little easier to take as Avrum waited with his family in the broiling noonday sun . After what seemed an age they were , miracle of miracles . . . plus a little crossing of Turkish palms . . . once again in possession of their papers and other belongings , even Chavala 's goat . Picking up their bundles they started to make their way through the congested narrow alleys of Jaffa . The filth in the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Avrum had envisioned , he had lived his life with a dream of dignity , thinking one day he would sit under his own fig tree . Jaffa seemed worse than any shtetl in Russia , but he told himself that this , after all , was an Arab city and for thousands of years Arabs had lived in a backwash of ignorance . Things would be different when he left here and finally reached his resting place  --  Jerusalem . Whatever disappointment Dovid might have held could n't be read on his face . Still , Chavala knew that this was not the land of freedom , or milk and honey , of beauty and plenty that the Bilus with their messages of hope and promise spouted in the basements and attics and back rooms of Kiev , the Ukraine , and Odessa . Dovid must be affected by the contrast , Chavala thought . As for her , she had not come to Eretz Yisroel with any illusion , any desire to reclaim the land . Her dream was America , and so not expecting anything , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived with a fantasy , the effect on him must be devastating . . . she could , she felt , read his thoughts . They had come unprepared for this . Where were the green hills , the wild flowers . . . where indeed were the roses of Sharon . . . the trees , the pastures where David 's sheep had once grazed ? Where , in fact was a shade tree where any man could sit in peace ? At least she and the rest of her family were young , life could change . Coming to Eretz Yisroel was not like a marriage that hound a man and a woman together forever , it was only a stopping-off ulaee for her , but Naha had come to end his clays with dreams of inheritingNo Time For Tears 61the earth . After all , he was the meek , no question of that . But the land he had hoped for had been desecrated by these heathens . There was no fertile land to walk on , only sand and more sand that went on further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the place Dovid had promised and papa had hoped for . It was a network of swarming humanity that existed in the narrow alleys . Garbage had to be stepped over . Dead fish lay heaped against the wall . Naked Arab children stood about with vacant faces , hollow eyes and bulging bellies . Children not as old as Dvora were already professional beggars and thieves . The women were dressed in torn rags , and their children sat in the doorways of their hovels . Eretz Yisroel was a small cluster of houses built of mud and pitted sandstone perched on uneven low mounds of sand . This place where they stood was supposed to be one of the oldest inhabited places on earth . Well . . . nothing had changed in two thousand years . Chavala looked at her father , his eyes filled with tears . Silently he asked what had they done , what had they done to desecrate God 's holy earth ? His lips barely moving , he asked if they had done the same to Jerusalem , his beloved city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , papa . Remember , this is an Arab city . Jerusalem will be as you hoped . " " Then please , please let 's go on to Jerusalem . " " We must let Dovid make the plans . Come now , papa . " It was n't until the reached the Jewish section of Jaffa that Avrum recovered some of his hope . The young children had not viewed the scene so unhappily . In fact they were enormously excited . Wide-eyed , they walked along the rows of stalls filled with bolts of vibrant colored Oriental silks and cottons , with beads and bangles  --  this was the one that Sheine especially loved . She tried on the harem rings , the bracelets , and she fastened in her lobes a pair of earrings that looked like filigreed lace and were the color of gold . The sandal shop , where Sheine was sure that harem girls shopped , intriguedher . . . she would have given her young life for a pair . Dvora 's tastes inclined to the less dramatic . Imagine cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy the whole excursion . The children broke out in laughter when Moishe tried on a tropical helmet brought by Christian pilgrims , then a red fez with a black tassel . I le wrapped an Arab scarf around his neck , a colorful sash around his middle and stuck a jeweled dagger inside the sash . Trying not to laugh , he asked , " Could I be taken for a Turk ? " Cynthia Freeman 62 " Not likely , " Sheine said , " with your red hair . " Standing outside the stall Avrum said , " That 's enough , children ... I 've seen enough . We 're leaving this Gomorrah . " Sheine looked at the bracelets , at the sandals she would have loved , but to ask would have been futile . They had so little money . But one day , she promised herself , one day she would be back . Dovid led them beyond the marketplace , and in spite of Avrum 's pleadings to go on to Jerusalem , he said they would stay overnight in Jaffa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The hotel of Isaac Hirsch was like a true Jewish home . Odors of fresh baked bread wafted through the air from the kitchen of Frieda Hirsch . Wiping her hands on her white apron , she greeted her guests as though they were long-lost cousins from Minsk . " Shalom , you are welcome in my home . We are like one big family . Do n't hesitate to ask for anything you need . Now , Isaac will show you where the sleeping quarters are . Go rest before supper , " she said as she stroked little Chia under the chin . " Such a little beauty . For her I just may have a hard cookie . " When the family was settled and Avrum finally resigned , Dovid went to the Zionist Settlement Office and waited , as the others did . Suddenly he again saw the short , stocky man with the halo of brown hair  --  " Shalom , Ben-Gurion . " , " Shalom , Dovid Landau , how did things go ? " " In the beginning a little hectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But after today I think we 're ready for anything . " Ben-Gurion laughed , then , " Where are you off to ? " " Jerusalem . I 've come to ask if we can get some transportation . " " Transportation ? If you can get two donkeys you 'll be lucky . " " So I 'll settle for that . We have a big family and a long way to go . " " We all have a long way to go , my friend , but we 'll make it . I 'm goingto suggest that from now on you should speak Hebrew . When we becomea country we must have a language . " Dovid shook his head . " Maybe you 'll be able to speak Hebrew , but you do n't have a father-in-law like mine . To speak in the tongue of the Torah would be to demean God 's word . I 'm afraid in my house Yiddish will be spoken . " " Then you will have to assert yourself as the head of the family . Ben-Yehudah almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his wife for three weeks because of her resistance . How long can a woman he ignored ? She gave in . I wonder if lie 's so happy now . I understand women can talk a lot . " No Time For Tears 63The two laughed . " Where are you staying in Jaffa ? " Dovid asked . " In this hell hole I would n't spend the night . Plonsk was beautiful compared to this place . As soon as I can get my papers I 'm walking to Petach Tikvah . " " You mean today ? " " Today . " " Well , mazel tov . Till we meet again . " THE road to Jerusalem was an obstacle course . . . Arab marauders ambushed travelers on the way to the Holy City , possessions were stolen and lives were at extreme risk . The road was narrow , and large boulders had to be cleared before one could go on . It was n't until they had gone beyond the gorge at Bab el Wad that they allowed themselves to feel even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled , resting at the settlements . Now , within miles of the Holy City , Sheine dropped to the ground in exhaustion . " I ca n't go on . " She hated this place and even , for the moment at least , Dovid for wanting to come here . He had drawn beautiful word pictures of Eretz Yisroel . Well , what they 'd seen so far was dirt , sand and mosquitoes that had bitten her so that painful welts were on her arms and legs . Why had n't they gone to America , like Chavala wanted , instead of this hell on earth ? Sheine had momentarily forgotten the pogrom they 'd fled from . She looked at Chavala who had ridden most of the way on the back of a donkey because she was carrying the baby , little Chia . How charitable of her to let them ride from time to time . Papa was an old man , so she did n't begrudge him riding the beast , but Chavala ! What made her better than the rest of them ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she act as though she 'd given birth to it . Her mean thoughts were interrupted when Dovid said , " Why did n't you tell us before , your feet are bleeding  --  " " Because you were all so anxious to get to Jerusalem by tonight . " " Yes , and the reason is we have no safe place to stay between here and Jerusalem . " Sheine shot hack , " What would have happened if we 'd have stayed another day in Jaffa ? At least there was a little excitement . If we 'd stayed another day do you suppose the heavens would have stood still ? I hate this place , I wish I 'd never come . " Avrum Rabinsky kx ) ked at his daughter for a long painful nunncnt . Cynthia Freeman 64 " I fear for you , Sheine . I think there 's a dybbuk inside you , how could six children have been born of your sainted mother and have one such as you ? " Sheine felt the guilt intended for her . She loved her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand her , did n't know that what haunted and taunted her by day , would n't let her sleep at night . Dovid ... If only she could stamp out her love , her obsession with him . All it caused her was pain . Standing up now , she said , " I 'm sorry , papa , I 'm very tired , please forgive me ... " Dovid picked Sheine up in his arms , " Come , I 'll carry you . " " I do n't need any favors . " Ignoring her , he lifted her up , and as they once again began the journey toward the Holy City she allowed herself to relax in his arms . He felt so good , so strong . It was hard to remember he was Chavala 's husband , especially when she did n't want to . . . clinging to him , she fantasized what it would be like if he were her husband , how it would be to lie next to him in the night , wrapped up in his arms , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman did a man . She closed her eyes and let the fantasy take over . At least he was hers for this moment . WHEN they approached the top hills just before going down into the Holy City the family stood in hushed silence . Clustered together , they had their first view of Jerusalem . . . Above the ancient wall could be seen the golden dome of the Moslem shrine , beyond the courtyard into the distancelay the Mount of Olives and high above sat Mount Scopus , where the faithful were being called to worship , the church bells tolling in the hush of twilight . Chavala looked out to the white limestone of the Judean hills . How many millions of lives had been ground into that dust , she wondered .. . At last they reached the Damascus gates leading to the Old City and slipped through . When Avrum Rabinsky saw the Wailing Wall he actually trembled , sure his heart had stopped beating . The dream had been dreamt for so long he could n't believe that such a miracle could have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his hand over his heart , and when he finally stood before it , he fell on hended knees and kissed the earth . It made no difference to him how neglected these holy stones had become . , . he was here . Getting up , he kissed the stone and with shakingNo Time For Tears 65fingers let his hands wander over its rough surface , repeating the prayer , " Hear , oh Israel : The Lord is our God , the Lord is one . Praised be His name whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever . " And then he intoned , " Cause us , oh Lord our God , to lie down each night in peace , and to awaken each morning to renewed life and strength . Spread over us the tabernacle of Thy peace . Help us to order our lives by Thy counsel , and lead us in the paths of righteousness . Be Thou a shield about us , protecting us from hate and war , from pestilence and sorrow . Curb Thou also within us the inclination to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . Guard our going out and coming in unto life , and peace from this time forth and forevermore . " He thanked the One Above for allowing him to come to this dwelling place , for letting him be a part of those who had gone before him , of the two thousand years that had brought him to this moment . Seeing her father embrace the ancient stones , his fingers exploring the tufts of moss that grew between the cracks , Chavala knew that he at least had come home at last , and she was grateful that her own selfcentereddesires had not denied him this . Those nights as they lay on deck , her secret thoughts had been full of discontent . She remembered looking up to the midnight-blue sky and berating herself for not insisting they go to America . No one had known the demons she 'd fought inside herself . At times her anger was almost impossible to hide . . . her feeling that she should have spoken out in her unhappiness . . . She dared ask , silently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an old man ; he would have lived out his days in the village of his birth if the Russians had n't turned them out . She tried to convince herself that in America , if their stomachs were full , their feet shod , a roof over their heads and money in their pockets , then his dream of dying in the homeland would surely fade . . . But standing here now , watching her old father , Chavala knew in her heart such thoughts were a lie , a self-deception so that she might have her way . But one owed others , she reminded herself . There were debts to be paid . Nobody was born unto himself . Obligations were the kernel of love , and for the first time Chavala did feel at peace with the acceptance of knowing that this was right . Her father 's needs and desires were greater than hers , and she embraced her father as a mother would a child . Whispering , she said , " Come , papa , we must get settled . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing that had been provided for them was a stone hovel twenty-four steps above the street . It sat nestled in a dark , damp alley surrounded by other hovels that looked a thousand years old . Cynthia Freeman 66That night they ate in a dismal kitchen . In the other three rooms there were makeshift beds where the family finally lay down . The next day Chavala , Dovid and the children went to explore this new world . The poverty seemed even more stark than in the little village south of Odessa . It also seemed no better than the streets of Jaffa , and the noise was deafening as they passed the crowded stalls . . . stop it , Chavala chastised herself . Remember why you are here . . . remember what you buried near that blooming tree in Odessa , and remember the fears that forced you and your family to run away . Be grateful . . . be humble , Chavala . Still , in spite of herself , the battle went on in her mind . The poverty was bad anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to living conditions that were barely human . It was a way of life that was accepted and expected . They lived and died on the bounty sent from the Diaspora . Neither Chavala nor any of her family had ever seen begging in the streets by Jews . It was shameful . Children holding out emaciated dirty hands went unnoticed as pious old men hurried on to worship . There was a sickly pallor about them . . . from one generation to the next they had lived in the hovels and dark alleys huddled together . It seemed nature had accommodated their size so that they could fit into their cramped quarters . The men were small compared to both Dovid and Moishe , who was only fifteen . They were round-shouldered from bending over their books and scrolls . The Rabinskys might have been terribly poor in Russia , but it did n't seem so stark , so depressing . Meager as the living was , the Jews tried . Yes , there was charity . . . in every home nailed to the wall was the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could n't make a living were helped , the poor gave to the poor and the poorer gave to those even less fortunate . In her small village there was a feeling of community . . . in spring they picnicked in the meadow , by the cherry tree . It seemed at times , when they were left alone to live in peace , that life had been quite sweet . Maybe it was the smells of mama 's deliciouscooking , but for the little they had , it still did not seem like this . She guessed it was that people missed the things they knew as children . Whatever . . . there was a quality in their lives she did n't feel here , here in this most holy and sacred of places . It especially galled her that the food brought to their table was provided by the alms of charity , and she made a pact with herself that her family would not live their lives without dignity , and dignity was earned from the toil of their hands and the brains in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest day 's work . She would give them a senseNo Time For Tears 67of purpose . If she had an ounce of strength they would not be put in the ranks of the despised and forgotten . . . her family would not live in filth , be clothed in rags . Not hers .. . Chavala counted out a few coins and gave them to Moishe to buy soap , a broom and three scrub brushes . When he returned she recruited the girls . Each was given a lecture on cleanliness . There was a good deal of religion talked about here , but if anything was next to godliness , it was cleanliness . They scrubbed the floors , religiously , and the walls and ceilingsuntil they were spotless . Chavala herself washed everything in sight until her hands were raw . Dovid stretched a rope on the flat-topped roof , then helped Chavala carry up the load . When she looked at the bedding flapping gently in the breeze she forgot her own fatigue and her aching arms . . . it was a good day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her own soap . No such satisfaction for Sheine . Chavala , she thought , had become obsessed with cleaning ; now she insisted that the front stoop be scrubbed and the stairs washed down . " There 's a limit to how hard a person can work , we 're not mules  --  " " Maybe not ! " Chavala snapped back at her , " but we 're not pigs either . This place has n't been cleaned in a hundred years , and if you think I 'm going to allow my family to live like the others you 're mistaken  --  " " What makes you think we 're any different than the others , as you call them , no matter how much you scrub , this place will still be the ghetto  --  " " But at least it 'll be clean . " " A lot of good that will do us , " Sheine said , and ran from the room and down the stone stairs , where she almost collided with Dovid . Breathingquickly , she looked at him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to work , only women . Papa went to the synagogue and the Wailing Wall every day . And Dovid ? What did he do with his time ? Oh , she knew , she 'd asked Moishe and he 'd told her that Dovid spent his time in the cafe at the old slave market , debating and arguing about very important matters with the Lovers of Zion , like how best to correct those ignorant Jews back in the old country . " Where were you going in such a hurry ? " Dovid asked . " Out . " She glared at him . " I know , but where ? " " Where I please  --  " " But why so angry ? " " Ask your wife . She 's a tyrant , she 'd like to make slaves of its andCynthia Freeman 68I 'm sick of it . That 's all she wants us to do , is scrub . For what ? Look at my hands . " He sighed as he saw Sheine trying to hold back the angry tears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better than what ? There 's filth all around us . I hate it here  --  " " This wo n't be forever , Sheine . " " I know , Dovid , as soon as the Messiah comes we wo n't need the Lovers of Zion . " " Please , Sheine , do n't be so bitter , and try not to be angry with Chavala . She 's trying to make a home for us . Now come upstairs with me . Chavala . . . always Chavala . Chavala the queen . Chavala the teacher ... " No , thank you , I 'll be back later . " " But it 's almost time for supper and papa will be  --  " " What are you afraid of , Dovid ? That if I leave this holy place and go beyond the Jaffa gate I might be taken by the Arabs and become a bad woman ? Oh , do n't worry about me . Go see your immaculate wife . " Dovid waited until she disappeared down the narrow cobblestone alley , then stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt was properly placed on his shoulders . Those evenings they 'd sat in the dimly lit kitchen and he 'd talked about the glories they 'd find in Eretz Yisroel . True , things were n't as he 'd hoped , but his own devotion , determinationstill held . Yes . . . if he 'd known the realities he would have prepared them in a different way . If he had n't been so naive he would have understood . . . made them understand . . . that just coming here was only the beginning , not the fulfillment . He 'd been so caught up in the notion of building a new life for all Jews he 'd deluded himself . The truth was , he 'd been ignorant , and his fears now were as great as Sheine 's . For over a week he 'd wandered the streets , become convinced he would never find what he was looking for in Jerusalem . Now he knew that Eretz Yisroel meant Jerusalem only for Avrum , and that to wrench Chavala away would be an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living here ? Slowly he walked up the stairs to where Chavala waited . AVRUM returned home after his day spent in prayer , washed himself so that he could come to God 's table with clean hands . As Chavala brought the food to the table , Avrum looked around and saw that Sheine was not there . He frowned and was about to ask where she was when Sheine came into the room , kissed him on the cheek , then sat down next to Moishe . No Time For Tears 69There was a long , awkward silence as Avrum looked at his daughter . " Where have you been , Sheine ? " " I sent her to the marketplace to buy  --  " But before Chavala could finish , Sheine interrupted : " I can speak for myself . " How dare Chavala treat her as though she were a stupid child ! She did n't need Chavala 's protection . " I wanted to see the city outside the walls , is there anything wrong with that , papa ? " She spoke with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her anger at Chavala that had spoken , not her ... Avrum looked at Sheine . No . . . she was not like the others . There was a defiance , an arrogance . A child did not speak to a father that way ... " Yes , Sheine , there is something wrong with that . A girl does not go out alone . I forbid it , do you hear me ? " " I hear you , papa , but why should you object ? Jerusalem is also outside the walls  --  " " For my daughters Jerusalem does not extend beyond the Damascus gates . From now on you will not go further than the old city . " Sheine sat with her head bowed , biting her lower lip . This humiliationwas too much . . . in front of the others ... Papa had never treated his children with such anger , it was Chavala who was at fault . . . Chavala whom she blamed . She waited to settle herself a little , then excused herself and went to her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out bitter tears . No one , she was convinced , really loved her . She was alone , she always would be .. . When she heard the door open , she wiped her eyes quickly and lay with her face to the wall . " Sheine , " she heard Chavala say , " may I please speak to you ? " Sheine did n't move . " Sheine , please . . . forgive me . I know it was me you wanted to run away from . I was too hard on you . " Slowly Sheine turned toward Chavala , her eyes cold as steel . " How kind of you , but why the sudden concern for me ? Are you feeling guilty for what papa said to me ? That should have made you very happy  --  " " Oh , Sheine , please , let 's not fight . Our lives are difficult enough . All we have is each other . I love you , Sheine . . . you 're my sister . . . I just hope you can love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheine by the shoulders and hugged her close . And somehow in that moment the anger vanished and the two sisters cried in one another 's arms ... Chavala because she hoped so intenselyCynthia Freeman 70that the two would become closer . Sheine 's tears , though , were because she knew that she would always be jealous of Dovid 's love for Chavala , and not her . She wished she could feel differently , but she could n't . Maybe there really was a dybbuk in her . God help her .. . Chapter FourA VRUM HAD BEEN so preoccupied with God that he had failed to notice the great changes in his children . Moishe and Dovid gradually left the tradition of putting on the phylacteries and were absent from the morning prayers . He would have thought that they would have clung to their faith after getting to this holy place , but he came to the realization that Eretz Yisroel for them was not , as for him , a place to drench their souls . He felt in some way he had failed . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faith , and painful as it was to face , in the freedom of their newfound hope he trembled that they were becoming nonbelievers . His heart nearly broke when he admonished Moishe for deceiving him , when he found out he was not attending the yeshiva .. . " Papa , I beg you to understand , " Moishe said . " I love God as much as I ever did , but papa , you must understand that if a man is born free he must pursue his religion according to his times and needs . I will observe , but not in your way . I ca n't go to the yeshiva , because that means to live on charity , and that is something I ca n't live with . I think , papa , the time has come for me to be a man and contribute a man 's share to his family . I 've taken a job in Mea Shearim cutting stones  --  " Avrum clenched his hand out of fear that he would hit his son . But more than his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend on his child . Where , he asked himself , have I failed as a father ? And how had he failed by not being able to reach Dovid ? Dovid wanting to use the sacred words of the Torah was something that Avrum could not tolerate . Dovid 's words rang in his ear : " If we are to be a nation we must speak a common language . Today Eretz Yisroel is like the Tower of Babel , a hundred tongues are spoken here ... " " If God had intended for our sacred words to be spoke- to oneNo Time For Tears 71another it would have been written in the holy text . I forbid it , do you hear me , Dovid , I forbid it . " And saying it , Avrum thought how much he too had changed since coming to Eretz Yisroel . . . he would never have imagined that he could feel such anger against his children , or Dovid ... he had always been , after all , a rather meek man , but his children were demanding things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come to Eretz Yisroel to change the word of God . . . he 'd come here to do God 's will , to live and be buried in the sacred earth . Chavala knew that nothing Dovid could say could convince her father . True . . . they spoke a bastard language , the outgrowth of living in the ghetto , an extraction of German mingled with Russian , a jargon that made it near-impossible to communicate . But Avrum would not give in . Dovid tried again . Hebrew , he said , was the language of their forefatherstwo thousand years ago , and it should have been like honey in his mouth , but Avrum shook his head and turned more than ever to his dedication to God through prayers . . . including more for Dovid 's and his children 's salvation . Avrum Rabinsky 's had become a divided house .. . Chavala lay alongside Dovid and said , " Do n't be angry at papa , Dovid . Remember , he 's an old man who has only one reason for living  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't challenge him , Chavala , I try to explain . All right , I 'll try . Still , we have to try to fulfill ourselves too . We 're entitled to our dreams  --  " " I know , Dovid , dreams are fine , as I said so long ago , but we must n't have our dreams at the expense of other people . " She laughed mildly . " I 'll tell you what my grand dream is right now . . . to own a sewing machine . " " Well , that 's not such a difficult one . For that we only need money . " Remembering the small amethyst brooch that belonged to Dovid 's grandmother , Chavala thought she needed a machine much more . Her sisters should be dressed decently . . . " I have the money , Dovid ... " " How do you happen to have the money ? " " From the dowry I held out on you , " and not wanting to press the matter she nestled close in Dovid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , Dovid , do you realize you have n't made love to me for . . . well , I wonder if you still know how ? " Putting his mouth to hers he kissed her and whispered , " I still know how . " And , blessedly , there was no more talk that night . Cynthia Freeman 72DOVID bought an old sewing machine from an Arab tailor in Jerusalem , which raised Chavala 's spirits considerably . In the marketplace she bought material and set herself to making peasant skirts and blouses like the ones they 'd worn at home . She made an especially beautiful one for Sheine . As she admired it a sudden thought grew . . . why should n't she find a small stall and become a merchant herself . . . ? The idea alone made her excited , even more so when she imagined Dovid sharing the stall with her . Here they were , both of them strong , each with a good trade , and Dovid seemed to be wandering aimlessly about . Good God , why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for Dovid to come home . When he did , for the first time since their marriage , angry words erupted between them . " I did n't come to Eretz Yisroel to be a ghetto bootmaker . " Chavala stopped her pedaling and looked across to where Dovid sat on the rickety wooden chair . " You 're not going to be a bootmaker ? What then , a doctor ? " He ignored the sarcasm . " Chavala , we both know that this is not why we came to Eretz Yisroel . " " I thought we came to escape the pogroms . " " That 's true , but there must be a deeper meaning to our lives . Surviving is n't enough ... " " Not being killed has plenty of meaning for me . At least the Turks do n't massacre us . " " Chavala , let 's not play games . We did n't run away to settle behind a ghetto wall . Look how we 're living . " Her pulse beat a little faster with hope . Maybe Dovid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then this is n't what you expected it to be ? " " You 're right , Chavala , I did n't come to pray at the Wall . You know what I want . " Of course . . . for a moment she had allowed herself to think he 'd changed his mind , wanted to choose America with her . . . Yes . . . she knew what he wanted . . . to live in the wilderness on some Godforsaken kibbutz , but if she gave in to that she could forget about ever leaving Palestine . When the time came she would fight him . She had something coming to her too , her dream of America . . . " I do n't see anything so terribly wrong with the way we 're living . . . if you wanted to make a living you could  --  " " I know . . . I could be a bootmaker . Well , I wo n't do it , Chavala , not even for you . I want to help build a land  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to build a land . It 's already built . " " But America is not our country . This is . " " Is it ? Forgive me , but this country belongs to the Turks and Bedouins , and the decay and rot and pestilence . Please , Dovid , let the Lovers of Zion have their fantasy , but I 'm afraid Jews will never have a country . We will always be the intruders who plead with the world to just let us survive . Only in America , Dovid , can you and I really be free . " " No . This land , by rights , belongs to us , and one day , Chavala , we 'll have it . " " You 're still back in Reb Kaufman 's basement , listening to that great sage , the Bilu who came from Palestine to save us . To build a country . But how can you build a country when you ca n't even buy land ? " " Legally , as individuals , no . But in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements are being established ... " Chavala loved Dovid so she found it almost impossible to deny him ... except , she could n't help thinking , why was it always she who had to give in ? But what she said was , " What about my father ? You know he 'd never leave Jerusalem . " " I 've thought about that . Sheine 's old enough to take care of him . It is n't that I do n't love him , Chavala , I do . But you and I have a life to make  --  " " And what about the rest of the family ? Have you thought about them too ? " " Yes . . . whoever wants , can come . It 's for them to make the choice . But you , little Chia and I will go . " " I did n't say that I would  --  " " I 'm begging you , Chavala . If we 're to find a life , it ca n't be here in Jerusalem . " But all she could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they slept back to back . The next morning as she watched Dovid leave in anger , Chavala was reminded of another day , a day that now seemed so far away . . . their wedding night . But at least it served to remind her that Dovid Landau was not a man to be wrapped up like a package . For all his kindness and love , he expected his wife to love him enough to go with him . She was his wife , and since the days of Ruth a wife went where her husband went . Ile did n't say when he would return , and her heart heat too fast as she fought back the tears .. . Cynthia Freeman 74DOVID had journeyed far into the hills of Metullah , dodging the maraudingBedouins , spurred on by his hope of finding land to settle on ... But that hope was soon crushed when he found that at the settlement of the Baron de Rothschild only Arabs were employed . Not one Jew worked the land  --  it was cheaper for the baron to hire fellaheen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseers , and they had been imported from France , as had been the agriculturists who taught the Arabs how to farm . He felt duped , deceived by the Lovers of Zion who had filled his and so many other minds with visions of a Jewish utopia . Angry , frustrated , he left and went back to Jerusalem ... . At Mea Shearim Dovid found a job as a stonecutter , working with his brother-in-law Moishe . As he chipped away through the rough rock , he thought , well , at least better this than a bootmaker . " I 'm a builder , a builder of dreams , " David Ben-Gurion had said to him that night . Here , cutting the stone , at least in a small way he was helping to rebuild the land . This stone would go into new dwellings to build a country .. . When he returned home that evening his disappointment over not being able to work in the fields was so great he said nothing about working for the diminutive Yemenite in Mea Shearim . Chavala , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since Dovid would say nothing to her , well , she would n't ask why he had stayed away , where he had been . . . She would n't even tell him she 'd missed him . . . oh God , how she 'd missed him .. . That evening was only a prelude to the week that came . Each morning he left for Mea Shearim only to return silent , withdrawn . After a week Chavala could no longer stand it . That night she moved closer to her husband , waited for him to turn to her . . . he only lay there , rigid , his back to her . Getting out of bed , Chavala began to pace the small room . Her anger had gone to hurt , and the hurt eventually became guilt . . . he was her husband , and there came a time when it no longer mattered who was right , who was wrong . " Dovid , how long is this going to go on ? " Silence . " Dovid , please , speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know how to solve this , I do n't . " Again , silence . " Dovid , there must he an answer , let 's try to find it  --  " " Do you think you could stand the truth ? " " What 's the truth , Dovid ? " No Time For Tears 75 " That you are my wife and your place is with me . You know why I came . My reasons are the same . " " But what about the family ? How can I leave them  --  ? " " Look , damn it , I love them too . . . but do n't we have a right to our own lives ? Maybe it was foolish , but I honestly believed that once your father was settled we would be free to leave Jerusalem . I was even foolish enough to believe that after all we went through in Russia that you too would see that our only hope for survival was an Eretz Yisroel restored . I was wrong . I 'm not blaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " And I 'm sorry for that , Dovid , truly sorry , so what do we do . . . ? " " Chavala , as much as I love you and the family I ca n't stay here and rot . . . give up my mission . When two people ca n't share the same needs and hopes , well , I suppose you must do what you feel best . I wo n't beg anymore . The decision is yours , but I tell you . . . I must leave here or I 'll just cease to exist ... " The words cut through Chavala like a knife . If she did not go with Dovid she would lose him , and if she went her family might be lost , especially her father . . . she tried separating the pieces . In her heart she knew the answer . . . her place was with her husband . . . " All right , Dovid , have you decided where you want to go ? " " Yes , to the Galilee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it very far ? " " From Jerusalem , yes . " " Is n't it possible to find a settlement closer to Jerusalem where you could be happy ? " " I wish you could have said we instead of . . . never mind . . . most of the settlements are failing , Chavala , but at least there 's hope in the Galilee . " And he proceeded to explain that a strain of wheat had recently been discovered by a man named Aaron Aaronson , whose fame as an agronomistwas worldwide . On his recommendation the purchase of a large parcel of land had been made from an absentee Arab effendi who lived in luxury in Beirut . The discovery held the promise that the Galilee could become the most productive farming area in Eretz Yisroel , and five American Jews of great wealth were contacted . Their allegiance to the rebirth of Palestine was as deep and strong as those who had inhabited the land for centuries . They too had once fled the ghettos of Russia and Poland . It took little persuasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zion Settlement Office in Jaffa and five thousand dunams of land now belonged to them . Cynthia Freeman 76When the effendi signed over his ownership he looked at the documentand considered the Jews to be , as always , stupid fools . They had purchased a parcel of swamp and malaria-ridden earth that could never be redeemed . It was a place , in fact , where even birds of prey never ventured , but Jews were children of death anyway and he had properly disposed of this uninhabitable scourge , this abominable cancer in the earth , by selling it to the lowest of human vermin . Twenty-five men , one single woman and four married couples with small children accepted the challenge . This settlement would be worked for Jews by Jews and when they reclaimed the land , as they were determined to do , it would be because of the sweat and toil of their hands . They would be in debt to no one . No foreign administrator and no baron . It would be a commune based on social equality , democratic justice . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , educationand the rearing of children would be implemented by the consent of all . And so this small group of people set out to prove to the world that they were more than idealistic dreamers .. . It was a moving story , but Chavala was still desperately unhappy with the choice she had to make . How to prepare her father ? Still , she decided , finally , that her place was with Dovid . The debate was over . . . " I 've decided to go , but dear God , how do we tell papa ? " " He trusts you , Chavala  --  if only you could convince him to come with us . " " Oh , Dovid , you know he would never do that , for him Eretz Yisroel means Jerusalem . " Dovid knew Chavala was right . " We 'll do the best we can .. . Chavala , I will try to make you happy , I love you very much ... She put her head on his shoulder . " I love you too , Dovid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " she smiled " . . . considering the way I act sometimes . " THE next night after supper , the family around the kitchen table , Chavala 's courage almost collapsed as she tried to explain the reasons they had to leave , and Dovid felt at once grateful and guilty . " Papa , please , I beg you , come with us . " His hands shook slightly as he embraced his holy hook . " Never ... " The old man sat with his head bowed , then looked at Dovid . " And you , who I 've considered a son , have forsaken mc , listened to false prophetsNo Time For Tears 77 ... I know about your Zionists , and to them I can . . . I came to this place because it is written that from the seed of Abraham  --  " Dovid did not want to hear the rest of the quotation . Moishe thought back to those days when he 'd first heard about the Lovers of Zion and knew that he felt like Dovid . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was an old man who was like iron in his determination to live out his days as he felt he must . Well , Moishe would do the same . . . " Papa , please try to remember that I love you , but I must go with Dovid and Chavala . " The old man slowly shook his head , it was a new world where respect and honor were no longer important to show a father . He was losing his children . As if reading his mind , Moishe said , " Papa , if you love Eretz Yisroel as you say , you must see how very important this is to us . We were once a great nation and we must be that again . It 's for us , papa , to make the greatness of our people known to the world . " Now the old man was not listening . His children , it seemed , all of them , had become bewitched by the devil . . . " And you , Dvora , what about you ... ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eyes , " Please forgive me , papa , but I want to go with the rest . " Gently he released her . " Better that you should ask God to forgive you . . . and you , Sheine , you will go too ? " " No . I 'll never leave you . Let them go , papa , we can get along without them . They do n't seem to need us or want us  --  " " What a thing to say , Sheine , " Chavala told her . " I think what you 're doing is shameful , leaving your father . Families do n't separate . But do n't worry , Chavala , we wo n't die just because you and Dovid go off . Maybe life is just too difficult for you here . You know , Chavala , you think the whole world will fall apart if it were n't for you  --  " Chavala 's anger flared and she actually slapped her sister , and then just as quickly it died as she took her sister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " I 'm sorry . . . this is a time of great emotion , Sheine  --  " Sheine pulled herself away from Chavala and stood up . " Oh , I thinkyou 'll recover , after all , Chavala , you should go where your husband wants . Now , I think the others should make a decision : How about you , Raizel ? " For Raizel it was like being cut in two . One part wanted to stay withpapa , the other to go with Chavala . She too craved flowers and green grassCynthia Freeman 78and sheep . She loved the pictures of shepherds and their flocks , and she hated the crowded , narrow stone alleys here where the children had to play . There was no sun here , she longed just to see a blue sky . They rarely went beyond the confines of where they lived . The only beauty Raizel ever saw was when she stood on a chair and looked out to the Mount of Olives , and now , to be separated from Chavala . . . after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nursed her ? . . . Still , she loved papa too . And seeing him in such distress , she put her arms around him and said , " I 'll stay . " None of them slept that night . The next morning Dovid went to the donkey cart . The mule that was to take them across the country looked sick and mangy , but Dovid could hardly complain since it had been loaned to him by the Sephardic Jew in Mea Shearim , who was no longer his boss . It was enough that the man had trusted him to return it . Since there were no possessions to take along , except a small amount of bedding and clothing , the cart was ample for them . Dovid strapped the sewing machine to the side of the cart , then tied the goat to the back of the cart , wondering if perhaps he should n't reverse the two animals . The goat seemed the more sturdy of the two . Chavala , huddled close to Moishe , watched Dovid as he stood holding the reins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ached as she thought of the tears that ran down papa 's cheeks , how old and pathetic he seemed as he stood with Sheine on one side and Raizel on the other , watching them vanish out of the city . And Sheine for all her strength of will had broken down at the end and clung sobbing in Dovid 's arms . Poor , dear Sheine , who was always so afraid to show her true feelings , always fought the fears of letting anyone know how much hurt she locked away inside . Of course she had held Dovid . . . he was like her brother , someone she had shared her precious , and too brief , childhood years with , as they all had , but now he was also their protector , he had become their strength and she must have felt terribly abandoned .. . And what about her ? . . . well , she loved Dovid , but she was also upset with him at this moment because he was , she felt , sending them into exile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? At least when they had stayed together as a family , life seemed bearable , but now . . . The next four days were almost beyond even Chavala 's stamina . They were put up for the night at the settlements along the way . After a meal of thin barley soup and bread and a cup of wheat tea Chavala was only too happy to go to the tent with little Chia . It seemed the only joy she had was in the baby . She had become so winsome , Chavala would never have believed that that shrunken little ( loll was going on tenNo Time For Tears 79months . Instead of the hardships making her irritable , she seemed to thrive . It was almost as though she understood all the reasons not to be difficult . Chavala , hugging little Chia to her , would fall asleep with the child . Dovid , on the other hand , sat up until all hours discussing , debating , talking with the chalutzim . The stamina of these people was unbelievable . They worked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much they took shelter in the only building erected on the commune , where they repaired tools , made chairs and tables so that when the time came and they had housing they would be ready ... . What time Dovid finally crept into the cot beside her , Chavala never knew . But she did know that at four-thirty in the morning they sat with the chaverim and ate the usual breakfast of cucumbers , tomatoes , black bread and tea . This particular morning the meal was sumptuous . One egg a week was what the chalutzim had , and the Landaus happened to be fortunate enough to be present for it . Then , amid a cheerful good-bye , they were once again on the road which would bring them closer to their journey 's end . Morning , which had started out with the delights of an egg , gave up its early promise as the mule suddenly halted , lay down on the ground and died . Dovid did n't seem surprised , in fact he was grateful that the beast had lasted as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dovid 's stoicism . . . fatalism ? . . . but the heat beating down on them so brutally made her especially worried about baby Chia , who had a heat rash from head to toe . In her irritation , and as if to underline it , she asked in Yiddish , upsetting , she knew , to her husband , " Tell me , Reb Landau , how do you plan to get us to this golden medina ? " He pointedly replied in Hebrew , " Chavala , you should n't worry , let me do that . I assure you , we 'll get there . " " I have no doubt , but I asked how . " " That , my dear Chavala , is no problem . Moishe , you take one pole and I 'll take the other . " " You mean you 're replacing the donkey ? You 're walking to  --  " " Moishe , " Dovid said , " come help me get the reins off the mule and out of the way . " Dear God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Chanukah . Chavala 's timing was somewhat off . After an exhausting day , at dusk , Dovid let go of his pole and lifted Chavala out of the cart . Taking her in his arms he kissed her as the sweat poured from his bcxly . " Look , Cynthia Freeman 80Chavala , look down below , our beautiful Sea of Galilee . Have you ever seen anything so beautiful ? " and then he called out , " Come here , Dvora , Moishe , I want you to remember this moment all your lives . " The sight was indeed magnificent . The sun reflected golden on the gentle ripples . A mist , like gossamer , hovered above . The water looked so tranquil , so lovely , shimmering there , waiting , inviting . The descent was so steep and the roads so narrow Dovid was afraid the cart might turn over , so , since goats were mountain climbers , he hitched theirs to the cart . Leaving the sewing machine intact , Moishe led the animal down . Dovid helped Chavala , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . Breathless , grateful that they 'd arrived , they stood for a moment regaining their strength . But as Chavala looked about , reality replaced illusion . From above , the magnificent haze that hovered over the Galilee was now almost grotesque . What they had seen was a mist that rose above the stagnant swamps . The denuded , eroded hills seemed to be weeping , the fields were of rock for as far as the eye could see , the earth was unfertile , thanks to a thousand years of violation at the hands of invaders who had ravaged it and left it to die . What Dovid 's reactions were , Chavala could n't tell . If he felt as she did , he hid it very well . Too well . . . Chavala followed him until they finally reached the settlement  --  one flimsy building erected on the edge of the swamps , the rest tents . Still , they were welcomed and then were assigned to a tent . That night Chavala lay awake desperately trying to justify Dovid taking them to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt haunted by her father 's face , her guilt at leaving him . . . she and Sheine had parted without love , and poor little Raizel was losing her whole childhood . She fell asleep from exhaustion , her face still wet from her tears . THE next morning Moishe and Dovid set out with the rest of the chaverim to work . And in the days that followed they labored from sunup to sundown . . . trying to push back the marshland and swamps . By way of America hundreds of Australian eucalyptus trees arrived to be planted , to soak up the stagnant waters . Drainage ditches were dug , handful by handful , the work almost beyond human endurance . They worked waistdeepin the mud , through the terrible heat of the summer and the abominable cold of winter . The rocks had to be dragged by teams of donkeys and the thick underbrush hacked away and burned . Their focalNo Time For Tears 81was sparse , all they owned was what they wore on their backs , and the labor force was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dovid , among them , lay on his bed convulsing with the disease . His condition was so severe Chavala had to doubt his recovery . Day and night she sat by his bed , feeding him quinine , sponging his body and thanking God that she had Dvora to take care of little Chia , and that Moishe had already recovered from this dreadful disease . Weak as he was , he went back to work , although she pleaded with him to rest for a few more days . He shrugged . " When we have a real kibbutz , I 'll remember what it took to build this one . " Chavala looked at him and swallowed hard . Moishe , she realized , was proud that he was a part of the land now , and wore his illness like a campaign ribbon . Finally Dovid did recover , and his attitude was much like Moishe 's ... he went back to the swamps almost as soon as he could stand . While the work in the fields was going on , three clapboard sheds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting room , the other a tool shed and barn , the third , a community barracks . Although thin partitions were provided for the five married couples to have a little privacy , they would all sleep under the same roof and share common showers and toilets . When these were completed a much-needed celebration was held . There was little to feast on but they still rejoiced . In the evening a bonfire was lit and they danced the hora until dawn . Indeed , they rejoiced . Chavala 's pleasure was , as always , tempered by her longing for her family , but when she risked confiding in the other women they all but laughed at her sentimentality . The problem with Chavala , they said , was that she lived too much in the past . She had n't really escaped the shtetl . . . her problem was n't her longing and love of the old place but her Jewish guilt ... " Wake up to today , " one said , " we 've been so conditioned by family obligations , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghetto of your mind , there is n't much hope that you 'll make it in Eretz Yisroel . " No , Chavala found no comfort in them . In fact , she felt alienated from these women , who seemed to revel with an almost religious zeal that at last they had attained the same kind of rights as men , working side-bysidein the fields , ploughing the earth , draining the swamps , removing the rocks and refusing to he treated as women . Sonia Chernik lived openly without shame with Yudel I , iebowitz , which even Chavala found difficult to accept . Traditions were rejected , pushed aside ... . Cynthia Freeman 82Once they 'd rolled up their tents and moved into the barracks , a meeting was called . Leah Abramowitz and her husband marched into the meeting hall and sat next to the four other married women . As the proceedings began , Leah , who had been appointed the women 's leader , stood in front of the assembly dressed in a pair of her husband 's workpants . " We , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since we do the work of men we expect that you men should share the work that was thrust on us only because we are women . " Yudel Liebowitz , the head of the committee , asked her , " What is it that you wo n't accept ? " " All responsibility for the cooking , kitchen chores , housekeeping and the rearing of children . " There was more than a murmur of dissent from the single men . Sonia Chernik , the second in command , brought down the gavel . " This meeting will be conducted with decorum . Anyone who wants to debate will have their chance . But comrade Leah will be heard . " Knowing Sonia would be in sympathy with their petition , Leah nodded and began , " As of today I insist that the work be rotated . The men will assume the same amount of hours in the kitchen , cooking and in the tending of children , since this is the responsiblity of the entire community and not ours alone because we are women and wives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out , " You forgot to say one thing , comrade Leah , will you also allow us to give birth ? " Jeers and whistles of approval echoed in the barnlike room . The gavel came down sharply . Yudel called out , " This is a democraticmeeting . You 've been told that each of you will have an opportunity for rebuttal . Now I call for silence . " He looked over the group and asked that Leah please finish . " I 'd be delighted , " she said , " but first , an answer to comrade Shmuel 's question . Yes , you will be allowed to give birth when you are equal to women and can stand the pain . " Three of the wives applauded . Leah nodded her thanks . " Now , I ask that the vote be taken . " The twelve members of the committee reached for the ballots and wrote their answers . Then Sonia read them aloud , " Eight against , four in favor . Now it goes to the assembly , since it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of hands ? " Of the fourteen members , Dovid voted along with the nine remainingchalutzirn . No Time For Tears 83Leah rose quickly and delivered a swift volley of words . " We do not accept this . We will exercise our rights  --  " " And what are they ? " asked a stern Sonia . " Strike ! In this commune there are no serfs , damn it . " Silence fell over the room . Chavala looked at Dovid . Since he was against the proposal , and since the committee had said debate was permissible , she raised her hand . Yudel acknowledged her . " You have three minutes . " That was n't quite fair . Leah had been given ten . " I do n't want to work in the fields . I will , though , take on the responsibility of the kitchen . With the help of my sister Dvora we 'll also take over the care of the children . " Chavala did n't quite realize that with such words she 'd finished herself with the other women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice-chairman . " You , Chavala , have been uncooperative since you arrived . You are nothing but a ghetto Jew . . . with the mentality of a ghetto Jew , and I think that 's what you always will be . " Chavala lashed back . " And you are very democratic so long as no one disagrees with you . I have as much right to my feelings as you to yours  --  " The gavel came down , Yudel announced , " You may be seated . " " But what about taking the vote on my petition ? " " Be seated . " The single men whistled and applauded for Chavala . A woman was a woman , and a woman belonged in the kitchen , never mind that they worked in the fields . They still could not do a man 's job , it was ridiculous to think otherwise . What kind of a man would do housekeeping , much less take care of children ? Dovid spoke up to defend his wife . " I believe tonight 's meeting has been biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal slander that has nothing to do with the petition . The female members , all of them have the right to petition , but a vote was taken and it was voted down  --  " Leah stood immediately , shaking her fist at Dovid . " As of this moment , my fellow comrades and I strike ! " And all four women and Sonia walked out . Dvora looked at Chavala . Yes , she loved her sister with all her heart , but this was different , it had nothing to do with loyalty and love , it had to do with ... well ... what was fair . . . she knew that Chavala was not a ghetto Jew , but she also knew that Chavala had tried to walk in theCynthia Freeman 84footsteps of mama . She wanted to be like mama and carry on a traditional home , and here she just was n't able to . Dvora had to admit to herself that she was n't entirely like Chavala . Her feelings were much like the other women 's . She wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . She wanted the freedom men were privileged to , that Moishe had . She wanted to walk out with the others , feeling the strike was justified , and she would tell Chavala so ... . After a week of cooking for the whole community , even though she had the reluctant help of Dvora , Chavala , not surprisingly , collapsed . As she lay on her cot , with Dovid holding her hand , she looked at him and said , " I 'm afraid my spirit was stronger than my body ; I thought I could do it , Dovid , I honestly did . " " I know , and I love you because you tried so hard , but how in the world could you do the work of five women ? Now rest , I insist on it . " Without Chavala , and the other women on strike , the men realized their cause was lost . If they intended to eat they 'd better also learn how to cook . " So , " laughed Leah to the victorious women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We really need them only if we want to have children . Once that 's over . . . they ca n't even scramble an egg . We not only can scramble eggs , we can perpetuate the race , we can clear the fields , " and on and on . The men gave in , they had no alternative if they did n't want to starve . Chavala , though , still resented that their lives all but belonged to the community . . . she badly missed a home of her own , remembered all too well that first seder she and her sisters prepared after mama had died . Sorry , ladies , but she felt like a woman , and to her a woman was a very special thing . Yes , she admitted , she missed that little hovel , and living together in these tight communal quarters was almost strangling her . Everything was brought before the governing body . Even the clothes they wore on their backs belonged to the community . Now , even Dvora had alienated herself from Chavala by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt more alone than she had at any time in her life . She had no one to speak to , not even Dovid , because she did n't want to add to the other burdens of his life . In the fall of that year Sonia announced she was expecting a child , and without fuss her marriage was sanctioned by the common consent of the committee . A petition was presented . Since Sonia 's child would he the first born on the commune she decided that there was a more advantageousway to accommodate working parents ... The plan was n't intendedNo Time For Tears 85to ignore the children 's needs , she said , rather to give them a greater sense of security because the whole community would take responsibility for their welfare . If they were to grow up secure in a country that lived each day on the edge of danger , it was important for them to be raised independent of their natural parents . If these children were deprived of a family , the loss would be less difficult for them to accept . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A vote was taken , and the majority agreed . Chavala sat in utter disbelief . She would never have believed that Jewish mothers would reject the raising of their children . She had lost her mother , and the bereavement was great , but still she had survived . ActuallyChavala suspected Sonia had proposed this because having a child was a burden to her . She did n't know if she much liked this new breed of Jews .. . Chavala 's fears grew as she watched the children 's house being built . When the building was finished , little Chia , now a year and a half , was installed with the other children , and Chavala was beside herself . The next morning she went to see Chia but was told that if the child was to adjust to this new environment , visiting privileges would have to be restricted to certain hours during the day . Chavala had had enough . She swooped little Chia up in her arms and left without a word . Leah and Sonia looked at each other . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the mentality of a ghetto Jew , obviously this will be taken before the committee . " Sonia nodded . " From the beginning she 's been a problem . . . a misfit .... " Dovid found her waiting in their cubicle , and before he could open his mouth Chavala was half-talking , half-crying , " I 've tried , Dovid . . . I really have , but I just ca n't go on living this way . I 've no one here , not even you . We barely have a moment together . Our lives belong to the community . I 'm sorry , but our child will be raised in a home , our home , with a mother and father  --  " Our child . . . ? " How long have you known ? " " You have n't been listening , Dovid , I said I refuse to go on like this  --  " " I heard . I mean , how long have you known that you 're expecting ? " " For a month ... " He 'd resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being able to conceive . Now . . . " There are no words to tell you what I feel , " he said as he held her close , stroking her hair . " Oh , Chavala , what can I say ? " Cynthia Freeman 86She separated herself from him and looked directly at him . Don ' t be frightened to speak out , she told herself . And to him , " You can say that we 'll leave . " Dovid knew she was right . He had been selfish , thinking only of what he wanted . Like an ostrich he 'd buried his head in the sand for a year . But he could no longer do that . She was his life , without her there would be nothing . . . " We 'll leave , darling . Do you remember the settlement we stayed in at  --  ? " " I do n't want to live on a settlement , Dovid . I just do n't fit into this kind of life . Please sit down , Dovid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , " You want to be a farmer , all of you want to be farmers , but how can that be when none of you know how to use a plough ? Darling , you do n't know a hen from a rooster . All I 've heard in the last year is when the land is cleared the planting will start . Nothing seems to make any sense . Maybe I should thank the women for ignoring me ... I 've learned a lot from the chalutzim , among them that your idol Aaron Aaronson has a training farm at Athlit , and that there 's a village called Zichron Yaakov . I remember the day when Aaronson rode into the settlement on that white stallion . He 's a great man , Dovid , and a great teacher . . . you 'll become more than a farmer . With his help you might become . . . what 's it called ? . . . an agronomist . Dream big dreams , Dov-id ... " The next day Dovid went before the committee and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a show of laying hands on her bulging stomach . She 'd gone on working in the fields alongside her husband , even though she was expecting at any moment . But Chavala , of course , was a peasant with a ghetto mentality . She should have stayed in the shtetl , the community would be well rid of her kind . The fact that Dovid , Moishe and Dvora had worked as hard as the others was now irrelevant . This commune only had room for those who were completely dedicated . Dovid went out and looked at the land he 'd helped to clear . He had made his contribution , but he felt a deep regret knowing he would not be there when the first crop was harvested . Quickly he went back , gatheredhis family together and left . Chavala 's happiness could scarcely be contained as the wagon slowly made its way back toward Jerusalem . " There had never been a day in the past year she had not dreamed of this moment . No Time For Tears 87WHEN they finally arrived she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw open the door . At the sight of her father she could not hold back the tears . Holding his frail body close , she was shocked by the change in him . . . he had aged so . Backing off to look and smile at him , she saw that his face was creased with what seemed a thousand folds . His back was more bent , his hands gnarled with painful arthritis . " You 've come home , Chavala . . . my children have come home , my prayers have been answered ... " Chavala swallowed , knowing that they had not just returned for him ... but for her . . . and that they would soon be leaving again .. . Sheine looked knowingly at Chavala , and in spite of herself took pleasure in her sister 's obviously guilty feelings of pain . . . she knew they were going on to Zichron . Chavala had mentioned it in the letter that had come four days ago . " Yes , papa has indeed prayed , welcome back , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Arab . But look at you , Moishe . You left a boy and came back a man ... " " You 're the only one who has n't changed , Sheine , " Dvora answered with anger close to the surface . You 're as spiteful as ever , you have n't forgiven us for leaving , she wanted to shout out , but for the sake of her father she held her tongue . Raizel could have told Dvora that she was wrong , that Sheine had in fact changed more than any of them . . . Quite by accident Raizel had found a diary Sheine kept , and although she knew it was very wrong to invade Sheine 's private thoughts , once she 'd begun it was impossible to stop . Page after page was filled with her love and longing for Dovid ... how she dreamed of him making love to her in the night . She alone knew the source of Sheine 's bitterness , understood it , and so tried to please , even appease her poor , tormented sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fashion , more than any of them . The following week 's parting was even more traumatic than the first . Avrum wept , beyond consolation . He took his children to him , hugged them with surprising strength . . . the strength of profound fear . . . Would he live to see his grandchild ? Only God knew the answer for sure . At least Avrum , in blessed mortal ignorance , could hope . Cynthia Freeman 88Chapter FiveIF IT COULD N'T be America , at least Zichron Yaakov was a village that Chavala could understand . True , these pioneers had come from another part of Europe , but the settlement looked as though it could have been transplanted from the shtetl she had left in Odessa . Small stone houses stood clustered together , each with its own small vegetable garden , and palm trees dotted the landscape . There were marketplaces in the square , and benches where the women sat and exchanged bits of gossip . The ritual baths and the shul truly made Chavala think she was home . Of course if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have equaled that of earlier arrivals .. . The original founders of Zichron Yaakov were a handful of humble tradespeople who had come in a group from Roumania in 1882 , and among them were the parents of Aaron Aaronson , a man who would play a central role not only in the life of the Jewish nation , but in the lives of Dovid and Chavala . They knew little about Palestine . What they found was a remote , neglected Asiatic province in the vast Ottoman Empire . They knew nothing about agriculture or colonization . They knew not one of the languages spoken in Palestine . But they 'd come out of love for the land of Israel , a desire to reclaim its soil to enrich their lives and the lives of their children . When their ship entered the port of Haifa they were faced with this newly issued edict : " Jewish immigrants are forbidden to land on the coast of Syria and absolutely forbidden to live in Palestine . This prohibition is final , any infraction of this law will result in imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The sultan , suspicious of European " philanthropists "  --  especially British  --  trying to buy large tracts of land in Palestine allegedly for Jewish settlements , worried that the European powers were merely using the Jews as a front to get a toehold in Palestine . He was , of course , right about that . But this handful of Jewish pilgrims were hardly aware of such political shenanigans . They were sincere , driven , and now the door to Palestine was closed to them . They stood on deck , silent and bewildered . There seemed nothing to do but return to Roumania . Except Ephraim Aaronson thought otherwise . He was a large man , and with a determination to equal his size , he said , " We have not traveled this far and given up so much to return defcated " The Turkish governNoTime For Tears 89ment never officially lifted its restrictions , but a few , including the Aaronsonsand their friends , made it into Palestine and eventually to Zichron , a place steeped in the disease and neglect of centuries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or more huts occupied by the Arab fellaheen , who , left to their own devices , grew only enough to feed their emaciated bodies . In the beginning the Jews , like the Arabs , lived in huts made of branches covered with mud and roofed with straw mats . Their first permanentstone houses had to be built furtively , with the help of judicious bribes , since it was against Ottoman law for noncitizens to build . But their problems had only begun . The land bought for them was rocky and arid , impossible to till , and the plain that stretched between Mount Carmel and the coast was nothing but swamps , breeding ground for malaria . Funds in Roumania that had been pledged dried up when those who intended to follow became aware of the hostile Turkish government . The pioneers in Zichron were forced to fight against a corrupt , hostile government alone . In that first year everything went against them . Turkish restrictions demanded bribery and more bribery . The limited possessions they still had were all but exhausted . Gold wedding bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rations of food became more stringent , and the small amount of money that trickled in from Roumania was too little to fend off the gluttonous appetite for baksheesh that the Turks demanded . The meager crops failed , malaria took its toll , and no matter how Ephraim Aaronson debated with himself that this settlement would someday be self-supporting , he knew that their only survival lay in the hands of the French philanthropist Baron de Rothschild , whose plantations were already established in Palestine . Pride at this moment was a bitter thing to swallow , but it was better than certain death . Aaron Aaronson was six when his parents first came to Palestine . Zvi , Shmuel , Alex and the two girls , Sarah and Rivka , were all born in Zichron , by that time settled with a hundred families . The Aaronsons were considered the leading family . . . indeed , there was a strange mystery about them , in spite of their friendliness . The style of their lives was unlike any in Zichron . They lived in a rambling , twostorystone dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered the house from the brutal , burning sun . Lace curtains and wooden shutters hung at the windows . In Zichron Malka Aaronson created a culture all its own for her large family . In a place of honor stocxl a grand piano , where her two daughtersCynthia Freeman 90entertained the family with the duets she had taught them . Bookshelves that lined the walls included volumes of Shakespeare , and Aaron 's own special library consisted of the oldest and latest editions of scientific agriculture , geology , Latin and botany . The Aaronsons grew up on their high hilltop , passionately devoted to each other and to the wild country that had become a part of them . Inspired by the Bible , and their parents ' ideals , the Aaronsons created a world removed from the grim realities surrounding them . They did not see themselves as children of struggling farmers living in a decadent Ottoman Empire , rather as heirs to an ancient people and a noble heritage . Their ambitions were not for themselves but for the future of Palestine . Aaron was the idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the age of ten . His curiosity was insatiable , the whole world had hidden secrets that he felt driven to explore . By the time he was twelve he could identify every plant . His quick ear caught the echo of the ancient Hebrew names which the Arabs used . By the time he was fourteen Aaron was the most extraordinary young man in Zichron . His personality , even at that age , was powerful , and the baron became aware of him . At eighteen , under the auspices of his mentor , the baron , he was sent to agricultural school in France . Grignon was heaven to Aaron , a place to gain the knowledge which would allow him to create new agricultural methods in Palestine . Two years later when he returned to Zichron he came back with a degree in agriculture , botany and geology . Aaron was then sent to become an apprentice instructor at the baron 's new settlement in Metullah , up in the wild hills of Galilee . For a young man of twenty , Aaron knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he soon found that the agricultural instructors the baron had hired were arrogant types from his French-African colonies , their minds closed to all Aaron 's knowledge . Aaron knew this country better than they , as well as most of the people who lived there . He could n't be quiet in the face of their contempt for the Jewish settlers , their indifference to Palestine and their misunderstandingof its needs . Inevitably he was dismissed , in fact denounced as a thief . Rumors were started that he 'd stolen much of the scientific data he claimed was his own . Still , the next few years were the time of his greatest scientific discoveries , and they claimed international attention . He was appointed agriculture inspector by the pasha . Now he was able to devote his time to the new settlers and tried working with them , but there were only a rare few that could appreciate and take advantage of his expertise . Besides , a man of science was an oddity in a movement that featured philosophers , religious scholars and writers . Every leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a writer , and all were orators with idealistic speeches . Committee meetings and conferences were the daily bread of the movement , and to manage any agreement before passing a resolution was a major victory . " The committee sickness , " Aaron called it . His approach was different from that of the intellectuals who had come from Russia and Europe . Backward as Palestine was at the beginning of the century , it at least was a land of wide open spaces . Aaron was like the great American pioneers whose vision and ambition had stretched roadways across mountains , and created cities out of desert wasteland . The surveys he had taken of the natural resources of Palestine could be used for plans to develop the country . He spoke out against leaders who could only think in terms of buying small tracts of land and building a few houses on them . Another immigration . . . Russian intellectuals , young men and women who came to create by their own labor a new society in Palestine . They had grown up in the revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first abortive attempt , and they no longer believed , as did many of their comrades who remained in Russia , that the overthrow of the Czarist regime would better the position of the Jews . They now were convinced that the Jewish problem was worldwide and could only be solved when the Jewish people had been rooted in Palestine once again , and as an agricultural people . There ought to have been a bond between Aaron and these young people , but mostly there was an unbridgeable gap . Although they called themselves " the workers " and were known as the " barefoot ones , " they were far from humble . They were steeped in the new socialist ideology , were convinced that they and they alone knew the solutions and should u control the means for building the Jewish national homeland . Above all they believed that Jews must not be dependent on native labor , like the French colonists in Algeria , and the British . The whole economic structurehad to change , as well as the psychology of the old Yishuv . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national economy , dependent on no one 's labor but their own . Each settlement would conduct its own destiny . The old settlements , like Zichron , that had grown up on the baron 's bounty , epitomized the evils of the old society . Well , they 'd no longer allow the settlements to maintain themselves on cheap Arab labor . The most outspoken was Dovid 's old casual acquaintance , David BenGurion , who in a few years became the standard-bearer of the workers ' movement . His and Aaron Aaronson 's goals were the same , but their methods very different . Aaron continued to believe that the only way to organize the country was on a scientific basis , but he also could n't ignoreCynthia Freeman 92the growing movement of socialism , and he found himself veering closer to it . The thing he most admired about Ben-Gurion 's people was their unity . Well , if a national revival was to be a reality , the two factions would have to work together . With science and Jewish labor they would succeed , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For his station Aaron secured funds from such wealthy Americans as Samuel Fels , Julius Rosenwald , Jacob H. Schiff and Nathan Straus , on the indirect recommendation of President Theodore Roosevelt himself ... the president had been impressed by the young scientist when he 'd come to America at the invitation of the Department of Agriculture . Aaron 's station at Athlit was under the protection of the American governmentand he shared the results of his experiments with the United States Department of Agriculture . Aaron 's success at Athlit was so great that Sultan Abdul Hamid II decided the Ottoman Empire had better take advantage of him , Jew or no Jew , and bestowed a gold medal on him , assuring him that , " You are now an Ottoman , the doors of the empire are open to you . " At age thirty-one Aaron was , in a fashion , a kind of founding Jewish prince . The experimental Jewish agricultural station Aaron developed during the next four years was unique in the Middle East , and for his experimental fields he selected a spot known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . on the coastal plain of Sharon , at the foot of Mount Carmel , its sand dunes alternated with malarial marsh . But all about were signs of past populations , and Aaron knew that they could n't have existed if the earth had n't been able to support them . The massive ruin of a medieval castle loomed up from the coastline , the last outpost of the Crusaders in Palestine . On the mainland was a rounded hillock that had been a city when the harbor of Athlit had been a place of commerce and seafaring more than two thousand years earlier . The Roman city of Caesareaspread beneath the sand dunes along the coast to the south of the station , and the Phoenician port of Dor lay in between . Behind on the slopes of Carmel were prehistoric cave dwellings , and later excavations proved their inhabitants to have been the earliest known agriculturists , probably the first to have cultivated the wild wheat of Palestine some eight thousand years before . Aaron chose this spot because he wanted to prove that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a Garden of Eden ... there was something in fruit or in blossom the whole year round . In drought or rain , his fields of wheat , oats and barley flourished , yielding many times more than those of his neighbors although he used no lertiliNoTime For Tears 93zer and the same implements as the Arab farmers . Aaron 's secret was nothing more nor less than the rational application of the techniques of dry farming . Aaron drew around him a small group of devoted young disciples to work with him at the station , and one of them , Aaron 's favorite , was himself a great mind  --  Absalom Feinberg . Absalom was larger than life  --  tall , handsome , ardent , a poet , a lover of music , wise , witty , a crack shot , a dashing horseman , and so fearless that the Arabs had adopted him as their own , giving him the name of Sheikh Salim . Absalom was born in Palestine , his parents Russian intellectuals who came to the country with the first organized group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They settled at Rishon-le-Zion , the first Jewish settlement in the south , between Jerusalem and Jaffa , one of the settlements that Baron de Rothschild had adopted and , as at Zichron , a set of tyrannical officials administered the village 's affairs and directed the settlers ' lives . Israel Feinberg , Absalom 's father , refused to be dominated , and his intense independence led to such a violent protest against the officials that his family was forced to move on , eventually putting down roots at Hadera . Absalom 's education was never interrupted . . . from his grandfather he was taught the Bible , but his father Israel , who realized that the Bible was spiritually rewarding , also knew one day the Jews would inherit their land only if they knew and understood the Arabs . And so he sent Absalom to Jaffa , where he studied Arabic as well as the Koran and by the time his studies were finished he could talk and read Arabic as well as any Arab . By family tradition Absalom was a dedicated Jew , steeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes in his son carefully . He noticed a sort of melancholy that became almost morbid at times . . . the sorrow of the Jewish people ? The injustices against them ? Their perpetual homelessness became the outrage and challenge of Absalom 's life . And his hatred of the Turks was so strong he formed a secret society called the Zion Flag Bearers . For his own sake his father decided Absalom needed to be sent away . His desire to help his people could end in bringing down the wrath of the Turks . Difficult as it was , Israel sent his only child away to France for nearly four years . It did nothing to blur Absalom 's thoughts of getting national rights for Jews . " We are so far from it , " he wrote to his family . " Why should everyone have a nation and we who have given so much ca n't even get a charter from the damned Turks . Palestine means nothing to them , not with their vast empire , but they refuse us only because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more belligerentCynthia Freeman 94than when he 'd left . The Turks were barbarians , and he swore when the day of judgment came he would be prepared . Always in his mind was the thought of rebellion . He talked to Aaron about his burning discontent , but Aaron 's hope and faith was both greater and less bitter than Absalom 's . " With the help of providence and the aid of America we will achieve our goals . " Absalom did n't quite believe that . Aaron was so absorbed in his work it never occurred to him to introduce Absalom to his sister Sarah , although he spoke of her often enough . They had to meet by chance at a social gathering , and by the time the festivities were over Sarah and Absalom knew they felt something special for each other . She was everything in a woman that Absalom wanted . . . beautiful , tall and with a strength and goodness that seemed to come through in her extraordinary face enhanced by wide-set blue eyes . They were not only physically attracted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , literature , exploring the world . She 'd been to Germany , Switzerland and Italy , and Aaron wanted his sisters to see and know the world . But like Absalom , Palestine was the only place on earth Sarah felt content . At home .. . When Absalom was transferred to take over the new station that Aaron had built in Hadera , Dovid replaced him at Athlit , and as the baron had once done in his recognition of Aaron , Aaron in turn took particular notice of Dovid , of his passion and inquiring mind , his feel for the land and growing things . . . Dovid was a born agronomist , and Aaron saw him as an extraordinary future scientist . Shoemaker to agronomist . . . such was the potential for change in these wondrous days . Change and growth .. . For the first time since coming to Eretz Yisroel , Chavala , like Dovid , found herself fulfilled . She adjusted to the life of Zichron . The village ... it seemed transplanted from the one she 'd left , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kitchen became the center of the household , and , what joy of joys , there were three bedrooms . And when Dovid had the time he would add a sewing room , and once again she would take her place as the head of her small family . Bleak and remote as the village might have been , it never seemed so to Chavala . The household work was no drudgery for Chavala and Dvora . She washed stone floors and scrubbed the wooden tables and benches with sand and water . She reveled in watching her family eating the meals she cooked on the iron stove that stood in the corner of the kitchen . She accepted with pride the praise when she brought the loaves of bread cakes and cookies to the table . Their first seder was bittersweet , No Time For Tears 95with the absence of her father and sisters , but when she saw Dovid sitting at the head of his table she told herself a time would come when papa and the whole family would be together . The family .. . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haifa 's Arab market she bought wall hangings . Gradually this was a home that in her wildest dreams she never thought could happen to her . Russia seemed very far away now , and the dream of America became less and less urgent . Yes , she 'd rejected working in the fields of Galilee , but she found planting her own small backyard wonderfully rewarding . With little Chia at her side she planted the seeds that Dovid had brought home to her . Their growth seemed to match the growth she felt in her womb . When the first sprouts came she laughed with delight , and when her small vegetable garden was ready to be taken from the ground , she felt tears in her eyes . Her cherry tree would have made it perfect , but Dovid planted a palm , three olive trees and a few vines for grapes from which she would make wine . Chavala 's life was content . In the afternoon when the work was finished , Dvora and Chavala got dressed up and took Chia for a walk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends with , Chavala and Dvora 's clothes had a bit of style and color . Sarah and Rivka Aaronson , taking their afternoon walks , stopped one day and admired Chavala 's loose-fitting garment , which concealed the tiny bulge beneath it . Sarah had come back from Paris several weeks before with the latest fashion magazines . She would be more than happy , she said , for Chavala to see them . Sarah was rare , as was her sister Rivka . They were accomplished , elegant , and the truth was , Chavala was awed by them . She 'd never known Jews like this .. . they 'd been to France , Switzerland and Italy . For Chavala life had becomesweet . At four of a morning Dovid found her ready to give breakfast to him and Moishe . Then she followed them out the door , standing on the porch and watching as they climbed aboard with the other men onto the wagon that went to Athlit . When they got back in the evening Dovid 's exhaustionwas quickly forgotten as he looked at Chavala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read his books on agronomy and farming that he 'd gotten from Aaronson 's library . At times he might look up and see Chavala , a woman beyond anything he 'd thought possible for him , and his gratitude for her wisdom in insisting that they leave the Galilee and come here was something almost beyond words . Everything seemed so good . Be careful , he told himself . Nothing , as a Jew should know , is forever .. . Cynthia Freeman 96Chapter SixC HAVALA GOT UP from her knees from scrubbing , and , rubbing her back , she felt the beginnings of labor . She went into the kitchen and sat down . As though a dam had burst she held onto the table and watched as water poured from her womb . She was not afraid as she called Dvora . But , coming out of the bedroom , the young girl was petrified as she looked down at the floor now flooded with water . The awful reminder of her mother 's death nearly paralyzed her . . . what if Chavala died ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's fear , Chavala said , " Do n't be frightened Dvora , I 'm young and strong and we 'll soon have the blessing mama must have asked God to give us . Believe that , Dvora . Now , sister , take Chia to Mrs. Bronusky and then tell Mrs. Lieberman to bring the birthing stool . Then go down to Athlit and tell Dovid I want him here . " Dvora could not move , she could not function . " There 's nothing to be afraid of . Now , Dvora , do as I say . " Without a word Dvora left the room , picked up Chia and hurried from the house . As Chavala waited , the thought came back to haunt her . . . the face of her father was as clear as when he stood framed in the doorway on another day such as this . " You should not have sent me away , Chavala , I should have been here to hold her hand as she passed through ... " Chavala would not allow Dovid to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to have the same end . But within herself she knew nothing like that would happen . Still , her hand reached out to the Almighty . Manya was right , God was not to blame for the injustices of man . He had given man a mind that knew what was right and what was evil . Whichever road he decided to take was his choice . This day Chavala felt the presence of God .. . CHAVALA clutched her fists and bit on the rag while Mrs. Liebermanwiped the sweat away . No , she would n't cry out , she wanted this childbrought into the world in joy . There would be no tears . Each time thepain gripped her body she shut her eyes and believed her mother wastalking to her . . . " Soon it will he over and you will hold in your armsthe child that was conceived in love ...

The pain Chavala was bearing in silence frightened her . Why did n't the girl scream out ? Where did her strength come from ? When Chavala gripped the edge of the bed , Mrs. Lieberman looked beneath the cover and saw the beginning of life . Bringing the birthing stool closer she started to help Chavala out of bed but Chavala protested . " No . . . this child will not be born until Dovid comes . " " Chavala , you 've gone mad , the child is ready  --  " " I will have this child when Dovid arrives . " Lying back , Chavala bit on the rag and clutched the mattress . She no longer thought of anything except that Dovid would see his daughter brought to life . God help me . . . mama , take the pain away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with us . . . those days were sweet with honey and we were happy and your beauty shone like . . . I love you , mama , Dovid will soon be here .. . The hours had passed , and finally Dovid was there . He went to Chavala 's side and took her sweating hands in his . He kissed the palms , then her lips . Of all days he 'd been sent to Jaffa for some equipment , and Dvora had frantically been waiting hours for him . When he returned it had seemed an eternity until they reached the hills of Zichron Yaakov . Mrs. Lieberman brushed him aside and helped Chavala to the birthing stool . Breathing heavily and quickly , Chavala had at last found the blessed release from her agony as the midwife gently pulled the child from her womb . Dovid picked up his wife and put her on their bed . " My Dovid , I waited to share this moment ... " " I know , my love . " Tears were in his eyes . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough tears to fill an ocean . Be happy , darling , we have a daughter  --  " " No , " called out Mrs. Lieberman , " you have a son . " " A son ? " " Yes , a beautiful son . And just listen to him yell ! " Chavala had so much wanted to call her mother 's name again , still ... " Bring him to me . " The infant was placed in his mother 's arms . Chavala counted the ten fingers and ten toes , looked at the sweet face . He was Dovid. " 1 AX ) k at your son , Dovid , and never mind what I 've said , it 's right that this child was born in Kretz Yisrocl . " Cynthia Freeman 98Chavala knew about love . . . for family , Dovid . . . but love of one 's own child was of a whole different order . Manya 's words rang in her ears about such blessings . Looking down now at the child in her arms , she thanked God for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... To perpetuate life after death , Chavala remembered , Jews named their children for those who were gone . So Reuven Landau became the living spirit of his grandmother Rivka . Chavala had written to her father and all but pleaded with him and Sheine and Raizel to come to Zichron . She would make the arrangements , but Sheine wrote back to say that papa had not been too well and the trip would be too difficult for him . They 'd shared so much sorrow , Chavala was disappointed that they could n't now share this blessing , but life had to go on , and the tears dried ... . In Zichron Yaakov the bris of Reuven Landau was celebrated with the excitement and joy that all children born in Eretz Yisroel were celebratedwith . To be born in the land of their fathers was a great mitzvah . These children would know what freedom was . At last , at long last they would grow up with honor and pride in their heritage . They would become the true builders of Eretz Yisroel . For them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house of Chavala and Dovid . There was feasting and dancing , and even the Aaronsons paid their respects . Chavala even found herself thinking less and less about the golden shores of America . What still ate at her was that her father and sisters could not share their lives with them . She envied the closeness of the Aaronsons . Well , next week her family would go to Jerusalem . She took out the letter her father had written her , telling how proud he was and that he lived for the moment he could hold his grandson in front of the great Wall . WHEN they entered the Old City of Jerusalem , Chavala 's heart beat quickly in anticipation . She could hardly wait . She rushed up the stairs , but when she came in Raizel 's embrace was not with joy but tears . She looked at Sheine , whose eyes were red and swollen from crying . Breathing unevenly , Chavala asked uneasily , " Where 's papa ? " A long silence , then Shrine answered . " He died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99It was a bad dream , had to be . . . no mention had been made in the letter that he was ill . " It ca n't be true  --  " " It 's true , it 's true , " Sheine repeated . " What happened ? " " He went to the shul in the morning and when they brought him home he was already gone . " Dearest papa , I wasn ' t even here at the end ... " But why did n't you let me know he was sick ? " " He was n't , just old . . . it was his time . " Chavala looked down at her child of three weeks . God took away and God gave . If only she 'd at least been there to see him put in the ground . Her thoughts went to a cemetery in Russia , to mama , who should have been side-by-side with him , reunited in death .. . " Dovid , I want to go to my father 's graveside . " He nodded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olives ... . During the mourning period little was discussed , but now the time was over . " Tomorrow we 'll all go back to Zichron . " Sheine looked first at Dovid , then at Chavala . Instead of her love for Dovid becoming less , it now bordered on unreality . Her fantasies were so heightened that at night she thought only of what it would be like to have Dovid 's child . In her worst delirium she saw Chavala dead and Dovid , of course , turning to her for comfort . She would punish herself for such evil thoughts , pray that nothing would happen to her sister , but she was obsessed . Finally she decided that only by cutting herself off from the familywould she be able to keep her sanity . " I 'm staying here in Jerusalem . " " Since papa 's gone there 's no need for it any longer , Sheine . " " There 's a need for me . I 'm not going to live in a village . What would I do there ? Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Become someone 's chavera ? " " It 's not that way in Zichron  --  " " Maybe not . But I 'm not going to live on charity any longer . " " You would n't be living on charity , Sheine , we 'd all be sharing . And Zichron is n't like the Old City of Jerusalem . It 's lovely . I want you to see it , and our little house , and there 's a little garden . Please , Sheine , come with us . " Sheine stared at Chavala , who blathered on as though she had n't heard a word . " You amaze me , Chavala , what happened to that pioneer spirit ? Your determination to go to America ? You remember when you told me that when papa died nothing could stop you ? Not even DovidCynthia Freeman 100 ... you said he loved you so much that he 'd do anything , even give up " Things change , it does n't seem so important now  --  " " Does n't it ? That 's shocking , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us despise poverty , but I know what 's happened . You 've let yourself be Dovid 's peasant wife . . . what you really want is a stove and a hut and a little plot to plant your vegetables . Yes , you 're a peasant , that 's what you 'll always be . Well , I 've waited a long time to get out of here and be rid of all your beliefs , yours and Dovid 's . I don ' t need you , " and she ran from the room , hysterical . As the rest of the family sat in stunned silence , Dovid got up and went to the girl . Sitting on the edge of the bed , he tried to take her hand but she pulled away and turned her face toward the wall . Softly he said , " Sheine , what 's happened to you ? Please talk to me . " You 're right , Sheine thought , my love for you is so painful , to be this close is agony . " Tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She turned slowly and looked at Dovid , and then finally said it ... " I love you , Dovid  --  " " And I love you too , Sheine , and want to help you . That 's why I want you to come to Zichron  --  " " You did n't hear what I said , Dovid . I love you . " The impact of her true meaning hit him like a thunderbolt . " Sheine , you must n't say that . It 's not true . . . I 'm married to your sister  --  " " How well I know that . But you asked , and now , even if I have no pride , at least now I feel free . Dovid , I 'm not shameless . . . I love Chavala too , but I ca n't help my feelings ... at least now you know why I can never live with the family . " Dovid held his face in his hands . How could he help Sheine , she would never believe that this was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look back on this as just a childish phase . . . ? " You ca n't live alone , Sheine , have you thought of that ? " " Yes , but I do n't intend to live alone . I 'm going to be a nurse . " At least now that he knew , he could understand her behavior . He would have liked to take her in his arms and hold her and tell her that he understood , but under the circumstances that would only be cruel . After a long silence he said , " Come , Sheine , we 're leaving soon . See Chavala . I do n't want to leave without the two of you coming together again as sisters . " She got off the bed , looked once more at Dovid , then without a wordNo Time For Tears 101went to Chavala . They sat awkwardly together , then Sheine said , " Please forgive me , Chavala , if you can . " " There 's nothing to forgive , Sheine . I know how hard life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the worry and responsibility ... but wo n't you please try , at least give it a chance and come home with us ? " She took Chavala 's hands in hers . " Thank you for wanting me , but I 'm sorry . I 've other ideas . . . I 'm going to be a nurse  --  " " When did you decide that ? " " I 've been thinking about it for a long time now . " Chavala looked at her sister 's hand in hers . " It 's been so long sincewe 've been a family . Will you at least come with us for a little while ? " " No , Chavala , I 've already been accepted as a student nurse . " Nothing could change Sheine 's mind . " You 'll write ? " Chavala askedwith tears in her eyes . " We 'll worry about you  --  " " Of course I 'll write , and please do n't worry about me . I know for the first time in my life what I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all . " And at this special moment she truly meant it . Chapter SevenS HEINE , TO KEEP herself sane , had planned , plotted her life with great care . Whenever she had the chance to escape from the Old City , she would wander up the hills to the German hospital and sit on a bench against the wall . She would watch the nurses dressed in their white crisp uniforms that rustled as they went meticulously about their duties . At the end of the long corridor a small group of handsome young doctors stood like disciples , listening to Herr Professor explain the findings of the cases they had seen that morning . This was a special world , a white , immaculate world she longed to be part of . But how ? She became aware of her Jewishness . For the first time her Jewishness became an obstacle , something to wish away . This was her first venture into the world of non-Jews , and the feeling of difference , of being separate , came as a shock . They were fair-skinned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded melodically in her car . . . Christine , Helga , Greta , GretchenCynthia Freeman 102 ... And the German she listened to was softly spoken , not guttural . And speaking Yiddish , she could understand much of what she heard . Comparedto it , Yiddish sounded . . . well , uncouth , smacked of the ghetto . She got up unhappily and left this place she felt she could never enter . Back at her home , she felt so bleak , defeated , she even thought about ending her life that seemed hopeless . But then she thought of all she 'd managed to live through so far and told herself to stop the self-pity and solve her life , not destroy it . So what if she 'd been born Sheine Rabinsky ? That could be changed . But what about her raven hair and deep brown eyes , and the olive tint of her skin ? Papa had allowed no graven images or mirrors in his house , but she 'd hidden a small , broken piece of mirror under her thin mattress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face . . . from her mother she had inherited the delicate features and unblemished , smooth skin . Why , she could pass for some of those French women she 'd seen in Odessa who had married Russian men of nobility . She closed her eyes and tried to imagine herself dressed in finery , and the image became alive . If she changed her name , perhaps ... she suddenly remembered the large bronze plaque that hung in the entry of the hospital inscribed with those who had founded the institution , and the name " Professor Beck " lingered . Why ? Who knew ? But in that moment Sheine Rabinsky became " Elsa Beck . " But what about her coloring ? Her mother was French and her father German . Where was she born , something that could easily be checked up on . She 'd figure that out later . . . she 'd come a long way in her transformation already . She 'd need to absorb it , try to adjust herself to it . . . She took from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away until she had enough to buy a German primer . She slowly accumulated more secondhand books , books on anatomy , Latin and the techniques of nursing . By the time she applied as a student nurse she not only had become Elsa Beck , born in French Equatorial Africa , but she spoke fluent German and her knowledge of nursing was equal to a graduate 's . In two years she had taught herself anatomy and even knew most of the generic names in Latin . She was as obsessed with the task she 'd dedicated herself to as she had been with Dovid . Not a moment was wasted . Scrubbing , cooking , her head was filled with the lessons she was mastering . A dialogue went on constantly . . . she asked the questions , and she answered them . Sheine knew that one deception created another , but at least , she felt , Chavala had to be told . So after one especially grueling day , she wrote to Zichron . No Time For Tears 103CHAVALA sat for a very long time trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answers to why Sheine had done this unbelievable thing . Papa had once said there was a dybbuk in Sheine , but who knew what really had made her go to such extreme lengths ? All Chavala was sure of was that she had failed . She looked at the letter again . . . " So I ask you , Chavala , to explain to the others that if and when you write it will be addressed to Elsa Beck . Please try , if you can , to understand and not to judge me . We all in our own ways must find our own solutions and salvations ... " Chavala could just not accept it , not now . Sheine was lost to them , as lost as if she had died . Which in a way she had . LIFE for Elsa Beck started at five in the morning . The disciplines were rigid , exacting . If a corner of the bed had one small wrinkle , Head Nurse Holstein ripped it off and the student was chastised without mercy and a privilege was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties were handed out . Elsa was , in fact , the most precise , careful and prompt student Nurse Holstein had ever encountered , and for this she gained the admiration of not only Nurse Holstein but the entire staff . Her discipline and devotion did not , however , exactly endear her to her sister nurses . But that did n't bother Elsa Beck . She had become a nurse for the sake of her own survival . She did not fraternize with anyone , and was , not surprisingly , considered a recluse . When graduation came she held highest honors , and now was ready to become a full-fledged member of the elite . Indeed , the first time Nurse Beck walked into the operating room dressed in her surgical garb , she knew the title of Head Surgical Nurse would soon be hers . Long live Elsa Beck . Get thee behind me , Sheine Rabinsky . Chapter EightI WAS N ( 1908 " Nothing rcalk c h ; uit c cl , 1Oislic  --  , " I ) OVI ( I said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  clCynthia Freeman 104that way . How well off were the serfs when they were freed , did they achieve freedom and equality ? No . When slavery in America was abolisheddid the Negroes really become free ? Where were the opportunities for them ? And this new rebellion of the Turks . . . Do you really think they will give us liberty and equality ? A revolution wo n't change hatred felt for the Jews . It 's persisted for over two thousand years . " " But the Yishuv seems to have great hopes that these young Turks will be more sympathetic to our condition  --  " " I hope they 're right , but Chaim Weizmann is n't so optimistic . " " That 's because he 's pro-British  --  " " Which he has reason to be . Britain is the only nation that has listened to him . " " What about the Germans ?

I believe the way Jabotinsky does , that this so-called rebellion of young Turks was only a political maneuver to gain power and not to create any great changes in Palestine for the Jews . Aaron thinks like Weizmann , but he 's in no position to speak out . For years he has worked so closely with the Turks , hoping that eventually the sultan would give Palestine a charter . He may be a dreamer , but he still hopes . " For Chavala , politics was what men constantly , boringly talked about . If a rebellion had occurred , it had n't touched her life here in Zichron . For her there was one small sacred place that seemed impenetrable. . . her home , and her family . Chia had now grown into a chubby three-year-old girl with pink cheeks , blue eyes and fair hair . She was cheerful , precocious , always asking questions . Her devotion to and curiosity about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse him . In her mind she naturally looked on Reuven as her brother , much more than she did Moishe , and Chavala was the mother she had never known . Raizel had grown in grace and loveliness . There was nothing too difficult for her to do as she assumed chores beyond a girl of eleven . Dvora , on the other hand , was a girl of great spirit who had never forgotten the Galilee , and deeply felt a yearning to go back to the land . For weeks she debated with herself , then got up the courage to tell Chavala and Dovid that she was leaving to join a youth group that had just formed ill the Galilee  --  a girls ' training farm that had recently been launched thanks toNo Time For Tears 105the determination of Dr. Ruth Levy , herself a member of the second Aliva . She conceived the idea of a farm where girls would be taught , in addition to domestic science , market-gardening , poultry breeding and dairy farming . With Dvora 's announcement Chavala 's world did seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . She knew her reasons were selfish , but she 'd already lost Sheine and now clung tenaciouslyto at least try to keep her family together . Dvora , knowing Dovid would understand , told him , " Dovid , you must help me make Chavala understand I 'm no longer a child . This means a great deal to me . . . everything , really . Zichron is fine for Chavala , but I 'm not her . " " Let her go , " Dovid told his wife . " It 's right . To deprive her would only make her miserable , and eventually you too . " " We 're gradually losing them , are n't we , Dovid ? First Sheine , now Dvora ... " " They 've grown up , Chavala . Give her your blessings so that she wo n't need to feel any guilt . " Chavala did , but the day that Dvora left , Chavala felt as though she had lost a piece of herself . DVORA fitted immediately into life in the Galilee . In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and leave quietly while the others slept so that she could see the sunrise . She inhaled the perfume of the morning air , watched , felt nature all around her . The earth beneath her feet would soon , she felt , reveal all its secrets . She looked up to see the birds in flight . And with it all ... there was a dream that lay dormant in her , a dream that would soon be awakened ... . Three years before , a group called Haikkar Hatzair , " The Young Farmer , " had been formed in the United States by twelve young students from the Jewish agricultural college in Woodbine , New Jersey , who were preparing to live on the land in Palestine . After leaving college each member of the group acquired practical experience in a specific branch of farming , anticipating the system that was later adopted by the chalutzim . With $5,000 they appealed to the Palestine Land Development Company to take over the farm , complete with livestock and equipment , for one year . The two youth settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other was in need of a piece of equipment they readily shared .. . Cynthia Freeman 106Dvora had just come out of the milking shed when she saw off in the distance a young man carrying a small incubator . Looking in her direction he called out , " Shalom . " " Shalom . " As the two came closer Dvora felt a sensation new to her but ancient to females her age and older . . . Now face to face with the young chalutz , the feeling was both frightening and exhilarating at the same time . Feelingpeculiar , she averted her eyes when he said " I 'm from Haikkar Hatzair and I 've come to deliver this . Incidentally , my name is Ari Ben-Levi . " " And mine is Dvora Rabinsky , " she said so quietly he barely caught it . As the two proceeded on to the main building Ari said , " How long have you been here ? " " For a month now . And you ? " " I arrived three days ago from America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . " " I did n't mean it that way . . . you wo n't laugh if I tell you some-thing ? " " I promise . " " I was just thinking of my sister , who 's always wanted to go to America and here you 've come to Eretz Yisroel . . . I do n't think this is making any sense . " She laughed nervously . " Makes a lot of sense . My family escaped the ghettos of Poland and Ji could n't understand my giving up the good life to come here and work . It just shows how the pendulum swings . " " Your Hebrew is so perfect , I thought you were born here . I 'm afraid mine still has a Yiddish accent . Is your name really Ari Ben-Levi ? " " I was born Richard Levi . Not bad , one generation removed from the ghetto . But it is n't Richard Levi any longer , it 's Richard Lee . That 's what you call becoming Americanized . . . Well , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been very nice meeting you , Dvora ... " For the rest of that day she thought of Ari Ben-Levi and absolutely nothing else . Except that she might die if he did n't come back soon . Very soon . On Sunday he did . Looking up from her milking stool , she saw him framed in the doorway . She could hear her heart beat , her palms were wet . He was more handsome than she 'd even remembered . " Shalom , " he said smiling and spreading his hands , " I guess I'rn what you call an aggressive American . I 'd like to sec you today ... " No Time For Tears 107Swallowing , she said , " I 'll be through in about an hour . " " No hurry . . . I 'll wait . " He waited , this aggressive American , a week before getting up the courage to come back , a week when his thoughts had been of Dvora and little else . She was absolutely the loveliest thing he 'd ever seen . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eyes a sort of amber . Her waist was slim , and her bosom just round enough to excite him . If there was such a thing , Ari felt this was love at first sight . And what a sight .. . WHEN her chores were done Dvora slipped into a pair of fresh white shorts and pulled the blue cotton knit top over her head , buckled her sandals and glanced at herself in the mirror . Her face was flushed in spite of the tan . She ran a comb through her hair and was out the door of the small bungalow she shared with three other chaveroth . At first they just stood awkwardly , then Ari managed , " Since you know your way around better than I , what do you suggest ? " " Let 's hike to the top of the hill , the view from there is great . " When they got to the top and looked about , there was a stillness that seemed to make them feel closer . . . as though they were the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the snow-topped peak of Mount Hermon . Pink and white clouds floated languidly in the blue sky , and below could be seen the Sea of Galilee . It looked even lovelier today , standing here with Ari , than the first time she 'd seen it , when Dovid had said , " Come , Dvora , I want you to see this and remember it all your life . " She would remember it , and she would remember more this moment . Neither spoke . There was no need for words . They sat down under carob trees , and Dvora unpacked the small lunch she 'd brought with her . After they 'd eaten they lay back and looked up at the sky visible in patches through the branches . Slowly Ari 's hand found hers , and in the silence of that lazy afternoon he said , " I love you , Dvora . It happened the moment I saw you . I mean it , I do n't care how sudden it seems ... " " I believe you , Ari . Especially since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward , not even hesitant , as he turned to embrace her and their lips met . For them it was more than a kiss , it was a lifetime pledge . As enduring for them as this land they 'd both dedicated their lives to . Cynthia Freeman 108Chapter NineB y 1914 IT was a far different Palestine than the one Chavala and Dovid had first come to . The Jews now numbered some eighty-five thousand . The old Yishuv who had been in the country before the Zionist immigrationwas still concentrated in the four holy cities and still lived largely on contributions from abroad . They were alien to the new life that was evolving in Palestine and looked on it with a combination of apathy and even hostility . Their opposition was partly based on religious grounds , but even more on the fear that the funds from abroad would be increasingly for building up modern settlements , thus causing their own sources of income to dry up . The influence of the new worker settlements hardly touched Jerusalem and Hebron . The workers mostly found employment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economic center , and the Jewish population of Haifa and Jaffa owed its development to economic forces rather than to historical or religious associations . The opening up of new shipping , the laying of railroad lines between Jaffa and Jerusalem and Haifa quickened the economic pulse . Jaffa was the principal port of Palestine as well as the center of Judean settlements . Jaffa also became the cultural center of the Yishuv . The first Hebrew schools were opened in Jaffa , the Zionist institutions and workers ' federations had their offices there , topped off by the building of the first Jewish city  --  Tel Aviv . The former settlements were now replaced with kibbutzim that were gradually becoming the backbone of the Yishuv . At the outbreak of the First World War the Yishuv was numerically stronger and better organized than at the beginning of the Zionist settlements . It had advanced enormously since the unity of the working-class parties . Federations of agricultural workers were formed in Judea and Galilee , and were administered by an elected body , the Merkaz Chaklai . But for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews in the Diaspora . Turkey did n't enter the war immediately , but her pro-German leaningswere all too apparent . It was to be only a matter of time . . . A state of emergency was proclaimed throughout the Ottoman Empire and generalmobilization began to protect Turkish " neutrality . " Turkish shipping in the Black Sea and the Aegean was stopped . The Bosphorus and Dardanelleswere closed to foreign vessels . Egypt declared war against ( : erNoTime For Tears 109many and went under British protection , whose ships no longer could use Palestinian ports . In September foreigners came under the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts . They also lost postal facilities , so their correspondence was likely to be tampered with . And so the immigrant Jews in Palestine were cut off from their countries they 'd emigrated from . While the old Yishuv , divided as it had been before into factions and communities , stood by helplessly the new Yishuv was aroused . Its center was in Tel Aviv . Only a few days after the war began an emergency committee was set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with hardship , the Jews would have gone under if it had n't been for help from America . The American warship North Carolina put into Jaffa with $50,000 . Later on , other American ships entered Palestinian waters . This evidence of America 's interest in the fate of the Yishuv not only showed the Jews that they had a friend , it also raised their standing in the eyes of the non-Jewish population and the local Turkish authorities . People with rich friends in America were people who might be worth a little extortion . On orders of the American donors a central committee was set up to supervise the distribution of the relief funds . Palestine was divided into regions  --  Jerusalem , Haifa , Galilee , Samaria and Judea . The American Zionist Organization decided what the funds were to be used for . All this American aid was especially timely when on October 31 , 1914 , Turkey entered the war and the call went out to the Islamic world to join in a holy war against the Allies . Unprecedented hardships now began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake . Turkey at first ordered all enemy nationals transferred from Palestine to the interior of the Ottoman Empire . Thanks to the American and German ambassadors , though , Jews were at least allowed to opt for Turkish nationality and stay in Palestine . Those who did n't had to leave the country . The Jews were n't happy with the alternatives , but the salvation of the Yishuv depended on it . As for military service , Christians could buy exemption , but the Jews had to serve , and many of them were drafted into labor battalions , where they died of disease or starvation . Jamal Pasha , commander of the Fourth Army Corps , was appointed supreme governor of Syria and Arabia , and he had a fitting lieutenant in the person of the Baba al-Din , who had gained practical experience in the art of destroying whole groups of minorities in Armenia . The Zionists and Jewish national institutions were considered by Jamal Pasha and his minionsas Turkey 's real enemy . The first steps taken against them in OctoberCynthia Freeman 1101914 were such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all inscriptions had to be in Turkish and Arabic , beneath which Hebrew might appear only in small lettering . Tel Aviv was surrounded by troops . Searches were conducted in the homes of the leading Zionists , many of their papers were confiscated , presumably to expose the separatist aims of Zionism . A number of Zionists were arrested and sentenced to deportation , the use and possession of JNF stamps were punishable by death . Jews were not allowed to protect Jewish suburbs and the Judean settlements . The Hebrew language and the Hebrew script in correspondence were prohibited . The Zionist flag and Jewish administrative institutions were declared illegal . Transfers of land to Jews were forbidden , and the authoritiestried to gain possession of the title deeds to land already in Jewish hands . At noon on December 17 , 1914 , Baba al-Din issued an order that all foreign nationals had to leave , that a ship was due to lay anchor at Jaffa at four o'clock the same afternoon . Soldiers and police seized Jews  --  men and women , old people and children  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening they were hustled to the quayside and put into boats , which were to take them out to the ship . Husbands were separated from wives , parents from children . Trials began , indicting prominent Zionists , among them Yitzchak Ben-Zvi and David Ben-Gurion , both by now high in the labor movement . Ben-Zvi 's punishment was hard labor for an article describing the brutality used during the deportations . Ben-Gurion was accused of being subversive ... " It is your aim to establish a Jewish state in Palestine . I decree that you will leave the country . . . meanwhile you will be imprisoned . " At first Galilee suffered less than Judea ; but not for long . Requisitioningwas intensified . Draft animals , farm implements and stores of grain were seized for the army . The settlements were forced to supply men , horses and carts for work on military installations at Beersheba , and many died from diseases contracted as a result of back-breaking work under miserable conditions ... . Dovid 's situation was somewhat special . Working at Athlit had its advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relationshipgrew very strong , Dovid had shown great promise and his efforts had not gone unrewarded . Since Aaron had worked closely with the Turkish government on farm problems and had become a scientist of such renown , the pasha almost forgot  --  never forgave  --  that he was a Jew . He was able to intercede with the pasha on Dovid 's behalf , reminding the pasha that the men at Athlit were more valuable to the government with theirNo Time For Tears 111knowledge of farming than in clearing the roads . The pasha went along , not out of charity but because Turkey badly needed food to feed an army . Moishe 's position was more complicated . In spite of his hatred for the Turkish government he had no choice but to join up or be deported , and so he kissed his sister Chavala good-bye and said he would go back to Jaffa to wait for his orders . When he arrived in Jaffa , Moishe suddenly found himself caught up in the storm of arrests . Jews were being pushed and hurried along the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , none of whom was more bewildered than he . Moishe was on the road between Haifa and Jaffa as Baba al-Din was issuing his expulsion orders . He found old men , gray-bearded , with long coats and broad-brimmed hats , carrying all they possessed in their arms . The crowd was growing in size , as well as the outcries . . . " What have we done ? " . . . " Why are you doing this to us ? " . . . " Where are they sending us , we 'll die in the desert " ... When the group of displaced Jews was thrown into the detention hall , the rooms were already bulging with people . Families were being separated . . . " Where are you , Isaac ? " ... " My baby , God , where is my baby ? " .. . Moishe could no longer hold in his rage . " I demand to see your commander . " The answer was the butt of a rifle at his head . Moishe staggered , his hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head clear , he called out again , " I came to join the army  --  " The soldier laughed . " In Russia , you join . " People were thrown into a room and demands were made that they turn over their money . After all their possessions were stripped from them , they were herded to the docks and amidst all the madness , walked up a gangplank onto an unfit ship that was set adrift to find its way back to Russia . As he lay on deck , Moishe made up his mind that he would not go back , he 'd rather die . . . Now he became aware of the chalutz next to him . They looked at each other , and in that moment with no need to speak , each seemed to read the thought of the other . " Can you swim ? " whispered the stranger . " No . But if you have a plan , I 'll learn quick . " " I have a compass , I know where we might be able to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Cairo . . . I understand Trumpeldor is trying to convince the British that Jews can fight . " " I do n't give a damn about the British , they 're no better than the Turks , but hack to Russia I 'm not going . " Cynthia Freeman 112 " Good . At midnight we jump . . . incidentally , my name is Nathan Zalman . " The two shook hands . " If we do n't make it , our names wo n't matter , but just in case , I 'm Moishe Rabinsky . " Moishe , who had never swum , jumped and was surprised to find that he 'd somehow come up to the surface of the water . For a while he paddled . His pace was slower than Nathan 's , but his determination urged him on until he was almost side-by-side with his new found comrade .. . When at last they hit the beach , the two lay back in complete exhaustion and disbelief . If they could accomplish this , they 'd live to see the Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . Dovid 's attempts to quiet her fears did no good . She sat up until dawn , convinced something dreadful had happened . When Dovid awoke in the morning he found Chavala standing at the window . He put his arms around her and said , " We have to assume the best , not the worst , darling . Moishe is strong , he 's  --  " " I 'm not a child , Dovid . You know as well as I that something must have happened . He has n't taken his things , he was coming back after he joined up . What are we going to do ? " " Aaronson has connections . If anyone can find out he can .... Chavala waited , her anxiety growing . Finally on the third day , when Dovid came home , she was sure the worst had been confirmed . She saw it in the look on Dovid 's face . Moishe was dead . Taking her into his arms , Dovid said , " Moishe 's in Alexandria with Trumpeldor . Aaronson received this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's in Alexandria ... " Tears streaming down her cheeks , she looked at Dovid . " He 's safe ... thank God , he 's safe . " Yes , Dovid thought , but for how long ? CHAVALA 'S world , that only a short time before had seemed so safe and serene , now was unraveling . Sheine had been called up to work at the front near the Syrian border in a hospital unit . Moishe was alive , but for how long . . . ? Maybe he was n't considered a soldier , but the mule corps faced death as much as any combat unit . And now I ) vora had come hack to ' /ichron to announce she was going to marry Ari . No Time For Tears 113Thinking back on that all too short respite she 'd known living in Zichron , she now saw how presumptuous it was to think one was in control of her life , let alone the lives of loved ones . So Dvora was getting married . . . looking at her sister , Chavala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her sisters to marry , she would sew their wedding gowns and she and Dovid would walk each in their turn to the chuppah . . . now that dream was shattered , no amount of argument could convince Dvora . " Wait until the war is over , please , Dvora . I pray Ari willcome back . . . but darling , if the worst should happen . . " Then I 'll have his child . " Of course . . . Dvora was a woman , and Chavala had n't even noticed . " Are you carrying his child . . . ? " " Yes , and I 'm proud of it . I love him , Chavala , just as you do Dovid ... and whatever happens , I 'll have to accept it . " Chavala nodded . " When will you be married ? " " Immediately . " After Dvora left , Chavala sat in the lengthening shadows and began to come out of herself , to see in fact that she suffered from a very serious disease  --  self-pity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them far worse than hers , and she thought of Sarah Aaronson .. . Only God knew how Sarah must have suffered when she gave up the man she so deeply loved to her sister Rivka . ( The connection with herself and Dovid and Sheine did not . . . not surprisingly . . . occur to her . ) Sarah was a woman of great beauty and strength of character , filled with the joy of living and had always been ready for adventure . But Rivka was different , perhaps the opposite . . . she was always the adored little sister , sweet , piquant and vulnerable . Living as she did on the periphery of such forceful people as Sarah , Alex and Aaron , she developed a sense of inferiority , which Sarah not only understood but blamed herself for . . . Rivka seemed to have been all but overlooked . She may have been much adored , but still she could not compete with them . Although she had received numerousproposals , she had rejected them out of her mistaken sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one standing in Rivka 's way . Her sister 's love for Absalom was so intense , so complete that there was no question that she would ever marry anybody else . Sarah had seen them together , seen the way Rivka not only looked at Absalom , but how she looked up at him . And she was n't wrong . The man was unique , marvelous . After , all , she had fallen in love with him , had n't she ? Well , no more thinking about that . . . what she had to decide was whether she was strong enough to give up this man for her sister 's happiness , her life , Cynthia Freeman 114really . . . a life that had been too often limited and frustrated , Sarah felt , because of her own actions , as well as those of others in her family . She thought , and shook her head at the irony of the coincidence , about Aaron and how he was now alone because of a woman he could n't have , a woman married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny himself for somebody else . . . could she do as much for her own sister ? Somehow she had to , but how could she stand it ? For a while she considered going off someplace so that Rivka would be free to enjoy her love for Absalom , a love she 'd been hiding too long . But that would be too cowardly , and Sarah was no coward . What then ? The best she could come up with was a campaign . . . she shuddered when she considered it . . . to make Absalom grow tired of her . She began when he asked her to marry him , with a rather languid , " Let 's not be impetuous . " Absalom was n't a man easily put off , not by Turks or shortsightedJews who could n't see their future was to have their own land ... or by the woman that he had made up his mind to spend his life with . What the hell did she mean ? Why the sudden change ? Being less than self-assured when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 'd found or preferred someone else . He asked her . Sarah took the opening to concoct a story that she hoped was more convincing than , God knew , she felt . . . " Absalom , please try and forgive me . I did love you , but more and more lately I 've come to see that we are just too much alike , that marriage would only intensify that , and eventually we 'd both be miserable  --  " He was stunned , even though she seemed to be saying what he was most afraid of . " So you 've found someone else ? " " Yes , but please , try to remember the good things we 've shared . I know I always will . " Wonderful , he thought . Live on memories . To hell with that . Hurt , angry , he left , and his visits to the Aaronson home ended . Naturally , Sarah 's family was bewildered . Sarah tried to explain it to her father by saying love was n't enough , that she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absalom would never settle down , he was a free spirit , a fine man but eventually his way of life would make life impossible between them , and so forth . She was almost getting to believe , it herself , as she became increasingly practiced in her lie . Ephraim was miserable . Aaron had been forced into a life of loneliness , and now Sarah .. . " You 're sure , Sarah , that you wo n't regret this ? " No Time For Tears 115She could only shake her head , not trusting herself to speak anymore . Well , there could be no average man for Sarah , and where would Ephraim find another such man ? One to take Absalom 's place ? He did n't really find another Absalom , but he did find a man , a young man of great wealth , a merchant from Constantinople . Sarah amazed him by agreeing to marriage even though she had n't even seen the man . Sarah was quickly married and left immediately after for her new home in Constantinople . That summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Sarah had said to Absalom about being strong and independent was irrelevant only with Absalom . For this man it was like a sentence . . . she 'd grown up an independent-minded woman in the free atmosphere of Zichron . Here she was subjected to the world of an Oriental-stylemenage , where a husband 's regard for his wife was at his convenience and according to his needs . Actually he was very fond of Sarah , but he was raised in the conventional , rigid , old-fashioned German attitudes his family had brought with them from Berlin . Sarah was never allowed , as his wife , to leave their home alone . She was sheltered , sequestered . Well , it was a kind of atonement , she told herself , for all that she 'd denied Rivka in the past . At least the ledger was in balance . She hoped Rivka and Absalom  --  oh , stop it , she told herself . She was n't that noble . She 'd done what she thought she had to do . But she was no saint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other woman who had lost her man .. . IT was the perfect time for Rivka to come to him , to help get him through his bad times . She provided a sweetness , a serenity that he seemed to need so much after the tempestuous courtship and breakup with Sarah . Rivka was like a healing balm . To no one 's surprise , they were soon married . Like Sarah , Absalom tried hard to make his marriage work , but he still loved Sarah . Rivka knew when she married him that he did n't love her but like a few million women before her , she let herself hope that with time he might . It did n't happen . It was obvious to everyone that there was no longer enough even to make a show , and Ephraim now understood that Sarah had sacrificed herself , a sacrifice that defeated itself . He felt only pity forCynthia Freeman 116the suffering of the people involved , and blamed no one . But as he watched Rivka , now so pitifully silent , he knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to America , where hopefully she would forget Absalom and find something new and better with relatives in San Francisco . SARAH 'S letters went straight to Absalom 's heart . Beloved Absalom , not a day goes by that I do n't think about my arrogant selflessness . Not only did I destroy what we had , I made things even worse for Rivka . Let 's hope that America can make some of it up to her .. . And Absalom wrote .. . Your goodness , dear Sarah , is as great as your courage . You must not go on berating yourself . It 's true , a part of me went with you when you went away . I was hurt , angry . But we two are together even if we 're apart . The love between us is n't bounded by geography or time . I admit I 'm tempted to come to you , but that would never work . You 're married , and I have things to do that might keep us more apart than we are now . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from morning until the day 's end , and that is how it will be all the rest of my life . Chapter TenMOISHE AND NATHAN Zalman were picked up on the beach by a British patrol and thrown into a truck . Where they were going , they could only guess , but it would n't surprise them if they were hanged as spies . Without papers , how could they plead their case ? Passing the harbor at Alexandria , Moishe was overwhelmed by a sight that momentarily pushed aside his fears . Anchored in the harbor was a part of the giant British armada , the dreadnaught Queen Elizabeth , No Time For Tears 117looking as regal as its namesake . The Russian cruiser Askold was on hand with its five slim funnels silhouetted against the blue Egyptian skyline . There were French battleships , cruisers , destroyers , transports and smaller craft . Too bad they had n't come to deliver his people out of bondage , take up the challenge to free Palestine . The reality was that they were in the company of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Jews could save themselves . Including these two particular Jews . When they were finally delivered to the refugee compound of Mafruza , Moishe was shocked to see the compound overflowing with young Jews , who were undoubtedly contemplating their fate as he was . And like Moishe , they were unaware that their fate lay in the hands of men whose names they had never heard of , although they soon would .. . VLADIMIR Jabotinsky was considered a genius at seventeen . His prose and philosophies were being read in a land that had created Tolstoy , Gorky and Dostoevsky . He was a born linguist who had translated Shakespeareinto Russian , and War and Peace into English . By the time he was thirty his name was in the Russian encyclopedia . If he 'd been a Russian his life would have been far different , but he was a Jew , and so it was his lot to be hated and discriminated against . His intellect and talents might be rare , but the misery of his people was felt deeply and shared with the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle that forced him to reexamine his own position . . . did he live as a Russian , isolated from his people , or as a Jew ? There was only one answer after he 'd witnessed the Kishinev pogroms of 1903 . Jabotinsky rejected the doctrinaire , revolutionary approach of the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia . Instead he went into the ghetto to explore its heart , to understand its hurts , to learn its language . He became an outspoken Zionist , a convert to Herzl and his dream of a Jewish state . He visited the headquarters of the World Zionist Organization scattered throughout Europe , then left for France in the summer of 1914 . One evening as he walked the streets of Paris , he paused at the square where Dreyfus had been accused of treason , and Theodore Herzl had stood that same day in the drenching rain and heard the terrible cry , " Kill the Jews . " Jabotinsky was aware of the echoes of that cry , an echo that gave him his strongest sense yet of linkage with his people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to the German army and the Ottoman 14 , mpire declared war on the Allies , Cynthia Freeman 118Jabotinsky felt that after four hundred long years of tyranny , the Turks had taken the final step toward their own demise . That would only be good for the Jews . Now he saw his way clearly . Herzl had tried diplomacy , and for all his valor , had failed . Rothschild 's philanthropy had fallen short , and the Jewish revolutionaries of Russia had failed . Now with the Ottoman Empireabout to collapse , Jabotinsky knew Jews had to take a direct and active part in the fight for their liberation and destiny . The days of counting on foreign friends and doctrines were over . An all-Jewish military unit was at hand . The Jews would fight on the side of the Allies . And that road would lead to Palestine . That very night he packed and left for Egypt . In Alexandria , in the refugee camp , Mafruza , Jabotinsky found theeat Russian-Jewish officer , Joseph Trumpeldor . When Jabotinsky saw t'le one-armed Trumpeldor seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anger at the British for showing the man so little respect . Britain and Russia were , after all , allies , and this extraordinary officer had risen to heights in the Russian army that no other Jew had ever managed . Jabotinsky thought back to Joseph Trumpeldor 's beginnings .. . Unlike Jabotinsky , whose family was affluent , Trumpeldor had come from humble beginnings . His father had served in the army for twenty-five years as a conscript under Czar Nicholas I. As a Jew Trumpeldor was n't able to attend a university . He apprenticed himself to a dentist . When the war between Russia and japan broke out he was drafted into the army and sent to Port Arthur , Manchuria . For his sacrifice and bravery during the year-long siege he was decorated with the Order of St. George , the highest honor bestowed on any officer . After the war he had a reserve officer 's rank , which finally entitled him to attend the university and finish his earlier studies in the law . Still , in spite of the honors , Trumpeldor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left and went to Palestine , where he worked tilling the soil . And with the deportation of the Jews , he went into action . He knew what would happen to these Jews if they were sent back to Russia . And if they got to Egypt alive , Consul Petrov there would demand the deportation of all Palestinian males . Trumpeldor decided to try his persuasive powers on Petrov . He would go to Alexandria as one of the first expatriates . By the time his ship landed in Alexandria'I'rurnpeldor had gathered around him a group of young Jewish disciples who would follow him to the ends of the earth ... . No Time For Tears 119Now Trumpeldor sat at the makeshift table writing out the plans for his Jewish army that he intended to present to the British . They would have to recognize the huge stake that Jews had in this war . A Jewish legion would be the most dedicated , loyal and effective unit the Allies could possibly have . Men fired by a dream long denied them would fight to the death .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up and saw Jabotinsky framed in the doorway . No introduction was needed , Trumpeldorrecognized the famous journalist and author from pictures he 'd seen . Extending his hand , he said , " I 'm not surprised you 've come . If you were ever needed , it 's here . They say the word is mightier than the sword  --  " " Only in certain cases . Maybe Zola 's , where Dreyfus was concerned , " Jabotinsky said , " but for our cause only an army will do . " From that moment on these two were locked together by a common bond ; their goals were identical . After dinner they went to Jabotinsky 's hotel and Jabotinsky read the memorandum Trumpeldor had prepared to present to the British high command . " None of this , I take it , has been discussed with the British ? " " No . But before anything can be presented , obviously it must be translated into English , and that , my friend , is where you come in . " " I 'm more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we could present the British with a regiment of volunteers , then we might stand a real chance of the proposal 's success . How many men do you think could be raised ? " At the moment , Trumpeldor told him , there were two hundred able-bodied men , and each day new refugees were swelling the ranks . They had fled Palestine on anything that would move on water , and one thing they could depend on was that the Turks would expel more . If the Egyptian Jews could be brought out of their lethargy there would be a possibility of at least a few thousand . A regiment would be guaranteed . Jabotinsky nodded . " You 're right , but we still have to convince these Egyptian Jews that Palestine is more important than Cairo . These Jews , who were once slaves for the pharaoh , now employ Egyptian servants . The pendulum has swung . I do n't mean to suggest that Egyptian Jews are n't with us , but they have n't lived under the Turks , and the British are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small part of the Jews in Egypt . The rank and file are starving and would jump at the chance to earn their bed and board and have daily rations . I 've seen them hungry , roaming the streets of Alexandria . " Cynthia Freeman 120 " I know , but the power of the Jewish community here are the rich , influential Sephardim . Whatever action we take must include them . We 'll have to cultivate their friendship . " The name Vladimir Jabotinsky opened the right doors , and he brought Trumpeldor . The ladies were fascinated by the one-armed hero . They would certainly use their influence in the right places to help him recruit the young Egyptian Jews . The Sephardic leaders were convinced by Jabotinsky 's passionate oratory that Britain must accept the demands for a Jewish fighting legion on the Palestinian front for the liberation of Eretz Yisroel , and pledged their support . Now Trumpeldor was ready to confront the British officials . When he appeared  --  tall , broad-shouldered , lean , with the breeding of an officer and the dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't fail to impress Ronald Graham , Minister of the Interior for Egypt . He promised to do all he could . While waiting for a reply Trumpeldor opened a recruiting office . Names were written in Hebrew , Yiddish and Russian . In London , General Sir John Maxwell paced the floor of his stately office with a petition rattling in his hands . They were daft , those bloody Jews , thinking they could choose the war that they wanted . How dare they even propose such an outlandish thing . There had been nothing about an offensive against Palestine . The British were n't in this thing to gain a piece of real estate for the Jews . What ineffable cheek even to suggest that they could become full partners in the British army . He poured himself a brandy , sat down , sipped it . Still . . . there might be a use for these Jews , even if they were such a bothersome lot . Not as soldiers of the realm , of course , but as , say , attendant Billies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In India , in the Sudan , natives were used and had been bloody helpful . He recalled nostalgically how in the Boer War his own personal valet had accompanied him , bringing along his tailored uniforms and sterling silver brushes . That had been a gentlemen 's war . Of course all wars were different . There was a need for transport men . The terrain might be ... well , it might be rugged . getting up the hills at Gallipoli . So the general 's secretary got off a reply ... the volunteers would be welcomed into His Majesty 's Army in the capacity of a transport mule corps . This special unit would even bear arms . When Trumpeldor read the reply he tried and failed to swallow back the bile . They were n't going to allow a Jew the honor of fighting like a man . The young men around him had lived on this single hope , and in one month of training they had already proved themselves damned good soldiers . Now how the hell was he going to tell them ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave it to the British . They 've insulted us , slapped us in the face . Good God , Joseph , you 're not really going to accept this , are you ? " Trumpeldor shot back angrily . " What choice do we have ? Mules , transport troops , what does it matter ? The important thing is that Britain win , and when the Turks are driven out the men will forget that they were porters to haul water and ammunition . In battle all are the same . At least it will give the world a chance to see what Jews are made of . " When the men were told , their faces froze , the British were only using them , they 'd refuse to be treated like the animals they were supposedto lead into battle . Trumpeldor waited , then : " A soldier is a soldier , whether he carries a gun or leads a mule . In the army , all are the same . The important thing to remember is that this will be a Jewish unit with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting unit in eighteen hundred years . " He paused a moment . " Be proud , you are soldiers . Companydismissed . " Among those listening to Jabotinsky , and at first with skepticism , was Moishe , who had escaped the hangman 's noose only because of the progress Jabotinsky and especially Trumpeldor had made in getting some sort of status for the Jews in the military , even if it was only as a mule corps . Jews were , it was decided , at least a step up now from object lessons with the hangman 's hemp around their throats . The days waiting for this day had been ugly ones . . . the British were hardly more civilized than the Russians or Turks , though they spoke at times with impeccable accentsas they carried out their abuses . A British-run prison in Alexandria , land of the pharaohs , was a place of swill , despotic discipline and filth . All was scrubbed and shining , including the guards ' polished boots  --  you could see an emaciated Jew 's face in the toes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the spit . The sun , they said , never set on the British Empire . It also never rose for those within the gray walls of its prisons . The day they came to let out Moishe . . . he never did find his friend again . . . he thought surely it was his last . The gallows chitchat of the guards who prodded him with rifles hardly was calculated to disabusehim of such expectations . Driven in a truck like cattle , Moishe and others were taken to a primitive barracks , allowed their first bath in weeks , and then led out to hear this great leader . Imagine their surprise when instead of having a British accent he spoke as , and indeed was , a Jew , and an officer at that . Incredible . All right , so they 'd haul mules , but at least they 'd he Jewish mules ... since when had progress for Jews been in a hurry .. ? Cynthia Freeman 122When Trumpeldor returned to his barracks Jabotinsky was waiting for him . " Well , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but they 'll do their job . " " In that case I 'm leaving for London . You were right , sometimes the word can be mightier than the sword . I 'll use words to fight for an all-Jewish military unit with the same status that belongs to any British soldier .... " The next morning as Trumpeldor drilled nearly a thousand men of the Zion Mule Corps , a British officer watched them closely . This was a sight to see . Proud Jewish warriors , as proud to be Jews as he was to be Irish . Trumpeldor brought the men to a halt and attention , and with the aid of a regular army officer , who was to become interpreter , Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Patterson heard himself being introduced in Hebrew , Yiddish and Ladino . " I wish you men to know , " he said , " that I consider it an honor to have been assigned to your ranks . As I look among you I see the spirit that inspired your great general Bar-Kochba . That spirit has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your commanding officer , but only with the collaboration of Captain Trumpeldor . I am proud to be a part of you . " Patterson had led troops in Africa and India , and if a real soldier like him was honored to command a troop of muleteers , there was nothing to be ashamed of , they decided ... . Looking at these young men with the Star of David on their caps brought great pride to Trumpeldor and Patterson as they ordered the men out of the compound . It was time to prove themselves . In full uniform , packs on their backs , Moishe and his fellow corpsmenmarched through the streets of Alexandria . What a sight to see . The Star of David on their caps , they proudly held their ancient rifles against their shoulders . Small boys , both Jew and Egyptian , ran alongside and cheered . Jews cheered , young and old  --  and Moishe noticed more than one wiping a tear from his , or her , eye . Women and young girls threw flowers in their path . They stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbi in Sephardic Hebrew . The men had seven hundred and fifty mules . There were twenty horses for the officers . In addition to Trumpeldor , five British and eight Jewish officers had been appointed , the Jews with forty percent less pay , but at least the commands were given equally  --  in Hebrew as well as English . The mules , sorted according to size , were now being brought ontoNo Time For Tears 123the transport vessels , kicking savagely and braying  --  a strange contrast to the shrill Scottish bagpipes heard from another troopship . Then , accompanied by steamship whistles and commands from bleating horns , the men were brought aboard . Mules before men .. . Moishe had elbowed his way to stand at the railing and watch . As far as his eye could see , there were vessels . Clearly he was part of a huge operation , dwarfing the awesome vista he 'd observed in Alexandria Harbor that first day when he 'd arrived . Now he realized he 'd seen only a small part of the enormous armada that spanned the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April 17 , 1915 , the Zion Mule Corps sailed from Alexandria for Gallipoli under the escort of British warships . A distance away in the harbor , the band of the U.S.S. Tennessee , which happened to be in port , played a farewell march . And suddenly a song echoed over the sunlit Egyptian harbor , over the masts of fishing boats , over the stacks of ocean liners , over the towers and superstructures of the British men-of-war . It was a song of sorrow , dignity and surpassing hope too , destined to become the anthem of a nation to be reborn some thirty years later  --  the " Hatikvah . " The voyage to the Greek island Lemnos in the Aegean Sea , which was a springboard for the invasion of Gallipoli , took two days . The time was uneventful , but as soon as they entered the mouth of the Dardanelles the British let go with a massive burst of cannon fire . Moishe shuddered at the sound , put his hands over his ears , and thought about death . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to wonder just what sort of Jewish warrior he was . Maybe if he 'd been fighting for Palestine . . . but here he was on a ship that belonged to strangers , commanded by foreigners , headed for places where he would plod his mules in alien trenches . And even if the British won , there was no guarantee he would get back to his historic homeland . . . Moishe at that moment badly needed some convincinglink between his and Dovid 's dream of a homeland and the reality of his immediate situation . Well , Trumpeldor had said " Every road leads to Zion . " He held tight to that thought ... Zion was more than a word ... it was a purpose . He looked up and saw the streaks of red fire across the sky , and felt less afraid . It no longer mattered so much that the huge mountain which lay before him was not Mount Carmel . He understood better what Trumpeldor had meant about fighting for a country that annihilated his own people and for a czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought for was greater  --  and he fought not as a Russian , not for its cause , but fought for his own sake as a Jew , for all JewsCynthia Freeman 124 ... Trumpeldor had been right back in Alexandria when he told them to be proud , that they had to prove themselves , even as mule drivers . It was a major first step .. . After numerous foul-ups , there was a frenzy to reach Gallipoli on April 25 , the date set for the invasion . When they got close to the land , they found the enemy ready and waiting for them directly above the great fortification of Achi Baba . The British armada was choked . The strip was too narrow for all the transport vessels to approach and dig in . Still , the command was given and the men leapt into the water , and suddenly coming up to surface were hundreds of Senegalese , Australians , New Zealanders , Irish and Welsh and English clutching their rifles and struggling to wade to shore . Carnage lay all around them . Those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sea urchins . Bodies floated face down , many with their guns still clutched in their hands , never having had a chance to fire a shot . An order was given to reverse positions and at last a part of the beach had been secured . The men of Zion could have disembarked then , except there were no barges . From the rail , Patterson shouted down as the vessels passed , " You 've got to get me ashore , you bloody fools , I 've got your water . If you do n't help me get ashore you 'll not be dying from bullets but from thirst . . . " Not a craft slowed . Patterson took action . . . he simply requisitioned barges returning from the battle with the maimed and the wounded the moment they were emptied of the casualties . The dead and wounded no longer needed these barges , his muleteers did . Finally the men of Zion and their mules were able to disembark . The barges were tied together like a pontoon bridge that extended to the beachhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line across the planks and hurried them on . When the mules were led off , under constant bombardment , the mooring between the barges broke loose and the animals plunged into the water , taking their handlers with them . Moishe jumped back , grabbed a rope and held onto a frightened animal . Most of them ran helter-skelter , biting , kicking . The Turks were more predictable than the weather . A sudden storm with the ferocity of a typhoon came from out of nowhere . Crates , tins , ammunition boxes were flying like kites in the air , then came crashing down onto the beach . It persisted for two nights and days . The men huddled under any shelter they could find . When the storm broke , the mule corps was ordered by Trumpeldor to salvage whatever it could . N'Ioishc wondered what he had in mind ... how slid you make any kindNo Time For Tears 125of sense out of this chaos , tents blown away , the beach in total disarray . ... The work went on until dawn . When some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muddy earth and fell off into exhausted sleep ... . Moishe woke up dazed and disoriented . The pounding headache he had was ignored as he heard the urgent command that rations and ammunitionswere needed on V Beach . In the craziness he 'd all but forgotten that the mules had been led into a safe cove by Trumpeldor , between the rising and falling terrain under a cross fire that made him wonder how any of them were missed . Actually the casualties had been surprisingly few . In the days to come they were not so lucky . With the increasing action many of the men in Moishe 's squad were wounded . The bright sunlight helped make them targets . A shell would strike and the mules would scatter , dragging their handlers with them over rocks and falling debris . As the Irishman Lieutenant Colonel Patterson had privately anticipated , due to their pitiful lack of training , which was hardly their fault , and lack of communication , the Jewish muleteers and their British officers , full of old and well-tended prejudices , came more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops of the mule corps were actually sent back to Alexandria , which was of course a disgrace for them . Patterson 's Irish dander was not only up , it was over the top . During a confrontation in his tent with the commanding British officer he listened to the charge that the Jews had become insubordinate , refused to take orders , and so there was nothing for it but to return some of them to Alexandria and arrest and demobilize some others . Their mules were turned over to the Australians , " who were admittedly bloody barbarians but at least they spoke the language . " Patterson informed the officer that he was a damned fool , that one month 's training hardly added to seasoned troops . And , true , they did n't speak the king 's English , but they did n't unload ammunition boxes or control a bunch of crazy , frightened mules with their tongues . Even the mother tongue might have a bit of trouble with a goddamn mule under fire .. . When Patterson and Trumpeldor returned to Alexandria to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the British mistreatment of the mule corps . The men were never allowed to do anything but tote ammunition and supplies and live with mules , whether on a boat or on land . Clearly someone did n't approve of the Zion Mule Corps . When they got hack to Alexandria they were n't even allowed to go ashore to see their families and relatives . Yes , some of them did rebel then , and were promptly arrested . Their wives had never received support , their widowsCynthia Freeman 126denied pensions . The men were demanding they be soldiers , not just laborers , and be treated as soldiers . Patterson tried to get their status upgraded and was turned down by British headquarters . A group then went on a hunger strike . British soldiers proceeded to whip those considered the troublemakers , men accused of inciting the others to refuse to go back to Gallipoli . After their whipping they were tied to a wagon wheel for five hours and put on bread-and-water rations for three days . Trumpeldor could become angry over such treatment but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was n't entirely in sympathy with defying orders , knowing that any army had to have discipline . But these men were n't criminals . Things had gone too far . He tried to communicate his feelings to Patterson , and in the translation his words were so garbled as to provoke Patterson . . . " Damn it , Trumpeldor , " he said when they finally met , " I 'm no monster . I have as much feeling for those men as you do . But this is an army and we 're in a war . If anybody gets away with refusing to go back to Gallipoli it undermines the morale and discipline of the whole unit . . . " Again the translation was the worst enemy between the two . As he got it , Trumpeldor thought Patterson was holding him personally responsible for being soft on the men and encouraging them to be undisciplined . In the exchange that followed , Trumpeldor , through the interpreter , told Patterson he was n't going to be intimidated by threats , that if Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Patterson did just that . In the end Patterson sent for Trumpeldor , apologized and said he 'd had the same kind of trouble as an Irishman with the British . He still thought that sometimes Trumpeldor was a little too soft on his men , but he understood the reasons and respected his work . " I 'm asking you to stay and forget what 's happened ... " Trumpeldor had been waiting for these words and quickly agreed to come back . And when his troops heard he 'd been apologized to , they went back with him to Gallipoli . By now the fighting was even fiercer . The casualties increased among the mule corps . The Turks were surprisingly stubborn . Moishe , who had stuck it out this whole time , was a battlehardenedveteran compared to the returnees and new recruits from Alexandria . But this did him little good when , as he was unloading supplies , a shell exploded a few yards from him and he was promptly knocked unconscious in the mud . When he woke up , his head felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could not move his left kg , which had taken a chunk of shrapnel . No Time For Tears 127Well , at least he was alive , and his wound earned him a trip back to Alexandria with the other wounded . Meanwhile there were few rewards for the Jewish blood that had been and was being shed . The mismanaged Gallipoli campaign was coming to a close . In November Colonel Patterson became very ill , turned over his command to Trumpeldor and went back to Alexandria and then England . At the end of the month the blizzard came with blinding snow and bitter cold . The Jews carried on , delivered their loads and returned to base with their animals , often without coats or boots . As a reward , a month later an order came down to disband the corps . The peninsula was being evacuated . Before they embarked , as many as could went to say farewell to their brothers that they would leave behind on this foreign soil , their graves marked by wooden Stars of David . They chanted the Kaddish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like good soldiers , marched to the boat that would take them back to Alexandria just after the beginning of the new year of 1916 . It had been a military defeat , but still a victory of sorts for the Jews . They were , after all , accustomed to not winning . But at least they had made a major contribution to a fight that for them was only beginning ... the revival of a homeland . Yes , all roads still led to Zion , including the road of temporary defeat ... . CHAVALA 'S hand trembled as she held the envelope in her hand , then looked at the stamp . It had arrived by way of Switzerland . She hesitated before opening it , terrified about what the contents might be , then quickly tore it open . This was the first time she had heard directly from Moishe and now as she read , her tears were out of gratitude that he was at least alive . My dearest family : As you know , there was no way until now that I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of great concern to me . In fact , I pray that you will receive this . I want you to know that not a day has passed when you have not been in my thoughts . Even in battle it was your presence that kept me going . Please do n't laugh , dear Chavala , but it was not my determination to try to defeat the Turks but the wonderful smells of cooking that come from your kitchen that I fought for . I can scarcely wait to tasteCynthia Freeman 128your cakes and cookies . Even now your strudel and mandelbrot make my tastebuds water , and the carrot tzimmes draws me closer to home . As you know , the battle of Gallipoli is over . The British could have won there , but they really are such pompous fools . If we had had fifteen thousand men we could have conquered it . The trouble is , they do n't know about mountains as well as we do . Well , at least that 's over with . There is so much I want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way we used to do , but that time will come soon . I must believe that . I only pray everything is all right with you , and that all of you are safe . Trumpeldor advised us all to stay together , even though the muleteers have been disbanded . He is on his way to England because it seems that Jabotinsky is making headway with the British . Chaim Weizmann is helping , because now he too believes that we should have an all-Jewish military force . The bravery of the mule corps was evidently more impressive than we thought . The rumors are that any day we will be sent to London . If that happens I will have to forego your baked brisket and those crispy potato latkes that could melt in my mouth . By the way , I was slightly wounded in my left leg . Now please do n't start worrying , Chavala , it was just a little shrapnel so they sent me back to Alexandria . It was very minor and in fact I 've had a good rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're not only sweet but very pretty . There 's nothing like a pretty woman to help what ails you , especially one that seems to like me . But do n't worry , Chavala , I wo n't come home with a shiksa bride . Again , please take care of yourselves , and know how much I love you . Kiss little Reuven for me , and hold him so close that I will be able to feel his warmth . I love you all more than my words can say , Your brother , MoisheIt was good for Chavala that she would never know how Moishe felt as he sealed the letter she 'd just read , then moving clumsily off the bed , maneuvered himself into his wheelchair and rolled himself down the hall . No Time For Tears 129Chapter ElevenS PRING , 1916 . A plague of locusts . An opportunity for the Yishuv , but especially for the scientist  --  and secret Zionist  --  Aaron Aaronson . He traveled to the south to teach the Arab farm-owners and peasants how to combat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dovid Landau , as supervisor of the Galilee . The plague under control , Jamal Pasha , in his style , decided that the time was right to execute the elimination of the Yishuv . All nonresident Ottoman subjects , all Jews , were to depart Jaffa and settlements in its vicinity . The order to evacuate Jaffa and Tel Aviv remained in force even though the considerations of strategy that had prompted it had lapsed with the defeat of the British near Gaza . The evacuation of the Jews of Jaffa was merely the prelude to a new wave of persecution . Each day was beset with a new crisis . A blockade now surrounded the Mediterranean , stopping the Atlantic crossing of relief funds , gold and foodstuffs . Now they had to be sent by the American Zionist organization , JNF and other Zionist bodies in the form of bank drafts by way of Switzerland . But the Turkish authorities confiscated all the gold they could lay their hands on . In the absence of gold the market was flooded with Turkish paper money , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth of its normal value . The financial situation grew so threatening that the Yishuv was on the edge of ruin . The activists took over . Not enough to protect their settlements from Arab marauders and Bedouin murderers . Now they formed a political action committee . Buy arms and train young boys too young for army duty . The " Jaffa Group " began storing weapons in secret places and the training of youths was done out of sight of the Turkish eye on the kibbutzim . The Turks sensed the climate of insurrection . Yishuv members were taken into custody and viciously interrogated . Among those arrested were Dovid and Absalom . Absalom , still in a kind of mourning for the failure of his marriage with Rivka , but also , to be frank , relieved that she 'd gone off to America , took the challenge as a welcome focus for his energies and passions . I ) ovid , though also a man of scientific talent , as he 'd proved in his association with Aaron Aaronson in his work reviving the land andCynthia Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was famine and disease , had never given up or backed off from his determination that the Jews should have their homeland , that danger . . . and even death were concomitants of his dream  --  and that a dream was measurable after a while by how close it came to reality . He had personally smuggled weapons and kept them on the kibbutz . He had even been shot once and had to be secretly cared for and at the same time tried to calm Chavala and her fears at his actions and what they would mean to her and the family , to their little son Reuven and to Chia . . . " My God , Dovid , our family has already drifted away . One is no longer a Jew . Moishe has been wounded and we pray will fully recover from his service as a soldier . I know how much you have worked and risked for what you believe in . I respect it , even though I have other dreams , as you know . But , Dovid , you owe us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dovid had understood Chavala 's fears , but he was also driven by needs that went beyond them . When he and Absalom were arrested , driven like criminals by the gun muzzles of the pasha 's soldiers , they had no idea whether they would survive for a minute or an hour . If they would soon be hanging from the end of a rope . Their worries were n't empty or melodramatic ones . It was Aaron 's intercession with the pasha that kept them from the end of the rope , if not from the ugly indignities his soldiers in their sniggering fashion visited on them . At one point Dovid had ignored the threat of gun and rope , and swung around and smashed the face of the guard who had been obscenely taunting him . He was hardly surprised to receive the butt of a gun in his stomach , knocking him to the floor , followed by a knee to the groin  --  the guards were long experienced in the methods of inflicting punishment which did n't show on the outside , could kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , was about to call out , but realized that could only make it worse for Dovid and himself , and accomplish nothing . When Aaron went to Beirut to see the governor of the territory he was reasonably confident that bribery would at least insure that his friends would be decently fed and not abused . But as he handed over the gold coins to the governor he realized by the smug look on his face that this was only the beginning of the extortion . There was nothing for it but to go directly to jamal Pasha . In the pasha 's office Aaron came quickly to the issue . " You know that my men at Athlit have proved their loyalty to this government . I want this harassment to stop . Their contribution is too valuable to the war to have them spending their lives in jail . " No Time For Tears 131 " Not all of your people , Aaronson , but I grant you that you and others have proved of value . I had no idea , I assure you , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely the case  --  " and I give you my word the matter will be taken care of .... " It was at about this time that Dovid was waking up with a terrible knot in his stomach from the blow he 'd taken . His surprise , and Absalom 's , at the sudden appearance of the guards not to string them up but actually , amidst muttered curses and threats , to escort them out of the prison and to a hotel in Jaffa was beyond belief . At first they wondered if they were being taunted into believing that somehow they were saved and then the string would be pulled and the rope would replace it . The sadism of the Turks was not beyond such behavior . Only when food was served them did they decide even the Turks would not go to such lengths for abusive sport , and that their rescue , this time at least , was real . " You know , " Absalom said as he lay back on his bed , which was next to Dovid 's , " Aaron either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone over to the enemy , and I guess I better quickly say that I believe it 's the former that has gotten us out of this . " " Yes , " Dovid said , " and we need to take advantage of it , not just be grateful we 're not dead . Believe me , only because he thinks he needs us does the pasha hold off from having us banged . We ca n't go on forever trusting to that , even with Aaron 's influence . What if the locusts do n't come ? It seems we need a disaster to make us worth keeping alive ... " " I agree , let 's destroy them once and for all  --  " " What 's your plan ? " " Open rebellion . No more using the cover of the British army  --  " " No ... that would be suicide , and we Jews have done enough of that . That just about got you and me hanged . And for what . . . ? A few boxes of ammunition . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change ... " " Fine , what do you suggest ? " Absalom said , lowering his voice . " Espionage , " and now Dovid 's voice dropped to a near-whisper . " Espionage ? And you say open revolt would be suicide ... " " Absalom . . . we can supply vital information to the British , information they do n't have and could never get . They 'd listen  --  " " I do n't agree . The only thing they 'd listen to is a Jewish fighting force inside Palestine . " " Maybe , but I still say that would be suicide for us . I want to see the Turks with their throats cut , not ours . We both want the same thing , Absalom , it 's just a question of how best to get it . " Cynthia Freeman 132The tensions were broken between the two men when Aaron walked into the hotel room . Their greetings were brief , and it was n't until they 'd arrived back at Aaron 's house in Zichron that they spoke to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken form in the hotel room back in Jaffa . Without preamble , Absalom said , " The only way that we can speed up the liberation of Palestine is through rebellion ... " Aaron was shocked at the suggestion . He hardly had any love for the Turks , but the notion of insurrection seemed empty and wrong to him ... " No , Absalom , the British have the arms to liberate Palestine  --  " " It 's our national duty to organize on our own behalf . " " I supose I 'm more a scientist than a political activist . But you know my sympathies , and my usefulness . Open rebellion did n't get you and Dovid out of the hangman 's noose . " Absalom 's eyes flamed with anger . " You 're a scientist , Dovid is a believer in helping the British , who treated us like mules . I say to hell with both of you . Let me know when you think we 've had enough punishment , " and without further word he went out of the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awkward silence , both knowing that Absalom'sanger , while sincere , was also usually short-lived . Aaron said , " You must have had something to say to one another in that hotel room . I have a feeling , Dovid , that you 'd like to tell me what 's on your mind . " " You 're right , and I 'm not going to be diplomatic . Now , you may be a scientist who does n't want to get involved . . . and you 've said I 've some ability in that direction too . . . but whether you like it or not , you 're involved in this as much as Absalom or myself . Because of the position you hold within the Turkish government , you 're the key that 's going to open up doors for us , Aaron . Now , Absalom 's angry for good reason , and so am I. We differ only on means . We do n't want to wait for the British , on their own , to liberate us . What Absalom wants is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the best way for us would be to use our advantage and the British . . . gather information to speed up the British effort against our enemies . I do n't for a minute think the British are our friends . . . they use us and we tell ourselves our purposes are served . Well , if that 's so , let 's help them to use us even more  --  to get what we want . Let us control our destiny , by some manipulating of the British , for a change. , No Time For Tears 133Aaron shook his head . " Both of you seem to have got our salvation pretty well worked out for us . Well , I still refuse to become involved in either one of your plans . Now , if you do n't mind me saying so , I think it 's time for you to go back home to Chavala . " WHEN Chavala saw Dovid come through the front door , the profound anxiety she 'd felt in the last days was hardly lessened by what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Quietly she went to him and put her arms around him , " My darling Dovid , it must have been terrible . . . thank God you 're home . " " Yes , thank God , and Aaron . " There was something in the tone of Dovid 's voice that contradicted his words . He did n't sound grateful . What she caught in his voice was anger at both God and Aaron . . . well , tonight she would not question him . Quietly she said , " Dovid , come , let me get you something to eat . " The second greatest offering a woman could make , she thought wryly . At this moment it was n't food he needed to offset his frustration . " No , Chavala , I 'm really not hungry ... " " Then let me fix you a hot tub . " " That sounds very good . Thank you . " After the bath Dovid lay down , Chavala alongside him . But as she clung to him she still felt the tensions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been under , the things you went through in jail , but I also know there 's something more . . . what is it . . . ? " " It 's nothing . . . or maybe it 's everything . I do n't know , Chavala , I guess what I 'm trying to say is , maybe I would have felt better if I 'd joined the British in the fighting . Like Moishe did  --  " " Oh , Dovid , darling , everyone fights in his own way . You were wounded , for God 's sake . . . and look what Aaron has been able to accomplish ... " The muscles in Dovid 's jaw tightened . " He has pointed that out . But the fact is , while the Turks are destroying the whole Yishuv , we 're safe here at Zichron . " " Dovid , you 're all doing the best you can . The problems are huge ... you ca n't expect Aaron to be the Messiah . I 'm sure he 's doing what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chavala clung dose to her husband and knew that this was no time to argue with her husband . Cynthia Freeman 134Well , she was still a woman . She knew how to make that contribution . And she did . THE next week Dovid made the rounds of the settlements . The complaintswere no different than the ones he 'd heard ever since the war began . The Turks were requisitioning their wheat and animals , and what the Turks did n't take the Arabs stole . He journeyed north . The Jewish soldiers in the labor battalion were clearing the roads in the unrelenting heat of the noonday sun . Their lips were parched white from too little water . Because the work was going slowly , many wore cruel lash marks on their backs . Their faces bore the scars of brutality too . Those who dropped from exhaustion were chained to a tree and beaten . Dovid had seen these atrocities before and hated himself for not being able to stop them . This day , though , his anger was greater than ever before . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were abusing old men on their way to prayer . They taunted them by pulling at their earlocks and the fringes on their tallisim , which they wore under their black long coats . One old man who protested was thrown to the ground , kicked and left in the dust , hurt and bleeding . Dovid had to fight himself not to get both of them killed by going after the Turkish soldier . He literally willed himself to leave the scene , and rushed back to Zichron , where he went straightaway to see Aaron . Still full of anger , he repeated the atrocities he 'd seen . He told Aaron that if nothing was done the dissident groups would take it on themselves to take direct action , and that would put the whole Yishuv in more danger than it already was . Aaron knew the logic of that . He hated that Jews should become involved in espionage but at least it was better than Absalom 's suicidal notions of open revolt . . . " All right , call your meeting . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dovid , are going to have to assume the key position . " " I do n't mind , I welcome it . Besides , with your contacts with the Turks , it 's better you not risk yourself . " THE word went out , and the next evening , in great secrecy , the key men from Hashomcr , the Jaffa Group , the Gideonites and Athlit were contactedto meet in Aaron 's laboratory . No Time For Tears 13 5Dovid stood looking over the group . " Thank you all for coming . In the past we 've had our disagreements , but now we must bury them for the survival of our people . You know that what we are about to do is dangerous . To underestimate it would be foolhardy and dishonest . You must consider that you will be an enemy of the country , and if caught , you will be hanged . Those of you who have families should consider what that would mean to their safety . If any of you are undecided about this , the time to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men a brief time to think . But all were in agreement . . . their lives were in jeopardy in any event . Whatever the cost , drastic measures had to be taken . Dovid looked at Aaron who nodded in agreement , then Dovid went on . " It 's my belief that the kibbutzim as well as the Yishuv must know nothing about our activities , for their own good and ours . However , it 's a little different here in Zichron . The village obviously will be unaware of the activities that will take place , but key men working at Athlit should very gradually move their wives and children to a safer place . Any quick , mass relocation would cause suspicion . . . I now turn the meeting over to the assembly . " Each man began with his own plan . Yitzchak Lavinsky spoke for the Jaffa Group . " We could raise an army of three hundred men . Already trained and equipped with arms . Their mission would be to blow up Turkish installations  --  " " And that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprisals down on the whole Yishuv . As a Shomer my job is supposed to be to protect the Yishuv . " " So what do you want us to do , hire an army and fight the Turks in hand-to-hand combat ? " Asher Meged of the Gideonites answered back quickly . Absalom stood . " As a matter of fact , that 's more along the lines that I was thinking . However , mine is n't quite hand-to-hand combat . I suggest a joint operation with the British . Eventually they 'll have to move across the Sinai to take Palestine and Syria . If we Jews here help them , it could be done sooner . It would involve the Gideonites , the Jaffa Group and I iashomer . All would be mobilized at a strategic point and the coast would he seized and held . Our flag with the Star of David would be raised and war declared against the Ottoman Empire in the name of the Jewish State . Obviously this action would be coordinated with the arrival of the British fleet and the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan could n't fail ... the enemy would he driven out as they wereCynthia Freeman 136when they attacked the Suez . And the British would welcome this strategy since it would save them from coming north across the desert . " " And where on the coast could they possibly land , with the coast being patrolled as it is ? " said Moses Bartov , the Shomer from Galilee . " That 's just the point , " Absalom said . " Palestine will never be in a better position . Jamal Pasha sent the main army to Gallipoli , left only a token force here . A limited British unit could cut the Turkish army in half . While we hold the shore the British could land . Athlit covers the coast behind the ruins of Caesarea . A few hundred of your men could secure our position against an army of the size now in Palestine  --  " " It 's not that simple , " Aaron said , " If you 'll forgive a military opinionfrom a scientist . The shoals at Athlit and Caesarea would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The area between the shore and the landing area could never be taken . I just do n't think military action at this time would be advisable  --  " " So , " Moses Bartov said , " we sit back and let the Turks do to us what they did to the Armenians ? The pogroms we lived through were nothing compared to that . We lost a few hundred villages . But we survived . Compared to these barbarians the Russians were civilized . They rounded up every Armenian . They took people , town by town , hamlet by hamlet , house by house . Just to kill a few , you think ? No . . . to wipe out an entire people . Not a man , not a child was to be left . They took them into the forest , the women and children , and left them to die of starvation . They told the men they were going into the army "  --  Moses spat  --  " they took them to the army . . . to the army of death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of the world , and nothing was done to stop it . If nations can stand by and permit a whole people be slaughtered like sheep , then take my word , we are next . Jamal Pasha has made no secret that he wants only Turks wherever they rule , only their religion , only their language . . . Well , everyone has to die , but I 'll die like a man , not like an animal led to slaughter . I 'll die with a gun in my hand .. . I 'm for Absalom 's plan . " Moses sat down and knew he had moved the group . Aaron was affected too , but he had to remind them that brave words would n't solve the problem of rocks and shoals that prevented any large-scale landing . Aaron had put a damper on the men 's spirits . . . and then Dovid stood . " I 'd like to ask you a question , Aaron , since you 're the one who moves the most freely among the offices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well . . after the Turkish counterattack on the Suez collapsed , theNo Time For Tears 137Turks were beaten and they retreated into Palestine . I waited for the British to take advantage , to make a forward thrust . They did n't . Why do you suppose that was ? " Aaron knew very well the answer , and left it to Dovid to give it ... " I 'll tell you , Aaron . . . the British lacked an intelligence network in Palestine and Syria to tell them the situation in the enemy camp . I believe they know now that they lost the advantage when they were on the offensive in the Suez because of lack of intelligence inside Palestine and Syria . They 'd jump at the chance to work with us now . We know this country . They 'll accept our plan , Aaron . How can they afford not to ? We can offer the British a network of surveillance  --  " Nachman Shamir broke in . " You mean spying . . . why do n't you call it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to do in the meantime ? It could take months to gather the kind of information you 're talking about . " " You 're wrong . Every one of us has more information than the British have . The real problem is to keep things quiet enough so that we do n't put the Yishuv in danger . So , I 'm not asking you to twiddle your thumbs . We can do two things at one time . . . while we 're gathering information , you can acquire all the arms that you can and train as many men as possible . Take my word , those of you who want to take up arms so badly will have your opportunity . When the time is right . The Turks will lose , and if the British accept this proposal it will be sooner than you think . " In spite of his former reluctance to become involved , Aaron agreed . " Now , it 's very late and tomorrow night we meet again . " IT was four in the morning when Dovid returned home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake Chavala , but she was waiting . She lit the kerosene lamp and looked closely at him . " What was so important ? ... Something is going on , I know it , I feel it . You do n't usually discuss wheat and oats till four in the morning . " How was he going to tell her ? Not only that he was now a spy , but that he was also sending her away . " Dovid ? " He paused for a moment , then , " It 's late , it 's a long story , I do n't know where to begin  --  " " With the truth . " 1k told her as little as possible , but how could lie not tell her of hisCynthia Freeman 138own involvement ? He owed that to her . Telling her that she and the families of the other leaders would have to move out of Zichron was the most difficult job . Quietly , he tried to explain . . . there 'd be no departure en masse , they 'd leave on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . what you 're saying . . . You are going to be a spy for the British ? My God . . . what happens if you are caught ? " " You would n't be involved , that 's why the less you and the others know , the better . " " Involved ? " She laughed miserably . " I 'm your wife . . . I am involved . Dovid , you must get out of this before it 's too late  --  " " I ca n't do that , Chavala . . . You remember the night I came back from prison ? You know how I acted when you questioned me . . . well , I could n't really tell you what I thought because I had no one to support it . Now I do . . . you said that night that we all fought in our own ways . Well , this is my way , the only way . I devised this plan . I ask you to try to understand how important  --  " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish woman who can see no further than that her husband was spared . . . I 've no big visions , Dovid . I just want you to live . I want you ... I want to be with you . . . I wo n't be sent away  --  " " Please , Chavala , do n't make this more difficult than it already is  --  " " Sheine was right . . . I should have stood up to you , Dovid , insisted we go to America . . . God , it 's the only sane nation on earth , that 's why they are n't in this war ... " Dovid knew that for all her show of spirit Chavala was weeping inside . But he could n't back down . . . " But we are here , and nothing can change that except to try to end this horror as quickly as possible  --  " " And sending me away will bring peace faster ? " " No , but it will be safer  --  " " Dovid , please . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of them that you  --  " " No , Chavala . I 'm doing this for myself , I admit it , as much as for Zion . If I do n't , I 'll never be able to face my son , or live with myself . Or be worthy of you . " Dovid sat down on the edge of the bed , exhausted . Dawn had just broken , and Chavala looked out to the small backyard and saw the palm trees silhouetted against the Palestinian sky . Strange , she thought , the things people think of at moments like this . Dovid had planted those trees just before their son Reuven was born ... that wasNo Time For Tears 139nine years ago . They had borne the fruits of their labor . . . would Dovid live to see his seed grown to manhood ? Quietly now she asked , " Where will you take us ? " " To Jerusalem , into the Old City . No place is safe , but at least the Turks have left the shrines alone . " Chavala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in his lap . " What will I do without you ? " " And I without you ? In war families are apart ... " Chavala tried to remember the years they 'd lived here in Zichron ... such happy days , dancing and singing at the village threshing-floor on hot clear nights after the harvests . . . picnicking and swimming in the ancient harbors of Caesarea . She 'd watched Raizel going off with other young people to parties in other settlements . And Dvora racing ahead , laughing as her long hair billowed out against the mild wind . . . Now ... they were gone . . . nothing was left . . . nothing more to say , except ... " When will I go ? " " Later today . " He was grateful to her for making it easier than he 'd have thought possible . Easier for him , but he knew what was going on inside her , beyond the words . . . " Come , lie down next to me , I need to hold you ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though trying to deny the separation that was coming . WHEN Chavala and Dovid walked up the stone stairs to the old apartment in Jerusalem , they stood in the center of the room , neither quite knowing what to say . Dovid picked up his son and held him , looked at the soft brown eyes of the little boy and tried to remember all the good things ... How happy the child was when he would take him to Athlit . He loved the laboratory best . Dovid would adjust the lens of the microscope and Reuven would smile at the wonders of the world he discovered through it . " I 'm going to be a scientist like you , abba . When I grow up . . . " When he grew up ? What kind of a world would it be ? Dovid only hoped that what he was now doing would make it a safer , better place for his son to grow up in . And his son 's son . . . He turned to Raizel . He had n't realized how lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years had gone by so fast . He could rememberseeing her minutes after her birth , and now she was a young woman of almost twenty . Raizel was like her mother . Wise , yet shy . So giving ofCynthia Freeman 140herself , she had n't gone to the Galilee when she 'd so badly wanted to ... papa came first , and three times she 'd refused marriage because she felt in her heart that Chavala needed her more . . . it was as though she would make up for the pain of Sheine and the abruptness of Dvora 's marriage and going off . . . and ease the awful fear caused by Moishe 's absence at war , his being wounded . . . And little Chia , for whom he 'd built a shed for her goat , now she was already eleven . So much had happened to them in that short span of time . They 'd known death and hunger , love and joyous times , and now this war ... Chia clung tight to him , calling him abba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abba . " Taking her to him , he forced a smile . " I 'll be here so often you wo n't have time . " Chavala listened to the sweet deception , wishing it were true .. . Their parting was so painful no words could say what either one of them felt . Except deep down in Chavala was a fear she could not force out ... They were at the crossroad of their lives . Chapter TwelveTHANKS To xis great success in destroying the locusts , Aaron Aaronson had authority from Jamal Pasha to go anywhere he thought there was a need for his services . He and his designated associates from Athlit were allowed to go into even most restricted military areas . Aaron , as agreed , stayed as inconspicuous as possible . His prominence gave him access , but was also a more visible target . Further , if it became necessary to leave the country for any reason , it was important for Dovid and Absalom to be well-connected with Jamal Pasha to carry on in his confidence . Dovid and Absalom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Turk seemed to relate better to Dovid 's low-keyed manner than to Absalom 's extroverted tone . Not that the pasha disliked Absalom , but Aaron sensed that on those visits when the two had gone to Damascus , the pasha 's Oriental mind somehow resisted , even resented , Absalom 's sureness and jocular behavior . Since the pasha 's mood was more than receptive these days , due to tiw wheat production , AaronNo Time For Tears 141felt it was best for Dovid to go on this mission . And Dovid agreed . On the road to Damascus , Dovid closely observed the fortifications , the amounts of food supply for the soldiers and civilians , the size of the army and its disposition . Through contacts in the cities he was given the amount of war materiel coming into the country , how many army units were being deployed and the contact at Gilboa . He found out the approximatenumber of pilots as well as when they would make their flights . When he arrived in Damascus he went to the hotel and bathed and shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fresh aba and adjusted the white kaffiyeh on his head he looked at himself in the mirror and had to laugh . His thoughts went back to a little shtetl , to a young man sitting at a cobbler 's bench . . . now , dressed like Lawrence of Arabia , going to see one of the most influential officials in the Ottoman Empire . A long way since that morning they 'd walked from the little village to the port of Odessa , leading a goat and shlepping all kinds of bundles ... . As Dovid sat in jamal Pasha 's office waiting for him , his eyes wanderedto some papers on the desk . The temptation was near-overwhelming . He realized the consequences of what would happen should Jamal Pasha walk in . . . but did he dare risk it ? He 'd never have a moment like this . . . did he dare not risk it ? He got up and bent over the desk . God , this looked like a battle plan . . . amounts of food , sizes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second attack on Suez . . . too much to commit to memory . His heart pounded as he took out the black notebook he used to make his progress reports that he presented to Jamal Pasha . He wrote as fast as he could . He had finished , just put the notebook back into his pocket when the door opened and Pasha entered . His head pounded like it would split into pieces . Pasha was no fool , to underestimatehim would be a great mistake . He may have even left the plans as a test . . . nothing for it but to act innocent .. . Pasha looked at Dovid , then casually to the plans on his desk . It was too ridiculous . . . he 'd had this terrible need to relieve himself ever since that idiot wife had demanded he show her attention right there on his chaise in the office . . . that call of nature was responsible for his lack of prudence in leaving Landau alone with the plans . . . How loyal was Landau ? Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He had had access to many things and so far there had been no known leaks to the British . . . Still , Landau was a Jew . . . He searched Dovid 's face carefully for any sign of guilt , even unease . The face revealed nothing , but perhaps his voice would betray him . . . " Well , Landau "  --  lie smiled  --  Cynthia Freeman 142 " what do you think of the plan ? " A frontal move would , he decided , be most likely to unnerve a guilty mind . " I 'm an agronomist , not a military strategist , I really ca n't give an opinion , " Dovid said with  --  he hoped  --  disarming conviction . " You underestimate yourself . " Dovid smiled . " Thank you , but I do not underestimate our government . Look at the British fiasco in Gallipoli . They boasted that a few days and the whole battle would be over . The British lion left with his tail between his legs . And he 's not doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the run . We will win , I 've no doubt no doubt of it . " Jamal Pasha was pleased . " Well , for a scientist , you 're an astute military analyst , Landau . " " Not so astute , I just have great confidence in our strength . " " That 's reassuring , especially since so many of your people have made the bad mistake of going over to the Allies . I did n't approve , of course , but I understand the mule corps was of help to the British ... pity for them that they were so wasted . " The bastard was playing with him . He was the one who had deported them . His shrapnel had penetrated Moishe 's leg ... " You 're right , I 'm sorry to say not all of us have the same loyalties . " The pasha twirled the pencil in his hand and looked again at Dovid . If the Jew were lying he was damned convincing . Jamal Pasha almost believed him . If he were to continue using his valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good , calculated risk . . . " Well , now , how is production from the kibbutzim ? " Dovid took out the black book and read off the amounts of wheat , barley , and fodder as well as all the other essentials . When he 'd finished his mouth was very dry . Lying , even to this creature , was not the easiest thing in the world . " We 've had to push very hard to deliver this amount of production . I hope and believe that we can even increase it . " " Very commendable , " Jamal Pasha said , lighting a Turkish cigarette and handing one to Dovid . " Knowing how the Jews steal and hide what they grow from the government , I must compliment you that they apparentlywithhold so little from you . " Dovid would have gladly slit his throat ... the Jews were starving , the little they kept was scarcely enough to keep body and soul together . But he acknowledged the compliment with a smile .... Jamal Pasha watched through the window as David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stride of a man , the tone of his voice , the kx ) k in his eyes , and he again reassured himself that there was nothingNo Time For Tears 143in Landau 's demeanor that indicated the plans on his desk were even a curiosity . . . Still , never mind the excuse , he had been foolhardy to leave them out in the open , except how did he know Landau would come in while he was emptying his bladder ? Well , he would be sure that he was not again caught with his pants down . He almost smiled when he thought it . Jamal Pasha 's misgivings were more than matched by Dovid 's . When he felt safe , he stopped near a clump of eucalyptus trees and wiped the perspiration from his forehead . Fool , he 'd been a fool . He could have destroyed the whole operation , and been hanged for much less .. . Chapter Thirteen1 N THE LABORATORY at Athlit , a special tension was in the air as the men sat around the table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lingered on Absalom , whose good and generous words now came back to him . . . " I do n't give a damn whose plans we take , nobody needs a medal to destroy the Turks . Dovid and I are brothers . We have faced death together . If the majority rules that Dovid 's plan is better than mine , so be it . All I ask is that when the time comes I have the pleasure of pulling the rope that hangs Jamal Pasha ... " Aaron 's words broke into Dovid 's thoughts . " As you all know , in the beginning I was opposed to this idea . However , now I am involved and wish to give credit where it is due . The plan we accepted was Dovid 's , he has already begun to carry it out , at great personal risk . . . I think this meeting should be turned over to him . " Dovid was surprised , tried to collect his thoughts . " I would only like to remind you that under certain circumstances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure of his abilities to resist until he has undergone the brutal interrogation that the Turks are capable of . Their barbarism is not understood until experienced . In the event any of you are caught , you will be alone . Expect no help . As I call your names , you will take the oath that your lips will he scaled and no man will inform on another in order to save himself . Is that agreed ? " Cynthia Freeman 144 " It is , " the men responded in unison . Dovid looked around the table at the faces of these brave men , knowing that what he asked of them was too much , but it had to be asked . They were only human , and no man knew what his strengths were until that moment when the pain became impossible to bear . Life was a preciousgift , which every normal man clung to . Still . . . the oath might be remembered if the time came .. . With the Bible in his hand he called out , " Chaim Lazarus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other on the Bible , do you take the oath of silence ? " " I do . " " Lieb Schacham , do you take the oath ? " " I do . " Samuel Guri , Zalman Kishon , Nachman Shamir , Eliave Yitzehak , Alex Aaronson , Absalom Feinberg and Aaron Aaronson took the oath as well . From the finger of each a drop of blood was drawn . " Now we are brothers . . . From the Bible I will read these words . Netzah Yisrael Lo Ieshaker ... Israel 's eternity shall not lie . ' We are now members of the NILI . " A small glass of wine was handed to each man . " We drink to the salvation of our people , and their peaceful survival . Let us hope that when future generations bear the word NILI they will know that the cause we fought was theirs . " " Shalom , " they said , saluting Dovid . With his glass held high , Dovid saluted back , " Shalom . " The men were given their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHILE secretly passing the Samech station , properly disguised , and thoroughly terrified , Chaim Lazarus took note of the war materiel arriving . At Fuleh station , Lieb Schacham calculated the army units , and the number of officers being dispatched . . . . In Gilboa , Samuel Guri , outfitted in a uniform stolen by a Teutonic warrior more interested in gold than the Fatherland , drank with the German fliers . Once the wine and beer loosened their tongues , the information on planned air strikes began to flow ... . Aaron , the distinguished scientist , went north to gather information on the Turkish army . Everything was written in code and cipher in a smallNo Time For Tears 145black notebook . No language was discernible , only numbers in groups of five . The Turks would break their brains trying to break the code , even if they should capture the notebook . Absalom journeyed through Tyre and Acre . In Rosh-pina he discovered a military center and a local school that now served as a supply depot for ammunition . The Turks had apparently , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road as a military highway . He would suggest that the British dispatch planes with bombs to the site during the inauguration of the road ... . After seeing Jamal Pasha , Dovid went to Haifa , then proceeded to Tiberius and Beirut . He found that the Turks were planning to attack the Suez Canal again . In fact , the German commander , Kers Von Kerstein , had left the Suez Canal in mid-April . It seemed this second attack on the Suez was so close at hand that squadrons of German fliers were stationed in Dagania . Gaza had been reinforced with heavy artillery ... . With their staggering amount of information , the men met once again at Athlit . " To quote Herzl , " Dovid said , " If you will it , it need not remain but a dream . ' Now we have something to go to the British with . " " All right , but how do we create a link between ourselves and British headquarters in Egypt ? " Aaron 's question was in everyone 's mind . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would listen to you , " Dovid said . " I told you earlier , if I leave here it would arouse suspicion . No , the most likely one for this mission , I suggest , is Absalom . " " Why me ? As has been pointed out , I 'm not exactly a diplomat . " " True . . . but you will make special efforts ... Besides , and more important , when you feel like it , you can affect the manners of a gentlemanand that will impress the British . Also , your English is impeccable . That is why . " " And what about the how ? Do I swim or take a rowboat ? " " Neither . . . you will be smuggled aboard an American warship whose mission of mercy is to evacuate all neutral citizens . . . Details later ... " which meant keep them as secret as possible , even among this handpicked group . . . . On the way back to Zichron , Aaron suggested to Dovid that he take advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will , Aaron ... I miss her very much . " " I can imagine . She is a very unique woman , Dovid . Somehow she reminds me of Sarah , the same combination of beauty and strength . She 's been receiving the food ? " Cynthia Freeman 146 " Yes , thank God . " " Thank God , indeed . Who knows when the Arabs will begin their plunder . . . by the way , I have a bag of almonds and a box of dried fruits I 'd like you to give to my little Reuven . You wait , Dovid , he 's a born agronomist . " " I know , and he thinks I 'm a scientist . " " Who says he 's wrong ? " " The diplomas I do n't have . " " Diplomas do n't always make a man a scientist . Some men are born with an original mind , and are committed to what they believe in , no matter what . You , my friend , are one of them ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chavala could n't believe it . For a moment she could n't even catch her breath to welcome him . Then she ran to his outstretched arms , and they held each other as though they would never let go . " Oh God , Dovid . . . it 's you , thank you for coming . . . " She backed off , patted her hair and smoothed her dress . " I 'm embarrassed , the way I look . This is no way to greet my husband . . . the front of my dress is wet from washing . . . oh God , I 'm so excited to see you I forgot to ask if you 've eaten . . . come , sit down . . . no , go in and see Reuven while I change . " Then taking Dovid 's face in her hands she said , " I 'm acting like a moonstruck girl . . . oh , darling , how can I tell you what I feel ? Words only get in the way ... " That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay quietly , feeling the closeness of one another . Then Dovid took his wife again , this time unhurriedly . In that sweetness no war existed , no hate , nothing at all outside nurturing walls , only love . The world ceased ... . In their short time together not a word was said about how Chavala had survived , the fear and anxiety she felt every moment for Dovid 's safety . Nor the clawing loneliness . Nor did she ask about Zichron . She did not want to know , in fact . The night before he left she cooked a very special dinner and refused to think about tomorrow . Life was made up not of days , months or years , it was the moments that counted . . . only the moments . When he prepared to leave in the morning she smiled as though he would return that evening . She sent hint away with a box of homemade bread , cakes and cookies . " And give this box to Aaron . Thank him for the gift he sent , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tears . In their precious few moments together there was no time for tears . IN July , Absalom managed to leave Beirut on an American warship . Equipped with a Spanish passport  --  the Sephardim were useful even if they were snobbish  --  he made it past the ports and border checks without serious incident , although he nearly forgot at one point not to speak English but words of Spanish he 'd been carefully drilled in . Finally he arrived in Alexandria , but he was prevented from disembarking by the British authorities , who questioned his passport . Absalom decided the best approach was a direct one . He requested to be brought to British Intelligence headquarters immediately so that he could identify himself . The port officials were unimpressed . The man 's English was good but his story farfetched . He decided then to return to Greece and try again . As be miserably walked the deck he met a Jewish student and told him his real name . " They 're going to let you go ashore ? " Absalom asked him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British refused me entry . I must get into the country . I 'd like you to do me a favor . " " If I can ... " " You can . I 'm going to write out a note for you to take to the manager of the Anglo-Palestine bank in Alexandria . He can identify me . " The deed was done and the note served its purpose . Actually the connection had been set up through a connection in America , a prominentJewish scientist who had been impressed by Aaron 's research and had been contacted by Aaron to help . He in turn called a British colleague who was a brother of the manager of the Anglo-Palestine bank . Shortly thereafter Absalom was permitted to disembark . He was far less successful in arousing the interest of the British . Once again , their arrogance overwhelmed their self-interest . That night Absalom returned to the hotel a frustrated and bitter man . After brooding half the night he decided the only possible way to get the attention of the British was to publish an article in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile wrote the rest of the night , then hurried to the Egyptian Gazette with an article , signed by Anonymous , about the weakness of the Turkish regime and its armed forces . Together with provocative details on the size of their army . Cynthia Freeman 148The next afternoon he waited for the newspapers to come out , bought one and hurried to the Pharaoh Cafe , where he ordered coffee and scanned the paper . And there it was : It seems ludicrous that a people which boasts that the sun never sets on its empire was unaware that the Turkish army was almost nonexistent in Palestine and Syria during the Gallipoli campaign , since most of its units were deployed to defend Achi Baba and Constantinople . Only a small garrison had been left to defend Palestine and Syria . If the British had been less inclined to continue with the tradition of high tea at four , that small piece of real estate could have been taken with little or no effort . But what should one expect when a nation supposedly as strong as Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suez Canal . During that disorderly retreat the Turks almost tripped over one another . The time to have taken the initiative was then . It makes one ponder where British Intelligence was when , right out in front of God and king , the Turks were building the new military highway along the Gaza . How simple it would have been to dispatch a small squadronof planes and bomb the site . Imagine the surprise the Turks would have had if a small sortie flew over during the inauguration . It now seems a second attack on the Suez is close at hand . Perhaps Providence has given Britain another chance to prove herself . Perhaps it is still not too late if the British will consult with and consider the wisdom of those whose knowledge can , to say the least , supplement theirs . That was the first in a series of articles he bombarded the British with . To his delight , the articles brought about the desired reaction . At long last , the British were recognizing him .. . On August 8 , almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Niecomb in the major 's office . " Now , sir , you 've been rather bothersome with those articles . Iconfess they 've caused us embarrassment , and quite honestly I don'tunderstand what your reasons are , nor how they can benefit you  --  " " The truth is , Major Niecomb , they can benefit both of us . " " How so ? " " You failed in the Suez campaign because you had no intelligence network in either Palestine or Syria . If you had it would have been relatively easy for you to have pushed forward ... " Niecomb grimaced , knowing that there was more than a little truth in t hat statement . " So what are you suggesting ? " No Time For Tears 149 " Major , we have formed an espionage network in Palestine , to be put at the disposal of Britain  --  " " Of Britain ? For no other reason ? " " Of course . The more information you have the faster you can take action in Palestine . And we Jews would naturally benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would we have to pay for this intelligence ? " " Major Niecomb , I have n't come here to sell you secrets . I 've come in the name of my people , who believe that by helping Britain we will help ourselves . I 'm not a mercenary , nor is this offer made out of altruism . We have something that can be of great help to you  --  " " And how large is this network ? " " It 's small and secret , but very effective . " Small . . . and secret ... and no rewards . . . Niecomb was not impressed by Absalom , whom he regarded as a radical Jewish romantic , a dangerous , troublemaking sort looking for some grand adventure . Well , he was not about to be taken in by this Hebrew zealot . Lord , they surely were pushy . . . they really took seriously that nonsense about being the Chosen People . He ordered Absalom to leave Egypt immediately , and made a call that resulted twenty-four hours later in the dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron awaited anxiously for Absalom to return , or for a message from him about the link with British Intelligence headquarters . Weeks passed without any news . Dovid became especially impatient . " I 'm sure Absalom must be having trouble getting back . . . well , we ca n't wait any longer . This is too important , I 'm going to look for some way to get to Egypt . " " I suppose that 's the only answer , " Aaron said , shaking his head . " Now , what route are you thinking of ? If you go by land that means crossing the Sinai . Aside from the time involved  --  it 's just too dangerous . " " So that leaves the sea . . . " Dovid was not unaware that such passage was also a part of Absalom 's plans , but , of course , not having heard from Absalom , he had no way of knowing whether it had succeeded . IN I Iaifa a Christian Arab , Tioufit Butaj , who had less love for the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wise to support the JewsCynthia Freeman 150who might at some point soon be useful to him in saving his own neck , expressed his willingness to take Dovid to Egypt in his small boat  --  for a fee , of course . Saving one 's neck should not obscure commerce . But the British blockade made that transaction quickly obsolete , and so there was nothing left for Dovid except to once again enlist American contacts and procure passage on an American warship dispatched to evacuate people from the war zone . Appropriate papers were prepared and Dovid boarded the ship . When he arrived in Egypt he went to the president of the AngloPalestinebank  --  the manager ( thanks to Absalom ) had been compromised , apparently , by collaboration with the Jews , but the president was still above suspicion ; actually , he welcomed the opportunity to get back at the British , and the British , in their fashion , never imagined that a Jew who had reached such exalted position as president of a bank in association with the British would ever endanger himself or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his identity with a letter written by Aaron , Joseph Neiman was most receptive . Aaron considered Neiman the one remaining dependable link between Athlit and Cairo . As the two men sat in Neiman 's office , Dovid said , " It is imperative that I meet with the top-echelon British officer in their intelligence establishment . " Born an Egyptian Jew , and occupying the position he did , there were few people in high positions that Joseph Neiman did not know . " I think that can be arranged . I 'll make the contact for you . Where will you be staying ? " " At the Royal Hotel . I 'm registered under the name of Dovid Nadar . " The two men shook hands , and Neiman said , " I 'll be in touch . " The next day Dovid went to Alexandria , where he tried to find out about Absalom . The most he could ferret out was that Absalom was trying to get back to Palestine , but so far with little success . Hardly encouraging or enlightening news . Dovid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave his room . Finally the phone rang . . . it was Joseph Neiman . " I believe I have located your man . Go to British headquarters at ten o'clock tomorrow morning . You might ask for Lieutenant Wooly . " He hung up without waiting for Dovid 's response . Dovid was already more fortunate than Absalom ... though he had no way of knowing it ... Lieutenant Wooly had replaced Major Niecomb only a week before . No Time For Tears 151When Dovid was brought in to Lieutenant Wooly , he found him in appearance and manner the epitome of a British officer . He also spoke like one . . . with rather obvious suspicion of Dovid . " I understand that you have been asking to see me . " " Yes . I 'll get to the point , sir . In Palestine we have been gathering a very large amount of information that we believe you can use ... " Dovid took out a small black notebook and handed it to Wooly . Wooly could hardly believe what he saw . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forces and equipment , an in-depth survey of prices of supplies , sizes of crops , military plans of the Turks , including the one Dovid had seen on Jamal Pasha 's desk . Wooly maintained a British cool he hardly felt . " This is quite remarkable . Tell me , how were you able to gather such information ? " Dovid did n't miss the mixture in his voice of cautious hope and skepticism . He told the whole story , from the inception of NILI , and Aaron Aaronson 's involvement , with his reputation , added credibility . Still , only after nearly two hours of close questioning was Wooly able to convince himself of Dovid 's legitimacy , and thereby that of his material . " All I can say , Mr. Landau , is that this is truly remarkable . I will submit it to the high command in London . Thank you for coming to see me , we 'll be in touch . " Dovid waited for two agonizing days before he was summoned back to see Wooly . This time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lieutenant Wooly , " I believe we can say we have an agreement . Now I think we should discuss how contact can be made . " In a briefing room with four other intelligence officers Dovid said , " The harbor at Athlit will accommodate a small craft . I believe that the information could be handed over to the British by our men at NILI , who would , of course , encode . And I suggest we use light signals . They 're simple and fast . " The discussion went on until midnight . Finally , when all was arranged , Dovid was returned to Palestine on a small craft belonging to the British , disguised with Arab insignia . It was midnight when the boat slowly moved into a cove beyond the huge shoals of Athlit . The lieutenant stood by the rail and shook hands with Dovid . Dovid climbed down into the dinghy . He was rowed as fast as it was thought safe , then stripped off his clothes , tied them into a waterproof sack and jumped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar rocks . A large wave rolled over his head , the rocks were slippery with shiny green moss , but heCynthia Freeman 152somehow managed to hold on , reach the seawall and pull himself up . He was home . Shivering from the cold that went to the marrow of his bones , he slipped back into his clothes and moved stealthily through the night . He listened to the sounds of soldiers walking along the roads . He heard their laughter , and he held his breath as he lay in the high grass . He darted from place to place . . . until finally he reached the hills of Zichron , and from there to Aaron 's door . Aaron looked at a soaking wet Dovid , a broad grin on his face . " My God . . . Dovid , you did it . " " I did it . . . yes , I did it . " Embracing Dovid , Aaron said , " Now go change , put on one of my robes and I 'll fix a pot of coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eagerly Dovid was pumped to tell everything , from the very beginning . " Everything would take the two weeks I 've been away . . . and before I begin . . . have you heard from Absalom ? " He 's home . I 'll tell you more about that later . Please go on , Dov-id ... " " I have to give credit where it 's due , I was damned fortunate . This Lieutenant Wooly was more eager to work with us , if possible , than we were to make contact . The arrangement is that the contact will be made through a ship . We decided upon light signals . A boat will land near the Crusaders ' Castle and from there the materiel will be collected . Now , I think we must decide on dividing our roles . Aaron , you pick the men you feel best suited for gathering information . . . I would like to work with Lieb Schacharn , he 's a great swimmer , which for a landlubber like me could be a saving grace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sea had been set when Dovid was in Alexandria . On the appointed night Dovid and Absalom waited but the ship did not arrive . " What do you think happened , Dovid ? " " Maybe they were spotted . One thing we know , if they have n't come by now , they wo n't . It 's almost dawn . " Night after night they lay in the bushes , waiting . On the fourth night they heard the low murmur of the ship passing , but it could not come in close enough to anchor because of the foggy weather . And during the next four nights it could not approach because of the storm-driven rains . Dovid 's trip to Egypt had apparently been for nothing  --  which he could n't accept . I is would go to Egypt once again . No Time For Tears 153IN the laboratory at Athlit Dovid met with Aaron and Absalom . " How would you like to go on a hegira through the Sinai , Absalom ? " " Since I 'm practically an Arab , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of an expert at it by now . It 's the way I survived and got back from Egypt after the British turned me down . The British may say they 're against the Arabs and the Turks , but the real enemy . . . at least that 's the way they made me feel . . . is the Jews . " Absalom had regaled Aaron and later Dovid with fairly harrowing accounts of his long journey home , including one encounter with an Arab man and his woman which he refused to talk about , except to say that at the time he wondered if the price of survival was worth it . . . " What is your plan , Dovid ? " " We 've got to make contact . Never mind what you and I may think of the British , they are the only hope we have . We must get to them with our information . " " Dovid , how would you get through the border patrol ? " Aaron said . " There 's no other way . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no alternative . But with Absalom 's knowledge of the desert , and his ability to speak the language , we have a good chance of making it . Do you agree , Absalom ? " " Agreed ... " DISGUISED as Bedouins , they left Zichron . As Aaron watched his two best friends go off in the distance he prayed that they would make it safely . A man could stand just so much loss in his life .. . In Chan-Hunes they were stopped and questioned . Absalom explainedthat they were representatives from the experimental farms at Hadera and Athlit , and that they were tracing the origins of the locusts . The local army commander accepted their explanation and , in fact , offered them the use of a telegraph . Dovid cabled Aaron : " The locusts have not yet been traced . " The double meaning was instantly clear to Aaron . The border was now so close that Dovid and Absalom were sure they 'd make it . Their enthusiasm was short-lived . Near El-Katharan , only a few hours ' walk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested by a border guard . Each man was subjected to a relentless barrage of questions . . . there were no locusts in this area that the interrogators knew of , and if they were the locust officials they claimed to be , then why had n't they been equipped with a vasika , a free access permit ? Cynthia Freeman 154No story or excuse helped , and they were transferred to Beersheba for further interrogation . When they arrived the German officials were as unconvinced as the border guards had been . They were taken off to jail . It was clear that the authorities strongly suspected that they were spies , and once again the end of a rope seemed an almost inevitable end . Within the Yishuv there were eyes and ears everywhere , but to save them immediate action was necessary . . . Max Ben-Eliezer , a Shomer in Ruhama , the most southern village in the country , became the courier between Dovid and Solomon Bartov . At risk to his own life , Bartov went every day to collect the notes and scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From his hand the notes were then passed on to Nathan Eliav , who rode to Zichron , where Aaron finally learned of the imprisonment . Separately , the men were interrogated hours on end . When they stood firmly behind their story , the torturing began . Dovid was thrashed on the soles of his feet , then dragged down the stone corridor into a windowless cell , with the door bolted behind him . Absalom underwent the same horrors , but at least he had not , like Dovid , gotten a violent attack of malaria . . . In the middle of the night he rapped on the stone wall that separated the two cells . No response . He wondered if Dovid were still alive . Sliding down on the cold stone ground he had nothing to do but consider his own dismal future . . . it was n't so much dying that enraged him , but to die without having seen Sarah ... He thought only of her . As long as he could stay alive , she was his bridge to sanity . Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imposing dining room of her husband 's house , looked positively regal in her gold brocade , and her emerald and diamond jewels shimmered in the candle glow . Her radiance charmed General Von Himmelstein . This Jewess was enchanting , but how could she he married to such a boor ? She made the other women seen pale in every respect by comparison . No Time For Tears 155 " How do you find living in Constantinople ? " " Fascinating , and you ? " " Hardly Berlin . . . but with war , one settles for less . " " I can imagine . " " Then you have been there ? " " Yes , once , with my brother . " " Then you know what I mean . " " Of course . " She smiled , but scarcely listened . Here she lived in luxury while her people starved . And for all the indulgences of her husband , he 'd not sent a coin to Palestine . He grew richer and richer from the war and was oblivious to the suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her loathing for him had become so great she would no longer even depreciate herself by living with him . Although she had entered into a loveless marriage , in the beginning it seemed unimportant . . . she had sacrificed for what she honestly believed was Rivka 's happiness , this man was genuinely fond of her , and that was enough . Children , to whom she could give all her devotion and love , would have compensated for all she 'd given up , but she soon learned he was unable to give her the longed-for child . Now she was grateful she had none .. . She was taken out of her reverie when she saw her husband nod from across the table to her , which was the cue for the ladies to retire to the drawing room so the men could smoke their long black cigars and sip their brandies while talking behind closed doors of how to cheat the governmenton materiel issued to the army . Sarah sat on the brocade divan and poured the demitasse for the ladies , who discussed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of France . . . Such a shame the Germans had n't conquered the French yet . . . Of course these local merchants who called themselves couturiers were too dreadful for words . . . Well , that was war and one had to put up with the inconveniences . . . Sarah thought of the hills of Zichron , about the vague letters she received from Aaron and nothing from Absalom . After the guests had left , Sarah went uneasily to the bedroom . She undressed , put on her peignoir and sat at the dressing table , brushing her hair . She saw her husband 's reflection as he spoke to her while taking off his clothes . " You were indeed an asset to inc this evening , my dear . Von I limmclsteinwas quite taken with you  --  " Cynthia Freeman 156 " And that pleased you ? " " Of course , like the emerald around your neck , a beautiful wife can be invaluable . Your charm hardly hinders my position . In the case of Von Himmelstein , it was indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He happens to admire beautiful women . " " And that does n't in some way offend you ? Most husbands would resent another man expressing his thoughts so openly . " " Not where Von Himmelstein is concerned . . . " She was being weighed by the pound . . . like his gold . " What makes him the exception ? " " Every government purchase order has to be approved by him . " " I see . . . and the two of you discreetly cheat the government . Instead of an item costing ten dollars , the price the government is charged is twenty and you and the general  --  " He laughed . " You 're much too bright for a woman .... " After a sleepless night Sarah impatiently waited for her husband to leave . That morning she sat across the table from him as a dutiful wife . Went through all of the usual amenities of pouring his coffee and butteringhis toast as he sat like a contented potentate . As he wiped the crumbs from his moustache and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scarlet sari and rubies this evening , my dear . We 'll have the pleasure of entertaining a most distinguished Turkish official . " " Will he also be enchanted with me , do you think ? " " Now , Sarah . . . well , I must leave . . . you will remember to be attentive to the governor 's wife this afternoon at tea ? " " I 'll remember every word you 've said . " When he was finally gone , Sarah leaned heavily against the door . Then she went quickly to her boudoir . Her personal maid had already prepared her bath and laid out her frock . She went through the usual routine of the morning except for one variation . . . she wrote a note to her husband . There was no salutation : I will be out of your reach by the time you read this . There are not sufficient jewels in the world to keep me living with a man as despicable as you . If you try to come after me I will expose your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . I'or a woman I am indeed very bright . and nry brother is not without influence . No Time For Tears 157She left the note , sealed , on his shaving stand , then opened the safe , took out the contents and laid them on the dresser . With a sense of relief she took off her wedding ring and placed it on top of the jewel case .... When the time came she stepped into a limousine and was driven to the governor 's mansion . She was the model of propriety and graciousnessthat would have made her husband feel his investment in her was worth every one of his jewels . When it came time to leave , Sarah walked through the huge bronze doors to the street , where her chauffeur waited . " Drive me to Madame Armound 's . " When the driver left her off she entered the couturier 's shop and waited until the chauffeur parked the car , then slipped out and hurried along the crowded street in the opposite direction . When she reached the marketplace she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of shoes , some lingerie and a small overnight case . Leaving the shop she got into a cab that took her to the railroad station . When she had finally been seated and leaned back in the coach , for the first time the tensions eased some . From Constantinople she traveled to Damascus . The trip was a nightmare ... trains were being requisitioned for the military , the searches were constant and the malfunctions were endless . For hours at a time she would wait until the parts were repaired . After what seemed like a month she finally got back to Zichron . The tension and weariness still showed in her face , but she would recover . . . she was home . When she stood and looked at her hilltop , the tears came from her eyes . She forgot her fatigue and ran up the incline until , breathlessly , she opened the door to her beloved home . Echoes of her childhood rang in her ears . . . ema . . . abba . . , sounds of " Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Emily Bronte . . . Rivka . . . starched white dresses . . . pink hair ribbons . . . Aaron . . . dear Aaron . . . beloved Absalom . . . And then her mother came into the room . Malka Aaronson stood in hushed silence for a long moment . This was too much to take in . Then they were in each other 's arms as their words mixed with tears . " Sarahla , you 're home " . . . " Oh yes , ema , " . . . " Dear God , I ca n't believe it , am I dreaming ? " . . . " No , ema , it 's no dream , I 've come home , and you 'll never lose me again ... " Now Malka held her daughter at arm 's length . Suffering was in her daughter 's eyes , but there would he time to talk later . " Come , Sarah , you must rest  --  " Cynthia Freeman 158 " No , please . . . where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs and refresh yourself . You will see him at dinner , but first you 'll want to see Aaron . " Sarah crossed the courtyard to her brother 's small house . She hesitated for a moment . What would he say ? Would Aaron  --  or her father  --  disapprove of her running away from a husband who had given her every luxury ? More to the point . . . marriage was a contract , presumably sacred and not to be broken . Would he understand that she had to leave to save her sanity ? She took a deep breath , opened the door and saw Aaron reading . When he looked up , his reaction was like his mother 's shock . Slowly he got up from the chair , not quite believing she was there , then quickly took her in his arms and held her tight . In that moment Sarah knew she had returned to them . She was home . Without words of explanation , she knew Aaron somehow understood . " Sarah , darling , you 're home . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa . Sarah was already feeling a sense of peace she 'd not known since her marriage . They sat in silence , looking out at the rolling hills of Carmel , to the vineyard where abba was working the soil between the vines . The oleanders were in bloom . God , Sarah thought , this was home , and it was as close to paradise as she would ever be . Or want to be . And then she turned to him , and her story poured out . She talked about her life . . . her husband . . . his insensitivity . . . " I felt as though I was prostituting myself , taking his gifts that had been paid for in blood . In Constantinople we knew what was happening to the Armenians , and life went on . While I sat at my husband 's lavish dinners , being the grand hostess , bedecked and bejeweled , an entire Armenian village was being wiped out . As I sipped tea with the governor 's wife their villages burned to the ground . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding ? You must have heard about it here in Eretz Yisroel . " Aaron nodded . " But I 'm afraid hearing and seeing are two different things . Some people in Constantinople were even denying it as propaganda against the Turks . They said that the warmongers were deliberately stirring up horror stories to inflame world opinion . But where are the civilized voices ? I 've heard no outcries . The Turks are so barbaric they left the roadsides stacked with corpses waiting to be buried . And the graves of those who had been were so shallow the human forms could he seen bulging beneath the dirt . Dead children , almost skeletons , were strewn about . WomenNo Time For Tears 159raped a hundred times , then left to die of starvation . I heard about and I saw some of these sights when I traveled , though I was n't supposed to . The sound of the train wheels reverberated in my ears , and , Aaron , it sang out its warning , ' The Jews are next . . . the Jews are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears to drown out the prophecy . . . Yes , Aaron , we are next and the world wo n't hear our cries , either . We have to save ourselves , Aaron ... something has to be done before it 's too late ... " Sarah was trembling so , Aaron brought her a brandy . When she 'd calmed some , Aaron said , " Something will be done , Sarah ... " " We 've said that for so long . . . where does our help come from ? " " Ele'azar asked that on another hilltop . When he stood in Herod 's temple at Masada and prayed , he found the answer . We here on our hilltop will find ours . Now , dearest , I think ema will be waiting for us to have dinner , and abba will be anxious to see you ... " Sarah felt a strangeness . . . an evasiveness in Aaron . She had felt something of it in his letters . It was as though he wanted to tell her but could n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me . What is it ? " " Nothing , Sarah . . . nothing . " " I know you too well , Aaron . . . Whatever it is I want to help . " He looked at her closely . Did he dare put her in the kind of dangerknowledge of NILI would bring ? Did he have a right not to ? " What is it ? " And then slowly he told her about NILI , how it had come about ... When he had almost finished he said , " The Yishuv knows nothing ... some of the Shomrim are against us . . . but above all , the village must not know . No one except those few who are involved . Ema and abba do not know and must never find out  --  " " What about our brothers ? Do Alex , Zvi and Shmuel know ? " " Only Alex is involved . I 'm afraid we have a house divided . Zvi is in the Negev , and Shmuel in Galilee . It 's best that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Aaron tried to turn away . " What is it , Aaron , please tell me . . . I 'm a woman , not a child you can protect . I can help . " There was a long pause , " Absalom is in jail . " " Dear God , no ! Where ? " " At Beersheba. "
