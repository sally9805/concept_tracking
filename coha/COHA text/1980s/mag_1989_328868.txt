Art and politics are often a volatile mix . Add sex , and the mix becomes combustible . A case in point : on June 12 Washington 's Corcoran Gallery of Art abruptly canceled an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe 's work , which included sadomasochistic and homoerotic photographs . " We really felt this exhibit was at the wrong place at the wrong time , " explained museum director Christina Orr-Cahall . " We had the strong potential to become some persons ' political platform . " <P> The " persons " Orr-Cahall was talking about are mostly on Capitol Hill , and they oversee the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts , which partly subsidized the Mapplethorpe show with a $30,000 grant . The NEA was already enmeshed in controversy over an earlier grant of $15,000 to photographer Andres Serrano , among whose works is a picture titled Piss Christ , depicting a crucifix submerged in the artist 's urine . Mapplethorpe , who died of AIDS in March , produced equally provocative work : his oeuvre includes pictures of nude children in erotic poses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other violent and homosexually explicit poses . When some of the work was exhibited at New York 's Whitney Museum last summer , there were averted eyes , even among those who make a career out of being avant-garde and supersophisticated . <P> The First Amendment has never entertained a blush factor . Free artistic expression is broadly guaranteed . The question is whether the right of free expression carries along with it the privilege of federal subsidy . New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato , who tore up the Serrano catalog on the Senate floor , concedes the artist 's " right to produce filth " but adds that " taxpayers ' dollars should not be utilized to promote it . " <P> The protest quickly spread across the political spectrum . On May 18 , 36 Senators signed a letter asking for changes in the NEA 's grant-making procedures so that " shocking , abhorrent and completely undeserving " art would not get money . At the prompting of Texas Congressman Dick Armey , 107 members of the House sent a similar letter to the endowment . <P> The congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisans who contend that withholding funds or threatening to do so amounts to Government censorship . Political whim , their argument goes , should not be the judge of art . What shocks one generation  --  a Madonna set in a shabby tenement , for example  --  is treasured by a later one . Moreover , art that flouts convention by dealing with the extremities of the human condition is the work most in need of support . <P> The other side holds that Mapplethorpe 's work is pornography posing as art . His works , this faction contends , should be shown privately , preferably in a red-light district . In fact , some of Mapplethorpe 's work is so graphic that if authorities had chosen to do so , they could have prosecuted him for child pornography , which has no First Amendment protection .
