The Institutional Revolutionary Party ( P.R.I. ) , which has been the controlling force in Mexican politics for half a century , is anything but revolutionary . Nor is it a party in the sense generally understood in Western democracies . But the P.R.I , is an institution : since its organization in 1929 , it has not lost a single presidential election . The President , the most influential man in the party , rules Mexico like a virtual monarch for six years . Then , after consulting with a few powerbrokers , he designates his heir . In a blitzkrieg campaign , the successor is paraded before the voters , who give him an overwhelming victory . Says a Western diplomat in Mexico City : " The only comparable party in the world is the Soviet Communist Party . " <P> Mexico 's durable one-party system emerged from the fratricidal Revolution of 1910 , which toppled the 34-year rule of Dictator Porfirio Diaz . In the ensuing ten years , more than 1 million Mexicans died as one faction after another tried to wrest control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloodletting , outgoing President Plutarco Elias Calles founded what later became the P.R.I , as a coalition of military leaders , landholders and workers dedicated to the reforms called for in a constitution that had been drawn up in 1917 but was never respected . The party promised economic equality , universal education and the return of foreign holdings to Mexican ownership-all in the name of what was to be a permanent revolution . <P> Although all those ambitious goals have not been realized , the P.R.I . ' s principal achievement is having brought political stability to Mexico . The cost , however , has been high . Innovation has generally been repressed , and genuine pluralism does not exist . The concentration of power in a single party has also created a vast system of patronage in which political debts are routinely paid off in cash or favors . The sweeping powers of the presidency , moreover , have led to the kind of abuses that became widespread under Jos Lpez Portillo . Although the P.R.I , enjoys the support of an estimated 13 million registered members and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routinely manipulates the results to increase the margin of victory . The P.R.I . ' s defenders respond that the system is " evolutionary , " indirectly reflecting the will of the majority through an internal party consensus . Still , many Mexicans are deeply cynical about the process . Says Pablo Gmez , secretary-general of the United Socialist Party of Mexico ( P.S.U.M. ) , which won third place with 3.7% of the votes last July : " There are a million cracks in the P.R.I. , and it is burning itself out . " <P> If that is so , why does the P.R.I , retain such massive support ? One reason is the fear of a return to political instability . Another is the party 's permeation of daily life . Says a foreign analyst : " Every sector of society owes , and is owed to . " Equally pervasive is a traditional respect for authority , which is channeled into support of the P.R.I . Despite the periodic calls for a truly competitive party system and the strains imposed by the current economic crisis , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few sure things in Mexico 's future .
