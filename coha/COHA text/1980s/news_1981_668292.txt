By Miriam F. d ' Amato y husband and I climbed our first mountain , Gorham Mountain in Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island in Maine , five years ago . We needed no pitons , ropes , or sleeping bags , because the climb and descent took only five hours , including frequent pauses to enjoy all the new perspectives of the trail . When we reached the summit , marked by a neat wooden sign giving us the elevation ( 525 feet ) , we were alone . We stood on the bare , gently sloping rock and looked far down at the winding road below , the green-to-black swaths of forests , and the blue-and-white ocean ruffling to a sharply marked horizon . This , I thought , must be how the gulls feel when they glide on an updraft and survey the world beneath . We sat on the warm rock and poured cups of rosehips tea from our thermos and ate a few nuts and raisins . For half an hour , we sipped and looked , lifting our faces to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended by a different route . Climbing up , we had been focussing on the changes in the path as we approached the peak . But , going down , we could look out and beyond until we finally re- entered the forest and walked slowly back to our car . Climbing Gorham Mountain was the first of many dayhikes since the evening we literally found our first Appalachian Mountain Club trail guide on the rock ledges of Seawall Campground in Acadia . That little blue book designed to fit into a dungaree pocket , led us into the varied , exhilarating , and joyous world of the dayhiker . Let me make it clear that we are neither ardent nor intrepid explorers of forests and mountains . On our annual one- or two-week camping trips , usually in Acadia , we revisited our favorite places , walked along the shore , and took the walks guided by the National Park rangers . We had noted , without appreciating their significance , the brown wooden signs pointing to " Gorge Path " or " The South Ridge Trail . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experienced backpackers who happily dug latrines , chose edible plants and berries for their wilderness meals , and could set up and take down their bright orange tents in less than five minutes . We were contentedly resigned to our family tent and a campfire to grill steaks on . But the night we found the " AMC Trail Guide to Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park , " we spent an hour idly leafing through it . " Climbing and walking on Mount Desert Island is a most rewarding experience , " we read . " Trails are maintained and marked , providing a unique network of mountain , lakeshore and seaside paths . " Further on , the booklet informed us , " Paths of any desired degree of difficulty can be had from the mildest lakeside , graded path to the Precipice Trail on Champlain Mountain where ladder rungs driven into rock are a welcome aid . " And " For the most part , the individual summits are possible in comfortable half-day walks . . . . All trails described are maintained by the USNPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs , cairns , painted arrows and red metal markers . " The trail guide devotes a succinct paragraph or two to describing each trail and its route , and gives distances from point to point in miles and kilometers as well as estimated walking times . The waterproof map that folds neatly into its back cover is clearly marked to show the steepness of the ascents and all connecting trails , so that a circular hike , with very littlebacktracking , can often be planned . It was the descriptions of the trails , factual and even laconic as they were , that tempted us . Gorham Mountain Trail , for example , is described as rising " gently over open ledges 0.3 m. to a junction where the Cadillac Cliffs loop trail leads R ( ight*. rejoining the Gorham Mountain Trail 0.5 m. later after passing under and by ancient sea cliffs and caves . " This trail happened to be the first described in the guide book , but those ancient sea cliffs and caves approximately 500 feet above present sea level fascinated us . We went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost daily hikes for the rest of our stay . Planning them was part of the enjoyment . " Which should we do ? " we would ask each other , choosing among the riches . Should it be Flying Mountain ( 284 feet ) , which " offers perhaps the greatest reward on this island for a small amount of effort . A few minutes ' climb to the open top brings one a fine panorama . . . " ? Or Cadillac Mountain ( 1530 feet ) , " . . . the highest point on the island . Because of its height , it offers the most commanding views " ? Or the Penobscot Mountain Trail to the Sargent Pond Trail , which includes Sargent Pond , " a delightful spot nestling between Penobscot and Sargent Mountains , " where you can swim at an altitude of 1060 ft. ? We hiked those and more . We climaxed one of our trips with a seven-hour climb : up Cadillac Mountain along the North Ridge Trail , a lunch of cold rock crab at the summit , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now nine years old , to find the trail markers and cairns , and she has been leading us since she was six . Her particular delights are the ladders going straight up ( for a distance of six to ten feet , and firm as the rock they ' re attached to ) or the wooden bridges laid solidly over ravines . Ours are the fresh , free worlds we can travel and the new intimacy we find with the places we visit . We have learned by now what preparations and precautions are necessary . We invested in sturdy hiking boots and wool socks , but many people hike in sneakers or good shoes . We carry , in a pack , a thermos of tea and one of water or fruit juice and snacks such as fruit and nuts , or , occasionally , a sandwich . We always bring , no matter what the weather , sweatshirts andwindbreakers , and mosquito repellent for the forested areas , though the bare summits are delightfully cool and bug-free . Most important , we noted our walking times and compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurately . Once , we miscalculated the time and were forced to hurry down a steep path at sunset because we had no flashlight . On another early climb , we found ourselves in the middle of a trip of four hours instead of the one we had intended , and went without a drink and lunch . We found one trail , described as " spectacular with views , " a little too narrow for our comfort , though the views were , indeed , spectacular . Following AMC trails with common sense care is the safest way to discover any area . At intervals frequent enough for the most timid hiker are markers , cairns , and the signs along the trails that announce directions and distances and intersecting trails . The guides make it possible to penetrate the forests , climb the mountains , and explore the streams and rivers of AMC-maintained areas at your own pace . Hiking in Acadia is only one possible choice . We spent a recent weekend in the White Mountains of New Hampshire that was a vivid demonstration of the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hadn ' t been in the area for 20 years and remembered only The Flume and the aerial tramways . So before wewent , we bought the " AMC White Mountain Guide " - 483 pages plus index . The guide contains detailed information about 22 areas , with additional sections on the club ' s activities , the New England Trail Conference , and an introduction giving guidelines for hikers to ensure that their excursions " provide a combination of outdoor pleasure and healthful exercise . " On our first afternoon , while driving along Route 3 to re- acquaint ourselves with the area , we noted the familiar signs along the road announcing hiking trails . Many parking lots and roadside picnic areas had three or four pointing off into the woods . So , over dinner that first night , we made ourplans using the guide . The next day , we followed , for an hour , a fascinating and lovely forest trail aptly named " Falling Waters Trail , " which led us past four waterfalls in 1.4 miles and promised more up ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000-mile route between Georgia and Maine that Edward Abbey has lovingly called " a ridiculous footpath . " We climbed to Lonesome Lake Hut ( elevation 2743 feet ) on the west shore of Lonesome Lake and got our first look at an alpine hut , one of the AMC accommodations for backpackers , a system unique to New Hampshire . A family group of about 30 people , aged two months to over 60 years , had reserved the hut for the night . They told us they always planned one yearly hike and overnight stay at a different New Hampshire site . The Appalachian Mountain Club was organized in 1876 and is the oldest and largest mountain club in the United States . Membership is not a prerequisite for using its facilities and guides , though the annual $20 dues ( $25 the first year ) includes a subscription to the Bulletin and special prices for accommodations . Novice hikers are given sympathetic understanding , as demonstrated by the notes " To the owner of this book " in the White Mountain guide : " . . . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , allow ample time , as your morning quota of energy will have lost some of its get- up-and-go . " The AMC also encourages comments on the trail descriptions in the guides for possible use in the periodically revised editions . " When you go over a trail , " the notes say , " please check the description in the book . Do not be deterred by the lack of experience . The viewpoint of one unfamiliar with the trail is especially valuable . " This applies to experienced hikers unfamiliar with the particular trails in the guide and to inexperienced hikers who depend heavily on all the information given . The AMC discreetly leaves out of its notes the fact that dayhiking is addictive . It will lead you deeper into the study of woods , forests , and water than you might at first expect to go . You will find yourself looking at trees and plants and listening to bird calls and wanting to identify them ; you will begin to listen to the different sounds water can make and look at the curving rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to you when you feel the changes in winds and the temperature close to a peak or in a valley or on a path through the woods . Walking for an hour or two will also give you a new awareness of your own body and a chance to let your mind wander as freely as the breeze . When a trip to Maine , New Hampshire , or New York is not possible , you can seek out places nearer home . The AMC has provided generously for the growing interest in walking . A new series of guides will give you the same useful and tempting information as the trail guides . " Country Walks Near Boston " by Alan Fisher was the first , published in 1976 , one hundred years after the founding of the club . " Country Walks Near New York " by William Scheller is also available , and will be followed soon by " Country Walks Near Montreal , " Baltimore , Washington D.C. , and Philadelphia . Whether you walk for views or for exercise , for an hour or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You must be born into the family of the Walkers , " said Thoreau in his essay " Walking . " Many of us were , and have simply forgotten our birthright . Miriam E. d ' Amato is a freelance writer from Winthrop . For information . . .
