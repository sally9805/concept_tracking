 | When Dave and Margaret Price had been married for seven years , they adopted a sixweek-old baby girl and brought her home to a pink-andwhite nursery . Margaret put her into the waiting crib , smiled up at her husband and said , " Oh , Dave , is n't she beautiful ? She has blue eyes and her hair 's going to curl . She could be our own child . " " From now on she is our own child , " he said . And that 's the way it was . They named her Barbara , and there was never any question that she was their child and they were her parents . Barbara even looked like them in the small ways most children resemble their parents . During that baby time , Margaret had wondered about telling Barbara that she was adopted . She and Dave talked about it . " They say you should tell children , " Margaret said . " Why ? " " Because they 're bound to find it out and it alienates them . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It hurts them in some way . I do n't know . You should tell them , that 's all . " " In that case we 'll tell her , " Dave said . " When ? " He laughed . " When she can speak English , " he said . In those first days Margaret would hold Barbara , rock her and sing to her , and sometimes she would say softly , " Barbara dear , you are adopted , which makes you extra special . It means we wanted you so much we went out and found you , " and she would murmur and sing while Barbara gurgled and slept , and mother warmth and child warmth mingled and bound them close . However , time passed and the right moment never presented itself so that Barbara started school without knowledge of her background . Eventually we 'll talk about it , Margaret thought . Not in a disturbing way , with demands and accusations , but naturally , and they would meet it as they met other issues . It would have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she go to the store with Kathy and her mother ? could she have a two-wheel bicycle ? was she adopted ? But the subject did n't arise until the day when Margaret had almost ceased to think about it . It came without warning , confronting her abruptly so that she stood , hands frozen in the act of folding clothes as she and Barbara packed . Barbara was 12 and going to camp for the first time . She was wild with excitement . Margaret was not . She worried about the water , and poison ivy and snakes , but she suppressed what she felt and sewed on name tapes . In the middle of the goingaway whirl Barbara looked across the bed and said , " Mother , I 'm adopted , are n't I ? " The soft scent of summer filled the room . From outside came the sound of children in the next yard . The clothes she was folding smelled of soap and sunshine , and suddenly . in that one moment , the room grew silent , there was an abrupt cessation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mother , I asked you a question . Was I adopted or was n't I ? " Margaret nodded , her face ashen . " Yes , " she whispered . " Yes , you were . " " I thought so , " Barbara said . " Kathy said something once that made me think I was , and then when I had the camp physical I saw my charts and they said so . Why did n't you ever tell me ? " " I was going to , " Margaret said and slowly she resumed her folding . slowly the room came back into focus . " I planned to . Daddy and I always thought ... well , we thought there would be a good time . " " Are you glad that you adopted me ? " Barbara asked . " Of course , " Margaret said , and the bird 's song grew stronger . " Of course . We wanted you so very much . We never think of your being adopted . You 're just our own . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you ever know what she was like ? " " Who ? " " My mother . My real mother . Barbara said . " Did you know her ? " " No . " Margaret shook her head and the words " my real mother " repeated themselves in her mind . " You are n't supposed to , you know , " she said . " All we knew was that you  | needed us and that we wanted you . " " I 'm glad you wanted me , " Barbara said . She came around the bed and lugged Margaret and smiled . And then , standing there close to each other , Barbara said , " Do you suppose I could ever find out who my real mother was ? " " I do n't know . " " Would n't you want to know , if you sere me ? " she said . " Perhaps . " " Is n't there some way we could find out ? " " I do n't know . " " Could you ask ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records were sealed in such matters , but times were changing . Now perhaps they could get some information . Barbara 's face was innocent of anger or distress . Only a little girl 's natural curiosity shone in her expression , and the fear that had lain dormant in Margaret suddenly seemed unimportant compared to the concern in her daughter 's face . " Well , " Margaret . said , " let 's make a bargain . We 'll agree that when you are sixteen we will look for the records and sell try to find out what you want to know . " " Why should we wait ' til I 'm six-teen ? " " Because by then you 'll be old enough to understand what the records tell us . " " What would n't I be able to understand now ? " " Lots of things , " Margaret said , thinking of unwanted pregnancies and all the reasons for them that no 12 year old could understand . " Is it a bargain , or is n't it ? " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The words ? my real mother ? lingered in Margaret 's mind , and she waited for time to pass , not sure if Barbara would continue to want to know the answers . There were so many things to fill her thoughts ? how could she keep worrying about a past that was less important with each passing year ? But one day just before her sixteenth birthday Barbara said , " Hey ! We have a deal , do n't we ? " " What deal ? " Margaret asked , pulling up a piece of grass and biting it , soaking in the sunshine and the green-grass scent of spring , and pretending not to remember her promise . " You know , " Barbara said , " my birthday . You said we would try to find out who my mother was , my real mother . " " Oh , yes , " Margaret said . " I 'd almost forgotten about that . " @#  | " Well , I have n't , " said Barbara . " How do we go about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to keep her part of the bargain , she had not considered it , and she said slowly , " I suppose we 'll have to ask Daddy . " " It ought to be a simple matter of public record , " Dave said . " I 'll get in touch with the people at social services and see what I can do . Are you sure , Margaret ? What 's the point ? " " I promised and it means something to her . " " I wish it did n't , " he said . " So do I. " There was no need to say more . It had been enough for them to have her . Barbara was conceived by their love for each other as much as if she had been born of their own flesh , and they wished it were the same for her . Still , they understood her desire to know , so Dave went to the agency for help , and by the time Barbara 's birthday arrived he had as much of an answer as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let down , " he said . " One of these days the records might be unsealed , but right now what 's available is limited to general background information . " " Such as ? " " What her mother 's occupation was and her father 's . Whether or not they were educated ? that sort of thing . " Margaret sighed . Perhaps it would be enough . " I suppose I 'll have to prepare her , " she said . " I 'll take her out on her birthday and try to make it significant in some way . There is n't anything else we can do . " She and Barbara left late in the morning with the sun bright on the road , they stopped for lunch at a country inn that smelled of scented candles and spice . " Now then , " said Margaret , taking up the menu , " this is your birthday so let 's order something special . " She felt a great need to keep things light , so she began to talk about the fall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force Barbara to look ahead as the minutes passed . She knew that they were soon to look back , to open pages of a closed book . Back in the car , she felt a mounting dread . She did n't want to look back . Life should never be " what might have been , " life should always be " what is to come . " Barbara gazed fixedly ahead as they approached their exit . It was not like her to be withdrawn , and after a while Margaret said , " Why so silent ? " " I was just thinking , " Barbara said , " about being born when you are an accident . People should be born because they are wanted and planned , not because they are an accident . " " That 's true , " said Margaret . " I keep thinking about her , " Barbara mused , " and how she must have felt to be having a baby she did n't want . I suppose she hated me and hated being pregnant . What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret said . How could she know ? " Well , what do you think she felt ? " Barbara persisted . " I do n't really care , " Margaret said , her tone flat and cold . " I am tired of thinking about her . All that matters to me is what I felt . I wanted a baby so much and I could n't have one , and the only thing that counts is that she had a baby and because of that I have a daughter . That 's all I think about . " The words had a final ring and the moment they were out she regretted them . There should have been a better thing to say . The day , which had been bright with sunshine and good feeling , was suddenly spoiled . They sat in silence as the car swung into the heart of downtown and to the parking garage . They started for the stairs as they had in the past , only this time there was no fun in it , no shopping planned , no movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill a dreaded commitment . Margaret glanced at Barbara and noted her expression , her dragging steps , and her heart ached for her child . " You must n't be disappointed , Barbara , " she said . " Why should I be disappointed ? " Barbara asked , her tone cold .  | " I 'm sorry , " Margaret said gently . " I 'm sorry I said what I did . I do n't blame you for wanting to know . I probably would too . It 's just that we 've never thought about it . I wanted a baby so much . How can I imagine what it would be like not to want a baby ? When I think about her I am so grateful that she did n't want you . I just ca n't think beyond that . " Barbara bit her lips and began to nod and swallow rapidly . Her face was the soft study of childhood , caught in the intensity of a young woman 's deep feeling , and Margaret smiled . " I do understand , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be any names , just general information . What your mother did to earn a living ? what your father did . You wo n't know what she looked like , or what her voice sounded like or how she felt . You can never know those things about your real mother , unless you keep trying to find out and the laws change , and if you do that you 'll be living in the past instead of going on into the future . Can you understand what I 'm saying ? " Barbara nodded . For an instant her face quivered , and she looked away from Margaret and then , as though she had become strangely ill and weak , she allowed Margaret to take her arm and lead her across the street where they walked along the hot pavement to the building where the department of social services was housed . The elevator rose to the fifth floor and opened to a corridor of closed doors . There was a torpid stillness in the hall , an out-to-lunch desertion that met them as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently , her mouth trembling , her eyes swimming in tears , and she cried out , " Why are we here ? I do n't know why we 're here . I do know who my real mother is . I 've always known who she was . I know how she looks and what her voice sounds like and how she feels . I do n't know why we came here . I want to go home . Please . " " Who is she ? " Margaret asked softly , her heart beating wildly . " You are , " cried Barbara . " You know you are . " And then Margaret began to cry , tears running down her face while she cried and laughed , putting her out her arms and saying , " You are so impossible , Barbara . You cry at the silliest things . You are just like me . How on earth did you get that way ? " And Barbara stopped crying long enough to say that this was the way it was with mothers and daughters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall . When they were halfway home Margaret said , " Whoever she was she must have been a lovely person to have such a lovely daughter . And surely she loved you or she would n't have given you up . She wanted you to have something she could n't give you , and perhaps that 's all you need to know . " " Yes , " Barbara said , " that will be enough . "
