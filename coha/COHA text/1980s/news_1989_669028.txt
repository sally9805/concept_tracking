This was the moment Mark Green had been waiting for . His first pro football game . In Joe Robbie Stadium , no less , site of last year ' s Super Bowl . And the former Notre Dame running back almost blew it . " Was I nervous ? Oh yeah , " Green said . That ' s probably why on his first play in the second quarter , he blocked a linebacker instead of releasing for a pass . Next play , he got mixed up on his handoff from quarterback Jim McMahon . But then , Green settled down . He scored on a 2-yard run in the Bears ' 28-20 victory over Miami in their preseason opener . This was only an exhibition , but it was real enough for Green . He , rookie Brian Taylor and Curtis Stewart emerged as the leading contenders for the final backfield position . Stewart , a second-year free agent who spent his rookie year on injured reserve with a knee injury , carried twice for 30 yards and caught 3 passes for 26 yards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception for 22 . Taylor had 5 carries for 39 yards , including a 23-yard sprint , while Green carried 10 times for 30 yards and caught a 6-yard pass . Taylor also returned the opening kickoff 38 yards , an indication he could help on the Bears ' special teams . " The touchdown came on a sweep , " Green said of the score that provided the Bears with a 21-0 lead . " I read ( fullback ) Matt Suhey ' s block and turned it outside . It ' s good to know I have the speed to get outside in the pros . " Another rookie who stood out Monday night was linebacker John Roper . The second-round draft choice from Texas A &; had a critical sack at the end of the game that helped subdue a Dolphin rally . Roper ' s sack of backup quarterback Scott Secules was more significant in that the Dolphins didn ' t allow a sack all last season . " I was encouraged by a lot of the young players , " Bears coach Mike Ditka said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scrappy ' ( Stewart ) , he ' s a force . What can I say ? He ' s a tough little kid . On special teams , Taylor , Green . . . I saw a few kids who really hustled . " After his touchdown , Green was greeted at the Bears bench by a wave of high-fives . " It was a really nice feeling for me , " Green said . " There was a feeling that I can play this game . " Second-year safety David Tate came up with an interception , picking up where he left off last year . His four interceptions was second on the Bears behind Vestee Jackson ' s eight . " I rolled to the middle and I don ' t think the quarterback ( Brent Pease ) saw me , " Tate said . " I tried to hide . I like being at the center of activity and I stay there as much as possible . " Two rookies who would just as soon forget this game were cornerback Richard Brothers and quarterback Brent Snyder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20-yard TD pass from quarterback Cliff Stoudt to wide receiver Andre Brown . Snyder ' s first pro pass was intercepted by former Illinois player African Grant . " Brent just overthrew it , " Ditka said . " The guy was open . " Second-year cornerback Lemuel Stinson held his own in filling the void left by Mike Richardson , who signed with the Los Angeles Raiders . " Lemuel was around the ball when he was in there , " safety Dave Duerson said.
