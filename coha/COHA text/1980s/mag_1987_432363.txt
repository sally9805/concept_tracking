 | An international airline ticket also is an entree to some of life 's better bargains ? goods sold in duty-free shops of airports . Forty years after the first store opened at Ireland 's Shannon Airport , the duty-free shop is ubiquitous , some rivaling Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive for luxury or a shopping mall for size . The lure of duty-free goods is that consumers get merchandise free of customs charges in the selling country . Local taxes are often waived as well . A man 's cashmere sweater costing $175 at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam is $210 downtown . A Liberty of London scarf bringing $48 in a London boutique is $36 at Heathrow . A bottle of Courvoisier XO that fetches an astronomical $300 in downtown Tokyo is a mere $59 at Narita Airport . Many travelers assume all duty-free merchandise is a bargain . Not so . " You 'll find plenty of shops in town where Irish products are as cheap as they are here , " admits Liam Skelly , who manages Shannon 's enormous duty-free store . Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the airport goes for half as much in the city . You can buy a Japanese camera in downtown Tokyo for half what you 'd pay at Narita . Intense retail competition sometimes works against the duty-free stores , as in the case of those cameras . In addition , there 's no duty to be waived for goods made in the selling country . Prices also vary from airport to airport : A bottle of Dom Perignon is $41 at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris but $67 at Shannon . Local taxes play a major role in savings . In France , for instance , rebates of the value-added tax ( VAT ) on retail purchases of 1,200 francs or more at one shop may exceed savings at the duty-free counter . Under the French VAT-refund system , you pay full price for your in-town purchases , present the goods for inspection when you leave the country and receive a refund of 13 to 33 percent , depending on the type of goods . This translates to a duty-free price for Petrossian caviar of $85 per 100 grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . The rebate can be in cash on the spot , a check in the mail or a credit-card refund . Loading up on duty-free goods is a privilege generally reserved for departing passengers , so have your ticket handy . Some airports , including Keflavik International in Iceland and Kastrup in Copenhagen , offer shops for arriving passengers as well for those in transit . You may be able to shop while airborne Items bought duty-free are not exempt from duty when they are brought home . U.S. Customs has specific limits on what and how much you may bring back without charges . Certain agricultural products , such as fresh meats , are not permitted . A brochure listing guidelines , " Know Before You Go , " is available from the U.S. Customs Service , P. O. Box 7407 , Washington , D.C. 20044 , or by calling ( 202 ) 566-8195. from duty-free catalogs . Some concessionaires , including those in Bangkok , Karachi and Hong Kong , have opened off-site shops ; passengers with confirmed airline reservations can claim their goods in the departure lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores in Paris , all prices are 25 percent off list . Foreigners leaving the country also can claim a VAT refund . What you should know Most duty-free shops accept several currencies , including U.S. dollars , major credit cards and even personal checks . Ask how to return merchandise should it prove defective . Many products come with worldwide warranties , and most airport shops will accept merchandise returned by mail . Also , with the exception of a few shops that will put your goods on your plane for you , you must be able to carry what you buy . By all accounts , Western Europe is  | prime hunting ground for duty-free bargains . What sets Europe 's airport shops apart are goods made in those countries . Heathrow sells apparel from Burberry , Aquascutum and Dunhill for as little as 40 percent of U.S. prices . Glass merchants will ship Waterford crystal and fine porcelain anywhere in the world , although this entails a 15 percent charge for shipping and insurance . At Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport , departing travelers can roam 23,000 square feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose diamonds , which recently were marked down 30 percent ? with $950 the price for a pair of medium-quality , brilliant-cut stones . As in Tokyo , prices for Japanese cameras or electronic goods are n't necessarily bargains for Americans . Diamonds aside , Schiphol 's best deals remain liquor , cigarettes and perfume . Shelves of the luxurious tax-free shop at Milan 's Linate Airport contain items by Italy 's top fashion designers . Buyers may try on clothing ? a practice discouraged at many airport shops . At the Korean Jindo fur salon in Frankfurt 's Rhine-Main Airport , coats of Blackglama mink sell at big discounts from U.S. prices . The more than 20 boutiques also offer such German products as electric trains , lederhosen and schnapps . Travelers to Paris are advised to steer clear of the dutyfree shops at Charles de Gaulle Airport , where prices often are as high as in town ? but without the bonus of refundable taxes . " De Gaulle is where I shop when I 've forgotten to buy something in town , " says Nora Adler , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strictly last minute . " Asia is less a shopper 's paradise , at least at the airports . Hong Kong is a duty-free port , so Kai Tak Airport 's shops are a poor alternative to the competitive downtown stores . Kai Tak 's big plus is that merchandise is guaranteed to be genuine ? an assurance seldom gotten in the city 's bazaars , where $1.50 fake Lacoste shirts and other ripoffs are common . Certain regional specialties ? pearls at Tokyo 's Narita , ginseng in Seoul and French makeup in Hong Kong ? are reasonably priced . Liquor , highly taxed throughout Asia , is another bargain . " It 's the only way you can afford to drink , " says Mac Jeffrey , a Tokyo-based IBM employe . " I always take in the three-bottle limit . " The U.S. has its share of duty-free bargains and bizarre buys ? though , as elsewhere , you have to be departing the country to become a customer . Surrounded by mirrored walls , shoppers at O'Hare Airport in Chicago can splurge on liquor-filled Swiss chocolates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duty-free shops at Los Angeles International cover more than 7,000 square feet . They sell Gucci wallets for $50 and Lladro porcelain figurines for up to $200 . The age of cheap liquor and cigarettes behind dusty counters has ended . Today 's duty-free shops have the glamour of Fifth Avenue . However , when it comes to prices , many make Americans feel a bit too much at home . m Dubai A great place , for an hour Dubai , United Arab Emirates This may be the last place you 'd want to live . But as many will tell you , it 's a great place to spend an hour : The 22,000-square-foot duty-free spread at this tiny Persian Gulf sheikdom 's airport is a shopper 's paradise . A liter of good Scotch goes for less than $3 , a Rolex Oysterdate for $500 , a mink coat for $1,800 and a half kilo of beluga caviar for $90 . Even better buys are in gold ? an 18-karat chain sells for the price of a 10-karat chain in Manhattan . Little wonder one woman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold chains before boarding a plane . As Dubai is a dutyfree port , you can buy coming and going . There 's a shop in the arrivals terminal . But that terminal is so efficiently run that visitors take just 12 minutes on average clearing immigration and customs ? hardly time to browse . Travelers who pass through Dubai ? about 4 million a year ? generally do so quickly . The deeply discounted items at the airport are part of a plan to make the country more than just a stopover . " We 're cheaper than anyone , " says Colm McLouglin , head of a team of Irishmen from Shannon who setup Dubai 's duty-free complex three years ago . The shops never close ; prices are indeed 10 to 15 percent under most similar stores elsewhere . Sheik Rashid bin Said al-Maktoum and his sons , who rule Dubai , built a $35 million terminal for passengers arriving on Dubai 's international carrier . And there 's a new championship golf course in the Dubai desert , planted in lush Bermuda grass from Georgia .
