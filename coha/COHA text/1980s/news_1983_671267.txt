The show presents about 250 examples of the architect ' s furniture , lighting , fireplace equipment , stained- glass windows , architectural elements , sculpture , drawings and graphics - selections that come from about 75 lenders , assembled by the museum ' s staff and others . Drawings dominate in this presentation which offers new insights into the relationship between Wright ' s designs for the shells of his buildings and the furnishings that filled them during the period covered - from about 1890 to 1930 . On view , too , are some works of his colleagues , including some notable decorative sculptures by Richard Bock and Alsonso Iannelli . The selection and presentation are most impressive. // The variety of Wright ' s designs produced in this period continues to amaze anyone in the field , and for good reason . Most of the chairs , tables , lighting fixtures and stained- glass windows in Wright exhibitions , of which this is the third in New York in a year , were known to most of us only in drawings or photographs . Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side chair from the dining room of his 1908 Robie House in Chicago , a design of raw power that far exceeds anything suggested by the photographs or drawings of that interior . Awesome in its simplicity and bulk , the chair seems much taller than its four-foot , four-inch height. // Another dining-room chair is remarkable for its sculptural strength , thanks to Wright ' s robust interpretation of the hollyhock - the stem of which serves as the spine of the chair , sprouting wood blocks instead of blossoms . The chair is from the 1920 home he did for Aline Barnsdall , a Los Angeles oil heiress , a commission known as the Hollyhock House because its owner insisted that the flower form appear in virtually everything Wright designed for it. // If the variety of decorative designs produced by Wright is surprising , the continuity of themes and techniques is eminently satisfying . The spindles framing his early chairs and tables evolve eventually and harmoniously into squared rods . The cantilever construction of his tables echoes his houses both in the boldness of the visual impact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements was lifelong , showing up , for example in 1901 in the massive spherical cast-iron andirons he did for the E. Arthur Davenport house in River Forest , Ill. , and continuing past his death in 1959 when the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , south of the Cooper-Hewitt on Fifth Avenue , was completed. // // Wright ' s stained-glass designs in the Prairie Houses are more memorable for the bold metal outlines of the motifs incorporated - whether they be geometric abstractions or stylized floral forms - than for their play of colors . One of the most dramatic shown is from the dining room of the 1903 house in Springfield , Ill. , that Wright did for Susan Lawrence Dana , a mining heiress . This is one of Wright ' s richly colored windows , screening out most of the natural light by his generous use of stylized sumac prairie-bush motifs , thereby achieving subdued illumination in that intrerior. // Whatever the inspiration for his stained glass , be it the tree of life or sumac prairie bush , Wright ' s interpretations frequently end up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1912 Avery Coonley Playhouse on view , in which he combined stylized brightly colored balloons , confetti and the American flag , delightful images that recur in this setting and in others , for several decades. // Most of his windows were conceived to let the natural light in , not screen it out , and to blend into the architecture , not upstage it , as do the stained-glass windows of Louis Comfort Tiffany . The motifs Wright incorporated often echo those in the walls and make the glass attractive enough to be left uncurtained , at least by day . This was desirable because the interiors of the architect ' s early houses are dark and he wanted to erase the need for fussy curtains . He was also intent on finding ways to blend the interiors of his houses with the natural settings framing them , a concern that , 40 years later , would tranform the look of houses throughout this country and elsewhere . Wright ' s tree-of-life stained-glass designs for the 1904 Darwin D. Martin house in Buffalo , one of Wright ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Larkin soap company , have been selling for remarkable prices in galleries and at auction in recent months . At Christie ' s in New York in May , a door from that house sold for $110 , 000 , the highest price ever paid at auction for stained glass and for a design by Wright . It was purchased by Max Palevsky , a Los Angeles collector who was until his retirement in the computer business . Mr. Palevsky also bought another door from the Martin house , a geometric design for which he paid $35 , 200 . A third , smaller geometric-patterned door went to the Musee des Artes Decoratifs in Paris for $12 , 100. // Very few important examples of Wright ' s furniture have appeared at auction , and what has come up for bidding has commanded far lower prices . In a Christie ' s May sale there were two offerings : cypress and laminated wood triangular tables from 1939 , one of which sold for $3 , 520 and the other , a pair of slightly smaller designs , standing a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pair . In galleries Wright furniture has carried price tags of from $2 , 000 to $35 , 000. // The period covered will be the subject of a series of lectures at Cooper- Hewitt on Sept. 28 , Oct. 5 , 12 , 19 and 26 by three specialists : Edgar Tafel , an architect ; David Hanks , a dcorative arts consultant , and Roger Kennedy , director of the Smithsonian ' s National Museum of American History . In November , " Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School " ( $13. 95 ) , by H. Allen Brooks , will be published by George Braziller in association with the museum . In the meantime , those interested in Wright ' s interior furnishings might consult Mr. Hanks ' s " The Decorative Designs of Frank Lloyd Wright , " published by Dutton in 1979 , which reviews most of the objects on view. // //
