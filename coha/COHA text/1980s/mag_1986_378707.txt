There has always been some difficulty with the name . An r frequently slides between the last two letters , especially in conversation , the extra letter making him seem like some merry , mischievous , vaguely magical creature out of Tolkien : Geldorf , the elf with the spiritual mission . <P> The real Bob Geldof is , in fact , a fullhearted rock musician with a stalled career and a tempestuous conscience who launched , almost casually , a musical mobilization to aid starving people in Africa . What he pulled off , and what he inspired , still seems something like a fantasy . A single record by a group of British rock stars organized by Geldof under the rubric Band Aid raised $11 million . The Live Aid concert , held in London and Philadelphia the same July day and broadcast live around the world , brought in an additional $72 million . The success of these projects , as well as Geldof s cocky fervor , inspired such allied enterprises as FarmAid , Fashion Aid and  --  in the late spring of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a shower of dollars is required to combat famine . " We could spend our money tomorrow , and it could keep 30 million people alive for seven weeks , " he says , " and then they 'd die . Or , we can build wells and give them a life . I prefer to do that . " <P> His Aid projects worked " beyond my wildest dreams , " but Geldof , 33 , adds , " we wo n't drag on . " He vows that Sport Aid will be his last major fund-raising effort . Now , he feels , " I have to concentrate on making a living . I have to remove myself and distance myself and start to think in a musical frame of mind . " He and his band , the Boomtown Rats , have just completed a mini-tour of Italy .

As a teenager in Dublin , he helped start a chapter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and did community work because " I was never into sports . " But his success at galvanizing a socially somnolent rock community surprised even the organizer . " It went beyond Woodstock , " he says . " It went beyond idealism and that ridiculous term activism , which basically means talking about something but doing nothing . Live Aid was activity as opposed to activism . We made giving exciting . " <P> For his success the rocker who once announced to an indifferent world , " I want to get rich , get famous and get laid , " has been drubbed by several professional relief outfits .
