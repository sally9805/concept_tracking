M I S C E L L A N Y THE AUTUMN OF THE PARTICIPLE Latin writers take a meeting By Peter N. Nelson Aterrible embarrassment occurred at the First South American Writers ' Conference , after the Veloso incident , and after metallic objects had fallen from the face of Colonel Elpidio Aguiar . Colonel Elpidio commanded a small garrison of lepers in the town of Santa Vario dela Sumbra , whose job it was to patrol the vast banana reserves of the interior on donkeyback and make reports on the emotional well-being of the monkeys they found there , their relative happiness a useful economic indicator when plugged into a formula developed by the Ministry of Agriculture so complex that nobody could understand it , until the day a letter came to the colonel 's desk from the minister of information , Admiral Ernesto Valade , summoning the colonel to a large windowless building opposite the presidential palace in Manera . The colonel expected the worst , and even , to curry favor , brought with him his own firing squad of lepers under his command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal environs of Santa Vario dela Sumbra 's banana reserves , depressing because the only way to tell how happy a monkey is is to hold it  --  each time they picked a monkey up , they infected it with leprosy , which saddened the monkeys , hence the dismal performance of the economy , according to the Ministry of Agriculture 's wise and complicated formula , and the colonel was sure he was going to be blamed . Instead , the admiral insisted that the colonel accept a post with the Office of Censorship . The admiral explained that the colonel 's first task would be to host the First South American Writers ' Conference , at the Hotel das Cataratas , by the waterfalls of lguacu . The Ministry of Information had decided that this would be the best way of finding out just who the South American writers were . In the colonel 's counPeter N.

The amendment came as good news to the peasants , mulattoes , Negroes , Indians , and Gypsies , who were so rich in ignorance as to be completely unaware of it , but as bad news to writers and intellectuals , even when the presidente explained that they would be freer than ever to write what they wanted to once reading was a thing of the past . The colonel 's father , Elpidio the Father , called Senhor Elpidio in the town of Bexigador , where the colonel grew up , was one such writer , one who would have been better known if Bexigador had had a postal system , but it did n't , forcing Senhor to send off his manuscripts via messengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes . Admiral Valade remembered the colonel 's father  --  it was why he 'd chosen the colonel to host the conference . Like so many in the civil services , the admiral had been a bandit in his younger days . He remembered robbing messengers in mountain passes and reading stolen manuscripts aloud to fellow bandits at night , when there was nothing better to do than sit around the fire smoking charutos while giant beetles whistled in the arboreal darkness . The colonel 's first task was making sure no two writers who despised each other had adjoining suites or , in extreme cases , to avoid unnecessary sniper fire , rooms opposite each other across the central courtyard , where the hortensia was in blossom and fat red parrots squawked from the jacaranda trees , under which drab brown emus strolled about on spindly legs , snapping at butterflies and chasing away the squirrel-size lizards that basked in the sun beside the spring-fed Olympic-size pool , where there was no swimming because of the piranhas in the spring that fed it . The hotel was a single-story U-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , built in the last Valdeboncouer administration , just before his tragic death , when the seven pistols and three rifles he was cleaning discharged accidentally . Everyone was there . Ezequil Moura Veiga arrived followed by the common housefly that had been buzzing about his ears ever since his wife died of neglect after he crossed the street to buy a paper and never came back . Armindo Viveiros Vargas came with his two wives , Innocencia and Savagine , one of whom he loved , the other not , for one was lovely and one was plain , one passionate and the other frigid , one self-centered and the other generous , even though Innocencia and Savagine were identical twins , joined at the hip from birth . The marriage had been immortalized in Armindo Viveiros Vargas 's tragic prose , for it was the beautiful one who was frigid and self-centered , the ugly one who was passionate and generous , and to make it all the more complicated , Innocencia and Savagine had two hearts but only one circulatory system . The more Armindo loved the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful one , who wished to remain beautiful , wish that Armindo would make love to the ugly one , who wished to become beautiful but could not because Armindo 's loving the ugly one only made the beautiful one more beautiful and irresistible to Armindo , who loved beauty too much to save himself from destroying it . It was heartache upon heartache . He blamed himself , wishing at times for the luxury of simply being followed by a common housefly . The principal speaker , not due until the second day , was Armenio Matos Veloso , the Old Man of the River , for both his refusal to travel any way but by water and his need to urinate frequently . He was the son of the wealthy plantation owner Martin Domingo Veloso , and the great-grandson of Cosimo Veloso , who conquered half the Amazon by merit of his ability toread the local maps , which had north at the bottom and south at the top . Young Armenio grew up privileged , and was sent to Europe for schooling in a Swiss boarding academy where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the school 's number-one discipline problem and a real cutup . The two remained friends into their adult lives , and Armenio even attended the First International at the special invitation of his old bunkie , but eventually had a falling out with Marx over religion , the " opiate of the people . " Armenio taught his literature classes that Marxism is more Christian than capitalism . For a while , Armenio associated in Vienna with a young doctor named Sigmund Freud , a friendship which also ended in a bitter quarrel , Armenio publishing attacks on Freud 's theories , claiming that Freud had not only plagiarized Armenio 's own ideas of the self but had in fact either gotten them backward or inverted them in a crude attempt at concealment , Armenio believing not that we project our deeply hidden fears onto the world but , instead , that we take all that is terrifying about the world and internalize it , for , in Armenio 's own words , " the world and its pain were here long before we were , and will remain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces came to power , Armenio returned to the old Amazon plantation of his birth , where he wrote fabulously magical mystical tales in his solarium and became popular throughout the world , author of over 2,000 novels . He was 166 years old now , and though in perfect health , he slept so soundly that it took a team of registered nurses administering stimulants around the clock days and sometimes even weeks to wake him up , which was why he was going to be late . It was at the opening banquet that the metal objects attached themselves to the colonel 's face , He 'd commented on how few women there were at the conference to one Juan Oscar Mardo , a handsome fellow of considerable commercial success , who 'd complained of the same thing . Juan Oscar said , " Well , after all , if God had meant them to be writers he would have published one by now . " Then he laughed and slapped the colonel on the hack so hard that one of the medals . Admiral Valade had supplied him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocencia Vargas 's decolletage . The situation was quite awkward . When Colonel Elpidio bent toward Innocencia 's cleavage to retrieve his medal , his old ailment reappeared , the medallion flying from between Innocencia 's luscious white breasts and adhering to his forehead with a loud thwack . The colonel had first learned of his condition , a family blood curse that caused his face to become magnetic each time he blushed , as a boy , one beautiful summer evening when he took Serafima the Virgin out behind the gazebo and , in the light of the full moon , as jacanas warbled from the lilies on the pond , lay with her , kissing her until passion swelled in them both , young Elpidio tugging at Serafima 's peasant blouse only to find underneath it something Serafima the Virgin said was a bra . With each passing moment , Elpidio grew more and more certain this thing called a bra was truly designed by the devil , so humiliated was he at his oafish attempts to unfasten it , until his face turned red and became magnetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaving bosom to the end of its chain and nearly put his eye out . " Yeow ! " he cried . Innocencia 's bountiful bust , the one Savagine would sport whenever they exchanged phy-siques , had brought on an attack at a bad mo-ment , for the colonel had only five minutes before he was supposed to deliver the opening address . As he began to speak , he felt the shiny objects tugging at the fabric of his jacket , caus-ing it to pulse noticeably . He might even then have affected a semblance of composure , had Juan Oscar Mardo not started to chuckle at a joke he himself had penned that morning , but the colonel thought they were laughing at him . Soon his face was covered with layers of silver-ware , car keys , paper clips , and assorted cheap irony , until the banquet hall shuddered with peals of laughter , forcing the colonel to retire to his room , feeling his way down the corridor with an outstretched hand . he night was a free-for-all , and not even the emus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made toward anything that moved and much that did n't , until every room in the hotel rang with the bells of desire , save that of Rene Auberge , a structuralist critic from the Sorbonne who 'd been invited to speak on " Absence as Metaphor : Tracings of Signs of Things Vanished , " proposing a new way to read novels by paying special attention to the emblematic nature of elements and motifs not present in them , but had failed to show up , unable to correctly interpret his airline ticket . The only other critic invited was Melinho , from the Man-era Gazette , who had destroyed so many young authors with his scathing reviews that his reputation accorded him the honor of being called by only one name . No sooner had Melinho checked into his room than he encountered a girl from housekeeping named Vulnerabilia the Mute , a child whose wholesome purity was without equal . He dropped his bags and set after her with the unbridled rapacity he usually reserved for tearing apart sentimental first novels , which was how he considered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help , chasing her around the room and out the window into the courtyard willy-nilly beneath the jacarandas until he cornered her at the end of the diving board , three feet above the Olympic-size pool teeming with piranhas . He rubbed his hands together with glee and dove at Vulnerabilia , who sprang straight up from the diving board , Melinho passing beneath her , his arms grasping at an absence Rene Auberge might have found meaningful , and into the pool . There was a horrible splashing and flailing about , until the water turned dark burgundy with blood , and the surface roiled and foamed frothy pink . Then Melinho emerged , climbing up the ladder with a piranha between his teeth , hardly pausing to catch his breath before setting off after Vulnerabilia once again , full speed helter-skelter into the jungle and out of sight . The Old Man of the River arrived the next day , pushed in his wheelchair by his friend , Gargantua the Negro . There was a reception in the lobby for him , and everyone was there except Melinho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing deep into the Amazon basin , discovering regions known only to big oil companies . Armenio Matos Veloso shook hands and told writers , " Hello , I knew your father , " which sent half of his admirers away saying to themselves , " He knew my father ! " and the other half saying , " I must ask him who he was . " The seminar began after lunch . Participants were entertained by an extraordinary band of clams playing accordions , and then Juan Oscar Mardo read from his latest best seller , cut short when members of the audience began to boo and throw money at him , pesos and cruzeiros and liras , until a roll of Guyanese sovereigns caught him square in the temple and knocked him out . He later quipped , " I was greatly affected by sudden change . " Everyone was waiting for Armenio Matos Veloso . When he was introduced , even the clams applauded , and daring young experimentalists fired their revolvers in the air , chameleons on the ceiling notwithstanding , which dropped into untouched fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gargantua wheeled the old man to the dais , Veloso staring straight ahead , but dimly , his eyes clouded with cataracts . A nurse had assured the colonel that all Armenio Matos Veloso needed to rejuvenate him was , as with most writers , an audience . No sooner had Gargantua the Negro lifted the old man and set him before the microphone on the bar stool Colonel Elpidio had found for him than Veloso 's posture straightened , his hands grasping the lectern with a solid purchase . His vision sharpened to the clarity he 'd been famed for , enabling him to observe tumors on the mandibles of passing mosquitoes . His hearing recovered the acuity which had once made him able to tell , from a peasant 's dialect , what direction the bed he was born in had faced . He was known for his transformations  --  once , giving a lecture on narrative technique , he literally turned into a fly on the wall , and buzzed around the room for several minutes before landing in a Venus ' flytrap , from which Gargantua had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his ability to extemporaneously summarize the meaning of life , either for particular individuals or for small groups , something most writers can do , but none with the devastating irony and insight-fulness the Father of South American Literature had built his reputation on , strewing catharsis and epiphany in his wake like a juggernaut . When he finally opened his mouth , everyone was on the edge of his seat . It was quite unexpected , then , when , rather than a stream of words , a trickle of ashes poured from between Armenio Matos Veloso 's lips . It fell onto the podium , forming a small , growing pile , like sand in an hourglass . Some assumed he was up to his old tricks , another eloquent articulation of resounding inscrutability . Slowly , the trickle increased to a cascade of gray residue , billowing out as it collected below , and then the old man began to cough , kicking up clouds of ashes until he let go of the podium , turning his head , spinning on the bar stool , faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the students , nurses , waitresses , busboys , the clams , and the flies on the wall looked on in dismay . It seemed an eternity . Without a word , Gargantua strode to the dais , took the dusty funnel cloud in his huge embrace , arrested it , and carried Armenio Matos Veloso back to his room . It rained all night , winds blustering down out for , then to end up a hollow shell full of ashes took a little of the glamour off it . Savagine and Innocencia even banded together to cheer their husband up , performing 103.5 with him , but to no avail , such was the gloomy pall cast over everyone . The colonel was scheduled to lead conference participants on a tour of the waterfalls the next day , through the 348 separate cataracts that make up Foz do Aguacu , where the broad Piranha River pours over the rim of the central plateau to slake the thirst of the jungle , a thousand feet below . The colors in the chasm were varied and bright , flowering plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue butterflies that lived for only a day , but nothing the colonel pointed out could lift the spirits of the writers who trudged along behind him . At the end of the catwalk was a platform , positioned above the brink of the highest of all the falls , where the river thundered with incredible power into a ravine called the Devil 's Throat . Each writer stood mesmerized by the water rushing all around , each in his heart of hearts trying to suppress the urge he felt to fling himself over the edge and be done with life , an urge all writers feel when taken to high places , something a more experienced writers ' conference organizer might have taken into account . Ezequil Moura Veiga was first , climbing onto the railing with a crazed look in his eyes and jumping . Before the colonel could stop them , the rest followed , in a literary mass suicide the likes of which had n't been seen since Robert Desnos tried to turn a session of automatic writing at Andre Breton 's house into a gang hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan Oscar Mardo , whose pockets were full of money , had enough gravity to fall . The rest simply floated out over the gorge , tumbling head over heels in the updrafts , pitching and yowling , scratching and clawing and climbing over each other , drifting away in the gentle breeze . The colonel became magnetic all over again , and was soon covered with beer cans and lens caps dropped off the platform into the water over the years , magnetic enough to affect the internal navigation of a chevron of migrating geese , high overhead , as well as to disrupt a wide band of radio frequencies , including the one Admiral Valade was using to direct the helicopter pilots who had been summoned to collect the floating writers in volleyball nets borrowed from the hotel , the pilots billing the government a thousand dollars an hour at a time when the exchange rate was soaring , and the leprous monkeys of Santa Vario dela Sumbra held their hairless bellies from hunger , howling plaintive laments in the steamy jungle nights . ?     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
