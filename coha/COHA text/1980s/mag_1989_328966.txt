In 1986 Paula Sims said her 13-day-old daughter Loralei had been abducted from her Brighton , Ill. , home by a man wearing gloves , a ski mask and a dark T shirt and carrying a gray revolver . Police who later found Loralei 's body in a wood near the house were suspicious , but could find no evidence to disprove the story . But when Paula , now living in Alton , Ill. , told police there last April 29 that her second daughter , six-week-old Heather , had also been kidnaped by a man wearing gloves , a ski mask and a dark T shirt and carrying a gray revolver , she stretched credibility too far . Alton police contacted Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom , who had investigated Loralei 's death , and he pronounced himself " flabbergasted  --  I could n't believe it had happened again . " <P> But this time there were clues . Heather 's body turned up in a plastic garbage bag that apparently came from a roll found in the Simses ' Alton home . An autopsy showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a hair sample was discovered in a deep freezer in the house of Paula 's parents , where she and husband Robert had been staying . Paula was indicted on charges of concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in both cases . Last week a grand jury added charges of murdering Heather . No action was taken against Robert , but police consider him a suspect . Seventeen-month-old Randy Sims did not share the terrible fate of his sisters ; he was perfectly healthy when taken into protective custody in May .
