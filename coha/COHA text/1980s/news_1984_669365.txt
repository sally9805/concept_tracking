Do-it-yourself financial planning isn ' t exactly like painting your house or scooting under the car to change the oil . It takes a lot of pencil scratching and rummaging through financial records . It means sitting down and thinking about goals . And like the paint job , you have to be careful , but the process will teach you something - and many times will save you money. // ' ' Chances are , if you ' ve done this ( analyzed your own finances ) , you ' ll know a lot more about yourself - and you may find you can solve your own ( investment ) problems , ' ' says Thomas Porter , author of the ' ' Touche Ross Guide to Personal Financial Management ' ' ( Prentice- Hall , Englewood Cliffs , N.J. $19. 95 ) ' ' Or if you use advisers , ' ' he adds , ' ' you ' ll be able to use them more cost effectively. ' ' // There are plenty of financial planning tools around . Bookstores are stacked with manuals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some magazines and newspapers devote themselves to the subject . Community colleges and adult education centers are jumping at the demand and offering personal finance classes. // Professionals in the field - but not financial planners - say there ' s another good reason to take the self-help approach . ' ' Anyone can put an ad in the paper or hang out a shingle and call themselves a financial planner , ' ' warns Timothy Sullivan , chairman of the finance department at Bentley College in Waltham , Mass . There are no federal requirements for becoming a financial planner , although certified financial planners ( CFPs ) are graduates of the College for Financial Planning in Denver. // Personal money management works in stages . It begins with gathering data about yourself : Finding out how much and where you ' ve been spending , saving , and investing , and figuring out your net worth . The second stage is to set goals : the life style you would like to maintain in retirement , provision for your children ' s education , buying a house , reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these steps , because even if you go to a financial planner you will be asked for this information. // Next , it ' s time to fit data and goals together - to analyze your present situation and see how it matches objectives . Then comes strategy : figuring out what percent of income should be invested where , whether it makes sense to borrow to invest , and how much risk you are willing to take . It looks like the whole process is over when the investment transactions actually take place , but because financial needs change throughout a lifetime , it will become necessary to update the plan yearly and maybe make major adjustments three or four times in your life . Because now is the time that most people are doing their taxes and tracing spending , now is the best time to investigate financial planning. // Do-it-yourself financial planning can involve just a few , or all , of these stages . Guidebooks on personal finance help with data gathering and goal setting , walking you step by step through various forms that take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to explaining investment goals ( estate planning , tax planning , retirement planning ) and in helping you establish a strategy. // It ' s difficult to assess the savings of self-help financial planning vs. going to an adviser . ' ' In some situations you are saving money and in some you are not . That ' s because there ' s no standard package or fee arrangement ( that planners ) charge , ' ' explains Gary Tagtmeier , an accountant and president of Financial Awareness , a Downers Grove , Ill. , firm that gives financial planning seminars at corporations. // Some financial planners charge by the hour , and their rates are usually comparable to the going rate for local accountants and lawyers ( which can range from around $50 to $250 an hour ) . Other financial planners may charge a set fee for a certain number of sessions , or a fee and then commission on the the investments they recommend . Some offer the planning free of charge and only rely on commissions for income .

The initial stages of putting together your financial profile and assessing goals are not difficult . Advisers may be necessary for more complex planning , the most complex being estate planning. // Financial advisers argue that even if a person is self-motivated and determined to keep up with the latest investments , he or she will still need help . ' ' The financial area has become so dynamic . New products come out constantly , ' ' says Richard Bandfield , director of personal financial planning at Prudential-Bache. // ' ' The trouble is , ' ' he continues , ' ' a person doesn ' t know what they don ' t know . An individual will go ahead on incomplete knowledge . They may not know of a recent case in the courts that has been decided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pru-Bache does not charge for its planning services , but rather relies on commissions . A person using the brokerage house ' s planning services is not obligated to follow through and use Pru-Bache ' s brokerage or insurance services. // Some individuals may not have the ' ' get up and go ' ' for self-help financial planning . For them , there are services like the Pathfinder report of Merrill Lynch . For $250 ( largely tax deductible ) , a person still fills out questionnaires , but the reward is a bound report that summarizes your financial situation and lays out an investment strategy for meeting goals . ( If your goals seem unrealistic , the report tells you and makes alternative suggestions . ) Merrill Lynch advisers are available by phone or in person. // The Pathfinder report usually ' ' doesn ' t make any great revelations ' ' about a person ' s finances , says Jay Rabinowitz , Merrill Lynch vice-president and manager of financial planning , but it ' ' does force people to get organized. ' ' // But for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tagtmeier puts it , financial planning is not that complicated . ' ' What the consumer needs is just some basic explanation of facts and terms . The problem with the financial field is that they have different names for the same types of products . I ' m under the attitude that people can take their own financial planning to the nth degree and get complete diversification at minimum cost just by going through a no-load mutual fund. ' ' // Whether you choose to stick to planning basics or map out your own investment strategy , you still get a financial education from the process . That itself is valuable , Tagtmeier says , because ' ' a consumer should never put money in an investment that he doesn ' t understand. ' ' // //
