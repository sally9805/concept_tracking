THOMAS HARRISStarling was enjoying the use for one day of an FBI motor pool Plymouth with a cellular telephone , and she had a new ID card provided by Crawford . It simply said FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR  --  and expired in a week , she noticed . Their destination was Split City Mini-Storage , about four miles past the city limits . Creeping along with the traffic , Starlingused her telephone to find out what she could about the storage facility . By the time she spotted the high orange sign , SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE  --  YOU KEEP THE KEY , she had learned a few facts . Split City had an Interstate Commerce Commission **25;16228;TOOLONG , in the name of Bernard Gary . A federal grand jury had barely missed Gary for interstate transportation of stolen goods three years ago , and his license was up for review . Yow turned in beneath the sign and showed his keys to a spotty young man in uniform at the gate . The gatekeeper logged their license numbers , opened up and beckoned impatiently , as though he had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the wind blows through . Like the Sunday divorce flight from La Guardia to Juarez , it is a service industry to the mindless Brownian movement in our population ; most of its business is storing the sundered chattels of divorce . Its units are stacked with living room suites , breakfast ensembles , spotted mattresses , toys , and the photographs of things that did n't work out . It is widely believed among BaltimoreCounty sheriff 's officers that Split City also hides good and valuable consideration from the bankruptcy courts . It resembles a military installation : thirty acres of long buildingsdivided by fire walls into units the size of a generous single garage , each with its roll-up overhead door . The rates are reasonableand some of the property has been there for years . Security is good . The place is surrounded by a double row of high hurricane fence , and dogs patrol between the fences twenty-four hours a day . Six inches of sodden leaves . mixed with oaoer curs and smallTHE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 41trash , had banked against the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hefty padlock secured each side of the door . The left-side hasp also had a seal on it . Everett Yow bent stiffly over the seal . Starling held the umbrella and a flashlightin the early dark . " It does n't appear to have been opened since I was here five years ago , " he said . " You see the impression of my notary seal here in the plastic . I had no idea at the time that the relatives would be so contentious and would drag out the probate for so many years . " Yow held the flashlight and umbrella while Starling took a picture of the lock and seal . " Mr. Raspail had an office-studio in the city , which I closed down to save the estate from paying rent , " he said . " I had the furnishings brought here and stored them with Raspail 's car and other things that were already here . We brought an upright piano , books and music , a bed , I think . " Yow tried a key . " The locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff . " It was hard for him to bend over and breathe at the same time . When he tried to squat , his knees creaked . Starling was glad to see that the padlocks were big chrome American Standards . They looked formidable , but she knew she could pop the brass cylinders out easily with a sheet metal screw and a claw hammer  --  her father had showed her how burglars do it when she was a child . The problem would be finding the hammer and screw ; she did not even have the benefit of the resident junk in her Pinto . She poked through her purse and found the de-icer spray she used on her Pinto 's door locks . " Want to rest a second in your car , Mr. Yow ? Why do n't you warm up for a few minutes and I 'll give this a try . Take the umbrella , it 's only a drizzle now . " Starling moved the FBI Plymouth up close to the door to use its headlights . She pulled the dipstick out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then sprayed in de-icer to thin the oil . Mr. Yow smiled and nodded from his car . Starling42 THOMAS HARRISwas glad Yow was an intelligent man ; she could perform her task without alienating him . It was dark now . She felt exposed in the glare of the Plymouth'sheadlights and the fan belt squealed in her ear as the car idled . She 'd locked the car while it was running . Mr. Yow appeared to be harmless , but she saw no reason to take a chance on being mashed against the door . The padlock jumped like a frog in her hand and lay there open , heavy and greasy . The other lock , having soaked , was easier . The door would not come up . Starling lifted on the handle until bright spots danced before her eyes . Yow came to help , but between the small , inadequate door handle and his hernia , they exerted little additional force . " We might return next week , with my son , or with some workmen , " Mr. Yow suggested . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starling was not at all sure she 'd ever get back to this place ; it would be less trouble to Crawford if he just picked up the telephone and had the Baltimore field office handle it . " Mr. Yow , I 'll hurry . Do you have a bumper jack in this car ? " With the jack under the handle of the door , Starling used her weight on top of the lug wrench that served as a jack handle . The door squealed horribly and went up a half-inch . It appeared to be bending upward in the center . The door went up another inch and another until she could slide the spare tire under it , to hold it up while she moved Mr. Yow 's jack and her own to the sides of the door , placing them under the bottom edge , close to the tracks the door ran in . Alternating at the jacks on each side , she inched the door up a foot and a half , where it jammed solidly and her full weight on the jack handles would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with her . He could only bend over for a few seconds at a time . " It smells like mice in there , " he said . " I was assured they used rodent poison here . I believe it is specified in the contract . RoTHESILENCE OF THI ! LAMBS 43dents are almost unknown , they said . But I hear them , do you ? " " 1 hear them , " Starling said . With her flashlight , she could pick out cardboard boxes and one big tire with a wide whitewall beneath the edge of a cloth cover . The tire was flat . She backed the Plymouth up until part of the headlight patternshone under the door , and she took out one of the rubber floor mats . " You 're going in there , Officer Starling ? " " I have to take a look , Mr. Yow . " He took out his handkerchief . " May I suggest you tie your cuffs snugly around your ankles ? To prevent mouse intrusion . " " Thank you , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the door should come down , ha ha , or something else should occur , would you be kind enough to call this number ? It 's our Baltimorefield office . They know I 'm here with you right now , and they 'll be alarmed if they do n't hear from me in a little while , do you follow me ? " " Yes , of course . Absolutely , I do . " He gave her the key to the Packard . Starling put the rubber mat on the wet ground in front of the door and lay down on it , her hand cupping a pack of plastic evidence bags over the lens of her camera and her cuffs tied snugly with Yow 's handkerchief and her own . A mist of rain fell in her face , and the smell of mold and mice was strong in her nose . What occurred to Starling was , absurdly , Latin . Written on the blackboard by her forensics instructor on her first day in training , it was the motto of the Roman physician : Primum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say that in a garage full of fucking mice . And suddenly her father 's voice , speaking to her with his hand on her brother 's shoulder , " If you ca n't play without squawling , Clarice , go on to the house . " Starling fastened the collar button of her blouse , scrunched her shoulders up around her neck and slid under the door . She was beneath the rear of the Packard . It was parked close to the left side of the storage room , almost touching the wall. 44 THOMAS HARRISCardboard boxes were stacked high on the right side of the room , filling the space beside the car . Starling wriggled along on her back until her head was out in the narrow gap left between the car and the boxes . She shined her flashlight up the cliff face of boxes . Many spiders had spanned the narrow space with their webs . Orb weavers , mostly , the webs dotted with small shriveledcarcasses tightly bound . Well , a brown recluse spider is the only kind to worry about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starling said to herself . The rest do n't raise much of a welt . There would be space to stand beside the rear fender . She wriggled around until she was out from under the car , her face close beside the wide whitewall tire . It was hatched with dry rot . She could read the words GOODYEAR DOUBLE EAGLE on it . Careful of her head , she got to her feet in the narrow space , hand before her face to break the webs . Was this how it felt to wear a veil ? Mr. Yow 's voice from outside . " Okay , Miss Starling ? " " Okay , " she said . There were small scurryings at the sound of her voice , and something inside a piano climbed over a few high notes . The car lights from outside lit her legs up to the calf . " So you found the piano , Officer Starling , " Mr. Yow called . " That was n't me . " " Oh . " The car was big , tall and long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was covered with a rug , the plush side down . She played her flashlight over it . " Did you cover the car with this rug , Mr. Yow ? " " I found it that way and I never uncovered it , " Yow called under the door . " I ca n't deal with a dusty rug . That 's the way Raspail had it . I just made sure the car was there . My movers put the piano against the wall and covered it and stacked more boxes beside the car and left . I was paying them by the hour . The boxes are sheet music and books , mostly . " The rug was thick and heavy and as she tugged at it , dust swarmed in the beam of her flashlight . She sneezed twice . Standing on tiptoe , she could fold the rug over to the midlineTII H ti11.HNCH OF TII H IAMBS 45of the tall old car . The curtains were drawn in the back windows . The door handle was covered with dust . She had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the handle , she tried to turn it downward . Locked . There was no keyhole in the rear door . She 'd have to move a lot of boxes to get to the front door , and there was damn little place to put them . She could see a small gap between the curtain and the post of the rear window . Starling leaned over boxes to put her eye close to the glass and shined her light through the crack . She could only see her reflectionuntil she cupped her hand on top of the light . A splinter of the beam , diffused by the dusty glass , moved across the seat . An album lay open on the seat . The colors were poor in the bad light , but she could see Valentines pasted on the pages . Lacy old Valentines , fluffy on the page . " Thanks a lot , Dr. Lecter . " When she spoke , her breath stirred the fuzz of dust on the windowsill and fogged the glass . She did n't want to wipe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light moved on , over a lap rug crumpled on the floor of the car and onto the dusty wink of a pair of man 's patent leather evening shoes . Above the shoes , black socks and above the socks were tuxedo trousers with legs in them . Nobody ' **26;16255;TOOLONG  --  easy , easy , hold it baby . " Oh , Mr. Yow . Say , Mr. Yow ? " " Yes , Officer Starling ? " " Mr. Yow , looks like somebody 's sitting in this car . " " Oh my . Maybe you better come out , Miss Starling . " " Not quite yet , Mr. Yow . Just wait there , if you will , please . " Now is when it 's important to think . Now is more important than all the crap you tell your pillow for the rest of your life . Suck it up and do this right . I do n't want to destroy evidence . I do want some help . But most of all I do n't want to cry wolf If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing , I 've had it . I see what looks like some legs . Mr. Yow would not have brought me here if he 'd known there was a cool one in the car . She managed to smile at herself . " Cool one " was bravado . Nobody 's been here since Yow " s last visit . All right , that means the boxes were put here after whatever's46 THOMAS HARRISin the car . And that means I can move the boxes without losing anything important . " All right , Mr. Yow . " " Yes . Do we have to call the police , or are you sufficient , Officer Starling ? " " I 've got to find that out . Just wait right there , please . " The box problem was as maddening as Rubik 's Cube . She tried to work with the flashlight under her arm , dropped it twice , and finally put it on top of the car . She had to put boxes behind her , and some of the shorter book cartons would slide under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball of her thumb itch . Now she could see through the dusty glass of the front passenger'sside window into the chauffeur 's compartment . A spiderhad spun between the big steering wheel and the gearshift . The partition between the front and back compartments was closed . She wished she had thought to oil the Packard key before she came under the door , but when she stuck it in the lock , it worked . There was hardly room to open the door more than a third of the way in the narrow passage . It swung against the boxes with a thump that sent the mice scratching and brought additional notes from the piano . A stale smell of decay and chemical came out of the car . It jogged her memory in a place she could n't name . She leaned inside , opened the partition behind the chauffeur 's seat , and shined her flashlight into the rear compartment of the car . A formal shirt with studs was the bright thing the light found first , quickly up the shirtfront to the face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering shirt studs and satin lapels to a lap with zipper open , and up again to the neat bow tie and the collar , where the white stub neck of a mannequin protruded . But above the neck , something else that reflected little light . Cloth , a black hood where the head should be , big , as though it covered a parrot 's cage . Velvet , Starling thought . It sat on a THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 47plywood shelf extending over the neck of the mannequin from the parcel shelf behind . She took several pictures from the front seat , focusing with the flashlight and closing her eyes against the flash of the strobe . Then she straightened up outside the car . Standing in the dark , wet , with cobwebs on her , she considered what to do . What she was not going to do was summon the special agent in charge of the Baltimore field office to look at a mannequin with its fly open and a book of Valentines . Once she decided to get in the backseat and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about it very long . She reached through the chauffeur 's partition , unlocked the rear door , and rearranged some boxes to get it open . It all seemed to take a long time . The smell from the rear compartment was much stronger when she opened the door . She reached in and , carefully lifting the Valentine album by the corners , moved it onto an evidence bag on top of the car . She spread another evidence bag on the seat . The car springs groaned as she got inside and the figure shifted a little when she sat down beside it . The right hand in its white glove slid off the thigh and lay on the seat . She touched the glove with her finger . The hand inside was hard . Gingerly she pushed the glove down from the wrist . The wrist was some white synthetic material . There was a lump in the trousers that for a silly instant reminded her of certain events in high school . Small scrambling noises came from under the seat . Gentle as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved easily over something hard and slick beneath . When she felt the round knob on the top , she knew . She knew that it was a big laboratory specimen jar and she knew what would be in it . With dread , but little doubt , she pulled off the cover . The head inside the jar had been severed neatly close beneath the jaw . It faced her , the eyes long burned milky by the alcohol that preserved it . The mouth was open and the tongue protrudedslightly , very gray . Over the years , the alcohol had evaporated to the point that the head rested on the bottom of48 THOMAS HARRISthe jar , its crown protruding through the surface of the fluid in a cap of decay . Turned at an owlish angle to the body beneath , it gaped stupidly at Starling . Even in the play of light over the features , it remained dumb and dead . Starling , in this moment , examined herself . She was pleased . She was exhilarated . She wondered for a second if those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this old car with a head and some mice , she could think clearly , and she was proud of that . " Well , Toto , " she said , " we 're not in Kansas anymore . " She 'd always wanted to say that under stress , but doing it left her feeling phony , and she was glad nobody had heard . Work to do . She sat back gingerly and looked around . This was somebody 's environment , chosen and created , a thousand light-years across the mind from the traffic crawling down Route 301 . Dried blossoms drooped from the cut-crystal bud vases on the pillars . The limousine 's table was folded down and covered with a linen cloth . On it , a decanter gleamed through dust . A spider had built between the decanter and the short candlestick beside it . She tried to picture Lecter , or someone , sitting here with her present companion and having a drink and trying to show him the Valentines . And what else ? Working carefully , disturbing the figure as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was none . In a jacket pocket she found the bands of material left over from adjusting the length of the trousers  --  the dinner clothes were probably new when they were put on the figure . Starling poked the lump in the trousers . Too hard , even for high school , she reflected . She spread the fly with her fingers and shined her light inside , on a dildo of polished , inlaid wood . Good-sized one , too . She wondered if she was depraved . Carefully she turned the jar and examined the sides and back of the head for wounds . There were none visible . The name of a laboratory supply company was cast in the glass . THB SILBNCB OF THB LAMBS 49Considering the face again , she believed she learned something that would last her . Looking with purpose at this face , with its tongue changing color where it touched the glass , was not as bad as Miggs swallowing his tongue in her dreams . She felt she could look at anything , if she had something positive to do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her WPIK-TV mobile news unit slid to a stop , Jonetta Johnson put in her earrings , powdered her beautiful brown face , and cased the situation . She and her news crew , monitoring the Baltimore County police radio , had arrived at Split City ahead of the patrol cars . All the news crew saw in their headlights was Clarice Starling , standing in front of the garage door with her flashlight and her little laminated ID card , her hair plastered down by the drizzle . Jonetta Johnson could spot a rookie every time . She climbed out with the camera crew behind her and approached Starling . The bright lights came on . Mr. Yow sank so far down in his Buick that only his hat was visible above the window sill . " Jonetta Johnson , WPIK news , did you report a homicide ? " Starling did not look like very much law and she knew it . " I 'm a federal officer , this is a crime scene . I have to secure it until the Baltimore authorities  --  " The assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to lift it . " Hold it , " Starling said . " I 'm talking to you , sir . Hold it . Back off , please . I 'm not kidding with you . Help me out here . " She wished hard for a badge , a uniform , anything . " Okay , Harry , " the newswoman said . " Ah , officer , we want to cooperate in every way . Frankly , this crew costs money and I just want to know whether to even keep them here until the other authorities arrive . Will you tell me if there 's a body in there ? Camera 's off , just between us . Tell me and we 'll wait . We 'll be good , I promise . How about it ? " 50 THOMAS HARRIS " I 'd wait if I were you , " Starling said . " Thanks , you wo n't be sorry , " Jonetta Johnson said . " Look , I 've got some information on Split City Mini-Storage that you could probably use . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I can find it here . " " WEYE mobile unit just turned in at the gate , Joney , " the man , Harry , said . " Let 's see if I can find it here , Officer , here it is . There was a scandal about two years ago when they tried to prove this place was trucking and storing  --  was it fireworks ? " Jonetta Johnson glanced over Starling 's shoulder once too often . Starling turned to see the cameraman on his back , his head and shoulders in the garage , the assistant squatting beside him , ready to pass the minicam under the door . " Hey ! " Starling said . She dropped to her knees on the wet ground beside him and tugged at his shirt . " You ca n't go in there . Hey ! I told you not to do that . " And all the time the men were talking to her , constantly , gently . " We wo n't touch anything . We 're pros , you do n't have to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , honey . " Their cozening backseat manner put her over . She ran to a bumper jack at the end of the door and pumped the handle . The door came down two inches , with a grinding screech . She pumped it again . Now the door was touching the man 's chest . When he did n't come out , she pulled the handle out of the socket and carried it back to the prone cameraman . There were other bright television lights now , and in the glare of them she banged the door above him hard with the jack handle , showering dust and rust down on him . " Give me your attention , " she said . " You do n't listen , do you ? Come out of there . Now . You 're one second from arrest for obstruction of justice . " " Take it easy , " the assistant said . He put his hand on her . She turned on him . There were shouted questions from behind the glare and she heard sirens . TIFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back off , buster . " She stood on the cameraman'sankle and faced the assistant , the jack handle hanging by her side . She did not raise the jack handle . It was just as well . She looked bad enough on television as it was . CHAPTER 9The odors of the violent ward seemed more intense in the semidarkness . A TV set playingwithout sound in the corridor threw Starling 's shadow on the bars of Dr. Lecter 's cage . She could not see into the dark behind the bars , but she did n't ask the orderly to turn up the lights from his station . The whole ward would light at once and she knew the Baltimore County police had had the lights full on for hours while they shouted questions at Lecter . He had refused to speak , but responded by folding for them an origami chicken that pecked when the tail was manipulated up and down . The senior officer , furious , had crushed the chicken in the lobby ashtray as he gestured for Starling to go in . " Dr. Lecter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall , but from Miggs ' empty cell , no breathing . Miggs ' cell was vastly empty . She felt its silence like a draft . Starling knew Lecter was watching her from the darkness . Two minutes passed . Her legs and back ached from her struggle with the garage door , and her clothes were damp . She sat on her coat on the floor , well back from the bars , her feet tucked under52TH8 SILENCE OP THE LAMES 53her , and lifted her wet , bedraggled hair over her collar to get it off her neck . Behind her on the TV screen , an evangelist waved his arms . " Dr. Lecter , we both know what this is . They think you 'll talk to me . " Silence . Down the hall , someone whistled " Over the Sea to Skye . " After five minutes , she said , " It was strange going in there . Sometime I 'd like to talk to you about it . " Starling jumped when the food carrier rolled out of Lecter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray . She had n't heard him move . She looked at it and , with a sense of falling , took it and toweled her hair . " Thanks , " she said . " Why do n't you ask me about Buffalo Bill ? " His voice was close , at her level . He must be sitting on the floor too . " Do you know something about him ? " " I might if I saw the case . " " I do n't have that case , " Starling said . " You wo n't have this one , either , when they 're through using you . " " I know . " " You could get the files on Buffalo Bill . The reports and the pictures . I 'd like to see it . " 1 ' 11 bet you would . " Dr. Lecter , you started this . Now please tell me about the person in the Packard . " " You found an entire person ? Odd . I only saw a head . Where do you suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was it ? " " What can you tell ? " " They 've only done the preliminary stuff . White male , about twenty-seven , both American and European dentistry . Who was he ? " " Raspail 's lover . Raspail , of the gluey flute . " " What were the circumstances  --  how did he die ? " " Circumlocution , Officer Starling ? " 54 THOMAS HARRIS " No , I 'll ask it later . " " Let me save you some time . I did n't do it ; Raspail did . Raspail liked sailors . This was a Scandinavian one named Klaus something . Raspail never told me the last name . " Dr. Lecter 's voice moved lower . Maybe he was lying on the floor , Starling thought . " Klaus was off a Swedish boat in San Diego . Raspail was out there teaching for a summer at the conservatory . He went berserkover the young man . The Swede saw a good thing and jumped his boat . They bought some kind of awful camper and sylphed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfaithful and he strangled him . " " Raspail told you this ? " " Oh yes , under the confidential seal of therapy sessions . I think it was a lie . Raspail always embellished the facts . He wanted to seem dangerous and romantic . The Swede probably died in some banal erotic asphyxia transaction . Raspail was too flabby and weak to have strangled him . Notice how closely Klaus was trimmed under tire jaw ? Probably to remove a high ligature mark from hanging . " " I see . " " Raspail 's dream of happiness was ruined . He put Klaus ' head in a bowling bag and came back East . " " What did he do with the rest ? " " Buried it in the hills . " " He showed you the head in the car ? " " Oh yes , in the course of therapy he came to feel he could tell me anything . He went out to sit with Klaus quite often and showed him the Valentines . " " And then Raspail himself . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and tired of his whining . Best thing for him , really . Therapy was n't going anywhere . I expect most psychiatristshave a patient or two they 'd like to refer to me . I 've never discussed this before , and now I 'm getting bored with it . " " And your dinner for the orchestra officials . " " Have n't you ever had people coming over and no time to THE SILENCE OP THE LAMBS 55shop ? You have to make do with what 's in the fridge , Clarice . May I call you Clarice ? " " Yes . I think I 'll just call you  --  " " Dr. Lecter  --  that seems most appropriate to your age and station , " he said . " Yes . " " How did you feel when you went into the garage ? " " Apprehensive . " " Why ? " ? " Mice and insects . " " Do you have something you use when you want to get up your nerve ? " Dr. Lecter asked . " Nothing I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do memories or tableaux occur to you then , whether you try for them or not ? " " Maybe . I have n't thought about it . " " Things from your early life . " " I 'll have to watch and see . " " How did you feel when you heard about my late neighbor , Miggs ? You have n't asked me about it . " " I was getting to it . " " Were n't you glad when you heard ? " " No . " " Were you sad ? " " No . Did you talk him into it ? " Dr. Lecter laughed quietly . " Are you asking me , Officer Starling , if I suborned Mr. Miggs ' felony suicide ? Do n't be silly . It has a certain pleasant symmetry , though , his swallowing that offensivetongue , do n't you agree ? " " No . " " Officer Starling , that was a lie . The first one you 've told me . A triste occasion , Truman would say . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I helped you ? " " I do n't know . " 56 THOMAS HARRIS " Jack Crawford likes you , does n't he ? " " I do n't know . " " That 's probably untrue . Would you like for him to like you ? Tell me , do you feel an urge to please him and does it worry you ? Are you wary of your urge to please him ? " " Everyone wants to be liked , Dr. Lecter . " " Not everyone . Do you think Jack Crawford wants you sexually ? I 'm sure he 's very frustrated now . Do you think he visualizes. . . scenarios , transactions . . . fucking with you ? " " That 's not a matter of curiosity to me , Dr. Lecter , and it 's the sort of thing Miggs would ask . " " Not anymore . " " Did you suggest to him that he swallow his tongue ? " " Your interrogative case often has that proper subjunctive in it . With your accent , it stinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you competent . Surely the odd confluence of events has n't escaped you , Clarice  --  you 've had Crawford 's help and you 've had mine . You say you do n't know why Crawford helps you  --  do you know why I did ? " " No , tell me . " " Do you think it 's because I like to look at you and think about eating you up  --  about how you would taste ? " " Is that it ? " " No . I want something Crawford can give me and I want to trade him for it . But he wo n't come to see me . He wo n't ask for my help with Buffalo Bill , even though he knows it means more young women will die . " " I ca n't believe that , Dr. Lecter . " " I only want something very simple , and he could get it . " Lecter turned up the rheostat slowly in his cell . His books and drawings were gone . His toilet seat was gone . Chilton had stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in this room eight years , Clarice . I know that they will never , ever let me out while I 'm alive . What I want is a view .

As soon as you leave the orderly will turn the sound back up , and my attorney ca n't stop it , the way the court is inclined toward me now . I want to be in a federal institution and I want my books back and a view . I 'll give good value for it . Crawford could do that . Ask him . " " I can tell him what you 've said .

" " Yes ? " " Buffalo Bill has a two-story house , " Dr. Lecter said , and turned out his light . He would not speak again . CHAPTER 10Clarice Starling leaned against a dice table in the FBI 's casinoand tried to pay attention to a lecture on money-laundering in gambling . It had been thirty-six hours since the Baltimore County police took her deposition ( via a chain-smoking two-finger typist : " See if you can get that window open if the smoke bothers you . " ) and dismissed her from its jurisdiction with a reminder that murder is not a federal crime . The network news on Sunday night showed Starling 's scrap with the television cameramen and she felt sure she was deep in the glue . Through it all , no word from Crawford or from the Baltimore field office . It was as though she had dropped her report down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small  --  it had operated in a moving trailer truck until the FBI seized it and installed it in the school as a teaching aid . The narrow room was crowded with police from many jurisdictions ; Starling had declined with thanks the chairs of two Texas Rangers and a Scotland Yard detective . The rest of her class were down the hall in the Academy building , searching for hairs in the genuine motel carpet of the58THE SII.FNCE OF THE LAMBS 59 " Sex-Crime Bedroom " and dusting the " Anytown Bank " for fingerprints . Starling had spent so many hours on searches and fingerprints as a Forensic Fellow that she was sent instead to this lecture , part of a series for visiting lawmen . She wondered if there was another reason she had been separatedfrom the class : maybe they isolate you before you get the ax . Starling rested her elbows on the pass line of the dice table and tried to concentrate on money-laundering in gambling . What she thought about instead was how much the FBI hates to see its agents on television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catnip to the media , and the Baltimorepolice had happily supplied Starling 's name to reporters . Over and over she saw herself on the Sunday-night network news . There was " Starling of the FBI " in Baltimore , banging the jack handle against the garage door as the cameraman tried to slither under it . And here was " Federal Agent Starling " turning on the assistant with the jack handle in her hand . On the rival network , station WPIK , lacking film of its own , had announced a personal-injury lawsuit against " Starling of the FBI " and the Bureau itself because the cameraman got dirt and rust particles in his eyes when Starling banged the door . Jonetta Johnson of WPIK was on coast-to-coast with the revelationthat Starling had found the remains in the garage through an " eerie bonding with a man authorities have branded ... a monster ! " Clearly , WPIK had a source at the hospital . BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN ! ! screamed the National Tattler from its supermarket racks . There was no public comment from the FBI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . At breakfast , one of her classmates , a young man who wore a lot of Canoe after-shave , had referred to Starling as " Melvin Pelvis , " a stupid play on the name of Melvin Purvis , Hoover 's number-one G-man in the thirties . What Ardelia Mapp said to60 T H O M A S H A R R I Sthe young man made his face turn white , and he left his breakfastuneaten on the table . Now Starling found herself in a curious state in which she could not be surprised . For a day and a night she 'd felt suspended in a diver 's ringing silence . She intended to defend herself , if she got the chance . The lecturer spun the roulette wheel as he talked , but he never let the ball drop . Looking at him , Starling was convinced that he had never let the ball drop in his life . He was saying somethingnow : " Clarice Starling . " Why was he saying " Clarice Starling ? " That 's me . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door behind her . Here it came . Her fate shied under her as she turned to see . But it was Brigham , the gunnery instructor , leaning into the room to point to her across the crowd . When she saw him , he beckoned . For a second she thought they were throwing her out , but that would n't be Brigham 's job . . " Saddle up , Starling . Where 's your field gear ? " he said in the hall . " My room  --  C Wing . " She had to walk fast then to keep up with him . He was carrying the big fingerprint kit from the property room  --  the good one , not the play-school kit  --  and a small canvasbag . " You go with Jack Crawford today . Take stuff for overnight . You may be back , but take it . " " Where ? " " Some duck hunters in West Virginia found a body in the Elk River around daylight . In a Buffalo Bill  --  type situation . Deputies are bringing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not inclined to wait on those guys for details . " Brigham stopped at the door to C Wing . " He needs somebody to help him that can print a floater , among other things . You were a grunt in the lab  --  you can do that , right ? " THB SII.F.NCB OF THE LAMBS 61 " Yeee , let me check the stuff . " Brigham held the fingerprint kit open while Starling lifted out the trays . The fine hypodermics and the vials were there , but the camera was n't . " I need the one-to-one Polaroid , the CU-5 , Mr. Brigham , and film packs and batteries for it . " " From property ? You got it . " He handed her the small canvas bag , and when she felt its weight , she realized why it was Brigham who had come for her . " You do n't have a duty piece yet , right ? " " No . " " You got ta have full kit . This is the rig you 've been wearing on the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same K-frame Smith you 're trained with , but the action 's cleaned up . Dry-fire it in your room tonight when you get the chance . I 'll be in a car behind C Wing in ten minutes flat with the camera . Listen , there 's no head in the Blue Canoe . Go to the bathroom while you 've got the chance is my advice . Chop-chop , Starling . " She tried to ask him a question , but he was leaving her . Has to be Buffalo Bill , if Crawford 's going himself . What the hell is the Blue Canoe ? But you have to think about packing when you pack . Starling packed fast and well . " Is it  --  " " That 's okay , " Brigham interrupted as she got in the car . " The butt prints against your jacket a little if somebody 's looking for it , but it 's okay for now . " She was wearing the snub-nosed revolver under her blazer in a pancake holster snug against her ribs , with a speedloader straddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the base speed limit toward the Quantico airstrip . He cleared his throat . " One good thing about the range , Starling , is there 's no politics out there . " " No ? " " You were right to secure that garage up at Baltimore there . You worried about the TV ? " " Should I be ? " 62 THOMAS HARRIS " We 're talking just us , right ? " " Right . " Brigham returned the greeting of a Marine directing traffic . " Taking you along today , Jack 's showing confidence in you where nobody can miss it , " he said . " In case , say , somebody in the Office of Professional Responsibility has your jacket in front of him and his bowels in an uproar , understand what I 'm telling you ? " " Ummm . " " Crawford 's a stand-up guy . He made it clear where it matters that you had to secure the scene . He let you go in there bare  --  that is , bare of all your visible symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response time of the Baltimore cops was pretty slow . Also , Crawford needs the help today , and he 'd have to wait an hour for Jimmy Price to get somebody here from the lab . So you got it cut out for you , Starling . A floater 's no day at the beach , either . It 's not punishment for you , but if somebody outside needed to see it that way , they could . See , Crawford is a very subtle guy , but he 's not inclined to explain things , that 's why I 'm telling you . . . . If you 're working with Crawford , you should know what the deal is with him  --  do you know ? " " I really do n't . " " He 's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill . His wife Bella 's real sick . She 's . . . in a terminal situation . He 's keeping her at home . If it was n't for Buffalo Bill , he 'd have taken compassionateleave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not discussed . Do n't tell him you 're sorry or anything , it does n't help him . . . they had a good time . " " I 'm glad you told me . " Brigham brightened as they reached the airstrip . " I 've got a couple of important speeches I give at the end of the firearms course , Starling , try not to miss them . " He took a shortcut betweensome hangars . " I will . " " Listen , what I teach is something you probably wo n't ever have to do . I hope you wo n't . But you 've got some aptitude , THE SILENCF . OF 1'HF . LAMBS 63Starling . If you have to shoot , you can shoot . Do your exer-cises . " " Right . " " Do n't ever put it in your purse . " " Right . " " Pull it a few times in your room at night . Stay so you can find it . " " I will . " A venerable twin-engined Beechcraft stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door open . One propeller was spinning , riffling the grass beside the tarmac . " That would n't be the Blue Canoe , " Starling said . Yep . " It 's little and it 's old . " " It is old , " Brigham said cheerfully . " Drug Enforcement seized it in Florida a long time ago , when it flopped in the ' Glades . Mechanically sound now , though . I hope Gramm and Rudman do n't find out we 're using it  --  we 're supposed to ride the bus . " He pulled up beside the airplane and got Starling 's baggage out of the backseat . In some confusion of hands he managed to give her the stuff and shake her hand . And then , without meaning to , Brigham said , " Bless you , Starling . " The words felt odd in his Marine mouth . He did n't know where they came from and his face felt hot . " Thanks . . . thank you , Mr. Brigham . " Crawford was in the copilot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starling when he heard the pilot slam the door . She could n't see his eyes behind the dark glasses , and she felt she did n't know him . Crawford looked pale and tough , like a root a bulldozer pushes up . " Take a pew and read , " is all he said . A thick case file lay on the seat behind him . The cover said BUFFALO BILL . Starling hugged it tight as the Blue Canoe blatted and shuddered and began to roll . CHAPTER 11The edges of the runway blurred and fell away . To the east , a flash of morning sunoff the Chesapeake Bay as the small plane turned out of traffic . Clarice Starling could see the school down there , and the surrounding Marine base at Quantico . On the assault course , tiny figures of Marines scrambled and ran . This was how it looked from above . Once after a night-firing exercise , walking in the dark along the deserted Hogan 's Alley , walking to think , she had heard airplanes roar over and then , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her  --  airborne troops in a night jump calling to each other as they came down through the darkness . And she wondered how it felt to wait for the jump light at the aircraft door , how it felt to plunge into the bellowing dark . Maybe it felt like this . She opened the file . He had done it five times that they knew of , had Bill . At least five times , and probably more , over the past ten months he had abducted a woman , killed her and skinned her . ( Starling 's eye raced down the autopsy protocols to the free histamine tests to confirm that he killed them before he did the rest. ) 641 I I F S I I . F N C F OF THE LAMBS 65He dumped each body in running water when he was through with it . Each was found in a different river , downstream from an interstate highway crossing , each in a different state . Everyoneknew Buffalo Bill was a traveling man . That was all the law knew about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gun . It had six lands and grooves , left-hand twist  --  possibly a Colt revolver or a Colt clone . Skidmarks on recovered bullets indicated he preferred to fire .38 Specials in the longer chambers of a .357 . The rivers left no fingerprints , no trace evidence of hair or fiber . He was almost certain to be a white male : white because serial murderers usually kill within their own ethnic group and all the victims were white ; male because female serial murderers are almost unknown in our time . Two big-city columnists had found a headline in e.e . Cummings ' deadly little poem " Buffalo Bill " : . . . how do you like your blueeyed boy Mister DeathSomeone , maybe Crawford , had pasted the quotation inside the cover of the file . There was no clear correlation between where Bill abducted the young women and where he dumped them . In the cases where the bodies were found soon enough for an accurate determination of time of death , police learned another thing the killer did : Bill kept them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a week to ten days after they were abducted . That meant he had to have a place to keep them and a place to work in privacy . It meant he was n't a drifter . He was more of a trapdoor spider . With his own digs . Somewhere . That horrified the public more than anything  --  his holding them for a week or more , knowing he would kill them . Two were hanged , three shot . There was no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death , and the autopsy protocols recorded no evidence of " specifically genital " disfigurement , though pathologists noted it would be almost impossible to determine these things in the more deteriorated bodies. 66 THOMAS H A R R I SAll were found naked . In two cases , articles of the victims ' outer clothing were found beside the road near their homes , slit up the back like funeral suits . Starling got through the photographs all right . Floaters are the worst kind of dead to deal with , physically . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about homicide victims out of doors . The indignities the victim suffers , the exposure to the elements and to casual eyes , anger you if your job permits you anger . Often , at indoor homicides , evidences of a victim 's unpleasant personal practices , and the victim 's own victims  --  beaten spouses , abused children  --  crowd around to whisper that the dead one had it coming , and many times he did . But nobody had this coming . Here they had not even their skins as they lay on littered riverbanks amid the outboard-oil bottles and sandwich bags that are our common squalor . The cold-weather ones largely retained their faces . Starling remindedherself that their teeth were not bared in pain , that turtles and fish in the course of feeding had created that expression . Bill peeled the torsos and mostly left the limbs alone . They would n't have been so hard to look at , Starling thought , if this airplane cabin was n't so warm and if the damned plane did n't have this crawly yaw as one prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the God damned sun did n't splinter so on the scratched windows and jab like a headache . It 's possible to catch him . Starling squeezed on that thought to help herself sit in this ever-smaller airplane cabin with her lap full of awful information . She could help stop him cold . Then they could put this slightly sticky , smooth-covered file back in the drawer and turn the key on it . She stared at the back of Crawford 's head . If she wanted to stop Buffalo Bill she was in the right crowd . Crawford had organized successful hunts for three serial murderers . But not without casualties . Will Graham , the keenest hound ever to run in Crawford 's pack , was a legend at the Academy ; he was alsoTHE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 67a drunk in Florida now with a face that was hard to look at , they said . Maybe Crawford felt her staring at the back of his head . He climbed out of the copilot 's seat . The pilot touched the trim wheel as Crawford came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his sunglasses and put on his bifocals , she felt she knew him again . When he looked from her face to the report and back again , something passed behind his face and was quickly gone . A more animated mug than Crawford 's would have shown regret . " I 'm hot , are you hot ? " he said . " Bobby , it 's too damned hot in here , " he called to the pilot . Bobby adjusted something and cold air came in . A few snowflakes formed in the moist cabin air and settled in Starling 's hair . Then it was Jack Crawford hunting , his eyes like a bright winter day . He opened the file to a map of the Central and Eastern United States . Locations where bodies had been found were marked on the map  --  a scattering of dots as mute and crooked as Orion . Crawford took a pen from his pocket and marked the newest location , their objective . " Elk River , about six miles below U.S. 79 , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was snagged on a trotline  --  a fishing line set out in the river . They do n't think she 's been in the water all that long . They 're bringing her to Potter , the county seat . I want to know who she is in a hurry so we can sweep for witnessesto the abduction . We 'll send the prints back on a land line as soon as we get ' em . " Crawford tilted his head to look at Starling through the bottoms of his glasses . " Jimmy Price says you can do a floater . " " Actually , I never had an entire floater , " Starling said . " I fingerprinted the hands Mr. Price got in his mail every day . A good many of them were from floaters , though . " Those who have never been under Jimmy Price 's supervision believe him to be a lovable curmudgeon . Like most curmudgeons , he is really a mean old man . Jimmy Price is a supervisor0o THOMAS HARRISin Latent Prints at the Washington lab . Starling did time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Crawford said fondly . " What is it they call that job ... " " The position is called ' lab wretch , ' or some people prefer ' Igor '  --  that 's what 's printed on the rubber apron they give you. , , " That 's it . " " They tell you to pretend you 're dissecting a frog . " " I see  --  " " Then they bring you a package from UPS . They 're all watching  --  someof them hurry back from coffee , hoping you 'll barf . I can print a floater very well . In fact  --  " " Good , now look at this . His first victim that we know of was found in the Blackwater River in Missouri , outside of Lone Jack , last June . The Bimmel girl , she 'd been reported missing in Belvedere , Ohio , on April 15 , two months before . We could n't tell a lot about it  --  it took another three months just to get her identified . The next one he grabbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Wabash in downtown Lafayette , Indiana , just ten days after she was taken , so we could tell what had happened to her . Next we 've got a white female , early twenties , dumped in the Rolling Fork near I-65 , about thirtyeightmiles south of Louisville , Kentucky . She 's never been identified . And the Varner woman , grabbed in Evansville , Indiana , and dropped in the Embarras just below Interstate 70 in eastern Illinois . " Then he moved south and dumped one in the Conasauga below Damascus , Georgia , down from Interstate 75 , that was this Kittridge girl from Pittsburgh  --  here 's her graduation picture . His luck 's ungodly  --  nobody 's ever seen him make a snatch . Except for the dumps being near an Interstate , we have n't seen any pattern . " " If you trace heaviest-traffic routes backward from the dump sites , do they converge at all ? " " No . " THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 69 " What if you . . . postulate . . . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same trip ? " Starling asked , carefully avoiding the forbidden word assume . " He 'd drop off the body first , would n't he , in case he got in trouble grabbing the next one ? Then , if he was caught grabbing somebody , he might get off for assault , plead it down to zip if he did n't have a body in his car . So how about drawing vectors backward from each abduction site through the previous dump site ? You 've tried it . " " That 's a good idea , but he had it too . If he is doing both things in one trip , he 's zigging around . We 've run computer simulations , first with him westbound on the Interstates , then eastbound , then various combinations with the best dates we can put on the dumps and abductions . You put it in the computerand smoke comes out . He lives in the East , it tells us . He 's not in a moon cycle , it tells us . No convention dates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seen us coming , Star-ling . " " You think he 's too careful to be a suicide . " Crawford nodded . " Definitely too careful . He 's found out how to have a meaningful relationship now , and he wants to do it a lot . I 'm not getting my hopes up for a suicide . " Crawford passed the pilot a cup of water from a thermos . He gave one to Starling and mixed himself an Alka-Seltzer . Her stomach lifted as the airplane started down . " Couple of things , Starling . I look for first-rate forensics from you , but I need more than that . You do n't say much , and that 's okay , neither do I. But do n't ever feel you 've got to have a new fact to tell me before you can bring something up . There are n't any silly questions . You 'll see things that I wo n't , and I want to know what they are . Maybe you 've got a knack for this . All of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listening to him , her stomach lifting and her expression properlyrapt , Starling wondered how long Crawford had known he 'd use her on this case , how hungry for a chance he had wanted her to be . He was a leader , with a leader 's frank-andopenbullshit , all right. 70 THOMAS HARRIS " You think about him enough , you see where he 's been , you get a feel for him , " Crawford went on . " You do n't even dislike him all the time , hard as that is to believe . Then , if you 're lucky , out of all the stuff you know , part of it plucks at you , tries to get your attention . Always tell me when something plucks , Starling . " Listen to me , a crime is confusing enough without the investigationmixing it up . Do n't let a herd of policemen confuse you . Live right behind your eyes . Listen to yourself . Keep the crime separate from what 's going on around you now . Do n't try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and let him show you . " One other thing : an investigation like this is a zoo . It 's spread out over a lot of jurisdictions , and a few are run by losers . We have to get along with them so they wo n't hold out on us . We 're going to Potter , West Virginia . I do n't know about these people we 're going to . They may be fine or they may think we 're the revenuers . " The pilot lifted an earphone away from his head and spoke over his shoulder . " Final approach , Jack . You staying back there ? " " Yeah , " Crawford said . " School 's out , Starling . " CHAPTER 12ow here is the Potter FuneralHome , the largest whiteframe house on Potter Streetin Potter , West Virginia , serving as the morgue for Rankin County . The coroner is a family physician named Dr. Akin . If he rules that a death is questionable , the body is sent on to Claxton Regional Medical Center in the neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starling , riding into Potter from the airstrip in the back of a sheriff 's department cruiser , had to lean up close to the prisoner screen to hear the deputy at the wheel as he explained these things to Jack Crawford . A service was about to get under way at the mortuary . The mourners in their country Sunday best filed up the sidewalk between leggy boxwoods and bunched on the steps , waiting to get in . The freshly painted house and the steps had , each in its own direction , settled slightly out of plumb . In the private parking lot behind the house , where the hearses waited , two young deputies and one old one stood with two state troopers under a bare elm . It was not cold enough for their breath to steam . Starling looked at these men as the cruiser pulled into the lot , 7172 THOMAS HARRISand at once she knew about them . She knew they came from houses that had chifforobes instead of closets and she knew pretty much what was in the chifforobes . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitbags on the walls of their trailers . She knew that the older deputy had grown up with a pump on the porch and had waded to the road in the muddy spring to catch the school bus with his shoes hanging around his neck by the laces , as her father had done . She knew they had carried their lunches to school in paper sacks with grease spots on them from being used over and over and that after lunch they folded the sacks and slipped them in the back pockets of their jeans . She wondered how much Crawford knew about them . There were no handles on the inside of the rear doors in the cruiser , as Starling discovered when the driver and Crawford got out and started toward the back of the funeral home . She had to bat on the glass until one of the deputies beneath the tree saw her , and the driver came back red-faced to let her out . The deputies watched her sidelong as she passed . One said " ma'am . " She gave them a nod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join Crawford on the back porch . When she was far enough away , one of the younger deputies , a newlywed , scratched beneath his jaw and said , " She do n't look half as good as she thinks she does . " " Well , if she just thinks she looks pretty got-damned good , I 'd have to agree with her , myself , " the other young deputy said . " I 'd put her on like a Mark Five gas mask . " " I 'd just as soon have a big watermelon , if it was cold , " the older deputy said , half to himself . Crawford was already talking to the chief deputy , a small , taut man in steel-rimmed glasses and the kind of elastic-sided boots the catalogs call " Romeos . " They had moved into the funeral home 's dim back corridor , where a Coke machine hummed and random odd objects stood against the wall  --  a treadle sewing machine , a tricycle , and a roll of artificial grass , a striped canvas awning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall was a sepia print of Saint Cecilia at the keyboard . Her hair was braided around her head , and roses tumbled onto the keys out of thin air . " I appreciate your letting us know so fast , Sheriff , " Crawford said . The chief deputy was n't having any . " It was somebody from the district attorney 's office called you , " he said . " I know the sheriff did n't call you  --  Sheriff Perkins is on a guided tour of Hawaii at the present time with Mrs. Perkins . I spoke to him on long distance this morning at eight o'clock , that 's three A.M. , Hawaii time . He 'll get back to me later in the day , but he told me Job One is to find out if this is one of our local girls . It could be something that outside elements has just dumped on us . We 'll tend to that before we do anything else . We 've had ' em haul bodies here all the way from Phenix City , Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheriff . If  --  " " I 've been on the phone with the field services commander of the state troopers in Charleston . He 's sending some officers from the Criminal Investigation Section  --  what 's known as the CIS . They 'll give us all the backup we need . " The corridor was filling with deputy sheriffs and troopers ; the chief deputy had too much of an audience . " We 'll get around to you just as soon as we can , and extend you ever courtesy , work with you ever way we can , but right now  --  " " Sheriff , this kind of a sex crime has some aspects that I 'd rather say to you just between us men , you understand what I mean ? " Crawford said , indicating Starling 's presence with a small movement of his head . He hustled the smaller man into a cluttered office off the hall and closed the door . Starling was left to mask her umbrage before the gaggle of deputies . Her teeth hard together , she gazed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eavesdropping through the door . She could hear raised voices , then scraps of a telephone conversation . They were back out in the hall in less than four minutes . The chief deputy 's mouth was tight . " Oscar , go out front and get Dr. Akin . He 's kind of obliged to attend those rites , but I74 THOMAS HARRISdo n't think they 've got started out there yet . Tell him we 've got Claxton on the phone . " The coroner , Dr. Akin , came to the little office and stood with his foot on a chair , tapping his front teeth with a Good Shepherd fan while he had a brief telephone conference with the pathologistin Claxton . Then he agreed to everything . So , in an embalming room with cabbage roses in the wallpaperand a picture molding beneath its high ceiling , in a white frame house of a type she understood , Clarice Starling met with her first direct evidence of Buffalo Bill . The bright green body bag , tightly zipped , was the only modernobject in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected many times in the glass panes of cabinets holding trochars and packages of Rock-Hard Cavity Fluid . Crawford went to the car for the fingerprint transmitter while Starling unpacked her equipment on the drainboard of a large double sink against the wall . Too many people were in. the room . Several deputies , the chief deputy , all had wandered in with them and showed no inclination to leave . It was n't right . Why did n't Crawford come on and get rid of them ? The wallpaper billowed in a draft , billowed inward as the doctor turned on the big , dusty vent fan . Clarice Starling , standing at the sink , needed now a prototype of courage more apt and powerful than any Marine parachute jump . The image came to her , and helped her , but it pierced her too : Her mother , standing at the sink , washing blood out of her father 's hat , running cold water over the hat , saying , " We 'll be all right , Clarice . Tell your brothers and sister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk and then we 'll fix our supper . " Starling took off her scarf and tied it over her hair like a mountain midwife . She took a pair of surgical gloves out of her kit . When she opened her mouth for the first time in Potter , her voice had more than its normal twang and the force of it broughtTHB SILBNCB OP THB LAMBS 75Crawford to the door to listen . " Gentlemen . Gentlemen ! You officers and gentlemen ! Listen here a minute . Please . Now let me take care of her . " She held her hands before their faces as she pulled on the gloves . " There 's things we need to do for her . You brought her this far , and I know her folks would thank you if they could . Now please go on out and let me take care of her . " Crawford saw them suddenly go quiet and respectful and urge each other out in whispers : " Come on , Jess . Let 's go out in the yard . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of the dead : that wherever this victim came from , whoever she was , the river had carried her into the country , and while she lay helpless in this room in the country , Clarice Starling had a special relationship to her . Crawford saw that in this place Starling was heir to the granny women , to the wise women , the herb healers , the stalwart country women who have always done the needful , who keep the watch and when the watch is over , wash and dress the country dead . Then there were only Crawford and Starling and the doctor in the room with the victim , Dr. Akin and Starling looking at each other with a kind of recognition . Both of them were oddly pleased , oddly abashed . Crawford took a jar of Vicks VapoRub out of his pocket and offered it around . Starling watched to see what to do , and when Crawford and the doctor rubbed it around the rims of their nostrils , she did too . She dug her cameras out of the equipment bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind her she heard the zipper of the body bag go down . Starling blinked at the cabbage roses on the wall , took a breath and let it out . She turned around and looked at the body on the table . " They should have put paper bags on her hands , " she said . " I 'll bag them when we 're through . " Carefully , overriding the automatic camera to bracket her exposures , Starling photographedthe body . The victim was a heavy-hipped young woman sixty-seven76 THOMAS HARRISinches long by Starling 's tape . The water had leached her gray where the skin was gone , but it had been cold water and she clearly had n't been in it more than a few days . The body was flayed neatly from a clean line just below the breasts to the knees , about the area that would be covered by a bullfighter 's pants and sash . Her breasts were small and between them , over the sternum , was the apparent cause of death , a ragged , star-shaped wound a hand 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull from just above the eyebrows and ears to the nape . " Dr. Lecter said he 'd start scalping , " Starling said . Crawford stood with his arms folded while she took the pictures . " Get her ears with the Polaroid , " was all he said . He went so far as to purse his lips as he walked around the body . Starling peeled off her glove to trail her finger up the calf of the leg . A section of the trotline and treble fishhooks that had entangled and held the body in the moving river was still wrapped around the lower leg . " What do you see , Starling ? " " Well , she 's not a local  --  her ears are pierced three times each , and she wore glitter polish . Looks like town to me . She 's got maybe two weeks or so hair growth on her legs .

" " Good , Starling . It 's a contact entrance wound over the sternum . The explosion gases expand between the bone and the skin and blow out the star around the hole .

SILENCE OP THE IAMBS 77 " Wrongful death , " Dr. Akins contributed , nodding his head . " I 've got to get in there for at least part of this service .

" " Take samples of grit , take a couple of flakes of polish , " Crawford said . " We 'll tell ' em after we get the results . " Lamar , a lean funeral home assistant with a whiskey bloom in the middle of his face , came in while she was doing it . " You must of been a manicurist one time , " he said . They were glad to see the young woman had no fingernail marks in her palms  --  an indication that , like the others , she had died before anything else was done to her . " You want to print her facedown , Starling ? " Crawford said . " Be easier . " " Let 's do teeth first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just pictures , or a chart ? " Starling attached the dental kit to the front of the fingerprint camera , privately relieved that all the parts were in the bag . " Just pictures , " Crawford said . " A chart can throw you off without X rays . We can eliminate a couple of missing women with the pictures . " Lamar was very gentle with his organist 's hands , opening the young woman 's mouth at Starling 's direction and retracting her lips while Starling placed the one-to-one Polaroid against the face to get details of the front teeth . That part was easy , but she had to shoot the molars with a palatal reflector , watching from the side for the glow through the cheek to be sure the strobe around the lens was lighting the inside of the mouth . She had only seen it done in a forensics class. 78 1'I ( ( ) M AS II A RR ISStarling watched the first Polaroid print of the molars develop , adjusted the lightness control and tried again .

" Give me the flashlight . " " When a body comes out of the water , a lot of times there'slike leaves and things in the mouth , " Lamar said , helping Crawfordto look . Starling took some forceps out of her bag . She looked at Crawford across the body . He nodded . It only took her a second to get it . " What is it , some kind of seed pod ? " Crawford said . " Nawsir , that 's a bug cocoon , " Lamar said . He was right . Starling put it in a jar . " You might want the county agent to look at that , " Lamar said . Facedown , the body was easy to fingerprint . Starling had been prepared for the worst  --  but ' none of the tedious and delicate injection methods or finger stalls were necessary . She took the prints on thin card stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a set of plantar prints as well , in case they had only baby footprints from a hospital for reference .

" He cut the girl from Akron when he slit her clothes off , not much more than a scratch , but it matched the cut up the back of her blouse when they found it beside the road . This is something new , though . I have n't seen this . " " Looks like a burn across the back of her calf , " Starling said . " Old people gets those a lot , " Lamar said . " What ? " Crawford said.

" " The Franklins was running this trotline , it 's their trotline with these unlawful hooks , and they was pulling it up to see if they had any fish . " " Why do you think so ?

" To telephone fish with , " Starling said . " Stun the fish with electric current when you hang the wires in the water and turn the crank . They come to the top and you just dip ' em out . " " Right , " Lamar said , " are you from around here ? " " They do it lots of places , " Starling said . Starling felt the urge to say something before they zipped up the bag , to make a gesture or express some kind of commitment . In the end , she just shook her head and got busy packing the samples into her case . It was different with the body and problem out of sight . In this slack moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starlingstripped off her gloves and turned the water on in the sink .

He came back from the Coke machine with an ice-cold can of soda , unopened , and offered it to her . " No , thanks , " Starling said . " I do n't believe I 'll have one . " " No , hold it under your neck there , " Lamar said , " and on that little bump at the back of your head . Cold 'll make you feel better . It does me . " By the time Starling had finished taping the memo to the pathologist across the zipper of the body bag , Crawford 's fingerprinttransmitter was clicking on the office desk . Finding this victim so soon after the crime was a lucky break . Crawford was determined to identify her quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abduction . His method was a lot of trouble to everyone , but it was fast . Crawford carried a Litton Policefax fingerprint transmitter . Unlike federal-issue facsimile machines , the Policefax is compatiblewith most big-city police department systems . The fingerprintcard Starling had assembled was barely dry . " Load it , Starling , you 've got the nimble fingers . " Do n't smear it was what he meant , and Starling did n't . It was hard , wrapping the glued-together composite card around the little drum while six wire rooms waited around the country . Crawford was on the telephone to the FBI switchboard and wire room in Washington . " Dorothy , is everybody on ? Okay , gentlemen , we 'll turn it down to one-twenty to keep it nice and sharp  --  check one-twenty , everybody ? Atlanta , how about it ? Okay , give me the picture wire . . . now . " Then it was spinning at slow speed for clarity , sending the dead woman 's prints simultaneously to the FBI wire room and major police department wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta , or any of the others got a hit on the fingerprints , a sweep would begin in minutes . Next Crawford sent pictures of the victim 's teeth and photos of her face , the head draped by Starling with a towel in the event the supermarket press got hold of the photographs. 82 THOMAS HARRISThree officers of the West Virginia State Police Criminal InvestigationSection arrived from Charleston as they were leaving . Crawford did a lot of handshaking , passing out cards with the National Crime Information Center hotline number . Starling was interested to see how fast he got them into a male bonding mode . They sure would call up with anything they got , they sure would . You betcha and much oblige . Maybe it was n't male bonding , she decided ; it worked on her too . Lamar waved with his fingers from the porch as Crawford and Starling rode away with the deputy toward the Elk River . The Coke was still pretty cold . Lamar took it into the storeroom and fixed a refreshing beverage for himself . CHAPTER 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Crawford told the driver . " Then I want you to wait forOfficer Starling at the Smithsonian . She 'll go on from there to Quantico . " " Yes sir . " They were crossing the Potomac River against the after-dinnertraffic , coming into downtown Washington from National Airport . The young man at the wheel seemed in awe of Crawford and drove with excessive caution , Starling thought . She did n't blame him ; it was an article of faith at the Academy that the last agent who 'd committed a Full Fuck-Up in Crawford 's command now investigated pilfering at DEW-line installations along the Arctic Circle . Crawford was not in a good humor . Nine hours had passed since he transmitted the fingerprints and pictures of the victim , and she remained unidentified . Along with the West Virginia troopers , he and Starling had worked the bridge and the riverbankuntil dark without result . Starling had heard him on the phone from the airplane , arrangingfor an evening nurse at home. 8384 THOMAS IIARRISThe FBI plain-jane sedan seemed wonderfully quiet after the Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post the hotline and the Latent Descriptor Index when I take your prints up to ID , " Crawford said . " You draft me an insert for the file . An insert , not a 302  --  do you know how to do it ? " " I know how . " " Say I 'm the Index , tell me what 's new . " It took her a second to get it together  --  she was glad Crawford seemed interested in the scaffolding on the Jefferson Memorial as they passed by . The Latent Descriptor Index in the Identification Section 's computer compares the characteristics of a crime under investigationto the known proclivities of criminals on file . When it finds pronounced similarities , it suggests suspects and produces their fingerprints . Then a human operator compares the file fingerprints with latent prints found at the scene . There were no prints yet on Buffalo Bill , but Crawford wanted to be ready . The system requires brief , concise statements . Starling tried to come up with some . " White female , late teens or early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flayed  --  " " Starling , the Index already knows he kills young white women and skins their torsos  --  use ' skinned , ' by the way , ' flayed ' is an uncommon term another officer might not use , and you ca n't be sure the damned thing will read a synonym . It already knows he dumps them in rivers . It does n't know what 's new here . What 's new here , Starling ? " " This is the sixth victim , the first one scalped , the first one with triangular patches taken from the back of the shoulders , the first one shot in the chest , the first one with a cocoon in her throat . " " You forgot broken fingernails . " " No sir , she 's the second one with broken fingernails . " " You 're right . Listen , in your insert for the file , note that the THE SILENCE ON THE LAMBS 85cocoon is confidential . We 'll use it to eliminate false confes-sions . " " I 'm wondering if he 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Starling said . " It would be easy to miss in an autopsy , especially with a floater . You know , the medical examiner sees an obvious cause of death , it 's hot in there , and they want to get through . . . can we check back on that ? " " If we have to . You can count on the pathologists to say they did n't miss anything , naturally . The Cincinnati Jane Doe 's still in the freezer out there . I 'll ask them to look at her , but the other four are in the ground . Exhumation orders stir people up . We had to do it with four patients who passed away under Dr. Lecter 's care , just to make sure what killed them . Let me tell you , it 's a lot of trouble and it upsets the relatives . I 'll do it if I have to , but we 'll see what you find out at the Smithsonian before I decide . " " Scalping . . . that 's rare , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crawford said . " But Dr. Lecter said Buffalo Bill would do it . How did he know that ? " " He did n't know it . " " He said it , though . " " It 's not a big surprise , Starling . I was n't surprised to see that . I should have said that it was rare until the Mengel case , rememberthat ? Scalped the woman ? There were two or three copycats after that . The papers , when they were playing around with the Buffalo Bill tag , they emphasized more than once that this killer does n't take scalps . It 's no surprise after that  --  he probably followshis press . Lecter was guessing . He did n't say when it would happen , so he could never be wrong . If we caught Bill and there was no scalping , Lecter could say we got him just before he did it . " Dr. Lecter also said Buffalo Bill lives in a two-story house . We never got into that . Why do you suppose he said it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very likely right , and he could have told you why , but he wanted to tease you with it . It 's the only86 THOMAS HARRISweakness I ever saw in him  --  he has to look smart , smarter than anybody . He 's been doing it for years . " " You said ask if I do n't know  --  well , I have to ask you to explain that . " " Okay , two of the victims were hanged , right ? High ligature marks , cervical displacement , definite hanging . As Dr. Lecter knows from personal experience , Starling , it 's very hard for one person to hang another against his will . People hang themselves from doorknobs all the time . They hang themselves sitting down , it 's easy . But it 's hard to hang somebody else  --  even when they 're bound up , they manage to get their feet under them , if there 's any support to find with their feet . A ladder 's threatening . Victims wo n't climb it blindfolded and they sure wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it 's done is in a stairwell . Stairs are familiar . Tell them you 're taking them up to use the bathroom , whatever , walk them up with a hood on , slip the noose on , and boot them off the top step with the rope fastened to the landing railing . It 's the only good way in a house . Fellow in California popularized it . If Bill did n't have a stairwell , he 'd kill them another way . Now give me those names , the senior deputy from Potter and the state police guy , the ranking officer . " Starling found them in her notepad , reading by a penlight held in her teeth . " Good , " Crawford said . " When you 're posting a hotline , Starling , always credit the cops by name . They hear their own names , they get more friendly to the hotline . Fame helps them remember to call us if they get something . What does the burn on her leg say to you ? " " Depends if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he 's got a closed truck or a van or a station wagon , ; something long . " " Why ? " ? " Because the burn 's across the back of her calf . " They were at Tenth and Pennsylvania , in front of the new FBITHF . SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 87headquarters that nobody ever refers to as the J. Edgar Hoover Building . " Jeff , you can let me out here , " Crawford said . " Right here , do n't go underneath . Stay in the car , Jeff , just pop the trunk . Come show me , Starling . " She got out with Crawford while he retrieved his datafax and briefcase from the luggage compartment . " He hauled the body in something big enough for the body to be stretched out on its back , " Starling said . " That 's the only way the back of her calf would rest on the floor over the exhaust pipe . In a car trunk like this , she 'd be curled up on her side and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crawford said . She realized then that he 'd gotten her out of the car so he could speak with her privately . " When I told that deputy he and I should n't talk in front of a woman , that burned you , did n't it ? " " Sure . " " It was just smoke . I wanted to get him by himself . " " I know that . " " Okay . " Crawford slammed the trunk and turned away . Starling could n't let it go . " It matters , Mr. Crawford . " He was turning back to her , laden with his fax machine and briefcase , and she had his full attention . " Those cops know who you are , " she said . " They look at you to see how to act . " She stood steady , shrugged her shoulders , opened her palms . There it was , it was true . Crawford performed a measurement on his cold scales . " Duly noted , Starling . Now get on with the bug . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a middle-aged man laden with cases and rumpled from flying , his cuffs muddy from the riverbank , going home to what he did at home . She would have killed for him then . That was one of Crawford'sgreat talents . CHAPTER 14The Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History had been closed for hours , but Crawford had called ahead and a guard waited to let Clarice Starling in the Constitution Avenue entrance . The lights were dimmed in the closed museum and the air was still . Only the colossal figure of a South Seas chieftain facing the entrance stood tall enough for the weak ceiling light to shine on his face . Starling 's guide was a big black man in the neat turnout of the Smithsonian guards . She thought he resembled the chieftain as he raised his face to the elevator lights . There was a moment 's relief in her idle fancy , like rubbing a cramp . The second level above the great stuffed elephant , a vast floor closed to the public , is shared by the departments of Anthropologyand Entomology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entomologists contend it is the third . A few scientists from Agriculture say they have proof that it is the sixth . Each faction has a case in the old building with its additions and subdivisions . Starling followed the guard into a dim maze of corridors walled high with wooden cases of anthropological specimens . Only the small labels revealed their contents. 88 " Thousands of people in these boxes , " the guard said . " Forty thousand specimens . " He found office numbers with his flashlight and trailed the light over the labels as they went along . Dyak baby carriers and ceremonial skulls gave way to Aphids , and they left Man for the older and more orderly world of Insects . Now the corridor was walled with big metal boxes painted pale green . " Thirty million insects  --  and the spiders on top of that . Do n't lump the spiders in with the insects , " the guard advised . " Spider people jump all over you about that . There , the office that 's lit . Do n't try to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bring you down , call me at this extension , it 's the guard office . I 'll come get you . " He gave her a card and left her . She was in the heart of Entomology , on a rotunda gallery high above the great stuffed elephant . There was the office with the lights on and the door open . " Time , Pilch ! " A man 's voice , shrill with excitement . " Let 's go here . Time ! " Starling stopped in the doorway . Two men sat at a laboratory table playing chess . Both were about thirty , one black-haired and lean , the other pudgy with wiry red hair . They appeared to be engrossed in the chessboard . If they noticed Starling , they gave no sign . If they noticed the enormous rhinoceros beetle slowly making its way across the board , weaving among the chessmen , they gave no sign of that either . Then the beetle crossed the edge of the board . " Time , Roden , " the lean one said instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beetle around and started it trudging back the other way . " If the beetle just cuts across the corner , is time up then ? " Starling asked . " Of course time 's up then , " the pudgy one said loudly , without looking up . " Of course it 's up then . How do you play ? Do you make him cross the whole board ? Who do you play against , a sloth ? " I n V M A 1 n A w I 1 " 1 have the specimen Special Agent Crawford called about . " " I ca n't imagine why we did n't hear your siren , " the pudgy one said . " We 're waiting all night here to identify a bug for the FBI . Bugs 're all we do . Nobody said anything about Special Agent Crawford 's specimen . He should show his specimen privately to his family doctor . Time , Pilch ! " " I 'd love to catch your whole routine another time , " Starlingsaid , " but this is urgent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The black-haired one looked around at her , saw her leaningagainst the doorframe with her briefcase . He put the beetle onsome rotten wood in a box and covered it with a lettuce leaf . When he got up , he was tall . " I 'm Noble Pilcher " he said . " That 's Albert Roden . You need an insect identified ? We 're happy to help you . " Pilcher had a long friendly face , but his black eyes were a little witchy and too close together , and one of them had a slight cast that made it catch the light independently . He did not offer to shake hands . " You are . . . ? " " Clarice Starling . " " Let 's see what you 've got : " Pilcher held the small jar to the light . Roden came to look . " Where did you find it ? Did you kill it with your gun ? Did you see its mommy ? " It occurred to Starling how much Roden would benefit from an elbow smash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pilcher said . " Tell us where you found it . Was it attached to anything  --  a twig or a leaf  --  or was it in the soil ? " " I see , " Starling said . " Nobody 's talked to you . " " The Chairman asked us to stay late and identify a bug for the FBI , " Pilcher said . " Told us , " Roden said . " Told us to stay late . " " We do it all the time for Customs and the Department of Agriculture , " Pilcher said . " But not in the middle of the night , " Roden said . " I need to tell you a couple of things involving a criminal case , " Starling said . " I 'm allowed to do that if you 'll keep it inconfidence until the case is resolved . It 's important . It means some lives , and I 'm not just saying that . Dr. Roden , can you tell me seriously that you 'll respect a confidence ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not if your word 's any good . You 'll have to sign for the specimen if you need to keep it , that 's all . " " Of course I 'll help you . I 'm not uncaring . " " Dr. Pilcher ? " " That 's true , " Pilcher said . " He 's not uncaring . " " Confidence ? " " I wo n't tell . " " Pilch is n't a doctor yet either , " Roden said . " We 're on an equal educational footing . But notice how he allowed you to call him that . " Roden placed the tip of his forefinger against his chin , as though pointing to his judicious expression . " Give us all the details . What might seem irrelevant to you could be vital information to an expert . " " This insect was found lodged behind the soft palate of a murder victim . I do n't know how it got there . Her body was in the Elk River in West Virginia , and she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Buffalo Bill , I heard it on the radio , " Roden said . " You did n't hear about the insect on the radio , did you ? " Starling said . " No , but they said Elk River  --  are you coming in from that today , is that why you 're so late ? " " Yes , " Starling said . " You must be tired , do you want some coffee ? " Roden said . " No , thank you . " " Water ? " " No . " " A Coke ? " " I do n't believe so . We want to know where this woman was held captive and where she was killed . We 're hoping this bug has some specialized habitat , or it 's limited in range , you know , or it only sleeps on some kind of tree  --  we want to know wherethis insect is from . I 'm asking for your confidence because  --  if the perpetrator put the insect there deliberately  --  then only he would know that fact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He 's killed six at least . Time 's eating us up . " " Do you think he 's holding another woman right this minute , while we 're looking at his bug ? " Roden asked in her face . His eyes were wide and his mouth open . She could see into his mouth , and she flashed for a second on something else . " I do n't know . " A little shrill , that . " I do n't know , " she said again , to take the edge off it . " He 'll do it again as soon as he can . " So we 'll do this as soon as we can , " Pilcher said . " Do n't worry , we 're good at this . You could n't be in better hands . " He removed the brown object from the jar with a slender forceps and placed it on a sheet of white paper beneath the light . He swung a magnifying glass on a flexible arm over it . The insect was long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a semitransparent cover that followed its general outlines like a sarcophagus . The appendages were bound so tightly against the body , they might have been carved in low relief . The little face looked wise . " In the first place , it 's not anything that would normally infest a body outdoors , and it would n't be in the water except by accident , " Pilcher said . " I do n't know how familiar you are with insects or how much you want to hear . " " Let 's say I do n't know diddly . I want you to tell me the whole thing . " " Okay , this is a pupa , an immature insect , in a chrysalis  --  that 's the cocoon that holds it while it transforms itself from a larva into an adult , " Pilcher said . " Obtect pupa , Pilch ? " Roden wrinkled his nose to hold his glasses up . " Yeah , I think so . You want to pull down Chu on the immatureinsects ? Okay , this is the pupal stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IAMBS 93of the more advanced insects have a pupal stage . A lot of them spend the winter this way . " " Book or look , Pilch ? " Roden said . " I 'll look . " Pilcher moved the specimen to the stage of a microscope and hunched over it with a dental probe in his hand . " Here we go : No distinct respiratory organs on the dorsocephalicregion , spiracles on the mesothorax and some abdominals , let 's start with that . " " Ummhumm , " Roden said , turning pages in a small manual . " Functional mandibles ? " " Nope . " " Paired galeae of maxillae on the ventro meson ? " " Yep , yep . " " Where are the antennae ? " " Adjacent to the mesal margin of the wings . Two pairs of wings , the inside pair are completely covered up . Only the bottomthree abdominal segments are free . Little pointy cremaster  --  I'dsay Lepidoptera . " " That 's what it says here , " Roden said . " It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of territory , " Pilcher said . " It 's gon na be tough if the wings are soaked . I 'll pull the references , " Roden said . " I guess there 's no way I can keep you from talking about me while I 'm gone . " " I guess not , " Pilcher said . " Roden 's all right , " he told Starling as soon as Roden left the room . " I 'm sure he is . " " Are you now . " Pilcher seemed amused . " We were undergraduatestogether , working and glomming any kind of fellowshipwe could . He got one where he had to sit down in a coal mine waiting for proton decay . He just stayed in the dark too long . He 's all right . Just do n't mention proton decay . " " I 'll try to talk around it . " Pilcher turned away from the bright light . " It 's a big family , Lepidoptera . Maybe thirty thousand butterflies and a hundred94 THOMAS HARRISthirty thousand moths . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to if we 're going to narrow it down . " " Okay . Can you do it in one piece ? " " I think so . See , this one had started out on its own power before it died . It had started an irregular fracture in the chrysalis right here . This may take a little while . " Pilcher spread the natural split in the case and eased the insect out . The bunched wings were soaked . Spreading them was like working with a wet , wadded facial tissue . No pattern was visible . Roden was back with the books . " Ready ? " Pilcher said . " Okay , the prothoracic femur is con-cealed . " " What about pilifers ? " " No pilifers , " Pilcher said . " Would you turn out the light , Officer Starling ? " She waited by the wall switch until Pilcher 's penlight came on . He stood back from the table and shined it on the specimen . The insect 's eyes glowed in the dark , reflecting the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably , but which one ? " Pilcher said . " Give us the lights , please . It 's a Noctuid , Officer Starling  --  a night moth . How many Noctuids are there , Roden ? " " Twenty-six hundred and ... about twenty-six hundred have been described . " " Not many this big , though . Okay , let 's see you shine , my man . Roden 's wiry red head covered the microscope . " We have to go to chaetaxy now  --  studying the skin of the insect to narrow it down to one species , " Pilcher said . " Roden 's the best at it . " Starling had the sense that a kindness had passed in the room . Roden responded by starting a fierce argument with Pilcher over whether the specimen 's larval warts were arranged in circlesor not . It raged on through the arrangement of the hairs on the abdomen . THE SILENCE OP THE LAMBS 95 " Erebus odora , " Roden said at last . " Let 's go look , " Pilcher said . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the level just above the great stuffed elephant and back into an enormous quad filled with pale green boxes . What was formerly a great hall had been split into two levels with decks to provide more storage for the Smithsonian 's insects . They were in Neotropicalnow , moving into Noctuids . Pilcher consulted his notepadand stopped at a box chest-high in the great wall stack . " You have to be careful with these things , " he said , sliding the heavy metal door off the box and setting it on the floor . " You drop one on your foot and you hop for weeks . " He ran his finger down the stacked drawers , selected one , and pulled it out . In the tray Starling saw the tiny preserved eggs , the caterpillar in a tube of alcohol , a cocoon peeled away from a specimen very similar to hers , and the adult  --  a big brown-black moth with a wingspan of nearly six inches , a furry body , and slender antennae . " Erebus odora , " Pilcher said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning pages . " ' A tropical species sometimesstraying up to Canada in the fall , ' " he read . " ' The larvae eat acacia , catclaw , and similar plants . Indigenous West Indies , Southern U.S. , considered a pest in Hawaii . ' " Fuckola , Starling thought . " Nuts , " she said aloud . " They 're all over . " " But they 're not all over all the time . " Pilcher 's head was down . He pulled at his chin . " Do they double-brood , Roden ? " " Wait a second . . . yeah , in extreme south Florida and south Texas . " " When ? " " May and August . " " I was just thinking , " Pilcher said . " Your specimen 's a little better developed than the one we have , and it 's fresh . It had started fracturing its cocoon to come out . In the West Indies or Hawaii , maybe , I could understand it , but it 's winter here . In this96 THOMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless it happened accidentally in a greenhouse , or somebody raised it . " " Raised it how ? " " In a cage , in a warm place , with some acacia leaves for the larvae to eat until they 're ready to button up in their cocoons . It 's not hard to do . " " Is it a popular hobby ? Outside professional study , do a lot of people do it ? " " No , primarily it 's entomologists trying to get a perfect specimen , maybe a few collectors . There 's the silk industry too , they raise moths , but not this kind . " " Entomologists must have periodicals , professional journals , people that sell equipment , " Starling said . " Sure , and most of the publications come here . " " Let me make you a bundle , " Roden said . " A couple of people here subscribe privately to the smaller newsletters  --  keep ' em locked up and make you give them a quarter just to look at the stupid things . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see they 're picked up , . thank you , Mr. Roden . " Pilcher photocopied the references on Erebus odora and gave them to her , along with the insect . " I 'll take you down , " he said . They waited for the elevator . " Most people love butterflies and hate moths , " he said . " But moths are more  --  interesting , engaging . " They 're destructive . " " Some are , a lot are , but they live in all kinds of ways . Just like we do . " Silence for one floor . " There 's a moth , more than one in fact , that lives only on tears , " he offered . " That 's all they eat or drink . " " What kind of tears ? Whose tears ? " " The tears of large land mammals , about our size . The old definition of moth was ' anything that gradually , silently eats , consumes , or wastes any other thing . ' It was a verb for destructiontoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt Buffalo Bill ? " " I do it all I can . " Pilcher polished his teeth , his tongue moving behind his lipsTHE SILENCE OF THE . LAMBS 97like a cat beneath the covers . " Do you ever so out for cheeseburgersand beer or the amusing house wine ? " " Not lately . " " Will you go for some with me now ? It 's not far . " " No , but I 'll treat when this is over  --  and Mr. Roden can go too , naturally . " " There 's nothing natural about that , " Pilcher said . And at the door , " I hope you 're through with this soon , Officer Starling . " She hurried to the waiting car . Ardelia Mapp had left Starling 's mail and half a Mounds candy bar on her bed . Mapp was asleep . Starling carried her portable typewriter down to the laundry room , put it on the clothes-folding shelf and cranked in a carbon set . She had organized her notes on Erebus odora in her head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . Then she ate the Mounds and wrote a memo to Crawford suggesting they cross-check the entomology publications ' computerizedmailing lists against the FBI 's known offender files and the files in the cities closest to the abductions , plus felon and sex-offender files of Metro Dade , San Antonio , and Houston , the areas where the moths were most plentiful . There was another thing , too , that she had to bring up for a second time : Let 's ask Dr. Lecter why he thought the perpetrator would start taking scalps . She delivered the paper to the night duty officer and fell into her grateful bed , the voices of the day still whispering , softer than Mapp 's breathing across the room . On the swarming dark she saw the moth 's wise little face . Those glowing eyes had looked at Buffalo Bill . Out of the cosmic hangover the Smithsonian leaves came her last thought and a coda for her day : Over this odd world , this half the world that 's dark now , I have to hunt a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , Catherine Baker Martin andher best boyfriend werewatching a late movie on teldvision in his apartment and having a few hits off a bong pipe loaded with hashish . The commercial breaks grew longer and more frequent . " I 've got the munchies , want some popcorn ? " she said . " I 'll go get it , give me your keys . " " Sit still . I need to see if Mom called , anyway . " She got up from the couch , a tall young woman , big-boned and well fleshed , nearly heavy , with a handsome face and a lot of clean hair . She found her shoes under the coffee table and went outside . The February evening was more raw than cold . A light fog off the Mississippi River hung breast-high over the big parking area . Directly overhead she could see the dying moon , pale and thin as a bone fishhook . Looking up made her a little dizzy . She started across the parking field , navigating steadily toward her own front door a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , among some motor homes and boats on trailers . She noticed itTHE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 99because it resembled the parcel delivery trucks which often brought presents from her mother . As she passed near the truck , a lamp came on in the fog . It was a floor lamp with a shade , standing on the asphalt behind the truck . Beneath the lamp was an overstuffed armchair in redfloweredchintz , the big red flowers blooming in the fog . The two items were like a furniture grouping in a showroom . Catherine Baker Martin blinked several times and kept going . She thought the word surreal and blamed the bong . She was all right . Somebody was moving in or moving out . In . Out . Somebodywas always moving at the Stonehinge Villas . The curtain stirred in her apartment and she saw her cat on the sill , arching and pressing his side against the glass . She had her key ready , and before she used it she looked back . A man climbed out of the back of the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast on his hand and his arm was in a sling . She went inside and locked the door behind her . Catherine Baker Martin peeped around the curtain and saw the man trying to put the chair into the back of the truck . He gripped it with his good hand and tried to boost it with his knee . The chair fell over . He righted it , licked his finger and rubbed at a spot of parking-lot grime on the chintz . She went outside . " Help you with that . " She got the tone just right  --  helpful and that 's all . " Would you ? Thanks . " An odd , strained voice . Not a local accent . The floor lamp lit his face from below , distorting his features , but she could see his body plainly . He had on pressed khaki trousers and some kind of chamois shirt , unbuttoned over a freckled chest . His chin and cheeks were hairless , as smooth as a woman 's , and his eyes only pinpoint gleams above his cheekbonesin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was sensitive to that . Men were often surprised at her size when she got close to them and some concealed it better than others. 100 THOMAS HARRIS " Good , " he said . There was an unpleasant odor about the man , and she noticed with distaste that his chamois shirt still had hairs on it , curly ones across the shoulders and beneath the arms . It was easy lifting the chair onto the low floor of the truck . " Let 's slide it to the front , do you mind ? " He climbed inside and moved some clutter , the big flat pans you can slide under a vehicle to drain the oil , and a small hand winch called a coffin hoist . They pushed the chair forward until it was just behind the seats . " Are you about a fourteen ? " he said . " What ? " " Would you hand me that rope ? It 's just at your feet . " When she bent to look , he brought the plaster cast down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and she raised her hand to it as the cast came down again , smashing her fingers against her skull , and down again , this time behind her ear , a succession of blows , none of them too hard , as she slumped over the chair . She slid to the floor of the truck and lay on her side . The man watched her for a second , then pulled off his cast and the arm sling . Quickly he brought the lamp into the truck and closed the rear doors . He pulled her collar back and , with a flashlight , read the size tag on her blouse . " Good , " he said . He slit the blouse up the back with a pair of bandage scissors , pulled the blouse off , and handcuffed her hands behind her . Spreading a mover 's pad on the floor of the truck , he rolled her onto her back . She was not wearing a brassiere . He prodded her big breasts with his fingers and felt their weight and resilience . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suck mark on her left breast . He licked his finger to rub it as he had done the chintz and nodded when the SILENCE OF THE IAMBS 101lividity went away with light pressure . He rolled her onto her face and checked her scalp , parting her thick hair with his fingers . The padded cast had n't cut her . He checked her pulse with two fingers on the side of her neck and found it strong . " G0000d , " he said . He had a long way to drive to his twostoryhouse and he 'd rather not field-dress her here . Catherine Baker Martin 's cat watched out the window as the truck pulled away , the taillights getting closer and closer together . Behind the cat the telephone was ringing . The machine in the bedroom answered , its red light blinking in the dark . The caller was Catherine 's mother , the junior U.S. Senator from Tennessee . CHAPTER 16I n the 1980s , the Golden Age of Terrorism , procedures were in place to deal with a kidnapping affecting a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Memphis FBI office reported to headquarters in Washington that Senator Ruth Martin 's only daughter had disappeared . At 3:00 A.M. two unmarked vans pulled out of the damp basement garage at the Washington field office , Buzzard 's Point . One van went to the Senate Office Building , where technicians placed monitoring and recording equipment on the telephones in Senator Martin 's office and put a Title 3 wiretap on the pay phones closest to the Senator 's office . The Justice Department woke the most junior member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee to provide the obligatory notice of the tap . The other vehicle , an " eyeball van " with one-way glass and surveillance equipment , was parked on Virginia Avenue to cover the front of the Watergate West , Senator Martin 's Washingtonresidence . Two of the van 's occupants went inside to install monitoring equipment on the Senator 's home telephones . Bell Atlantic estimated the mean trace time at seventy seconds102THB SII.BNCB OF T1111 IAMBS 103on any ransom call placed from a domestic digital switching system . The Reactive Squad at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ransom drop in the Washington area . Their radio procedure changed to mandatory encryption to protect any possible ransom drop from intrusion by news helicopters  --  that kind of irresponsibility on the part of the news business was rare , but it had happened . The Hostage Rescue Team went to an alert status one level short of airborne . Everyone hoped Catherine Baker Martin 's disappearance was a professional kidnapping for ransom ; that possibility offered the best chance for her survival . Nobody mentioned the worst possibility of all . Then , shortly before dawn in Memphis , a city patrolman investigating a prowler complaint on Winchester Avenue stopped an elderly man collecting aluminum cans and junk along the shoulder of the road . In his cart the patrolman found a woman 's blouse , still buttoned in front . The blouse was slit up the back like a funeral suit . The laundry mark was Catherine Baker Martin 's . Jack Crawford was driving south from his home in Arlington at 6:30 A.M. when the telephone in his car beeped for the second time in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand by for Alpha 4 . " Crawford spotted a rest area , pulled in , and stopped to give his full attention to the telephone . Alpha 4 is the Director of the FBI . " Jack  --  you up on Catherine Martin ? " " The night duty officer called me just now . " " Then you know about the blouse . Talk to me . " " Buzzard Point went to kidnap alert , " Crawford said . " I 'd prefer they did n't stand down yet . When they do stand down104 THOMAS HARRISI 'd like to keep the phone surveillance . Slit blouse or not , we do n't know for sure it 's Bill . If it 's a copycat he might call for ransom . Who 's doing taps and traces in Tennessee , us or them ? " " Them . The state police . They 're pretty good .

She got me at home a minute ago . You can imagine . " Yes . " Crawford knew Senator Martin from budget hearings . " She 's coming down with all the weight she 's got . " " I do n't blame her . " " Neither do I , " the Director said . " I 've told her we 're going flat-out , just as we 've done all along . She is . . . she 's aware of your personal situation and she 's offered you a company Lear . Use it  --  come home at night if you can . " " Good . The Senator 's tough , Tommy . If she tries to run it we 'll butt heads . " " I know . Do a set-pick off me if you have to . What have we got at the best  --  six or seven days , Jack ? " " I do n't know . If he panics when he finds out who she is  --  he might just do her and dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two miles from Quantico . " " Will the strip at Quantico take a Lear ? " " Yes . " " Twenty minutes . " " Yes sir . " Crawford punched numbers into his phone and pulled back into traffic . CHAPTER 17Sore from a troubled sleep , Clarice Starling stood in her bathrobe and bunny slippers , towel over her shoulder , waiting to get in the bathroom she and Mapp shared with the students next door . The news from Memphis on the radio froze her for half a breath . " Oh God , " she said . " Oh boy . ALL RIGHT IN THERE ! THIS BATHROOM IS SEIZED . COME OUT WITH YOUR PANTS UP . THIS IS NOT A DRILL ! " She climbed into the shower with a startled next-door neighbor . " Ooch over , Gracie , and would you pass me that soap . " Ear cocked to the telephone , she packed for overnight and set her forensic kit by the door . She made sure the switchboard knew she was in her room and gave up breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class time , with no word , she hurried down to Behavioral Science with her equipment . " Mr. Crawford left for Memphis forty-five minutes ago , " the secretary told her sweetly . " Burroughs went , and Stafford from the lab left from National . " " I put a report here for him last night . Did he leave any message for me ? I 'm Clarice Starling . " " Yes , I know who you are . I have three copies of your tele-106 I UOMAR HARRISphone number right here , and there are several more on his desk , I believe . No , he did n't leave a thing for you , Clarice . " The woman looked at Starling 's luggage . " Would you like me to tell him something when he calls in ? " " Did he leave a Memphis phone number on his three-card ? " " No , he 'll call with it . Do n't you have classes today , Clarice ? You 're still in school , are n't you ? " " Yes . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the classroom was not eased by Gracie Pitman , the young woman she had displaced in the shower . Gracie Pitman sat directly behind Starling . It seemed a long way to her seat . Gracie Pitman 's tongue had time to make two full revolutions in her downy cheek before Starling could submerge into the class . With no breakfast she sat through two hours of " The GoodFaithWarrant Exception to the Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure , " before she could get to the vending machine and chug a Coke . She checked her box for a message at noon and there was nothing . It occurred to her then , as it had on a few other occasionsin her life , that intense frustration tastes very much like the patent medicine called Fleet 's that she 'd had to take as a child . Some days you wake up changed . This was one for Starling , she could tell . What she had seen yesterday at the Potter Funeral Home had caused in her a small tectonic shift . Starling had studied psychology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen some of the hideously offhand ways in which the world breaks things . But she had n't really known , and now she knew : sometimes the family of man produces , behind a human face , a mind whose pleasure is what lay on the porcelain table at Potter , West Virginia , in the room with the cabbage roses . Starling 's first apprehension of that mind was worse than anything she could see on the autopsy scales . The knowledge would lie against her skin forever , and she knew she had to form a callus or it would wear her through . THE . SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 107The school routine did n't help her . All day she had the feeling that things were going on just over the horizon . She seemed to hear a vast murmur of events , like the sound from a distant stadium . Suggestions of movement unsettled her , groups passingin the hallway , cloud shadows moving over , the sound of an airplane . After class Starling ran too many laps and then she swam . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want the water on her anymore . She watched the seven o'clock news with Mapp and a dozen other students in the recreation room . The abduction of Senator Martin 's daughter was not the lead item , but it was first after the Geneva arms talks . There was film from Memphis , starting with the sign of the Stonehinge Villas , shot across the revolving light of a patrol car . The media were blitzing the story and , with little new to report , reporters interviewed each other in the parking lot at Stonehinge . Memphis and Shelby County authorities ducked their heads to unaccustomed banks of microphones . In a jostling , squealing hell of lens flare and audio feedback , they listed the things they did n't know . Still-photographers stooped and darted , backpedaling into the TV minicams whenever investigatorsentered or left Catherine Baker Martin 's apartment . A brief , ironic cheer went up in the Academy recreation room when Crawford 's face appeared briefly in the apartment window . Starling smiled on one side of her mouth . She wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Crawford 's face or if he even knew who Crawford was . Others seemed to think Bill might be watching , too . There was Senator Martin , on television live with Peter Jennings . She stood alone in her child 's bedroom , a Southwestern University pennant and posters favoring Wile E. Coyote and the Equal Rights Amendment on the wall behind her . She was a tall woman with a strong , plain face . " I 'm speaking now to the person who is holding my daugh-108 THOMAS IIARRISter , " she said . She walked closer to the camera , causing an unscheduledrefocus , and spoke as she never would have spoken to a terrorist . " You have the power to let my daughter go unharmed . Her name is Catherine . She 's very gentle and understanding . Please let my daughter go , please release her unharmed . You have control of this situation . You have the power . You are in charge . I know you can feel love and compassion . You can protect her against anything that might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show the whole world that you are capable of great kindness , that you are big enough to treat others better than the world has treated you . Her name is Catherine . " Senator Martin 's eyes cut away from the camera as the picture switched to a home movie of a toddler helping herself walk by hanging on to the mane of a large collie . The Senator 's voice went on : " The film you 're seeing now is Catherine as a little child . Release Catherine . Release her unharmedanywhere in this country and you 'll have my help and my friendship . " Now a series of still photographs  --  Catherine Martin at eight , holding the tiller of a sailboat . The boat was up on blocks and her father was painting the hull . Two recent photographs of the young woman , a full shot and a close-up of her face . Now back to the Senator in close-up : " I promise you in front of this entire country , you 'll have my unstinting aid whenever you need it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Senator . I serve on the Armed Services Committee . I am deeply involved in the Strategic Defense Initiative , the space weapons systems which everyone calls ' Star Wars . ' If you have enemies , I will fight them . If anyone interferes with you , I can stop them . You can call me at any time , day or night . Catherine is my daughter 's name . Please , show us your strength , " Senator Martinsaid in closing , " release Catherine unharmed . " " Boy , is that smart , " Starling said . She was trembling like a terrier . " Jesus , that 's smart . " " What , the Star Wars ? " Mapp said . " If the aliens are tryingTHE SILENCE OF THE IAMBS 109to control Buffalo Bill 's thoughts from another planet , Senator Martin can protect him  --  is that the pitch ? " Starling nodded . " A lot of paranoid schizophrenics have that specific hallucination  --  alien control . If that 's the way Bill 's wired , maybe this approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , though , and she stood up there and fired it , did n't she ? At the least it might buy Catherine a few more days . They may have time to work on Bill a little . Or they may not ; Crawfordthinks his period may be getting shorter . They can try this , they can try other things . " " Nothing I would n't try if he had one of mine . Why did she keep saying ' Catherine , ' why the name all the time ? " " She 's trying to make Buffalo Bill see Catherine as a person . They 're thinking he 'll have to depersonalize her , he 'll have to see her as an object before he can tear her up . Serial murderers talk about that in prison interviews , some of them . They say it 's like working on a doll . " " Do you see Crawford behind Senator Martin 's statement ? " " Maybe , or maybe Dr. Bloom  --  there he is , " Starling said . On the screen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Chicago on the subject of serial murder . Dr. Bloom refused to compare Buffalo Bill with Francis Dolarhydeor Garrett Hobbs , or any of the others in his experience . He refused to use the term " Buffalo Bill . " In fact he did n't say much at all , but he was known to be an expert , probably the expert on the subject , and the network wanted to show his face . They used his final statement for the snapper at the end of the report : " There 's nothing we can threaten him with that 's more terrible than what he faces every day . What we can do is ask him to come to us . We can promise him kind treatment and relief , and we can mean it absolutely and sincerely . " " Could n't we all use some relief , " Mapp said . " Damn if I could n't use some relief myself . Slick obfuscation and facile bullshit , I love it . He did n't tell them anything , but then he probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T H O M A S H A R R I S " I can stop thinking about that kid in West Virginia for a while , " Starling said , " it goes away for , say , a half an hour at a time , and then it pokes me in the throat . Glitter polish on her nails  --  let me not get into it . " Mapp , rummaging among her many enthusiasms , lightened Starling 's gloom at dinner and fascinated eavesdroppers by comparing slant-rhymes in the works of Stevie Wonder and Emily Dickinson . On the way back to the room , Starling snatched a message out of her box and read this : Please call Albert Roden , and a telephone number . " That just proves my theory , " she told Mapp as they flopped on their beds with their books . " What 's that ? " " You meet two guys , right ? The wrong one 'll call you every God damned time . " " I been knowing that . " The telephone rang . Mapp touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's Hot Bobby Lowrance , would you tell him I 'm in the library ? " Mapp said . " I 'll call him tomorrow , tell him . " It was Crawford calling from an airplane , his voice scratchy on the phone . " Starling , pack for two nights and meet me in an hour . " She thought he was gone , there was only a hollow humming on the telephone , then the voice came back abruptly "  --  wo n't need the kit , just clothes . " " Meet you where ? " " The Smithsonian . " He started talking to someone else before he punched off . " Jack Crawford , " Starling said , flipping her bag on the bed . Mapp appeared over the top of her Federal Code of Criminal Procedure . She watched Starling pack , an eyelid drooping over one of her great dark eyes . " I do n't want to put anything on your mind , " she said . " Yes you do , " Starling said . She knew what was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law Review at the University of Marylandwhile working at night . Her academic standing at the academywas number two in the class , her attitude toward the books was pure banzai . " You 're supposed to take the Criminal Code exam tomorrow and the PE test in two days . You make sure Supremo Crawford knows you could get recycled if he 's not careful . Soon as he says , ' Good work , Trainee Starling , ' do n't you say , ' The pleasure was mine . ' You get right in his old Easter Island face and say , ' I 'm counting on you to see to it yourself that I 'm not recycled for missing school . ' Understand what I 'm saying ? " " I can get a makeup on the Code , " Starling said , opening a barrette with her teeth . " Right , and you fail it with no time to study , you think they wo n't recycle you ? Are you kidding me ? Girl , they 'll sail you off the back steps like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clarice . Make him say no recycle . You 've got good grades  --  make him say it . I never would find another roommate that can iron as fast as you can at one minute to class . " Starling had her old Pinto moving up the four-lane at a steady lope , one mile an hour below the speed where the shimmy sets in . The smells of hot oil and mildew , the rattles underneath , the transmission 's whine resonated faintly with memories of her father 's pickup truck , her memories of riding beside him with her squirming brothers and sister . She was doing the driving now , driving at night , the white dashes passing under blip blip blip . She had time to think . Her fears breathed on her from close behind her neck ; other , recent memories squirmed beside her . Starling was very much afraid Catherine Baker Martin 's body had been found . When Buffalo Bill found out who she was , he might have panicked . He might have killed her and dumped her body with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bug to be identified . Why112 THOMAS HARRISelse would he want her at the Smithsonian ? But any agent could carry a bug into the Smithsonian , an FBI messenger could do it for that matter . And he told her to pack for two days . She could understand Crawford not explaining it to her over an unsecured radio link , but it was maddening to wonder . She found an all-news station on the radio and waited through the weather report . When the news came , it was no help . The story from Memphis was a rehash of the seven o'clock news . Senator Martin 's daughter was missing . Her blouse had been found slit up the back in the style of Buffalo Bill . No witnesses . The victim found in West Virginia remained unidentified . West Virginia . Among Clarice Starling 's memories of the PotterFuneral Home was something hard and valuable . Something durable , shining apart from the dark revelations . Something to keep . She deliberately recalled it now and found that she could squeeze it like a talisman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had found strength from a source that surprised and pleased her  --  the memory of her mother . Starling was a seasoned survivor on hand-me-down grace from her late father through her brothers ; she was surprised and moved by this bounty she had found . She parked the Pinto beneath FBI headquarters at Tenth and Pennsylvania . Two television crews were set up on the sidewalk , reporters looking over-groomed in the lights . They were intoning standup reports with the J. Edgar Hoover Building in the background . Starling skirted the lights and walked the two blocks to the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History . She could see a few lighted windows high in the old building . A Baltimore County Police van was parked in the semicircular drive . Crawford 's driver , Jeff , waited at the wheel of a new surveillance van behind it . When he saw Starling coming , he spoke into a hand-held radio . CHAPTER 18The guard took Clarice Starlingto the second level above the Smithsonian 's great stuffed elephant . The elevator door opened onto that vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in the pockets of his raincoat . " Evening , Starling . " " Hello , " she said . Crawford spoke over her shoulder to the guard . " We can make it from here by ourselves , Officer , thank you . " Crawford and Starling walked side by side along a corridor in the stacked trays and cases of anthropological specimens . A few ceiling lights were on , not many . As she fell with him into the hunched , reflective attitude of a campus stroll , Starling became aware that Crawford wanted to put his hand on her shoulder , that he would have done it if it were possible for him to touch her . She waited for him to say something . Finally she stopped , put her hands in her pockets too , and they faced each other across the passage in the silence of the bones . Crawford leaned his head back against the cases and took a113deep breath through his nose . " Catherine Martin 's probably still alive , " he said . Starling nodded , kept her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier to talk if she did n't look at him . He was steady , but something had hold of him . Starling wonderedfor a second if his wife had died . Or maybe spending all day with Catherine 's grieving mother had done it . " Memphis was pretty much of a wipe , " he said . " He got her on the parking lot , I think . Nobody saw it . She went in her apartment and then she came back out for some reason . She did n't mean to stay out long  --  she left the door ajar and flipped the deadbolt so it would n't lock behind her . Her keys were on top of the TV . Nothing disturbed inside . I do n't think she was in the apartment long . She never got as far as her answering machine in the bedroom . The message light was still blinking when her yo-yo boyfriend finally called the police . " Crawford idly let his hand fall into a tray of bones , and quickly took it out again . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed not to do a countdown on the evening news  --  Dr. Bloom thinks it eggs him on . A couple of the tabloids 'll do it anyway . " In one previous abduction , clothing slit up the back had been found soon enough to identify a Buffalo Bill victim while she was still being held alive . Starling remembered the black-borderedcountdown on the front pages of the trash papers . It reached eighteen days before the body floated . " So Catherine Baker Martin 's waiting in Bill 's green room , Starling , and we have maybe a week . That 's at the outside  --  Bloom thinks his period 's getting shorter . " This seemed like a lot of talk for Crawford . The theatrical " green room " reference smacked of bullshit . Starling waited for him to get to the point , and then he did . " But this time , Starling , this time we may have a little break . " She looked up at him beneath her brows , hopeful and watchfultoo . TM PILINGS OP TM LAMB ' aa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilcher and that ... other one . " " Roden . " " They 're working on it . " " Where was it  --  Cincinnati ?  --  the girl in the freezer ? " " No . Come on and I 'll show you . Let 's see what you think about it . " " Entomology 's the other way , Mr. Crawford . " " I know , " he said . They rounded the corner to the door of Anthropology . Light and voices came through the frosted glass . She went in . Three men in laboratory coats worked at a table in the center of the room beneath a brilliant light . Starling could n't see what they were doing . Jerry Burroughs from Behavioral Science was looking over their shoulders taking notes on a clipboard . There was a familiar odor in the room . Then one of the men in white moved to put something in the sink and she could see all right . In a stainless-steel tray on the workbench was " Klaus , " the head she had found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his throat , " Crawford said . " Hold on a minute , Starling . Jerry , are you talking to the wire room ? " Burroughs was reading from his clipboard into the telephone . He put his hand over the mouthpiece . " Yeah , Jack , they 're dryingthe art on Klaus . " Crawford took the receiver from him . " Bobby , do n't wait for the Interpol split . Get a picture wire and transmit the photographsnow , along with the medical . Scandinavian countries , West Germany , the Netherlands . Be sure to say Klaus could be a merchant sailor that jumped ship . Mention that their National Health may have a claim for the cheekbone fracture . Call it the what , the zygomatic arch . Make sure you move both dental charts , the universal and the Federation Dentaire . They 're coming with an age , but emphasize that it 's a rough estimate  --  you ca n't depend on skull sutures for that . " He gave the phone back to Burroughs . " Where 's your gear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guard office downstairs . " " Johns Hopkins found the insect , " Crawford said as they waited for the elevator . " They were doing the head for the Baltimore County police . It was in the throat , just like the girl in West Virginia . " " Just like West Virginia . " " You clucked . Johns Hopkins found it about seven tonight . The Baltimore district attorney called me on the plane . They sent the whole thing over , Klaus and all , so we could see it in situ . They also wanted an opinion from Dr. Angel on Klaus ' age and how old he was when he fractured his cheekbone . They consult the Smithsonian just like we do . " " I have to deal with this a second . You 're saying maybe BuffaloBill killed Klaus ? Years ago ? " " Does it seem farfetched , too much of a coincidence ? " " Right this second it does . " " Let it cook a minute . " " Dr. Lecter told me where to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " Dr. Lecter told me his patient , Benjamin Raspail , claimed to have killed Klaus . But Lecter said he believed it was probably accidental erotic asphyxia . " " That 's what he said . " " You think maybe Dr. Lecter knows exactly how Klaus died , and it was n't Raspail , and it was n't erotic asphyxia ? " " Klaus had a bug in his throat , the girl in West Virginia had a bug in her throat . I never saw that anywhere else . Never read about it , never heard of it . What do you think ? " " I think you told me to pack for two days . You want me to ask Dr. Lecter , do n't you . " " You 're the one he talks to , Starling . " Crawford looked so sad when he said , " I figure you 're game . " She nodded . " We 'll talk on the way to the asylum , " he said . CHAPTER 19r . Lecter had a big psychiatricpractice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He did a slew of psychiatric evaluations for the Maryland and Virginia courts and some others up and down the East Coast . He 's seen a lot of the criminally insane . Who knows what he turned loose , just for fun ? That 's one way he could know . Also , he knew Raspail socially and Raspail told him things in therapy . Maybe Raspail told him who killed Klaus . " Crawford and Starling faced each other in swivel chairs in the back of the surveillance van , whizzing north on U.S. 95 toward Baltimore , thirty-seven miles away . Jeff , in the driver 's compartment , clearly had orders to step on it . " Lecter offered to help , and I had no part of him . I 've had his help before . He gave us nothing useful and he helped Will Graham get a knife jammed through his face last time . For fun . " But a bug in Klaus ' throat , a bug in the girl 's throat in West Virginia , I ca n't ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act before , and neither have I. Have you ever run across it before , Starling ? You 've read the literature since I have . " " Never . Inserting other objects , yes , but never an insect . " " Two things to begin with . First , we go on the premise that117118 THOMAS HARRISDr . Lecter really knows something concrete . Second , we remember that Lecter looks only for the fun . Never forget fun . He has to want Buffalo Bill caught while Catherine Martin 's still alive . All the fun and benefits have to lie in that direction . We 've got nothing to threaten him with  --  he 's lost his commode seat and his books already . That cleans him out . " " What would happen if we just told him the situation and offered him something  --  a cell with a view . That 's what he asked for when he offered to help . " " He offered to help , Starling . He did n't offer to snitch . Snitchingwould n't give him enough of a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . Listen , Lecter 's in no hurry . He 's followed this like it was baseball . We ask him to snitch , he 'll wait . He wo n't do it right away . " " Even for a reward ? Something he wo n't get if Catherine Martin dies ? " " Say we tell him we know he 's got information and we want him to snitch . He 'd have the most fun by waiting and acting like he 's trying to remember week after week , getting Senator Martin'shopes up and letting Catherine die , and then tormenting the next mother and the next , getting their hopes up , always just about to remember  --  that would be better than having a view . It 's the kind of thing he lives on . It 's his nourishment . " I 'm not sure you get wiser as you get older , Starling , but you do learn to dodge a certain amount of hell . We can dodge some right there . " " So Dr. Lecter has to think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Starling said . " Correct . " " Why did you tell me ? Why did n't you just send me in to ask him that way ? " " I level with you . You 'll do the same when you have a command . Nothing else works for long . " " So there 's no mention of the insect in Klaus ' throat , no connection between Klaus and Buffalo Bill . " " No . You came back to him because you were so impressedT N B S I L E N C E O F T N R LAMBS 119that he could predict Buffalo Bill would start scalping . I 'm on the record dismissing him and so is Alan Bloom . But I 'm letting you fool with it . You have an offer for some privileges  --  stuff that only somebody as powerful as Senator Martin could get for him . He has to believe he should hurry because the offer ends if Catherine dies . The Senator totally loses interest in him if that happens . And if he fails , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said he could do  --  it 's not because he 's holding out to spite us . " " Will the Senator lose interest ? " " Better you should be able to say under oath that you never knew the answer to that question . " " I see . " So Senator Martin had n't been told . That took some nerve . Clearly , Crawford was afraid of interference , afraid the Senator might make the mistake of appealing to Dr. Lecter . " Do you see ? " " Yes . How can he be specific enough to steer us to Buffalo Bill without showing he 's got special knowledge ? How can he do that with just theory and insight ? " " I do n't know , Starling . He 's had a long time to think about it . He 's waited through six victims . " The scrambler phone in the van buzzed and blinked with the first of a series of calls Crawford had placed with the FBI switchboard . Over the next twenty minutes he talked to officers he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overstelojtnantin the Swedish Technical Police who had studied at Quantico , a personal acquaintance who was assistant to the Rigspolitichef of the Danish governmental police , and he surprised Starling by breaking into French with the night command desk of the Belgian Police Criminelle . Always he stressed the need for speed in identifying Klaus and his associates . Each jurisdiction would already have the request on its Interpol telex but , with the old-boy network buzzing , the request would n't hang from the machine for hours . Starling could see that Crawford had chosen the van for its120 THOMAS HARRIScommunications  --  it had the new Voice Privacy system  --  but the job would have been easier from his office . Here he had to juggle his notebooks on the tiny desk in marginal light , and they bounced each time the tires hit a tar strip . Starling 's field experience was small , but she knew how unusual it was for a section chief to be booming along in a van on an errand like this . He could have briefed her over the radio telephone . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiet and calm in this van , the time allowed for this mission to proceed in an orderly way , had been purchased at a high price . Listening to Crawford on the phone confirmed it . He was speaking with the Director at home now . " No sir . Did they roll over for it ? . . . How long ? No sir . No . No wire . Tommy , that 's my recommendation , I stand on it . I do not want her to wear a wire . Dr. Bloom says the same thing . He 's fogged in at O'Hare . He 'll come as soon as it clears . Right . " Then Crawford had a cryptic telephone conversation with the night nurse at his house . When he had finished , he looked out the one-way window of the van for perhaps a minute , his glasses held on his knee in the crook of his finger , his face looking naked as the oncoming lights crawled across it . Then he put the glasses on and turned back to Starling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't get any results , Baltimore sweats him until the court pulls them off . " " Sweating him did n't work last time . Dr. Lecter does n't sweat much . " " What did he give them after all that , a paper chicken ? " " A chicken , yes . " The crumpled origami chicken was still in Starling 's purse . She smoothed it out on the little desk and made it peck . " I do n't blame the Baltimore cops . He 's their prisoner . If Catherine floats , they have to be able to tell Senator Martin they tried it all . " " How is Senator Martin ? " THE SILENCE OP THE LAMBS 121 " Game but hurting . She 's a smart , tough woman with a lot of sense , Starling . You 'd probably like her . " " Will Johns Hopkins and Baltimore County homicide keep quiet about the bug in Klaus ' throat ? Can we keep it out of the papers ? " " For three days at least . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust Frederick Chilton , or anybody else at the hospital , " Crawford said . " If Chilton knows , the world knows . Chilton has to know you 're there , but it 's simply a favor you 're doing Baltimore Homicide , trying to close the Klaus case  --  it has nothing to do with Buffalo Bill . " " And I 'm doing this late at night ? " " That 's the only time I 'd give you . I should tell you , the business about the bug in West Virginia will be in the morning papers . The Cincinnati coroner 's office spilled it , so that 's no secret anymore . It 's an inside detail that Lecter can get from you , and it does n't matter , really , as long as he does n't know we found one in Klaus too . " " What have we got to trade him ? " " I 'm working on it , " Crawford said , and turned back to his telephones . CHAPTER 20big bathroom , all white tileand skylights and sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tall plants and loaded with cosmetics , the mirror beaded by the steam the shower made . From the shower came humming in a key too high for the unearthly voice . The song was Fats Waller 's " Cash for Your Trash , " from the musical Ain ' t Misbehavin . Sometimes the voice broke into the words : " Save up all your old newsPA-PERS , Save and pile ' em like a high skySCRAPERDAH DAHDAHDAH DAH DAH DAHDAH DAH DAH ... " Whenever there were words , a small dog scratched at the bathroom door . In the shower was Jame Gumb , white male , thirty-four , six feet one inch , 205 pounds , brown and blue , no distinguishing marks . He pronounces his first name like James without the s . Jame . He insists on it . After his first rinse , Gumb applied Friction des Bains , rubbing122THB SILBNCB OP THB LAMBS 123it over his chest and buttocks with his hands and using a dishmopon the parts he did not like to touch . His legs and feet were a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toweled himself pink and applied a good skin emollient . His full-length mirror had a shower curtain on a bar in front of it . Gumb used the dishmop to tuck his penis and testicles back between his legs . He whipped the shower curtain aside and stood before the mirror , hitting a hipshot pose despite the grindingit caused in his private parts . " Do something for me , honey . Do something for me SOON . " He used the upper range of his naturally deep voice , and he believed he was getting better at it . The hormones he 'd taken  --  Premarin for a while and then diethylstilbestrol , orally  --  could n't do anything for his voice , but they had thinned the hair a little across his slightly budding breasts . A lot of electrolysis had removed Gumb 's beard and shaped his hairline into a widow 's peak , but he did not look like a woman . He looked like a man inclined to fight with his nails as well as his fists and feet . Whether his behavior was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hard to say on short acquaintance , and short acquaintances were the only kind he had . " Whatcha gon na do for meeee ? " The dog scratched on the door at the sound of his voice . Gumb put on his robe and let the dog in . He picked up the little champagne-colored poodle and kissed her plump back . " Ye-e-e-e-s . Are you famished , Precious ? I am too . " He switched the little dog from one arm to the other to open the bedroom door . She squirmed to get down . " Just a mo ' , sweetheart . " With his free hand he picked up a Mini-14 carbine from the floor beside the bed and laid it across the pillows . " Now . Now , then . We 'll have our supper in a minute . " He put the little dog on the floor while he found his nightclothes . She trailed him eagerly downstairs to the kitchen . Jame Gumb took three TV dinners from his microwave oven. 1T THOMAS HARRISThere were two Hungry Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poodle greedily ate her entree and the dessert , leaving the vegetable . Jame Gumb left only the bones on his two trays . He let the little dog out the back door and , clutching his robe closed against the chill , he watched her squat in the narrow strip of light from the doorway . " You have n't done Number Two-000 . All right , I wo n't watch . " But he took a sly peek between his fingers . " Oh , super , you little baggage , are n't you a perfect lady ? Come on , let 's go to bed . " Mr. Gumb liked to go to bed . He did it several times a night . He liked to get up too , and sit in one or another of his many rooms without turning on the light , or work for a little while in the night , when he was hot with something creative . He started to turn out the kitchen light , but paused , his lips in a judicious spout as he considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trays and wiped off the table . A switch at the head of the stairs turned on the lights in the basement . Jame Gumb started down , carrying the trays . The little dog cried in the kitchen and nosed open the door behind him . " All right , Silly Billy . " He scooped up the poodle and carried her down . She wriggled and nosed at the trays in his other hand . " No you do n't , you 've had enough . " He put her down and she followed close beside him through the rambling , multilevel basement . In a basement room directly beneath the kitchen was a well , long dry . Its stone rim , reinforced with modern well rings and cement , rose two feet above the sandy floor . The original wooden safety cover , too heavy for a child to lift , was still in place . There was a trap in the lid big enough to lower a bucket through . The trap was open and Jame Gumb scraped his trays and the dog 's tray into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight into the absolute blackness of the well . The little dog sat up and begged . THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 125 " No , no , all gone , " Gumb said . " You 're too fat as it is . " He climbed the basement stairs , whispering " Fatty Bread , Fatty Bread " to his little dog . He gave no sign if he heard the cry , still fairly strong and sane , that echoed up from the black hole : ' PLEEASE . " CHAPTER 21larice Starling entered theBaltimore State Hospital forthe Criminally Insane at alittle after 10:00 P.M. She was alone . Starling had hoped Dr. Frederick Chilton would n't be there , but he was waiting for her in his office . Chilton wore an English-cut sportcoat in windowpane check . The double vent and skirts gave it a peplum effect , Starling thought . She hoped to God he had n't dressed for her . The room was bare in front of his desk , except for a straight chair screwed to the floor . Starling stood beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell the cold , rank pipes in the rack beside Chilton 's humidor . Dr. Chilton finished examining his collection of Franklin Mint locomotives and turned to her . " Would you like a cup of decaf ? " " No , thanks . I 'm sorry to interrupt your evening . " " You 're still trying to find out something about that head business , " Dr. Chilton said . " Yes . The Baltimore district attorney 's office told me they 'd made the arrangements with you , Doctor . " " Oh yes . I work very closely with the authorities here , Miss126THE SILENCE OP THE IAMBS 127Starling . Are you doing an article or a thesis , by the way ? " " No . " " Have you ever been published in any of the professional journals ? " " No , I never have . This is just an errand the U.S. Attorney 's office asked me to do for Baltimore County Homicide . We left them with an open case and we 're just helping them tidy up the loose ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . " Are you wired , Miss Starling ? " " Am I  --  " " Are you wearing a microphone device to record what Dr. Lecter says ? The police term is ' wired , ' I 'm sure you 've heard it . " " No . " Dr. Chilton took a small Pearlcorder from his desk and popped a cassette into it . " Then put this in your purse . I 'll have it transcribed and forward you a copy . You can use it to augment your notes . " " No , I ca n't do that , Dr. Chilton . " " Why on earth not ? The Baltimore authorities have asked me all along for my analysis of anything Lecter says about this Klaus business . " Get around Chilton if you can , Crawford told her . We can step on him in a minute with a court order , but Lecter will smell it . He can see through Chilton like a CAT scan . " The U.S. Attorney thought we 'd try an informal approach first . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , it would really , it would be the end of any kind of working atmosphere we had . I 'm sure you 'd agree with that . " " How would he find out ? " He 'd read it in the newspaper with everything else you know , you fucking jerk . She did n't answer . " If this should go anywhere and he has to depose , you 'd be the first one to see the material and I 'm sure you 'd be invited to serve as expert witness . We 're just trying to get a lead out of him now . " " Do you know why he talks to you , Miss Starling ? " 125 THOMAS HARRIS " No , Dr. Chilton . " He looked at each item in the claque of certificates and diplomason the walls behind his desk as though he were conductinga poll . Now a slow turn to Starling . " Do you really feel you know what you 're doing ? " " Sure I do . " Lot of ' do " s " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much exercise . She did n't want to fight with Chilton . She had to have something left when she got to Lecter . " What you 're doing is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me . " " I 'm acting on my instructions , Dr. Chilton . I have the U.S. Attorney 's night number here . Now please , either discuss it with him or let me do my job . " " I 'm not a turnkey here , Miss Starling . I do n't come running down here at night just to let people in and out . I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice . " He realized he 'd said a ticket . In that instant Starling saw his life , and he knew it . She saw his bleak refrigerator , the crumbs on the TV tray where he ate alone , the still piles his things stayed in for months until he moved them  --  she felt the ache of his whole yellowsmilingSen-Sen lonesome life  --  and switchblade-quick she knew not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stared into his face , and with the smallest tilt of her head , she gave him her good looks and bored her knowledge in , speared him with it , knowing he could n't stand for the conversation to go on . He sent her with an orderly named Alonzo . CHAPTER ZZescending through the asylumwith Alonzo toward thefinal keep , Starling managed to shut out much of the slammings and the screaming , though she felt them shiver the air against her skin . Pressure built on her as though she sank through water , down and down . The proximity of madmen  --  the thought of Catherine Martin bound and alone , with one of them snuffling her , patting his pockets for his tools  --  braced Starling for her job . But she needed more than resolution . She needed to be calm , to be still , to be the keenest instrument . She had to use patience in the face of the awful need to hurry . If Dr. Lecter knew the answer , she 'd have to find it down among the tendrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker Martin as the child she 'd seen in the film on the news , the little girl in the sailboat . Alonzo pushed the buzzer at the last heavy door . " Teach us to care and not to care , teach us to be still . " " Pardon me ? " Alonzo said , and Starling realized she had spoken aloud . He left her with the big orderly who opened the door . As Alonzo turned away , she saw him cross himself. 129130 THOMAS HARRIS " Welcome back , " the orderly said , and shot the bolts home behind her . " Hello , Barney . " A paperback book was wrapped around Barney 's massive index finger as he held his place . It was Jane Austen 's Sense and Sensibility ; Starling was set to notice everything . " How do you want the lights ? " he said . The corridor between the cells was dim . Near the far end she could see bright light from the last cell shining on the corridor floor . " Dr. Lecter 's awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights are off . " " Let 's leave them like they are . " " Stay in the middle going down , do n't touch the bars , right ? " " I want to shut that TV off . " The television had been moved . It was at the far end , facing up the center of the corridor . Some inmates could see it by leaning their heads against the bars . " Sure , turn the sound off , but leave the picture if you do n't mind . Some of ' em like to look at it . The chair 's right there if you want it . " Starling went down the dim corridor alone . She did not look into the cells on either side . Her footfalls seemed loud to her . The only other sounds were wet snoring from one cell , maybe two , and a low chuckle from another . The late Miggs ' cell had a new occupant . She could see long legs outstretched on the floor , the top of a head resting against the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cell floor in a litter of shredded construction paper . His face was vacant . The television was reflected in his eyes and a shiny thread of spit connected the corner of his mouth and his shoulder . She did n't want to look into Dr. Lecter 's cell until she was sure he had seen her . She passed it , feeling itchy between the shoulders , went to the television and turned off the sound . Dr. Lecter wore the white asylum pajamas in his white cell . The only colors in the cell were his hair and eyes and his red mouth , in a face so long out of the sun it leached into theT H P . S 1 1 . F N C R O P T II P LAMBS 131surrounding whiteness ; his features seemed suspended above the collar of his shirt . He sat at his table behind the nylon net that kept him back from the bars . He was sketching on butcher paper , using his hand for a model . As she watched , he turned his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the inside of the forearm . He used his little finger as a shading stump to modify a charcoal line . She came a little closer to the bars , and he looked up . For Starling every shadow in the cell flew into his eyes and widow 's peak . " Good evening , Dr. Lecter . " The tip of his tongue appeared , with his lips equally red . It touched his upper lip in the exact center and went back in again . " Clarice . " She heard the slight metallic rasp beneath his voice and wondered how long it had been since last he spoke . Beats of silence .. . " You 're up late for a school night , " he said . " This is night school , " she said , wishing her voice were stronger . " Yesterday I was in West Virginia  --  " " Did you hurt yourself ? " " No , I  --  " " You have on a fresh Band-Aid , Clarice . " Then she remembered . " I got a scrape on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Band-Aid was out of sight , on her calf beneath her trousers . He must smell it . " I was in West Virginia yesterday . They found a body over there , Buffalo Bill 's latest . " " Not quite his latest , Clarice . " " His next-to-latest . " " Yes . " " She was scalped . Just as you said she would be . " " Do you mind if I go on sketching while we talk ? " " No , please . " " You viewed the remains ? " " Yes . " " Had you seen his earlier efforts ? " 132 THOMAS HARRIS " No . Only pictures . " " How did you feel ? " " Apprehensive . Then I was busy . " " And after ? " " Shaken . " " Could you function all right ? " Dr. Lecter rubbed his charcoal on the edge of his butcher paper to refine the point . " Very well . I functioned very well . " " For Jack Crawford ? Or does he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Indulge me a moment , Clarice . Would you let your head hang forward , just let it hang forward as though you were asleep . A second more . Thank you , I 've got it now . Have a seat , if you like . You had told Jack Crawford what I said before they found her ? " " Yes . He pretty much pooh-poohed it . " " And after he saw the body in West Virginia ? " He talked to his main authority , from the University of  --  " " Alan Bloom . " " That 's right . Dr. Bloom said Buffalo Bill was fulfilling a persona the newspapers created , the Buffalo Bill scalp-taking business the tabloids were playing with . Dr. Bloom said anybodycould see that was coming . " " Dr. Bloom saw that coming ? " " He said he did . " " He saw it coming , but he kept it to himself . I see . What do you think , Clarice ? " " I 'm not sure . " " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together you fish , do n't you ? Catching anything , Clarice ? " " It 's pretty slow so far . " " What do your two disciplines tell you about Buffalo Bill ? " " By the book , he 's a sadist . " " Life 's too slippery for books , Clarice ; anger appears as lust , lupus presents as hives . " Dr. Lecter finished sketching his left hand with his right , switched the charcoal and began to sketchTHE SILENCE OP THE LAMBS 133his right with his left , and just as well . " Do you mean Dr. Bloom 's book ? " " Yes . " " You looked me up in it , did n't you ? " " Yes . " " How did he describe me ? " " A pure sociopath . " " Would you say Dr. Bloom is always right ? " " I 'm still waiting for the shallowness of affect . " Dr. Lecter 's smile revealed his small white teeth . " We have experts at every hand , Clarice . Dr. Chilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schizoid and irretrievably lost . He put Sammie in Miggs ' old cell , because he thinks Sammie 's said bye-bye . Do you know how hebephrenics usually go ? Do n't worry , he wo n't hear you . " " They 're the hardest to treat , " she said . " Usually they go into terminal withdrawal and personality disintegration . " Dr. Lecter took something from between his sheets of butcher paper and put it in the sliding food carrier . Starling pulled it through . " Only yesterday Sammie sent that across with my supper , " he said . It was a scrap of construction paper with writing in crayon . Starling read : I WAN TOO GO TO JESAI WAN TOO GO WIV CRIEZ I CAN GO WIV JESAEF I AC RELL NIZESAMMIEStarling looked back over her right shoulder . Sammie sat vacant-facedagainst the wall of his cell , his head leaning against the bars . " Would you read it aloud ? He wo n't hear you . " 13 THOMAS HARRISStarling began . " ' I want to go to Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jesus if I act real nice . ' " " No , no . Get a more assertive ' Pease porridge hot ' quality into it . The meter varies but the intensity is the same . " Lecter clapped time softly , " Pease porridge in the pot nine days old . Intensely , you see . Fervently . ' I wan to go to Jesa , I wan to go wiv Criez . ' " " I see , " Starling said , putting the paper back in the carrier . " No , you do n't see anything at all . " Dr. Lecter bounded to his feet , his lithe body suddenly grotesque , bent in a gnomish squat and he was bouncing , clapping time , his voice ringing like sonar , " I wan to go to Jesa  --  " Sammie 's voice boomed behind her sudden as a leopard 's cough , louder than a howler monkey , Sammy up and mashing his face into the bars , livid and straining , the cords standing out in his neck : " I WAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAN GO WIV JESA EF I AC RELL NIIIZE . " Silence . Starling found that she was standing and her folding chair was over backwards . Her papers had spilled from her lap . " Please , " Dr. Lecter said , erect and graceful as a dancer once again , inviting her to sit . He dropped easily into his seat and rested his chin on his hand . " You do n't see at all , " he said again . " Sammie is intensely religious . He 's simply disappointed becauseJesus is so late . May I tell Clarice why you 're here , Sam-mie ? " Sammie grabbed the lower part of his face and halted its movement . " Please ? " Dr. Lecter said . " Eaaah , " Sammie said between his fingers . " Sammie put his mother 's head in the collection plate at the Highway Baptist Church in Trune . They were singing ' Give of Your Best to the Master ' and it was the nicest thing he had . " TM1 SILINCI OP TM1 LAMBS 135Lecter spoke over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perfectlyall right . Watch television .

" I 'm not interested in your worst invention . " " The death of my father , " Starling said . " Tell me . " " He was a town marshal . One night he surprised two burglars , addicts , coming out of the back of the drugstore . As he was getting out of his pickup he short-shucked a pump shotgun and they shot him . " " Short-shucked ?

" It was a moth , " she said . " Please tell me how you anticipated that . " " Clarice , I 'm going to tell you what Buffalo Bill wants CatherineBaker Martin for , and then good night . This is my last word under the current terms . You can tell the Senator what he wants with Catherine and she can come up with a more interesting offer for me . . . or she can wait until Catherine bobs to the surface and see that I was right . " " What does he want her for , Dr. Lecter ? " " He wants a vest with tits on it , " Dr. Lecter said . CHAPTER 23Catherine Baker Martin lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her breathing , loud with her heart . Sometimes the fear stood on her chest the way a trapper kills a fox . Sometimes she could think : she knew she was kidnapped , but she did n't know by whom . She knew she was n't dreaming ; in the absolute dark she could hear the tiny clicks her eyes made when she blinked . She was better now than when she first regained consciousness . Much of the awful vertigo was gone , and she knew there was enough air . She could tell down from up and she had some sense of her body 's position . Her shoulder , hip , and knee hurt from being pressed against the cement floor where she lay . That side was down . Up was the rough futon she had crawled beneath during the last interval of blazing , blinding light . The throbbing in her head had subsided now and her only real pain was in the fingers of her left hand . The ring finger was broken , she knew . She wore a quilted jumpsuit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fabric softener . The floor was clean too , except for the chicken bones and bits of vegetable her captor had raked into the hole . The only other objects with her were139140 THOMAS HARRISthe futon and a plastic sanitation bucket with a thin string tied to the handle . It felt like cotton kitchen string and it led up into the darkness as far as she could reach . Catherine Martin was free to move around , but there was no place to go . The floor she lay on was oval , about eight by ten feet , with a small drain in the center . It was the bottom of a deep covered pit . The smooth cement walls sloped gently inward as they rose . Sounds from above now or was it her heart ? Sounds from above . Sounds came clearly to her from overhead . The oubliette that held her was in the part of the basement directly beneath the kitchen . Footsteps now across the kitchen floor , and running water . The scratching of dog claws on linoleum . Nothing then until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above as the basement lights came on . Then blazing light in the pit , and this time she sat up into the light , the futon across her legs , determined to look around , trying to peer through her fingers as her eyes adjusted , her shadow swaying around her as a floodlamplowered into the pit swung on its cord high above . She flinched as her toilet bucket moved , lifted , swayed upwardon its flimsy string , twisting slowly as it rose toward the light . She tried to swallow down her fear , got too much air with it , but managed to speak . " My family will pay , " she said . " Cash . My mother will pay it now , no questions asked . This is her private  --  oh ! " a flapping shadow down on her , only a towel . " This is her private number . It 's 202  --  " " Wash yourself . " It was the same unearthly voice she 'd heard talking to the dog . Another bucket coming down on a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it off and wash yourself all over , or you 'll get the hose . " And an aside to the dog as the voice faded , " Yes it will get the hose , wo n't it , Darlingheart , yes it will ! " Catherine Martin heard the footsteps and the claws on the floor above the basement . The double vision she 'd had the firstTHB SILBNCB OP THB LAMBS 141time the lights went on was gone now . She could see . How high was the top , was the floodlight on a strong cord ? Could she snag it with the jumpsuit , catch something with the towel . Do somethinghell . The walls were so smooth , a smooth tube upward . A crack in the cement a foot above her reach , the only blemish she could see . She rolled the futon as tightly as she could and tied the roll with the towel . Standing on it , wobbly , reaching for the crack , she got her fingernails in it for balance and peered up into the light . Squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , hanging just a foot down into the pit , almost ten feet above her upstretched hand , it might as well be the moon , and he was coming , the futon was wobbling , she scrabbling at the crack in the wall for balance , hopping down , something , a flake falling past her face . Something coming down past the light , a hose . A single spatterof icy water , a threat . " Wash yourself . All over . " There was a washcloth in the bucket and floating in the water was a plastic bottle of an expensive foreign skin emollient . She did it , goosebumps on her arms and thighs , nipples sore and shriveled in the cool air , she squatted beside the bucket of warm water as close to the wall as she could get and washed . " Now dry off and rub the cream all over . Rub it all over . " The cream was warm from the bath water . Its moisture made the jumpsuit stick to her skin . " Now pick up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , gathering the chicken bones and picking up the English peas . She put them in the bucket , and dabbed the little spots of grease on the cement . Something else here , near the wall . The flake that had fluttered down from the crack above . It was a human fingernail , covered with glitter polish and torn off far back in the quick . The bucket was pulled aloft . " My mother will pay , " Catherine Martin said . " No questions asked . She 'll pay enough for you all to be rich . If it 's a cause , 142 THOMAS HARRISIran or Palestine , or Black Liberation , she 'll give the money for that . All you have to do  --  " The lights went out . Sudden and total darkness . She flinched and went " Uhhhhhh ! " when her sanitation bucket settled beside her on its string . She sat on the futon , her mind racing . She believed now that her captor was alone , that he was a white American . She 'd tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , what color or how many , that her memory of the parking lot was wiped out by the blows on her head . She hoped that he believed he could safely let her go . Her mind was working , working , and at last it worked too well : The fingernail , someone else was here . A woman , a girl was here . Where was she now ? What did he do to her ? Except for shock and disorientation , it would not have been so long in coming to her . As it was , the skin emollient did it . Skin . She knew who had her then . The knowledge fell on her like every scalding awful thing on earth and she was screaming , screaming , under the futon , up and climbing , clawing at the wall , screaming until she was coughing something warm and salty in her mouth , hands to her face , drying sticky on the backs of her hands and she lay rigid on the futon , arching off the floor from head to heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starling 's quarter bonged down through the telephone in the shabby orderlies ' lounge . She dialed the van . " Crawford . " " I 'm at a pay phone outside the maximum security ward , " Starling said . " Dr. Lecter asked me if the insect in West Virginia was a butterfly . He would n't elaborate . He said Buffalo Bill needs Catherine Martin because , I 'm quoting , ' He wants a vest with tits on it . ' Dr. Lecter wants to trade . He wants a ' more interesting ' offer from the Senator . " " Did he break it off ? " " Yes . " " How soon do you think he 'll talk again ? " " I think he 'd like to do this over the next few days , but I 'd rather hit him again now , if I can have some kind of urgent offer from the Senator . " " Urgent is right . We got an ID on the girl in West Virginia , Starling . A missing-person fingerprint card from Detroit rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kimberly Jane Emberg , twenty-two , missing from Detroit since February seventh . We 're canvassing her neighborhood for witnesses . The143144 THOMAS HARRISCharlottesville medical examiner says she died not later than February eleventh , and possibly the day before , the tenth . " " He only kept her alive three days , " Starling said . " His period 's getting shorter . I do n't think anybody 's surprised . " Crawford 's voice was even . " He 's had Catherine Martin about twenty-six hours . I think if Lecter can deliver , he 'd better do it in your next conversation . I 'm set up in the Baltimore field office , the van patched you through . I have a room for you in the HoJo two blocks from the hospital if you need a catnap later on. , , " He 's leery , Mr. Crawford , he 's not sure you 'd let him have anything good . What he said about Buffalo Bill , he traded for personal information about me . I do n't think there 's any textual correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want to know the questions ? " " No . " " That 's why you did n't make me wear a wire , is n't it ? You thought it 'd be easier for me , I 'd be more likely to tell him stuff and please him if nobody else could hear . " " Here 's another possibility for you : What if I trusted your judgment , Starling ? What if I thought you were my best shot , and I wanted to keep a lot of second-guessers off your back ? Would I have you wear a wire then ? " " No sir . " You 're famous for handling agents , are n't you , Mr. Crawfish ? " What can we offer Dr. Lecter ? " " A couple of things I 'm sending over . It 'll be there in five minutes , unless you want to rest a little first . " " I 'd rather do it now , " Starling said . " Tell them to ask for Alonzo . Tell Alonzo I 'll meet him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crawford said . Starling walked up and down the linoleum of the shabby lounge far underground . She was the only brightness in the room . We rarely get to prepare ourselves in meadows or on graveled walks ; we do it on short notice in places without windows , Till SILINCS OP Till LAMBS 145hospital corridors , rooms like this lounge with its cracked plastic sofa and Cinzano ashtrays , where the cafe curtains cover blank concrete . In rooms like this , with so little time , we prepare our gestures , get them by heart so we can do them when we 're frightened in the face of Doom . Starling was old enough to know that ; she did n't let the room affect her . Starling walked up and down . She gestured to the air . " Hold on , girl , " she said aloud . She said it to Catherine Martin and she said it to herself . " We 're better than this room . We 're better than this fucking place , " she said aloud . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Help me . Help me . " She thought for an instant of her late parents . She wondered if they would be ashamed of her now  --  just that question , not its pertinence , no qualifications  --  the way we always ask it . The answer was no , they would not be ashamed of her . She washed her face and went out into the hall . The orderly Alonzo was in the corridor with a sealed package from Crawford . It contained a map and instructions . She read them quickly by the corridor light and pushed the button for Barney to let her in . CHAPTER 25Dr . Lecter was at his table , examininghis correspondence . Starling found it easier to approach the cage when he was n't looking at her . " Doctor . " He held up a finger for silence . When he had finished reading his letter , he sat musing , the thumb of his six-fingered hand beneath his chin , his index finger beside his nose . " What do you make of this ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a letter from the U.S. Patent Office . " This is about my crucifixion watch , " Dr. Lecter said . " They wo n't give me a patent , but they advise me to copyright the face . Look here . " He put a drawing the size of a dinner napkin in the carrier and Starling pulled it through . " You may have noticed that in most crucifixions the hands point to , say , a quarter to three , or ten till two at the earliest , while the feet are at six . On this watch face , Jesus is on the cross , as you see there , and the arms revolve to indicate the time , just like the arms on the popular Disney watches . The feet remain at six and at the top a small second hand revolves in the halo . What do you think ? " 146THE SILBNCB OP THE LAMBS 147The quality of the anatomical sketching was very good . The head was hers . " You 'll lose a lot of detail when it 's reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unfortunately , but think of the clocks . Do you think this is safe without a patent ? " " You 'd be buying quartz watch movements  --  would n't you ?  --  and they 're already under patent . I 'm not sure , but I think patents only apply to unique mechanical devices and copyright applies to design . " " But you 're not a lawyer , are you ? They do n't require that in the FBI anymore . " " I have a proposal for you , " Starling said , opening her briefcase . Barney was coming . She closed the briefcase again . She enviedBarney 's enormous calm . His eyes read negative for dope and there was considerable intelligence behind them . " Excuse me , " Barney said . " If you 've got a lot of papers to wrestle , there 's a one-armed desk , a school desk , in the closet here that the shrinks use . Want it ? " School image . Yes or no ? " May we talk now , Dr. Lecter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barney . Thank you . " Seated now and Barney safely away . " Dr. Lecter , the Senator has a remarkable offer . " " I 'll decide that . You spoke to her so soon ? " " Yes . She 's not holding anything back . This is all she 's got , so it 's not a matter for bargaining . This is it , everything , one offer . " She glanced up from her briefcase . Dr. Lecter , murderer of nine , had his fingers steepled beneath his nose and he was watching her . Behind his eyes was endless night . " If you help us find Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin unharmed , you get the following : transfer to the Veteran'sAdministration hospital at Oneida Park , New York , to a148 THOMAS HARRIScell with a view of the woods around the hospital .

" Every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean with no surveillancecloser than seventy-five yards , but it 'll be SWAT surveillance . That 's it . " " If I decline ? " " Maybe you could hang some cafe curtains in there . It might help . We do n't have anything to threaten you with , Dr. Lecter . What I 've got is a way for you to see the daylight .

Their male figures are simple stereotypes  --  there are some notable exceptions where they draw Mr. America  --  but not much in between . " Look for a house drawing without the rosy-future embellishments  --  nobaby carriage outside , no curtains , no flowers in the yard .

Shall I sum-marize ? " " Yes , I 'd like a summary . " " You should try to obtain a list of people rejected from all three gender-reassignment centers . Check first the ones rejected for criminal record  --  and among those look hard at the burglars . Among those who tried to conceal criminal records , look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence . Possiblyinternment in childhood . Then go to the tests . You 're looking for a white male , probably under thirty-five and sizable . He 's not a transsexual , Clarice . He just thinks he is , and he 's puzzled and angry because they wo n't help him .

" " Then you 'd better run with what you have , Clarice , and we 'll see how you do . " " I need to know how you  --  " " No . Do n't be grabby or we 'll discuss it next week . Come back when you 've made some progress . Or not . And Clarice ? " " Yes . " " Next time you 'll tell me two things . What happened with the horse is one . The other thing I wonder is . . . how do you manage your rage ? " Alonzo came for her . She held her notes against her chest , walking head bent , trying to hold it all in her mind . Eager for the outside air , she did n't even glance toward Chilton 's office as she hurried out of the hospital . Dr. Chilton 's light was on . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty Baltimoredawn , stirrings in the maximum security ward . Down where it is never dark the tormented sense beginning day as oysters in a barrel open to their lost tide . God 's creatures who cried themselves to sleep stirred to cry again and the ravers cleared their throats . Dr. Hannibal Lecter stood stiffly upright at the end of the corridor , his face a foot from the wall . Heavy canvas webbing bound him tightly to a mover 's tall hand truck as though he were a grandfather clock . Beneath the webbing he wore a straitjacketand leg restraints . A hockey mask over his face precluded biting ; it was as effective as a mouthpiece , and not so wet for the orderlies to handle . Behind Dr. Lecter , a small , round-shouldered orderly mopped Lecter 's cage . Barney supervised the thrice-weekly cleaning and searched for contraband at the same time . Moppers tended to hurry , finding it spooky in Dr. Lecter 's quarters . Barney checked behind them . He checked everything and he neglected nothing . Only Barney supervised the handling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with . His two assistantswatched taped hockey highlights on television. 156THE SILENCE OP THE LAMBS 157Dr . Lecter amused himself  --  he has extensive internal resourcesand can entertain himself for years at a time . His thoughts were no more bound by fear or kindness than Milton 's were by physics . He was free in his head . His inner world has intense colors and smells , and not much sound . In fact , he had to strain a bit to hear the voice of the late Benjamin Raspail . Dr. Lecter was musing on how he would give Jame Gumb to Clarice Starling , and it was useful to remember Raspail . Here was the fat flutist on the last day of his life , lying on Lecter 's therapy couch , telling him about Jame Gumb : " fame had the most atrocious room imaginable in this San Francisco flophouse , sort of aubergine walls with smears of psychedelic Day-Glo here and there from the hippie years , terribly battered everything. " fame you know , it 's actually spelled that way on his birth certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pronounce it fame , ' like ' name , ' or he gets livid , even though it was a mistake at the hospital  --  they were hiring cheap help even then that couldn ' t even get a name right . It 's even worse today , it 's worth your life to go in a hospital . Anyway , here was Jame sitting on his bed with his head in his hands in that awful room , and he 'd been fired from the curio store and he 'd done the bad thing again . ' ' I 'd told him I simply could n't put up with his behavior , and Klaus had just come into my life , of course . Jame is not really gay , you know , its just something he picked up in jail . He 's not anything , really , just a sort of total lack that he wants to fill , and so angry . You always felt the room was a little emptier when he came in . I mean he killed his grandparents when he was twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some presence , wouldn " t you ? " And here he was , no job , he 'd done the bad thing again to some luckless bag person . I was gone . He 'd gone by the post office and picked up his former employer 's mail , hoping there was something he could sell . And there was a package from Malaysia , or somewhere over there . He eagerly opened it up and it was a suitcase full of dead butterflies , just in there loose . " His boss sent money to postmasters on all those islands and they sent him boxes and boxes of dead butterflies . He set them in Lucite and made the tackiest158 THOMAS HARRISornaments imaginable  --  and he had the gall to call them objets . The butterflieswere useless to Jame and he dug his hands in them , thinking there might be jewelry underneath  --  sometimes they got bracelets from Bali  --  and he got butterfly powder on his fingers . Nothing . He sat on the bed with his head in his hands , butterfly colors on his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we 've all been , and he was crying . He heard a little noise and it was a butterfly in the open suitcase . It was struggling out of a cocoon that had been thrown in with the butterflies and it climbed out . There was dust in the air from the butterflies and dust in the sun from the window you know how terribly vivid it all is when somebody 's describing it to you stoned . He watched it pump up its wings . It was a big one , he said . Green . And he opened the window and it flew away and he felt so light , he said , and he knew what to do. " lame found the little beach house Klaus and I were using , and when I came home from rehearsal , there he was . But I didn ' t see Klaus . Klaus wasn ' t there . I said where 's Klaus and he said swimming . I knew that was a lie , Klaus never swam , the Pacific 's much too crashy-bangy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I found . Klaus " s head looking out from behind the orange juice . Jame had made himself an apron too , you know , from Klaus , and he put it on and asked me how I liked him now . I know you must be appalled that I 'd ever have anything else to do with Jame  --  he was even more unstable when you met him , I think he was just astounded that you were n't afraid of him . " " And then , the last words Raspail ever said : " I wonder why my parents did n't kill me before I was old enough to fool them . " The slender handle of the stiletto wiggled as Raspail ' s spiked heart tried to keep beating , and Dr. Lecter said , " Looks like a straw down a doodlebug hole , does n't it ? " but it was too late for Raspail to answer . Dr. Lecter could remember every word , and much more too . Pleasant thoughts to pass the time while they cleaned his cell . Clarice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getJame Gumb with what he had told her , but it was a long shot . To get him in time , she would need more specifics . Dr. Lecterfelt sure that when he read the details of the crimes , hints wouldTHE . SILENCE OP THE LAMES 159suggest themselves  --  possibly having to do with Gumb 's job training in the juvenile correction facility after he killed his grandparents . He 'd give her Jame Gumb tomorrow , and make it clear enough so that even Jack Crawford could n't miss it . Tomorrowshould see it done . Behind him , Dr. Lecter heard footsteps and the television was turned off . He felt the hand truck tilt back . Now would begin the long , tedious process of freeing him within the cell . It was always done the same way . First Barney and his helpers laid him gently on his cot , facedown . Then Barney tied his ankles to the bar at the foot of the cot with towels , removed the leg restraints , and , covered by his two helpers armed with Mace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straitjacket and backed out of the cell , locking the net and the barred door in place , and leaving Dr. Lecter to work his way out of his bonds . Then the doctor traded the equipment for his breakfast . The procedure had been in effect ever since Dr. Lecter savaged the nurse , and it worked out nicely for everyone . Today the process was interrupted.
