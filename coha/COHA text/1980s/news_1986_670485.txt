" When I made this film , I assumed it would be for a small audience , " he said of his dramatic portrait of an adolescent saint . " During the screening in Cannes , I left the theater because I didn ' t want to see people walking out. " // " Therese , " now playing at the Lincoln Plaza , was hailed as the revelation of this year ' s festival . Although the international press had been anticipating awards for some of the heavyweights - from " The Mission " to " The Sacrifice " - expectations were not running high for a low-budget , no-star , and hardly-contemporary story of faith . Indeed , the box-office figures for another French entry , " Menage , " had indicated that trendy cynicism and hyperbole were components for success in 1986. // But with modest aims and means , Mr. Cavalier chose to " give the spectator something different , " in his words . " I wanted to get away from the mass of images and sounds that bombard me every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a face or make the most hidden movements of a body perceptible . I was delighted to film women who decide to shut themselves away - and then open themselves all the more. " // Brief tableaux tell the true story of Therese Martin , a 15-year-old girl who decides to follow two of her sisters into the Carmelite order near the end of the 19th century . Although her widowed father ( Jean Pelegri ) does not oppose her , the church authorities consider her too young and fragile ; unstoppable , she begs the Pope for permission. // Once in the convent , Therese accepts the harshness of its rules - the periods of total silence , miserable food , cold and penitences - with boundless faith and joy . But after her father ' s death and the entrance of his fourth daughter into Carmel , Therese dies of tuberculosis in 1897 . Her diary is published , and she is declared a saint in 1925. // Despite the austerity of monastic life and the minimalist style of the film , Mr. Cavalier presents a surprisingly rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humorous concreteness : " A guy who ' s been dead 2 , 000 years , and we ' re not even sure he existed , " says one ( in Henri Behar ' s flavorful subtitles ) . // Part of the film ' s lightness comes from the director ' s decision to blend professionals with non-actors : " I chose very lively girls and women , capable of expressing the strongest feelings in the lightest possible manner . If they didn ' t seem to understand anything about religion , it was no obstacle . Working together , we tried to be swift and spontaneous ; after all , being a Carmelite is a sort of ' job , ' with its own jokes and daily gestures. " // Mr. Cavalier ' s interest in Therese de Lisieux stems from his religious background : " I have a Catholic education , " the 55-year-old film maker explained in French during a recent visit to New York , " and Therese was like a star . She must have helped me one day when I was sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , I read a little book describing the end of her life day by day - what she said , the remedies she took - and it was an extraordinary document from which to make a film . It brought back the emotion of childhood . I like mysteries , shadows and penetrating a secret domain like Carmel. " // He first planned to make the film some 14 years ago with Isabelle Adjani in the lead . But the idea merely ripened in his imagination until he came across Catherine Mouchet , a young stage actress , at the Conservatoire National d ' Art Dramatique . " She was the first one I saw on the first day , and with my Christian background , " he said with a smile as he remembered his disbelief in his good fortune , " I thought I had to keep searching . For two years , I looked for another actress , but it didn ' t work : she was the one. " // Her performance remained with him through a striking image : " She was reciting Bernanoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balloon filled with water between her legs , " recounted Mr. Cavalier . " With a small knife , she was perforating the balloon , and the water dripped onto the stage , reaching the audience as the monologue ended. " // " The Conservatoire is a kind of Carmel of acting - very strict , " he continued . " And Catherine lives her theatrical work with the same rigor that Therese lived her vocation as a Carmelite . She ' s an ' extremist. ' " // During a recent interview in New York , Ms. Mouchet looked quite relaxed for an extremist , her face as fresh and open as that of Therese inside her nun ' s cowl . " I had a Catholic education , so this wasn ' t new to me , " aknowledged the 27-year-old actress . " On the set , there were no intellectual conversations about religion , mysticism or convictions : I don ' t even know what Cavalier thinks about these things , and that ' s fine. " // Speaking in rapid French , Ms. Mouchet observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between theater and film . Given the numerous close-ups in cinematographer Philippe ( " Diva " ) Rousselot ' s expressive design , she learned about the precision of " gestures for framing and lighting , " in her words . " There was one special or privileged moment - the setting of the lights : I was relaxed and would try different positions or movements . Cavalier watched and then kept some of these things in the film. " // She especially appreciated a certain freedom offered by the cinematographer : " Rousselot would say to me , ' If you put your head to the right , you ' ll be in the light ; and to the left , you ' ll be in the dark . It ' s up to you. ' " // Mr. Cavalier ' s work with the cinematographer - whose lighting seems to embrace the characters with an almost divine luminosity - was mainly in two stages : " First , I showed him Manet ' s paintings , which say it all , " the director remarked . " Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we weren ' t after realism. " // In its self-conscious simplicity , " Therese " has been compared to Robert Bresson ' s work , from " Diary of a Country Priest " to " L ' Argent . " When asked about their possible influence , Mr. Cavalier replied , " No French film maker can escape the double influence of the two fathers we ' ve had - Jean Renoir and Bresson . I pity those who have followed only one or the other ; Renoir was our mother - open and generous - and Bresson the severe father. " // " Therese " also brings to mind " La Religieuse , " Jacques Rivette ' s adaptation of Diderot ' s novel . It shares with this film of 1965 ( which was initially banned in France ) a passionate heroine in a convent , as well as a style purified to simplicity . The salient difference is that Suzanne ( Anna Karina ) fought the familial , religious social powers that thrust her into the monastic order , whereas Therese embraces the convent of Carmel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only saint named Therese gracing movie screens at the moment : " Mother Teresa , " currently at the Bleecker Street Cinema , is a documentary about the 76-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who runs 320 missions around the world . Together , these films define the poles of religious faith , from a movement inward ( the self-enclosed community , fueled by ritual , of " Therese " ) to a quest into the world of social activism : " Mother Teresa " is filmed in such volatile places as Beirut , Guatemala , Africa , Calcutta and the South Bronx. // At a time when the primary female images in French cinema range from the narcissistic ( Eric Rohmer ' s " Summer " ) to the tawdry ( " Menage " ) to the psychotic ( " Betty Blue " ) , Mr. Cavalier found in Therese a challenge to both the cliches and the sensorial overload in which they ' re depicted . " I wanted to wash the ear and eye of the spectator a bit , " he admitted . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help me progress as a film maker . I took her as my subject , and also as pure cinematographic inspiration. " //
