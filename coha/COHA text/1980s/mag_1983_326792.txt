Air Canada Flight 143 was cruising smoothly at 39,000 ft. in clear skies above the Manitoba prairie when Pilot Bob Pearson saw a warning light blink on . The message : fuel in one tank had run out . Seconds later , one engine of the brand-new Boeing 767 coughed and died . As Pearson attempted to restart it , five more warning lights began to flash . Then , the twin-engine jet 's other engine stopped . There was nothing but an eerie and chilling silence . <P> As the powerless craft began to lose altitude , First Officer Marcel Quintal , a Royal Canadian Air Force veteran , remembered an abandoned military strip at Gimli , 60 miles to the southwest . In the hushed cabin , the flight attendants told the 61 passengers to prepare for a crash landing . <P> Like all commercial jets , the 767 is designed to glide without power for a distance at least 16 times its altitude . In the case of Air Canada Flight 143 , that meant more than 100 miles . As soon as the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms was activated . A 24-volt nickel-cadmium emergency battery took over the plane 's dead electrical system , providing enough juice to operate the radio and the key instruments in the cockpit . At the same time , a ram-air turbine dropped into position beneath the aircraft 's belly . The airstream passing through the turbine generated enough pressure to activate the part of the hydraulic system that controls the flight spoilers , rudder and ailerons . This allowed Pearson , who happened to be an experienced glider pilot , to control the craft . The turbine also provided sufficient power to allow the pilot to release the landing gear , which then fell into place automatically . <P> Still , a powerless landing poses major difficulties . The flaps , which normally slow a plane down while increasing its lift , can not be operated by the weakened hydraulic system . As a result , a 767 without power lands at about 210 m.p.h. , instead of the usual 150 m.p.h . Nor can a pilot come around for a second try if he does not like his approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one chance . " <P> Pearson might have wanted a second try , for Gimli was anything but abandoned . The 150 members of the Winnipeg Sports Car Club had come out to the strip for a weekend of car racing . As the jet bore down on the strip , they dived for cover . Recalls Art Zuke , 14 , who was pedaling his bicycle on the tarmac : " I saw this thing flying sort of sideways . It was getting lower and lower and closer and closer . " <P> Seconds later , the 767 hit the 6,800-ft. - long runway with such force that the nose wheel collapsed under it . Sparks flew and clouds of black smoke trailed from the tires as Pearson locked the brakes . Said Passenger Bryce Bell : " People were screaming , kids were crying . " The plane finally came to a stop just 300 yds. short of a cluster of trailers filled with families . The only casualties : several passengers who were slightly injured as they slid down the plane 's emergency escape chutes.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
