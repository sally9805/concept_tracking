The movie industry is accustomed to seeing stars begging for parts . What it is not used to is a part begging for a star . That is exactly what happened , however , when Producer Jerry Wheeler ran a pleading ad in Hollywood 's trade publications earlier this year . Did n't anybody , he seemed to be saying , want to appear in his film The Front Runner ? <P> What was the catch ? Did he want someone to play a rapist , a child molester or a drooling maniac ? No . Those would have been easy parts to fill . Wheeler wanted a rugged star to play a college track coach who happens to be gay . And despite all the gains made by homosexuals in the U.S. in recent years , playing the part of a gay is still considered by many to be a fast ride to oblivion . <P> Trying to knock down that so-called wisdom , Wheeler listed 92 actors and actresses  --  everyone from Marlon Brando to Robert Redford , Jane Alexander to Susannah York  --  who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might just as well have saved his money . Not only did his ad fail to produce a star , but Jon Pennell , the young actor who had been signed as the coach 's lover , withdrew , deciding that he did not want the role . <P> A few of the actors Wheeler approached might have turned him down , of course , because they disliked the script or the pay , a relatively meager $1 million . But most made it clear that they were frightened by the role . " There 's a general feeling that homosexuality is a dangerous subject , " says Front Runner Director Marshall W. Mason , who has made his name in the theater ( Burn This , Fifth of July ) . <P> One of the few gay projects that have overcome this feeling is Harvey Fierstein 's Torch Song Trilogy , which is now being shot with Fierstein re- creating his Broadway role . But Torch Song is about a drag queen and therefore outside the range of ordinary experience , as were the vastly popular movie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movie actors who have got the most out of acting gay have been those who have played camp roles . No one confused Robert Preston with his outrageous queen in Victor/Victoria , Tom Courtenay with his prissy , mincing backstage assistant in The Dresser , or William Hurt with his flamboyant spinner of dreams in Kiss of the Spider Woman . All three were thought to be brave , tour de force performances . <P> Part of The Front Runner 's problem , ironically , may be that it depicts an ordinary world and that the gay coach is supposed to look and act like any other coach . In the past , the stars who have been injured by playing gay roles have been those who did not appear to be acting , who were so natural that they seemed to be playing themselves . Laurence Luckinbill 's agent , for instance , warned him not to accept the part of a bisexual schoolteacher in Mart Crowley 's movie of The Boys in the Band ( 1970 ) , which took a pioneering look at the gay world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent may have given good advice . The Boys ' boys were so convincing that many people incorrectly thought they were all gay , an assumption that cost Luckinbill , for one , a cigarette commercial worth $15,000 . Said the casting director : " No fags smoke our fags . " That snide comment did not stop Luckinbill from taking two subsequent gay parts , however .
