No , guys , you got it wrong . When Eddie Murphy comes on jiving street smarts ( with just a touch of street menace ) , he needs to land in unnerving proximity to some respectable folks . The sense of danger he imparts to the bourgeoisie in the opening reels of 48 HRS. , Trading Places or Beverly Hills Cop is what makes the audience sigh with satisfaction when he reveals his essential good spirit later in the picture . <P> In his new film Murphy is discovered  --  promisingly  --  as a tracer of lost children in low-life Los Angeles . But he is immediately hired by an oriental religious cult to find the golden child of the title , their missing messiah who they believe will bring peace to this tired , troubled world . The cult is all serenity and acceptance ; Murphy ca n't get a rise out of them . And it turns out that the evil he is fighting comes from the supernatural agents sent up from Hades to kidnap the child . Hard to trade quips with a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lost Ark and indeed come from the same shop , George Lucas ' Industrial Light &; Magic . <P> Dennis Feldman 's script labors almost as hard to get Murphy to Tibet ( where he must seek the abducted " Prince of Light " ) as it does to place him in conflict with Beelzebub 's legions . But it makes little of the comic possibilities in the star 's new screen situation . And Director Michael Ritchie , who can be a wonderfully cockeyed social commentator ( Smile , The Survivors , Fletch ) , seems almost as lost as Murphy when he is back of the beyond . They are both men who need to plant their feet firmly in contemporary American reality if they are to deliver their punches effectively .
