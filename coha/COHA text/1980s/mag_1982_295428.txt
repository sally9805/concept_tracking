A rebellious Congress confronts a stubborn President on the budget <P> Finally a showdown in the lengthy struggle over the new 1983 federal budget is at hand . With nothing less than the fate of the nation 's economy hanging in the balance , key White House aides as well as congressional leaders agree that time is running out in the search for compromise between a stubbornly intransigent President and a suddenly unified but totally unpredictable Congress . This week is the week of decision . Yet there is no certainty whatever that either side will prove capable of reaching one . <P> " We keep dancing around the fire , " observed South Carolina 's Democratic Senator Fritz Rollings last week . " Now we must put up or shut up . " Tennessee Republican Howard Baker , probably the Senate 's most effective Majority Leader since the days of Lyndon Johnson , agrees : " We 've got to do it this week " ( see following story ) . Informally , the contending parties facing off along Washington 's Pennsylvania Avenue have set a midweek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the budget . <P> It is an unusual situation . For the first time in 50 years , the two houses of Congress are controlled by different parties . <P> <P> Nonetheless , their leaders are in unanimous agreement that President Reagan has sent them a budget for fiscal 1983 ( which begins Oct. 1 , 1982 ) with deficits so high that they simply can not , and will not , approve it . Even Reagan 's most loyal aides know that their boss must accept a compromise budget package that will sharply lower those deficits , but they live in fear that he might not do so . <P> Stepping into that political quicksand , the adroit Senate Majority Leader is attempting a most difficult feat . Baker is deftly challenging the economic beliefs of a President from his own party , while trying to preserve party unity . After leading Senate Republicans into solid support of Reagan 's budget and tax policies last year , he is backing their resistance this year but trying to channel it to achieve a constructive compromise with the President . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Congress in which undisciplined procedures and election-year insecurities work strongly against cooperative action on behalf of the nation 's best interests , rather than those of the individual Senators . If Baker manages to rescue his party , his President and himself from this potential quagmire , he will deserve the continued admiration of his colleagues in one of the nation 's most harassed and most criticized institutions . <P> With the deadline looming , Washington endured a week that vacillated from a heady optimism to perhaps an overly pessimistic gloom . It ended with a general consensus that the chances of the key players reaching agreement this week were , at best , only fifty-fifty . <P>
