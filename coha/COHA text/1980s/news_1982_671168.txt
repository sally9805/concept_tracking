On one side are the elderly , who evoke the natural sympathy of senators and members of the House of Representatives and constitute an extremely active voting block . They and their allies in the labor unions want Congress to find new sources of money for Social Security rather than curtail retirement benefits. // On the other side are legions of small-business leaders who believe that they and their employees are already burdened by high taxes and who want to restrain the growth of benefits to keep the Social Security system solvent. // This struggle was prompted by the need to restore the Social Security system to financial health . The National Commission on Social Security Reform has predicted that the cumulative deficit of the Social Security system may be as high as $200 billion by 1989. // For weeks , lobbyists representing retired people , business interests and labor unions have been preparing their positions and have begun to mobilize for the monthslong struggle to mold the future of the Government ' s largest single program. // Several organizations for the elderly already have deployed what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national commission , whose report to President Reagan and Congress is due next month . Some groups have prepared for the coming months of debate on Capitol Hill by training leaders to carry their messages into district Congressional offices across the country. // " We ' re already hearing a lot from these groups , and we ' re going to be hearing an awful lot more , " said Representative James M. Shannon , Democrat of Massachusetts , a member of the House Ways and Means Committee , which has jurisdiction over Social Security legislation . " This is the overriding issue for so many people that the lobbying is going to involve everyone on the Hill , " he said . " We ' re all going to have to spend a lot of time with seniors in our districts. " // Much of the lobbying effort will be carried out by large groups , such as the American Association of Retired Persons , which has nearly 14 million members , and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States , which has 245 , 000 member organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it also will be conducted by myriad smaller groups and by hundreds of individuals whose lobbying takes the form of face-to-face encounters with members of Congress on street corners or in centers for the elderly . <> <> Warnings Fuel Efforts // It is that intimate contact and the fact that the Social Security issue reaches into the families of members of Congress themselves that sets this lobbying effort apart from other such Washington struggles , which often involve giant corporations , vastly larger budgets and battalions of the capital ' s highest-paid lobbyists. // " People ordinarily think of a lobby twisting arms and supplying money in Congress , " said Henry J. Pratt , a professor of political science at Wayne State University and an associate faculty member of the Institute of Gerontology operated by Wayne State and the University of Michigan . " But that ' s not where the elderly have their most impact , " he added. // The efforts of the elderly have been fueled by a spate of warnings about the possible consequences of adjustments to the Social Security system . The Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reagan Administration " is attempting to mutilate this nation ' s best program of social insurance . " Senior PAC , a political action committee that donates money to candidates sympathetic to the interests of old people , enclosed a fund-raising appeal this autumn in an envelope that had a facsimile of a Social Security card with the word " canceled " spelled across it in red ink and this message printed across the top : " They ' re going to destroy Social Security . " <> <> Elderly Reassured on Checks // Many politicians believe such literature is hyperbolic . Neither President Reagan nor Congress has suggested fundamental changes in the Social Security system. // The President has repeatedly assured the retired that benefit checks are not in jeopardy . " No one is trying to take their benefits away from them or cut them back , " he said in a radio address Dec. 18 . The Reagan Administration ' s options , however , include changing the formula and timing for future cost-of-living increases , raising the retirement age and scaling back the basic benefits formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politics of issues affecting the elderly say that the groups ' literature on Social Security has intensified the strong feelings on the issue . They warn that the effect of organizations representing the elderly should not be underestimated. // " These groups command fairly impressive resources , and there aren ' t many groups in Washington that can claim more shock troops than they have , " Mr. Pratt said . " They may not be in the same category as the American Medical Association or the National Rifle Association , but they can mount a formidable campaign. " // The American Association of Retired Persons has seven salaried lobbyists as well as two legislative consultants under contract and a lobbying budget of about $1 million . In recent months , it has supplemented its lobbying staff by identifying members who are active in affairs of the aged and training them to be effective spokesmen for the association ' s position , which emphasizes broad-based new tax revenues such as excise taxes to patch up the system ' s short-term financing problems. // These trained spokesmen , plus 16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state and local affiliates , are part of the association ' s advance guard of informal lobbyists . " Members of Congress are going to feel more strongly after talking to them than they will after talking to us , " said Laurie Fiori , legislative representative of the association . <> <> ' Getting The Word Out ' // At the same time , the National Council of Senior Citizens has begun to assemble teams of its members in the home districts of the House and Senate leadership as well as members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. // " We ' re getting the word out , " said Eric Shulman , director of legislative liaison and research for the council. // The council , which says it has a membership of 4 million , largely union retirees , favors solutions that stress raising revenues rather than cutting benefits , including advancing the Social Security tax increases now scheduled for 1985 , 1986 and 1990 . The council has a record of producing floods of mail and , at times , protesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being jeopardized. // " On issues dear to the hearts of our people , we can reach our members quickly and get them to act quickly , " Mr. Shulman said . <> <> Jumping and Screaming // Meanwhile , 120 labor , religious and social organizations have come together in the Save Our Security Coalition , which is led by such figures as Wilbur J. Cohen , Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare under President Johnson ; Robert M. Ball , Commissioner of Social Security under Presidents Kennedy , Johnson and Nixon ; William J. Driver , Commissioner under President Carter , and Arthur S. Flemming , Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare under President Eisenhower and former chairman of the United States Civil Rights Commission. // " We jump up and down and scream a lot and do the sort of things that any public interest group would do , " said Eugene C. Zack , staff consultant for the group. // Other groups involved in the Social Secrity issue have focused their efforts beyond Capitiol Hill , however . Leaders of the Gray Panthers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions on the issue in city councils and county legislatures. // Senior PAC endorsed candidates in 41 races in the midterm Congressional elections and contributed to 15 candidates . Some people inside the movement itself have criticized these groups for their failure to coordinate their goals on the Social Security issue . " There isn ' t one organized set of proposals , " said one of those leaders , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. // These groups also have outside critics in addition to their opponents in the actual struggle over Social Security . Robert H. Binstock , director of the Policy Center on Aging and a professor of law and politics at Brandeis University , believes that these groups " act as if all older people were the same , have the same status and have the same just desserts. " // Mr. Binstock said that the groups " are not particularly concerned about the disadvantaged hidden in the homogenous mass they see , " and added : " They ' re so hung up on defending the program that they ' ve lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of who isn ' t being served by these programs. " // Business groups , meanwhile , are planning to mount a lobbying offensive of their own . Sharon F. Canner of the National Association of Manufacturers , which has nearly 12 , 000 member organizations , said the association would wait until the national commission completes its work before developing a lobbying position and coordinating its efforts with those of other business groups. // The association supports extending Social Security to Government employees and to others not currently covered by the system , a position also favored by old people . It also favors modifying the cost-of-living adjustments that many business leaders believe are at the heart of the Social Security financing crisis . <> <> Specific Pressure Points // The Chamber of Commerce of the United States , which began its lobbying effort several months ago , is attempting to apply its influence to specific pressure points in the political system. // " We ' re not going to try to mobilize millions of people , " said Mark Cahoon , the chamber ' s director of retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision-makers aware of the equity and economic issues that are at stake. " // " Our membership keeps in close touch with members of Congress , " said Mr. Cahoon . " These people are very attuned to the political process. " // Congressional hearings on Social Security are scheduled to begin in February , but the onslaught of mail and personal entreaties is likely to begin as soon as the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. // " They ' ll be very active , " said Senator William V. Roth Jr . , Republican of Delaware , a member of the Senate Finance Committee . " We get mail from them constantly . It is their livelihood that ' s at stake . An awful lot of them are finding that they are having tough times , and we ' re all going to hear from them in the next few months. " //
