All action movies tend toward the abstract . Once the moviemakers establish a persuasive motive for one set of characters to spend some time and much energy chasing another set of characters around , the truth ( or falsity ) of these pictures must be looked for in the staging and cutting of the subsequent shoot-outs and chases . In judging those , the brain gratefully surrenders to the viscera . In a sense , these films , so dependent for their success on mastery of movie technique , represent one of cinema 's purest forms . And all action movies may aspire to be judged not on the basis of how well they imitate life , but on how well they imitate the genre 's ideal form  --  a Road Runner cartoon . <P> The formula sounds simple enough . But there is a hidden subtlety in it , which lies in the business of motivation . It is sufficient unto the length of an eight-minute animated short subject that Wile E. Coyote have an inexplicable obsession with capturing a pestiferous bird . If , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half in the company of this immortal pair of mortal enemies , we would require some word beyond the occasional " beep- beep . " <P> Take the case of Marion Cobretti ( Sylvester Stallone ) , already better known to readers of the movie ads as Cobra . A man of few grunts ( and no beeps at all ) , he is a member of the Los Angeles police departmentment " zombie squad , " which means that his specialty is wasting homicidal psychopaths without much ado about Fifth Amendment rights . In the present instance they are coming at him in serried ranks , all members of what seems to be a satanic religious cult , whose chief form of worship is serial killing . Ultimately their evil energy is focused on a model , played by Brigitte Nielsen ( Mrs. Stallone in private life ) , who is the only witness to one of their crimes . Assigned to protect her , Cobra reluctantly ( indeed , spiritlessly ) falls in love with her . But this is presented as a distraction from his main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preparation for the climax in which he wipes out the whole mob of " sickos " in a single confrontation . <P> This is handled well enough by Director George P. Cosmatos ( though not quite as well as he did in Rambo II ) . But so what ? Sly Stallone the screenwriter has let down Sly Stallone the actor . At their variously primitive levels , Dirty Harry worked because its protagonist was so emotionally committed to his antibureaucratic and antilegalistic attitudes . Death Wish worked because a man was avenging the brutal death of his wife , and Rambo II worked because Stallone 's character was so determined to rescue his wartime buddies from a Vietnamese prison camp . In each case , these heroic passions were sufficient to disarm  --  at least for the length of the film  --  the audience 's humanistic objections to the means used to gain the desired ends . In other words , their moral fervor canceled out our moral qualms . <P> Cobra 's dispassion , his amoral languor when he is not squeezing off a few rounds ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy , much less rooting interest . One starts to study action-movie technique for want of anything to think about . And that 's not good enough to keep the viewer going either . The best one can say for Cobra is that it is too dopey to pose any threat to the highest values of the republic . May the rest of the movie summer be similarly absent of malice .
