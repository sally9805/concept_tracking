 | One moment I was on a ledge looking down at Niagara Falls and the next I was in the icy water , struggling against the current that was pulling me closer , closer to the brink . Only a miracle saved me from going over . May 30 , 1983 , was a beautiful day , and my spirits were high . College exams were finally over ! Early that morning I drove with my friends Keith Gandy , Greg Grant , and Mike Jerocki ( whom we all call M.J. ) to spend Memorial Day at Niagara Falls ? an hour 's drive from my hometown of Rochester , N.Y . I was starving when we arrived at the Canadian side of the falls ? like most 20 year olds I have a healthy appetite ? so we stopped at a small restaurant for breakfast . Afterwards we drove along the Niagara Parkway , which winds along the bank of the Niagara River . Parking our car , we strolled over to the walkway overlooking the crest of the famous horseshoe-shaped falls . A fine mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water went over the 2,100-footwide crest and fell to boiling spume below . Seven-hundredthousand gallons fall every second ? with enough force to erode four feet of rock a year . " We seem so insignificant ! " I yelled to Keith , but he could n't hear me over the water 's roar . He motioned that he wanted to go farther upriver , and the rest of us followed . We passed the massive Canadian Niagara Mohawk Power Plant about 100 yards from the falls . Laughing and talking with my friends , I paid little attention to the small bridge that topped the complex 's arching hydroelectric water intakes . But within an hour that bridge would be forever etched in my mind . Soon we arrived at the Engineerium , an old power plant located about 500 yards up from the crest of the falls . Keith , who 'd broken his foot a month earlier and was still on crutches , stopped under the trees along the riverbank . Greg and M.J. joined him while I decided to do some exploring on my own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineerium , I walked over and gazed down at the rapids . The churning water had a hypnotic effect , and perhaps that 's why I did a very foolish thing . I stepped off the platform and walked across a short stretch of grassy bank onto a narrow ledge that hung 20 feet over the water . Skipping stones into what I  | did n't realize was one of the most dangerous areas of the rapids , I began to daydream . I thought of a white-water rafting trip I had taken . I thought too about school ? after one year at Monroe County Community College I was going away to college , to Alfred Tech , where I would get my nursing degree . The sharp cry of a seagull broke my reverie , and I realized the height was making me dizzy . " I 'd better go back now , " I thought to myself . And as I turned to the left to rejoin my friends , I lost my balance and plunged head first into the rapids . Hitting the water , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I felt released as I shot to the surface . I had time for one big gulp of air before I was sucked down once more . When I came up again , I made a frantic effort to reach the shore , clawing at the water . Then I was pulled down again . Up . Down . Up . Down . Each time I was sure I would drown . Then the current finally pulled me out of what I later learned was a whirlpool into water that seemed much calmer . On shore my friends were frantic . M.J. , who 'd seen me fall , had gone white with fear . " Sherry 's in the water ! " he yelled . Greg ran down the bank . " Where is she ? " he screamed . " I ca n't find her ! " Suddenly they saw my head rise to the surface . " Get her ! " yelled M.J. But before they could think of a way to reach me , my head disappeared again into the swirling water . The next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though in calmer water , I was moving quickly toward the crest of the falls . Feeling myself in the calmer water . I thought , " Hold on , Sherry , the worst is over . " In those terrifying minutes I was too dazed to realize I 'd landed only 500 yards from the most dangerous waterfalls in the world . The 40 ? F. water was numbingly cold and I was already in shock , almost powerless to help myself . The water slapped at my face and shoulders and tugged me faster and faster . I 'm a weak swimmer , and in deep water I 've always felt more comfortable on my back . To avoid swallowing water , I now quickly rolled over . That decision would help save my life . On shore my friends were racing along the bank , trying to keep me in sight . Greg threw small logs my way . " Watch it ! " yelled M.J. " If they hit her , they 'll knock her out ! " Meanwhile Keith tried to keep me calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll get you ! " But I did n't hear him over the pounding water . And suddenly I realized the current was pulling me toward the fall " This is it , " I thought , as panic rose in my throat . " This is the end of my life . Desperately I prayed to God , " I 'm young ? please do n't take me now ! " For some reason I remembered the brightly wrapped gifts hidden in my closet ? mugs for Dad and Gramps for Father 's Day ; a bank for my brother Wesley , who was graduating from highschool ; an Anniversary Waltz music box for my parents . How sad those gifts would make them now . I even saw my own funeral . Then I pictured the rocks clinking and rolling at the bottom of the falls . Thrashing my arms wildly , I felt I was losing control . I told myself I had to calm down . " I 've just got to trust in God , " I thought . Arching my neck to keep my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I did n't know how hard this would be . Above me , Greg was stripping down to his shorts . He dove into the  | water and was almost paralyzed by the cold . But even though he 's a strong swimmer he soon realized he was no match for the current and had to struggle to get back to shore . Meanwhile Keith threw down his crutches and hobbled with his cast as fast as he could into the road . The first vehicle he flagged whizzed past him . But the second stopped . Ironworkers John Marsh , Pete Quinlan , and Joe Camisa were driving from their nearby work site to retrieve the hard hats they 'd left at the power plant the previous Friday , when they 'd finished a project there . Normally the men would have taken a more direct route , but during the tourist season there is only one-way traffic around the falls and they had had to detour along the parkway . John saw Keith hopping up and down on one foot and , thinking he had had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " he called . " There 's a girl in the water ! A girl in the water ! " Jumping from his truck , John ran down to the riverbank . " I do n't see anything ! " he yelled to Keith . But then he glimpsed a speck about 300 feet out . Privately , John was sure I was done for . Knowing how strong the current is , he doubted I could stay afloat much longer . Even if I did , I 'd quickly be swept over the falls or drawn in and ground up by the power plant 's water intakes , which lay directly in my path . I was , he feared , minutes from death . Then he remembered the weir , a submerged wall-like structure that runs parallel to shore and diverts water away from the falls and toward the water intakes . John , who 'd grown up near the falls , had often seen logs and small boats carried to the weir by the current . They 'd remain there a few minutes before the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I floated into that calmer area ? It was a slim chance . A rope lay coiled in the back of his truck . " Get it ! " he yelled to M.J. Then John scrambled up a steel fence and ran about 300 feet along the bridge that topped the water intakes . Inching down to the level of the water , he waited for me to wash by . Unaware of the rescue being planned , I prayed . I was almost unconscious but determined not to panic . I 'd hold on as long as I could . When M.J. brought the rope to John , he tied one end of it around his waist then watched as Pete and Joe anchored the other end to the bridge 's steel railing . By now I was only 110 yards from the deadly 175-foot drop , and as close as I 'd ever be to shore . " Now ! " John yelled as he jumped into the icy water . The current pulled him under , and he had to fight to stay afloat . Though the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One more minute and I 'd be gone . On shore the gathering crowd had attracted the attention of James Caddis , a Canadian constable . Fearing for John 's safety as much as mine , he shuddered . " We 'll have two deaths instead of one , " he thought to himself . John had swum the 80-foot length of his rope now and was calling my name . He strained , lunged , almost had me .. . but the rope was a foot too short , and his fingers caught only air . The current was pulling me away from the weir . " Do n't let me miss her , " he begged . He made one more try , stretching every bone and ligament . He grabbed my hair . I did n't even feel the tug , but I remember crying out , " Thank you , God ! " Then I looked at John and said , " Thank you too . " " Do n't thank me yet , " John thought to himself . We had to get to shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wrapped me , in a big bear hug . Above us , Pete , Joe , and the constable pulled furiously on the rope . It seemed forever till we were back at shore , but I heard John yell , " You first ! " and saw that we were clinging to a piece of iron bolted in the bridge . My arms made swimming motions as the men raised me from the water ? I could n't believe I 'd been saved . When I actually felt my feet on the shore , I began to believe it . " I made it ! " I whispered through chattering teeth . Suddenly I felt I had to talk about what had happened . I started to speak , but my mind was numb . Then I was put onto a stretcher and wrapped in blankets . " I do n't need these , " I said irritably , trying to throw off the blankets . " Yes , you do , " the attendant answered as he hustled me inside the ambulance . As we raced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormity of what had happened . " Tell me the truth , " I begged M.J. , who was riding with me while Keith and Greg followed in the car . " Is everybody all right ? " I was afraid someone had gotten hurt , even killed , trying to save me . M.J. assured me that no one had been hurt . John Marsh , in fact , had quickly disappeared ? apparently con tinuing on his way to work ! The hospital staff rushed to meet me . Though I 'd been in the 40 ? F. water for less than 15 minutes , water near the freezing point is far more dangerous to the body than air of the same temperature . My biggest danger now was hypothermia , which occurs when the body 's core temperature falls below 93.5 ? F. Blood vessels constrict , cutting off circulation to the limbs . I was blue with cold , and knowing speed was essential , the nurses tightened the thermal blankets around me and applied hot packs even before they knew what my temperature was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level was only one example of my amazing luck that day . And when I learned that X-rays showed my lungs were almost completely clear of fluid , I knew I 'd be okay . " Can I go home now ? " I asked the doctors , anxious to be on time for my late afternoon shift at Rochester 's Genesee Hospital , where I worked as a nursing assistant . " It 's Memorial Day and we 're short staffed , " I explained . The doctors looked at me in amazement . " You wo n't be working today , " one said softly . Once the doctors were sure I was going to be all right , they let me go home . Mom , who had learned of my accident on the local TV news , was waiting anxiously at the door . " Thank . God you 're all right , " she said with tears in her eyes . " God was watching over you today . " I know she 's right . In the days and weeks that followed , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former patients , and from people all over the world , one thing became clear : So much of my rescue hinged on coincidence or fate . So much showed the hand of God . If John had n't gone back for his crew 's hard hats , if his normal route had n't been changed to one-way , if he had n't known the area so well or had a rope in his truck , I would n't be here today , I 've learned a lot from my accident . I 'll never again be as careless as I was when I walked out on that ledge . But most of all I 've seen and reaffirmed my belief in the basic goodness of people At first I was embarrassed by all the publicity surrounding my accident . But then I began to think that if people heard my story , they might be convinced to help others in need . I hope this is true . I know I 'll never discover the cure for cancer or be the first woman on the moon . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my ordinary , daily life , I 'm going to try to reach out , to help others , as John Marsh reached out and helped me.
