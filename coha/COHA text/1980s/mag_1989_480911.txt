Of all the pleasures he found on the road ? better than outfoxing a railroad hull , sleeping in the dirt , or flirting with waitresses ? Beargrease loved to wave at cars stuck at rail crossings while our mile-long freight train slowly clunked by . Wearing foggy sunglasses and a greasy leather cowboy hat that looked like a roadkill , Beargrease would he sitting there in the hot , drowsing air , sunning himself in the freight car 's great windy ham door ? his stage , you might say ? watching the world roll by ... shaggy-topped corn , silos , hills . Then would come a sound of clanging bells . A railroad crossing ! Ahead , a twinkling pileup of cars and trucks baking in the droughty August sun , behind a flashing gate . From that road-tanned face lathered with grime and a two-week growth , Bear-grease 's large white teeth would flash as he yelled to me , ' ' Town up ahead ! " Then , " Hey !  --  " He really had to yell before I could hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woofing , and screeching of the freight car . Beneath that noise , conversation was all snarls and gaps and bunking gestures , with me yelling back , Hu-UUuli ? Whaaaat ! " I " Beargrease takes a deep breath . " A BIG CROSSING . MUST BE NEAR ... " " WHAT ! " Beargrease yells again . " WAIT ! " Digging out the plugs . " I CANT " But extending a grimy hand and beaming his most killing D'Artagnan smile , Bear-grease is already waving like a returning hero to the faces buoying beneath those windshields . Waving as if to say , Yeah , you see me , Sweetheart ! You , too , Sad Sack ! I 'm up here riding the high iron ? up here LIVING for you good peeeeeple and , I 'm , UH ? his head snaps around ? OUTA HERE . Goo-bye ? goo-byegoo-bye to all you sorry suckers stuck here in Rusty Springs , Dingaling , and Outahui Falls At this his hand drops to his side , almost haplessly , like a scrapping dog realizing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , Beargrease sprawls down on the hot steel floor , in the blocky sunshine . So long , towns . Good-bye , envious eyes . Waking up later , I see he has taken off his torn black T-shirt , his chest starkly white against his meaty red arms as he holds the shirt out to dry in the hot wind of what might he Iowa or maybe Minnesota , for all we know . And the train , it only stretches . It stretches until you ca n't see or even hear the engine , stretches until your eyes feel all hot and whirly , like a combine trying to take it all in , the heat and buttery light , the almost tidal distances . The sky deepens . An early star blinks , and in the late red light , corn flickers ? red-dark corn REPORT 49 and early stars , and Beargrease just a booted shadow by the blowing door . Away it all flows , so that when I pull out my earplugs , all I can hear is the whirring grindstone sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornrows sputtering , **25;4144;TOOLONG ... Now , Beargrease 's partner and the leader of this expedition , sixty-year-old Seattle Slim ? old Slim does n't go in for this waving , " showboating " business . But then Slim 's a loner anyway , a wary , taciturn man who , unlike his flamboyant sidekick , easily could pass for a farmer . Slim 's the clean one : There 's another fundamental distinction between them . While Beargrease practically wallows in dirt , like a sparrow , Slim almost never changes his clothes yet somehow never smells or gets noticeably dirty . Through days of heat and grime , the self-sufficient Slim somehow remains clean as a cat in his jeans and checked short-sleeve shirt . Sitting hack in the slamming shadows , his scuffed cowboy boots crossed and an unfiltered Camel cupped in his hand , gray-haired Slim would half the time be just staring down the other wall . Or I 'd look back and see him drowsing in the prairie wind , his face twitching that old wine twitch from his drinking days , an era that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking apples and lemons for his next bottle , Slim saw it was a choice between drinking or dying . The new Slim is addicted only to coffee and cigarettes , while piquant wine he speaks of picturesquely , like the jugs of an old lover , Naw , outa sight , outa mind , that 's Slim 's motto . NoSee-Urn Slim , the Gray Ghost . Tall , raffish Slim , stealing through the rail yards , his pinched face twitching as he motions us ahead like the ghostly remnants of his old platoon . At first , it 's a bit shocking to see an older man act truly sneaky , but Slim , he 's got themoves . I see him stealthily falling in step behind the wheels of a car , stalking like an Indian behind the legs of his horse . Or dropping to one knee in the weeds while the bull ? the railroad cop ? drives by , headlights bouncing and gravel sputtering , during one of those unquiet nights we spent in the yards of Mason City , Iowa ; Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its gaming , snatch-the-bacon quality , rail-riding 's no mere game to Slim , What 's more , he let me know in his quiet way there 'd be no complaining or wimping out as we traveled some 1,700 miles from Iowa , north to Minneapolis , and from there west , across Minnesota and North Dakota into the Rockies of Montana , then across the Idaho panhandle to Spokane. kA II through our youth and beyond , we may failed or if , more likely , my writing failed ? there would always be the road . The road . When I was feeling had or desperate , this word functioned as a kind of rip cord ? it was an image I could pull in my panic to slow my descent when all other remedies had failed . Before I did anything desperate , I would instead imagine myself hitting the road . Crashing through the guardrails , I would hurdle into freedom , plunging deep into the river of another self , while the old one sloughed off and slowly floated to the surface like a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did go that far , I never did really plunge or drift . Oh , I did travel . With my backpack , beard , and ponytail , I hitched across the coun-try several times . I told myself I did n't need any cushy writer 's program or graduate school . In my arrogance and confusion , I did n't want any-one to tell me anything . Wandering would teach me and inspire me to write ? I 'd enlist in the Hard Knocks School , following migration paths tramped down over the years by Kerouac and Burroughs , Hemingway and Jack London . I wince ? half-smile ? as I write this . 1 was young , remember , still green and relatively stu-pid as both a man and a writer . I truly do n't know how anyone , man or woman , learns how to honestly write or think , let alone how anyone becomes a decent adult human being . In my state of mind then , I could have gone round the world and never found what I wanted . Never in all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer . Never did I break the grip of a consciousness fundamentally outside and fixed , orbiting the world like a moon . I guess it was this apparent inability to just drift or be that always made me wonder about hoboes . How does a man exist down there , submerged for years at a stretch , essentially rootless , nameless , motherless ? virtually pastless , in effect ? It seemed a kind of suicide . Still , it 's one thing to want to ride with hoboes at twenty-one , while one 's character is still supple and life is relatively cheap . But now it was different . 1 was thirty-seven , a man with responsibilities , too old even for the army . Then there was my wife . I told myself that I had to be careful for my wife , that I was living for two now . But , see , this was fear talking : I was really afraid for me . " Hey ! " Beargrease was glaring at me . " Just do it ! " We were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , we were all tired , and I was balking . In the darkness , miles of cars were rolling back and forth , westbounds and easthounds and trains breaking up . Violently , cars were slamming together , setting up chain reactions that volleyed down the line like rolling thunder . From the weeds where we lay under the white-hot stadium lights , the crunching cars looked like the teeth of a black thresher . And now Slim was getting testy . " Listen , " he said , his voice moving up a notch . " Stop thinking ? just follow us . Do n't think and you 'll do fine ! " Fine ? It was insane . They were proposing to climb , gear and all , across moving trains to get to the train we wanted . " Hey , look , " I said , not about to be shoved around . This may be a piece of cake for you , but " ? I felt myself reaching ? " Ftie never done this . I mean , ca n't we catch an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed . They both did . Then , leaning over and staring into my eyes , Beargrease said slowly , " Hey , man ... you know the difference between high-school ball and pro ball ? " Meaning , Get on the train , asshole . Do n't whine , just jump . I could see the stumps of my legs lying across the track . Football , bullball , murderhallwhatever " sport " this was , I left my brain behind , suddenly less afraid than furious at what seemed only a bullying initiation rite . Under the popping lights , over gleaming swirls of switching rails , I ran after Beargrease , my pack swaying and bedroll swinging . As I approached Hard-nosed and realistic as I thought I was then about the hobo life , I came burdened with certain unavoidable expectations . Middle-class expectations that the hobo invariably holds in deep contempt . Why should anyone do things the hurd way ? This was what I meant , in effect , when I asked about the easy train . And what is the easy train but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as people of middle- or upper-class means , believe we 're entitled to in what amounts to an unwritten contemporary Bill of Rights ! Sure , Beargrease and Slim were basically good , resourceful , trustworthy men . They knew why I had come , and I knew they were looking out for me ? or were so far as such concern stretches in their world . Oh , it 's not that a man ca n't have a few buddies or a partner . It 's the survival , look-out-for-number-one notion that , when push comes to shove , you 're not responsible for , beholden to , or hooked on anybody or anything . Not booze , drugs , or women . Not a life of begging or handouts when you fear and despise helplessness . Not money or comfort of any kind . As a hobo , you 're a voluntary vagabond , not homeless or anybody 's victim but your own . Your allegiance is not to God , mother , or country , and you certainly are no longer suckered by love . Especially love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your freedom ? is to yourself Freedom is your life ; it is to your survival what a rifle is to a soldier . Your freedom is yourself and nothing but yourself . REPORT 51 From their viewpoint , then , Beargrease and Slim had good cause to be irked with me . Whereas I felt they were being reckless and stupid , they felt I was being a wuss and a complainer . But then , they had a point . What could have been more middle-class than my hunger for danger and experience without a corresponding willingness to accept the full consequences ? Much as I wanted the Real Thing , I still sought control . In a world where there is deliberately no control , i was trying to draw discreet limits , as if this were a ski resort where I could take the beginner 's course and then proceed at my own speed . But they were n't buying this . Control was more than uptight , it was unfree . Shut up and eat it , that was my freedom . Out here , freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start , but then never stopping . Once that train got roiling , all you could do was hold on , snared like a flea in the coat of a dirty dog . irst day out , Beargrease and I have to hook up with Slim in the yards of Mason City , Iowa . But when we reach the depot where Slim 's supposed to be jungled up , there 's no sign of him . " Damn ! " Beargrease stands there rubbing his whiskers with his blunt hand . " Well , come on . He 's bound to be at our other spot down the yard . " But he 's not there either . Finally , on the edge of a field between the yard and a street of faded houses , Beargrease drops his pack and bedroll . Though it 's only 11 A.M. , it 's well over 100 degrees and due to hit 106 or 107 by afternoon . It 's sure no time to be traipsing around with packs and water jugs , hunting for Slim . " Look , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait here with the stuff while I go look for Slim ? You got plenty of water . You mind ? " " Hell , no , " I say . Boy , am I ever gung ho . " Really , you go on . " But no sooner do 1 say this than I can feel a weaselly creature clawing at my insides . Trying to sound as offhand as possible , I call after him , " Be gone long ? " Beargrease looks a little blank . " Oh , I do n't know . ' Bout an hour , maybe . " He smiles hopefully . " Naw , not long . " Only an hour ! I wave him off , then settle down to use the time wisely , thinking I 'll re-rig my bedroll and maybe write down a few notes . And the hour passes quickly . I 'm not waiting so much as expecting ; I 'm keeping a trust as I squat beneath a big oak , sucking down stale water , with the sweat oozing . And even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my mind , Beargrease has an hour 's grace ? even two . But when it stretches past three hours , it begins to prey on me , theheat and the waiting . Slithering up in hazy vanes from the ground , the heat is stunning , almost hypnotic . In that dry wind , I can hear the grass burning , fizzling like a field of tiny fuses , and every bird now driven from the sky . It 's past five when I awake , sprawled under the tree , smearing ants off my face . Then , as I sit up , 1 see some woman eyeing me from a stoop across the way . Oh , great ! She 's shaking out her lint mop and staring at me in disgust , probably about to call the cops . The door slams , and I sit there seething as tufts of lint slowly float across the field . Six hours ! Sure , it 's some lousy hobo initiation rite ! I can see them loitering in some air-conditioned Wendy 's , just cackling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't take it ! I 've worked myself into a fine fit when I hear Beargrease call over , " Hey , man ! How ya doin ' ? " He 's across the field with Slim . I must look like a shipwreck , staring at him . Fortunately , I 'm too surprised , then too relieved and worn out to deliver my fiery confrontation speech . And who can read them ? They 're both friendly and natural when I walk over , not even remotely apologetic . " Well , " says Slim , looking around . His voice has the slow , unflappable quality of an airline pilot over the cabin intercom . " Maybe you two ought a get some groceries . Get Bruce here somethin ' cold to drink . Yeah , I figger we 'll eat , get us a little nap , maybe catch out ' bout midnight . Should he nice and cool then . " We do a lot of waiting , as it turns out . Much of the hobo 's life is spent waiting and hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down , Slim decides . We 'll travel by night , like nocturnal animals . Late that night , we 're sleeping in a dry drainage ditch at the foot of the tracks , waiting for a train that Slim expects sometime after midnight . Slim 's not worried about oversleeping ? the train will wake us . Dressed and ready . we 're conked out , waiting for the rumblings of a fifty-ton wake-up call . SL lim and Beargrease go back a few years , actually . Watching them together , I sometimes wondered if , in a distant , distinctly unsentimental way , Slim did n't maybe feel somewhat fatherly toward his forty-six-year-old partner . It was Slim who had taught Beargrease how to ride " Old Dirty Face . " A veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars , Slim gave Beargrease his first lesson back in 1976 , a year after Beargrease had returned from Vietnam with his Vietnamese wife and three kids . After a decade of war , working as a contract machinist for the navy and Special Forces in places like Hue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the merchant marineBeargrease found stateside family life a virtual siege state . By the time he ran into Slim in a bar , he was bored stiff living with his family and working in the shipyards of Seattle . Of course Beargrease had had his share of drinking and allied excess over in Nam , but it was with Slim that the long slide really started . Soon they were drinking pals , drinking in the worst way . " Well , you know , " says Slim , his face getting twitchy at the mere thirsty thought of it . " We was drinking that tvhhhyy-ine . " In the same allusive way Slim talks about the melodious and complex sounds of trains , Slim rhapsodizes about cheap wine : " Oh , yeah , man ? MD 20-20 and Ripple ! Sweet Gallo and Mogen David , MMMM-wah ! ... And do lemme hear ya , Nee-ight Train Ex-press ! " That was some jumping , the rail-riding they did then in their old wining days . Together , they rode the trains blind . Blotto . Waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in places like Pasco , Washington , and Whitefish , Montana , with faces swollen , blue as grapes , and the sun like a cosh in their eyes . Beyond the craving for alcohol , though , it seems they both suffered a deeper , more uncon scious thirst . This was a thirst for the danger and excitement of war , for hardship and constant change . And maybe there 's something to be said for a little fear and excitement . A little ruckus can do wonders to keep the past at bay . Running through the yards can simulate that whooping combat feeling . Running and chasing down trains can summon that adrenaline rush of hunting and being hunted . It 's when we stop running that the dam seems to crack for old Slim ; it 's when he stops that the past comes thundering down like Niagara over him . Beargrease clued me in to Slim 's eccentric- Who 's the funky cowboy dude with the shades ? I guess it was the grubhy-assed hat , that and the outrageous grin , that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride west with them after the convention . With a dubious look over the top of his sunglasses , Beargrease glanced at Slim , then shrugged : " Well , I guess that 'd he okay . " Not exactly overjoyed : that was the feeling I got , from Slim especially . Slim was n't one of these safe , grandfatherly old hoboes now softened by civilization . No kid was gon na want to climb up on Slim 's lap . Slim still had the look ? I mean that unhenevolent , slightly submerged look of a man who meets you not eye to eye but like an elevator stuck between floors . I was n't surprised , then , when Beargrease mentioned Slim 's " moods . " Beargrease did n't say much . Mainly , he alluded to an unhappy end to Slim 's army career ? something to do with his drinking , I gathered . Also , there was a wife who had divorced him , then remarried him before dumping him for good . Most likely there were children , too , probably grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family or love hidden way back in the picture . Beargrease is divorced now , and his two oldest children are grown . But he still has his daughter , twelve-year-old Poppy , living with him on the little pig farm he runs outside Seattle . Ten or eleven months a year he still works at the shipyard ? many hoes go on and off the road and work far more than you 'd expect . Still , if Beargrease is more mainstream or social than Slim , this only makes him that much harder to read , in a perverse way , especially when he 'll start needling me , saying semi-funny , semi-nasty things . Whatever sparks it ? Slim 's moods , my intrusions , or just the tensions of the road ? I 'm learning that Beargrease also has quite an edge to him . That charm of his can he misleading : It lulls me into the illusion that we share the same basic values . Oo here we are again . In the Minneapolis yard , minutes after my comeuppance for that " easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two moving freights . Then the westbound train screeches to a halt , and Beargrease runs down ? Beargrease egi eonaoendds cc outt the line to find us aof the dark- " Here ! " got us one cape up he a pi te , ventilation rerao freight gsahn pet car ar two w ei with doors . both d open ? dual Beargrease is all smiles now . After a day struggling to get out of this two-mile-long yard , my two partners are probably more relieved than they 'd care to admit . " Hey , now ! " Bear-grease is calling back to Slim from the head of the car . " I hear it . We 're gettin ' air . " We all hear it , the whoosh of the air lines being hooked up to the brakes ? usually a sure sign of departure ? followed by the slow ticking of brake shoes releasing in drums . Then comes the slow rocking and wrenching of shocks and squeaking rivets . We 're off . " Well , all right ! " Now old Slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wounded recluse has turned into a grinning old devil with pop eyes . Peering back through the hanging door , gripping a cigarette in the side of his mouth , he gives his infernal blessing to the fiery red clouds hanging over Minneapolis : " Goodbye , Minny ! And bye to your goddamn twin sister , too ! " We 're all excited . I 'm whooping and slapping Beargrease on the back . " Look ! " Beargrease 's eyes are slits in the wind . " We got us two giant big-screen TVs tonight ! " Exploding before us , the land is a beautiful disaster . In the moonlight it has a forest-fire look , white-dark and foreflattened , with the queer infrared perspective of memory . I 'm swinging by the pulls along the walls ; I 'm yawning by those two giant doors , buffeted by the wind and speed . Trees and phone poles snap away ; in the whorling darkness , houses slowly rip loose and tumble off as in the teeth of a tornado . Away it roars in one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon flashing - ? lit lake ? boom-boom-turn ? waferish birches birch ? boom-be-bium-blarn ? white-faced cows in the moonlight ? he-boom-doom ? then a red-flas For twenty minutes we watch , but then it all goes to hell . As the train picks up speed , the car sets up a vibration that becomes a steady banging , then a violent slamming , then a bucking and shimmying in which you ca n't lie , stand , or sit . It 's awful . What we 're on , we realize , is a " bad order " car , the kind that creates derailments . Like a rubber hose , the steel floor wallops your feet , your side , your hands ; it sends you bumping with steady jerks toward the open door . Slim is smoking , lying stoically on his side on his sleeping bag , gutting it out . Recklessly lurching and stumbling around , meanwhile , Beargrease is chain-smoking , lunging here , then there , like a caged tiger . I 'm afraid he 'll be thrown out the door . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel the now familiar creep of something weird between us , a veiled , psyching-out , male head-hutting business . Leaning over rne , Beargrease shouts , " HEY , " then waits while I dig out the plugs . Then , with mock concern , he yells , " Know what to do in case of derailment ? " Sure , I know . We both know , and as I return his stare , I can hear an inner voice say , Yeah , you can kiss your sorry ass good-bye , motherfucker ! It 's a Mexican standoff . Beargrease laughs . Then , in a bluff , irritable way , I laugh , too . But Fm not just laughing , I 'm coughing ? I 'm suffering what amounts to an asthma attack , hacking and slobbering and sneezing , Maybe the tension is aggravating it . In all this corn and ragweed , my allergies have been on a rampage , and now their constant smoking is making it worse . But of course they know this . They can hear me wheezing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So finally I take the plunge : " Hey , think you guys could cool it with the cigarettes for a few minutes ? Just till I can get my sinuses together ? " I might as well ask for an easier train . They look at me and laugh . Fool , they seem to say . Now they 're teaching me a hobo lesson , one that drives far deeper than the usual tussles between smokers and abstainers . This lesson is as different as the rules are different , or utterly absent . Now I 've got two strikes against me , and Beargrease and Slim are merciless , their faces glowing red and spiteful , pulsing like neon signs in the darkness , as they fill the car with smoke . Here 's your freedom . Lying in that car then with the wheels beating up through the floor , I see the mean eyed face of this malign , unchecked freedom And slam , but you ca n't sleep . And slam , but then you are sleeping ? half-sleeping ? with anxiety dreams of failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking me . " Come on ! We 're getting off . " My flashlight has rolled off in the darkness , and my pack has spilled open . " Quickquick ? quick ? " Slim is out already . Standing by the open door , wreathed in the smoky blue vapor of the yard lamps , Beargrease is waving at me as I yank on boots and cinch up my pack : " Come on , willya ? They did n't break air . They 're liable to go any second . " Boots unlaced , I run for it . But when I jump down into the gassy blue darkness , my legs are cramped and wobbling . I feel as if I 'm reentering gravity after a period of prolonged weightlessness . It 's on all of us , this weight , Without a word , we make off , three leaning figures moving under the yard lights , through the clasping undergrowth , into the wide , flat fields beyond . A far wind is moving ? a fresh wind is lulling off the horizon , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tremors are still moving up my legs , but the land , the land is firm as we circle in the blowing darkness , each looking for a place to curl up . Nose up , Beargrease thinks it must he North Dakota . Sorta feels like Dakota , he says . Wetter and western . Cooler , maybe . And when I wake up the next morning , the clouds are gigantic big , fleecy , rolling clouds , and in the air , after days of heat , I can see my breath . Propped up on my elbows , I suddenly feel very excited . I 'm out West , boy , and I do n't know where l am , or care . Beargrease , meanwhile , is sitting a few feet away , smoking . His hag is rolled , and he 's coiled like a spring ? coiled to go , it seems . But with Slim curled up in that now familiar wounded way , Beargrease knows we ai n't going nowhere . That old black dog has got Slim had . Forget Slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mood . Rolling over then , I look at the land beyond ? soft meadowland ringed with bluish grass and peely white birches with pale , flickering leaves . Then I notice something dangling from a little scrub tree beside me . Hanging off one branch is the amber shell of a cicada that glued itself there while it molted . A cicada bug . Lying here , I find it vaguely eerie how this insect , so long interred , pins his old Judas life to a tree . It 's all here , the head and feelers , even the scratchy little insect legs . It 's complete in every detail , until you notice the REPORT 55 bag , Beargrease calls over quietly , " Hey , let 's get some breakfast . Just leave Slim . He do n't want nothin ' now . " Just beyond the little yard , there 's a large coffee shop . It 's not a bad place ? maybe a medium-nice place ? but in our present state , it 's way too nice tor us . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve and tug a comb through my matted hair . But in the mirror inside the doorway , 1 see it 's a lost cause . Beargrease is not so insecure . The minute we walk in , people are craning around , staring at him . It 's not just the nasty-looking shades , I realize , it 's the hat . Never in public will Bear-grease doff the magic hat : Samson knows better than to denude himself of his crowning power . And like any genuinely handsome man , Bear-grease naturally assumes that he is always magnetic . Gritty face . Black curls . Through that door , like an infusion , strides a life that feels itself to be as sweeping and grand as any movie . And possibly Beargrease feels I cramp his style . Once at the counter , he waits till 1 take a stool , then , cocking his leg like a cowboy , mounts the next stool over . But Beargrease may have a point , distancing himself from me . Instead of being proud of this well-earned filth I 'm wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I polite ! So precise and grammatical as our chubby , heavily made-up waitress pulls out her pad . I 'm not just ordering coffee and French toast . Inside I 'm croaking , Look , I 'm not a toad , I 'm a prince ! A good suburbanite , see ? But Beargrease knows his gamy power , this lord of the open road . Giving her his order , he leans forward . He uses his eyes and mystique , asking her faintly fondling questions and trifling indulgences . A little more cream ? And these biscuits , are they homemade ? At every pretext , she 's buzzing around , coquettishly pouring warm-ups , while 1 , big , smelly toad , must ask . Yet apparently I 'm not the only one feeling neglected . Again and again , I see men pandering at Beargrease , as if to say , Just who the hell do you chink you are , dirtbalk But grandly , Bear-grease ignores them , timid , envious souls . Sitting across from us is a heavy , red-faced man dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sopping up his egg yolk with his toast , Beargrease detects the man 's disapproving look . The hat flips up . Beargrease 's teeth flash . " Say , " he asks , sounding as if he 's out to settle a silly wager , " just where are we , anyway ? This North Dakota ? " The golfer stares at him . " Why , this is Dil-worth , Minnesota , " says the man . And then he laughs uneasily , as if to add , Yeah , space cowboy . And this is Planet Earth II he hotshot is n't your usual freight . It 's a highballing , top-priority , double-decker train , each car consisting of two compartments the size of semi-trailers , one stacked atop the other . I ca n't believe the size of it , massively tall and curving into the distance like the Great Wall . Riding on the elevated platform where the ends of two cars abut , high in the open air , 1 feel as if I 'm atop a giant stagecoach . " The Cadillac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy ride . 0 Within an hour , we 're well into North Dakota flat , flat black-soiled land , darkly lush in a vaguely bleak way . I see tumbleweed and patchy grasslands dotted with cattle . Then it 's corn , followed by immense yellow fields of nodding , black-eyed sunflowers , all facing in the same direction , tracking the westerly path of the sun . Propped back against his bedroll , Beargrease writes a letter to Poppy , then reads a few pages of James Michener 's Covenant . And soon the sky is big with fiery stars . But even more massive and penetrating than the stars is the darkness . Into that oceanic darkness , the train is roaring . Cascading through the slippery wet darkness , the train is now wedging in , bombarding down like a great breaker , roaring into deeper troughs of Dakota . And all the while the temperature is falling : Within the next hour , it must drop a good fifteen or twenty degrees , not even counting the windchill . But still I 'm fine , snoozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool cap , with a belly full of beans . I 'm fine until I 7 wake to a crack of thunder , then feel cold water dribbling down my neck . It 's a full-blown western electrical Poking my head out , I see long , white light , crazing and shattering like ice across the sky . My bag is getting soaked , but I 'll be okay ? I 've got rain gear . But then , as I 'm pulling out my poncho , I remember that Beargrease has nothing , not even a plastic sheet . Christ , he 's not even awake ! All through this barrage , he 's just snoring away , buried under a heap of soggy bedding . With the rain splattering across my face , I yell over , " Beargrease ! Hey , wake up , man ! You want my poncho ? You 're gon na get soaked and freeze ! " Nothing ! Even huddled under that mess , he hears me ? he must ? but Macho Man wo n't answer ! And I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Hardass here is still out to prove something ! No , it 's not the cold I 'll die from .

Freezing for nothing but a vile willfulness that makes me feel helpless , like a helium balloon shooting out into those black reaches where humanity finally explodes from its own insupportable AI LT arrogance . le got through that night , of course . And in retrospect , I ca n't say that Beargrease was out to prove anything . Very likely , he was just trytrain slowly climbed the Rocky Mountain foothills , I had a feeling we 'd passed a milestone . Or that I had , rather . Certainly there was less tension between Beargrease and me . Riding out now , we were almost pals again , joking and snapping pictures as the train slowly clacked up the mountainside . Even Slim was in better spirits . And , really , who could be in a bad mood , heading into the Rockies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the train labored up the dry , gray-humped foothills . And with every few hundred feet of elevation the land changed , going from knuckled buttes and deserty hills to hard blue lakes and meadows spread with flowers that glowed like dials in the sun . Was it telling that Slim 's black mood had suddenly lifted after that freezing night on the hotshot ? At dawn , as he climbed down , Slim 's face was red and smushed with the cold , like an old winter potato . Swaddled in his sleeping hag , Slim walked like a ghost across the tracks , then up the embankment , where he said gently , " It 's nice to stretch a bit , hah , fellas ? Well , why do n't you boys warm up and bring back a little coffee while 1 watch the gear . That 'd be mighty nice now , a little cuppa coffee . " I remember feeling ashamed then as I stood ing to get through a bad night without wasting warmth fussing . I was thinking of this two days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major shipping center on the Burlington Northern lines , Havre is a main stopover for boes ttaveling east and west , and it was there we had jumped off after that miserable night coming across North Dakota . And happily , something seemed to have changed among us in Havre . That day as our there eyeing him . Ashamed because my impulse was to curse them both for being so stupid as to ride an open car across country subject to temperature drops and violent thunderstorms . But neither uttered a word of complaint , nor gave . any indication that anything unforeseen or especially terrible had happened . Looking at them , I realized that the cold and hardships , and then the wonderful relief of having endured ? this for them was the marrow of life . make sense out of what Slim and Beargrease taught me . Besides crossing the Rockies , I passed another divide somewhere along the way . Somewhere I also passed the Great Divide of Innocence . I know it sounds strange for a man my age to speak of innocence . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented experience , it 's even more disorienting to have this dual , forking sense of an innocence that has been mixed with a little experience ? enough , anyway , to see how confused you still are , and how naive you were to start with . And there was another old , rather unwelcome lesson I was relearning as we climbed the Rockies . This was the realization that one must never be too shocked at what life can dish out . Toward the end , indeed , 1 was learning to rather like the hobo 's rough freedom . In a fool 's way , I was even feeling a hit cocky , as we ran from car to car , playing that shell game , Fool the Bull . But I was also learning not to be so shocked by a life that bears little resemblance to what it was , say , during the Depression , when it was common for hoboes to go door-knocking , offering to work in return for a bite to eat . I saw this the day before in Havre while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the line to suss things out . The yard was filled with boes . In the scrub oaks to my right was a pack of young dudes who had ridden in that afternoon . Real dangerous-looking zipper-heads , too , one vaguely Indian . looking and four others in heavy-metal dress dragging a cowering , malnourished dog . Gangway for the New Generation . Here we were in an area plainly at severe risk of wildfire , and they 're out scrounging wood for a fire . Burn the fucker down , they did n't care . Then came a crack in the brush behind me . Emerging from the trees , a big , fat hoe with a red , sousy-looking face called over : " Hey , man , you ought a come in here with us . That young hull , he 's bad news . He 's gon na git ya there . I 'd come over here , 1 was you . " Smoke was already curling through the trees as I thanked him and told him I had to wait on my partner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pyro neighbors were going to put Havre on the CBS Evening News , Beargrease returned . So did the fat hoe , who loudly renewed his offer . Did I suppose we were being invited for cocktails ? " Well , " I said , looking at Beargrease , " I 'm game if you are . " But here I was being crazy . " No thanks , man , " said Beargrease with a curt nod to the hoe . Shooting me a look , he started off . Then , once we were out of earshot , he chewed me out : " Do n't you ever fall for some line like that ! Man , he could have had a damned army back in that mess . They would n't find you till you were stinking ! " So here was another milestone past the little town of Innocence . The night before that , on the hotshot blasting across North Dakota , I had still been laboring under the misconception that hobo life was a kind of rough comradeship . But when Beargrease spurned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoes we 'd seen had been so spooky , skulking by like deer in deer season . No , the fellowship of the fabled old days is gone , pretty much . Sure , there are still the good , working hoes , especially your itinerant pickers , but theirs is an endangered species in a trip-wire world increasingly inhabited by criminals , winos , mental cases , and others running , stomped , or flushed down our social septic system . And really , where can a man or woman run anymore ? Today , a man or woman may flee debts , alimony , and even justice , but not even the hobo can escape the times we live in . What the hobo shows is that , know it or not , we all swim in the same unquiet sea . Idid n't want to admit it , but I 'd had enough We both knew it was gone , but then it was n't just the camera we were squaring away . With our trip drawing to a close , this mutual show of concern was perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the train briefly stopped along the river , Beargrease jumped off , saying , " Look , I 'm gon na check on Slim . I 'll see you in Whitefish , okay ? It ai n't far now . " Several hours later , as the train pulled up to the depot , I had all the gear together . But where were they ? Anxiously , I looked on both sides of the train . I even jumped down and peered under the wheels , looking for legs . Had we somehow gotten our signals crossed ? Or were they just waiting until the train pulled farther down the yard ? I jumped hack on as the train started . And then , with a sick feeling , I realized we were rapidly picking up speed , heading out of town . " Beargrease ! " I was craning over the side , calling down a curving wall of cars . " Heyyyy ? " Even if they were on board , they could n't hear me in that racket . Worse , it was growing colder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . " IDIOTS ! " I screamed . Whoom . I was swallowed in the pounding darkness of a tunnel filled with diesel fumes . Fortunately , Slim had prepared me for the tunnels . Hitting the deck to get under the fumes , I spat in my handkerchief , then slowly breathed through it . Light ! Air again ! Then , iv/worn ? more darkness . A short tunnel , then another shorty , followed by one that was starting to worry me when the train finally flew out the other side of the mountain . But still we were climbing , and it was growing steadily colder . Terrible as Beargrease felt about my camera , I now felt at the sight of his gear , but then maybe I 'd learned something these past few days . Like a scavenger yanking off a dead man 's boors , I pulled open his pack . I took out his food , unrolled his sleeping bag , then stuffed it and his clothes under me and began stuffing my face . In fact , as I sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of me . ? It was past midnight when we finally reached Spokane , and we split up there . Beargrease said he was going right back to Whitefish . Slim was bagging it and heading home to Seattle . " Now , look , " said Slim . " You can go with Grease or you can come with me . Or you can stay here . " I thanked them , but after riding for sixteen hours straight , I 'd had it . With that , we shook hands and parted . I wound up sleeping in the deserted lobby of Spokane 's little airport , which had closed for the night . There in the men 's room , I washed as best I could and put on a moderately clean shirt , but I was still looking pretty grubby the next morning as I waited for my flight . Stuck between worlds . That was the feeling I had . No , I had n't gone native , but in my blurred vision my world suddenly looked rather strange . From time to time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass at all these confident , well-dressed people . My people . People moving in great schools through the channels of a powerful life . But more disorienting was my feeling on the jet later as I watched the land slip by . Peering out that bubble of plexiglass , I could n't grasp it , the immensity of those hard miles gliding so effortlessly beneath the polished fuselage of this life of mine . And not just the miles but those same mountains I had passed through only hours before . Odd . Suddenly , those mountains made me think of those alpine cloisters where penitents renounce the world only to spend their lives praying for it . Prayer takes many forms ? kneeling , walking ? maybe even rail-riding . Yet how odd , when you think of it , that strangers should pray for us . Or , for that matter , that grandiose characters like Slim and Beargrease might somehow fancy themselves as being free for us . I do n't know who 's right . I ca n't say who 's really free , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , root-bound world that has somehow lost faith in the very myths it feeds on . But picture this : a train . . And there by the door , a scruffy man waving at you . Then ask yourself , Is the man waving hello ? Or is he waving good-bye ! Myself , l see a vanishing man , a tough , proud man with little respect for my life or its values . I see a man who rejects my life because to him it seems much too costly for what it 's worth , but who rejects it , above all , because for all its ease and relative safety , it strikes him as anything but free . I see a man traveling in circles maybe , but still putting down tracks . That 's something , I guess . Same old foot . But new prints , new prints .
