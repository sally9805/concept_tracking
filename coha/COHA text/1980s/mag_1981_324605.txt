A way to general ed <P> As chancellor of the sprawling State University of New York during the early 1970s , Ernest Boyer often met with angry students who demanded the abolition of required courses . Boyer disagreed . But he also took seriously complaints that " general education " courses ( courses supposed to be broad enough to benefit all students ) were often little more than rehashes by junior faculty members of their recent Ph.D . dissertations . He still does . " Students have not abandoned general education , " Boyer concludes , " general education has abandoned them . " <P> Now the new president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , Boyer has launched a crusade for general education . On most campuses , he says , it has become a cluttered " spare room " thoughtlessly located in student schedules somewhere between electives and degree-program courses . Boyer kicked off his crusade last week at a conference for 200 scholars and foundation executives at the University of Chicago . Participants received a 68-page Carnegie essay touting general education as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its message : " All students should come to understand that they share with others the use of symbols , membership in groups and institutions , the activities of production and consumption , a relationship with nature , a sense of time , and commonly held values and beliefs . " <P> Many educators give lip service to such familiar and useful aims . Boyer 's main point , though , is that most colleges ignore them in the day-to-day business of planning curriculums . Instead of thinking about how best to provide a general education , most colleges , says Boyer , merely turn students loose to choose from a grab bag of courses that make the approved list as a result of academic politics . In planning student programs , explains Carnegie Senior Fellow Arthur Levine , " at most schools , three credits in economics is the same as three in political science . Biology is equivalent to physics . You can satisfy humanities requirements with Shakespeare or science fiction , Faulkner or an introduction to film . It does n't matter . But it should .

Sums up Chicago 's Dean Jonathan Smith , " To dump on students the task of finding coherence in their education is indefensible . Colleges should n't be allowed to collect tuition on that basis .
