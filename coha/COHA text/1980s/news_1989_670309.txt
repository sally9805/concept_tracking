WASHINGTON  --  Harris Trust &; Savings Bank , Chicago , settled longstanding discrimination charges by agreeing to pay $14 million in back pay to women and minority-group workers , the Labor Department said . The settlement is the largest ever in a federal race or sex discrimination case involving one employer . It requires the bank , a unit of Harris Bankcorp Inc. , to make back wage payments to women and minority-group members it employed between May 1973 and December 1988 . Solicitor of Labor George Salem said " a few thousand " people probably will receive the compensation , although the department won ' t know exactly how many are eligible until it sees the bank ' s payroll records . The bank also agreed to change its hiring and promotion policies to offset underrepresentation of women and minorities in higher-ranking jobs . In addition , it agreed to end " disparate treatment " of women and minorities in the future , and to set up training programs designed to improve their advancement opportunities . Harris agreed to the settlement without admitting any wrongdoing . Kenneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he wasn ' t pleased with the decision . " It ' s hard to be pleased with parting with $14 million when you don ' t think that you ' re guilty , and I still don ' t think we are guilty of systemic , broad discrimination against minorities and women , " he said . Mr. West said Harris decided to settle the case because of huge estimated court costs . " We looked down the road and saw a lengthy court battle , " he said . " Now we can get along with our business . " Department officials said the case was built on statistical evidence showing that Harris placed women and minorities in more lowly jobs than white men  --  even when they had similar education and employment backgrounds . Consequently , it said , the women and minorities were paid less . The case was one of the first in a series brought by advocacy groups challenging the compliance of several banks with federal affirmative-action and anti-discrimination requirements , according to the National Women ' s Law Center , a women ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last to be settled . The center represents Women Employed , a Chicago group that initiated the case by filing a complaint with the department in 1974 . The enforcement action was brought under a 1965 presidential order requiring federal contractors to refrain from discriminating against minorities and women in hiring , promotion and wage policies . The bank is considered a federal contractor because it holds federally insured deposits . In 1985 , then Attorney General Edwin Meese and others in the Reagan administration urged President Reagan to repeal the order , but then Labor Secretary William Brock successfully defended it . Mr. Salem said the settlement underscores that the executive order is " vital , viable and one with which companies doing business with the government must comply . " A Labor Department administrative law judge found in 1981 that Harris had engaged in illegal discrimination . Then Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan remanded the case to the law judge in 1983 , holding that the bank was wrongly denied permission to introduce certain statistical studies into evidence . Nahum Litt , the Labor Department ' s chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris had violated the executive order . Last March , Mr. Salem estimated that the back-pay obligation could rise well above $20 million . The $14 million is a " compromise " figure , he said yesterday . The settlement will go into an escrow account 10 days after the signing of the agreement , which was done Monday , according to the bank ' s Mr. West .
