Rock fans may find it shocking , but Frank Zappa , 43 , the bent mind behind Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Valley Girl , has gone legit . This week California 's Berkeley Symphony Orchestra performs the world premiere of A Zappa Affair , a program of four short ballets . Zappa may have jettisoned the synthesizers and electric guitars , but he has kept his famous sense of the absurd . The ballets-titled Moe ' n ' Herb 's Vacation , Sinister Footwear , Bob in Dacron and Sad Jane-are performed by giant puppets attached to live performers . " There are a lot of things you can do with puppets that you ca n't do with dancers , " explains Zappa . " In one scene a bartender gets so busy that he 's torn in half . Most dancers would have a hard time with that one . " Still , old-time Zappers who fear that the long-haired composer is about to change his record label to Deutsche Grammophon have nothing to fear . Says the mangy maestro : " I still enjoy making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting a tuxedo or a baton grafted onto my body . " <P> ? <P> It was the most unglamorous role ever offered to her , but that did not stop Farrah Fawcett , 37 , from starring in The Burning Bed . The TV movie concerns the true story of Francine Hughes , who endured vicious beatings by her husband until she finally murdered him . Fawcett was up to the acting demands of the part , but transforming the blond beauty into a convincingly battered wife was no easy task . " Her features are absolutely perfect , " observes Makeup Artist Fred Blau . " It 's like putting your foot through a Rembrandt . " To make the star considerably less perfect , Blau darkened her eyes , created bruises on her cheeks , neck and arms , and added false , crooked teeth " to take away from her Pepsodent smile . " The temporarily fallen angel had no regrets , however . Says Fawcett : " It would be depressing to go through life with the same hairdo . " <P> ? <P> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the races or fishing in Scottish streams , but the Queen Mother , 83 , can handle a cue when the occasion calls for it . While on a three-day tour of the Channel Islands , she popped into a young people 's center in Jersey . There she was cheekily challenged to a game of pool by Karl Megaw , 17 . The regal reply : " Certainly . " As she lined up the shot , she murmured , " Would n't it be awful if I missed ? , " then proceeded to render the question academic as she slammed the ball into the side pocket . " I offered her a shot because I heard she played , " said Megaw afterward . " You could see how good she is . " Also impressed with the Queen Mum 's technique was former U.K. Snooker Champion John Virgo . Said he : " She 's a natural . If she had taken up the game a little earlier , she might have been a champ . " Some say she is e'en now . <P> ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
