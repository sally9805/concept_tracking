txt American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. will reach agreement on court-suggested changes necessary for final approval of the company 's antitrust settlement with the government . AT &T's; chairman . Charles L. Brown , predicted . Mr. Brown , speaking a day after federal Judge Harold Greene stipulated several changes before he would approve the proposed settlement , stopped short of endorsing all the judge 's recommendations . In particular , he said , AT &T; had n't reached a conclusion about the judge 's requirement that local Bell companies , after their divestiture. from AT &T.; be allowed to market telephone equipment to business and residential customers . " After all we 've been through , to have the thing run aground at this late date would be very frustrating , " Mr. Brown said in an interview . " I find it hard to accept that would happen . " Earlier , appearing on the Public Broadcasting System 's Report . Mr. Brown said he would " find it hard to believe we ( AT &T; and the Justice Department ) would n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative was resumption of the " prolonged seige " of the government 's eight-year-old antitrust suit against AT &T,; and added , " We surely do n't want that again . " Judge Greene . who was hearing the antitrust trial in Washington , is reviewing the proposed Jan. 8 antitrust agreement between AT &T; and the Justice Department under provisions of a federal law requiring court approval of consent decrees . The judge ca n't order changes in the agreement 's provisions but can require the two parties to agree on changes , as Judge Greene did Wednesday , before granting approval . Among the changes requested by Judge Greene were that Bell 's 22 local telephone operating companies , which are to be divested under the agreement , be allowed to retain the lucrative Yellow Pages advertising business . In addition , the judge said AT &T; should be restricted for at least sevenyears from originating most news or advertising material that it transmits over AT &T's; long-distance lines . Mr. Brown said that prohibiting the divested Bell units from continuing in the Yellow Pages business was " always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he did n't oppose the judge 's recommendation . Yellow Pages advertising is expected to show earnings of $1.5 billion in each of the next two years , Mr. Brown said . Regarding Judge Greene 's recommendation barring AT &T; from the information-origination business using its phone lines , Mr. Brown said AT &T; did n't expect to enter the field in any event . Mr. Brown said AT &T; had received no formal reaction from the Justice Department regarding the judge 's recommendations . contained in a 178-page order . He said he expected company attorneys would meet with William F. Baxter . head of the Justice Department 's antitrust division , as early as Sunday . Mr. Baxter has been attending an American Bar Association meeting in California . Judge Greene gave the parties 15 days to notify him whether they would accept his recommended changes . Mr. Brown expressed confidence that company and government attorneys have sufficient time to prepare a joint response for the judge . The AT &T; chairman said the major change in the judge 's recommendations from the original proposed agreement involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units . The proposed settlement had reserved that business for AT &T,; whereas the recommended change would allow all 22 local Bell operating companies to compete with AT &T.; Mr. Brown said he could n't elaborate on the difficulties he saw in this alteration . " I do n't know what the problem is , " Mr. Brown said , noting that the company had had only one day so far to review the matter . But he added , " In a change of this magnitude there are bound to be some difficulties . "
