When Democrat Michael Boyle , 43 , won his second term as mayor of Omaha in 1985 , some supporters touted him as a candidate for Governor of Nebraska . In the past year , however , Boyle 's erratic behavior convinced most Omahans that he was unfit even for city hall . Among other embarrassing incidents , the mayor fired the police chief in a feud over traffic tickets issued to his family , and was seen tossing a pat of butter at a county official during a dinner meeting . Last October a citizens ' committee charged Boyle with abuse of power , denounced him as " irresponsible , petty and at times downright childish " and called for his ouster . <P> Although Boyle promised to reform , Omaha voters went to the polls in record numbers last week for a recall election . By a convincing tally of 55,275 votes to 42,832 , they turned Boyle out . The city council will appoint a new mayor .                  @ @ @
