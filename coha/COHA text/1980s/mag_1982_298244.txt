Armenian terrorists conduct a fearsome campaign of violence <P> The hatred is venomous , relentless and overwhelming . When Armenian Terrorist Levon Ekmekjian was told by Turkish police that his two-man murder squad had succeeded in killing nine people and wounding 72 others , he cried out furiously , " It was n't enough ! " <P> The terrorists had exploded a bomb in the middle of the crowded check-in area at Ankara 's Esenboga Airport on Aug. 7 , then opened fire with submachine guns on passport-control officers and passengers , mostly Turkish workers returning to jobs in West Germany and The Netherlands after a holiday . One of the gunmen was reported to have yelled at his victims as he fired , " More than a million of us died ! What 's the difference if 25 of you die ? " <P> The airport killers were members of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ( ASALA ) , one of several underground groups that are eager for vengeance against Turks for the murder of more than 1 million Armenians in 1915 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists began in 1973 to carry out systematic assassinations of Turkish envoys . Their goal : forcing the Turks to acknowledge committing the act of genocide , to pay reparations to the descendants of the victims , and to grant autonomy to the former Armenian-dominated provinces in northeastern Turkey or give them up altogether so they might become a separate nation . The Marxist , Beirut-based ASALA and another group called the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide have killed 22 Turkish diplomats or members of their families and staffs , and have wounded 15 other envoys or their dependents . In addition , there have been 70 casualties , including four deaths , among people who , though not Turkish , were in the terrorists ' line of fire . Four of the killings have taken place in the U.S. The most recent : the murder in Somerville , Mass. , last May of Orhan Gunduz , a Turkish gift-shop owner , who was also honorary Turkish consul general for New England . <P> France , which is home for 300,000 Armenians , has been the major battlefield for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 40 attacks on Turks or Turkish facilities and killed four diplomats . Last September , Armenian terrorists killed a security guard , wounded the vice consul and held 51 people hostage while they occupied the Turkish consulate for 15 hours . <P> France 's inability to protect the Turkish diplomatic community from terrorist attack has outraged the Ankara government . Turkish-French relations were further strained last April by a speech that French Interior Minister Gaston Defferre gave at a ceremony in Marseilles honoring the Armenians who died in 1915 . Said Defferre : " The French government recognizes the genocide of which the Armenian people have been victim . " The Turkish Foreign Minister protested that Defferre was " contributing to an atmosphere that encourages Armenian violence . "
