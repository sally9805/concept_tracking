txt The Civil Aeronautics Board tentatively approved an Air Florida bid to buy Western Airlines . The CAB said it will issue an order directing any opponents to show why the merger should n't get final board approval . Interested parties will have 45 days to make any such comments . If approved by the agency , the acquisition may require backing by President Reagan because international routes are involved . Air Florida said it has acquired 11.6% of Western 's shares outstanding . The company said in early July that it acquired 9.9% of Western , or about 1.3 million shares outstanding , for $15 million . Then president Edward Acker said at that time that the company intended to buy at least a majority of Western and added that he was optimistic Air Florida could acquire all of the California-based company . An Air Florida spokesman said that goal remains unchanged despite Mr. Acker 's recent decision to leave Air Florida to become chairman of Pan American World Airways . " We have every intention to acquire Western in a peaceable fashion , " said Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier that recently expanded its route network to become an interstate and international airline . It had tried unsuccessfully to buy a controlling interest in Piedmont Aviation and was outbid when it tried to buy Air California in a bankruptcy sale . For its part , Western previously had agreed to merge with Continental Airlines , but that plan was thwarted when Texas International Airlines , a Texas Air Corp . unit , made a competing bid . In mid-July , the CAB gave Air Florida clearance to buy as much as 50% of Western 's stock . But the board required that the holdings be placed in a voting trust to prevent Air Florida from exercising immediate control over Western . In Los Angeles , Western Air said it " will vigorously oppose this tentative decision , " and said the issues involved are " much too complex and too crucial " to its employes and stockholders to receive expedited treatment . In a statement , the airline said that the CAB should use the same public hearing procedure it has used in deciding other recent airline merger cases so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matters can be discussed .
