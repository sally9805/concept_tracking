THE LONG WAIT <P> One spring night in 1937 , soon after Isidore Zimmerman of New York City had received a scholarship to attend Columbia University , his mother told him that the police wanted to talk to him . He reported to the local precinct and then quickly found himself in jail . One year later , Zimmerman and four other youths were sentenced to death for the first-degree murder of a police detective . <P> <P> All along , Zimmerman insisted that he was innocent . Then just two hours before Zimmerman was to be executed in Sing Sing 's electric chair , Governor Herbert Lehman commuted his death sentence . Zimmerman went on to become a celebrated jailhouse lawyer , and in 1962 , after New York State 's highest court ruled that he had been the victim of perjured testimony , he was set free . Total time served : nearly 25 years . <P> Since the prosecutor had known that the testimony was false , Zimmerman believed that New York should compensate hIn for wrongful imprisonment . The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York legislature to pass a special law allowing him to sue . Three times the legislators voted the bill , and three times then Governor Nelson Rockefeller vetoed it . Last week Governor Hugh Carey signed the fourth bill . Lawyers on both sides agree that Zimmerman is likely to win his case . The only question is whether he will be awarded as much as the $10 million he is seeking . Whatever he gets , the money will be welcome to Zimmerman , 63 , who now works as a doorman at a Manhattan apartment house . <P> <P> ROPING RAPISTS <P> <P> Very few of the 76,000 annual rape cases in the U.S. end in conviction . One reason is the frequent lack of evidence . But Illinois prosecutors may have a remedy . <P> Emergency room staffs in at least 220 of the state 's 300 hospitals now use the Vitullo Evidence Collection Kit , named after Louis Vitullo , a former Chicago police sergeant who helped devise it . The kit comes in a book-size cardboard box and includes slides , evidence bags and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood samples , hairs , fingernail scrapings and bodily smears . While it is still too early to gauge the success of the kit , convictions were obtained in three early test cases in which it was used . Yet a lack of funds for the kits , which cost $5.25 each , may stop their national distribution . Much of the start-up money for the Illinois program came from the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration , which in 1980 became a victim of Washington budget cuts . The program has also lost its other original benefactor : the Playboy Foundation .
