Psychologist Paul Ekman ran the film over and over until he found the clue . Mary , a housewife who had attempted suicide three times and had been confined to a mental institution , appeared chipper and confident onscreen as she asked - her doctor for a weekend pass . Her interview , secretly shot for research purposes , was so convincing that Mary got the pass , but she subsequently admitted that she had been lying and had wanted to get away for another suicide try . By slowing down the film , Ekman found that Mary 's face had sagged into despair , a telltale " microexpression " that lasted only one twenty- fourth of a second . Later he found other quick movements of deceit : part of a hand shrug , the brief lift of a shoulder . <P> In his new book Telling Lies ( W.W. Norton ; $17.95 ) , Ekman , 51 , a professor of psychology at the University of California at San Francisco , says that catching liars is an art that anyone can learn : most duplicitous people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The key to judging sincerity is in paying close attention to the signals issuing from a talker 's face , body and voice . In one of Ekman 's experiments , all 50 members of a group of volunteers learned to pick up revealing microexpressions as brief as one twenty-fourth of a second . " Liars , " he says , " usually do not monitor , control and disguise all of their behavior . " Ekman 's lessons come with one large caveat : even the best liar catchers can not be right 100% of the time . The ear tugger , the evasive rambler and the fellow who refuses to look you in the eye may be lying , but they may instead be fidgety truth tellers who are afraid of being accused of deceit . The person who rubs his nose every 30 seconds may be dissembling , or he may simply be displaying a lifelong nervous habit . Diplomats , natural performers and pathological liars are often impossible to read . Says Ekman : " We live in a probabilistic world . You 're only going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler , Ekman believes , was good at lying because of his ability to hide his emotions . British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , duped by Hitler at Munich in 1938 , once wrote , " Here was a man who could be relied upon when he had given his word . " ) <P> Still , Ekman offers many useful guidelines for sorting out everyday liars . Among his tips : <P>  --  A prolonged smile or look of amazement that lingers is probably false . Almost all authentic facial expressions fade after four or five seconds . In Ekman 's theory , there are 18 kinds of authentic smiles . <P>  --  The body gestures and facial expressions of liars are often out of sync . The person who bangs the table but then waits a split second to produce an angry face is probably faking . <P>  --  Crooked , or asymmetrical , facial expressions are usually deceitful ( see box ) . <P>  --  In 70% of people tested , the pitch of the voice rose slightly when they were upset , afraid or angry , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
