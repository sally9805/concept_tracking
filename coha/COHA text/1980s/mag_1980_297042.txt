Kosygin resigns in favor of a Brezhnev yes man <P> Once there were three . After Nikita Khrushchev 's ouster in 1964 , the mantle of Soviet leadership fell to a power-sharing troika : Leonid Brezhnev as Communist Party chief , Nikolai Podgorny as President , and Alexei Kosygin as Prime Minister . Slowly and then surely , Brezhnev emerged as the dominant figure . In 1977 , Podgorny was shunted aside and Brezhnev added the presidency to his other powerful post , relegating Kosygin to a much diminished role . Last week the troika became one . <P> The announcement came , fittingly enough , from Brezhnev himself , who after 16 years at the helm has proved to be the most durable Soviet leader since Joseph Stalin . Addressing 1,500 delegates to the biannual session of the Supreme Soviet in the Kremlin , Brezhnev announced that Kosygin , 76 , was stepping down " on the grounds of his health , which has recently worsened .

Kosygin and former President Anastas Mikoyan are the only top Kremlin leaders who are known to have left office voluntarily . <P> Kosygin also asked to resign from the Politburo ; that request will probably be taken up at the next party congress in February . The retiring Premier is believed to have suffered two heart attacks in the past four years , and has long been afflicted by painful circulatory ailments . Kosygin 's absences from public view have become more frequent and prolonged . " He has been trying to resign for some time , " a family friend explained last week . " He just wanted to rest and fish . " <P> Kosygin 's replacement by a man only a year younger once again dramatized the aging fragility of the Soviet leadership . Although he has appeared robust and vigorous in his recent public appearances , Brezhnev is 73 and suffers from a host of ailments , reportedly including cancer of the jaw and heart disease .

If anything , it was expected to enhance Brezhnev 's own already dominant power . A master of political survival , who was said by Dissident Leader Andrei Sakharov to be " the most intelligent and toughest man in the Politburo , " Kosygin periodically differed with Brezhnev both on economic and foreign policy . In 1968 , for instance , he was thought to have opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia . <P> In Tikhonov , Brezhnev has acquired the nearest thing to a tried and tested yes man . Tall , square-faced and self-effacing , the veteran technocrat has little foreign and defense policy experience ; he has been known as a Brezhnev proteg ever since the two studied metallurgical engineering at neighboring technical institutes in the Ukraine in the 1930s . He became deputy chairman of GOSPLAN , the state planning committee , in 1963 , a Deputy Premier in 1965 and a full member of the Politburo last November . By then , as First Deputy Premier , he had already become Kosygin 's virtually full-time standin.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
