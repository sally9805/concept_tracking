As a young biology professor in 1960 , Donald Kennedy left a tenured job at Syracuse University for an untenured one at Stanford . " A lot of people thought I was crazy , " he recalls . But at the hot , fast-evolving Palo Alto institution , he explains , " you got the sense that anything was possible . " Last week in the elegant corner office of University President Donald Kennedy , it seemed that anything had indeed been possible , and would continue to be so . " I love it , " exults Kennedy , 56 , about the sprawling campus and his action-packed position . " I grew up here scientifically . " <P> Born in New York City and graduated from outdoorsy Dublin School in New Hampshire ( " We did a lot of woodcutting " ) , Kennedy entered Harvard to study English literature . But he switched to biology and stayed on for a Ph.D. , meanwhile coaching the Harvard ski team . In contrast to today 's microbiologists , Kennedy says , he took the old-fashioned " butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic ladder at Syracuse and then Stanford , where he became provost in 1979 . En route he detoured to Washington , first as a science adviser to Gerald Ford , then as Food and Drug Administration commissioner under Jimmy Carter . In the latter role , he was a strong public-interest spokesman , opposing use of ozone-damaging fluorocarbon sprays and favoring regulation of such cancer-linked substances as saccharin and sodium nitrate . <P> When Stanford tapped him as president in 1980 , he continued to take on tough issues , pushing the hiring of women and minority professors . He joined other university presidents in exploring possible ethical conflicts in commercially sponsored research and refusing government research contracts with restrictive clauses about publication . He has navigated such shoals by combining a firm hand with a collegial deference to his faculty that has spared him much of the president-bashing common to academe . <P> Personally , Kennedy has endured gossip preceding his marriage last fall to Stanford Lawyer Robin Hamill , 41 . He wed her two months after divorcing his wife of 34 years and the mother of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close the chasm between Stanford 's powerful scientific-technical community and its humanities disciplines . For all his accomplishments , Kennedy is modest about his role at the university : " I can steer it a bit , but I could n't redirect it if I wanted to . " Yet all signs are that the Kennedy touch will keep the tight ship that is Stanford moving handsomely forward .
