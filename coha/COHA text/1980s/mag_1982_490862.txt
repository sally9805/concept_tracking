Notes and Comment THE pianist and composer Thelonious Monk , who died last week , at the age of sixty-four , was an utterly original man who liked to pretend he was an eccentric . Indeed , he used eccentricity as a shield to fend off a world that he frequently found alien , and even hostile . A tall , dark , funny , bearish , inward-shining man , he wore odd hats and dark glasses with bamboo frames when he played . His body moved continuously . At the keyboard , he swayed convulsively back and forth and from side to side , his feet flapping like flounders on the floor . While his sidemen soloed , he would stand by the piano and dance , turning in slow , genial circles , his elbows out like wings , his knees slightly bent , his fingers snapping on the after-beat . His motions celebrated what he and his musicians played : Watch , these are the shapes of my music , His compositions and his playing were of a piece . His improvisations were molten Monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His medium-and up-tempo tunes are stop-and-go rhythmic structures . Their melodic lines , which often hinge on flatted notes , tend to be spare and direct , but they are written with strangely placed rests and unexpected accents . They move irregularly through sudden intervals and retards and broken rhythms . His balladlike tunes are altogether different . They are intense and graceful art songs , which move slowly and three-dimensionally . They are carved sound . ( Monk 's song titles ? " Crepuscule with Nellie , " " Epistrophy , " " Ruby , My Dear , " " Well You Need n't , " " Rhythm-a-ning , " " Hackensack " ? are as striking as the songs themselves . But none match his extraordinary name , Thelonious Sphere Monk , which surpasses such euphonies as String-fellow Barr and Twyla Tharp . ) His improvisations were ingenious attempts to disguise his Love of melody . He clothed whatever he played with spindly runs , flatted notes , flatted chords , repeated single notes , yawning silences , and zigzag rhythms . Sometimes he pounded the keyboard with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his love of melody but from his love of the older pianists he grew out of  --  Duke Ellington and the stride pianists and the likes of Art Tatum . All peered out from inside his solos , but he let them escape only in the form of parody . Monk hid himself so well behind his music that we know little of him . He was brought from North Carolina when he was little , he eventually settled in the West Sixties , and he lived there until his building was torn down . He married the Nellie of his song title , and he had two children , one of whom became a drummer . He began appearing in New York night clubs around 1940 , but he achieved little recognition until the late fifties . ( He was often lumped with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie ; however , he did not have much in common with them outside of certain harmonic inventions . ) Part of the reason for Monk 's slow blooming was his iconoclastic music , and part was the fact that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1957 ? the time when Charles Mingus and the Modern Jazz Quartet and Gerry Mulligan were coming to the fore . ( The police had lifted his cabaret card , because he had been found sitting in a car in which narcotics were concealed . ) But he exploded when he returned to the scene , and he suddenly seemed to be everywhere  --  on record after exceptional record , at concerts and festivals , at the old Five Spot and the Vanguard and the Jazz Gallery . lie filled us with his noble , funny , generous music . His attendance record in night clubs was spotty ( he was often late , and sometimes he did n't show up at all ) , but the cumulative excellence of his playing made him a standard against which to measure all jazz . Then , in 1973 , he vanished again . There were rumors that he was ill and had been taken in by his old friend and mentor the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter , who lives in a big house in Weehawken , New Jersey . The rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baroness had to say about Monk one day last fall : " No doctor has put his finger on what is wrong with him , and he has had every medical test under the sun . He 's not unhappy , and his mind works very well . He knows what is going on in the world , and I do n't know how , because he does n't read the newspapers and he only watches a little telly . He 's withdrawn , that 's all . It 's as though lie had gone into retreat . He takes walks several times a week , and his wife , Nellie , comes over from New York almost every day to cook for him . He began to withdraw in 1973 , and he has n't touched the piano since 1976 . He has one twenty or thirty feet from his bed , so to speak , but he never goes near it . When Barry Harris visits , he practices on it , and he 'll ask Monk what the correct changes to Ruby , My Dear ' are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old tenor saxophonist , came to see him on his birthday the other day , but Monk is n't really interested in seeing anyone . The strange thing is he looks beautiful . He has never said that he wo n't play the piano again . He suddenly went into this , so maybe he 'll suddenly come out . " But Monk must have known he would n't . His last public appearance , at the Newport Jazz Festival of 1976 , was painful . His playing was mechanical and uncertain , and , astonishingly , his great Gothic style had fallen away . His very soul had gone , and he never found it again . ? ? Waterfront AFRIEND writes : You think New York can be cold ? Try the waterfront of Portland , Maine , at six-thirty in the morning . I was driving down Commercial Street last week  --  passing through  --  bumping along over ice and cobblestones and , in places , old trolley tracks or train tracks curving toward the wharves . Blocks of beautiful brick buildings here  --  lots of respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I parked in front of a snowbank at Casco Bay Lines ( " Scenic Cruises  --  Serving 365 Maine Islands " ) . Across the way , on the corner of Pearl Street , was a three-story Victorian sliver that might have been plucked from the old Executive Office Building in Washington . " United States Custom House , " said gold letters on its fa  --  ade . Snow was sticking to its stone railings and cornices all the way up , and it looked vacant . Harbor Lunch , a few yards away , appeared to be open and fully occupied . On the door was a list of the hours : " 5-2 Daily , Except Sat . and Sun . ( 5-12 ) . " Inside were a long counter , tables , booths . Steamy , warm , and crowded . Sign on wall : " Steak Dinner $3.49 . " Customers in wool hats , sweaters , down vests ; nobody had removed more than the top layer . Lots of talk ; people glad to be indoors . A waitress in a heavy white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's hard to get up at three , to get here at four , so we can open at five for the fishermen , " she said . " They 're usually gone by five-thirty or six , but if it 's rough they just stay in here until the weather clears . " Outside again , I crossed Commercial Street and turned down a narrow , snow-clogged street leading onto a wharf . Pungent . Peered into windows of Harbor Fish Market ( " We Pack Live Lobster to Travel " ) . It was dark MARCH I , 1982 inside , but piles of ice were gleaming in metal bins , waiting for fish . Salted cod in plastic bags were hanging from the ceiling like albino bats . A sign said , " Fresh Cusk Fillet $1.49 . " ( Is that steep for fillet of tusk ? Or a bargain ? What 's tusk ? ) Suddenly , the street was full of bundled-up people coming out of a doorway , some with backpacks , others carrying bags or briefcases ; two young men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the doorway and came to an open dock with Y-shaped pillars and red-painted benches . It was the landing for Casco Bay Lines . " Loose Commutation Tickets Will Not Be Accepted , " said a sign . Another said : Please Remain Seated Until Boat Is Tied Up Or If Standing Brace Yourself . Casco Bay Lines . The Island Holiday , a sixty-five-foot boat , had apparently just docked . A young fellow was sweeping ice off the gray forward deck . " This boat came in from Peak 's Island , " he told me . " That 's an outlying section of Portland . " A second boat turned into the slip . " Island Romance , " it said on the stern , and it seemed to be empty ; nobody was on deck . But as soon as it hit the pier a door opened and people surged from belowdecks as if coming up out of an I.R.T. stop . There were thirty or forty of them ; they filed up the gangplank and headed into Portland . A small woman with rosy cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by the entrance of Casco Bay Lines , looking down the street . " My son is supposed to pick inc up , " she said . She had a full-sized wooden door with her , leaning against the wall ; I had missed seeing how she managed to get it ashore . " I came from Cliff Island , " she said . " It 's an hour 's ride . The island is a couple of miles long and about half a mile wide . Around eighty people live there in the winter . There 's just one small store . The school only goes through the eighth grade ; 40 MARCH 1.1982 and I went ' Oh , no . ' That was supposed to be kind of the knockout punch of my paper . Instead , I had to suddenly cross out everything that had to do with 1 and the relationship to single primes . So it 's mid-November , the paper 's due in mid-December , and I 'm suddenly back to mid-August . And not only that  --  I 've suddenly gone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was that once I found out that the constant was n't 1 , there either was n't a constant , and then I had no paper at all , or there was one , but I might not find it in time , in which case I still had no paper . I was dismayed . So  --  for no reason except curiosity , I guess  --  I just thought I 'd try my formula on the numbers starting at SO X 10% which is eighty billion , and then down in intervals of ten billion to 70 X 10 ' , 60 X 10 ' , and so on . I ran them all at once , and as I read down the column a moment later on the printout I suddenly realized there was a constant . It was n't 1 , it was 1.255 . It just hit me over the head : 1.255 ; 1.255 ; 1.255 . All in a row . And then , just like that , I was back from half a paper to a whole paper again . " Hotel ALUNCHEON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an East Forty-eighth Street , which used to he the Barclay . A handsome woman with an executive position on the staff of the new hotel scanned the hotel 's Vanderbilt Room  --  one of several rooms in which the luncheon was being held  --  from its threshold . " This used to be the premises of the Manhattan Club , " she told a companion . " It had a tartan-type carpet on the floor , and it was really on its last legs , We spent thirty million dollars on the hotel altogether . I do n't think anywhere else in Manhattan there is a suite of conference rooms like the one here , and we are very , very proud of it . We even fixed the birdcage in the lobby . It used to be famous , you know . ' Meet me by the birdcage at the Barclay ' was like saying ' Meet me under the clock at the Biltmore . ' So that was also part of the renovation  --  to have the cage restored and get some decent birds in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Intercontinental Hotels Corporation , told us , " My responsibility is to see to all the inte riors of all the hotels . There are twenty-three of them . Think of id Along with other designers , I have done the interiors of twenty-three hotels . From Bali to Zagreb . Zagreb is my favorite , and no one ever sees it . This particular hotel is in a style reminiscent of that found in the marvellous old homes of the city at the time the Barclay was built . I wanted the names of the conference rooms to reflect those of the great New York families , whose names have also been perpetuated in streets  --  the Vanderbilts , the Suttons , the Beek-mans . Harold S. Vanderbilt had an apartment on the top floor of this building . It 's since been destroyed , but the Vanderbilt family controlled New York Central , which built the Commodore and the Biltmore and arranged for the building of the Barclay , and this is where he chose to live . Ernest Hemingway stayed here . So did Gloria Swanson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all feather boas and pink satin . " Fred Peden , the vice-president and general manager of the new hotel , delivered a brief talk . The Barclay was the New York City home of West Point cadets , he said , and in the lobby was the oldest pharmacy in New York  --  Caswell-Massey . He said that sixty-five per cent of the clientele of the Inter-Continental consists of frequent business travellers , and that they would mean more new business for New York . Then he introduced Leonard Leonard , of Leonard of London , a hairdressing concern , and his wife , Mrs. Leonard . They will have the hairdressing salon in the hotel . Afterward , three people  --  two young women employees of the hotel and a tall man irreproachably dressed  --  had a conversation in a corner near the Vanderbilt Room . For a few minutes , the women discussed the hotel exclusively , and the man , who was not an employee , apparently found it difficult to add anything . His attention seemed to wander to the carpet . Then he looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of Vermont , he was evidently aware of the change but only half aware of the topic . " I have two point three acres in Woodstock , " the woman said . " I bought it at an auction . There 's nothing on it , and I 've only seen it once , from the window of a car , during a blizzard . " " I used to have a place in Woodstock , " the man said . " Across the river from Rhinebeck . " " That 's Woodstock , New York , " said the woman . " I mean Vermont . Woodstock , Vermont . " " Oh , " he said . " I had a place there , too . " Flag VV E went up to the Explorers Club , on East Seventieth Street , the other afternoon to witness the presentation of something called the Flag for Planet Earth to an explorer who was about to set off on an expedition to the Andes . The presentation was to be held in the club 's trophy room , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had arrived early , wt spent some time looking around thr room , which measures about thirty by sixty feet and has a peaked ceiling that rises to about forty feet at its center . A Persian rug covered most of the floor . Flanking a huge fireplace were two elephant tusks . Mounted in front of one of the room 's leaded windows was a four-foot-long rhinoceros horn . At various spots around the room we saw a compass used by Admiral Peary , a model of the first Vanguard satellite , African shields , African drums , a mask from Upper Volta , a bronze bust of a Masai warrior , a number of wild-animal heads , some hunting knives , some antique rifles , and a totem pole . Not Ear from the totem pole , a serious-looking young man in a dinner jacket was sounding deep notes on a copper horn about eight feet long . He turned out to be Dr. Thomas McEvilley , who teaches at Rice University 's Institute for the Arts . We asked him why he was blowing the horn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McEvilley said . " I first heard it in Nepal . It is used ceremonially , and its sound is supposed to represent the void . We thought it would be appropriate for today 's presentation . " He resumed blowing the horn  --  its sound was low , hollow , and somewhat minatory  --  and we approached a young man with shoulder-length THE NEW YORKER gray hair who was wearing a double-breasted black velvet suit and a top hat . Removing his top hat , he told us that he was James Lee Byars , the artist who had designed the flag that was about to be presented . " It 's nineteen feet in diameter , and it 's a perfect circle , because it represents all the directions on earth , " he said . " I 've done a smaller version of the flag , only seven feet in diameter , which I expect will be taken aloft in a satellite and released , to circle in orbit forever . Actually , I regard that one as a planet sign rather than a planet jiag , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand what I mean ? " We said that we thought we did . Then we approached a small table , not far from the fireplace , behind which a dark-haired man was preparing to serve red liquid from a punch bowl and some red bananas from a platter . He told us that his name was Emery Velizquez , and that he worked for a caterer . " They told me that there would be a celebratory theme today , " he said . " I dyed the vodka red , but it took me a half day of shopping to come up with the red bananas . " The presentation ceremony took place at about one-thirty , with some twenty members of the club and their guests in attendance . Mr. Byars , Dr. McEvilley , and a few other people unfolded the earth flag and draped it over some scaffolding . The flag was almost entirely of gold lame . The recipient  --  Dr. Charles F. Brush , an archeologist , who is a former president of the Explorers Club and is now the national chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement accepting the flag , during which he said , " It 's a world flag , it 's a universal flag , it 's the flag of the future . " As people broke into conversational groups , we spoke with Dr. Brush , whose impending departure for the Andes later that afternoon had brought the ceremony about . He is a tall , stur dily built gray-haired man , and he was wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a blue suit with a brass belt buckle shaped like an armadillo . He told us that the co-leader of the expedition would be a surveyor and mountaineer named Peter Bruchhausen , and that the team would include several Argentine scientists , from the Argentine Center for Anthropological Studies . " We 're going to the central portion of the Andes , and we may climb a peak known as Ojos del Salado , " Dr. Brush explained . " Very little exploration has been done in that region . What reports we have on it come almost entirely from climbers , and they have seen what appear to be pre-Columbian ruins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  probably Incas , to use the term rather loosely  --  may have venerated the mountains as sources of water , and thus sources of life . Ojos del Salado is the highest volcano in the world  --  it 's inactive  --  and the area we plan to explore is at twenty-two thousand feet . lAre expect to go in on foot , probably with mules . We have had reports of architecture , ceramic and animal offerings , and mummified remains , and since almost none of the region has been mapped or pho tographed  --  only glimpsed  --  the prospect is very exciting . We 'll be down there about six weeks , and I regard this expedition as a preliminary one , mainly to substantiate the stories we 've heard . I plan to go back several times to do more extensive archeological work . " We asked Dr. Brush whether he was going to take the earth flag along , and he smiled and said , " No , but we 'll take an Explorers Club flag  --  a redwhite-and-blue flag with a compass design in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditions . For that matter , an Explorers Club flag was taken by Apollo XV to the moon . " By this time , about half the red vodka had been consumed . ( The red bananas did n't seem to be going over so well . ) Dr. Brush headed for the door , saying that he had three hours to pack and to catch a plane for Buenos Aires . Mr. Byars continued to walk around the room in his top hat . Dr. McEvilley , who still looked quite serious , continued to blow the Tibetan temple horn , standing next to the golden flag , which now caught a sudden burst of sunlight from an east window and began to give off a dazzling gleam , as if it had been touched with fire
