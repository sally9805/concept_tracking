Robbins meets Gershwin , and both come out winners <P> George Gershwin was the archetypal American composer : a Tin Pan Alley tunesmith with high artistic aspirations . The man who set the country humming Oh , Lady , Be Good and Someone to Watch Over Me also wrote more formally complex , jazz-tinged " crossover " works like Rhapsody in Blue , three Preludes for piano , and most ambitious of all , the Concerto in F for piano and orchestra . <P> In dance , the likely parallel is Choreographer Jerome Robbins , 63 , of the New York City Ballet . Robbins ' popular credentials are impeccable-a string of Broadway hits that includes the dances for On the Town , West Side Story , Gypsy and Fiddler on the Roof . Yet his first love has always been ballet , and during a career stretching back to 1944 , he has created such modern classics as the footloose Fancy Free , the silent Moves and a brilliant gloss on Afternoon of a Faun . Last week at Lincoln Center , in a meeting of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biggest , most problematic instrumental work , unveiling The Gershwin Concerto , based on the Concerto in F. <P> Gershwin was never entirely comfortable in the high-toned world of " serious " art . But Robbins is ; his sense of structure-of how to hold a multimovement piece together-is stronger and surer . Against an art deco backdrop with a huge " G , " Robbins enshrines the soul of Gershwin 's piano in four crisply moving soloists , led by the technically dazzling , ebullient Darci Kistler . He impersonates the orchestra with a corps of 24 dancers-a dozen of each sex-and follows the episodes of the music as if he were charting a graph . Yet , where Gershwin 's music ultimately degenerates into appealing but theoretically unrelated vignettes , Robbins ' dance is unified with a tight vocabulary of motion and movements . It is a kind of visual cross-referencing that constantly reminds the audience that it is watching one work , not three or 30 . <P> At the first orchestral flourish , the corps strikes a series of sassy poses , which melt away at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended first-movement pas de deux , Kistler and Christopher d'Amboise follow the music 's every twist and unexpected turn , illustrating its ripples with flowing figurations of their own . The third movement 's bold , thrusting opening is similarly reflected in the dance , which includes some rapid-fire footwork for D'Amboise inspired by the rat-a-tat-tat of the piano . Paradoxically , Robbins is most , and least , successful with his extended bagatelle in the second movement . Into a vivid world of women - the girls in dark red , Calegari and Kistler in brightest white - Robbins suddenly injects the dark , powerful presence of Mel Tomlinson , effecting a stark , dramatic contrast . He then spoils the mood by having Tomlinson and Calegari dance a lazy , dull pas de deux . <P> The new ballet recalls Robbins ' Interplay ( 1945 ) in its brash colloquialism , and In G Major ( 1975 ) in its formal structure . ( And why not ? Gershwin 's concerto was one of the models for Ravel 's Concerto in G , on which the ballet In G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a pro found work , it is still joyous jazz-age jeu d ' esprit that transcends its source - bringing honor to both George Gershwin and Jerome Robbins . <P> - By Michael Walsh
