 | John Fitzgerald Kennedy always maintained an outward coolness , a detachment . If he was much moved about something , he often left the room rather than show it . It was also true that nobody knew him whole . He revealed only small pieces of himself to different people , always keeping for himself his own core of mystery . He was 28 years old when his father demanded he run for Congress . ' It was like being drafted , " Kennedy told columnist Bob Considine . " My father wanted his eldest son in politics . " Even while campaigning , he always managed time for women . Edward McLaughlin , who later became a lieutenant governor , recalled how Jack left in the middle of a parade in Boston to race for the train because he had a date in New York . In 1947 , that first year in Congress , 300 Washington correspondents voted him " the handsomest member of the House .

But sex to Jack Kennedy was like another cup of coffee or maybe dessert . " His father had established the pattern . Joe Kennedy was known to bring his mistresses home to Hyannis Port , often while his wife , Rose , was there . The elder Kennedy had no qualms about flirting with one of Jack 's women friends and telling her , " Why do n't you get yourself a live one ? " It seemed as if Jack Kennedy spent a good part of his life proving that he was a " live one . " He once confided to columnist Joe Alsop , " I 've got this slow-motion cancer , which they say gets you when you 're about 40 . " That was perhaps an explanation for his frenetic womanizing . He had had surgery on his back after a PT-boat collision in World War II , and the pain never left him . It varied only in intensity . Only his family and close friends knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public sight . It was again Kennedy Senior who persuaded his son to run against Senator Henry Cabot Lodge for his senate seat in 1952 . Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was born on July 28 , 1929 . In 1938 her parents divorced . Her father was the love of Jacqueline 's life . " Drippingly handsome , " he looked amazingly like Clark Gable , and society columnists called him " Jack the Sheik " or " Black Jack . " His was the reputation of a glorious rake who cut a great swath among society 's eligible ? and ineligible ? females . Her mother , who remarried the very wealthy Hugh D. Auchincloss , urged her daughter to marry a man 145  | with money , as she had . Until then she kept Jackie on a tight rein with a small allowance . Jacqueline started college at Vassar , spent a year in France , mostly at the Sorbonne , then transferred to George Washington University in Washington , D.C. For a short time she was engaged to John Husted , Jr. , a Yale man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $17,000 a year , " he said , " and her mother disapproved of our marriage . " They broke up . Jacqueline met Jack Kennedy in the spring of 1951 , when she was still a college student . She was 22. he was 34 . " She took to Jack right away , ' recalled Charles Bartlett , then correspondent for the Chattanooga Times , the man who introduced them . " I leaned over the asparagus  | and asked her for a date , " Kennedy reminisced . Jacqueline smiled at that . " There was no asparagus . " Jacqueline knew of Jack 's playboy reputation and was not daunted . Her father , after all , had a similar history . In many ways Kennedy may have reminded her of her father ? the same ability to generate excitement , the same good looks , the same sense of humor . What bothered her was that she differed so much from the women he seemed to prefer ? seductive and fullbodied . She was highly conscious that her figure was flat . However , she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she herself had . She told a friend that she and Jack were both like icebergs with the greater part of their lives invisible . She felt they both sensed this in each other and that this was a bond between them . Another bond was their wit ? his perhaps more gentle , hers more biting . B y 1952 Kennedy was a senator , and his father painted the brightest picture of political promise , but the elder Kennedy stressed Jack 's need for a wife and family . Jacqueline had all the assets , plus his father 's enthusiastic approval . She catered to Jack 's taste . She preferred French films but happily went with him , on short notice , to some adventure movie . He described her later as a romantic " in the old-fashioned sense of the word . " He was not . There were few signs of open affection . Never flowers or candy . That was not his style . Jacqueline was in Fngland attending her sister Lee 's wedding when Jack finally proposed in a transatlantic phone call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Mary 's Roman Catholic Church in Newport , R.I. Cars hacked up for a half mile at the reception at Hammersmith Farm , home of her mother and stepfather . Hugh D. Auchincloss . The bride and groom spent more than two hours shaking the hands of their twelve hundred guests . " She was another girl crazy about her husband when she got married , " Jack Kennedy 's friend Charles Spalding said of Jacqueline Kennedy . The couple found a house to rent in the elegant Georgetown section of Washington , D.C. Jacqueline made sure her husband got his lunch delivered at his office , returned hooks to the Library of Congress for him , and memorized some of his favorite poems . She loved it when he came home early , but often he worked late or was away campaigning . " Whenever Jackie was lonely , she 'd come over to our house and maybe I 'd take her to a movie , " remembered their friend , magazine editor and artist , Bill Walton , who lived nearby with his children . Jackie 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In their strangulated way , they loved each other , " Betty Spalding said , " but neither was able to relate to the other . He was always quite diffi-dent toward her . " Jack flirted with any pretty girl at a party , as he always had ? even if his wife was there . For a man who was normally very kind and consid// erate of people . he was obviously not conscious of how much he hurt his wife . She knew even then , when he came home late . he was n't always working . Washington was a small town . and there were gossips willing to pass on ugly reports . Throughout their courtship Jack had been on crutches as often as not . The chief source of pain was a disintegrated spinal disk . Within seven months . beginning in October 1954 , he underwent two critical operations , and he almost died both times . " It was the first time I really prayed , " said Jacqueline . She was with him constantly , assisting him in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trying to make him laugh . In this time of pain the young Kennedys found themselves closer than ever . What they shared then was what they liked best in each other ? their intelligence , their wit , @# their saucy irreverence for the world . But when he recovered , they found they still had the same problems . Kennedy always steered dinner conversations to politics , and politics bored Jacqueline into nearly total silence . She hsd tried . She took courses in American history at Georgetown University but they helped little . At parties she often sat by herself , her husband generakly ignoring her . With the growing certainty of Adlai Stevenson 's nomination for president in 1956 the question of the vicepresidential nomination took on a fresh urgency . Kennedy became a much talked-about vice-presidential possihility . By the time of the opening of the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago he was a candidate for the nomination . A photographer took a picture of an excited Jacqueline , then 27 , standing on her scat in the convention box , furiously waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept close to her sister-in-law Eunice Shriver 's apartment in Chicago . She was then pregnant with her first child . " I do n't know if John is going to he nominated for vice-president or not . " she told a reporter . " I 'm very proud of him , no matter what . " On the night of the balloting it was touch and go , but it was Estes Kefauver who finally won the vice-presidential nomination . " Jack did n't say much , " said Senator George Smathers , a long-time Kennedy friend . " He told everybody , ' Look , it 's all over . We did great considering what time we had . I want to thank everybody . ' And then he made some joke . But I knew he was hurt , deeply hurt . " The next morning Kennedy was on his way to Paris and the Riviera . Jacqueline had been at her husband 's bedside all those months when he needed her , and now she needed hint .

Smathers insists that Jacqueline told him . " Jack worked so hard , and I think you all ought to go off and have a good time . " But another friend insisted that Jackie was " hitter " about his leaving . Jack and his friends stopped off in Paris for a night on the town then went to Cannes on the Riviera to rent a sailboat and head for Italy . A Washington Star reporter later interviewed the skipper and cook who reported the presence aboard of ' several young women . Jacqueline went to Hammersmith Farm , her mother 's home in Newport , and a week later miscarried a baby girl . Her brother-in-law Bobby hurried to her side , while the Washington Post headlined a front-page story : SENATOR KENNEDY ON MIIDITICRRANEAN TRIP UNAWARF HIS WIFE HAS LOST BABY . When Kennedy telephoned from Italy . Smathers told him , " You better get back to your wife if you ever want to run for president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return he was away again . This time he was out campaigning for Adlai Stevenson . After his defeat by Eisenhower that fall , Stevenson had said that John Kennedy would he " the one person people will remember from the convention . " It was true . Suddenly John Kennedy 's picture was on the cover of many magazines . But he was no longer thinking about the vice-presidency ? he was considering the presidential nomination . The Kennedys ' marriage was not helped during this time by Jacqueline 's lonely miscarriage . Jack 's frequent absences ? and the continued stories of other women . Kennedy 's friend Smathers admitted . " Jack and I had a nice little place on the river when  | we were both senators , and we 'd go there sometimes with a couple of girls . " Jacqueline told a friend grimly , " I do n't think there are many men who are faithful to their wives . " Those were the days when her frequent moodiness seemed to deepen into depression and intensified her habit of biting her fingernails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as if she had pulled down an invisible shade over her mind . T he man who introduced Jack to Jackie reassessed his role as matchmaker . Said Charles Bartlett , " If I were doing it over , I 'd still push Jack hard to meet Jackie because she was an enormous asset to him . . . but I do n't know how much of an asset he really was to her . He was a lousy husband . He inherited his father 's brains , but he also inherited his love for women . That does n't really go to make a very happy marriage . So if I was doing it over , I do n't know how hard I would push her . " Joe Kennedy told columnist Igor Cassini that he had persuaded Jacqueline not to leave her husband . He felt that a divorce would have been political suicide for his son . " Joe Kennedy told me he had offered Jackie a million dollars not to divorce Jack , " said Cassini . The mood of the marriage changed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and gave birth to Caroline Bouvier Kennedy in November 1957 . They had been married four years . On January 2 , 1960 , John Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency of the United States . He had confided his ambitions to his wife but regarded her as a political minus . The trouble with Jackie , he said , was that she seemed too glamorous , too chic , too Society . " The American people just are n't ready for someone like you , " he once told her and added , " I guess we 'll just have to run you through subliminally in one of those quick flash TV spots so no one will notice . " She burst into tears and ran from the room . Not that she really minded . She hated the idea of shouldering crowds , shaking hands , making speeches . But she was prepared , she said , " to join Jack at a moment 's notice , whenever he wants me . " Kennedy had decided that his wife 's presence in the campaign was necessary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the West Virginia primary . Jacqueline , now pregnant with their second child , made appearances with her husband . Kennedy won the state by a landslide . The first thing he did was call his father in Massachusetts . By the end of May 1960 Kennedy had swept seven primaries , but his oppovents , Lyndon Johnson and Adlai Stevenson , were waiting in the wings at the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles . Kennedy aide Dave Powers had found Kennedy a hideaway apartment only a 10-minute drive from Convention Hall . Jackie , under doctor 's orders , stayed behind in Hyannis Port . On the night of the balloting , in his apartment , Kennedy sat with his tally sheet in his lap . The total number of votes needed for victory was 761 . When Wyoming cast its votes for Kennedy , that put him over the top . " We all jumped up in unison and shouted Hooray ! ' " recalled Kennedy 's secretary , Evelyn Lincoln . " And then he said , That 's fine . Let 's go ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Jackie . ' " Concerned about her previous miscarriages , Jacqueline did some campaigning that fall in her husband 's race against Republican Richard Nixon , but mostly she kept close to home at Hyannis Port with daughter Caroline . Toward the end of the campaign the pressures mounted . Her doctor was telling Jacqueline to do less and less and everyone was asking her to do more and more . " I 'm scared about this baby , " she confided to Joan Braden the National Women 's Chairman for Jack Kennedy . Then came the last two days of the campaign in New York . The state was pivotal . Her husband insisted that her presence was crucial . Her doctor warned her not to do it . " If he lost , " Jacqueline told Braden " I 'd never forgive myself for not being there to help . " She made speeches in Spanish , Italian , and French . Analysts later noted that these minorities in New York had voted in much larger numbers than expected . On election night the Kennedy family gathered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big victory , " Fantastic ! " Kennedy said , and lit up a big black cigar . The mood soon changed . Long past midnight , it was still too close to call . Everything was still up in the air at 3:30 A.M. , and Kennedy announced that he was going to bed . " I woke up at four o'clock when Jack came in , " recalled Jacqueline . who had gone to bed at I I P.M. Her husband told  | that the tide seemed to be turning against them . He was wrong . When he woke at eight the next morning and stuck his head out the window , Kennedy aide Bill Haddad saw him , waved , and gave him a thumbs-up sign . Nixon had not yet conceded but the Secret Service men had arrived . Kennedy had received only 112,803 more votes than Nixon ? the smallest popular vote margin in the century . Jacqueline was not happy when later that month her husband left their Washington home to fly to Palm Beach for a holiday without her , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't travel . Two hours after he left , she began hemorrhaging . She called her doctor , who sent an ambulance for her . En route to Palm Beach , Kennedy was alerted that his wife was hemorrhaging . As soon as the plane landed he rushed out to make a phone call . Chuck Roberts of Newsweek remembered , " He came out as grim as I 've ever seen him and yelled to the pilot , ' Which plane is faster ? ' The pilot pointed to the backup press plane . ' Let 's go ! ' Kennedy said and charged up the ramp of the press plane , followed by a rush of confused reporters . " Midway home Kennedy got the word . " It 's a boy ! " and his wife was fine . The reporters burst into cheers . The president-elect was back in Washington before dawn , bounding up the steps of Georgetown Hospital for a short visit with his wife and a quick look at his son in the incubator . The child was later christened John Fitzgerald Kennedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a kid in a candy store with five dollars . He loved it : the honors , the perks , the power . Jacqueline succeeded , more than most First Ladies , in being as free a spirit as possible inside the White House . She never kept regular hours or any kind of disciplined schedule . The only inviolate hours were those set aside to be with her children and the private time with her husband after lunch . She pushed her son 's carriage around the circular driveway and read regularly to Caroline before dinner . " Let 's go out and kiss the wind , " she would say to her . They went for long walks , picked flowers together . " She spends more time with that child than most mothers I know , " said Bill Walton . Her private time with her husband was every afternoon , after lunch , while the children were napping . She had installed a stereo in the passageway between her room and his , and the music usually played during their private time . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what her afternoon duties were , she left them to be with her husband . If there were visitors , others had to entertain them . Her husband had had his afternoon swim , gone directly to bed . had his lunch in bed off a tray , and waited for her . During their time together the doors were closed and they accepted no phone calls , no interruptions . This was a daily ritual . Although they had their own separate bedrooms , valet George Thomas , who had the morning job of waking the president , would often find his bed empty . Thomas would then tiptoe into Mrs. Kennedy 's bedroom and gently wake the president without waking his wife . During the Eisenhower days , by general agreement , White House dinners were considered formal and dull . Now there was danceable music , skits from plays , poetry readings , ballet , the great musical artists of our country and our time . Conversation was animated , laughter came loud and often , and the museumlike atmosphere of the White House was now transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word . The right wine , the right crystal , the right china . Yet despite all the excitement , the glamour , the White House never meant home to Jacqueline Kennedy . The phrase she used most often to her closest friends was , " It 's like a prison . " Always , there were the poking cameras outside , the gates , the ever-present Secret Service men . Every once in a while she took a short trip on her own to New York . Once she even took off for Palm Beach without informing anyone on the presidential staff . And while she was in Washington she almost always extended her weekends at their Maryland country estate , Glen Ora , to four days . There she could ride her horses and enjoy her children in privacy . Sometimes her husband joined them , sometimes he did n't . With or without his wife , the president seldom lacked company . A regular ritual when he was at his Palm Beach residence was a slow walk down Worth Street with an aide , pointing out particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president , usually at the home of a neighbor or friend . Reporters either saw them going in late at night or coming out in the morning . Such activity was always predicated on the fact that Jacqueline was not with him on that particular trip . " I think he was discreet to an extent , " an intimate said , " and yet I think he wanted people to know he was better with women than his father was . " When the president decided that his wife needed a press secretary , he sent her Pamela Turnure . Pam Turnure had met John Kennedy at the wedding of her friend , Nina Auchincloss , Jacqueline 's stepsister . He was then almost 40 , a senator , and she was barely 20 , a small , fine-boned brunette . At that time she was a receptionist in the Belgian Embassy . Pam went to work for Senator Kennedy as a receptionist . It was during her three years with Kennedy that her landlord insisted that the senator was a frequent visitor at Pam 's apartment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Jack 's women was when she asked me if I knew he was having an affair with Pam Turnure , " Betty Spalding said . " I said I did n't know , and even if I did , I would n't tell her . " An intimate confided that the president privately enjoyed having his mistress work for his wife , " like living life on a high wire . " When Jacqueline kept Pamela busy , the president had other women . Jacqueline knew about some of them . When she took a French photographer on a tour of the White House , she opened an office door and told the photographer in French ; " And this is a young lady who is supposed to be sleeping with my husband . " And then there was Judith Campbell Exner . Campbell claimed that Frank Sinatra introduced her to the president on February 7 , 1960 , in Dean Martin 's hotel suite in Las Vegas . Sinatra , she said , also introduced her to Sam Giancana , the Mafia leader . Besides meeting the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted she also lunched with him in the Oval Office . Seventy phone calls were recorded in the White House log between her and the president . A Senate committee report on the CIA described her as " the president 's friend . " The Campbell affair ended in the spring of 1962 . The strain of the Kennedys ' marriage seemed obvious to close friends and some journalists . " Jackie was a woman full of love and full of hurt , " noted Louisiana congresswoman and family friend Lindy Boggs . " They were two private people , two cocoons married to each other . I think she felt that , since he was so much older than she was , it was up to him to reach more than she did . But I do n't think he could love anyone too deeply . " Reported another confidante , " I  | think Jack and Jackie were both ambivalent about ea ( h other . I think they were both attracted by the image and mystery of wha they thought the other represented . And then , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same things that had caught them . " B y the summer of 1961 Kennedy felt the time had come for frank discussions between himself and Russia 's Premier Nikita Khrushchev and France 's President Charles de Gaulle . The Kennedys ' trip to France in June was a diplomatic deadlock but a personal triumph . Paris was Jacqueline 's triumph especially . Cheering crowds massed everywhere she went . At a gala dinner de Gaulle concentrated so completely on Jacqueline that he ate little dinner . When de Gaulle told the president that Mrs. Kennedy knew more French history than most French women . Kennedy felt proud . The French newspapers headlined the Kennedys LES MAGNIFIQUES . Jacqueline now knew that she was no longer simply a pretty prop for her husband . Her impact was real . " I am the man who came here with Jacqueline Kennedy . " the president told a Paris audience . The Kennedys left France for Vienna , Austria , and a meeting with Khrushchev . If the trip was a diplomatic failure for the president , again it was a triumph for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jack obviously found attractive , but it also made her more vulnerable , " said Charles Spalding . " She has a toughness , like a fighter who does n't go down but gets hurt . I think she probably suffered to beat the band , but nobody ever i aw the hurt . But she filled out the pictw e , for Jack . If you look at pictures of the two of them and take her out of the pie lure and put somebody else in , then you 'll see what I mean . Sometimes I wonder if he knew . " Strangely - Hough , one of her most frequent qui-. ' : ls with her multimillionaire husband concerned money . " I do n't understand it , " Jackie confided to a fri : rid . " Jack will spend any amount of money to buy votes , but he balks at investing a thousand dollars in a beautiful Tainting . He seems more concerned th ! se days with my budget than with the budget of the United States . " " That Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Smathers . " She thinks she can keep on spr nding it forever . She 's driving me cri zy . " Some of her expenses : clothes ? $4.000 : $900 for riding accessories ; and $800 for a vacuum cleaner for her horses . One item read : Department store ? $40,000 . " What does this mean ? " Kennedy asked . " Oh , heck . I do n't remember , " Jackie whispered . " What do you mean , you do n't remember ? " Total personal expenses for the first White House year : $145.446 . " Do you realize I only make $101.000 a year as president ? If we did n't have a private income , we 'd he bankrupt , " Kennedy told his wife . The cynical said that the Kennedy children were part of the political act . It was true that photographers were often around when the Kennedy children came to call on their father in the Oval Office . It made popular copy . But they were not there when Caroline , and later John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. to say good-night . They would be in their pajamas , ready for a romp . Their father would get on the floor with them , and they would be all over him , jumping up and down , pounding him , all of them laughing . He would laugh with them and relax in a way that he did with no one else . Sometimes his son would visit him during the day . Kennedy would hold out his arms and John would run to him for his hug and kisses . Then the father would grin and say , " Tell me a secret . " John would buzz something into his ear and the father would put on an exaggerated look of mock surprise and say , " You . . . do n't . . . tell . . . me ! " And his son would laugh . Caroline made it a ritual to walk her father downstairs to work every morning . She called him " silly Daddy " and he called her " Buttons . " Occasionally she came charging into the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sit in her father 's lap . The father needed no urging to be with his children . With them his love was full , without reservation . I n 1963 Jacqueline Kennedy wa , expecting her third child . Because of her traumatic record of miscarriages . she minimized her activity , spending more time in Hyannis Port . She had been watching her two children taking riding lessons at a barnyard near Hyannis in August 1963 when she felt a sharp pain . A farm employee quickly called her obstetrician while Mrs. Kennedy corralled her children into the family car to head home . The doctor and the helicopter were waiting when she got there . The president had been talking to the Citizens Committee for a Nuclear Ban when he got the news . He called neighbor Larry Newman . " I want you to go over there and wait at the hospital until I get there . " Newman said , " I 'll go right away . " Jacqueline was already in the labor room when Newman got there .

The baby was in a pressurized incubator when a Catholic chaplain baptized him " Patrick Bouvier . " The president had arrived by the time the doctors decided to transfer Patrick to the Children 's Medical Center in Boston . As they wheeled him outside a woman made the sign of the cross . That day of August 8 the president commuted by helicopter from the baby  | to his wife , then back to the baby again in Boston . Said aide Dave Powers " I was with the president at the hospital when he was holding Patrick 's hand and the nurse said , He 's gone . ' And tears came into his eyes . He just cried and cried .

They made a poignant picture , the two of them , hand in hand , walking out of the hospital . The strain was still in her face , and she hesitated at the steps . " Careful , " the president murmured , guiding her into the car . They were going to Brambletyde , their rented house on Squaw Island in Hyannis . Their two children were waiting for them . Jack Kennedy had invited their @# friend Bill Walton to spend that weekend with them . " Jack and Jackie were very close after Patrick 's death , " said Walton . " She hung on to him and he held her in his arms ? something nobody ever saw at any other time because they were very private people . " " Jack never said so , " Jacqueline said , talking about the loss of Patrick , " but I know he wanted another boy . He was the kind of man who should have had a brood of children .

" Lee had been summering with Aristotle Onassis , the multimillionaire Greek tycoon .

' " Kennedy turned to his wife , " You see , Jackie , you really are important to me . " Beaming , Jacqueline said , " I 'm looking forward to the ' 64 campaign . " It was almost midnight on November 21 , 1963 , when they checked into their Fort Worth hotel . A special mattress for the President 's bad back had been flown in from the White House . The bed was a king-size . That night the First Lady decided to sleep in a small separate Bedroom in their suite . Dallas was timed for noon the next day .

" Just then , the door of the plane opened , and the two of them walked down the steps into history .. . Jacqueline Kennedy stayed in the operating room while the doctors worked to save her husband 's life . She was still there when they put the white sheet over his body , and she slipped her wedding ring on his finger . On Air Force One returning to Washington , she sat next to his casket . She was talking , a jumble of scattered memories . " To think I very nearly did n't go , " she said . " Oh , what if I 'd been out riding somewhere . Thank God I went with him .

As the world watched the funeral on television she knelt before the catafalque and kissed the flag . Then the world cried as her three-year-old son saluted his father and the American flag . " I just hope I helped him , " Jacqueline Kennedy repeated to friends . For more than a year she was in a very deep depression . Her life was very disorganized and she was always breaking appointments . Family friend James Reed remembered being with her some four months after the assassination . " and Jackie Kennedy suddenly fell sobbing on my shoulder and could n't stop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Kennedy , even his womanizing . " There 'll never he another Jack , " she reminisced to Joan Braden . But she said she now understood so well why he lived every day of his life so intensely . " And I 'm glad he did .
