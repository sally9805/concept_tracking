For Lebanon 's civilians , death and suffering are the victors <P> Hundreds of Palestinian refugees sat disconsolately under makeshift tents in the dusty , grubby Beirut park that goes by the absurdly fancy name of Garden of the Arts . Among them was Nefalah Farour , 38 , who had fled the P.L.O.-dominated port of Tyre on the first day of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon . Accompanied by five of her seven children , she had walked through the mountains to the dubious safety of Beirut . Exhausted , she squatted on a flattened cardboard box and fretted over the fate of the two youngsters she had been obliged to leave behind in her flight from the Israeli shelling . The two children had been playing at a neighbor 's house when the family ran . Had they survived ? The answer remained buried in the rubble of Tyre . <P> Such scenes of human displacement and despair had become appallingly commonplace in Lebanon in the aftermath of the Israeli blitz .

Wurmstedt and Reporter Leroy Aarons .

Others fled to the countryside or the capital . Trekking back after the ceasefire , many found their homes severely damaged or destroyed . Still uncounted dead were hidden under the shattered masonry of their buildings and shops . An incalculable number of wounded lay in makeshift hospitals . <P> Estimates of the total number of dead , injured and homeless varied wildly . United Nations Secretary-General Javier Prez de Cullar said that 1.5 million people-half the population of the country-had been affected by the fighting . According to Lebanese sources , about 10,000 were killed and 16,000 wounded . The State Department 's Agency for International Development said that about 600,000 people from Beirut and southern Lebanon had been " directly affected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross , which is distributing medical supplies in Lebanon , called these estimates " much exaggerated . " By Red Cross reckoning , about 300,000 civilian refugees had been displaced in southern Lebanon , the majority eventually returning to their homes in Israeli-occupied territory . Whatever the exact figures , the toll in human suffering was shockingly high .
