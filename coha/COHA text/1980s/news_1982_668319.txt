For seven days now , embarrassment and shame have been my constant companions . I have worn them like a veil of tears and both emotions have chased me , haunting me around town , dogging my every step , ruining nearly every conversation . It began a week ago last evening with a phone call from my friend , Crane the treasurer . His voice was full with glee and anticipation . " I just heard on the news that the governor is suing you and The Globe , " he said . " Is this part of his crime bill ? " I asked . " No , " Crane answered . " I ' m serious . He ' s going to file suit against TheGlobe , an editorial cartoonist and two columnists . You have to be one of them . " " Absolutely , " I told him . I was wondering whether or not Eddie King would give me a chance to plea bargain when the phone rang again . Craven the policeman was now telling me the same story . Fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . Fine , I thought . In suing me , the governor would have to take his place in line behind an oil company , a credit card conglomerate and a department store . Over the past 24 months , I have mentioned Eddie King several times in the public prints . I have pointed out that his favorite reading is a take-out menufrom Anthony ' s Pier 4 . Last Sept. 14 , I put in the paper that he was " the big Space Cadet in the corner office . " On Sept. 7 , lacking anything of substance to write , I said that " Eddie King epitomizes what happens when you teach an accountant how to read . " Early in the summer , I put down that he was " a cipher , " that if he " didn ' t have weights in his shoes , he ' d have to be tied down like the Hindenburg " and that if he " ever debates Mt . Wachusett , my money is on the mountain . " Last Monday morning , as I considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , my mother called . I began to explain that I had no time for small talk , that I was in the middle of preparing a case that would have made Darrow spit with envy . " You should go sell shoes for a living , " my mother said . " I ' m too busy to fight today , " I answered . " I ' m being sued by the governor . " " No , you ' re not , " she said . " That ' s why I ' m calling . I think I ' m the only one who reads anything you write . " " How old are you , really ? " I asked . " Old enough to still be able to read and what I read this morning is that you ' re a nobody , " my mother said . " You can ' t even get mentioned in a suit by the governor . He ' s suing The Globe and three unknowns named Szep , Farrell and Turner . What does that make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Eddie King chose not to sue me , I began to consider other career opportunities . I knew if I found employment in the high- tech industry or the aluminum siding business , or if I went roofing houses with Clifford in South Boston , that I would not be victimized by this kind of humiliation . By Thursday , rage and anger had taken over . And today , because I now take King ' s actions personal , I put him on notice here in The Globe newspaper that I am in the middle of a big legal action against him . I have already spoken with counsel . His name is Richard N. Goodwin . He is in the book . He graduated first in his class at the famous Harvard Law School , clerked for Frankfurter , who was on the Supreme Court , worked for two Presidents of the United States and now handles me . Goodwin has already instructed me not to speak with King because the whole matter will soon be in the hands of the courts . " You mean I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come in governor ? " I asked . " No communication whatsoever , " Goodwin told me . " Our case is obvious . It ' s very clear : the governor , in not filing suit against you , has held you up to ridicule among your peers . He has made you an object of public scorn . " " Get to the important part , " I asked . " The damages , " Goodwin said right away like a real lawyer . " Well , the damages will be commensurate with the worth of your reputation . " " I thought you said we ' d sue for money ? " I said . " I said , we ' d try , " Goodwin told me . " But there ' s a problem . I notice , in addition to everything else , you also once wrote that you always get the impression Eddie King would lose a debate with a dumbwaiter . ' Well , it ' s possible you weren ' t sued because they don ' t want to challenge something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
