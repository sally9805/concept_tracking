So Foreign Minister Roelof ( " Pik " ) Botha should hardly have been surprised when the Foreign Correspondents Association 's annual banquet last week turned into an angry slanging match . Botha gave as good as he got . <P> " I am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work instead of all the beauty , promise and goodwill , " Botha said .
