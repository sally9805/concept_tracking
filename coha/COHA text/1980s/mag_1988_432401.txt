 | Give him a goatee or spectacles , a toga or banker 's stripes , and John Cleese can play practically anyone . As one-sixth of the wickedly irreverent Monty Python troupe , he assumed all kinds of roles . He was the pompous , high-kicking Minister of Silly Walks . He was the stern but stupid Roman soldier who made the hero of " The Life of Brian " scrawl his anti-Roman graffiti 100 times because the Latin was n't grammatical . As the sour hotel keeper Basil Fawlty in the TV series " Fawlty Towers , " he was deliciously officious and inept . But let 's be realistic ? how could a rubber-faced guy , with a voice that can swoop from a whining squeal to basso profundo , possibly play a romantic hero ? How could a gawky Brit with a Mount Rushmore forehead and jutting chin ever wind up getting the girl ? In the sleeper hit " A Fish Called Wanda , " Cleese does just that . As the writer , executive producer and star , this is Cleese 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans may be stunned to discover that he 's given the most outrageous , juicy comic bits to his costars , Kevin Kline and fellow Python Michael Palin , while he plays a mild-mannered , henpecked British barrister who 's seduced by Wanda , a sexy American played by Jamie Lee Curtis . Just to push this male midlife fantasy a little further , he 's called his character Archie Leach ? Cary Grant 's real name . " A Fish Called Wanda " is a weird kettle of you-know-what , and Cleese 's unlikely casting of himself is a triumph . After years of creating wacky caricatures , Cleese gives a funny , touching performance that 's more than skin deep . The comedy banks heavily on AngloAmerican cultural clashes , and Cleese uses Archie to send up the stereotypical British twit . " Do you have any idea what it 's like to be English ? " Archie asks Wanda in a serious moment . " We 're all terrified of embarrassment . That 's why we 're all dead . All my friends are dead ? we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , has been skewering the quintessential Brit ? headmasters , bank managers , Army officers ? since his Python days . " Archie is characteristic of the English middle class , " he explained in a recent interview , @# @# @# tossing one long leg ? he is 6 feet 5 ? over the arm of his chair . " Our men have a tendency to be slightly wimpish and ineffectual . " When Cleese had trouble making Archie come alive in the script , he says , " I drastically rewrote the part , making it more real , simply using quite a lot of stuff from my own life and my own attitudes about being British . " Getting soft : If Archie seems too serious for the biting wit of vintage Python , well , Cleese admits he may be getting soft . At 48 , he is n't especially wacky or cynical . He 's a nice English gentleman ? charming , low key , a tad earnest . " I think my comedy is a lot more interesting and varied than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel much freer to play a straight , more romantic role in Wanda . ' I could n't have put that vulnerability on the screen a few years ago ? I thought it was unacceptable . " Cleese 's change of heart has n't come only with maturity . He 's spent more than three years in group therapy and is now involved in Buddhist thought and the philosophy of Gurdjieff , the 20th-century teacher of self-enlightenment . " It has made me realize how much emotions and attitudes that are fundamentally negative are valued in our culture , " he explains soberly . " I 'm beginning to prize things like a generosity of spirit . " Born near Bristol , England ? Cary Grant 's hometown , Cleese notes ? he was the son of an insurance salesman whose name was originally Reginald Cheese . ( His father changed it to Cleese when he enlisted for World War I. ) Cleese read law at Cambridge , where he joined the famous  | Cambridge Footlights Revue and met Graham Chapman . Later , after brief stints writing for NEWSWEEK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " The Frost Report . " Working in British broadcasting around that time were Chapman , Eric Idle , Michael Palin , Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam . In 1969 the six writer / performers teamed up to create " Monty Python 's Flying Circus " for television . They went on to make the successful movie " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " in 1974 , which was followed by " The Life of Brian " ( 1979 ) and " Monty Python and the Meaning of Life " 1983 ) . The last , says Cleese , " is a dog 's breakfast with about six great things in it and a lot of stuff that 's not up to scratch . " All the same , is there any hope that Monty Python will be reunited ? " Not as a group , " maintains Cleese. 70 films : Since 1971 Cleese has used his wit as a writer and actor to enliven a series of management-training movies . The 70 films he 's made have been a big success with British and American businesses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $16 million . He and his former psychiatrist , Robin Skynner , cowrote a book called " Families and How to Survive Them " and are at work on a sequel on organizations . Cleese also has been busy as a pitchman for such companies as American Express and Callard &; Bowser candy . After " Wanda " he may have less time for moonlighting . The comedy follows a gang of diamond thieves in London who start double-crossing each other the minute the robbery is over . While the smarmy ringleader , George ( Tom Georgeson ) , waits to be sprung from jail , his girlfriend , Wanda Curtis ) , and her dim secret lover , Otto Kline ) , try to find where George has stashed the jewels . Wanda woos - Archie , George 's lawyer , to learn the hiding place . Meanwhile , Ken ( Palm ) , George 's loyal , stuttering sidekick , is hilarious as he valiantly attempts to rub out the old lady who 's the prosecution 's star witness . The movie owes its madcap streak to the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director Charles Crichton , 77 , made such classic films as " The Lavender Hill Mob . " Fervent Monty Python followers may find " Wanda " tame , though it veers , in true Python style , from smart Oxbridge satire to such lowly sight gags as Archie trimming his toenails . Its blackest , dumbest and grossest moments are clearly indebted to Cleese 's tenure with the troupe ? a Yorkshire terrier hit by a car is flattened like a bearskin rug ; a starknaked Archie is surprised in his love nest by a family of strangers who 've taken over the lease ; Otto tortures Ken by shoving French fries ? with just a touch of ketchup ? up his nose . The styles in this hybrid occasionally jar ? Kline , for example , can be so mannered as the manic Otto that he seems to have dashed in from another movie . But if at moments " A Fish Called Wanda " seems to be swimming upstream , it 's still well worth the plunge . With " Wanda " behind him , Cleese is planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago from Bryan Ferry . Recently separated from his second wife , he has two children ? Camilla , four , and Cynthia Caylor , 17 , who plays his teenage daughter in " Wanda . " He may begin to toy with a plot for a new movie with the " Wanda " cast . " I loved the permutations and combinations of the four of us , " he says . " And it was a very happy experience making the film . " But the next movie wo n't be a sequel . " It would be something completely different , maybe with Kevin getting the girl , and me being the villain . Something like a Hitchcock . " He muses a moment and draws on his after-lunch Silk Cut cigarette . " If you have a really great thriller and add comedy to it , you have a very combustible mixture . " @#
