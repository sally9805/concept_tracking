CANCER PREVENTION STRATEGY fIT THE NCI A tough , no-nonsense , prevention-minded workaholic at the helm of the NCI teaches the cancer-causing dangers of cigarettes with a vengeance . by Cory SerVaas , M.D. Dr. Sam Broder has a well-earned reputation for being brusque , brilliant , and all business . The new director of the National Cancer Institute comes by his toughness naturally . Born in 1945 , he survived the waning days of World War II by hiding with his parents and his sister in the rural countryside near his native Lodz , Poland . Part of his first four years was spent in a displaced persons camp before the family immigrated to the United States and a working-class neighborhood in Detroit . Always an outstanding student , Broder attended the University of Michigan on scholarship and graduated cum laude from its medical school . Since joining the National Cancer Institute 17 years ago , Broder has served in a variety of posts . He is best known for his recent work in introducing the drug AZT for treating AIDS . He was named by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in December 1988 . In this , the first of a twopart series , he explains to the SatEvePost his priorities as leader of the largest arm of the National Institutes of Health . Dr. SerVaas : Dr. Broder , we were happy to read about your emphasis on prevention at the NCI . What are the prevention goals you 've set for the Institute ? Dr. Broder : In a certain context prevention is the most important priority of the Cancer Institute . There are a number of things that we will try . One of them relates to smoking prevention . I think not many people in this countryknow that lung cancer , which is one of the many diseases caused by smoking , was an exceptionally rare disease at the turn of the century . For example , as a vignette that I might share with you , in 1919 an entire class of medical students at Barnes Hospital St. Louisl was summoned to the autopsy room to see a postmortem examination on a man who had died of lung cancer . They were summoned because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime . So lung cancer was a rather rare disease in this country at one time , and I think it 's possible for it to become a rare disease again . The principle of smoking prevention and the importance of ensuring that all groups in society understand the risks of smoking is really going to be an important feature in what we try to do . We have to make sure that adolescents understand the consequences . We have to make sure that women understand the issues , because smoking and lung cancer , in my opinion , are women 's health issues . We project that more women will die of lungcancer-related deaths than of breast cancer this year . These are important issues , and we need to address them , and we need to take appropriate steps , which we are doing . Dr. S : Specifically , what 's your antismoking agenda ? Dr. B : We 're going to enhance a number of education and outreach activities . We 're going to try to make sure that our office of cancer communication provides relevant information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop projects that test the effectiveness of various smoking-prevention strategies in individuals . The National Cancer Advisory Board , which . is an advisory board to us , recently issued a set of very strong recommendations that it wants to pursue for smoking prevention . That 's one component of our prevention strategy . There are other components , however . I think that we need to talk about diet as a consideration . We know that certain dietary components may play a role in certain cancers . Various immigration studies show that sometimes individuals will move from a region with a low risk of certain types of cancer , and when they begin eating a diet common in our society , they begin to acquire the cancers that we get . Colon cancer is a good example . I think we have to be careful in terms of fat content in the diet and in terms of overall calorie intake . People should try to maintain their appropriate weight , and so on . These are issues that we 'll try to work on . In addition , we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention to a greater extent than we already have . We want deliberately and specifically to do investigator-initiated research on the various micronutrients , such as vitamin C and selenium and beta carotene and so on . These are important issues . We have clinical trials to test the addition of certain micronutrients to the diet . Dr. S : Do you have micronutrient research going on now ? Dr. B : Yes , beta carotene , for example , is an interesting one . And we would hope that eventually we 'll have enough data to not only suggest what people should try to avoid , but what they should try to take . I think that that is a very productive thing . We 've learned in the last few years about a number of nutrients that may have certain protective values . For example , very recently we learned that certain vegetables in the allium family , of which garlic and onions and shallots are representatives , may have a role in protecting against stomach cancer . Now these are research projects , but we hope that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with more specific recommendations . We will continue to emphasize certain types of early-detection technologies . Mammography , for example , we think is extremely important , and we would encourage women over the age of 50 to avail themselves of mammography and consultation with their physicians . Dr. S : What about women over 40 ? I believe that Dr. Myron Moskowitz of the University of Cincinnati recommends that all women over 40 should be mammogramed yearly . Dr. B : I think these are points that can be discussed . NCI recommends that beginning at age 40 , a mammogram should be encouraged every one to two years until the age of 50 , afterwhich it should become annual . Today many women who might benefit from mammography never get it . I do fear there are so many times we make " the perfect the enemy of the good , " and we end up with discussions about whether something is absolutely perfect or absolutely certain when we 're way off the mark . Even in areas where there 's a lot of consensus , we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good but still Dr. Broder , for whom learning comes easy , pointed out that the American educational system does not teach students words of Greek origin . He is surprised when reporters who interview him do n't know what chimera means . shooting for perfection . I think that perfection can be a source of paralysis for all of us . Urn paraphrasing Winston Churchill , of course , but I think that those are realistic goals . Early diagnosis is important . We 're trying to learn more sophisticated techniques and conduct experimental tests for early diagnosis . We hope eventually to test whether the urine can help us detect bladder cancer with more effectiveness . And as we learn these experimental techniques , we have to remember certain very straightforward but exceedingly effective techniques , such as the Pap smear , which I think is extremely important to help us manage cervical cancer . Now as a practical matter , cervical cancer  --  I 'm going back and forth between high technology and low technology  --  causes many entirely preventable deaths , and we need to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to make people act . The Cancer Institute is a scholarly institution . It is a knowledge-disseminating institution , and I think many times we have discussions that do n't take that into account . We are not a regulatory agency . That is not our job , has never been our job , and should n't be our job . Our job is to generate knowledge and encourage people to avail themselves of our knowledge . We will continue early diagnostic activities , and then we will continue new research and treatments which I think will be focused , for example , on adjuvant treatments for breast cancer and colon cancer . 1 think we will see in the next few years exciting results . Now the principle of adjuvant treatment means that you intervene with therapy right after surgery or about the same time as surgery , and the goal is to try to treat tumors at a time when they are microscopic and not detectable any other way . And we feel that , instead of waiting for a woman to have a recurrence of breast cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities for treating women when they have their initial tumors removed . The same thing applies to colon cancer . There are some subsets of individuals who have operations for colon cancer who are at high risk , even up to 50 percent risk , of having a recurrence . And in those individuals we would hope that we can develop knowledge . I feel confident in predicting to you that we will have knowledge The Tragedy of Teenage Smoking When Sylvia Emerson was 17 , she lit her first cigarette and promptly became sick . But she was determined  --  smoking was a sure sign of sophistication in the late ' 50s  --  and before long the pretty blonde cheerleader could count herself among the " in crowd " at Brockport High School , in Brockport , Illinois . " Almost everyone smoked at the time , " recalls Sylvia , now an administrative secretary at Indiana National Bank in Indianapolis . " I guess I thought it would make me feel more important . I got used to it . Then I got addicted and could n't stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how this sign of sophistication could become a habit , and how the habit could become an addiction . Like so many people her age , Sylvia was hooked on tobacco by the time she realized its dangers . She averaged three packs of cigarettes a day , and frightening symptoms could n't persuade her to quit . Even a diagnosis of a spot on her lung in December 1984 did n't deter her . She smoked the night before she entered the hospital . The spot proved to be cancer . " I ca n't begin to tell you how sick I was , " she says . For three months I could do nothing for myself . It was devastating . I never smoked a cigarette after that . " Today , she considers herself to be one of the lucky ones . Four years after the surgery to remove her malignancy , she says there has been no recurrence : " 1 have chosen to believe I 'm fine , that the doctors got it all . My attitude is that there is nothing wrong with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't indulge in " what if " games ? what if she had never smoked ; what if she had kicked the habit a few years earlier . Still , she is bothered by teenagers who refuse to heed the warnings that she never received in her youth . " 1 always try to talk them into stopping . I tell them if they do n't smoke , they should n't start . If they do smoke , they should quit . People think it wo n't happen to them . But it does . 1 use myself as an example . " that will allow us to intervene in certain categories of colon cancer and begin therapy to stop recurrences and delay recurrences and possibly increase our ability to cure , in the true sense of that word , many , many more people . So those are our activities , and I 'm giving you a broad waterfront approach . Having given you all those priorities , the single most important priority will still remain basic research : the funding of investigator-initiated research always has been and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saved that for last , but I think that it was primarily because we 're so used to it that sometimes it goes without saying . But I think that the fundamental aspect of all of our efforts is to support the creative intellect of men and women working on their own projects . We do that by funding grants at multiple institutions throughout the country . But we ca n't allow our commitment to basic research , strong as it is , deter us from applying certain things in a very targeted and specific way . We feel that smoking is a women 's issue . A very specific women 's issue . Just like breast cancer is a women 's issue . There are health-related issues to smoking , and that 's why I stress the point that in this year we expect more women to die from lung cancer than from breast cancer . So it 's a health issue for women , and when people say , " Well , when we talk to women 's magazines , they 're afraid to do an article on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " somebody has to know about that . Dr. S : We 've crusaded against smoking so long in the Post that only 6 percent of Post readers who answered our survey still smoke . Dr. B : In that case you should sleep real easy at night . Dr. S : What about " Pap smears " of the lung ? There 's Dr. Geno Saccamono in Grand Junction , Colorado , working with uranium miners and heavy smokers . He is discovering early lung cancer with Pap smear-like staining of cells . Dr. B : This is an important area of research . We 're also developing our own research in which we try to develop monoclonal antibodies that can pick up certain types of tumor markers that are present only when a tumor cell is present . And that one can take a special sputum sample or biopsy and stain the monoclonal antibody and potentially identify individuals who have a very incipient form of lung cancer before it 's visible on X-ray . So we are doing research on that . It 's still experimental . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after somebody has smoked . We 're trying to learn what causes lung cancer in general . Dr. S : What about radon ? Dr. B : Radon is certainly a risk factor for lung cancer . Dr. S : Do you have your home tested for radon ? Dr. B : Sure . But what 's interesting about smoking is that in situations where another thing is very important ? for example asbestos or radon  --  introduce smoking and you make things even worse . So getting back to the issue about the so-called Pap smears of the lung , yes , that 's part of our research activities in early diagnosis . I consider it research , but we hope that we will be able to develop a comparatively straightforward test , which will have to be more complicated than the Pap smear for cervical cancer , because that 's a comparatively straightforward test . It is very suitable for any doctor 's office . This Pap smear of the lung idea that you 're developing is slightly more complicated . Dr. S : How soon will such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. B : Well , in order to develop something , you have to validate the test , and so I do n't want to give you " this year " or " next year . " Dr. S : Is there a genetic tendency in lung cancer , like low alpha-one antitrypsin in emphysema ? Does it occur in certain families ? Dr. B : Well , let me respond to that . As a result of our basic research activities , we know a lot about what are called oncogenes . And we also know a lot about what are called suppressor genes , and we now know that certain // genes are designed to prevent a malignancy from happening . By the same token , when they 're deleted or mutated they may not put on the brakes and may not be able to do their job . This gives us the idea that it 's a multi-hit phenomenon . You may receive , for example , one hit . A genetic hit as it were , as part of your genetic constitution , but then certain other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  may come into play and give you a second or third hit , which then can lead to the lung cancer state . This is a working theory , but it 's one in which there 's a great deal of experimental data . We 're hoping eventually to have ways to identify individuals who have already sustained damage to their oncogene system or to their suppressor-genes system . In those individuals , if we could identify them , we would ask for an intensive counseling about things like smoking , and perhaps a focus for special high-grade interventions  --  maybe bronchoscopies , where you 're looking for early lesions every year or so , which is something you could n't recommend to the general public at large . But if you had a very specific population , you could say , O.K. , we ca n't do this to the general population yet , but we can help this high-risk group . I 'm talking about things that are not science fiction ; I think that 's something that is possible . Dr. S : Are there other places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy smokers ? Dr. B : He 's not doing the genetic part of it , which still needs research . Dr. S : That 's done at the NCI . Dr. B : Yes . We have a very strong program where we are looking at the molecular basis for lung cancer . There are a lot of facts that we do n't know about lung cancer . Dr. S : Like colon cancer , is lung cancer hereditary ? Dr. 13 : Many cancers have a hereditary component . Dr. S : Lung cancer is n't quite the same as colon cancer ? Dr. II : It 's a special case because lung cancer , in this country at least , has such an overwhelming smoking component . And as far as I know , I 've never seen a baby born with a cigarette in its mouth , so the hereditary component for that is a lot more difficult to define . But I 'm sure there is ; I would be very surprised if there is not some hereditary component to many cancers , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is implicated in many forms of lung cancer . The old theory that smoking was only implicated in squamous-cell lung cancer is incorrect . For example , there is a kind of small-cell lung cancer which is becoming much more common that clearly is linked to smoking , and yet I think that it is true that there are some forms of lung cancer which seem to have a continued on page 106 Cancer Prevention continued from page 54 weaker linkage to smoking than others . But I think that the overwhelming predominance of lung-cancer cases that we have in this country are linked etiologically to smoking . Dr. S : I think it was the EPA that suggested we might prevent " 15,000 to 18,000 cases of lung cancer a year if we could control radon levels . Dr. B : You might . The other advice we would give to somebody living in a radon zone is not to smoke . Dr. S : What about the monoclonal antibodies that you mentioned for cancer therapy ? Dr. B : I think that monoclonal antibodies , genetically engineered antibodies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis and therapy for the future  --  both alone and also as linkage molecules to either certain types of toxins or to certain types of radioactive substances . So you can depend on the concept that they will be important parts of medicine , either diagnostically or therapeutically . And I think that they are an interesting innovation , and what many people may not be aware of is that these tools of genetic engineering allow new generations of antibodies created by taking something from one antibody , a certain region or binding domain , and genetically engineer it to be attached to another kind of backbone . So you have a molecule that essentially is genetically engineered and stitches together two different disparate kinds of activities so we have chimeric molecules . Many words in medicine have Greek roots . The " chimera " was a mythological monster with parts of several animals : a lion 's head , a goat 's body , etc . We 've done similar creative designing in our genetic engineering . But anyway , the point I 'm raising is that we have chimeric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may link it to a human " backbone " and create chimeric molecules . For example , in AIDS , where we took the CD4 receptor which binds to the virus and engineered it so that it 's on a human immunoglobulin backbone , we created the genetically engineered neutralizing antibody . That kind of technology is going to become more and more common , and what I call designer antibodies are going to be more and more common . People will be able to create and synthesize antibodies using the tools of genetic engineering that allow a mixing and matching much as one might put on a wardrobe . ? ? We asked Dr. Broder to expand on his earlier remarks about breast cancer . He suggested that at some time in the future it might be time to do double-blind studies to determine whether an estrogen blocker might prevent some high-risk women from developing breast cancer . ( Women who have two relatives with breast cancer are considered to be at high risk . ) In the July/Aug. issue we will discuss this in Part II of our interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued from page 16 the dugout to home plate , using a bat as a cane . His wife said he cried that night and most of the next day . Ten days later Ruth was admitted to Memorial Hospital . He asked why he had been taken to a cancer hospital , and doctors convinced him that other patients were treated there as well . On July 21 , Ruth was so ill that a priest administered the last rites . But five days later he showed up at the premiere of a movie , The Babe Ruth Story . He was supported on both arms and was so weak that he had to leave halfway through the film . On August 12 the story of Ruth 's
