In Southern California , where sex appeal counts double , UCLA 's offense in recent seasons has had all the allure of Phyllis Diller in a housedress . And to make matters worse , crosstown-rival Southern Cal has continued to come on like Morgan Fairchild in a bikini . While USC 's attack has set hearts throbbing and Heismans and Hertz commercials pouring in , UCLA 's offense could only be described as plain Jane , and that has served to make the Bruins No. 2 in L.A. , not to mention an also-ran in the War of the Roses . Only once since 1966 has UCLA been the Pac-10 's representative in Pasadena on New Year 's Day , while the Trojans have been there 10 times in that span . // But this season the Bruin offense , behind the right arm of senior Quarterback Tom Ramsey , has become a real turn-on  --  so much so that UCLA could permanently alter its image as a dowdy stay-at-home . " Naturally I 'd take an Earl Campbell-type back who could pound into the line 30 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruin Coach Terry Donahue , " but barring that , I 'd like to continue along the same lines we 're moving . I 'd like to think our offense has made a permanent move in this direction . " // That direction is upward , literally and figuratively . In Donahue 's first six years as coach ( 1976-81 ) , UCLA averaged 16.8 passes and 119.7 yards a game through the air . After last Saturday 's 34-6 win over Colorado at Boulder , which ran the Bruins ' record to 4-0 , those per-game stats for ' 82 stood at 33 attempts and 308.8 yards , third best in the nation . By completing 16 of 24 passes for 280 yards against the Buffaloes , Ramsey became tops in the country in pass efficiency . All of which has helped mightily in getting the Bruins a No. 12 ranking in this week 's SI Top 20. // Donahue disputes the idea that UCLA sprouted wings overnight . He argues that his teams have always been " pass efficient "  --  and , true , the Bruins ranked third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a result of Ramsey 's throwing only 19 passes per game for 149.4 yards . If " efficient " was the right word for the UCLA passing attack in 1981 , " sensational " is the correct one this season . // Whether the new direction will produce Donahue 's first Pac-10 title is still a matter of conjecture ; the Bruins face such formidable roadblocks on the way to Pasadena as Washington and Southern Cal , ranked No. 2 and No. 15 , respectively by SI this week . But there 's never been a more appropriate season for UCLA to make it to the Rose Bowl game , because now the bowl is the Bruins ' home field , after 52 years at the Los Angeles Coliseum , a site shared with USC. // A new home , a new offense and now an unblemished record  --  which includes a 41-10 rout of Long Beach State in the Rose Bowl opener on Sept. 11 and three straight victories on the road , over Wisconsin ( 51-26 ) , Michigan ( 31-27 ) and Colorado  --  bespeak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tempering his optimism . Sizzling starts are nothing new for him at UCLA . Ominously , neither are floundering finishes . In Donahue 's first year the Bruins racked up nine wins and a tie before USC beat them 24-14 in the regular-season finale . Result : The Trojans went to the Rose Bowl and defeated Michigan 14-6 , and UCLA went to the Liberty Bowl where it was humiliated 36-6 by Alabama . In 1980 the Bruins won their first six games before losing on consecutive weekends to Arizona and Oregon . Though UCLA rebounded to beat USC 20-17 that season , it was the Trojans who went to the Rose Bowl . // Unnoticed while the aerial offense has gotten publicity is the fact that the Bruin defense has been more solid , if less spectacular , than it was last year . Then UCLA played a slashing , go-to-the-gap defense that too often made the Bruins vulnerable to the run . Against Michigan in the Bluebonnet Bowl , UCLA gave up 320 yards rushing in a 33-14 defeat . But when Defensive Coordinator Jed Hughes left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom Hayes and Bob Field , installed a read-and-react mode for the line . " I like it , " says Irv Eatman , an honorable mention All-America tackle last season . " I think it 's given us more flexibility , a better way of adjusting to different schemes . " // " I do n't like it as much , " says Noseguard Karl Morgan . " Now I have to stay in there and take guys on . I felt my speed gave me the edge the old way . " But no one is complaining about the way Morgan has been playing . Though Eatman has gotten more ink  --  because of his name , his outgoing personality and his performance on national television two years ago when he sacked Ohio State Quarterback Art Schlichter four times  --  Donahue considers Morgan the heart of his defense . // Still , the offense is at the heart of the Bruins ' rejuvenation , which was particularly evident in the Michigan win . In that game UCLA overcame an early 21-0 deficit as Ramsey passed for 311 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of Ramsey . " It was the best game by a quarterback against us in a longtime . " // The victory at Michigan has left a lot of Angelenos thinking that UCLA 's shift to the Rose Bowl was a portentous one . Since 1929 the Bruins had played their home games in the Coliseum , just a stroll across Exposition Boulevard from the Southern Cal campus . But when Al Davis and the NFL Raiders barged in as Coliseum co-tenants , UCLA officials decided they did n't much like the neighborhood and moved out . " Sometimes I felt that we were dealing with Mr. Davis and not the Coliseum Commission , " says UCLA Athletic Director Robert Fischer . " There 's no doubt that with the Raiders and USC also in the Coliseum , we would 've been No. 3. " // Though the Rose Bowl in Pasadena is actually about 10 miles farther from the UCLA campus than the Coliseum ( 24 vs. 14 miles ) , Donahue has played up the " home team " angle . " It 's the beginning of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I thought it was the ideal time to take on a new identity for ourselves . " // That may be true , but what made the Bruins ' transformation to a passing team possible was that Donahue finally had the people he needed to make it work . Foremost among those players is Ramsey , a 6-foot , 185-pound senior . UCLA Offensive Coordinator Homer Smith describes Ramsey 's importance to the Bruins ' attack this way : " The coaches here have n't had nearly as much effect on the offense as Tom Ramsey 's parents . " // Jim and Denny Ramsey of Newport Beach , Calif. are to be congratulated , but they could 've improved their timing . The Ramseys brought Tom into the world at almost the same time Jack and Janet Elway were producing another quarterback . His name is John and he plays for Stanford . // Ramsey has been playing in Elway 's shadow since their sophomore years in high school when Ramsey started for Kennedy and Elway started for Granada Hills , Kennedy 's archrival . Donahue recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palo Alto , where his career has inspired one long string of superlatives . Even Donahue ca n't help but gush : " He 's an animal . He 's in a class by himself . I think he 's the best college quarterback to come along since Joe Namath. " // No one is confusing Ramsey with Namath , but he has quietly carved a niche of his own at UCLA . Barring injury , by the end of this season he will have every UCLA passing record , surpassing the totals of , among others , Gary Beban , who was the Bruins ' only Heisman Trophy winner , in 1967 . Ramsey can throw long , short and on the run . He 's an excellent reader of defenses  --  his 50-yard touchdown pass to Flanker Dokie Williams late in the second quarter against Colorado came on an audible  --  and an outstanding leader . // Understandably , over the years Ramsey has grown weary of hearing about Elway . Yes , they 've met numerous times . No , they have n't talked quarter-backing that much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the big difference between him and Elway ? " The big difference is that they Stanford throw the ball 60 times a game , " says Ramsey . Well , maybe that 's coming your way , too , Tom . // UCLA Tight End Paul Bergmann , Ramsey 's closest friend , can speak to the Elway-Ramsey issue if anyone can because he was Elway 's favorite target at Granada Hills . But after meeting Ramsey in an all-star game , and deciding he did n't want to go to Stanford , Bergmann chose to follow Ramsey to UCLA . " I think Tom is about as complete a quarterback as you could want , " says Bergmann . " He can drop back and throw it , he can scramble , he has field presence , he has everything . No , he ca n't throw it 75 yards off his back foot like John can , but that 's just John . Nobody else can do that . But I do think Tom 's every bit as accurate as John . " // In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivers . Senior Cormac Carney , who leads the Bruins this season with 18 catches for 259 yards , has a reputation as a Fred Biletnikoff type : He has no particular strength but catches the ball whenever and wherever it 's thrown to him . With eight more receptions  --  he now has 80 for his career  --  he 'll supplant Kurt Altenberg as UCLA 's alltime leading receiver . Carney feels his reputation for being slow , if steady , is a bum rap ; his best 40-yard time is 4.7 , and he hopes defenses may loosen up on him after they see the films of the 40-yard bomb he caught from Ramsey on a straight fly pattern early in the second half against Colorado . And with a 3.5 grade average in psychology and a possibility of becoming a Rhodes scholar , Carney is also the man to hit when a semi-erudite quote is called for , as in : " One thing Tom Ramsey has done is maximize his physical potential . " // No one has made the most of things quite as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 8 " , 180-pound senior who has caught 17 passes for 310 yards . With 76 career receptions , he also should surpass Altenberg 's record . If Carney is Mr. Steady , Townsell is Mr. Spectacular . In the season opener against Long Beach State he caught TD passes of 23 , 48 , 32 and 18 yards from Ramsey in the first half . And in the comeback against Michigan he played a key role with seven catches for 108 yards . // Bergmann is Mr. In-Between . He has caught 12 balls for 203 yards , a 16.9 per-catch average . Bergmann , who as a senior has been around long enough to appreciate UCLA 's transformation this year , says he does n't mind blocking , but this pass-catching business is more fun . // And so it has been . Donahue is getting slapped on the back by entertained alumni and fans , and Los Angeles area newspaper writers have rechristened UCLA everything from UCLAir to UnCork Lots of Aerials . It 's a refreshing change that has already yielded a first for Donahue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Colorado game , Ramsey called over his teammates and , as they looked on , presented the Michigan game ball to Donahue , the only one he 's received since he took the UCLA head job . See what happens , Terry , when you let the kids put it up ?
