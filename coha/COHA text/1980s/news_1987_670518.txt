Physicists and philosophers have anguished over the experiment ever since , but one by one , nearly all have been compelled to abandon cherished theory in the face of its evidence. // The experimenters , Albert Abraham Michelson and Edward William Morley , set out to prove the existence of " ether " - an intangible and invisible fluid thought by most 19th-century scientists to permeate the entire universe . Michelson and Morley expected to demonstrate that ether speeded or slowed light waves ; if this were the case , the ether would represent a universal standard against which the positions and motions of everything in the universe could be measured. // Much to their consternation , they failed . But their failure was pivotal . A new generation of scientists , struggling to explain the shocking experiment , eventually demonstrated that nothing in the universe has absolute reality , and that causality itself ceases to operate at the microscopic level of existence. // The experiment was critical to Einstein ' s revolutionary contention that there is no such thing as a universal yardstick for space and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in Cleveland to begin a six-month observance of what many scientists regard as science ' s most crucial failure. // " I think it was the most important experiment ever performed , " said Dr. Philip L. Taylor , an organizer of the centennial . " If Michelson and Morley had obtained a different result , our whole view of space and time today would have been different. " // " It came at a time of transition from a period when science was dominated by wealthy amateurs to the era of true scientific professionals , " added Dr. Taylor , a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland . " Michelson , one of the first of these professionals , was also the first American to win a Nobel prize , in 1907 , for scientific achievement . " ( Only one other American , Theodore Roosevelt , had won a Nobel prize in any category . President Roosevelt received the peace prize in 1906 . ) Dr. Taylor said the experiment marked " the birth of modern physics in America . " But Michelson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fully accepted the radical interpretation developed for it by Einstein and other leading theorists. // Many experimenters before Michelson and Morley had demonstrated that light behaves in some ways like the waves that traverse bodies of water or the sound waves that travel through air . Reasoning by analogy , most of the world ' s leading scientists had therefore concluded that some kind of invisible medium analagous to air or water - the ether - must provide a medium for waves of light to propagate through space . The ether , they believed , pervaded the entire universe , perhaps even filling spaces occupied by solid matter. // The relative movement of the ether ought to have an effect on the speed of light passing through it , the theory went , just as the movement of water or air affects the speed of waves passing through them. // To test this idea , Michelson and Morley built a superbly tuned instrument designed to compare the speed of light moving in the same direction as the earth with the speed of light moving in a perpendicular direction . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slight but detectable difference should be evident in the speeds of light moving along perpendicular paths. // Michelson later explained the experiment to his daughter Dorothy while she was a child , and she recounted his explanation in her 1973 biography of her father ( The Master of Light , by Dorothy Michelson Livingston , published by Scribner ' s ) . Michelson compared the perpendicular light beams in his experiment to swimmers racing on a river. // " Two beams of light race against each other , " he told his daughter , " one struggling upstream and back , while the other , covering the same distance , just crosses and returns . The second swimmer will always win , if there is any current in the river. " // Michelson had begun work on the problem years earlier after an adventurous childhood . He had been born in Prussian-occupied Poland in 1852 , the son of a young merchant who was subjected to the anti-Semitic persecution of the period . At the age of three he emigrated with his family to the United States , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then in San Francisco . Michelson began his study of physics at the Naval Academy at Annapolis , where he earned a degree and a commission. // In 1880 he obtained leave from the Navy to pursue physics research in Germany , and in 1881 at Potsdam , Michelson conducted his first attempt to measure the supposed effect of the passing ether on the speed of light . The apparatus he designed was small but so sensitive that it could be thrown out of adjustment by the movement of traffic one hundred yards from the laboratory building. // Michelson ' s invention was an optical device called an interferometer , in which a beam of light was split into two parts which followed separate paths and were then brought together into a telescope , where the experimenter could observe the effect. // The technique , which Michelson refined in the 1920 ' s to make the first measurement of the diameter of a distant star , is now used routinely by astronomers. // Since light travels in waves , the combination of two or more beams of light waves results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result is a new crest representing the sum of the smaller crests . Two troughs produce one doubly deep trough , while a crest superimposed on a trough results in a null point , in which the wave is flat. // When two beams of light from the same source are made to travel separate paths of virtually identical length , their recombination results in a pattern visible through a telescope of vertical bright and dark stripes called " fringes . " The slightest alteration in the distance of either light path or of the speed of one of the light beams throws the light waves out of phase , changing the pattern. // Michelson lined up his apparatus so that one light beam would travel in the same direction as that of the earth , while the other light beam would travel perpendicular to it . By turning the apparatus Michelson hoped to detect shifts in fringe patterns that would reveal the effect of the ether. // He found no effect at all , but attributed his failure to excessive vibration and the inadequate sensitivity of his instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland , where he met Edward Morley , professor of chemistry at nearby Western Reserve University. // With the encouragement of Lord Rayleigh and other prominent European scientists who had heard of Michelson ' s work , Michelson and Morley began building a new version of Michelson ' s 1881 Potsdam experiment . In its Cleveland incarnation , the two parts of the split light beam were made to travel much longer perpendicular paths than in the earlier experiment . Errors caused by vibration were virtually eliminated by mounting the entire array of light source , beam splitter , 16 mirrors and observing telescope on a two-ton sandstone block . This , in turn , was mounted on a wooden turntable , and the entire unit was floated in a huge vat of mercury , isolating the experiment from all ground vibration. // On April 17 , 1887 , Morley wrote to his father to say that the new experiment had begun , " to see if light travels with the same velocity in all directions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they later reported . At the start of each observation period , they would give the mirror array a shove to set it turning on its axis in the mercury bath , and the inertia of the massive block would keep it rotating at about six revolutions per minute for the next half hour. // During this time , Michelson and Morley took turns walking around the mercury vat , eyes glued to the observing telescope on the rotating platform , taking care not to disturb the rotation by touching anything on the platform. // They continued the experiment over the next three months , making their final observations on July 12 , 1887 . At no time did they detect any change in the speed of light . Michelson ' s hopes of proving the existence of ether were dashed. // The Michelson and Morley collaboration ended the following year and never resumed , although both scientists separately conducted new variations of their experiment , always with negative results . Michelson was apparently so depressed by the failure of the experiment , his daughter later wrote , that he declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . " He may have felt a premonition that his experiment had put an end to the mechanical world with which he was familiar , " she wrote. // Einstein , the theorist for whom Michelson ' s work would ultimately have the greatest significance , was only eight years old at the time of the Michelson-Morley experiment . But two other mathematical theorists , Hendrik Antoon Lorentz of the Netherlands and George FitzGerald of Ireland , independently arrived at a startling explanation of the Michelson and Morley experiment . They observed that the negative result could be accounted for if the change in the speed of light were cancelled by a compensatory change in the distance of one of the light paths . In other words , they suggested , the light path in the direction of earth ' s movement actually became shorter because of earth ' s movement. // This hypothetical contraction of space as a consequence of motion , known as the Lorentz-FitzGerald Contraction , became an integral part of the Special Theory or Relativity published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , by entirely ignoring the notion of ether , to which his theory owed nothing . He showed that it is meaningless to speak of absolute velocities , and that motion shortens any body , increases its mass and slows the passage of time , as measured by a clock on the body . Einstein ' s astonishing 1905 paper was the progenitor of another Einstein paper that soon followed , containing the physicist ' s most famous equation , E-mc#2 , which expresses the equivalency of mass and energy. // At a ceremony in the 1920 ' s honoring Michelson , Einstein told him , " It was you who led the physicists into new paths , and through your marvelous experimental work paved the way for the development of relativity . You uncovered an insidious defect in the ether theory of light , as it then existed. " // According to Mrs. Livingston , who spent a decade of research reconstructing her father ' s career , Michelson himself never fully grasped or accepted the notions of relativity and quantum physics . To the end , he apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to Michelson in 1931 when Michelson lay dying , and his daughter remembers having asked Einstein , " please don ' t get him started on the subject of ether.
