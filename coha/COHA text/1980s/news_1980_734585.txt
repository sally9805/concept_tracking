txt AN ESTIMATED 20,000 people will die each year for the next 40 years from asbestos exposure , and little or nothing is being done about it , according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Cancer and other lung disease caused by exposuro to asbestos represent " a public health disaster of unprecedented dimensions , " the report said . Widespread industrial use of asbestos in the United States began during World War II . Because it usually takes 25 to 30 years for asbestos-caused diseases to develop , the full impact is just beginning to be felt , Dr. Irving J. Selikoff told the journal . Selikoff is director of the environmental sciences laboratory at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York . " Unless we learn the lessons of the past , we are destined to compound the deadly legacy of asbestos and start the clock ticking for the next 40 years , " he said . THERE IS NO effective treatment for asbestos-caused disease and no safe level of exposure , the Journal reported .

Adequate substitutes for the fire-resistant material have yet to he developed in many cases . Ten million workers are said to have been exposed to asbestos on the job since World War II , especially those in the shipbuilding industry .

" Things do n't always turn out for the best . Doctors know this perhaps best of all . Time does n't solve everything . I 'll just say that I have guarded pessimism about the whole thing .
