 | Eating in the microgravity of space is no picnic . Extrapolate the problems encountered by shuttle astronauts on short trips to the 90-day jaunts contemplated for crews on the manned space station , and you 've definitely got a non-attraction . So engineers at McDonnell Douglas are designing a special space galley ? shown in the artist 's concept above ? that will make the dining experience more palatable . It 's part of a $1.5 million contract awarded last April by NASAs Johnson Space Center , in Houston , for the preliminary design of the huge orbiting space station , scheduled for launch around 1993 . The kitchen will have to store a 90-day supply of food for six or seven crew members . It will contain a full complement of amenities ? now mostly lacking on the shuttle ? including a refrigerator , oven , freezer , dishwasher , trash compactor , food and trash storage , and an inventory-control system . The appliances will be adapted from earthbound kitchen gadgets to operate satisfactorily in a microgravity environment . The idea is to make meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our unremitting coverage of peculiar progeny , we bring you , in the picture below , Amo , Britain 's first zebra born via embryo transplant , alongside her bemused surrogate mother , Mahogany , a Welsh pony mare . The unlikely duo was photographed at the London Zoo . The birth was only the second of its kind in the world . It is the outgrowth of continuing research ? by biologists and veterinarians at the Zoological Society of London 's Institute of Zoology and the Thoroughbred Breeders ' Assn . Equine Fertility Unit at Cambridge ? into means of preserving rare and threatened species . Heart disease and cholesterol The much-debated question of how fatal heart disease and blood cholesterol levels in men are related has apparently been answered by an analysis of a massive study involving 356,222 subjects . In a report to the American Heart Assn. last November , Dr. Jeremiah Stamler , Chairman of the Dept. of Community Health and Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Medical School , Chicago , said there was " a strong and unequivocal relationship of serum cholesterol to risk for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure and men with high blood pressure . " Moreover , he said , increased risk begins at levels often considered harmless and then " is continuously graded progressively more dangerous the higher you go up the scale of blood cholesterol . " The study was part of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial , carried out at 25 centers nationwide ? the largest of its kind . The men who participated were divided into categories according to age and blood cholesterol level , and were followed for six years . In every age group , the incidence of fatal heart disease increased with the cholesterol level . For example , among the almost 79,000 men aged 40 to 44 , the fatal heart-attack rate was only 1.3 deaths per 1,000 men in six years for those in the lowest 20 percent of the serum cholesterol distribution , with levels less than 182 milligrams per deciliter ( mg/dL ) . But for the next higher 20 percent ? 182 to 202 mg/dL ( a level commonly judged safe ) ? the death rate was 77 percent higher . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death rate was 154 percent ( 2.54 times ) higher ; for the fourth 20 percent ? 222 to 245 mg/dL ? 269 percent ( 3.69 times ) higher ; and for the top 20 percent ? above 245 mg/dB ? 485 percent ( 5.85 times ) higher . The message is clear , says Stamler : Eat less animal and saturated fat and less cholesterol-containing food , which is the long-held position of the American Heart Assn. , the World Health Organization , and many other medical experts . Earthquake-nuclear risks How would a nuclear power plant survive a major earthquake ? like the one that devastated Mexico City last fall ? After five years of subjecting scale models of nuclear plants to the jolting forces of a " great " quake ? one registering more than 8.0 on the Richter FEBRUARY 1986 1 13  | scale ? experts at Los Alamos National Laboratory , in New Mexico , conclude that the plants would come through intact . " It 's an important finding . These buildings are very strong . They just will not collapse , " say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineering Technology Group . Some 31 miniaturized boxlike models , built with steel-reinforced walls and heavily instrumented , were tested as part of an ongoing program conducted for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . In the photo below , Anderson ( left ) and Bennett are preparing the largest scale model of its kind for a new series of tests . Nine feet high and 10 feet across , it has walls four inches thick and will be shaken at the U.S. Army 's Construction Engineering Research Laboratory , in Illinois . Stardust Using a helium-cooled detector of their own design aboard NASA 's Kuiper Airborne Observatory , University of Texas astronomers have discovered a ring or doughnut of dust around a newly created star in the Sharpless 106 nebula , the first time the shape of such a dust cloud has been seen clearly . The observations were made by Dr. Paul M. Harvey , Dr. Daniel F. Lester , and Marshall Joy , all of the Department of Astronomy of the University of Texas at Austin . Dust clouds around very young stars may be the origin of planetary systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat exchanger with a surprising geometry that promises a two- to four-times improvement in heat-transfer efficiency over conventional commercial units has been successfully tested at the Dept. of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory , near Chicago . The chief innovation of the new design , according to Anthony Thomas , manager of Argonne 's Heat Exchanger Test Facility , is the spirally fluted surface seen in the photo above . In a typical exchanger , a series of tubes carries a fluid through a cylindrical shell containing a second fluid ; heat is transferred from one fluid to the other through the walls . In the Argonne design , a series of small triangular tubes about one inch in diameter run in a spiral along the inside and outside surfaces . The fluting increases the surface area of the cylinder and guides the fluid flow ( the test used ammonia and hot water ) . This approach , Thomas says , " increases heat-exchanger performance 1.7 times over that of a heat exchanger that uses simple , smooth tubes . " He predicts that the design could significantly increase performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refining , and power-generating systems that reclaim and use waste heat . It could also be used in geothermal and ocean thermal-energy systems , both of which rely on heat transfer to generate electricity . Spark plugs out ? Antoni Oppenheim , a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 's Applied Science Division and a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California , Berkeley , is pursuing combustion research that may lead to the elimination of spark plugs in future auto engines . Redesigning the operating conditions of the engines , he says , would mean lower pollution , higher fuel efficiency , and an end to the $10 billion socked to consumers each year for the extra cost of producing high-octane gasoline . " Controlled combustion is the key , " says Oppenheim . " The chemistry now being done at the petroleum refinery and later in the catalytic converter .. . could be done in the car engine 's cylinder . " The rate of combustion in today 's cars is so slow , he says , that the octane number of gas distilled from crude oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very expensive process . Oppenheim 's group has found that the most promising alternative to conventional spark plugs is a combination of combustion jet ignitors and recirculation of exhaust gas from the previous combustion cycle . Back testing Orthopedists at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas are developing techniques for testing and treating victims of low back pain using isokinetic equipment such as the Cybex Corp . rotation device shown in the photo below . Low back pain afflicts 70 to 90 percent of the U.S. population at some point in their lives , and is the number-one cause of disability in those under 45 ( number three in those older ) . Three different Cybex trunk-testing machines are being used . The machines measure three different aspects of a person 's trunk strength : extension and flexion. torso rotation , and lifting ability . Graphic printouts display effort , pain . and fatigue , as well as inappropriate movements . The research is also being extended to the training of dancers and athletes .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
