Unless the Communists suddenly reverse political course , authorities here say , they will pose a serious threat to President Corazon C. Aquino ' s efforts to revive the economy and restore democracy. // With a flexible strategy loosely based on Mao Zedong ' s precept of using the countryside to surround the cities and exploiting widespread popular discontent , the Communists have fashioned a nationwide network that mixes so-called liberated zones in the villages with safe houses , secret party cells and clandestine couriers in the cities. // All figures about the Communists are somewhat hazy and should be treated with caution .

And Bayan , a legal united front organization that many Filipino moderates assert is really controlled by the Communists , has another 2. 3 million members. // In the last few years , especially since the popular protests after the assassination of Mrs. Aquino ' s husband , Benigno S.

" Going to the hills " to join the New People ' s Army became a fashionable trend in the years of President Ferdinard E. Marcos ' s rule , much like radical chic in the United States in the late 1960 ' s. // " The N.P.A. may have a higher percentage of really smart leaders than any other Communist movement , " an American military analyst said. // Some Filipinos believe that the Communists will not succeed . They point to the example of this week , when the unpopular , ineffective Marcos Government was peacefully ousted by hundreds of thousands of people supporting Mrs. Aquino . The phenomenon , they contend , suggests that moderates in the Philippines retain great appeal and power. // " I think the Communists will now wither away , " said Joker Arroyo , a civil liberties lawyer who defended many men accused by Mr. Marcos of being Communists and who has been appointed executive secretary in President Aquino ' s new Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Struggle ' to Go On // But the Communists assert they will continue their basic strategy of " armed struggle.

It is not even certain whether Mrs. Aquino will honor her campaign pledge to begin a six-month cease-fire with the New People ' s Army . Her senior military advisers have called for stepping up the war. // According to the Philippine military , the New People ' s Army killed 144 Government officials and 1 , 203 civilians last year , although the poorly trained army of 230 , 000 men may have lost nearly 5 , 000 men killed or wounded , an American official believes . <> <> Taxes Paid to Rebels // With the insurgency growing rapidly , the Philippine military has been unable to protect large parts of this nation of scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New People ' s Army on his timber land in Mindanao .

Ireneo Gordoncillo , a priest in Bacolod who keeps track of military abuses , said he did not monitor incidents of violence by the New People ' s Army . " Probably the army does , " he said .

And they are starting to tax their own supporters more heavily. " // The Lawyers ' Committee for Human Rights , a New York-based organization , contended in a report last December that the Communists were responsible for a growing number of killings of Government officials , beatings of people who refused to pay their taxes and the slayings of villagers they suspected might inform on them. // Ka Joyce denied the charge .

" <> <> In Revenge for Atrocities // He insisted that the only killing the New People ' s Army did was in revenge for Government atrocities . Last September , for instance , 27 demonstrators were shot and killed by soldiers in front of the city hall in the town of Escalante . Gen. Fidel V. Ramos , now Chief of Staff in Mrs. Aquino ' s new Government , ordered an investigation , but no one has been prosecuted. // So the New People ' s Army compiled its own list of the guilty , Ka Joyce said . Three men have been killed so far , one this month as he got off a bus in Bacolod to buy cigarettes . The rebel group has also put up posters in the central market in Bacolod , saying , " Wanted , Dead or Alive , " for the Mayor of Escalante , the provincial Governor and the army general in command at the time of the massacre. // For some reason , the Government has not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtually normal existence in Bacolod - staying in one home for long periods of time and traveling by public transportation - thinks it is because the army is " very sloppy. " // In this predominantly Roman Catholic country , where the reverence for clerics was demonstrated over the last few days by their ability to stop troops loyal to President Marcos from attacking rebel officers , the Communists have benefited enormously from having priests and nuns allied with them . <> <> ' A Moral Voice ' // " It gives them a moral voice and a way to reach the people they wouldn ' t otherwise have , " said the Rev. John Carroll , the director of the Institute for Church and Social Issues at the Ateneo de Manila University , a Jesuit-run school. // But the Communist Party of the Philippines , which was formed by a group of 11 young professors and students who broke away from the old Moscow-oriented Partido Komunista Ng Pilinpas , founded in 1930 , has made mistakes of its own .

Instead , under the leadership of Jose Maria Sison , a brilliant philosophy teacher at the University of the Philippines , the Communists gradually devised a strategy to take advantage of the dispersed nature of the country. // The concept was to spread out all around the Philippines and prevent the Government forces from concentrating in one area , as they had been able to do against the earlier Communist Huk army in central Luzon in the late 1940 ' s. // " The key was to be flexible , not to try to hold a base area when the enemy advanced , " Ka Joyce said . <> <> Buildup in Mindanao // At the same time , the Communists built up their forces in Mindanao , the least developed part of the Philippines , drawing Government troops away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation reminiscent of North Vietnamese tactics in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. // In the last few years , with Mao ' s policies on the eclipse in China and Peking supporting the continued presence of American bases in the Philippines as a buffer against Soviet military expansion , the Philippine Communists have begun to study the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. // " Nicaragua is a Catholic country like the Philippines , and the Sandinistas made good use of a broad united front combined with armed struggle , " Ka Joyce said. // The Philippine Communists ' efforts to build a united front has run into trouble in the last year , however . Last spring , when Bayan was formed , some Communists manipulated the voting for the Executive Council by secretly distributing two different lists of names , according to Mr. Arroyo , President Aquino ' s executive secretary . As a result , their own candidates won the choice spots , he charged , including the appointment of the relatively unknown Lean Alejandro , 25 years old , as secretary general. // Mr. Arroyo and a number of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Boycott of Election // Mr. Arroyo and other supporters of Mrs. Aquino were further alienated when Bayan and the Communists decided to boycott the presidential election Feb. 7 because she refused to accept their demand for a platform that included the removal of the American bases from the Philippines , a far-reaching land program and a repudiation of the Philippines ' $26. 5 billion foreign debt. // " The Communists have become very dogmatic , " Mr. Arroyo asserted . " It ' s a pity , because they have fought longer and suffered many more casualties to get rid of Marcos than the rest of us. " // But around Bacolod , in Negros , the Communists have enjoyed a major success , their fastest growth of any area in the Philippines. // The 300 , 000 sugar cane workers here have long been among the poorest people in the country , living on haciendas run like feudal baronries .

" He added , " We educate people through the Bible to realize their plight , and then they can see the need for militant armed struggle to get rid of the imperialist rule that is the root of the problem.

Rebel organizers hold nightly teach-ins in the houses of sugar workers virtually within the city limits , said Jose Maria Locsin , a wealthy plantation owner of Chinese descent whose ancestors received a land grant from the Spanish throne two centuries ago. // Out in the canefields that run in a long wave of green from Bacolod up to Kanlaon , a 4 , 000-foot active volcano , Bernie Jayman , an organizer for the sugar workers ' union , believes a real revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Aquino , is inevitable .
