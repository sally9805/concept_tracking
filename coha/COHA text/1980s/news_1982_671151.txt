He apparently holds the old-fashioned view that as Secretary of State he has no foreign policy of his own , only that of his President. // He also has quietly told his staff that he does not appreciate disclosures to the press . No threats have been voiced , but an appeal has been made to senior officials to act as gentlemen and keep confidences. // As a result of all this , there is a discernible shift in emphasis at the State Department these days , away from the personal role of the Secretary of State in the management of foreign policy . Consider Mr. Shultz ' s attitude toward foreign travel. // His predecessors , Alexander M. Haig Jr . , Edmund S. Muskie , Cyrus R. Vance and Henry A. Kissinger , were ready to be airborne at the first hint of diplomatic problems overseas . Mr. Kissinger logged 656 , 800 miles ; Mr. Vance , 459 , 568 , and Mr. Haig , 237 , 586. // Mr. Shultz says he has no desire to emulate them . To drive home his point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East and try to settle the Lebanese situation himself. // In Mr. Shultz ' s view , the United States Government has spent a lot of money on modern communications equipment . It has trained diplomats at considerable expense to learn foreign languages and has built embassies in virtually every capital to house those diplomats . Why not , he asks , let them carry the primary responsibility for dealing with crises as they come up , getting overall direction from the State Department hierarchy ? // Mr. Shultz is convinced , his aides say , that his predecessors chepeaned the value of diplomatic trips by going abroad too often . He intends to ration his travel , going only on missions of critical importance. // This does not bar the kind of routine consultative good-will mission that Mr. Shultz made to Ottawa the other day . But it does represent an effort by him to restore the prestige of the ambassadors and the career Foreign Service people . That is why Morris Draper , and not Mr. Shultz , is in the Middle East today dealing with Lebanon. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said or written about him , according to his aides . They say he often does not read the morning newspapers , or at best glances at the headlines . He does not as a rule watch the evening news on television. // Occasionally his aides bring to his attention articles they feel he should know about , but say he rarely comments . There have been other top Washington officials who have not cared what was written about them , but they have been rare indeed . Mr. Reagan himself has been known to call and complain personally to both broadcasters and print journalists , as have a number of prominent public figures such as Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert H. Humphrey. // Mr. Shultz has told his aides that he believes foreign policy has too often been formulated in public debate whereas he would prefer more emphasis on quiet diplomacy . This approach has been evident in his handling of one of the most delicate policy problems he has faced since taking office , trying to resolve the dispute with Western European allies over construction of the Siberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed sanctions against some European companies after they supplied the Soviets with pipeline parts that incorporated American technology. // Publicly , Mr. Shultz has strongly supported Mr. Reagan ' s decision . But as has become increasingly apparent , he has also worked behind the scenes to persuade Mr. Reagan and others in the Administration to replace the sanctions with a declaration by the United States and its allies that no new natural gas contracts would be signed with the Soviets and no more subsidized credits would be extended them. // Mr. Shultz was able to persuade Mr. Reagan to accept this compromise through a succession of conversations in which he argued that such a declaration would have more impact on the Russians than the sanctions . By avoiding a confrontation within the Administration , Mr. Shultz demonstrated that he had learned what Mr. Haig apparently had not , that Mr. Reagan prefers achieving a consensus to having to make choices from within his circle of advisers. // Mr. Haig had staked his personal prestige on not imposing the sanctions . In that context , any retreat from them would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shultz , on the other hand , can assert that there is no change but , instead , that the President has decided on a " tougher " approach. // In a sense , the Administration ' s approach to policymaking with Mr. Shultz at State has similarities to the way the Japanese Government does business . Policy matters are talked about at length behind the scenes , with decisions made only when there is a consensus , when no one is likely to lose face. // By avoiding the limelight and saying very little in public , Mr. Shultz has , however , remained something of a mystery not only to the press but to most of the State Department . A number of Foreign Service officers say he has not yet passed on a clear idea of where he wants to change policies , if at all. // In part this is due to the fact that Mr. Shultz was thrust into his job suddenly , without much time to contemplate the world scene . He has brought to his post the skills of an economist and management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems facing the United States around the world. // Mr. Shultz seems to recognize this . He insists on having a free hour or two each day in his schedule in which to contemplate issues . Otherwise , he says , he risks spending all his time dealing with the day-to-day problems without producing his own vision of where the United States should go in the world. // Even if Mr. Shultz does produce a global policy , however , he is more likely than not to say that it is really his President ' s. //
