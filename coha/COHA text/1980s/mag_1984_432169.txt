 | From a distance , on the snowy streets of Chicago , she could be a coed off to a football game . But get close to the woman called Teddy Bear ? her real name is Dolores ? and you see that her long woolen coat , preppy sweater , dark pants and sturdy boots have not been donned for a day 's outing . She has slept in them . Herblackhair has n't been combed . It is falling over her dark eyes and onto her bruised face . Teddy Bear 's friend Elizabeth also favors pants and sweaters for Chicago 's icy weather . She has a quilted coat for the winter but so far has been unable to find boots wide enough for her feet . So she sticks to the Trax running shoes she got during one of her periodic stays at a Veterans Administration hospital . Elizabeth 's hair is cut tomboy short ? a throwback to her adolescent days . She can still execute a flying leap , too , the kind she did back in convent school . Sometimes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The social workers call them homeless women . They call themselves street girls ? a motley group scrounging scraps and small change , bag ladies who carry their world around with them or stash it at a friend 's home or have nothing left to stash . They sleep in abandoned buildings , overnight shelters , sleazy welfare hotels or with men who take them in for the sake of kindness or sex . They all have one thing in common : fear . Fear of not finding a safe , warm place for the night , fear of not getting the meal ? or drink ? they need , fear of rape or of losing what little they possess . Even the most deranged bag ladies , who just want to be left alone , are vulnerable because of rumors that they keep money in their bags . On the streets , says Elizabeth , " you have to have eyes behind your head and look like you 're not scared . " She used to carry a shopping bag with clothes and soap and a toothbrush , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth , who looks older than her 37 years . Now she keeps clean underwear at the apartment of a divorced woman friend who lets her take a shower now and then . " I have n't carried a purse since I was mugged , " she says . " I 've had medication prescribed for my depression , but there 's no use carrying that around ? they 'll take it . " Teddy Bear , 28 , carries nothing ; she ends up selling everything for the price of a drink . The hulking body that earned Teddy Bear her name is swollen from wine . " A doctor told me my body is going to give out if I do n't stop drinking , " she says . " I was doing OK for a few months . I have this friend and she helped me stop drinking and made me think I could get off the streets for good . " But now her welfare check goes for drink again , when her sometime boyfriend does n't take it from her . She does n't have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it means she 'll end up with a black eye . " We fight all the time , " says Teddy Bear . So she wanders the streets looking for him ? or anyone else who might have liquor . Like many street people , Teddy Bear 's past is hazy . She says she is an orphan , but others say she has a mother and four brothers who keep trying to get her off the bottle and the streets . Whatever the truth , Elizabeth says she understands Teddy Bear 's drinking problem , because she still carries the scars from her own heavier drinking days ? like the one on her wrist from putting it through a saloon window . " I was angry at the bartender for serving me when I 'd already had too much , " she recalls . " It 's the whisky and vodka that makes you so violent you wind up in jail on a drunk-anddisorderly charge . It feels like there 's a tornado in your stomach and your head feels like you got hit with a sledgehammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Elizabeth has had to worry about a roof over her head . " I was married four years to an electrical-engineering student , but he was a Pakistani from a strict Islamic upbringing where they did n't like women going out at night . I 've always been a night person , and when he told me that I was the camel and he was the driver , that did it . After the divorce I was too depressed to work , and after four months of not being able to pay the rent , I came home one day to find the locks changed . So I hit the streets . It was cold , but I found an open Datsun to sleep in at night . When the owner saw me one morning he brought out a blanket and apologized for not letting me sleep inside , but five weeks of sleeping in that car landed me in the VA hospital with pneumonia . " On a recent evening , Elizabeth sought shelter in the basement of Chicago 's Uptown Baptist Church , where Teddy Bear often spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know the shelter is safer than the streets or the subway , " Elizabeth admits . " But the smell of dirty bodies is like rotting flesh , and it will get worse by morning . I worry about getting lice from the blankets or sores on my mouth if someone spits in the coffee . " So out into the snow she goes , hoping that the Cuban guy who sometimes lets her stay in his room is home and sober . " I 'm kind of scared of him since he pulled a knife on me a week ago when he was drinking that crazy rotgut vodka . But at least he 's not the type that would make a woman work the streets . How am I going to get married again in this predicament ? " The best resource for the street women of uptown Chicago is Sarah 's Circle , a women 's drop-in center open five days a week . It 's not only the coffee and snacks and the Wednesday-afternoon bingo that draws them . It 's the unintimidating , lived-in atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of House and Garden . There is a kindness at Sarah 's , not only from the NEWSWEEK/JANUARY 2 , 1984  | volunteers but also from other women who have been through whatever you are going through and want to help . They throw their arms around Teddy Bear , tell sympathetic stories about being beaten by their own " old men " ? and talk tough about wanting to punch them out . And whereas shelters provide the bare essentials of existence , a place like Sarah 's also can permit a homeless woman to reorganize her life and perhaps get on her feet again . A young black woman called Jane is trying to do that ? using a sink at the center to wash her clothes regularly and the comfortable lounge to study books from the public library . Unlike the library , where you 're asked to leave if you 're caught dozing off , Sarah 's understands how tired a woman can be after a wary night at a crowded shelter . For everyone on the street , life is a matter of improvising . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops at a city garage where they let you use the bathroom and just sit in the warmth for a while . Then it 's on to the US Submarine Shop , where you can get a large cup of coffee in a Styrofoam cup for 50 cents ? a much better deal than at the coffee shop across the street where you get a seat at a table , a cup and saucer , but a lot less coffee . " I do n't like to give them my patronage , " harrumphs Elizabeth like the greatest of grandes dames . But then the high-strung , fast-talking extrovert slows down , revealing a flash of the severely depressed woman who still needs medication and periodic hospitalization . The holidays make her introspective . " I never thought it would happen to me , " Elizabeth says . " It 's all my fault ? I ca n't seem to get my life together . I 'm sort of the black sheep of a strict Catholic family . Even if I could n't be a nun , like I wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . But my family has n't spoken to me much since I gave my baby daughter up for adoption 10 years ago . Really , she 's far better off than I am ? living in the suburbs with parents who love her ? but my mother always told me that the worst thing you can do is give up your own flesh and blood . I should have been strong enough to keep my daughter . I should be strong enough to get myself out of this predicament . " Teddy Bear , meanwhile , is coming off a binge and hardly notices the holiday season . She wins a Christmas tree in a drawing at Sarah 's Circle , and immediately talks about selling it . She 's not ready to accept a missionary 's offer to sleep off her hangover at an available apartment . " There 's too much pressure there not to drink , " says Dolores . As for the danger that awaits her in the streets , she says , " The only thing they can do to me is kill me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it anymore . "
