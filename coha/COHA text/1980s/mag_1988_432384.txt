 | Pictures on a six-foot projection-TV screen at StereoGraphics Corp . in San Rafael , Calif. , appear fuzzy at first . A ceiling-mounted projector beams bright images from a demonstration tape . Then I slip on what appear to be lightly tinted sunglasses . The screen instantly becomes a huge underwater porthole into a fantastic world of three-dimensional TV . The screen images , videotaped in 3-D from a submersible 6,000 feet beneath the ocean surface off Bermuda last summer , become sharp and colorful . There 's no eyestrain , which often accompanies 3-D viewing . Suddenly a shark noses toward the camera , seeming to lunge into the room . In another eerie scene hundreds of snakelike eels converge on a long vertical column of bait . Such 3-D video realism , beamed from StereoGraphics ' costly industrial-model hardware , is among the best available these days . But with interest in 3-D climbing to one of its periodic peaks , there 's also a growing range of alternatives for home TV screens : Toshiba is introducing a camcorder for taping 3-D movies yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available . In Japan 3-D videodiscs have long been in stores ; 3-D discs and video cassetttes may soon be sold here . The Coca-Cola Co. , a sponsor of ABC 's popular " Moonlighting " series , hopes to distribute 40 million pairs of 3-D glasses for an advertisement and season-ending program segment . And for budget 3-D TV , one California design firm plans to license an add-on system that could cost less than $100 for adapter , glasses , and 3-D video cassette . While each of these 3-D packages demands special viewing glasses , researchers in some labs are trying to develop 3-D TV you can watch without glasses . A little background helps in understanding the newest developments . Most 3-D TV systems rely on simple binocular vision to create depth : When your eyes and brain see objects from slightly different perspectives , a sense of depth , called stereopsis , results . The first gadget to exploit stereopsis , the mirror stereoscope , was invented in 1833 by Sir Charles Wheatstone . He created pairs of drawings , each slightly different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-D image when viewed through mirrors . Pairs of photographs and simpler mirrorless stereoscopes soon updated . the original design . " In their day the stereoscope and stereo views were the equivalent of television and photojournalism , " notes StereoGraphics president Lenny Lipton in his 1982 book on 3-D movies and TV . This binocular viewing principle ? a separate view for each eye ? has carried over to most movie and TV systems . In the early 1920s , for example , some small theaters used film projectors that alternately beamed left and right images onto a screen . Mechanical shutters inside a viewer at your seat were electrically synchronized to the projectors , blocking your left eye when the right image appeared and vice versa . Shuttered movies could n't deliver images rapidly enough to each eye . Another 1920s 3-D technique , filming left and right views though red-and-blue or red-and-green filters , then viewing them through similar filters , did catch on ( see drawings ) . But the real boom in 3-D movies began in the 1950s , two decades after Edwin Land 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter light so it travels only in certain planes . Other polarizing filters , oriented differently , then effectively block either left or right images from the screen . With all these techniques , why have n't 3-D movies caught on in theaters or on home TV screens ? Experts I talked with blame poor attention to technical details . Proper alignment of the two stereo images is crucial to prevent eyestrain and headaches . " Stereo has gotten a bad name because of attempts by people who were n't fanatic about lining up images , " explains John O. Merritt , a 3-D consultant with Interactive Technologies in Williamsburg . Mass . " We 're fairly sophisticated visually these days , " adds StereoGraphics ' Lipton . " It 's inconceivable to me that the public will now accept flickering images or images that require you to wear red-and-blue glasses . " TV broadcasts requiring colored glasses are usually disasters because colors are notoriously erratic on screens , and cheap color glasses are rarely matched to color-screen phosphors . Result : little depth , blurring , and headaches . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is emerging as a solution ? at least for viewing home video . The LC material is similar to that in digital wrist-  | watch displays and other electronic gear . Like the mechanical shutters in 1920s movie theaters , the LC shutters can alternately block vision to your left and right eyes ( see drawings ) . But the LC material , built into glasses , enables the left and right views to be displayed almost simultaneously ? a failure of the 1920s technology . Still , LC glasses are n't trouble free . In his Glendale , Calif. , lab , engineer and inventor Stephen Hines shows me a simple cure for a common 3-D problem : flicker . Hines pops a disk into his Atari 1040ST computer while I sit behind a color monitor and slip on a $99 pair of LC glasses . An amazing 3-D demonstration program dubbed " Steely Boink , " goes into action . Metal-like spheres , each bearing an image of the program 's creator , bounce randomly around a room , reflecting details of its interior and casting shadows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall with the same hue . ( Antic Publishing Co. in San Francisco markets the glasses and a growing variety of 3-D software . ) " Try adjusting the brightness just beneath the screen , " says Hines when I complain about a slight , but irritating , flicker . Dimming the picture just slightly eliminates the problem . Flicker develops because of the switching technique used with most LC glasses : With ordinary TV both of your eyes see 60 pictures every second . Each picture . called a field , is actually half of a complete interlaced TV picture , or frame . Many new 3-D products use these ' / ; usecond picture fields to display images first to one eye . then the other . As a result each eye , alternately shuttered by LC glasses , receives a new picture 30 times a second instead of twice that rate . At high brightness levels . the eye-brain perceives a flicker . Hines , a tall , slim man , built the 3-D camera assembly used for two Disney movies , and seems to be anticipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a universal dual-camera mount he 's invented onto a bench . As he spins knobs and moves mechanisms back and forth , he describes how the device will enable directors to control the depth effects of 3-D images easily . A week earlier , using Toshiba 's new $2,800 camcorder , I became an amateur 3-D movie cameraman and director . This dual-lens dual-image-sensor VHS-C machine also requires LC glasses for playback and records with the socalled " field-sequential " technique " 3-D Camcorder , " Jan . . It 's simple to operate . But I quickly discovered that unlike my conventional 2-D 8mm camcorder , 3-D scenes demand objects at varying distances to convey a good sense of depth . Toshiba 's black-box 3-D adapter , which plugs into the camcorder and your TV , has jacks for three of the big wraparound 3-D LC goggles Toshiba provides . The goggles fit @# comfortably over glasses and have fairly dense filters to minimize flicker . In a bright fluorescent-lit office , with a bright TV , flicker became unbearable despite the goggle filters . But on my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicker . The sacrifice for a stomach-churning roller-coaster ride from Toshiba 's 3-D demo tape : picture brightness and contrast . Similar flicker occurred with the Sega video game I tried , which also uses LC glasses and sequentially displayed fields ? like Toshiba 's camcorder or 3-D software for the Atari computer . Again , low room lights and moderate set brightness cured the flicker problem as I tried to zap missiles with Sega 's light-sensitive pistol ( see photo ) . Games from both Sega and Nintendo are stored on solid-state plug-in memory cartridges . I also tried a book-size prototype 3-D adapter from Sharp  | that plugs into any VCR . A demonstration tape delivered good 3-D pictures . While Sharp has n't announced plans for marketing the adapter or tapes , it 's likely some company will introduce a VCR adapter and software . Similarly , with renewed interest in 3-D , videodiscs are also likely to appear in this country . StereoGraphics seems to have found the best cure for flicker . Although it too uses field-sequential recording and playback techniques , I could n't detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's because StereoGraphics ' 3-D hardware all operates at twice the rate ? 120 hertz ? of standard TVs . Lhary Meyer , vice president and technical director , tugs at his beard as he explains : " In our scheme every one of the one-sixtieth-second views has a left and a right image encoded into it . When it runs on our system there are 120 views per second . Because it 's going left right , left right , you have sixty views per second per eye . " The electronic encoding makes pictures ? two per view ? seem compressed and flattened on ordinary monitors . But the technique permits pictures to be recorded on standard VCRs , and flicker-free 3-D images appear normal during playback , despite some missing vertical detail . The firm also performs clever tricks with polarized light so that simple lightweight glasses , without the usual electrical wire connected to them , can be worn . The singletube overhead projector has an electrically powered polarizing system in front of its lens . This circular polarizer twists light for one field clockwise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installs such polarizers on CRT displays that measure up to 19 inches diagonally . Circularly polarized elements in the viewing glasses block the appropriate fields for 3-D imaging . These glasses also let you tilt your head , unlike ordinary plane-polarized lenses , which no longer block light effectively if you tilt them several degrees . The 3-D displays can also be hooked up to work with more-conventional . @#  | LC goggles switched at higher speeds to eliminate flicker . Such a sophisticated 3-D viewing system created a problem when it had to be used by the public in an exhibit . The National Geographic Society , which had taped the underwater views off Bermuda with StereoGraphics ' gear , decided to display the remarkable scenes at its exhibit hall in Washington , D.C. The exhibit simulates views from an underwater diving vehicle . " You could n't hand visitors goggles , they 'd destroy them , " said Meyer . " And you could n't give them viewing glasses because they 're expensive and vulnerable . " The solution : StereoGraphics made a five-by-seven-inch filter , used to simulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitors . " There 's no other way to look through it without putting your nose near the split at the middle , " explains Meyer . An electronic line-doubling device enhances vertical resolution on monitors at the exhibit , which is currently open to the public . With a typical price of $33,000 for a color system , StereoGraphics must aim its hardware at specialized markets ; but , says Lipton , " We have a technology that would be perfectly adaptable for consumer products " He adds that a major electronics firm has been using its hardware to conduct market research throughout the country . In contrast to this high-end complex hardware , when I stepped into a small lab at The Bright &; Morning Star Co. in Torrance , Calif. , I encountered lowcost 3-D simplicity . This design group , which specializes in creating toys , unveiled one type of viewing device five years ago I " 3-D Optical Blender , " Nov. ' 831 . You slip a pair of photos at a right angle to each other into a cube-shaped gadget . A Fresnel lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for any glasses . While CRTs might be substituted for photos an expensive technique ? only one person can view 3-D at a time with the device , which never took off . Now I 'd come to view a new 3-D viewing device that Elliot Rudell , Bright &; Morning Star 's managing general partner , claimed could be set up in front of a TV in 15 seconds ; also that it used only simple polarized glasses and could be marketed for $50 to $100 ? including a 3-D video cassette . In the lab , Rudell slid open a drawer on a flat black box that at first looked like a decorative base for the TV set resting on it . In seconds he flipped up a two-section polarizing screen before the picture tube , then , farther back , he positioned a large rectangular Fresnel lens ( see drawing ) . Moments later , with a lightweight polarized filter clipped to my glasses , I watched 3-D Disney productions and other films from demonstration video cassettes . The 3-D movies had been recorded with views for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views for the other eye on the bottom ? a so-called " over-under " format . The flip-up optics encoded and blended the two images , while the filters on my glasses created fairly good 3-D images . But the pictures ? in a curious wide-screen-like format ? occupied only half the slightly magnified screen area . And the viewing area seemed restricted to perhaps two or three closely spaced viewers . Rudell is negotiating licenses to market the system and expects it will be available by the end of the year . " There are probably fifty to one hundred 3-D color movies available right now that have no value on the consumer marketplace , " he says . " What we 're proposing is that someone market them . " He also demonstrated a simple prism attachment for his conventional 8mm Sony camcorder that produced fair do-it-yourself 3-D recordings , which occupied only the right half of the TV screen . If Rudell 's flip-up fold-down optical system is budget 3-D , another technique I saw at Nuoptix Inc. is real bargain basement for viewers . That 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of a Coke , for viewing glasses to try this technique . The 3-D producers , I discovered , need lots of money . Nuoptix , located in Westlake Village , Calif. , specializes in optical sound tracks for film and digitized audio recordings . It is working with Coca-Cola and ABC to produce short 3-D segments for the final 1988 segment of " Moonlighting " Nuoptix president Terry Beard demonstrates the unusual 3-D technique that Coca-Cola and ABC plan to use . He hands me a pair of cardboard glasses with the left lens section blank ; a piece of faintly purple plastic fills the right section . First , without the need for these curious glasses Beard runs a videotape that demonstrates a new filmto-tape transfer process Nuoptix developed . A whirling toy carousel , with colored dots on its rim , appears on a TV screen . Initially the toy has been filmed at a standard 24 frames per second . " Notice the jitter , particularly the dots , " Beard says . The next sequence , shot at 30 frames a second , seems slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second appears , the dots that once seemed fuzzy stand out with remarkable clarity . " It 's dramatic , " says Beard . " That 's the kind of difference people will notice when they watch our 3-D process " The transfer process , which has applications other than enhancing the upcoming 3-D scenes , involves converting film images into computerized digital TV images , then back into standard TV signals . It 's a complex , time-consuming , and costly process . And filming scenes at up to 120 frames a second eats up a lot more film . While TV viewers without 3-D glasses should see enhanced picture clarity , according to Beard , those with the glasses or even viewers who cover their right eye with a sunglass lens ? should see dramatic 3-D effects . I noticed some 3-D depth from a demonstration tape that showed toys spinning on a turntable . What will make the ABC segments unusual is that some type of horizontal motion is necessary to create a 3-D illusion . Such motion , Beard explains , provides important clues for stereopsis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique is much more than a simple demonstration of the well-known Pulfrich effect involving horizontal movement ( see photo and pendulum drawing ) . " Pulfrich speculated that it was a simple delay from filtering one eye , but it 's not a simple delay " says Beard . He pulled studies from his files which show that time delays from a filter are too brief ? less than 10/i 00o of a second ? to account for traditional explanations of the Pulfrich effect . If the " Moonlighting " sequence is successful , the 3-D process may turn up in a TV sports special preceding the Summer Olympics and in other programs . Beard also hints @#  | that a derivative of the technique might be used with special film-projection methods such as Showscan , which already stimulates extra realism with super-size screens and movies that are filmed at high speed to capture more visual information . Hologramlike trees Perhaps the most unusual 3-D demonstration I saw appeared on a compact film-projection system set up in downtown Los Angeles by Robert Collender of 3-D Vision Co . Collender , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stereoptiplexer for years . " Of all the 3-D schemes , it 's the hardest to make sense of , " says Lhary Meyer . " It 's really bizarre that it works . " Collender pulled a drumlike object from a carrying case and set it atop a small table . He then attached reels for a conventional 16mm film that he had made at Disneyland , so the film ran horizontally through the Stereoptiplexer . A book-size projector screen , made with horizontally brushed aluminum , protruded above the drum . " This machine just demonstrates the principle , " said Collender , who has obtained worldwide patent rights to expand the system for TV applications . ( This expanded design , however , still awaits financing . ) Collender flicked a toggle switch . A motor in the machine slowly accelerated an optical scanning device inside to 1,500 rpm . He snapped on another switch and 3-D pictures flashed on the metal screen . No glasses , polarizers , or other conventional 3-D hardware were involved . All the images were scenes photographed from a moving car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prototype system . The movement creates motion parallax , a strong visual clue for depth perception . " See that tree ? " he asked . " Now move to the side and look around the tree . " As I stepped to either side of the screen , I could see hidden objects , just as though I were viewing a real scene ? or a hologram , another type of true 3-D image captured with laser light . While film moves through his Stereoptiplexer at normal speed , Collender explained , some 26 pictures are in the field of view at one time . But in addition , the high-speed optical system spinning inside the machine is producing the equivalent of some 2,000 frames per second , sweeping them out onto the screen . For his planned switch to a nonmechanical TV system , Collender expects to use one of the many projection systems , such as liquid-crystal dis-@# plays , now under development . The conversion to electronics would eliminate all the spinning mechanisms from his no-glasses projector , called an autostereoscopic system . And while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current hardware , electronics could solve the problem : A pair of video cameras could provide stereo views , while picture-generating circuits would generate numerous missing views between the cameras based on the two real images captured . Meanwhile , at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , researcher Stephen Benton is brewing what might become the ultimate in autostereoscopic viewing : holographic TV . Much work remains . The first crude image is still months away . " We 're trying to transmit holograms in real time , " says Benton , " bringing holographic TV up to roughly where broadcast TV was in 1923 . " A major problem is the huge amount of bandwidth , or frequency space , required compared with a standard six-megahertz TV channel . " We 're doing everything we can to get under five hundred megahertz , " Benton tells me . Such 3-D holographic TV signals would tax the capacity of even most optical fiber networks . Some fiber systems tested in labs , though , could easily handle such bandwidths 1 " Optical Fibers are Taking Over Telecommunications , " Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave a problem , according to Stephen Hines . " The state of the art is , " says Hines , " when you project a hologram on a screen , you 're back to a flat picture . That 's not acceptable . " Holographic-TV watchers might have to use some type of direct-viewing device , as with Victorian stereoscopes . As researchers such as Collender pursue the Holy Grail of 3-D technology ? autostereoscopic viewing ? steady enhancements to all imaging techniques are contributing to morerealistic pictures . Says Stephen Hines : " One by one things have improved : film has a tighter grain ; we 've moved to color ; video and resolution is still improving ; and now pictures are starting to appear in 3-D . "
