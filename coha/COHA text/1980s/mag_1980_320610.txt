And the " brazenfaced mullahs " consolidate their power <P> I am Imam Khomeini 's follower , the parliament 's child and Banisadr 's brother . " With that modest assessment of his qualifications , Mohammed Ali Raja'i last week accepted his election as Iran 's Prime Minister . Raja'i , as Winston Churchill said about another man , has every reason to be modest . His meager government experience was limited to a ten-month stint as Minister of Education , a post in which he mainly presided over the closing of schools and universities in the name of " Islamization . " President Abolhassan Banisadr , who is constitutionally responsible for nominating the Prime Minister , considered Raja'i headstrong , ill-informed and unfit for the job . In fact , the 47-year-old former mathematics teacher seemed to have had only one thing going for him : a fanatical attachment to the Islamic fundamentalism of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini . <P> Nonetheless , that was enough to recommend Raja'i to members of the clergy-controlled Islamic Republic Party , which dominates Iran 's parliament , the Majlis . That body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 24 , with 19 abstentions . Banisadr had stated publicly that he considered Raja'i a bad choice . But he finally bowed to clerical pressures and nominated Raja'i at the " recommendation " of a parliamentary commission controlled by the I.R.P. Explained a senior civil servant : " Khomeini was becoming impatient . It was obvious that the more brazen-faced mullahs would win . " <P> Perhaps the most brazen of all the mullahs , Ayatullah Seyyed Mohammed Beheshti , thus consolidated his party 's power and made good on a seven-month-old vow to reduce the popularly elected President to a figurehead . Even Banisadr 's attempt to retain his constitutional veto rights over Cabinet appointments was rudely quashed by the mullahs . " The Prime Minister , " insisted Beheshti , " must be free to choose anyone he deems fit for Cabinet positions . " <P> Raja'i is unlikely to be much more than a front man for Beheshti and his clerical allies . The new Prime Minister is unimposing in person ; he has no popular following and little apparent political savvy . Critics say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arrested for distributing antigovernment literature in 1974 , Raja'i is said by fellow inmates to have begged for mercy when tortured by SAVAK , the Shah 's secret police . " His behavior at the time was certainly not heroic , " notes one former prisoner . Students in his math classes at the Kamal Islamic high school in Tehran describe Raja'i as " inflexible " and " humorless , " qualities that he appears to have brought with him into political life . He showed an awesome highhandedness as Minister of Education , for example , by disbanding the entire provincial school system in the rebellious western region of Kurdistan and firing 12,000 teachers . His reason : Communists had allegedly infiltrated the schools .
