Hoping to provoke a little candor among the six Republican presidential candidates on his television show , William F. Buckley Jr . asked Pierre du Pont why he would be a better choice than Jack Kemp . As du Pont began to answer with practiced evasion , Bob Dole broke in : " You 're looking at me . Kemp 's over there . " " Yeah , " replied du Pont evenly , " but the camera 's behind you . " Television , once the terror of politicians because it revealed character , now merely shows their carefully fashioned synthetic facades . <P> More than ever in the age of Ronald Reagan , television smarts are required job skills for presidential candidates . The Republicans , like the Democratic candidates a few weeks earlier , were articulate , amiable , pat , well coached and sincere as all get-out . It should have been more impressive . Hubert Humphrey or Dwight Eisenhower or Lyndon Johnson would never have been able to compact his message into two minutes  --  each was a rambler  --  but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the chief criterion , two preachers such as Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson , who have never drafted legislation , governed a state or even served on a city council , seem just as qualified for the presidency as those who have . <P> This equalizing effect occurs because television most rewards not words or achievements but coronas of personality . Ted Koppel often seems more knowledgeable than the experts he questions , and George Will triumphantly bolder than Cabinet members who , unlike him , must bear policy responsibility for what they say . It took another corona of personality , Ronald Reagan , to reduce the dominance of the Washington scene by television journalists . He did it , this experienced actor , by disdaining the press and carefully controlling his public appearances . And he did it negatively by subjecting reporters to the humiliation of shouting questions over the helicopter 's roar . Artificial as these tactics were , they helped him sustain the popularity essential to any ! effective presidency . But the trick has worn out , as do all long-running television acts . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liners shouted over the rotor blades , it was not Sam Donaldson but Ronald Reagan who looked inadequate . <P> Washington figures can be divided into those who have and those who have not developed the impervious veneer required by television  --  that ability to duck an awkward question by talking about something else , the talent to pat-a- cake thoughts into little mouthfuls suitable for stopwatch programming . Of all the Senators and Congressmen on exhibit in recent televised hearings , Teddy Kennedy has the most undentable carapace . Many who watched the Bork hearings concluded that Kennedy and Utah 's sycophantic Orrin Hatch vied in giving the worst performances . Yet Kennedy dominated the evening news coverage by crafting his wild charges into the little sound bites so dear to news producers . <P> Those who watched the Iran and Bork hearings were reminded of how inadequate a capsule summary can be if you 've seen the movie . Less familiar committee members  --  Inouye , Hamilton , Mitchell , Specter , Simpson  --  appealed just because their humanity had n't vanished behind a professional veneer . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly human , and a welcome change from the usual Washington sound-bite sophisticate.
