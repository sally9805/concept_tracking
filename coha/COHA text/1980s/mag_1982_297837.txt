The Playboy hutch gets wired for a new cable show <P> The blond host sits on a windowsill , smiling into a filtered lens . An apple is in one hand , a hair dryer in the other . Dress is informal ; in fact , it is nonexistent . Introductions are made . The host is : a ) Diane Sawyer , co-host of CBS 's Morning show , making an all-out bid to win the war of the a.m. news programs ; b ) ABC 's David Hartman , doing the same ; or c ) Lassie , doing what comes naturally . <P> The answer is none of the above . The correct response : Shannon Tweed , the November 1981 Playboy centerfold , inviting viewers to join her in Hugh Hefner 's new electronic rabbit warren . In partnership with Escapade , a cable programmer that bills itself as an " adult entertainment service , " Playboy last month launched the first in a series of one-hour video magazines into 200,000 homes . " The cable market is similar to the opportunities the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is where home entertainment is going . It 's a core interest for us . " <P> Make that soft core . " We know we have a special marketplace , " says Playboy Productions President Russell Barry . " It 's not a marketplace for porn or for Disney . It 's for people who would like a sophisticated , adult , sometimes sexy service . " Jerry Maglio , president of Escapade 's parent company , agrees . " Playboy has worked very hard at developing its image and standing for quality , " he says . " That image , over 27 years , has been established in a very positive way . " It also has had a salutary effect on Escapade . Before the Playboy partnership , Escapade was available on some 100 cable systems . Now that Hef has come onboard , Maglio is expecting to attract an additional 115 cable outlets by June . <P> The first video incarnation of Playboy was , Hefner says , intended as " a sampier-the show is still evolving . " In defiance of all McLuhanish precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that seemed to be jettisoned from the first show were the subscription card and " Little Annie Fannie . " Playboy maybe , as Hefner says , " a very visual magazine , " but a new medium changes the visuals and demands alterations in format . TV Playboy is sticking close to home . <P> The first show opens with a Playboy interview : John Derek and Bo Derek atop a California hill that is only slightly less windswept than the Dereks ' conversation . After a promo by Playmate Tweed en deshabille and a parody commercial , the program rips through a " Ribald Classic , " stages a centerfold photo session on Shannon and tosses in a humorous feature on Andy Kaufman , male chauvinist champ presumptive , wrestling Playmate Susan Smith to the mat in a " primal battle of the sexes .
