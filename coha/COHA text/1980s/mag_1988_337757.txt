Not far from the creek named Scorched Lime in the northern slums of Manila lies a settlement called Happy Land . The name notwithstanding , Happy Land is neither happy nor on land . A collection of lean-tos patched together from plastic , cardboard , plywood and scrap metal , Happy Land is built on stilts above the black waters of a sewage canal . Flies buzz around empty tin cans and wastepaper in the water below , as Happy Landers catwalk across the planks that lead from shack to shack . Inside cramped quarters , men play cards or sleep on chairs padded with rags ; women boil rice on mottled clay stoves . Everywhere children frolic , playing tag and splashing around where the stream empties into Manila Bay . <P> Less than ten miles to the south , in the suburb of Paranaque , stand the stately mansions of the Plazas of Dignity . It is a serene place , which should come as no surprise , since all the residents are dead . The plazas are part of Manila Memorial Park , a cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband Benigno , assassinated in 1983 , rests in a simple tomb , other graves are grandiose : white sepulchers within marble pavilions , furnished with altars and windowed with stained glass . Some even provide bathrooms and beds for mourners . <P> Filipinos celebrated the second anniversary last month of the uprising they call the People Power revolution . But little of a revolutionary nature has occurred in the two years since the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos . Even as more parkland is being cleared for the well-heeled dead , life continues to balance on stilts over the brackish waters of Happy Land , a place of aching poverty and little hope . <P> Aquino has even struck an accommodating tone toward Marcos , who dearly wishes to return to the Philippines from his exile in Hawaii and has stopped threatening to overthrow the government . Several weeks ago , Aquino dispatched two of her relatives to meet with him . Last week she made it clear that before Marcos would be allowed to re-enter the country , he would have to return the billions of dollars he allegedly stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an imminent Marcos homecoming is unlikely , many Aquino supporters are chagrined by the President 's willingness to countenance her enemy 's return . Wrote Columnist Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc in the Philippine Daily Inquirer : " Has Cory Aquino been lured away . . . by the promise of dollars and cents ? Say it is n't so . " <P> Despite several coup attempts and continuing political uncertainty , Aquino remains ensconced in Malacanang Palace and has developed a firmer grip on power . Yet her supporters are not convinced that the President will be able to correct long-standing social inequities or steer the Philippines out of moral drift . " Merely staying in power without changing anything is retrogression in itself , " Historian Renato Constantino recently wrote in the Philippine Daily Globe . " Personal success is not synonymous with national success . "
