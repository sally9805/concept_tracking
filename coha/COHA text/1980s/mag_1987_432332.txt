 | This is what Prince did in the first two weeks of April : Spent three days in the studio with Bonnie Raitt . Consulted with Dale Bozzio , Sheila E. , Jill Jones and Tony LaMans about upcoming records on his label . Worked with Sheila E. on her new video . Watched his own new album , " Sign ' 0 ' The Times , " break onto the Billboard pop-album chart at No. 40 and climb to No.12 in its second week , headed for the top ( box ) . Kept an eye on morning rehearsals for Madhouse , his opening act , and worked with his own band in the afternoons . Oversaw finishing touches on Paisley Park , his new $10 million audio/video/film production facility in a Minneapolis suburb , right down to the logo on the business cards . Left for England to rehearse for a two-month European tour . " All he asks of you , " says Harry Grossman , project coordinator for Paisley Park Studios , " is that you keep up . " Grossman smiles thinly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 , already known as a musical wizard , Prince is becoming something bigger : an entertainment conglomerate . His reach is spreading via the new album , a hit single , the European tour , an American tour probably starting in July . But it is the new studio complex , a 65,000-square-foot postmodern behemoth , that promises to have the greatest effect ? not just on Prince himself , who can at last bring all his activities together under one roof , but on the whole creative community of Minneapolis , his hometown . There is a Hollywood-size sound stage in the place , two recording studios and rehearsal space , all of which will be available to outside clients ; plus office space for Prince 's record label and his umbrella company , PRN Productions . The new complex is " probably the only facility of its kind between the coasts , " says Alan Leeds , operations director of PRN . Says Grossman , " The concept is purely his . Prince wants this to be the best production facility in the world . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he ? In the nine years since his first album was released , bearing the soon-to-be-familiar label " Produced , arranged , composed and performed by Prince , " he has delivered on just about every brag . ( OK , so the movie " Under the Cherry Moon " was a flop . But a bravura flop . ) The sound track to " Purple Rain " sold 17 million copies worldwide . His subsequent albums have been less successful in the marketplace but no less ambitious . Minneapolis is to R &B; in the 1980s what Detroit was in the ' 60s , the home of a discrete and dominant sound ? and Prince is its progenitor . Last week eight records on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart bore his stamp , starting with his own " Sign O ' The Times " at No.1 , down through productions by his proteges Jimmy Jam &; Terry Lewis , Jesse Johnson and David Rivkin . Sheila E. 's " Hold Me " showed up recent : on the soft-rock Adult Contemporary chart ; under the pseudonym " Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer Deborah Allen . He 's everywhere . " You ca n't underestimate his influence , " says Eric Leeds , his saxophone player . " And as popular an artist as he is , his influence is that much deeper among musicians . Prince is the one that other musicians all want to check out . " Hard , fast work : His record label , also called Paisley Park , has been the main vehicle for Prince 's march across the charts . Prince has a hand in all the creative decisions at the label , and its philosophy , says Eric Leeds , is " very simple : alterna-  | tive music . New artists , or maybe artists you know in a new context . Everything a little bit different . " That would explain Prince 's desire to work with Raitt , a terrific singer who has never had the chart success she deserves . " He works real hard , real fast , kicks your butt , " Raitt said last week after three days in the basement studio at Prince 's suburban Minneapolis home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Prince played almost everything else , should be red-hot . " He wants to broaden my audience , " Raitt says . " He thinks I 've got something that is n't being heard , and he knows how to get it out there . " Alan Leeds , for one , is hopeful that the corporate idea behind Paisley Park Records will trickle down to clients of Paisley Park Studios : " We hope the environment will encourage people who work there to do things against the grain . " First things first , though . The immediate task is to get clients in the door . Paisley Park is a huge facility , two years on the drawing board : the sound stage alone measures 12,000 square feet ; the larger of its two recording studios , scheduled to open June 1 , is fitted out for every audio task up to film scoring . There is a rehearsal/dance hall with a sprung floor , underground parking for 15 cars , a humidity-controlled Mosler bank vault to store the 300-plus songs Prince has on tape , a backstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take a lot of billing to make the place pay , and there is , no doubt , self-interest in the management 's insistence that outsiders are welcome ? a new crack in the wall of mystery that has surrounded Prince up to now But there 's also a genuine sense that Paisley Park will be good for Prince 's hometown . A 1985 survey found that more than half the national TV ad : billed in the Twin Cities were shot out of town . " Production dollars leave this city , " Gross . man says . " Prince wants to keep them here . " A few week : ago Kool &; the Gang hired the sound stage for tour rehearsals " The hotel , the caterer , the lira ousine company all made more money than we did , " Grossman says . " We put together a 15. man crew . Clients are going to find that there 's a Midwestern work ethic here ? if we hire pea ple to work , they 're going to come in and work . They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote . " Purple dormer : " Paisley Park ie in your heart , " Prince sang in 1985 . Now Paisley Park is on the map , too , a huge white building with a purple dormer on the highway west of town . The people who work for Prince talk about the artists who will work there , the feature films that will be shot , the hit records that will be made ? maybe even a " Hollywood Palace " - style weekly variety show . Suddenly , in the cavernous sound stage , the PA system crackles on : " Atten ? tion K mart shoppers , " a voice says soberly . " Our Blue Light Special today . . . " Grossman , in the midst of a serious business pitch , cracks up . " Well , " he says , " it 's rock and roll , too . " Can it all work together ? Who knows ? Like everything Prince has ever done , the dream seems outsize and eccentric . But like everything Prince has ever done , it surely will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73
