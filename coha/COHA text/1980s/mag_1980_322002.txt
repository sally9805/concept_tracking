Bizarre kidnaping <P> In darkness and rain , the strapping teenager and the five-year-old boy hitchhiked the 40 miles from Manchester , near the California coast , to Ukiah , a mist-shrouded market town 120 miles north of San Francisco . Arriving at about midnight , Steven Stayner , 14 , hesitantly told police the reason for their trip . " I did n't want Timmy to go through what I went through . " <P> So ended one of the most bizarre kidnaping cases in California history . Timothy White , the five-year-old , had been abducted in Ukiah on Valentine 's Day , while on his way home from kindergarten . Police charged that he was taken by a drifter named Kenneth Parnell , 48 , who cropped the boy 's blond hair and dyed it a darker color , then brought him home to his one-room cabin near Manchester . The boy 's parents never received a ransom note . Parnell did not want money : he allegedly had stolen Timmy to provide a " brother " for Steve Stayner , whom authorities claim he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school in Merced , in central California . <P> Police say that Parnell convinced the young Stayner that he had been put under his custody by a court order . The boy tried to run away once , but got lost and returned . Stayner became known as Dennis Parnell and even began calling his kidnaper " Dad . " They ended up in the cabin without water or electricity on an isolated ranch near Manchester . Stayner attended local schools sporadically but led a solitary life . He later told the police : " It was boring . " Parnell worked as a night clerk at the Palace Hotel in Ukiah . " He was a quiet man who seemed a little lonely , " says Carol Lee , a coworker . " Kids-that 's what we talked about . " <P> Why did Parnell kidnap the boy ? Digging into his record , police found an unsavory history . At 19 , after a trial in which a court-appointed psychiatrist called him a " sexual psychopath , " Parnell was convicted of sexually abusing an eight-year-old boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the trial , Parnell 's wife-who later left him-had given birth to a girl . A court order prohibited Parnell from ever having any contact with her , a fact that Mendocino County District Attorney Joseph Allen speculates might have induced him to kidnap children as surrogates for his daughter . Parnell also served six years in Utah State Prison for armed robbery and grand larceny and twice escaped from mental institutions . <P> Despite Parnell 's past , police feel that he did not sexually molest Timmy White ; they are unlikely to prosecute Parnell for any sexual crimes involving Stayner , who insists that he was not mistreated . The boy clearly has conflicting thoughts about his captor . Police say that Stayner seemed fond of Parnell , who he said " spoiled " him . When Stayner finally left , he took along a dog named Queenie , a present from Parnell . Stayner was defensive about Parnell in his talks with police and reluctant at first to reveal his name . Yet Stayner also said that he had no desire to see him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
