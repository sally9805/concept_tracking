txt IT IS THE EIGHTH INNING of the seventh game of the 1979 World Series , and the Baltimore Orioles are threatening the Pittsburgh Pirates ' 2-1 lead . Mark Belanger , a pinch runner , Is on third ; Al Bumbry , a speedster , Is on second ; Ken Singleton is on first ; and the dangerous Eddie Murray Is facing the sunerlative Kent Tekulve . Two are out , and Pirate Manager Cnuck Tanner watches anxiously as the count reaches 2-and-2 . Now Tekulve offers again , and Murray , batting left-handed , lashes a liner toward right fielder Dave Parker . Parker spots the ball and begins to move toward it , but then he slips on the rain-soaked grass of Memorial Stadium . ( " Right then , I saw the whole year go by , " Tanner recalls . ) Then Parker steadies himself , slips again , steadies himself again , and finally makes the catch that ends the inning . " Someone else could have fallen down , but he was concentrating so much he made the catch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his attitude , he would n't be denied catching that ball . Now what do I see in that ? I see he wanted it so much that he could have fallen on his face and still have caught it . If there would have been a river there , he would have climbed over it and caught it . To many people , what he did was n't much . But to me , that 's when I knew we 'd win it . " An inning later the Pirates ' victory was a reality , and they rushed off the field and toward the locker room , the TV cameras , the cases of champagne , and the inevitable celebrating . Before they reveled , however , a large group of them ducked into a small back room to join Joe Brown , their former general manager ; and Chuck Tanner and one of his sons . " I have a gentleman here who 's a friend , " said catcher Manny SanguIllen , and there were only the sounds of silence . " THE PLAYERS would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ( who died during it ) , " the friend said , " and they 'd like to thank and praise God for giving them the opportunity to play . " " That was a time when everyone can be happy , but they took a moment to thank God , " Tanner recalls . " That was the most rewarding experience I 've ever had as long as I 've been in baseball . When I walked out of there I saw Joe Brown , and Joe Brown had a tear in his eye . There 's a guy who 's been in the game 40 years , and I know he 'll say he never saw anything like it in his life . " " Was winning the Series your greatest moment in baseball ? " Chuck Tanper 's then asked . " No question about it , " he says . " Not only was there the happiness of winning the World Series and being able to say that I managed a world champion , which only 46 guys can say . But there was also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things I stand for , the things I had to overcome to get to that point . It was really rewarding . " THE NEXT DAY Chuck Tanner burled his mother , but on the following afternoon he was again with his players at a public rally that honored them and that night he joined them at a private dinner , where they celebrated with their families . Then he returned home and began to uncoil . During the next 10 weeks , he often played 18 or 27 holes of golf a day , walking each one of them and shedding the mental pressures that had embraced him for so long . His last round was on a Sunday a month ago . Then he jumped onto the whirling merry-go-round that is both the reward and the curse of any world champion . There were trophies to collect , honors to receive , speeches to deliver , and Chuck Tanner began traveling throughout the country and sharing his smile , his optimism , and his philosophy with all who desired them . " It 's hard to find me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , " adds Pirate public relations director Joe Service , " I 've seen him twice . " " I 'd rather be at home with my family , " Tanner says . " But l feel when someone recognizes you , it 's part of your job to present yourself in the city that wants to honor you . " HE HAS JOURNEYED to Atlanta , Toronto , Kansas City , Las Vegas , and Chicago , yet the two affairs that have touched him most deeply were held in the tiny town of New Castle , Pa . Ile grew up there , and shortly after his triumph the town 's officials told him that they were going to honor him with a parade and a day . " Shoot , we do n't need that , " he thought when he heard the plans . But they would not relent , and so he soon contacted an old friend who lived some 50 miles away in Meadville . " When you win the World Series , " the friend had told Tanner some years ago , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my 1932 La Salle convertible . " " OK , " Tanner told him . " Come down and drive me . " On the afternoon of Oct. 27 , 60,000 people swelled the town of New Castle , population 38,000 . They had arrived from Pittsburgh and Beaver Falls , Youngstown and Niles , Greenville and Sharon , and all were arrayed in Pirate black and gold . Police would restrain them when Chuck Tanner , his wife , and his father passed by in the yellow La Salle , and the parade would last more than two hours . " It was something , " Tanner says . " ' they call Pittsburgh ' Someplace Special . ' New Castle , it 's ' The Right Place . ' " New Castle encored that festival with a dinner in the biggest building in town , and again it overflowed with those who wished to hear Chuck Tanner , see Chuck Tanner , and share the glory that had suddenly descended upon Chuck Tanner , the Favorite Son . " It lasted four hours and people were saying it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town like New Castle , having all these things happening , it was unbelievable . " It was their party , and man , they really enjoyed it . People here are the same as people In the Midwest . I 've always felt that way , I 've always considered it that way . They 're basic , hard-working people . They scrapped down for their 15 bucks ( for the dinner ) . What they had left over , they donated to the library . " CHUCK TANNER still lives three miles from his hometown , just over tyre hill from the Fall Track section in which he was raised . That was a tough place , tougher than Clifton Flats or Sheep Hill or Gardner 's Stop , a place with unpaved roads , gas lamps , and no indoor plumbing . His father worked in the tin mill and his mother tended the house , where a pot-bellied stove provided the heat and where he shared a bed with his younger brother Bill . " It was crazy , but we were happy , really happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes on our plate . " He was as mischievous as any child , but at 12 he discovered baseball , abandoned pranks , and began rustling home from school so he could hear the final innings of a Pirate game on the radio . That year he also joined his first baseball team  --  the Mooney Brothers Construction Company  --  and in his first official game of his life , he got five doubles off a 16-year-old pitcher named Beaney MeCallion . He made the all-star team that year and the next , but when he was 14 he started working at Fenatti 's Brick Playa and soon he noticed his production slipping . " I was only hitting about .490 or .500 , " he once recalled . " No kidding . I had been hitting about .600 or .700 . So I asked one of my friends what I was doing wrong and he told me I was working eight hours a day hacking brick , putting them in the oven , carrying ' em , squeezing ' em . I had n't even realized that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned down college scholarship offers and an offer to play professional basketball and signed a contract with the Boston Braves . In 1947 he was sent to their Owensboro , Ky. , team in the Class D Kitty League , and ( or the next eight years he struggled in the minors , performing in towns like Pawtucket , R.I. , // Eau Claire , Wis Denver . and Atlanta In Atlanta , Tanner first thought of managing , and soon he was following his own manager down to the bullpen so he could watch how the man worked with his pitchers He also began to analyze moves made during a game , and each evening he would return to his room and record his thoughts and observations on small scraps of paper " HE WAS A HIGHLY dedicated player .

Seattle . and Hawaii before Stu Holcomb hired him in September of 1970 to take over the depressed and depressing White Sox franchise " Sometimes you meet a guy and say ' That 's my man : " said Holcomb then the team 's general man ager " It was like that when I brought Ara , Parseg hien ) to coach football at Northwestern Ara was a ' boom guy and so is Tanner CHUCK TANNER was then ai and ablaze with an optimism . an enthusiasm and a bevy of ideas that were soon ridiculed and scorned He quelled the critics of his technical innovations by resurrecting the White Sox . yet from then even to the present his unbridled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accepted cynically . if at all " What are your rules " ' he was asked at his first press conference as the White Sox manager " 1 have 25 rules : he said ' There s one rule for each player and it 's whatever I say to them " " You 'll be in trouble .. he heard " This is the major leagues " " I believe in communication on an individual basis , - he says . thinking beck to that day and of the skeptics that still exist ' After a couple of years . other managers started talking the same way Now it 's obvious , but it was n't obvious back then They were saying , ' You got to be here Curfew You ca n't be in the hotel bar ' I just fell regimentation was done , and the days of the army style were gone People were n't raised that way but they got into baseball and were regimented " I had made up my mind that when I got to the major leagues , I 'd treat my players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated at home I 'd communicate with them . and if I had to slap them , I 'd slap them Everyone sat back and kinds smiled when I said that They were thinking , ' When some Chuck tanner appiauds another Point ; victory thing comes up that idea goes down the tubes II wo n't work with professionals itut it s waked and now everyone does it " I DID WHAT I thought was right 1 lived with my convictions . though they were against tradition 1 was a pioneer as far as changing This is what I really believed in and I was n't afraid to do it They always talked about managers being hired to be fired I said that s a bunch of baloney My thoughts when I came tutu the big leagues were that I ni here as long as I want to be If you do n't want me. then I 'll go someplace else and make them better " To feel that way . you have to have a lot of confidence in yourself and I do If you try to satisfy everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re people around you who ca n't believe you 're the way you are They just do n't believe you They ca n't believe someone can be happy doing it their way But you ca n't deviate You have to stay with your principles , which I 've done throughout my career So succeeding gives me great satisfaction I felt my way was the direction to go . and 1 was n't afraid to stay with my way -I hug em and I kick ' em . but I never let a player leave without letting him know I would n't pay atten lion to him if I did n't care for him I care about you If I care about you , you ca n't let me down I try to shim my Minty I care about them I try to show my boys I care about them The same with my team They 're my family It comes back with a big circle We truly are family The biggest lift I had . the reason I was able to go through everything . was my players Everyone 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy to lose the nicest person in the world But my team . my team was faintly and got me through " WE ARE FAMILY " was the theme song of that 1979 Pittsburgh Pirate team . and next week Chuck Tanner will rejoin that family in spring training and begin his 10th season as a major-league manager He is at the apex now , a world champion yet he is still the little boy scrambling to escape the hard.serabble existence of Fall Track . still the young man stead lastly struggling toward a career in the majors still the rookie manager preaching the virtues of love and happiness to a cynical world In a room in his home near New Castle are testaments to the chords struck by this man and his team A series of boxes is there and in those boxes are letters , and in those letters are words of - praise from many in the audience that watched his players succeed last fall " There 're thousands of them . - Chuck Tanner says " Not hundreds . thousands and they ' say we helped the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what the world 's all about Some people do n't believe me but I 'm always going to do my own thing Everybody said it could n't work but I did n't care .
