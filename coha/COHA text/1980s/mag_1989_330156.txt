The headline over a recent editorial in the New York Times proclaimed , THE COLD WAR IS OVER . President Bush has rightly taken issue with that statement . But as the " spirit of Malta " washes over the West , he may soon find that he is a very lonely member of a virtually silent minority . On all sides we hear that Western ideas have won and that Communism has been defeated . And yet a Communist named Gorbachev is the most popular man in Europe . <P> Let us take a close look at this new international superstar . As a Communist he is publicly dedicated not to renouncing Marxism , like millions of demonstrators in Eastern Europe , but to rejuvenating it . He is a proud Russian nationalist . He likes power , knows how to use it and wants to keep it . His political reforms , glasnost , are totally inadequate compared with a free society . But compared with what the Soviet people had before , the changes are breathtaking . His economic reforms , perestroika , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Deng Xiaoping 's economic reforms , the per capita income of the Chinese people has doubled . In the five years of Gorbachev 's rule , the per capita income of the Russian people has gone down . But while Gorbachev has only marginally changed the Soviet Union , he has profoundly changed the world , simply by saying what many in the West want to hear after generations of Soviet intransigence . <P> Rather than just applauding what he has done , let us examine why . When Gorbachev came to power he found he was presiding over a military superpower and a Third World economic power . His clients in Cuba , Viet Nam , Ethiopia , Angola and Nicaragua required huge subsidies . Afghanistan was costing lives as well as money . In Eastern Europe the explosive forces of dissent were building dangerously . The stagnant Soviet economy was falling further and further behind the West . Gorbachev 's only option was to reform at home and retrench abroad . <P> * For two years , he temporized , trying to get a bad system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This policy failed , so he adopted bolder reforms . His purpose was not to abandon Communism but to save it . Ironically , by doing so he has become the darling of Western intellectuals and pundits . <P> As we would with any other master politician , we should look at Gorbachev 's deeds as well as his words . One example is Soviet military power . He still spends 20% of his gross national product on defense , compared with 6% in the U.S. He has modernized all three legs of the Soviet strategic nuclear triad . Soviet superiority in tanks , chemical weapons and combat aircraft has been maintained and in some cases increased . The Soviet Union 's military might is greater now than when Gorbachev came to power . Even if he has been sounding to some hopeful ears like a dove , his bristling talons still make him look like a hawk .
