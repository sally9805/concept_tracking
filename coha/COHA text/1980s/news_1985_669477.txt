Those are the skills of a master glassblower - hard-earned skills , as Mr. Pearce will attest . The path that led from a family pottery business in Ireland to a prosperous glassmaking factory and store in this tiny Vermont resort town was an arduous one. // // It began sometime in the mid-1960s . The lanky , sandy-haired young Irishman had apprenticed as a potter and had intended to pursue that craft , like his father before him . But a moment ' s reflection brought a change in course. // ' ' I suddenly realized I was collecting early glass , ' ' he recalls . Some of it was 150 years old and more - ' ' pub glass , ' ' used in taverns . ' ' I hadn ' t thought about it , ' ' he continues , ' ' but I found that I liked the old glass . I liked its individuality and character . ' ' Every piece , of course , had been handmade under the watchful eyes of a single craftsman. // ' ' I realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that same individuality , ' ' he says . ' ' All the other traditional crafts had been revived , but nobody was making glass . ' ' Then and there , he made a vow : ' ' I ' m 21 , let ' s see if it ' s possible ! ' ' // Thus commenced six months of frantic letter writing to glass manufacturers all over Europe , asking about apprenticeship possibilities . No reply . The industry , says Pearce with a wry smile , was still ' ' secretive , medieval . ' ' After a short - and unproductive , he says - stint in the Royal College of Art in London , the determined young man traveled to Amsterdam , where he finally hit upon the secret to getting into a glass factory : ' ' Arrive on their doorstep ' ' and be willing to do anything . He spent two years in a Dutch factory doing just that , sweeping up and observing . The next stop : Scandinavia , where the attitude of glassmakers toward someone hungering for knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' he says . ' ' That ' s where I really learned the trade. ' ' // Pearce returned to Ireland and by 1971 had set up a small factory ' ' between Cork and Dublin and Kilkenny . ' ' The learning process - both glassmaking skills and business skills - went on. // In 1975 , the glassmaker took his first trip to the United States . Traveling through upper New York State and New England , ' ' the first thing I noticed , ' ' he remembers , ' ' were all the old mills on rivers - all that wasted energy . ' ' That stuck in his mind , and the idea of a hydropower glass factory began to simmer. // On a return trip here , Pearce combed New York State for a site that combined good hydroelectric potential , a good business environment , and pleasant surroundings . He inspected 50 places , but only after arriving back in Ireland did he learn , through friends and friends of friends on both sides of the Atlantic , about the Quechee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped , but the combination of desirable features was ' ' unbelievable . ' ' After some quick business with a local bank - the property was on the verge // of being sold to a group of Boston investors - the Irish glassblower and his wife had their old mill in New England. // Five years , thousands of investment dollars , and two children later , the Simon Pearce establishment on the Ottauquechee River sparkles with success . Branch retail outlets have opened in Keene , N.H. , and Cambridge , Mass. , and a third outlying store is scheduled to open in New York City in late September . Pearce employs 50 people and last year sold just over $1 million worth of glassware , plus pottery and some imported Irish woolens. // But the operation has its rough spots , too . Pearce sunk thousands of dollars into revamping the mill ' s hydro capacities to accommodate a 400-kilowatt turbine purchased from a town utility in Canada . The plan , which worked fine for a while , was to generate income by selling power to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity needed to run the glass furnaces . However , the state board that sets power rates has substantially reduced the amount Pearce can get for his electricity , while the price he pays to get some back has risen . ' ' If that continues , I don ' t know what we will do , ' ' he says . He ' s reluctantly contemplating some lobbying trips to the state capital. // Then there ' s a need to rebuild a furnace damaged in a recent fire . The electrodes that superheat the molten glass and help homogenize it cost $500 each , and 24 will be needed . It ' s ' ' incredibly expensive , ' ' confides the glassmaker , but the furnace has to be up and running before the holiday rush. // The ' ' limiting factor in working glass , ' ' says Pearce , ' ' is skilled people . ' ' He brought three experienced glassblowers with him from Ireland and now has five American apprentices working with them . Apprenticeship in his shop lasts between two and five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high percentage of firsts ' ' ( pieces that meet standards without needing to be redone ) , explains Pearce. // As he takes a visitor around the workshop floor , one level beneath the glass-bedecked retail area , the proprietor points to a master glassblower working with an apprentice . The older man has drawn a glob of molten silica out of the furnace with his long pipe and is blowing it into a small balloon . His assistant stands by to help with the final shaping of the glass . The stemware they ' re making , like most of the products here , is a two-man job . A pair working together averages 50 glasses a day. // Just how delicate and demanding is this work ? ' ' Glass is far , far harder than pottery , ' ' Pearce observes , warming to a subject close to his heart . ' ' Glass is 90 percent judgment . You can ' t touch the material ; you have to judge everything - how hot , how pliable. ' ' // Does he get much chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualized tableware he envisioned long ago ? ' ' I haven ' t for 18 months now , ' ' he says with a grimace . Administrative duties and expansion plans have eaten up his time . ' ' But I hope to get back to it soon. ' ' // He also hopes to soon set up a ' ' mini-museum ' ' to display those treasured bits of ' ' pub glass , ' ' reminders of past glassmakers ' artistry and instigators of a modern glassmaker ' s artistic pilgrimage. // // // //
