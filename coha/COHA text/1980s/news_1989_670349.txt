TULSA , Okla.  --  Williams Cos. has always been interested in getting from here to there . It started out building sidewalks . It built pipelines . Later , it bought pipelines and pumped petroleum . Along the way , it also got into fertilizers , gas and coal . Nothing glamorous , but staying down to earth it became , in 1986 , a $1. 9 billion business . That year , a bunch of pigs with rope on their tails marched through 1 , 000 miles of unused Williams pipe , and now the pipes are transmitting messages from here to there . Pipeline " pigs " are plastic balls just a bit smaller than a pipe ' s diameter . They are pushed along , squeezing out remnants of crude oil , gasoline or liquid fertilizer  --  whatever it was that last oozed through the system . The pigs that Williams turned loose pulled behind them sheaths of fiberoptic cable . Thus , pipes that once moved crude oil at three miles an hour would henceforth carry dots of information at the speed of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion telecommunications business  --  the fourth-largest purveyor of long-distance service in the country , competing with the likes of AT &; MCI and US Sprint . " They pulled off a neat trick , " says Jack Grubman , a PaineWebber securities analyst . Now , just as suddenly , the 81-year-old company is at another crossroads , facing a test that confronts many companies trying to break out of hard-hat industries : It must make the transition from tangibles to intangibles , from delivering products to selling services . In marketing , Williams has no special advantage . So it is hustling , ripping up everything from office carpets to corporate culture . Though stodgy pipeline operations still generate 90% of its volume , the company is spending heavily on what it sees as its future . Williams Telecommunications Group Inc. , a company division , now has 900 employees , about a quarter of Williams ' s total employment . Only about 10% of these people were already working for Williams , mostly as executives . " All our salespeople come from other companies , " says Dean Cary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one at Williams is looking back . " In five years , you ' ll see telecommunications clearly the largest part of our business , " predicts Joseph Williams , the company ' s chairman . Though the unit is a relative infant , it already makes money  --  $20 million last year . In contrast , Sprint , the industry ' s No. 3 company , has yet to do that well for a full year . Wall Street also seems to approve . Williams shares have risen in price about 25% , to $39. 125 , over the past two months . ( But that may have something to do with the fact that Carl Icahn , who has held about 4% of Williams for more than a year , is walking around with $2 billion to spend right now . ) " Our area of risk is in marketing , " acknowledges Mr. Williams . Roy Wilkens , the former pipeline executive who conceived the scheme and now heads Williams Telecommunications , agrees : " The biggest frustration that we ' ve had is getting away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just toying with telecommunications . " But then , even Mr. Wilkens was dubious about the scheme when he dreamed it up early in this decade . Mr. Williams had sent out an SOS for ideas  --  " conventional or unconventional . " Mr. Wilkens looked around . American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. was about to be broken up . Fiber optics that could carry far more data than regular phone lines were becoming practical . Williams had empty pipeline . Bingo ! It seemed to make sense , but he didn ' t know what kind of reaction to expect from Mr. Williams , the 56-year-old son of one of the firm ' s founders and an up-through-the-ranks pipeline builder . So Mr. Wilkens " softened up " Vernon Jones , the silver-haired company president . Which seems to have been a smart move . " Vernon tiptoed in and told me , ' This is a kooky idea , ' " recalls Mr. Williams . " With Vernon , I took it seriously . I might have thrown Roy out . " Williams started with a small , $30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed west , stringing cable in its own out-of-service pipelines and buying other pipe when it could . Where there was none , it bought 8 , 000 parcels of land and laid cable in the traditional manner , four feet underground . In 1987 , it acquired a company in the fiber-optic-cable business for $95 million plus stock so as to lengthen its north-south route , and this year it bought another concern for $365 million , giving it cable up and down the East Coast . Of course , Williams ' s operations remain tiny compared with the Big Three . AT &; has 26 , 000 miles of fiber-optic cable ; Williams has 11 , 000 . A Sprint spokesman tells a reporter inquiring about Williams : " You ' re the first one who has ever asked . " Williams doesn ' t market to residential customers and doesn ' t advertise on television . It leases lines to other long-distance outfits and " big pipes , " or private lines , to companies that run their own communications networks . That $5 billion market niche is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams says . Such fiber-optic networks have become lifelines for many companies . American Airlines , for example , budgets almost as much for communications as for fuel and airplanes . Private lines link its computer reservations network with travel agencies , 14 " hub " sites across the country and parent AMR Corp. ' s computer center in Tulsa . Williams gets less than 10% of AMR ' s coveted volume  --  which illustrates one hard truth of the business . Most of it goes to giant AT &; because it " has provided us good service over the years , " says an AMR communications manager . That ' s undoubtedly true . But , as Williams salespeople are fond of saying , " Nobody ever got fired for choosing AT &; Says Mr. Wilkens : " If AT &; system goes down , it ' s an act of God . If our system goes down , it ' s a mistake . " Williams markets its cable-in-the-pipeline trick heavily because a broken fiber-optic line , carrying far more data than a regular phone line does , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Midwest to the West Coast is the only one in the industry never to have been cut . Even Williams cable laid alongside working pipelines is more secure than rivals ' lines , Mr. Wilkens says , because " Danger " signs posted on the right of way tend to keep vandals and builders away . Also , Williams continues its old gas-pipeline practice of regularly patrolling its line . In risky areas , such as a 40-mile stretch around Los Angeles , employees walk sections of the line every two hours . The giants nevertheless have been chipping away at Williams . With recent Williams acquisitions , they note , more than half of Williams ' s cable is just like theirs . Williams once also could claim speed as a selling point ; indeed , just a few years ago , AT &; sometimes needed 18 months to set up a customer ' s lines . Now it ' s just a month , contends AT &; and time is " no longer an issue . " " Price is No. 1 " today , declares Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals . Many customers agree . " It ' s a commodity service , " says Rod Baxter , who helps manage Mitchell Energy &; Development Corp. ' s communications . " And we ' re very cost-conscious . " He keeps a mental list of carriers he views as virtually interchangeable , and last month switched one of four lines from Williams to a smaller competitor , primarily for price reasons . Williams once was able to undercut AT &; prices by 30% to 40% , but as industry capacity increases , prices are falling . Now Williams makes more-modest claims , closer to a 10% price advantage . As it revs up its selling efforts , however , that is useful enough  --  particularly in the Southwest and Midwest . " The best markets we can deal in are in financial distress , " where price means the most , Mr. Wilkens says . One big Houston customer is recently bailed-out First City Bancorp. of Texas . ( Cut-rate prices , on the other hand , flopped with certain unnamed rich California companies , Mr. Wilkens says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities . " ) Williams salespeople are aggressive . In the Southeast , " We do a lot of presentations for people who have never heard of us , " says Mr. Cary , the marketing official . In Houston , Mary Goudreault , a Williams account manager , recently beat out AT &; MCI , Sprint and a company called Cable &; Wireless for the Texas account of Coca-Cola Enterprises . " It took me six months to get that contract , " she says . How did she prevail ? Answer : " Knock out the competition one at a time " by carefully matching what the customer has said it needs . Security was big with Coca-Cola , for example . Its automated system tells Atlanta headquarters what Texas supermarkets are selling and sends back instructions on how many cases of what soft drink to hoist onto delivery trucks . " If the line goes down , they can ' t get their trucks loaded , " Ms. Goudreault says . Coke won ' t abide communications failures . Now she is working on Texaco . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other contracts . " Texaco wasn ' t going to talk to us until we had credibility , " she says . To find this kind of dogged sales force , Williams goes outside the ranks of its pipeliners , who are still having trouble adapting to rapid change in the natural-gas business . " We lure them away from our competition , " says Mr. Cary , who came with LDX Net Inc. , acquired by Williams in 1987 . Ms. Goudreault was at LDX and before that was a sales rep for Alka-Seltzer . A Houston colleague used to sell Mary Kay cosmetics . Some customers came along with firms Williams acquired and then stayed . Amoco Corp. , one of Williams ' s biggest customers , could have pulled out of its contract with LDX when Williams came in , but " we ' ve had no reason to leave , " says K. Bruce Fingerly , Amoco ' s telecommunications network manager . Williams woos big potential customers with a guided tour of its high-tech Tulsa national control center . There , three giant TV screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Six-inch-high blue neon lights across the front demand " Zero Tolerance , " a promise of perfectionism . The equipment is impressive . Sitting at a large computer screen , senior technician Todd Shildt contrives a problem . A thousand miles of cable on the network map goes red . He moves a computer " mouse " to the line and hits a button . The screen shows a smaller part of the red line . Successive maneuvers isolate one circuit at a certain " regen " station . These are facilities that regenerate signals in the cable every 22 miles or so . But marketing , not hypothetical problem solving , is " 80% of it , " says one official , touting the art of salesmanship . " We probably average three tours a day , " says another . That is why an interior designer coordinated everything from the layout of the control center to the beige , blue , purple and aqua file cabinets . All in all , it ' s a far cry from what pipeline customers see and company employees endure elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carpet somewhere between maroon and orange . To clinch deals , Williams salespeople take customers to the teleconference center , a board room with a full-time demonstration TV hookup with Williams ' s St. Louis operation . Officials say the " close rate " on a sale is 90% once customers get the full on-location treatment , compared with 15% to 20% in the field . It isn ' t that they need or want the ability to teleconference , says Mr. Wilkens .
