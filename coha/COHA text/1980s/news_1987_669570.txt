This man in his early 30s , whose intensity mingles happily with the self-aware charm of someone who could easily model in cologne commercials , is the son of Arturo Cruz Sr. , the moderate Nicaraguan rebel leader who has just made headlines by breaking away from the United States-sponsored contra leadership. // The younger Cruz has made headlines himself - as a former boyfriend of Oliver North ' s secretary , Fawn Hall . Among the Washington elite who make and debate US foreign policy , he enjoys a different kind of reputation . Mr. Cruz is ' ' the most articulate and well-informed spokesman of the moderate viewpoint within the contra movement , ' ' says Robert Leiken , a Latin America specialist at the Carnegie Endowment. // // ' ' Arturito has had an enormous impact in Washington on intellectuals and politicians in both Congress and the administration . . . , Mr. Leiken says . ' ' He was unquestionably the leading ideologist and one of the leading protagonists in the effort to reform , modernize , and democratize the contras. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and hopes to reform the movement grow even dimmer - Cruz ' s greatest significance may be symbolic . <> <> Woes of the best and brightest // To understand Cruz ' s dilemmas might be to comprehend better a key segment of Nicaraguan university-educated youth , both in the country and in exile . These young people , Nicaragua ' s best and brightest , feel increasingly lost , caught between the ruling Sandinistas and the contras . In Nicaragua or Miami , their ability to influence political events , gain access to power , disseminate ideas in the news media , or even secure a professional job usually means a tough choice between one side or the other. // Now Cruz is leaving his job as adviser to the contras ' human rights office in Honduras , and will finish his doctorate at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. // As he lay back in the living room of a New York apartment , Cruz focused on the contras : ' ' Aside from the problem of the ex-Somocistas and conservative oligarchy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another fundamental dilemma. // ' ' Most of the contra leadership thought like old-line politicians dependent on the US and not like the leaders of the national insurrection . In the final analysis , they thought that their military problems would and could only be resolved by the US , by a massive US military intervention , led by their savior Ronald Reagan. ' ' // With this as a premise , Cruz says , ' ' the main object of their efforts became not leading an insurrection , but jockeying for political power among themselves , trying to position themselves so that they would emerge on top after US troops led them into Managua. ' ' // This is a Nicaraguan problem , the legacy of 44 years of Somoza dictatorship and seven years of the Sandinistas , he says. // ' ' We have very few true national leaders , but rather , back-room politicians squabbling over the pieces of cake handed out to them by the dictators , and finally , dependent on a great outside power. ' ' // Whoever emerges as new leaders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have to understand that the situation has radically changed , and that the US can provide no magic solutions , Cruz says. // The Iran-contra affair has weakened the US administration . Furthermore , the contra leadership has never understood US society. // ' ' This society came out of Vietnam profoundly tired and with strong isolationist tendencies , ' ' Cruz says . ' ' It ' s a society that doesn ' t want to take up its responsibilities as a great power . But paradoxically , it has an elite which thinks that this country can not be shaken . It believes US hegemony can survive Watergate , Irangate , Vietnam. . . . ' ' // Cruz says one of the US ' s main problems is its inability to build a lasting consensus that can support a consistent foreign policy . This is the flaw behind the Democrats ' idea that they can negotiate an agreement with Nicaragua to keep Soviet and Cuban influence out of Nicaragua without changes in the Sandinista leadership , Cruz says . To hold the naturally pro-Soviet and expansionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent effort by the US . It would require years and years of a consistent policy that would survive administration changes and shifts in US public opinion . It would also mean the ability to back up the US position by an invasion if the Soviet bloc was not kept out . Cruz says US society is not capable of this. // Cruz says the Sandinistas will , by definition , be expansionist and militaristic in the region and try to bait the US . Cruz worked for the Sandinistas at the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington and at the Sandinista party ' s International Affairs Department . The Sandinistas have an unworkable economic policy , Cruz says . Thus , their power will always be based on a large military apparatus which , by nature and Marxist-Leninist ideology , will push for expansion in the area . <> <> Sandinistas need a bogus enemy // Furthermore , Cruz says , to survive politically , the Sandinistas need a bogus enemy . For Cruz , the reasons for the Sandinista economic failure go beyond the usual inefficiencies of socialist central planning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America in the 1970s , he says . Modernization and some economic success created societies that were no longer the simple poor-peasant and rich-landowner countries of the revolutionary models. // Today , Cruz says , there is not only a professional middle class , but also a large number of small merchants and wholesalers who were once without property in Central America . There are also many peasants with small properties. // ' ' These people , ' ' Cruz says , ' ' are not just a small part of the population which can simply be shipped off to Miami . They represent substantial , and some of the most productive , segments of the population . In order to have a productive economy . . . they must be given some political power . Real democracy is the only form of government which could produce a workable economy and a real social compact in Nicaragua . Without it , we will simply have economic misery and endless political and military confrontations. ' ' // Cruz says the Sandinista system could survive and extend itself throughout Central America even without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba and Nicaragua have been successful in keeping social control with a combination of strong-arm tactics and forced mobilization of large segments of the population . <> <> Cruz still has hopes for the contras // He has not given up all hope for his movement . He talks of growing discontent in Nicaragua . He still believes in the potential of the contras ' using a long-term guerrilla strategy to force the Sandinistas to come to ' ' a national understanding . ' ' But he fears that without US congressional aid , whatever remains of the contras will survive only on grants from the international extreme right , and thus be rendered more marginal. // What will become of Arturo Cruz Jr . ? Will he continue to fight ? If so , with whom ? Does he have any real options ? Or will he do what so many of the children of the economic elite in Central America have traditionally done ? After a turbulent youth , when an often dangerous political career is intermixed with passionate and multiple romances , the standard pattern is to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just another yuppie ? // ' ' The one thing I know I want to do is finish my doctorate and write a book about the deeper meanings of what has happened in Nicaragua . I want to continue struggling , but I ' m pessimistic . This is difficult , because you get older , and the older you get , you begin to think selfishly and ask yourself : ' What will I do with the rest of my life ? ' When I compare my life with the American students I went to school with and I see them with established careers , I wonder whether personally I haven ' t been paying too high a price for what I have been doing for the last 10 years . I ask myself what will dominate my life for the next five or 10 years , my personal concerns or my political struggle ? I still don ' t know. ' ' // //
