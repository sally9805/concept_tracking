Hours later , the economic adviser , Sir Alan Walters , also resigned , but without giving any public explanation . Mrs. Thatcher replaced Mr. Lawson with the man she had made Foreign Secretary only three months ago , John Major . The new Foreign Secretary is Douglas Hurd , previously the Home Secretary. // The evening ' s events left British monetary and economic policy in confusion and Mrs. Thatcher in the most serious political crisis of her 10 years as Prime Minister . She is under the heaviest criticism since Michael Heseltine resigned as her Defense Minister in January 1986 . Mr. Lawson had been Chancellor since 1983. // // Accused of Autocracy // Admiration for her ability to denounce Britain ' s and her own detractors has turned , in many minds , to a feeling that she has become arrogant and autocratic , publicly humiliating her ministers and driving them out of the Government if they stand up to her. // Accepting her Chancellor ' s resignation , Mrs. Thatcher pointedly wrote , " It is a matter of particular regret that you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been relying on Mr. Lawson to bring Britain ' s 7. 6 percent rate of inflation under control before the next general election , not expected until 1991 at the earliest . Mr. Lawson , who had been involved in a dispute with Sir Alan , quit apparently because he had decided that Mrs. Thatcher ' s defense of him had not been sufficient. // She had dismissed Sir Geoffrey Howe as Foreign Secretary in July , after he sided with Mr. Lawson at a European Community summit meeting and urged her to say when Britain would tie the pound more formally to the West German mark and other European currencies in the European Monetary System . Britain is the last of the major industrial nations in the Community that has not yet joined the system. // But she kept Mr. Lawson on then , to preserve confidence in the Government ' s anti-inflationary policy. // Mr. Lawson raised the British basic interest rate from 7 percent to 15 percent over the last 16 months , despite the pain that caused to small businesses and homeowners holding variable-rate mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mrs. Thatcher and Sir Alan would not let him do anything else , according to senior British officials . Several political commentators said tonight that Mr. Lawson had finally gotten fed up. // Mr. Lawson ' s only public explanation tonight for his abrupt resignation was in a letter to Mrs. Thatcher. // " The successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is - and is seen to be - full agreement between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer , " he wrote . " Recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement can not be satisfied so long as Alan Walters remains your personal economic adviser . I have therefore regretfully concluded that it is in the best interests of the Government for me to resign my office without further ado . " <> <> She Expresses ' Profound Regret ' // Mrs. Thatcher , in her reply , did not address his concerns about Sir Alan but said that it was " with the most profound regret " that she received his letter and had been unable to talk him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said there was no difference in their basic economic beliefs , a remark clearly aimed at the financial markets , where the pound has been wobbly in recent weeks. // Mr. Lawson ' s resignation immediately sent the British pound down sharply in London and then in New York . Traders said several central banks , including the Federal Reserve Bank in New York , had intervened to support the pound by buying it with dollars. // When the resignation headline flashed across traders ' screens in New York , the pound was trading around $1. 6025 . It quickly dropped below $1. 60 and ended the day at $1. 5780 , down almost four cents from Wednesday ' s $1. 6143 . It did not recover on the announcement of Mr. Major as Mr. Lawson ' s replacement and is expected to remain under pressure until the course of economic policy under the new Chancellor is clearer. // Economists were divided about what Mr. Lawson ' s departure and replacement by Mr. Major would mean for the British economy , which many of them believe is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unwilling to push interest rates higher and will be more willing to cut rates if there is evidence of a further weakening in economic growth , " said Malcolm Roberts , an economist at Salomon Brothers in London. // George A. Magnus , chief international economist at Warburg Securities , said , " Some people will think the Government ' s anti-inflation resolve will be weakened by Lawson ' s departure . " <> <> Shunning Europe ' s System // But economists were united in the belief that the new Chancellor would be firmly resolved not to let Britain join the European monetary system , despite the prospect of a $32 billion trade deficit this year , caused in part by Mr. Lawson ' s decision after the stock market crash of October 1987 to increase liquidity . That set off an import-buying spree instead. // Mr. Major , a junior minister in the Treasury before Mrs. Thatcher plucked him out last July to become Foreign Secretary after the last Cabinet reshuffle , returned to his old office tonight .

The Government ' s credibility is shot. " // The dispute between Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan had been simmering since the end of last year , when Sir Alan returned to Downing Street , where he had served as an adviser from 1980 to 1983 . Sir Alan is a strict monetarist who has said he does not believe in artificially tying the value of the pound to other currencies. // Many therefore thought that they saw his hand in public remarks Mrs. Thatcher made last spring that seemed to blame Mr. Lawson for setting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound to the West German mark. // This fall , The Financial Times published excerpts from an autobiographical article Sir Alan wrote last year , before he returned to Downing Street , for The American Economist magazine . <> <> Article Seen as Last Straw // Describing the European exchange rate mechanism - the first step towards the common currency that so many European leaders say they want - he wrote that so far , Mrs. Thatcher had taken his advice and stayed out of it .
