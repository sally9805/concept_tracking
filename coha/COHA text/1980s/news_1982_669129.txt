That number is , of course , tiny compared with the sales of General Motors , Ford , or even Chrysler . Nonetheless , Peugeot ' s sales manager here , Victor Dial - an American with a top job in a decidedly French company - was happy. // ' ' By and large , ' ' he says , ' ' we have the correct sales strategy. ' ' // Peugeot hired Mr. Dial a year ago from Ford , for which he had worked for 20 years in France , England , and Belgium . Peugeot had grown from what Dial called ' ' a small , obscure manufacturer of cars ' ' with sales of around 7 billion francs in 1970 to the third- or fourth-largest automaker in the world , and by 1980 sales of some 75 billion francs ( more than $11 billion at today ' s exchange rates ) . By buying out Citroen in 1975 and Chrysler ' s European operation in 1978 , it acquired a host of plants scattered about Europe , new auto lines - and financial losses. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that Peugeot turned to outside help , ' ' Mr. Dial says. // Last year the Peugeot auto group posted a consolidated loss of more than 2 billion francs , or some $300 million . That loss was partly due to the costs of closing down plants . Among others , Peugeot has shut down a Chrysler plant in Linwood , Scotland , a Citroen factory in Belgium , and its manufacturing operations in Argentina . Another factor was high financing costs. // In an interview , Mr. Dial said 1982 will be ' ' much better ' ' for Peugeot than 1981 . The company should be ' ' fairly close ' ' to profitability on an operating basis . However , he added , the family-controlled company is ' ' not out of the woods yet ' ' in its absorption of the Chrysler plants. // ' ' We have the French operation pretty well turned around , ' ' Dial said . ' ' We are looking for big improvements over the next few years. ' ' // Peugeot ' s sales have picked up 13 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also somewhat higher in Italy and Britain , but are down a bit in West Germany . Plants are working overtime to meet orders. // In the US , Peugeot sales have been hit by the drop in gasoline prices and rise in diesel fuel prices . Mr. Dial admitted there is less financial justification now for buying a diesel-engine Peugeot than before . About half of Peugeot ' s sales last year were diesels. // ' ' I will be happy if we do as well ( in the US ) this year as we did last year , ' ' he said . His target is the sale of 20 , 000 cars. // Peugeot ' s sales strategy in the US has been to aim at the luxury price range . Its Peugeot 505 , 504 ( a station wagon ) , and 604 sell in the $11 , 000-to-$22 , 000 range , with an average sticker price of $15 , 000 to $16 , 000 . That ' s about half the cost of a Mercedes , but closer to the price of BMW or Volvo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mr. Dial said , for Peugeot to try to slug it out in the bottom of the US market with Volkswagen or Japanese imports . A high price and high quality , he argued , make more money for Peugeot and its 330 American dealers. // Dial is critical of the ' ' American way ' ' of selling cars , with rebate after rebate , now followed by warranty competition . He contends that Europeans , with their smaller , well-made cars , can today teach Americans something about selling automobiles. // Peugeot got its start in the 19th century as a maker of steel corset stays . By the turn of the century , its products pervaded French middle-class life . The company history at that time said : ' ' At every hour of the day , Peugeot is present . Madame gets up , puts on her corset ( Peugeot stays ) , turns on her gramophone ( Peugeot spring ) , opens her umbrella ( Peugeot frame ) , does odd jobs about the house ( Peugeot hammer and saw ) , tidies up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town ( Peugeot bicycle ) . // Nowadays Peugeot is known mostly for its cars. // The goal of Peugeot ' s acquisitions of Citroen and Chrysler Europe ( renamed Talbot ) was to reduce basic component costs through bigger production runs . ' ' It ' s going to produce economies down the road , ' ' Mr. Dial says . For instance , the company will start producing an engine for the Talbot Horizon in July which later will go under the hood of Peugeots. // ' ' You have to be a certain size to be a factor in Europe , ' ' Dial notes . About 10 million cars are sold per year in Western Europe , about the same as in the US in a normal year . Six companies , Renault , Fiat , VW , Ford , GM , and Peugeot , each sell more than 1 million cars annually , with such producers as BMW , Mercedes , Alfa Romeo , and Volvo selling smaller numbers. // Thus , despite the difficulties of merging English-oriented Chrysler Europe with French-speaking Peugeot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Dial claims. // One aspect of the merger has been a surplus of dealers . In Italy , for instance , the company has some 200 Talbot dealers and some 200 Peugeot dealers . Dial admit that sometimes the dealers fight each other for sales. // A goal of the company is to reduce the number of ' ' families ' ' of cars from some 10 now to five or six over the next four to six years . This , says Dial , will be done in an evolutionary rather than revolutionary manner . The number of engines might be trimmed from about 14 to half that number , with four of these gasoline-fueled and three diesels. // Mr. Dial has just put into effect a new computer-based system that ties production of individual cars to sales . If the customers are ordering Peugeot 505s with automatic shifts and painted green , the assembly line will make them promptly . Before , the plants had to guess on what models and extras customers would order . ' ' We never could get the right car to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s sake , Mr. Dial ' s ' ' modern marketing and selling techniques ' ' had better work . If the company ' s finances remain in bad shape and it needs government assistance , the French Socialist government would probably seek at least 35 percent of the capital , providing effective state control. // //
