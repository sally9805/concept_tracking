As ministers fiddle , a menacing oil slick continues to spread <P> Oil has been the font of their prosperity for decades , but now the wealthy sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf are almost literally swimming in the gooey , black liquid . Since March , three damaged Iranian wells have been spewing some 7,000 bbl. a day of crude into the waters of the gulf , producing an oil slick that is roughly the size of New Jersey and that may rank as the second largest in history. * Much of the menacing sludge rests just below the surface of the gulf 's usually crystalline waters , but it is betrayed by a bluish sheen that can be seen easily from the air . Last week , as the vast slick threatened to wash ashore , it triggered a near panic in the eight nations that border on the gulf . <P> The spill endangers marine life as well as industrial installations along the shoreline . The gravest threat is to the huge desalination plants that Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain and the other arid nations depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Straits of Hormuz last week , armies of workmen were ringing the shore with floating plastic booms designed to protect the plants ' intake valves . Meanwhile , panicky shoppers in Qatar went on a hoarding spree , pushing the price of bottled mineral water to almost $1 a liter-more than five times the OPEC price for crude oil . Officials from Iran and the seven Arab states that border on the gulf belatedly decided to meet in Kuwait to search for a solution to the problem , but the politics of the 2-year-old Iran-Iraq war quickly got in the way . At week 's end there was no agreement on how to cap the gushers , much less on how to clean up the resulting mess . Even as the ministers spoke , patches of tar started to wash up on Bahrain 's sandy beaches . <P> The spill began in late January , when a storm toppled a rig in Iran 's Nowruz oil field at the northern tip of the gulf . The well had already been damaged two years ago , when a tanker rammed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sea . In March , Iraqi helicopter gunships bombed at least two other wells in the same oil field . Those wells began leaking up to 5,000 additional bbl. a day . <P> Ordinarily such leaks are repaired within weeks . Iran says that it sent experts to inspect the damage , but that they were bombarded by the Iraqis in air attacks . On March 2 , Iraq announced that any ships that came near the damaged platforms would be treated as military targets . Iranian officials say they had offered Texan Red Adair , the world 's best-known oil troubleshooter , $1 million to supervise a repair effort , but that he refused to work under war-time conditions . The immense slick developed , says a Western diplomat in Bahrain , because " no one will go out there and cap a well unless he 's sure he is not going to be shot at . "
