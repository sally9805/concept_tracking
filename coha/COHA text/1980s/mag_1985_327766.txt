Once , after reading in a magazine that she was " the world 's most mysterious woman , " Agatha Christie complained to her agent : " What do they suggest I am ? A Bank Robber or a Bank Robber 's wife ? I 'm an ordinary successful hard-working author  --  like any other author . " Her success was not exactly ordinary . She produced nearly 90 novels and collections of stories in a lifetime that spanned 85 years . One of her plays , The Mousetrap , opened in London in 1952 and is still running . <P> She refined and left a lasting imprint on the detective formula . An " Agatha Christie " became a shorthand description for an unadorned display of crime unmasked by perceptive and relentless logic . She dared readers to outwit her , and few resisted the challenge . Shortly after her death in 1976 , one estimate put the worldwide sale of her works at 400 million copies . Given such glittering evidence and the clues provided by her fiction , a mystique was bound to develop around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishwoman with a power to murder and create . When she insisted that the truth was far less exotic , armchair sleuths who had been trained by her books recognized a false lead when they saw one . <P> She was right , of course , as this biography , the first written with the blessings of Christie 's heirs and estate , conclusively proves . Author Janet Morgan does a thorough job of getting the facts in the Christie case straight and on the record . But the story , even when demystified , seems almost as unbelievable as the guessing games it prompted . <P> Her childhood could have been written by Jane Austen . Agatha Miller , beloved by her parents and an older sister and brother , grew up in an English seaside village surrounded by Edwardian privileges and leisure . Her American father lived off a trust fund that dwindled steadily , and his death when Agatha was eleven left family finances ever more unsteady . Still , breeding and manners meant as much as money , and the young woman , largely educated at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down three proposals and took a flyer instead . After a stormy courtship , she married Archie Christie , a dashing aviator with few expectations of living through World War I. <P> While he fought , his new bride stayed home , working in a hospital . Her sister suggested that Agatha , who was both exhausted and bored during her free time , try to write the sort of detective novel they both enjoyed reading . She did , but by the time The Mysterious Affair at Styles appeared in print , the war was over and Agatha had a daughter , and a husband , grounded at last , who seemed chiefly interested in making money and playing golf . <P> The year 1926 changed her prospects and her life . For one thing , she published The Murder of Roger Ackroyd , which caused a stir because it broke the rules of detective fiction : the narrator did it . Something more shocking followed . In December Agatha left her husband and child and disappeared for ten days , setting off a nationwide search and a carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meticulous , but it lacks , perhaps unavoidably , the tight resolution that Christie gave her invented plots .
