Anger and vengefulness spur an Olympic pullout <P> The Olympic flame , kindled at the ruins of Olympia in Greece , arrived in New York City twelve hours later aboard a U.S. Air Force jet . It was a dispiriting day for pageantry : raw , windy , drizzly . But as runners started the torch on its zigzag , 15,000-kilometer journey across 33 of the 50 American states , the dark skies seemed only to intensify the symbolic glow . The second runner , 91-year-old Abel Kiviat , silver medalist in the 1,500-meter race in the 1912 Olympics , had no inkling that anything was amiss as he ended his appointed kilometer ; he lit the torch of twelve-year-old Timothy Towers , who had won the honor in a raffle , and urged , " Carry on . " But as the 22nd runner , Nicole Zell , age 13 , started her kilometer outside city hall in Manhattan shortly after noon , word crackled over radios in the sparse crowd that the Olympics were once more being seared by political animosity . Moscow had just announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles Coliseum on July 28 and President Reagan officially declares the XXIII Olympic Games in the modern series to be open , no athletes from the U.S.S.R. will be there to compete . <P> Nor will the superb runners and swimmers from East Germany , one of the world 's top three athletic powers , judged by medals won in past Olympics . Nor any athletes from Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Laos , Mongolia or Viet Nam . Almost certainly , the Poles and Hungarians will stay home , though nothing is official yet ; the Cubans are probable no-shows too . The Soviets obviously have carefully orchestrated the boycott , with one satellite after another falling into line , often a day apart . " We are going to be receiving a one-a-day bitter pill for some time , " predicts Peter Ueberroth , president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee ( L.A.O.O.C. ) . He also fears that the Kremlin leaders will try to extend the boycott " far beyond the normal Soviet bloc countries . " <P> Why ? One reason undoubtedly is simple revenge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycotting the 1980 Olympics , held in Moscow , as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 . Though that pullout was widely dismissed in the West as a futile gesture , it hurt the Soviets ' pride more than many Americans ever realized . It also dashed their hopes of putting on a spectacular show that would advertise Soviet athletic and organizational achievements to a television audience around the world . The Kremlin 's leaders are widely believed to have been itching to pay Washington back in the same coin .
