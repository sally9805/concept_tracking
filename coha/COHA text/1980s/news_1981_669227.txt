The owners ' big propaganda weapon , of course , is the rapid escalation of salaries in recent years . It ' s difficult for the public to understand why such highly paid workers would walk off their jobs . How can they be dissatisfied with such a good deal ? How much more do they want ? // It ' s only human nature to think this way , and the owners are only too happy to exploit it . They tell anyone who will listen that today ' s high salaries are driving them all to the poorhouse , and they say the only solution is to make new rules that will keep the payrolls down. // This is all so patently absurd that it ' s amazing anyone even listens to it , but people do . So perhaps now , with the strike already nearly a week old , it ' s time to clear up a few misconceptions . First , it will be a long time before anyone will have to hold a benefit for a club owner . They love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all of us should realize by now that these " losses " exist only in the fertile imaginations of the tax lawyers. // Baseball is already a very lucrative business , and with the expected growth of cable TV , even today ' s huge profits may well be dwarfed by those of the future . The owners can afford the big salaries , all right ; they ' d just prefer to keep more of the money for themselves , in the manner to which they became accustomed before free aency. // Just how much the various clubs do makes is an intriguing question , and one to which we aren ' t about to get an answer . Which brings us to another key point. // Although management loves to tell the press and public how tough things are , it always conveniently neglects to mention this " fact " at the bargaining table . Could that possibly be because of the rule that says if you claim inability to pay during negotiations , you have to open your books to demonstrate the point ? // The players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far this time by all their public utterances about impending financial disaster . The National Labor Relations Board agreed , saying that the owners should open their books . But eventually the owners won a court ruling that they could keep not-so-little secrets to themselves , since they had been smart enough to say these things for public consumption only  --  and never as a formal negotiating point. // So much for the owners ' ability to pay . Now let ' s look at the question of whether the players deserve those big salaries. // The first thing to do is dispose of the management-inspired idea that most major leaguers earn around $160 , 000 a year . This may be an average figure , but even a little second- grade math should make it clear that the two things aren ' t the same . If 10 players have an average salary of $160 , 000 , for instance , and one of them happens to have one of those million-dollar-a-year contracts we hear so much about , then the nine others are averaging somewhere between $60 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , but not quite as astronomical as the owners would like us to believe . And remember , these are professionals at the very top of their field. // As for those relatively few super duper salaries , a player ' s value is based on ( 1 ) his contributions on the field , and ( 2 ) his ability to attract fans . If he ' s well up there in both categories  --  like a Reggie Jackson or a Pete Rose  --  he ' s probably worth even more than what he ' s getting. // Of course it is ridiculous  --  and doesn ' t say much for our society ' s sense of values  --  that the spectacle of men playing a children ' s game is able to generate all those millions . But that ' s neither here nor there . The money does come in , so the only question left is where it should go . And the best way to answer this one is to ask when was the last time anybody bought a ticket or turned on his TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax at his country estate ? // This principle  --  that the people putting on the show are entitled to the bulk of the profits  --  is accepted without question in all other segments of the entertainment industry . In fact , the incomes of TV and movie stars like Johnny Carson , Robert Redford , etc. , make even the highest baseball salaries look like coolie wages by comparison . So what is all the fuss about ? // When Sandy Koufax was in his heydey , just to cite one instance , the Dodgers found that his presence on the mound usually meant about 10 , 000 more people in the stands . Since a pitcher starts about 20 homes games a year , that ' s 200 , 000 extra fans he puts in the park  --  and even at a most conservative estimate of $5 total outlay per fan , that comes to an additional $1 million in revenue he generated over and above what he was worth as a star of a successful team . And even this doesn ' t count how much he meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra revenue he produced on the road. // Whatever Koufax made  --  and by today ' s standards it wasn ' t much  --  he was grossly underpaid . The same held true for Ron Guidry when he was packing them in at Yankee Stadium a few years ago , and it happened again this spring with Fernando Valenzuela in Los Angeles . Both of these players generated huge amounts of money while seeing very little of it themselves , since they happened to be in the low range of the salary structure . Can anyone blame them for wanting to get theirs in subsequent contracts ? // The current strike , of course , is not over specific salaries ( these are negotiated individually ) , but over the issue of " compensation " to a club that loses a player via free agency . It comes down to money in the end , though , because obviously if a team singing a free agent has to turn over a valuable player of its own in return , it changes the whole structure of the deal and reduces the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It becomes , in fact , a sort of trade  --  going back to the old days before the courts ruled that teams didn ' t " own " players for their entire careers . The players have already won that issue on the legal battlefield , and they obviously have no intention of giving it up at the bargaining table. // So the next time anyone tries to make the players the villains in this strike , one might well ask ( 1 ) why don ' t the owners open their books and show everyone how impoverished they are , and ( 2 ) who deserves the lion ' s share of the revenue  --  the athletes the fans are paying to see or the businessmen sitting out there getting a few rays on their yachts and clipping their coupons ? // //
