" Cruel is the strife of brothers , " wrote Aristotle . The observation , it seems , applies even in the normally bland and polite world of Japanese business , specifically in the case of the Tsutsumi brothers , whose quiet rivalry has led not only to strife but also to success and enormous wealth . If that is not enough to inspire a crackling TV mini-series , add the fact that at least one of their fortunes rests on the graves of shoguns . <P> Seiji Tsutsumi , 61 , is the dapper , soft-spoken head of the Seibu Saison Group ( 1987 sales : $28 billion ) , a conglomerate of department stores , supermarkets and service organizations . Yoshiaki Tsutsumi , 54 , square jawed and hard driving , owns the Seibu Railway group , which operates $400 billion worth of railways , hotels , golf courses and ski resorts . The two are half brothers and have long been locked in intense competition . Last fall the conflict broke into the open when Seiji 's Seibu Saison Group acquired the Inter-Continental hotel chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel domain . <P> " They are as different as water and fire , " says a family friend . Seiji and Yoshiaki are the sons of the late Yasujiro Tsutsumi , a cantankerous millionaire who became speaker of the lower house of the Diet after making a fortune in railroads , hotels and department stores . Nicknamed " Pistol " for his buccaneering business methods , Yasujiro bought out impoverished aristocrats who could not pay inheritance taxes during the late ' 40s and early ' 50s , put up hotels on the newly acquired land and cockily called the hotel chain Prince . The 484-room Tokyo Prince , for example , is set on the former cemetery of the Tokugawas , the shoguns who ruled Japan for 265 years before the Meiji Restoration began in 1868 . <P> When the elder Tsutsumi died in 1964 , the two brothers inherited dramatically different amounts and parts of their father 's empire , parts that fit their sharply divergent personalities and amounts that apparently reflected the feelings between father and sons . The cultured and mild-mannered Seiji , the son of Yasujiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an award-winning poet whose early literary work sometimes suggested filial embarrassment and even enmity . <P> Yoshiaki 's life took a less refined path . His mother was one of Yasujiro 's mistresses . This illegitimate son was the favorite , and he still praises his father as " the greatest entrepreneur I 've ever met . " While Seiji was merely given control of a money-losing department store , Yoshiaki inherited not only the railway and real estate portions of the empire but also his father 's political clout : he is close to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita , for example , and backed him in his fight for the leadership in 1987 . A rugged sportsman who owns the national-champion baseball team , the Seibu Lions , Yoshiaki flies around the country aboard his jet helicopter to visit his properties and shows up on lists of the world 's wealthiest people . He has an estimated net worth of $18.9 billion , compared with Seiji 's $1.8 billion .                    @
