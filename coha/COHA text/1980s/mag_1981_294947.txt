Ronald Reagan is at once more a part of the Washington scene than his predecessor , and , in another way , more removed . He has , as every President before , begun making his own patterns of leadership and life in the White House . <P> He is husbanding his personal privacy ; yet he ventures forth more in person into the regular capital routines . Perhaps it is his conditioning in show business that makes it so . In that world the adoration of the masses is cultivated , but the crowds are in most instances kept at a certain distance . <P> For 20 years now , reporters have verbally manhandled the President , leaping and shouting for attention , then muscling the victim up front as if he were an inferior intellectual adversary . Before Reagan walked on the stage at his first televised press conference last week , he established a barrier between him and the 300 journalists . It was a simple device . Through Press Secretary James Brady , he outlined rules of behavior requiring the questioners to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized . Reagan presided . The press did not . <P> A couple of Saturdays ago , after a Cabinet meeting , the President wandered over to the Alibi Club on I Street , a narrow and shadowy enclave of 50 of the city 's powerbrokers . He went without the usual army of photographers . He did not hold court once he was inside . <P> The men there did not cluster around him but came one by one to chat with Reagan , who talked of the rundown condition in which he had found the White House , of his adjustments to life in the mansion . It was unspectacular and disarming . The President left as quietly as he came . <P> That-night he was on the town again , this time a guest of the Alfalfa Club . That organization has no reason for being other than to meet once a year for fun , but can pack into a hotel dining room 600 of the nation 's most influential men . <P> Reagan did not arrive late with trumpets and spotlights . He was there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator John Glenn and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to give his speech , which was nice but not notable , and then slipped out so that he would not paralyze the after-dinner festivities . Nobody was dazzled , but even the loyal opposition felt a little warmth toward the man for displaying such natural dignity . <P> There was other evidence of his style . Reagan opened the ceremonies for the returning hostages and then receded . Cameras were banned from sensitive and emotional moments . No detailed reports were given of Cabinet meetings or other sessions with key Administration figures . They were , in the official jargon , " characterized . " What had the President done on a Sunday night ? the White House was asked . We do n't know , said an aide , that is his private time . <P> Meetings with legislators and visitors were cautious affairs in which Reagan listened far more than he talked . He asked questions of the experts and then waited out the full answers . When questions were directed at him , even on sensitive subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only a short generalized observation that revealed almost nothing . There was no compulsion to let his innermost views gush forth . A wise Washington hand , Speaker Sam Rayburn , used to say that you do n't have to explain what you do n't say . Maybe Reagan heard .
