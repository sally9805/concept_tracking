It was a typical Sunday-night amateur show at the Improvisation comedy club in Los Angeles . Five minutes onstage for a blond dwarf who joked about her " white evening gowns made by Fruit of the Loom . " Another five minutes for a purported Indian mystic called Ramogosh , who closed his act with a Sinatra- style rendition of I Did It Buddha 's Way . After a parade of two dozen such neophytes , the audience of 200 was ready for some professional comedy  --  and ecstatic when , at a quarter to 11 , Jay Leno bounded onto the stage . <P> Leno , the lantern-jawed king of the stand-up circuit , had dropped by to try out some new material . Dressed in a silk shirt , faded jeans and Western boots , he barreled through 20 minutes of jokes , some of them written only that day and jotted down on note cards . On the Iran-contra hearings : " Senator Inouye . . . now there 's a strict-looking guy . He 's the principal of the United States of America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I love the way they describe these women as part-time models . I brush my teeth every morning  --  does that make me a part-time dentist ? " On Princess Di : " With twelve bodyguards around her all the time , how could she possibly have an affair ? ' Where are you going , honey ? ' ' Just out to christen a battleship , dear . ' " <P> An unexpected 20 minutes from the hottest stand-up comedian in America  --  not bad for a Sunday-night club outing . But not that surprising either . Stand-up comics are suddenly everywhere . On TV they get nightly exposure on such talk shows as Tonight and Late Night with David Letterman , as well as on their own specials for cable networks like HBO and Showtime . Jackie Mason , a veteran stand-up performer from the ' 50s and ' 60s , made a smash comeback by turning his comedy routines into the current hit Broadway show The World According to Me . And Steve Martin is just one of a long and stellar list of former stand-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and movie careers . <P> Comedy stars of the future are being nurtured in a rapidly growing nationwide network of comedy clubs . A few big-city night spots , like New York 's Improvisation ( sister club of the Los Angeles version ) and Los Angeles ' Comedy Store , have for years served as a proving ground for young comics , helping launch the careers of Robin Williams , Joe Piscopo , David Letterman and dozens more . Now clubs with names like the Punch Line , Laff Stop and Funny Bone are spreading the yuks everywhere from Kalamazoo , Mich. , to Ozark , Ala . At least 260 full-time comedy clubs  --  ranging from posh nighteries like New York 's Caroline 's to converted Chinese restaurants  --  are currently in operation , according to Barry Weintraub , publisher of a magazine called Comedy U.S.A. ; two-thirds of them were launched within the past five years .
