In his final years in the major leagues , Ball Four Author Jim Bouton , 43 , was always looking for a gimmick to extend his pitching career , and as an ex-ballplayer , he has not changed much . His idea for Big League Chew , a bestselling chewing plug-like pouch of shredded gum for sand-lot Harvey Kuenns , made Bouton rich . And he has now moved on to the diamond status symbol that really separates the men from the boys : baseball cards . ( The men are on them , and the boys collect them . ) Bouton has come up with a proletarian variation on the real thing , individually printed baseball cards for even the weekend rightfielder . Bouton produces regulation-size , full-color replicas with any subject 's face on the front and his stats on the reverse . Cost : $25 for a minimum of 50 cards , gum included . That 's only a bit more than Bouton 's real card is worth . " Mickey Mantle 's card from his rookie year sells for around $2,500 , " sighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some reason it does n't sell for the same price as Mickey 's .

Kerr 's role in the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation next month on CBS is a departure from the oh-so-proper image that she usually projects . Says she : " Playing a bossy nurse to a tempestuous old gentleman is much more fun than playing glamorous women . " And , as Richardson would surely add , a good deal more fun for the old gentleman too . <P> <P> It was intended as a gala reception for French Photographer Jacques-Henri Lartigue , 88 , but the models stole the show . Christie Brinkley , 27 , and Cheryl Tiegs , 35 , both came to meet the master snapshot artist at New York City 's International Center of Photography . The two had never modeled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occasion- Miracle on Seventh Avenue-they were outfitted in the same dress , a black taffeta by a new fashion flash named Fabrice . It may be the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a woman , but , says Christie , " it does wonders for the designer . " <P>
