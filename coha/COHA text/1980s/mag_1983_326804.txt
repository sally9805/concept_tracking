The three major nightly news shows gird for a fall battle <P> The professional life of a network TV news anchor is too hectic to be called solitary , too lucrative to qualify as nasty or brutish , but often short : Walter Cronkite of CBS has been the only first-stringer at any network to hold the job to retirement age . Last week the industry shook its kaleidoscope once again . What seemed to be emerging , by week 's end , was a pattern that American viewers have hardly ever seen : head-to-head , half-hour competition among solo anchors at all three commercial networks . <P> The current champion , CBS 's intense , adrenal Dan Rather , 51 , will be matched , starting on Labor Day , against NBC 's boyish Tom Brokaw , 43 , who at present is a coanchor . At ABC , which has had a three-cornered format , executives are expected to announce this week that elegant , Canada-born Peter Jennings , 45 , will be the central figure of a revamped one-anchor show .

" <P> The shift in pattern was prompted by the death two weeks ago of ABC 'S Washington-based anchor , Frank Reynolds . After he went on sick leave in April , ABC 'S nightly news ratings dropped from second place to third , but the advantage went mostly to CBS . Those results convinced top officials at NBC that the pairing of the puckish Brokaw and dour Roger Mudd , 55 , had little chance of catching on . A peripatetic workaholic , Brokaw has made mild fun of Mudd 's reluctance to leave Washington in pursuit of story or spectacle . Though Brokaw continues to regard Mudd as a friend , he was described by NBC sources as having lobbied for the change . Says Brokaw : " Both of us felt that at times the two-anchor format was an unnatural division of labor .

Later Mudd agreed to share the job to help NBC keep Brokaw . For his pains , Mudd was reassigned to what he does as well as nearly anyone else in television , political reporting . He announced his ouster to newsroom colleagues last Tuesday . Nothing was said on the show that night about the shift , because Frank anticipated " an awkward moment , whether Mudd or Brokaw reported it . " Afterward , however , Mudd allowed that he had longed to close the show with the ironic salutation , " Good night from all of them at NBC News . "
