Jesse Jackson 's " rainbow coalition " once contained virtually a single color : black . But what a difference four years has made . An impressive aspect of Jackson 's 1988 candidacy is his acceptance by many white voters . Last week white Jackson supporters around the country explained why they are joining in the chorus of " Win , Jesse , win ! " <P> " I 'm drawn to a candidate I believe in , someone who could possibly carry the goals and ideals I found in the ' 60s . His whole campaign has been a healing process for the party . He 's talking about issues and people we 've ignored for years : drugs and economic devastation , issues that transcend ethnic and religious problems . The other candidates are just politicians . I ca n't get excited about them . " <P>  --  JOAN SCERBO ; LYNDHURST , N.J. <P> " He 's got a feeling for people who have suffered , and the reason , I think , is because of his childhood and upbringing . He is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he speaks , you do n't just hear what he 's saying , you feel what he 's saying . I think he 'd make a great President . " <P>  --  TIM WHALEN , LAWYER ; BILLINGS , MONT . <P> " He 's saying the right things about agriculture that we need in order to survive . When you listen to the other candidates , never do they even mention agriculture . It 's like it does n't exist . He 's for people , working people . The big barracudas , the corporations , he 'll put them in their place too . " <P>  --  LYLE QUICK , FARMER ; CIRCLE , MONT .
