 --  You can see me ? He nodded , and saw the old man 's military moustache move up and down to mask a rare emotion.  --  Well , then God 's not on vacation as I thought He was , Auerbachsaid . Now , if we can only get you out of here , we can be on our way.  --  France ?  --  France it is . But now 's the time to get you out . Not after they 've got you caged behind barbed wire in Germany . Reszke and Gerlach jumped out of a prison train , but they did n't have a dozen holes in them . We 've got to find a way to carry you out.  --  Maybe I 'll grow wings , Ludo said . Since the age of Polish miracles does n't seem to be over yet.  --  And maybe I 'll paint you yellow and call you a canary . No . I 'll have to think of something else . We carry dead men out of here every day , but the German doctors have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more into unconsciousness , Ludo whispered : Damned if I oblige them .... How are all the others ?  --  Reszke and Gerlach left for the mountains just as soon as the Germans folded up their siege lines . They 'll be in Hungary before the snow starts falling . They said to tell you they 'll have a bird warmed up for you when you get to France . The rest of us are hiding in the city . He had another visitor , a Luftwaffe oberstleutnant who came to offer his compliments to Ludo and to ask whether there was anything that he could do for him . It was a piece of Old World courtesy that went with the well-remembered Viennese accent of the oberstleutnant . Other than a swift reversal of their roles , Ludo could think of nothing that he wanted from him . He lay in his own stench on his soiled mattress while the impersonal rubber hands of German military surgeons dressed his burns , caked his eyes with ointments , and tagged him for shipment to a prison camp . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so could sustain the illusion that he too was bathed , shaved , neatlyp101uniformed , and erect . The German was the victor and he was one of the malodorous vanquished ; yet a mutually understandable currentpassed between them even as the soft , drawling coffee-cream voice of the oberstleutnant identified him as the commander of the Messerschmitts with the orange noses.  --  We never expected you to give us such a fight , the oberstleutnantsaid . But one does learn from the unexpected , does one not ? And one does go to the trouble of identifying an enemy like you . Ludo said nothing to the German . They were linked by a currentas strong as destiny ; they 'd have to meet again , he knew . In the meantime , the gulf between them was measurable in decibels of pain , and the oberstleutnant was staring about the littered ward with obvious distaste . His face was weathered , narrow , and surprisingly lenient . The body was slight , slim , compact as a dancer 's . On his right-breast pocket he wore the golden Spanienkreuz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had fought in Spain , and the First Class of the Iron Cross with 1939 engraved on its bar . His name , he said , was Walther Reinecke , commander of Lehrjagdstaffel VI , on temporary duty with the SS , the Gestapo , and the Golden Eagles of the Nazi Party who were moving into Warsaw on the heels of the combat soldiers . He did nothing to hide his contempt for the policemen and the politicians.  --  We 'll move you to a good Luftwaffe hospital in a day or two , the oberstleutnant said . That 's the least we can do.  --  And then ? Ludo 's dull , muffled voice astonished them both .  --  And then ? Well , that 's for them to decide . In any event , the war is over for you.  --  I would n't count on that , Ludo said.  --  By the upside-down balls of Saint Peter , I 'd shake your hand if you had a spare one , said the oberstleutnant and , for the first time , looked thoughtful and bemused . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wire-rimmed spectacles had accompanied him , pointing to this wounded man or another , consulting his files , and a noncom in a coarse black uniform tied cardboard shipping labels around the necks of wounded officers.  |p102He  knotted each loop like a small hangman 's noose and laughed as he did it.  --  Just an innocent little bit of fun , he said and grinned as he caught the oberstleutnant 's eye . Anyway , this other burned mummy over here smells like a Jew to me . The glance which passed between Ludo and the oberstleutnant contained elements of pity , shame , and bitter promise . What the troubled oberstleutnant seemed to be saying then was : Look , you 've got to understand this , we 're not all like that . You and I are fighting men . We kill each other , but we do n't humiliateeach other . We can appreciate each other 's qualities more than any other kind of soldier because we are airmen ! What happenson the ground has nothing to do with us . We do n't even live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that 's worth . So let it pass , forget it as quickly as you can . Neither you nor I can expect anything worthwhile out of our own element . What Ludo 's glance was meant to convey to the German in reply was : Never mind all that . One day , I 'll have to kill you to erase this moment . That night , the autumn rains began . The rain that turned the Polish country roads into impassable quagmires every year , and for which the whole nation had prayed throughout that parched September , seemed like the last ironic stroke now that the war was over . It flowed down the cracked walls , through the shattered ceilings . It flooded the corridor . Ludo could n't sleep . Half awake , half drifting in a nightmare , he listened to the sounds of a captive city : whistles , distant commands to halt , and shots . The night was dull with pain , fear , sudden death ; he thought he might go mad . He listened to the gurgling hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man , who was known simplyas The Burn , had neither moved nor made any kind of sound before . He was swathed in grimy bandages that robbed him of features . The yellow-gray rags that formed what must have been a face , in much the same way that Ludo 's own face had been wrapped by surgeons , were punctured by one small , dark hole , and it was out of this that the sound was coming . It was less ap103whisper than a creaking sigh , and Ludo had to harness his entire attention to make out the words.  --  Have you . . . hands ? creaked the awful whisper  --  What ? Hands ? Yes , he said.  --  Ah . . . and mercy ? Have you some of that ?  --  Nobody has that , Ludo said.  --  But you 're an educated man ? An officer ?  --  For what that 's been worth.  --  You 'd not be . . . ah . . . inhibited by superstition , then ?  --  No more than anyone , Ludo said.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ludo found himself unable to speak for a moment. - What are you saying , man ?  --  I hear you talking to yourself , the whisper hissed and gurgled . You talk about escaping , fighting . . . killing people ... . Why do n't you kill someone who wants to be killed ?  --  Nobody wants to be killed , Ludo said and felt his own cold sweat inflaming his wounds.  --  I do , the Burn whispered . It would be . . . Christian charity .  --  Then ask someone else.  --  Whom should I ask ? the strangled whisper hissed . Where should I look for it ?  --  I do n't know . But you wo n't find it here.  --  Not anywhere , it seems . Listen . I hear you talking with your friends . Aboutgetting away . I can help you there.  --  How can you help anyone ?  --  Who leaves this place and goes free ? Corpses leave it . You need a corpse to switch your label with . The corpse stays as you , you leave as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to escape.  --  You must be mad , Ludo said.  --  You 've got to do it . You 've killed men before ! Look , every sound I make is agony . Spare me the need to argue . End my pain and you 're as good as free.  --  For God 's sake , be quiet !  - -  I too am an officer , the Burn hissed and gurgled . Oh , not much of one , I admit . An imitation officer , as it 's said . But , even so , that ought to count for something . If you wo n't kill me out ofp104hatred . . . and not out of mercy . . . will you help a brother officer ? It would be . . . your duty .  --  For God 's sake , no ! Ludo said . In the last graying hours before dawn , when the shadows were still mercifully dark , the burned man said that he was a **26;10747;TOOLONG , an actor by profession , and , as a Jew , destined for the garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy logic of a man for whom pain had no thresholds that he was a corpse whether he breathed or not , that even if , by some miracle , he survived the hospital , he 'd be killed somewhere else , and that no SS guard would give more than a passing glance to a dead Jew carted out for unrecorded burial.  --  An . . . unrecorded burial , Major , he hissed . A point worth the making . No fuss . No questions . Out of the door . . . and gone . So be a Jew for half an hour , Major . Why do n't you ? It 's not all that bad . And . . . anyway . . . you 'll recover from it . As for himself , the Burn would masquerade as Ludo in Ludo 's bed and with Ludo 's shipping tag around his bandaged throat . One set of dirty bandages wrapped around a head looks much like another . So who 'll know , eh ? asked the dreadful whisper . The worst thing that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and God was sure to understand it and forgive it.  --  No , Ludo whispered . I ca n't do that.  --  Antysemita , hissed the Burn . You 'd do it for a German .  --  Leave me alone , said Ludo . Why do n't you kill yourself , if that 's what you want ?  --  I 've no hands , the Burn said . Then , gurgling : Can you imagine an actor . . . at the Yiddish Theater . . . with no hands ?  --  No , Ludo said . Then it was morning . The one thing that had kept him relatively sane in his weeks of pain , sleeplessness , and blindness was his fevered determination to escape . But how ? Even the damp , cold weather conspired against him . His wounds had opened ; some had become infected . Deep sleep ( the senses all but shut off and only an occasional drift ofp105thought ) had become impossible , so there was little difference betweenwakefulness and sleeping . Morphine had changed his hormonelevels and his biological clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet ruin of the corridor , among the not-quite-dead who could n't be saved , he drifted in and out of a ninety-minute cycle of nonsleep and a never-quite-alert state of waiting for a dream in which he might be safe from either misadventure , memory , or imagination . He listened to the softer whispers of Auerbachand Bettner.  --  He ca n't walk , Bettner said . So how do we move him ?  --  If you 're supposed to be a German , as your name implies , why do n't you think like one ? Auerbach said . He dies and we take him out to the garbage truck.  --  And what do we do for a real corpse to show to the Ger-mans ?  --  Listen , Auerbach said . If there 's one thing in this town that we 're not short of these days , it 's corpses . We 're digging up a couple of hundred every day.  --  We 're supposed to be taking them out of the hospital , Papa Bettner said . We 're not supposed to be bringing , them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been assigned jobs in the city 's civil administration : Bettner as a recordsclerk in the municipal Office of Births and Deaths , and Auerbach as a garbageman whose horse-drawn , rubber-tired lorry doubled as a hearse in the early weeks of the occupation . It would be several weeks before the Gestapo weeded out such poisonous plants as they from the ordinary Volksdeutsche , the genuine Germanminority in Poland , who formed an eager network of Gestapocollaborators and informers . Their rewards were special rationcards , exemptions from police curfew and arbitrary seizure in the streets , and the confiscated property of Poles who had been their neighbors . In the meantime , Auerbach and Bettner had freedom of movement and official functions which took them in and out of the hospital every day . Awake , Ludo smiled up at them and they smiled worriedly at him.  --  There really is n't a great deal of time , Papa Bettner said . The Wehrmacht is handing over control of the city to the Gestapo and the Party people , and there are n't any Kaffee mit Schlag gentlemen among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pawiak prison . They have mass street hunts every day and anybody caught without an Ausweis or an Arbeitskarte gets to be a Ha f tling.  --  Just because they 've labeled you a Volkser , you do n't have to talk like one , do you ? Auerbach said.  --  It 's catching , Bettner shrugged and said.  --  So 's the plague , Auerbach said . But who 'd want to catch it ? If you 'd learn to think like one of them , instead of just talking , we would n't have any trouble in finding a good corpse . He nodded at the Burn , whose sudden gurgling sound could be identified as laughter.  --  I 'd say that a man who killed that poor son-of-a-bitch would be doing him a service . Then they were all quite still , not looking at each other , each aware of one cold thought they shared . Then Ludo fell back on his sodden mattress and whispered : No . Think of something else.  --  Did n't you hear what Papa said ? Auerbach asked quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been known simply as the Burn died during the night . His name was Izydor Kaminski . Because he was a lieutenantin the Army , albeit a reservist and a Jew , his death was recorded by Bettner on official forms for the International Red Cross , and Auerbach carried out his body ( Ludo ) in a sack to his unofficial hearse . Ludo 's own death was recorded the following morning when Kaminski 's shrouded corpse was found on Ludo 's mattress . For propaganda purposes of their own , the Luftwaffe gave him a military funeral with all appropriate honors . IN NOVEMBER , equipped with documents that Papa Bettner forged or stole from the Germans , they left Warsaw as Volksdeutsche volunteers for fortification work on the German-Soviet demarcationline that bisected Poland.  |p107In  the beginning , all of them believed that they had put their pasts behind them and that only a future lay ahead of them . Even Janek , who seemed to have lost his faith in everything , made optimistic plans for a return in spring . The French were expected to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the British and their great empires were sure to crush the Germansand their Russian allies , and the Poles would have their country once again . But the Roumanian border and what it represented to them when they began their march became somethingaltogether different by the time they reached it . The journey through the looted and dispirited wasteland of their country hardened and embittered them and finally convincedthem that there was no escape from a past such as theirs . They walked in rain , in darkness , through a sea of thick , loamy mud that sucked their boots off their legs and clung to their clothes and tainted everything they ate . They lived on what they could beg or steal on moonless nights . The villages they passed were lifeless , shuttered against intrusion , and even the dogs had a mad , tormented air . As long as they were moving through lands held by Polish peasants , it was possible for them to knock on any door , whisper a greeting , and walk away with bread , milk , apples , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy to lead them to a forest path that went around a roadblock . But these hospitable momentsbecame rare once they crossed the demarcation line . There , in the Russian Zone , patrolled by Cossack cavalry and the Red Militia , the eyes that looked at them were filled with hostility and suspicion and ( all too often ) a lad would be sent to get the NKVD while villagers distracted them with evasive answers . The Ukrainian peasants hated Poles as deeply as they hated Russians , and they took pleasure in using one set of enemies to destroy another . Nor were they content to leave it at that . Sometimes it was impossible to avoid passage through small market towns , and they split up and edged , singly or in pairs , through dark , glowering crowds to whom a stranger was anathema . Jacek Gemba , whom the hardships of their journey had thinned down into the semblance of a fourteen-year-old , pretendedthen to be a lad who was leading his blinded father ( Ludo ) to the local dealer in miracles and herbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away from it when he was a child , and there was nothing about it or its people that he did n't know.  --  This is where I 'd get a fist in the ear for breakfast and a kick for supper , and only my own knuckles to chew in between . It 's a hard land , sir . Death counts for nothing here.  --  I know , Ludo said . I remember.  --  Walls full of saints and a hungry belly , Jacek Gemba said . And if one man 's got to take his cap off to another , he 'll live on hate until one of them 's dead . In one such small town , they stood in a crowd against the wall of a shuttered wooden church , chewing sunflower seeds and wheat stalks while a pale young man in a leather coat harangued the crowd from the back of a Red Army truck , and they watched two bloodied officers led on halters by the Red Militia and locked in a pigsty , and they saw the peasants beat and drown another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool to look for mercy here , Jacek Gemba said . They walked at night and hid during the day in woods , marshland , misty copses of poplars and pine , and on the reedgrownbanks of streams . Then , as the meager stands of birch came to an end , as the land flattened further , they moved with greater caution , sometimes walking no more than five miles in a night . Thousands had gone that way before them , they could tell ; at each step through these southeastern woods , in roadside ditches and by wayside shrines , they came across the flotsam of a great migration : discarded pieces of uniforms , broken weapons , and  --  occasionally  --  the stripped and mutilated bodies of stragglerscaught by Ukrainian peasants . If any portion of this drab and gloomy land had ever known love , it was not evident . The peasants hunted for them in the woods , the Red Militia occupied the villages , and Russian cavalry patrolled the muddy tracks on shaggy-haired ponies . None of the fugitives looked anything like soldiers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hardly looked human . But to those who hunted them they would be as obviouslyPolish as if they were still in uniform . Time and again , they 'd come across bleached corpses , loosely covered with brushwoodand leaves , each with a crushed skull or a slit throat : youngp109soldiers who had accepted peasant hospitality on their way to the Roumanian border.  --  It did n't have to be like that at all , Papa Bettner said in one such moment of a horrible discovery . We 're the same race ; we were all one people at one time . What difference does it make if their priests many and ours do n't ? In God 's name , how do such things begin ?  --  In God 's name , Janek said . And does n't that tell you something about it all ?  --  No , Bettner mumbled . That 's not what this country was meant to be about.  --  Tell that to the Ukrainians and to the Red Militia , Janek said.  --  People have to begin to forgive each other , Papa Bettner said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And . . . you can get a lot more pleasure out of it . Almost at once , a light machine gun chattered at them out of a stack of felled timber at the far end of the clearing , and a hand grenade curved toward them darkly in the moonlight , and they scattered and ran . Janek carried Ludo slung across his shoulders . The woods around them echoed with shots , calls , cruel laughter , and , in the ever-growing distance of their headlong flight , with the dwindling sound of church bells rung in the nearby village . Finally , the night began to end . It was to be their last night in Poland . The river that marked the Roumanian boundary lay only half a day 's march away . They reassembled at the edge of the woods where , normally , they 'd spend their daylight hours . But on that morning , after that night , they had to risk open ground in daylight . Then , as the sun climbed higher and the concealment of the night was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaggy-haired pony loaded with panniers of firewood . In open fields , there was nowhere to hide.  |p110He  studied them quietly , then said : May God be praised .  --  Forever and forever , they replied in chorus . And had they come far ? Three hundred miles lay behind them , the hardships of their march were stamped on their faces , but to tell the truth would be dangerous.  --  Not far , Little Father , Ludo said in dialect . The peasant smiled and nodded . He was a gentle , fatherly old man with twinkling blue eyes in a weather-beaten face , and , for an instant that recalled every moment of innocence and childhood , such words as kindliness and honesty had some sort of meaning.  --  Such times , such times , the old man said sadly . That God should permit it . Could one still hope , then , for a human impulse ? The clatter of pursuit had fallen away but the images of the night were manstrouslyclear . Yet what could be more reassuring than this elderly villager in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strap ?  --  We bow to God 's will , Ludo murmured then.  --  In his hands lies our peace , the peasant replied . He wore a pair of Polish military breeches tucked into muddy bast boots . He had watched them calmly , unafraid , as they emerged from the last of the woods , and there was something so disarming in his lack of fear and suspicion that each of them felt an immense relief . Surely , not everyone was an enemy ! The old man smiled and nodded as they told their lies about being travelers from another village , and offered them cheese and black bread and a quart tin of sour milk to share . Shyly , as if fearinga rebuff , he offered them shelter . He had a barn , he said , not too far away . They could sleep there on dry straw . They could rest up for the last stretch of open country between them and the river . The river itself , he said , was high at this point , and swift with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swim it . His own son had been a Polish soldier and had gone over severalweeks before . He would be honored to feed and shelter the comrades of his son . Bettner was grinning from ear to ear , and Auerbach had sat down on a tree stump and allowed his huge shoulders to sag inp111weariness , and Ludo himself felt all his tensions ebbing at the prospect of rest , perhaps some hot food , a chance to dry his clothes , to take off his boots , perhaps even sleep . Sleep . . . great God in heaven ! When had that been possible for more than an hour at a time ? The temptation was almost impossible to resist.  --  As you 've guessed , Little Father , he said cautiously , we 're not really travelers from another village.  --  If not from one village , then from another , the old peasant said . Every man comes from somewhere , and a guest in the house is like God in the house . Ludo began to smile and to nod as the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , and death stood grinningat them in the form of the fatherly , inoffensive peasant . Who could fear such openness , such kindness ? It was Janek , whose finest instincts had been burned away , who whispered in Ludo 's ear that there was dried blood on the military breeches the peasant was wearing , or what looked like blood.  --  And what are all those brown stains on the shaft of your ax , Little Father ? The peasant said that he had killed a chicken earlier in the morning , a fine plump hen they could share with him and his wife after they 'd slept a bit . As for the breeches , proper soldier breeches , they had belonged to his son , the soldier , a corporal in the cavalry , no less . He had brought them home when he came back from war . That 's where the blood came from , he supposed , if that 's what it was . The Pany Soldaty would know about such things better than an old man who had never walked further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , did n't they agree ? Perhaps his son , the corporal , had slipped in some blood ... Perhaps that 's where it came from . . . But , as Saints George and Michael would attest , he had nothing in his heart but pity for the tired comrades of his son , and sorrow at their suffering . His home was theirs , his barn was theirs too . They could rest , eat , sleep . The border would be there to cross tomorrow as it was today.  --  Well , Ludo said and looked at the others . What do you think ?  --  What 's there to think about ? Papa Bettner said . He 's a kind ,  |p112decent  man . We have to trust someone ! All this hatred and suspicion . . . it 's got to end sometime ! The old man had taken off his straw hat and bowed from the waist , and Jacek Gemba brought his clenched fist down on the old man 's neck , and the old man crumpled into the mud.  --  What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jacek Gemba said softly : No peasant ever killed a chicken . That 's where the eggs come from . That 's cash crop in a village . You eat a chicken if it dies but you never kill one . And them there .. . them 's officer 's breeches , sir . No corporal in the cavalry ever wore a fine pair of twill pants like that . In the panniers , they found an officer 's Vis pistol and a hand grenade and seventeen silver eagles cut away from military caps . They took the hand grenade and the pistol . They took the peasant'sbast boots . They tethered the small horse on loose reins so that he might graze . They hanged the old man on the strap he used for a belt.  --  Why are we doing this ? Papa Bettner asked and pleaded for the old man 's life . How does this make us better than the other murderers ? Would n't it be enough just to tie him up and gag him to be found by someone after we are safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Ludo said no . His eyes were full of tears.  --  Just tell me why ? Papa Bettner pleaded.  --  Because it 's . . . necessary , Ludo said.  --  Necessary ? For the war or for you ? Or to keep hatred alive ? Then Bettner said nothing more and none of the others said anything to him . They spent the day , their last day in Poland , hidden in the wet , dank undergrowth of an abandoned graveyard , and waited for the sun to set in the gray sheets of rain that continued to fall in the west . The steep banks of the river , which they would cross at twilight , had become the final limit of their possibilities . They knew by the muffled sounds of footfall and the click of shod hooves on the occasional stone , that the patrols were movingall around them , and they wondered how soon they would be found . The Cossack cavalry would herd them to captivity , thep113Ukrainian peasants would torture them to death , the Red Militia would drag them off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . But , Ludo thought , it was n't likely that the Red Militia , as hated by the Ukrainian peasants as the Poles themselves , would wander far from their village billets . As they waited , they talked in low voices . He listened to them and to the hiss of the rain , and he slipped in and out of unconsciousness as if crossing back and forth between a dark room and an illuminated one in which all the momentsof his life were stored . ' What was this war about ? A soldier does n't ask that kind of a question . But the peace that followed would have to be so rewarding , so full of assurances of a better future , that all of the horrors of the past could be dismissed from memory and conscience . Why , suddenly , should he be troubled by conscience ? ( You owe it to us , Ludo , Wlada said invisibly through the hiss and crackling of the radio-telephone in a forest clearing , and the phrase , which had been merely irritating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I owe nothing ! And Jacek Gemba said at once : What 's wrong , sir ? Can I get you something ?  --  Nothing , he said . A stray thought . Not worth mentioning .  --  Yes , sir , Jacek Gemba said with no conviction in his worried voice . If you say so , sir . Perhaps the fault lay less in himself , Ludo knew , than in the Polish language in which the word for owe is the same as guilty . I owe nothing , he had said aloud , but what he really wanted to hear himself saying was that he was innocent of anyone 's death . Jacek Gemba was staring at him with concern and he closed his eyes so as to be alone . Alone , he counted ghosts . He sought explanations . In Poland , the past was always ready with unsolicited advicewhich had nothing to do with the realities of the present . He felt again the vague but poignant urge to grasp his life , embrace it , know it all at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that the more one strove to bridge the gap between things as they were and as they ought to be , the harder it was to evade futility . To his surprise , he slept . In the dream , the recurrent nightmarep114which appeared when he was very tired , the past and the future were coming together . He was a child running away from home while cavalry trumpets played , and then he was flying , and then he was destroying the murderers of his parents and the village in which he had been born . He was alone . Everyone else was dead . A city or a village was burning below him , a huge red heart was beating . Wrenched with nausea , he twisted away from the boomingin his ears , dived into inner silences , sought cover in the clouds . He was in flight from something invisible that pursued him and drove him toward something threatening that awaited him . Maddened peasants were hunting for him in the ruins of their fire-bombed homes . He would be safe in the ruins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants would n't enter that scorched maze of stones because of the ghosts . But he had lost his way ; he could n't find the ruins in which he belonged . Then he was falling , burning . He saw a red embrace unfolding below him ; saw it through a blood-red haze booming with explosions . A wind had seized him and was shaking him , but he was dead and he could not awake.  --  Wake up ! Wake up ! a distant voice was calling , and he said : To what ? What 's the point ?  --  The sun is going down , Janek said . Awake , yet feeling as though he were still dreaming , he looked around and saw an edge of scarlet appear beyond the screen of rain . The silhouettes of the gravestones had darkened . Crouched in the mist , they seemed like milestones.  --  Looks like it 's time to get moving again , sir , Jacek Gemba said . Are you hurting much ?  --  Enough to share it if anybody wants it . The young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Is that one of them metafory again , sir ? And what 's going to happen now ? I mean , we are going to come back home , are n't we ? Sometime ?  --  We 'll be back , Ludo said . You can depend on that.  --  Because if we do n't , sir , Jacek Gemba said . If . . . well , if something happens and we ca n't get back from that place we 're going to , then everything that 's happened here will 've been forp115nothing , do n't you think ? I mean , sir , that France , that 's all very well , but this is where we come from . And if that 's where we come from , that 's where we belong.  --  Out of the mouths of babes , Ludo said and smiled . You do n't make things difficult for yourself , do you ?  --  I 'm not smart enough for that , sir , Jacek Gemba said . I leave that to people that 's been educated . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be simple.  --  It 's not too late to turn back if you do n't want to go , Ludo said . Nobody will think badly of you if you do.  --  I 'm your orderly , sir , Jacek Gemba said . I go where you go . And all them foreign places  --  well , sir , that 'll be something to talk about when I 'm an old man . The river was only five kilometers away at this point , the mist was thinning everywhere , and the western horizon had become a blurred crimson haze . If they could leave at once , they would be at the border in an hour . And then what ? Roumania , Hungary , Yugoslavia , Italy , and France . . . the names fell like stones . Bettner sat on a burial mound , his head in his hands . Janek stared westward without a word , his eyes were remote . Ludo himself felt as if he 'd do anything to delay the moment of departure ; to leave now , to turn his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the reasons for the journey . He watched the others , and saw them watching him , and he listened to the trilling of the waterfowl around them , and he sniffed the damp air and peered into the mist.  --  Time to go now ? he asked  --  Not yet , I think , Auerbach said . Listen.  --  To what ?  --  The birdcalls , Auerbach said.  --  What about the birdcalls ? Sometime during their flight through the woods , Auerbach had lost his glasses ; almost blind without them , he turned his head this way and that , listening , and then he passed the edge of his hand across his throat.  --  Ryzuny , he said simply . I never thought you 'd forget that sound.  |  --  Ryzuny ? Janek said . What 's that all about ?  --  That 's how they talk to each other , the bastards , the old line chief said . They 've found us , that 's what it 's about . It will be death to move . Again , as if to mock them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasses that surrounded them . The sounds , sharp as a butcher 's knife , had more than just personal menace in them ; peasants goaded to slaughter were part of the history of these eastern lands . Their birdcalls fluttered in the mist and rain , and Ludo had an overpowering feeling of futility . To have come so close to the end of the journey , and to fail , was almost more than he could bear . The past  --  his past  --  waited like a creditor and the payment could no longer be deferred . His wounds , he noted , had opened again . His chest and shoulderswere covered with blood . The birdcalls , so familiar from the night when he had crouched in the ruins of his home , had becomeinsistent.  --  Who has the Vis and the hand grenade ? he asked  --  I do , Janek said.  --  Give them to me.  --  No one is going to disarm me again , Janek said.  --  Do what you 're told , boy , Ludo hissed , and Janek shook his head.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From now on , I make my own decisions . All my life I 've been the coddled little brother , looking up to others and playing the fool . You and Wlada and Piotr and Norwid gave me everything . It 's time to pay for it.  --  Do n't be a fool , Janek , Ludo said . Give me the weapons , and then all of you go down to the river . I 'll join you there as soon as I can.  --  How can you join us anywhere ? Janek said and grinned.  --  Maybe I 'd better stay instead , Auerbach said . I 'm an old man , I 've had my good times . And I can still move fast when I 've got to.  --  Enough of all this , Janek said . I 'm staying and that 's that . It 's my turn , do n't you see ? You 've had your wars . This one was mine and I lost it . And . . . anyway . . .  --  Please , Janek , Ludo begged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol and the hand grenade and get down to the river.  |p117I  'll hold them off until you 're well away . Dammit , it 's my duty ! Pale in the slanting rain and grinning like a skull , Janek said : Sorry to disappoint you , Ludo . Indeed , I 'm sorry about a lot of things . I 've been a fool , living in a fool 's world , believing the slogans . War was going to be such a wonderful adventure ! Well , even a fool has to grow up sometime . The adventure is over.  --  But they 'll kill you here ! Ludo cried.  --  Not necessarily , Janek said and grinned . Then he said : Do n't worry about me , I 'm not suicidal . I intend to get across that river too . So you just wait for me at the first kilometerstone on the other side of the Kuty bridge.  --  For the last time , Ludo said . Janek , I beg you . . . if you 've ever loved me.  --  What does love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol and the hand grenade . This is what counts . I 'm making my own decisions now . Is n't that what you brought me up to do ? Ludo wanted to say something more , to protest and argue and to issue orders , but Auerbach picked up one end of the improvisedstretcher on which he was lying , and Bettner picked up the other , and he lost consciousness almost as soon as they set off , trotting at a crouch . The pain of his wounds , the fever of infection , the hunger and exhaustion carried him into a miasmic world . There were sharp , hostile sounds in that vague world through which he was carried : cries dimmed by memory and distance , the crump of a bomb . In the cool , moist air of the riverbank , he regained consciousness and stared at a gently moving sea of rushes and reeds . Bettner , who sat beside him , held his hand.  --  Where 's Janek ? he said.  --  He said he 'd meet us on the other side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in Poland , then ?  --  Still in Poland . The river is fast here , a lot of debris . But the bank is gentle on the other side . Auerbach and Jacek are making a raft.  |  --  Has n't Janek come yet ?  --  It 's only been an hour , Papa Bettner said evasively . An hour 's not so long . You and I hid out in the ruins of your manor a lot longer than that.  --  Were there shots ? Cries ? Anything ? Did you hear anything ?  --  We heard some shots . We heard the hand grenade.  --  And you did nothing ? You just went on running for the river , you damned drunken coward ?  --  For God 's sake , Ludo ! Bettner cried , pale with grief and pain . Will you please have some mercy for someone before it 's too late ? Mercy . . . understanding . . . affection . . . has that becomequite impossible for you ? If your brother chooses to give his life for yours , does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clumsily , because in tears and close to collapse : ) He made his choice , Ludo , for good or for evil . Do n't try to take the meaning out of it.  --  But to leave him like that . . . with those butchers .. .  --  It need n't be the butchers , Papa Bettner said . There was some rifle fire . There was a burst or two from those Pepesha machinepistols that Russian noncoms carry . That means the Cossacksgot there . They have a high regard for personal courage , they would n't let the peasants get to him . Christ , they despise those peasants as much as we used to.  --  You offer me sick comfort , Papa , Ludo said.  --  What other kind do we have to offer each other ? Anyway , the boy has a damned good chance . He 's brave , he 's resourceful . He 's full of rage and cunning . He sees very little value to any kind of life , and that 's the sort that lives to a ripe old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you know where he 's buried . He might just surprise us all.  --  You do n't really believe that , Ludo said . Bettner shrugged , looked away .  --  Ah , now you 're asking the impossible of me . I have n't believed in anything for more than twenty years . Anyway , we 'll wait for him on the other side , as he asked us to . The brown muddy water was swift and cold and full of debris carried downstream from the old wooden bridge on the Kutyp119road : some planks , half-burned logs , the wreckage of a wagon , a dead horse or two . All of this , including one bloated , air-filled carcass , went into the making of Auerbach 's raft , on which they floated out into midstream , where the current seized them . Lashed to the logs and timbers , while the others clung to the raft with one hand and paddled with the other , Ludo listened for sounds in which he might read some hope for Janek 's survival , but all he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paddlingmen . Never a broad , important waterway , as this small untended corner of civilization had never been more than a dimly seen backwater of Continental history , the river twisted among brown ravines . It spilled into broad , stagnant pools full of hidden currentsand unexpected eddies ; its muddied depths held a variety of sunken objects designed to impale or to ram . Its Polish bank was high and forbidding and overgrown with rushes from which waterfowlrose in great screaming clouds . The birds wheeled , settled , and rose again . The sun climbed whitely in its own gray clouds and , as the raft spun in chaotic circlestoward the flat and sandy bank on the Roumanian side , Ludo was sure that he would never come back . No exile ever did , not entirely . The intervening days would change everything . Whateverlay ahead would have to have its own existence , unrelated to his disappearing past . Yet , without some deeply personal link to this vanishing moment , there 'd be no point in going on at all . Janek , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spent the rest of the afternoon , all of the night , and a good part of the following morning sitting beside the first kilometermarker on the Roumanian road which led from Kuty , on the Polish side of the river , to the small Roumanian market town of Calimanesti . The day was sunny , mild . The flies were somnolent and easy to kill . The passing peasants gave them curious glances . Poland lay hidden under mist and rain as if the river were a boundary between seasons . As long as they could see that mist , the smoke of village chimneys , and the small black figures of the Russian sentries pacing the north end of the Kuty bridge , they could maintain the illu/sion that the air they breathed was still theirs and not a foreign one . None of them spoke , each had retreated deep into his thoughts , and when Ludo finally broke the silence with an oddly harsh formality and said : Ensign Toporski is n't going to join us , they stared at each other as if awakened from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auerbach.  --  God rest all of them , Papa Bettner said . The sound of village church bells came from the south on the warm , dry breeze so that , for a moment , the illusion was complete . The fat , lazy flies . The shyly grinning peasants . The barefoot children with enormous eyes . It really seemed as though the nightmare had ended.  --  Well , dammit , what are you waiting for ? Ludo said . Chief Auerbach came to attention , clicked his muddy heels , saluted.  --  Orders , sir.  --  Route step , forward . . . march ! Auerbach and Bettner picked up Ludo 's stretcher . Jacek Gemba fell in step behind them , carrying the knapsacks . The white dust of the limestone highway rose swiftly behind them and obscured the miles one by one . WHO , HAVING MADE that journey that autumn and winter , could ever forget it ? They crossed Roumania , Hungary , Yugoslavia , and Italy on foot , in wagons , on the undersides of trains . They begged for their food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they reached the French-Italian border at Modane one hundred and twenty days after leaving Warsaw . All of them were ill . It was March then , but the Alpine winds were still the winter ones , and the nights were freezing . The winter of 1939 in Europe was the fiercest since the beginning of the century and the snows were deep . For many of the hundred and twenty thousand Poles who made their way to France after the fall of Poland , spring was ap121time they 'd recall as one of mending , renewed hope and determination , and a refurbished faith in victory and return . Nothing was lost forever . Everything was yet to come . Their reconstituted government was entirely new . It was led by General Wladyslaw Sikorski , who had had no access to power before the war . The ineffectual heirs of Pilsudski , who had contributed so much to their national disaster , had been swept aside . In that alone lay much of their hope for the future . For Ludo , Bettner , Auerbach , and Jacek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary exile than a great armed camp from which they and their allies would march to free Poland . It had sustained them through months of privations . Yet when they finally stood at the top of the last of the Alpine passes , and looked into France , they were unable to move . The air was thin and icy in their lungs . The light was bright , hard-edged , as a great white moon rose above the mountains . The distances they had crossed had become a burden that pinned them to the ground . Looking down through wisps of torn cloud at the neat tourist town , with its hotels and esplanades and resorts for the tubercular rich , Ludo felt as if he had come to the edge of the world . Snow blinded him , he could n't speak . Beside him , Auerbach had sat down on an iced outcropping of limestone and clutched at his chest . Papa Bettner dropped into the snow . Ill with frostbite , the middle-aged lieutenant was convinced that he would lose both his feet as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no lies that Ludo could invent to comfort and encourage him , or to give him a reason for living.  --  Easy , easy , Papa , Auerbach tried to soothe the distraught man as they helped each other along the mountain path . You 'll be all right in a day or two . You 'll see.  --  They are going to cut off my legs , Papa Bettner said . Ludo could think of nothing he might say . He heard the words but he did n't properly understand their meaning . There was a strange , twisted feeling in his throat and belly , something  --  he realizedat once  --  that was as close to madness as he had ever gotten . Blind will drove him on , but to what ? Not life , to be sure . He had spent his life in pursuit of a moment that might illuminateall the roads he had taken , and grace them with meaning , but there had never been any clear answers . Service and duty hadp122been simple road signs . Too simple for what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Tomorrow morning , we 'll have breakfastat the Grand Hotel . There , that long white building with the balconies . Brioche and croissants . And cream in your coffee . Polished silverware.  --  And people playing on a violin ? Jacek Gemba asked  --  Oh , there 's sure to be a few of those , Ludo said.  --  Like in the Europejski ?  --  Just like in the Europejski . White tablecloths and napkins , and a waiter in a swallow-tailed coat . Flowers on the table.  --  Ah , Jacek Gemba sighed  --  Leave me here , I beg you , Papa Bettner said.  --  And then tomorrow . . . Paris , Ludo said . Paris . . . our own people around us again . Our own squadrons forming . In a month or two , we 'll have forgotten that we were ever tired . Just a few more steps down this mountain and all these months of effort will be over . Long past his limits of endurance , Papa Bettner had begun to weep , and the tears froze whitely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , he said . I 've always done my duty . But there is nothing more that I want to do . Leave me here , I beg you.  --  I ca n't do that , Ludo said.  --  Why not ? ' What difference can that make to you ? You may have some sort of a future down there , but what do I have ? I know what gangrene smells like , even in this cold . I know what 'll happen to me in a hospital . Do you want to watch me selling pencils on some damn street corner , is that it ?  --  Do n't be a fool , Papa , Ludo said.  --  It 's a bit late for that kind of advice , do n't you think ? the older man cried fiercely . You owe me something , Ludo . No matterwhat you 've asked me , no matter how terrible it was , I 've alwaysdone it , have n't I ? So will you let me do something for myselffor once ? Have n't I earned at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludo said.  --  Oh , certainly . Be quiet . Be tractable . Do what you are told . Bomb a damned village . Hang an old , mad peasant . Never questionorders . But when do I get something I can live with ?  |  --  Not on this earth , my friend , Auerbach said and sighed  --  You owe it to me , Ludo , Papa Bettner said . Leave me here and all our debts will be paid in full , I promise . There 'll be no hard feelings about anything . You 'll have done your duty as a friend . But if you take me down there , I 'll find some way to kill you , I promise you that too.  --  I thought that . . . you were done with killing ? Ludo murmuredand knelt beside the frightened , injured man , and took his hand in his own.  --  In vengeance , Papa Bettner whispered then . I 'd do it in vengeance . They brought him to his feet . The four of them clung to each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel his own tears freezing to his face.  --  I do n't want to be a cripple , Papa Bettner said . I never could stand to look at them . I 've had this phobia about crippled beggars since I was a child . What are we doing here , anyway ? What 's the point of this ? He staggered in the icy snow . He slipped and would have fallen but for the grip of Auerbach 's arms around him . He dragged his frostbitten feet in small , clumsy circles . The towering white mountains echoed his despair , and , suddenly , Ludo did n't know who he was , or where he had come from , or what he was supposedto do . His own injuries , he knew , were less a matter of the body than of the mind and spirit.  --  We 've lived in the past , a nation of cripples , Bettner went on in a plaintive whisper . And what 's it all going to mean in the end ? Just one more illusion . Then he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one war to a generation ! And this is our third ! I 'm . . . ah , God , forty-six years old . If this war lasts six years , I 'll have spent a third of my life in this murderous trade . It 's different for you , I know . You have your absolutes , your damned sense of service . May they serve you well ! May the pigeon shit lay lightly on your head when you 've become a national monument ! But what does any of that have to do with me ?  --  Easy , take it easy , Papa , Auerbach said and stroked the unnaturallypale , luminous cheeks of the frostbitten man.  --  God , how I hate winter , Bettner whispered then.  |  --  Winter 's over . It 's spring.  --  God , how I hate spring , Bettner said . They made their way down the mountain , in the harsh white light of a galloping moon . Had it been entirely up to him , Ludo thought , had he and Papa Bettner been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shocked eyes of Auerbach and Jacek , he might have complied with his old friend 's request . A man had a right to die as he wished and , in that chosen moment , to justify his life . It might have been the last gift of friendship , a way to say : Go with dignity , all of your life 's indignities notwithstanding . But they had not been alone to make such decisions . A quick , bright death was always better than a lingering one , he thought as they entered the town at the foot of the mountain . But not at the expense of duty . A cold , pale sun had risen by the time they had come to the town . It gilded the mountains . It brushed against the icicles that hung in rows from the eaves and balconies of the great hotels . It seemed to light a thousand welcomes in the windows . Indeed , lights were on everywhere . There were few signs of war in Modane . Gloomy reservists sat at coffee tables at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been spatteredwith mud . As the morning passed , as the shopkeepers rolled up their metal shutters , and as listless shoppers appeared in the streets , it seemed to Ludo as if he had come to a country where everyone had agreed to ignore the war . The crowds along the esplanades were self-absorbed , depressed . Their aura was one of hostility and rudeness.  --  It does n't seem like we 've come to the right place , sir , Jacek Gemba attempted to joke . Maybe we made a wrong turn at the last mountain ? Maybe these are Germans ? Auerbach , too ill to respond in kind , jerked a thumb toward the Tricouleur that snapped in the wind outside the mairie.  --  It 's the right place , he said . But the time is wrong . They do n't want to see our kind of tourists here . Looking around , sniffing the brisk air as if to test it for signs ofp125rot , Jacek Gemba said : They 'll see another kind if they are n't careful.  --  Parlez frangais ! a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sals polonais ! Who wants your war here ? Hungry , they went toward the Customs House , where a bored douanier muttered and snapped his fingers while they hunted in their clothes for their frayed paybooks and identification cards , and then , as if the dress uniforms on their photographs were a final , unforgivable insult , he ran out of the room and slammed the door behind him . An hour passed , then another . One of Papa Bettner 's boots had burst , and the sweet stench of gangrene filled the overheated room . The sun was scarlet in the fly-specked windows which had been nailed shut and could n't be opened . The heat , the stench , and their terrible fatigue drained the last of their strength . He had to ask himself then , as Bettner had asked : What are we doing here ? The war was in Poland . There , in that scorched charnel house where people were dying by the hundreds every day , the war made a dreadful sort of sense . Here , in this comfortablecivilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kind would be as welcome as plague-bearing vermin . Their many miles mocked him . A blue-green fly had awakened between the double windows . Its insistent buzzing brought to mind other sounds , heard in other places : the drone of aerial enginesfading in and out , the whine of a Stuka , the hiss of air in a shattered cockpit . When he closed his eyes , he could hear Kaminski 's dreadful whisper in the hospital in Warsaw , and then the trilling of the waterfowl at the river 's edge . Bettner fainted then . They made him as comfortable as they could on the floor , putting their bundled coats under his head , and Auerbach slit open the remaining boot , exposing the greenish-white , swollen flesh streaked in blue-and-scarlet . Between the windows , the fly seemed to go mad . The douanier returned , grasped his nose , and ran out again.  --  Sir ? Jacek Gemba whispered . Sir ? But Ludo could n't answer . He could neither see nor hear anything as it was . All sights and sounds had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray room revolved so that , for an icy moment , he thought that he had been shot down again and fallingp126in a spin . Warsaw burned below him , fire filled his cockpit , and he could n't find the controls that might flip the machine over on its back . A voice kept calling to him in the receding distance : Loo-do ! Loo-do ! He was aware of sadness , nothing more . In the hospital , Ludo 's collapse was total . He neither moved nor spoke . He could n't give his name . He was bathed and his wounds were probed , and his inflamed eyes were prepared for a new English process that allowed burns to heal without bandages , but the surgeons could do nothing to save his right hand . They took three of his fingers . They amputated both of Bettner 's feet . After the operations , Papa Bettner raved in a drug-induced nightmareabout the corpses of children he kept tripping over in a firebombedvillage , and Ludo vomited on the starched percale sheets , and the nursing sisters  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned their serene eyes to the crucifix on the whitetiledwall . Later that night , he awoke to deep , booming groans that he thought were his own . Bettner , as ghostly white as his sheets , was still unconscious and talking to himself in thick , strangled gasps . Later still , after the blue-gray light of dawn had brushed against the windows , he tried to murder Ludo . It was a nightmare , he thought and watched the large , round , trembling head , the huge swollen nose , the veined cheeks of the drinker straining with the effort . The mouth was open in a silent scream . Bettner had swung his legs out of bed and took three steps towardhim , a pillow in his hands , and Ludo thought : My God , he 's no bigger than a child , so fragile and wasted . . . . And then he thought : My God , he 's standing on his ankles ! In that insufficient light , the mouth was a black hole in a shining , colorless surface , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand upon agony for so many years , his rage had such logic , that this ultimate expression of his pain made considerable sense . Papa Bettner took one dreadful step after another , his amputatedbones clicking against the floor , his fingers buried in thep127pillow he clutched to his chest , and Ludo thought : At last . Finally . God be praised . As Kaminski had convinced him in the hospital in Warsaw , death by suffocation was n't particularly painful . He felt a savage joy , a thankfulness , and added his own silent scream of encouragement to Bettner 's . He waited in an ecstasy of submission : the lover at the threshold of attainment . . . but Bettner failed and fell . The women who came in the morning with buckets and mops found them like that , both apparently unconscious : Bettner face down on the floor , Ludo staring blindly at the ceiling from his sweat-soaked bed . Since Ludo was still unable to speak , he could n't be questioned . But Bettner told that story many years later . Moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base in which two Polish infantry divisions , an armored brigade , and a special brigade of mountain troops were in training , Ludo mended quickly . Discipline was the basic element of such lives as his and he accepted injury without question or complaint . One by one , he buried all his ghosts . His hard , lean body responded to the gentleness of the nursing sisters as if its collapse had been a sort of death needed before true resurrection could begin . The wounds closed and grew new coverings for themselves . His eyesight proved to be faultless , although he did take to wearing dark glasses from then on . The surgeonshad left the thumb and little finger on his right hand with which , he was sure , he 'd be able to control an aircraft in flight and press a trigger button . Some slight modifications would be needed in the cockpit of an advanced machine , where the left hand did most of the work in any event , but that was something that any skilled line chief could arrange . His inner wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle took place in those weeks of silence and recovery , a struggle between the image of his country as it was and as it ought to be . Vague notions of justice , dignity , and pride fought against obedience . It was n't enough simply to do one 's duty . One had to fight one 's country 's enemies inside as wellp128as outside its borders . Yet how was one to do that when so few people seemed to be able to see that anything was wrong ? Bettner who , Ludo realized , had served as his conscience , was gone . There was , perhaps , a lesson to be drawn from his final madness . Yet , had he been mad ? Was n't there a deep sense of remorseless logic in what he had tried ? If you hate something to such an extent that it might drive you over the borders of reason , is n't it your simple duty to oppose it ? It would be either that or a bullet in the head , and to the Devil with the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major commanding a battalion in the Mountain Brigade , brought him news of Wlada . She had vanished from the home of her husband 's uncle in Lw6w and all attempts to find her had failed . She was most likely to have been among the hundred thousand people transported to Russia , a tragic fragment of the forced exodus that had depopulatedall of eastern Poland . Janek , however , was alive . He had not been killed by the Russians on the border . The Polish undergroundorganization had released lists of officers imprisoned by the Russians in three camps named Kozyelsk , Starobyelsk , and Ostashkov , and Janek was among them.  --  To be alive is always better than to be dead , no matter where you are , Piotr said . Do n't you think ?  --  As long as there 's still something one can do.  --  He 'll be all right . Do n't worry . He might surprise us all . And ... who knows . . . I might be seeing him quicker than we think . Piotr 's brigade was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight the Russians who had invaded Finland in the winter , once the Norwegians and the Swedes had granted to the Allies transit rights across their territories.  --  Obviously , this extends the war , Piotr said . The Russians are now going to be everyone 's enemies , not just ours . But at least there wo n't be any questions now about our eastern borders.  --  I did n't know there had been any , Ludo said.  --  Not among us , of course . But our allies might have had a different idea . They guaranteed our borders , but they 've done their best to ignore the Russian invasion . I wonder why they'vep129decided to defend the Finns , when they would n't lift a finger to help us ? But it 's all coming out the way it should be.  --  The war is going to last longer , Ludo said.  --  But when it ends , there wo n't be anyone left to fight , Piotr said . We 'll go home to peace.  --  And then what ? Ludo asked  --  Well , Piotr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you , wo n't it ? General Sikorski is a man of vision and conscience . We can believe in him . The old gang is finished . There 's room now for ideas such as yours , and you wo n't even need to make a revolution.  --  It wo n't come in time to save men like Bettner , Ludo said.  --  Nothing can save men like Bettner , Piotr said . They 're doomed the day they 're born . They are what keeps the past alive , and so the past kills them.  --  And since when have you become a philosopher ?  --  Since I discovered that fixed bayonets do n't stop a Panzer division , Piotr said . Get well soon , Ludo . We need you on your feet even more than we need you in the air . His brother-in-law , Romuald Modelski , also came to see him . They had detested each other for years , but now that Ludo had become an official hero , and that political plans were being made for him , there was obvious value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think it fair , said Romuald Modelski . A man might spend years in politics , maneuvering from one position to another , and nothing extraordinary ever happens to him . And then another fellow comes out of nowhere , shoots down a few planes , escapes from a hospital , and everyone talks about him as a future leader of his country . Let me warn you about one thing , though , brother-in-law . You can get killed with words as easily as with bullets.  --  I do n't intend to get killed with anything , Ludo said.  --  Well , that 's obvious , is n't it ? Romuald said and laughed . Flow did you manage to arrange that funeral in Warsaw , anyway ? The Germans showed it all over Europe in their newsreels . Your return from the dead has made complete fools of them . Everyone in Paris is laughing about it.  |  --  A man died , Ludo said . I took his place . He took mine . That 's all there was to it.  --  Is that so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of my arrangements could come out as neatly as that.  --  Do n't envy what you do n't understand , brother-in-law , Ludo said.  --  Ah , you mean there was a price to pay ? I thought that there might be . Still , I imagine it was worth it , what ? You 've been awarded another Virtuti Militari . There 's some talk about promotingyou and a staff appointment . All of a sudden , your career looks brilliant and all it took was a Luftwaffe funeral ! Softly , then , savoring his contempt for Romuald Modelski and for everything that he represented , Ludo said : Yes . That 's all it took.  --  Who 'd think I 'd ever have anything to learn from you , brother-in-law ? said Romuald Modelski . But I suppose one must adjust , hmm ? One must try new ways . For the first time since I married Wlada , I do n't regret our family connection . I have a feeling that you and I are going to be close friends.  --  I would n't build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell ? Romuald wondered as he prepared to leave . Politics are said to be the art of the possible . ' What is possible is often dictated by the unexpected . You and I can be useful to each other in a variety of ways.  --  I doubt that , Ludo said.  --  Well , we 'll see , wo n't we ? said his brother-in-law . War is such a chaotic , disorganized business . All sorts of things can happen . The thing to do is to be able to seize an opportunity when it presents itself , and you seem to have learned that very well . You will keep in touch ? Ludo shrugged , turned his face away , said nothing . Shortly afterward , Romuald went away . In April , there was other news . The Franco-Polish-British ExpeditionaryForce had sailed for Norway . The Finnish expedition was forgotten . Norwid 's submarine , which had escaped from the landlocked Baltic in a feat of seamanship that had captured headlinesall over the world , was reported missing , overdue from patrolp131in Norwegian waters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Fjord of Narvik , was severely wounded . At the beginning of May , Ludo was discharged from the hospital . He traveled to Paris , where , in the peaceful neighborhood of the Bois de Boulogne , he went to see Papa Bettner in the psychiatrichospital to which he was confined . He sat at Bettner 's bedsidefor an hour , but neither of them spoke . What was there to say ? There was no doubt in Ludo 's mind that both of them had gone through a moment of madness . He had anticipated death with such joy that only some sort of a derangement could explain it . Bettner 's failure to kill him did n't erase that moment . There was no history of madness in his family , although who could tell ? Had his father 's lifelong optimism about human decencyand goodness been entirely sane ? Did n't his death prove that aberration ? Had Janek made a rational decision on the Roumanian border ? Did Piotr 's mild cynicism mask a darker , selfdestructivepurpose ? And how normal had Ludo been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything seemed right in the moment of an action , including the senseless , but no plans could live longer than the moment in which they were made , and no course of action made sense in retrospect . Madness , under such circumstances , he thought , was something to envy . Having drawn four months ' arrears in pay , he happened to be solvent , and he left two thousand francs with the hospital 's administrationclerks to cover whatever small luxuries Papa Bettner might want from time to time . He was aware that this was bloodmoneyof a kind , a way to ease his conscience , because he knew that he would n't come to see his friend again . Sharing a silence , and the guilt that lay within that silence , would eventually destroyall possibility of friendship . Outside , in the sun-speckled shadows of the park , where madmenwandered about on their own private journeys , he asked for directions back to the center of the city . It amused him to think that a lunatic would point out his way . Next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Polish Air Service in the Hotel Lafayette and traveled north to be a flight commander in a fighter squadron on the Belgian border . According to those who knew him at this time , he was ap132man who had begun to live entirely alone . He seemed to trust no one and to care for no one . He discouraged friendships . When he was n't flying , he took long walks in the untroubled green French springtime countryside and wrote long letters that he never mailed . It was a sort of temporary retirement from mankind , a suspension of all his human faculties but one . The French pilots of the pursuit squadron to which he was attached would describe him later as a killing machine and attributed his silent , cold ferocityto their own sentimental notions of what it meant to lose a country . He neither intellectualized nor mourned , and he rebuffed their offers of sympathy politely but firmly . By preference , becausethe high-strung argumentative snobbery of the French bored and irritated him , he spent his off-duty moments among the Hurricanepilots of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed group of English professionals , Canadian volunteers , mild-mannered innocent young university reservists , and one genuineIndian prince . They were quiet men , restrained to a fault , and embarrassed in the presence of imagined tragedies , and they did n't bother him with questions . He fought his war , which resumed when the Germans flooded into France , with a savage , single-minded fury , as if each of his aerial encounters were to be his last . In one day , he attacked an entire squadron of Bf logs , shot down three of them , and was himself shot down and wounded again , but he landed his bulletriddenDewoitine D.52o fighter safely in a pasture . He was decoratedwith the Croix de Guerre . The French surrendered before he could receive it . FRANCE FELL in eighteen days . Holland was overrun in twenty-four hours . Belgium surrendered after three days of fighting . Ten days sufficed to break the French armies in the north and the British Expeditionary Force took itself off the Continent . In June , he was on the road again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French poilus who were head/ing home . His mood was cynical and cruel as he passed the vast columns of abandoned French and British vehicles , the artillery parks full of heavy guns that had never fired a shell , and the landingfields on which French soldiers guarded rows of spotless aircraftagainst the possibility that some pilot might take one up against the Germans or fly it to England . He felt neither bewilderment nor shame among the trailing mobs of this ruined army armed with wine flasks and carved walkingsticks , for whom the fall of Poland had been supposed to buy the time to prepare a summer offensive . The French had spent three seasons huddled in their fortifications , and no order could make them fire their guns at sunbathing Germans in fear that this might cause the Germans to fire upon them . The shrug of the staff officer who had taken Ludo on a tour of the front hadbeen evocative . They 've spent ten years waving the Red Flag , the officer grimaced and said . Would you expect them to fight for the Tricouleur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been flight and surrender . Their officers , who in moments of crisis behaved like civil servants , had been the first to abandon their troops . Now the defeated armies drifted in huge , dungcoloredmasses back and forth across the central plains , and jammed the roads and bridges , and waited for someone to capture them and take them away . They had cried , Nous sommes foutus , when the first German shell whistled over their heads . La guerre est fine , they said with satisfaction now . For the first two weeks , Ludo walked south , looking for fighting men he might join or a machine he might fly . Only a quarter of French territory had been overrun when he began his march , huge armies were intact to the south of Paris , the world 's secondlargestwar fleet was yet to fire a shot , and on the African shores of the Mediterranean were all the resources of a great empire . He thought it reasonable to suppose that a second Battle of France would shortly begin . Then he was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the new French chief of state , Marshal Petain , had asked the Germans for an armistice and that all French troops everywhere were to lay down their arms at noon the next day . The date was June 22 , 1940 , and there was nowhere in France or the French possessions where Ludo might find a war.  |p134One  had to find something to remember about a day like that , he thought wryly . Dust and demoralized armies just were n't enough to mark the end of a civilization . He would remember it partly as a day on which he came to a small town where he saw old men and women attacking a platoon of Senegalese soldiers who , faithful to their warrior image of themselves , had had the temerity to construct defenses.  --  Pas de combat ! L'armistice ! La guerre est fcniel the pale , brittlevoices creaked and cracked . The stench of defeat was palpable in the crowd ; its aura was hysterical , close to joy . He would remember the black , bewildered , good-natured faces of the colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in neatly ordered ranks while the old men and women beat them with brooms and hoe handles , and only in the depths of their maroon-rimmed eyes was there a measure of dark understanding . Then , as he moved off the road into the shade of the poplars , to eat and to bathe his feet in an irrigation ditch , a large black Renault roared past him in a cloud of dust . Two German noncomssat in the front seat , three French officers sat in the back and stared fixedly ahead . He had a glimpse of pale , aristocratic faces , aloof and proud as conquerors . They were exquisitely uniformed and smoking small cigars . At once , as though its glorious civilization had never existed , France disappeared from Ludo 's consciousness . So much for La Gloire . It simply was n't there anymore for him , and he transportedhimself mentally to England , where Reszke and Gerlach were flying RAF Hurricanes , and where everyone else he knew would be heading now . Instinctively , he turned toward a rough country track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound among the sand dunes to the sea . The road ran along high coastal cliffs among gorse and bracken and , for most of the morning , he walked in its soft , furry dust , thinking that he had never seen a gentler and more placid sky , a more peaceful landscape , a more promising day . On his left , sheep grazed and distant villages trailed smoke . The sea at his right was a gently rolling blue-green turbulence that sparkled with reflected sunlight . The waves boomed among the rocks . Therep135was no wind , no clouds . There were only noisy seabirds wheeling overhead . His feet were swollen and blistered and the water in the roadsideditch was warm and thick with green slime . A diet of stale bread and apples and raw peasant wine had given him the runs . He pulled down his trousers and bared his buttocks to the road just as a long dappled column of green-and-brown British Bedfordsbegan to file past . The trucks were filled with sun-browned , singing German infantry , and he thought that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , why should n't they feel good about themselves , he thought . In fortytwodays , at the cost of twelve thousand casualties , they had eitherscattered or demolished the armies of four nations . They had taken a million prisoners and captured four countries . And last year , in September , there had been another ... . A noncom roared , Eyes left ! and the Germans cheered as he hissed and groaned . Dignity and diarrhea do n't mix very well : it was a situation to make a dead man smile . One of the laughing , shirt-sleeved Germans threw something toward him , a metal objectthat flashed in the sun , and Ludo hurled himself face down into the ditch ; then he remembered that in this country , on these roads , such objects were unlikely to explode . It was a tin of English cigarettes , fifty Gold Flakes stamped H. M. FORCES ONLY . He wished the laughing young German soldier a quick and easy death . On the beach , he stripped , swam , ate some dry bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , depleted by his journey . He viewed himself with the same cold , calculating objectivitywith which he looked at everything and everybody else . He neither blamed anyone for anything nor found excuses for them . Nothing that he had done in the ten fierce days of fighting before the Germans overran his airfield , and before his own French ground crews had immobilized the squadrons , seemed extraordinaryto him . The fall of France exasperated rather than distressedhim ; he did n't think of this disaster as his own . Another chapter of his life had closed ; it would be followed by another , and then another and another until there were no more , and eachp136of these distinctive subdivisions would tell its own story . If there was one connecting theme to these various stories , it was never again to care for any people other than his own , and never to surrender . Someone else shared his beach at a distance , a tall , thin woman in a white dress who walked at the edge of the tide , looking down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , and bare arms and legs as deeply stained by the sun as his own face and hands . A hot , swift wind came off the water and ballooned her skirt , and stirred some sort of memory in him , like an echo in a long and dark corridor that had closed behind him , but he let the image and the memory slip out of his grasp . She could have been a child or a crone , it made no difference to him . His body , flat as a stone slab laid across the mouth of a cave , was disinterested , a damaged but workable instrument at rest . He made no effort to cover himself ; there was no reason why he should . She sat for some time at the far edge of the beach , looking at the water , and he watched her only long enough to determine that she was alone , that her interest in him was minimal ( indeed , his first thought had been that she was irritated to have found him there ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost sight of her . He ate some bread . He drank the rest of his wine . The raw , red wine , the hot sun , the hiss and slap and mutterof the waves put him under quickly . He slept and dreamed of violence that he could not remember afterward . Strange fiery shapes twisted , arced , and fell . A great red heart was beating . The air through which he flew was cold and very dark . When he awoke , everything had changed . The wind had died down . The sea rolled heavily , thick as a pool of oil streaked with flames . Wide , placid , sated at this time of the year , the Bay of Biscay spread toward the disappearing sun . The scarlet disk had set both the sea and the sky on fire , and the flame leaped to the white wisps of cloud and high into the aquamarine space beyond , and shot across the water , and then sped on through dark folds of land to the somber foothills of the Pyrenees . The blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it as anguished . Then it sankp137into a deep crimson glow , as though a city were on fire beyond the horizon . The woman was gone and , for a moment , he thought that she had been part of the blue-edged darkness through which he had flown . She had the aura of an accusing ghost that would inhabit nightmares . Perhaps he had imagined her as well as the vague memory she evoked : some long lost moment of a human closeness . . . . But she was still there , at the top of the rise , a white patch sewn to the dark fabric of the night , and he looked past her in search of something dangerous . An owl hooted , quartering the fields in search of prey . He heard the thin , distant whining of a truck . She made no sound in the shadows of the trees where she waited . Her hair seemed heavier , bulkier , and he realized that she had wrapped a black knitted shawl over her head , holding the fringed ends crossed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : Who are you ? What do you want ? Her laughter was harsh , coarse , cruel as she mocked him : And what do you want ?  --  Nothing , he said and gestured down the road toward the small white town , the semicircle of silvered beach and the rows of bathing cabins there . I 'm just a soldier coming home , the gesture was supposed to say.  --  The resort is closed for this season , she said and went on laughing . I imagine the Germans will reopen the casino in a month or so . But , at the moment , it 's a crushing bore.  --  What 's the name of it ?  --  St. Jean-de-Luz , for all the good that does you.  --  What sort of a town is it ?  --  Franco-Spanish , Basque , virtuous , and dull . Little men with big strings of onions , and everything smells of sardines fried in olive oil . But it 's the last town this side of the Spanish border , very convenient for shopping in San Sebastian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus full of slightly shopworn Englishmen who 'd rather not go home . An excellent place in which to drop from sight without vanishing altogether , if you know what I mean.  --  I do n't , he said and moved to pass her , but she barred his way.  |  --  And who are you ? she said . What were you doing on my beach ?  --  I am a Basque , he said , remembering the beret he had found in a ditch , and then he grinned and shrugged because he knew that she could n't possibly believe him.  --  Certainly , she said . And I 'm the Empress Eugenie . If you 're hoping to find someone in St. Jean-de-Luz to take you to England , you 're wasting your time.  --  Why would I want to go to England ? he asked cautiously , and she laughed at him.  --  I could n't imagine . You just look and sound like the sort of Basque who 's very anxious to be in England now that war is there.  --  There 've been others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't worry . The French are amused by them . The Germans ignore them . The Spaniards catch them on the border and send them somewhere else.  --  Do you live in St. Jean-de-Luz ?  --  I live there , she said and gestured to a villa that stood behind a white wall at the turn in the road . It 's called Mon Repos . It 's really not as awful as it sounds . We could have called it HappyEnda , or some such damned thing . The expatriate English are the most vulgar people on God 's earth.  --  Are you English , then ?  --  Not to hear my relatives on the subject , she said and moved closer to him . A touch of the Gael in the old bloodstream , you know . It makes for a certain instability , for wild Irish flights of the imagination , for brooding walks by the sea . No , I do n't suppose you could call me English.  --  The Germans , he said and looked into the darkness , but she made a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Germans . The Boche is most correct in this part of the world . I do n't know where you 've come from , but you wo n't find that kind of occupation here . It 's businessas usual for the valiant French , the utmost in Teutonic understandingfor resident foreigners . You 'd hardly notice that there was a war.  --  I should have thought they 'd intern the English , Ludo said.  |  --  Why should they ? You do n't find the Churchill type of Englishman living on a remittance in St. Jean-de-Luz.  --  Is that what you 're doing here , then ? Ludo asked so that he might dismiss her as a neutral , neither someone who might offer shelter nor sell him to the Germans . Living on a . . . ah . . . remittance , was it ?  --  I live here because I want to live here , she said with a sudden hopelessness that astonished him . Let 's just say that I 'm a permanentEnglish visitor abroad.  --  Oh , so you are English , then.  --  Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or eat leeks . But I do n't suppose that means anything to you . If I were to call myself British , which I most certainly am , someone might think I was Welsh or a Scots lassie with chapped knees , and I could n't bear that . Quietly , and meaning every word of it , he asked : Are you mad ? Have you been ill ? Is that what it is ? Her laughter gurgled upward and broke on a high note and he waited , icily polite , while she wiped the tears that ran down her dark and hollow cheeks.  --  Oh , that 's wonderful , she said . That 's precious . That is priceless . That is exactly what it is  --  if you were to ask my loving relativesand my loyal friends . Are you always so wonderfully direct ?  --  It saves time , he said.  --  Oh , does it ever , she said . What sort of a Basque are you , then ? You do n't speak French fluently enough even for a Belgian . Austrians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , not a Greek , I know one when I see one . . . . Are you a Czech with a Jewish mother ? Or a Dutch general with a guilty conscience ? He took a deep breath , said : I 'm a Polish fighter pilot.  --  Well , it was close , she said . Then it was his turn to laugh until tears came . Her name was Ann , that was all she 'd tell him , and he was quite content to let it go at that . The villa was spacious , cool , furnished with a variety of delicate objects that he could never recallin detail afterward . The rooms were high-ceilinged , airy ,  |p140|paved  with coarse slabs of fieldstone over which Persian carpets had been thrown . There were untidy heaps of books and sketch pads everywhere . The ashes in the great stone fireplace had been allowed to accumulate almost to its top . All this suggested an attitudeof such careless contempt for leisure and wealth , and such a natural assumption of superiority to censure , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something else , a quality he thought plaintive , as if an attempt had been made to bury memory alive . She took him on a tour , pointing to this and that ( the view of the mountains from the balcony upstairs , a cracked clay pot with an Etruscan symbol of death and resurrection , and next to it , and treated with equal reverence , the cheapest of carved peasant objects ) . It was an eclectic collection of personal mementos that seemed pointedly to exclude such costly trappings as a camel saddleof hammered gold-and-silver she used for a footstool . Watchful , he looked for more personal acquisitions . But the only evidence of a man 's presence in the villa was of a transitory nature : a briar pipe in which the ashes had turned into stone , a disreputablehat , and a wide , Paisley tie she used to secure her bathrobe . She insisted on talking about herself in clipped , derisive terms that he would identify later as a practiced fraud . The more she loved a person , an object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found to say about it . Her words were barricades behind which she crouched like a poorly armed insurrectionist , the images she painted were artful camouflage . Yet some truth was sure to be there and , testing the strange , dark , honeyed corridors that she began to open up before him , he listened curiously to an accountingof disasters presented as a joke . There had been a marriage to a second cousin much older than herself ( a hopelessly botchedflight from the ancestral home , do n't you know , a sort of death march straight from a cold schoolroom into the even colder hellof an old man 's bed ) , followed by frantic leaps into the unknown , indiscreet attachments , scandalous behavior , recriminations , threats and ( finally ) banishment . ( It did n't go as far as the Archbishopof Canterbury , you know , but it might as well have done , for the noise that was made . ) The way she said it , it might haveall happened only the day before or , with equal disregard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a dis/graceful episode in Oxford , the Paisley tie was a memento of it . There was an Italian archeologist and a brother-in-law who lusted after her . ( That , he thought , would have been the cracked pot and the pipe . ) No , she had no plans to return to England at this moment . Everyone she knew would be in uniform . It would be a bore . St. Jean-de-Luz was a rotten sort of place , full of disastrous people  --  lecherous stockbrokers and absconding bishops , pennypinchingFrenchmen and fanny-pinching Spaniards  --  but war was hell , was it not ? Somehow one would endure ... . Some kind of plea for mercy ( he 'd have none of it ! ) hung like a thin , dark veil over everything she said . Ann 's bed was wide , hard as a monk 's pallet . An ugly , tortured Christ hung above her headboard . Her sheets were fresh and cold and smelled of the sea . Making love would n't describe what they did there , although , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached affection . They tore at each other with a savagery in which pain seemed to be the greater part of pleasure ; each deprived for too long , they were careless of the other 's needs . She , after memory had provided the cold distances needed for introspection , was loud , athletic , a profane contortionist , a crazed mount , and ( in her turn ) a rider to the hounds , a darting bird of prey , a museum of outrageous fantasies . He , lifted above the moment , focused upon the night sounds outside the open windows with a mechanical ferocity . A madwoman 's bittercries ( surely she was mad , surely a shocked , resentful world 's complaint was to be heard in all that bellowing ! ) spurred him towardcruelty , brutality , contempt ; his own uncompromising image held him back . He was fascinated by the long , twisted mouth that moved over him and that he had n't even kissed , by the dark , lean body that became a vise which threatened to crack his bones.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point . Oh , Christ in heaven , you 'll burn in hell for this.  --  And what about you ?  --  Me ? she cried . Of course me ! Who the hell do you think I 'm talking about ? Oh , Christ , lover , there ! Christ ? Lover ? The Byzantine horror on the cross had tilted towardthem.  --  Oh , damn you ! she cried . Damn you for a bitch ! Then it was over , just like that . No alarms , trumpets , imitationp142earthquakes . No great white blinding light , transcendence , transformation . She was spread out darkly as if for a crucifixion of her own , white palms turned upward and awaiting nails . He thought she was dead . They had fought their battle in the dark ; she had refused him light . Perhaps her body , which was not as young as she might have wished it , had something to do with her need for shadows and concealment . Tracing it with the fork of his maimed hand as she leaned forward in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought that the years had been kind to her , at least in one respect . Her body might be safe from fatuous eulogies , but she had no need to be ashamed of it . IIe thought that they were of an age , perhaps she was older by a year or two . Either way , it would n't make a difference . Her body was dry and cool where his was wet and hot , and she aligned herself to fit him exactly as if he were a mattress tailored to her measure : hip upon hip , knees upon his knees , the long flattenedinstep laid along his own , her sharp elbows digging into his chest , her chin in her hands . Her eyes were huge and black , deep as wells ; the whites were faintly blue . Her mass of jet-black hair made her deeply tanned olive skin seem pale . by comparison and gave her an illusion of fragility.  --  What now , bloody man ? she said.  --  Now ? Nothing , he said and took her cigarette and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched her quietly , finding pleasure in the unpredictable , watched the gradual widening of her eyes , then nodded and looked toward the windows , where the quality of the light had begun to change . Had she not pinned him down , he would have raised his head to look at the mountains.  --  It may not be as easy to get away from here as all that , she said.  --  You see yourself as some kind of Circe , then ? he said.  --  Ah , she laughed softly . The pleasures of a classical education . No , not at all , my lovely rooting hog . I had the Germans in mind , do n't you know . Not to mention the mountains.  |  --  If one ca n't go through the Germans , one can go around them.  --  You do n't seem to have done it all that well , she said and began to trace his scars with a long fingernail . And , as my countrymenhave begun to say in an attempt to limit unofficial travel , is your journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking for in England , you know.  --  Some surprises can be very pleasant , he said and grinned , and she slapped him lightly on the forehead.  --  Disappointment is the general rule , she said . One really ought to know more about the English before venturing among them.  --  So far , I 've had no reason to complain.  --  Disgusting man . Pig . Greedy hog , she said and showed her white teeth . Do n't do that unless you mean to finish the job . Anyway , the lady wants to talk.  --  Why ? What about ?  --  All sorts of things . Life , death and the frailty of dreams . What the Archbishop said to the Mother Superior . I 'd hate to think that this is no more than a sort of **27;10775;TOOLONG of interlude on your journey to bigger and better moments . A pit stop , so to speak.  --  What else can it be ?  --  Oh , come now , she said . Brutality does have limits , even for someone as primitive as a Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , he said . You waited for me.  --  Bad hog , she said in a sad-little-girl voice . Cruel hog . And a conceited hog too , it would appear . What makes you think I waited for you ?  --  You spent too many hours looking at the sea . You collect flotsam , do n't you ?  --  Ah , she said . You 've had all sorts of educations , have n't you . But then , so have I. The best that England has to offer a lady of family and station . Do n't be surprised , however , if you 're asked in your next English bed whether you had indoor plumbing in Warsawand if you eat with forks.  --  I 'll tell the lady not to talk with her mouth full , Ludo said .  --  No , wait , damn you , she said with an odd note of panic under the impatience . I do want to talk ! Call it another sort ofp144necessary hunger . . . . But why should that worry you ? What can you lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of complications , I expect . There was something about her that was very private , no matterhow impiously she offered herself . If she were lost , then she was longing to be found while hiding . Of what , or rather of whom , did she remind him ? The murky image that rose in reply was , somehow , a threat . He damned the night , the violent airs she stirred in his interior darkness . . . . Oh , shit , he thought , why the hell do they always want to talk ? As if she were able to read his mind , she said : Do n't be so bloody selfish . Your war wo n't run away . In a friendly and uncomplicatedway , the lady is trying to do you a kindness . Forewarnedis forearmed , and all that . Some friendly interest in return would n't come amiss . He did n't want to carry anything out of this moment into the next mile of his journey.  --  My interest is self-evident , I should think , he said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stayed in England , she said , sat up and straddled him and crossed her thin arms in front of her chest . Damn , but life is becoming such a bloody bore ! Had she said , during her derisive litany of disasters , something about a nervous breakdown , slashed wrists , a bottle of hydrogen peroxide ? He caught her scarred wrist between the thumb and solitary finger of his own disfigurement , pulled her down.  --  What 's the matter , he said , suddenly furious with her . Was n't the razor sharp enough ? Next time , try a cutthroat ! She pulled her wrist away , hid it against her breasts , and spat into his face . Two hectic spots of color appeared in her cheeks.  --  Scars worry you ? How droll . One suicidal maniac censuring another ! Well , well , will the lady never learn about hasty judg-ments ? She was unbelievably strong , her muscles bunched and bulged in his grasp , and it took all his strength to hold her down , to pinionher upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relaxed , unresisting.  --  Yes . Well , she said and leaned across him to drown her ciga/rette in his glass of wine . Perhaps one really ought n't to expect more than the occasional competent fuck , everything considered . Ah , well , once more into the breach and all that , then . Perhaps we can talk later . His face was wet where hers had pressed against it in the struggle , and he thought : Oh , God , not tears , not that damned blackmailwater , and he held her still and peered upward , choked by a sudden disgust with himself , but she had jerked her head aside and hid in the dark mass of her hair . The windows were full of light , day had come , and they were both exposed.  --  Listen , he said , if it 's all that important , if you 'd rather talk .. . The harsh , grating laughter mocked him as before and , unaccountably , he felt both saddened and impoverished.  --  Not to worry , laddie . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the person you 're fucking but it 's not biologically necessary . One can , as the saying goes , do without the frosting on the cake . He held himself very still . The image then was one of a dangerousanimal in ambush , scenting the air and peering into darkness where other and equally dangerous animals had begun to move . THE NECESSARY GENTLENESS and consideration of each other 's needs began the next morning , and grew in the course of the ten days Ludo spent with Ann , so that he knew that if they met again they 'd see each other as lovers rather than as mutual exploiters . In those days , Ludo searched the border for an unguarded path where French and Spanish patrols did n't wait for him and found his entry blocked at every point . Once he disguised himself as a border Basque by hanging a string of huge onions around his neck and marching through the Customs posts with a market-day mob . The French gendarmes laughed ; the grinning Spanish guar/digs slapped their thighs with their leather hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann laughed herself into a mild fit . On another morning , he climbed with smugglers along a goat trail , supposing that the guards would seek safer footing , only to find a toll collector on top of the mountain . The smugglers paid their fee and went their way ; he trudged back down into France . The Germans seemed oblivious of all this . They took care not to interfere with anyone in the early days of their occupation . They were under orders to be polite and to pay for everything they took , and to molest no one , and they provided a brass band that played Offenbach and Strauss ( both Johann and Richard ) in the pink bandstand on the beach on Saturday afternoons . The Sturm and Drang found expression much farther to the east . Hatred , always a private matter , took time to develop . The patriotismof the bourgeoisie  --  the keepers of the bars and brothels and restaurants and gift shops  --  was counted in the till . It was n't until the Germans ' Russian allies had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance . Until then , life in St. Jean-de-Luz went on as if the Germans ( les touristes , as they were called with the exquisite French touch for the proper word ) had never arrived . Yet not even such contempt as his could be universally applied . Everyone in the port , in the estaminets and bistros and the boardwalkcafes , knew who he was but no one turned him in . It was as if his journey had become their own , both a symbol and replacementof their need to climb the Pyrenees , cross hostile Spain , or grow wings and fly across the Atlantic . They listened to the Londonbroadcasts of de Gaulle , looked at each other fiercely , shrugged and bought Ludo a drink . La Patrie had never had such sons before , they could assure themselves . And then they told him about yet another path , known only to God and the mountain goats , that he 'd try the next day . The mountains . . . well , the mountains . The damned Pyrenees . Great round hills piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could neither bypass nor climb across , snow-covered passes winding among the clouds . Each morning , as he stood on Ann 's balcony and watched the sun sliding past this mocking barricade of granite , watched while the woman yawned and stretched and called him back to bed , he began to wonder if he too would spendp147the war playing dominoes in a seaside cafe , making love , and complainingabout the quality of the wine.  --  Would that be so terribly awful ? she asked on another day of his disappointment.  --  No , it would n't , he said.  --  Well , you could stay here if you like . It 's up to you , you know . It 's not as though you 'd be violating a cardinal principle , is it ? The war does n't need everyone 's involvement.  --  I 've people waiting for me in England , he explained .  --  What people ?  --  Pilots.  --  Ca n't they survive without you ?  --  It is n't a chance that I 'd like to take . They 're my pilots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me.  --  And we must never disappoint our families , must we , she observedunkindly . Tell me about your real family.  --  That 's the last thing I want to talk about , he said.  --  Try . Indulge me . Did you have brothers ? A sister ?  --  Three brothers . You might have heard of my sister . She was ... is . . . an actress . Her name is Wlada Modelska . She 's quite well known in Europe.  --  That was your sister ? Ann said and sat up to look at him carefully . Is there no end to the surprises you 've in store for me ?  --  You 've seen her ?  --  Of course . In Paris at the Comcdie Francaise . In Rome . I thought she was quite wonderful in El Ansuelo de Fenisa.  --  Yes , she was good in that.  --  Good ? She was wonderful . What was she like offstage ?  --  Is , not was , he insisted suddenly and went on swiftly to cover the onrush of grief : She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that 's the word . Loyal to those she loved , careless with people she did n't care about.  --  That could be said about any of us , Ann remarked . Still , it really is n't all that difficult to see that she is your criterion for what you think your women ought to be.  --  She may be one of the criterions , he murmured.  --  Criteria , Ann said.  |  --  Criteria , then . I 've not thought about her recently . Ann laughed and touched the side of his face , an admonitory gesture .  --  You make an awfully unsuccessful liar . But it is nice to know that you can love a woman as deeply as that . The sun was setting then . They were on the beach , and the night looked and felt exactly like the one which would define June 22 for him ever afterward . As a milestone , the fall of France meant less . The long sunset shadows had striped their naked bodiesin anarchic colors . Black-and-red , she had become a banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splintered light had illuminatedthe scars on her inner wrists . He watched her quietly and somewhat warily then . Sooner or later , with that odd , atavistic female need to know the roles of other women in his manufacture , the women in his life interrogatedhim about Wlada , as though they sensed instinctively that there could be no place for them in a life and culture such as his . They would know , of course , that there was safety in reaching out for something that must stay out of reach , that withered when you touched it . . . something that might consume their own lives if they came close to it.  --  Well ? Ann said and turned into what must have seemed an easier path to the same objective . If not about your sister , tell me about your mother.  --  Why must I tell you anything at all ? The wariness was very real then , and she could sense it , but there was a limit to how far she would retreat before any man , so she said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . affectionate , he said finally and moved to distracther . And overprotective with her children , as we Poles alwaysare.  --  Is that all ? she asked  --  What more should there be ?  --  Something human , she persisted . Something that another woman might appreciate.  --  She knew the meaning of self-denial , Ludo murmured then . She knew how to submit with grace.  --  Is that what you expect from your women ? Graceful submission ? Invisibility ? You 'll have a sad and disappointing life if you do.  |  --  I do n't expect anything , he said defensively.  --  Hope , then ? Is that what you hope for ? She had sat up , dark and edged with the red glow that crept toward them from the sea , and her long black hair fell about them both . He laughed , and the false laughter rattled in his throat like a dry pebble in a metal box . He reached across her for a cigarette , so that speech might become impossible for a moment.  --  Because if you do , you must believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then.  --  I believe in what happens . When it happens.  --  My God , Ann said and laughed . What happened to that wonderful directness ? The way you twist and turn , I sometimes wonder how any German manages to shoot you down at all.  --  They do n't very often . Ann sighed then , and pressed her lips together , and judged him quietly , and he found himself quite illogically content to be assessed . Some kind of a decision was being made about him , the skeins of his life were being taken from his hands , and he was aware of a peacefulness that he had never been able to imagine before . After a time , her hand moved to his body and began to trace invisible hieroglyphics among the scars and ridges she encounteredthere , and he was very careful not to move at all.  --  They seem to have done well enough , she said . But you are not fighting for your life just now ; you 're not under attack . You are with a woman who cares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense should allow . My bed is not a battlefield , though that 's not something that too many men have been able to understand . Ca n't you take off your armor even for a moment ?  --  I am as naked as I can be , he said quietly.  --  I do n't want to be a replacement for anyone , she said . I am not your sister . I . . . do n't think much of . . . permanent arrangements . But I think it 's possible for me to change my mind.  --  Would n't you rather keep to the safety of a life without illu-sions ?  --  I think not , she said . I think that 's really being dead without knowing it.  --  How wise of you , he mocked gently . How perceptive . Is that the word ? Perceptive ?  --  Every time you want to dodge the issue , you ask for an En/glish lesson , she said and laughed quietly . You really do n't have to hide from people who are fond of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it . It 's love , not wisdom , at least I think that it might be if given a chance . You might consider it in your lighter moments . The careful silence stretched as far as he could take it , then he asked :  --  Do you really think that there still are any choices we can make ?  --  I ca n't think of anyone who can make them for us , Ann said.  --  Someone else gave me a choice a few months ago , Ludo said . To abdicate my responsibilities . To give them what they thought they 'd earned . It may have been a kindness on my part , but I could n't do it . Harshly , as though a disfigured beggar had clutched at her wrist , Ann said : Spare us the awfulness of kindness . Spare us charity . ( And then , making her own retreat , she said mockingly to Ludo : ) Was it one of your grateful but possessive women ?  --  No . Just someone I once led to disaster in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , suddenly introspective . And how foolish of him to have followed you.  --  Well , people do things like that when they love someone , do n't they ? Or trust someone . Or when they feel that they ca n't trust themselves any longer.  --  Yes , do n't they just , she said bitterly . I do have some such memories myself . She rose and gathered up her clothes and walked toward the villa , and he watched her powerful , long stride receding up the beach . Then she vanished in the darkness and he felt relieved . His sense of purpose had a way of tilting in her presence . Their roles as each other 's interrogators , he reflected , had begun to duplicateeach other ; he was as full of questions about her as she was about him , finding every scrap of information a matter of great moment . But she had begun to defend her privacy from him as though it were the city of her birth and he , shooting his arrows out of ambush , was the barbarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was forty-one ( he had searched her papers and found her passport and was suitably astonished ) , married ( she had told him that much ) to an officer in the Indian Army who had fled from her as though she were the bearer of a plague , the daughter of a rich ( and apparently titled ) family that had brought her up to leisure , to civilization ( And to be useless in six languages , she had said ) . He knew from the people with whom he drank his fines in the port cafes that she had lived in St. Jean-de-Luz for ten years , that she disappeared for months at a time to places like Tangier , Casablanca , Fez , and the Aegean Islands , that  --  unlike all the other English in the town  --  she was not a heretic but went to Mass on Sundays , and that men in expensive cars sometimes visited her with flowers . Her sketchbooks were full of arrogant young faces : a Greek fisherman , an insolent Moroccan tout , an Italian shepherd , a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage at the sight of every one of them . Mon Repos was n't a place he 'd remember as being particularly restful . But just as his collapse in Modane and Coetquidan had brought him to a pit in which his body had been forced to mend , so here , on the gray volcanic beach , in her dark bed , in the connections with his own recessed humanity that she offered him , another and invisible process of repair was taking place . She had restored some peace to his interiorair ; he had to be grateful . ... And would it really be so bad to stay here with her ? She wanted him there , she had made that clear . Whatever it was that she found in him was , apparently , sufficient to her needs . What , then , of his own ? The war had abandoned him , not the other way around . It had taken itself across the English Channel to torment a people who had sat and watched while his own country burned on a funeral pyre they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen ; no one who had seen the Wehrmacht in Poland and France could have any doubts about that . When he got back to the villa , Ann was in bed , asleep . She slept untidily , carelessly , spread out in black-and-white and murmuringto herself . He was unable to sleep . He stood by the window in which her broken and disjointed image became superim/posed upon his own . He was mocked by mountains . The sleeve of a Persian robe that he had found and borrowed had snagged on a long splinter along the window frame and held him fast as duty . He jerked at his captive sleeve and felt a seam give way at his shoulder , but the window and its curious images held him , and he looked through her long white reflection at his own dark foreshortenedone , and icy sweat began to run into his eyes.  --  Come back to bed , lover , Ann murmured then , but he was suddenly quite certain that she was speaking to another man . They had reached that stage between sexual excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into other realms , and both of them knew it . He could leave now , and that would be that . He owed her for nothing more than a moment of forgetfulness , of unusual pleasure , of consideration and acceptancein a land of strangers . He knew that there could be no limits to his obligations as a lover , if that was what he was destined to become with this Englishwoman . If , as she implied , she had begun to fall in love with him , his privacy would become intolerableto her , and there was much that he feared to confide , even to himself . As she emerged from sleep and turned and muttered in the residueof an uneasy dream , and as the night advanced toward a troubled sunrise , he paced up and down . War , he thought , had been a much less demanding mistress . When the solution presented itself , it was so simple that he could n't understand why it had taken him so many days to find it . He suspected that , having found something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had accepted those high , cold mountain peaks as impassable because he did n't want to cross them . He had spent yet another night on a footpath above the timberline , thinking that not even goats would risk such a crossing in the dark , and he had been caught shortly after sunrise by the same bored Spanish guardias who had caught him several times before . ( The climb was easy on the Spanish side . ) This time , they took him down the mountains to Pamplona and locked him up in the municipal jail , and the gray-haired , tired Spanish cap/tain who interviewed him there gave him a choice of moving to another frontier zone or spending the war years in the Miranda concentration camp , where three thousand other Poles , caught on the border as he had been caught , were learning the art of patiencein considerable discomfort.  --  Be reasonable , amigo , the Spanish captain said . Repay my understanding with some of your own . You have become a bywordin my zone , you are bad for discipline , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a man and a Spaniard , I admire your determination . It is , of course , the manly thing to do . But as an officer responsible for eighty kilometers of this border , I ca n't have my zone turned into a joke . Go and create a problem for somebody else . Next time we catch you here , you 'll go to Miranda . I assure you that you 'll sleep less comfortablythere than you do in the bed of the beautiful Lady Hudson in St. Jean-de-Luz.  --  You 're well informed , Captain , Ludo murmured.  --  What do you expect from an officer whose job is to catch smugglers ? French tongues wag and Spanish ears listen . Take my advice and go to Perpignan.  --  The peaks above Perpignan are even taller than here , Ludo said.  --  Possibly . There is , however , a railway station at Perpignan , and trains run through tunnels . And do pay my respects to the beautiful Lady Hudson . I 've admired her , from a respectful distance , whenever she has visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Sebastian , Ludo caught a ride aboard a swaybacked produce truck , then hitchhiked , then bumped along in a lorry loaded with baskets of sardines . He was in Perpignan in the afternoon . After sunset , he reconnoitered the mouth of the tunnel , the first of several tunnels that followed each other into Spain , each with its own entrance and exit through a succession of mountains . Only the entrance to the first tunnel was guarded on the French side . It would be reasonableto suppose that the same was true on the Spanish side . The mountains here were particularly forbidding . He sold his watch to a merchant from whom he bought a thick sweater , a pair of heavy boots , a pocket compass , and a flannelp154shirt . He traded his carved walking stick for a lightweight rucksack . He took a room for the night in the hovel-home of an exiled Spanish loyalist , a grief-stricken man for whom the Pyrenees were a border between life and death , and who looked at Ludo with such naked envy that hatred would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludo found himself hitchhiking back to St. Jean-de-Luz . The mountains , then , were no longer a barrier ; even so , they mocked him , and he stared at them with a dull , dispassionate loathing , having come to the end of all the lies he could tell himself . He could no longer blame the Pyrenees for keeping him in France . The war seemed very near then ; its summons had come with exquisite timing at the exact moment when he had been ready to believe that he had no more debts to pay . Perhaps after the war there would come a time when commitment to another human being made some sense , he thought , but it would have to be a totally different world . He found Ann on the beach . He told her about the Spanish captain , the tunnels , and the plan he had begun to make . Hungary , Yugoslavia , Italy , and France itself up to the interlude in St. Jean-de-Luz had been an education in illegal journeys , so that he expected to encounter nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embassy ran a reception center for men like himself , there 'd be false passports and visas to Shanghai ( to protect Portugueseneutrality ) , and ships that formed convoys in Gibraltar and sailed to ports in Scotland.  --  So that 's that , then , she said . Her profile was sharp against the lighter backdrop of the starlit sky ; the nose was straight and long , the full , long mouth turned down at the corner . Her eyes were turned toward the sea , dark and reflective and unreadable.  --  Do n't count your borders until they are crossed , she murmured to herself , but he was not thinking of her ; he thought of Spain and Portugal and of the distances to be covered on foot , in the backs of trucks carrying vegetables to market , on the undersidesof trains , across fields and orchards.  |  --  Once before , in Modane , I thought that this journey was as good as over , he said . But this time I really believe that it 's just a matter of walking . Once I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , home , and beauty , she said bitterly  --  How can you hate your own country so much ?  --  Oh , do n't be such a fool ! she said . Of course I do n't hate it . I love it . I hate its disapproval . And . . . I ca n't be faithful to people and places I ca n't see.  --  Then why not go home ?  --  This is home ! she said fiercely . I may not like it very much , but this is where I live . Occasionally , something rather pleasant happens to me here . From time to time , I even think it might last.  --  Come to England , Ann.  --  Follow you there , you mean ? I do n't follow people . And I do n't compete with other women , wars , or occupations . If you 've found out anything about me , you ought to have discovered that much for yourself.  --  At least I 've discovered your name , he said quietly . Her laughter was short , cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun a retreat of her own , he knew , and perhaps that was just as well.  --  How fascinating for you , she said . And which name might it be ? There have been a number.  --  You 're Lady Hudson.  --  There 's no such thing , she said . It even sounds ridiculous . This kind of title is used only with the Christian name , if it is used at all . My poor , bewildered Patrick , who did his insufficient best to live up to it , had nothing to do with getting it for me . Daddy did that by selling lots of beer . You ought to learn about that sort of thing if you 're going to be a success in London.  --  There is no Lord Hudson , then ?  --  Not to the best of my knowledge . There is a Brigadier Hudson , now busy propping up the Empire somewhere near the sunrise , and there 's a hopeless , panting , balding puppy dog named W. W. Hudson , better known as Wally , who lusts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , dear loving Lord . Not evenp156such ambitious second cousins as the Hudsons could aspire to that . Who told you about the Hudsons ?  --  About you , not the Hudsons , Ludo said . You have an unknownadmirer in Pamplona.  --  Impossible , she said . My admirers always make themselves known . Not that I ever know them very long . He sighed , said : You do n't have to say things like that to me . I 've thought about you much more carefully than you know . She laughed , said : How nice to know one has had some effect . But do n't worry , lad , you 'll get over it.  --  I do n't want to get over it , Ludo said.  --  That , she said , would be making a terrible mistake . I say it as your friend , this is one lady who does n't wait for the boys to come home from the wars . Johnny comes marching home and there 's Tom and Dick and occasionally Harry , and that 's when things really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you really mean what you 're saying , dear boy . You 've found a way through your bloody mountains and now you feel obliged to make a sentimental gesture.  --  Is that what it is ?  --  It could hardly be anything else . Afterward , he would wonder now and then what would have happened if he had gone back with her to the villa . When and where would they have gone together , how would they have lived , for how long would they have been able to bear each other 's disappointedsilences . . . . It was the kind of crossroad one occasionallyreaches at the far edge of youth , the sort of point in almosteverybody 's journey that should be clearly marked : one chance , possibly the last one , for ordinary human happiness .. . and then nothing but desert for a hundred miles . He stayed behind after she left the beach . He saw the lights go on in every window of the villa , and , sometime later , he heard the growling of her little car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sky , and then he watched stars . He thought of Reszke and Gerlach and Straka and Wilchurzak and of Messerschmitts and Spitfires ,  |p157and  watched the meteors and shooting stars fall into the sea . Responsibilityfor the lives of others would call for a special and continuingruthlessness on his part . Gentleness could become a habit , and what would happen to fearlessness then ? Fearlessness , and that necessary carelessness about his own welfare , would guaranteethe others ' survival ; yet he longed for the solace of a deep emotional commitment as a replacement for the gentleness that he had discarded . Piotr . . . Norwid . . . Wlada . . . Janek . . . the names reappearedand skimmed the ripples of his memory , and he struggled against the tide of remembrance , and strove to keep his face rigid and his thoughts noncommittal so that this night  --  and all of this uneasy interlude stolen from the war  --  could continue as a barrier against future loss . When he went up to the villa , Ann had gone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had packed with obvioushaste ; her clothes were scattered through all the upstairs rooms . Tangier ? Fez ? The Greek fisherman ? The Moroccan tout ? He damned them all to hell and he was sick with bitterness and longing . But she had the last word ; she always would , he thought . She had left him a note . Her handwriting was angular , sloped , sliding off the page , slashed with erasures and spilled ink . Do n't find thelady too ill-mannered , she had written . She is simply too bored with living backward . Affection , for lack of courage to use the stronger word , is too dangerous to attempt again . It 's just too depleting in the long run , do n't you see , if it 's allowed to have any run at all . Caution IS the better part of valor , lover , so take note and heed . Ave atque vale is the cleverest thing the Romans ever said . Should he reach Lisbon , she wrote , her brother might be useful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his living as a military attache at the British Embassy . He 's a nasty , selfish , cunning little beast , not to be trusted ever  --  but employable . He takes malicious pleasure in being helpful to my discarded lovers . To his amazement , he found the note wrapped around a rosary.  |p158In  the first week of July , he went into the mountains below Perpignan , bypassed the first tunnel , dropped into the mouth of the second , and walked along the rails until he reached the last tunnel but one . Later , if forced to talk about it to the journalists , he 'd joke about flattening himself against cold , wet granite walls while express trains roared past , a hand 's breadth from his suckedinbelly , or about lying facedown in the gravel between the rails and the wheels . At the time , when he could swear that he could hear the tens of thousands of tons of earth and stone creaking overhead and settling down upon him , there was n't much to be amused about . Dead , shredded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , reminded him at each step of his folly . The cold , fresh mountain air between the tunnels made him drunk with pleasure . This journey through the underworld left him spent and stunned when he climbed into the mountains to bypass the last tunnel and the Spanish sentries at the other end . He climbed with something approaching desperation ; he could n't climb high enough , he thought , to get away from the memory of his own debilitating weakness , the sense of entrapment in the dark , enclosed environment , where it would have been so easy to lie down , surrender , admit the uselessness of the attempt , and betray his purpose . But the cold , clear roof of the mountains displayed familiar landmarks , the stars were out in their glittering millions , the wind was a well-remembered mass pressing against his face . . . and he slept in gratitude among the granite boulders , Ann 's rosary  --  that incongruous gift  --  wrapped around his fist.  |p161ANN  RETURNED to London in the first week of August . Quite unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conscious  --  she had followed Ludo 's route to England . She had driven from St. Jean-de-Luz to Lourdes in Unoccupied France , the rump state left to the French after they had made a separate peace with Hitler 's Germany , obtained the necessary Spanish transit visas on her British passport , and traveled to Portugalby train in a first-class compartment reserved to herself . She entered Spain through the same tunnels that Ludo had crossed , rode under the same mountains , supposed that she was skirting the same narrow valleys and ravines through which he had crept past the small white villages with bullet-pitted walls , and she was conscious of all of this every mile of the way . The Spanish Civil War , a fierce and recent memory in the shocked consciousness of Europe , had littered the countryside with rusting debris , and the landscape through which she traveled was only a degree more lenientthan the savage desolation through which he had come . He had inched his way at night along the dangling rails of a great wrecked bridge a hundred feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaunt skeleton hanged in the sun-drenched air on a quivering horizon . How else could he have come ? She thought of him as riding on a donkey , sharing a truck with a load of sheep , walking along the dusty tracks and clay roads , hiding in olive groves and in the winding alleys of small towns before he slipped across the far edge of the Spanish plain into Portugal . He would have waited there for the heat of the noon sun , when everyone had gone into the shade of their shuttered houses , when even the dogs had vanished . She , when asked on the Portuguese border if she had anything to declare , said : Yes . The service on this train is contemptible . The food is tasteless and the wine is corked . In Lisbon , when Derek had asked her why she had chosen this of all possible times to go Home ( England being spoken of and toasted as Home in capital letters ) , just as the air campaign overp162the Channel was coming to an end and the assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrugged and said that she had been moved to patriotism by onions ; and then she told him about Ludo 's unsuccessful masquerade on the Spanish border , and she was furious as she did so because she found her own laughter too revealing . ( Onions or garlic or whatever it was , she said in that harsh , careless , artificial voice that she used to hide depth of feeling and to mock her listeners as cruelly as herself . I mean , the wretchedman was malodorous ! So if he , with his delicate Continental nose , could make such a sacrifice just to get to England , well , I mean to say , what could a genuine Briton do ? Duty called and all that , do n't you know . ) She flew from Lisbon to Southampton on a regularly scheduled Pan American " Clipper " flying boat , having the embassy courier and his diplomatic bag for company , and she was letting herself into her brother 's Mayfair flat at just about the time that Ludo  --  gaunt , footsore , weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to wait outside the door of Derek 's Lisbon office . A shared journey ? An experience that might bind them closer ? Not quite , not by a long shot , she thought , grinning derisively at the rain-streaked windows of Derek 's apartment . He , as a story in the newspapers revealed shortly after her arrival , had stolen a Germanairliner at the Lisbon airport and flown it to Casablanca , where the Vichy French authorities had thrown him into prison . He had escaped the next day and , with the help of twenty other Polish airmen and soldiers , had liberated a six-hundred-ton coastal steamer which he had navigated to a port in Scotland . So , not quite a shared experience . Not this time , she thought and laughed without amusement and went to stare through a window at the darkening , misted grayness of Green Park . In the park , graceless young women in bulky battle dress and ammunition boots were polishing big guns . The street was lined with rubble in which flowers grew . The sky was overcast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school of whales stranded in a foggy sea , and  --  beyond them , at the edge of vision  --  a small brown humpbacked fighter plane climbed like a homesick angel . Derek 's flat was the kind that needed a coal fire in July , and she , having lived for so many years in the sun , wasp163chilled to the bone . She had become a stranger to mahogany drum tables and antimacassars , to the damp wind that whispered platitudes in the grate , to hunting prints and riding trophies and to the process of presiding over tea . The dull , dark weight of Victoriandisapproval , shot through and through with hidden passionsand perversity , hung in the mist outside Derek 's windows . Ludo , she thought , would find these institutional landscapes just as foreign as she . The face that stared back at her out of the streaked , fogged glass was tranquil enough . The great black eyes were full of exteriormotion , images , and reflections , and she saw the crabbed , foreshortened military women  --  so ugly in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maggots . The dark , unlined , youthful face framed in blue-black hair had the quality of a ceremonialmask for bitter rituals . It was a face to be shown with caution to selected viewers because its narrowed , sharp intensity was such an open challenge . The mouth was straight , long , generous , and much misunderstood , she thought ; men fell upon it as though their own lips were clenched , punishing fists . . . which struck such unmemorable blows . Ludo had promised to be something different . She was determined not to think about him , or to credit him with any part of her decision to return . Impatiently , she told herselfover and over in those first few days that she was a woman who made all her own decisions , for good or for evil , and she accepted the responsibility for the consequences . No matter what she did , she was sure , the end result would add to her collection of regrets . She was quite sure that she would n't see her accidental Polish lover again ; yet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found herself looking for his blunt , triangular face above the collar of every foreign uniform she saw in the street . London  --  even this different , nervous , wartime London  --  assaultedher with a rush of memories she had thought safely put behind . It had been both her playground and her pillory . England , or what she had schooled herself to think of as England , in turn enraged and bewildered her . Her return appalled her , and yet she could n't understand how she had managed to stay away as long as she had.  |p164My  God , she thought , eighteen bloody years ! And nothing ( except for the crushing vulgarity of a war ) had changed ! The mannered , icy beat of self-centered little lives went on as before , she was sure . The same lies were being told . Men ( and women , too ) who had been raised to Empire , to a natural assumption of superiorityover less fortunate categories of mankind , still spoke and postured on the same old stage ... . Ten years in St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in Tuscany . ( And how , she asked herself , could one be optimistic in a Tuscan village with or without an Italian lover who brought her flowers and threw fits , who was the raging antithesis of everything that was measured , mannered , tepid , and restrained . . . home , husband , hearth , and the sense of never having been alive . . . ? ) A desperate year in the Aegean Islandshad come before that , a year best not thought about in any circumstances , preceded by the isolation of her first home of exile : the white mountain villa among the lemon groves and Crusader castles perched on the green slopes of the Kyrenia Mountains , on the north coast of Cyprus , as far away from England as she could get in the Mediterranean without the need to be anything but English . She had been twenty-four before she tasted bitter lemons and knew that almonds flowered in April ! Each step thereafter took her nearer to the country she had been so determined never to see again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eighteen years ! And now she felt as though she had never left at all . On Sunday , she walked to early Mass at the Brompton Ora-I tory , but when she got to the church she found that she could n't pray . She had taken a long way around the park , making her own personal stations of the cross in the Mall , around the clubs of Mayfair , near the gilded iron gates at Hyde Park Corner ( where it had been such fun to hang policemen 's helmets ) , in Knightsbridge , and in the white cold silence of Belgravia , where she was careful to avoid her parents ' shuttered mansion . ( It had been known as Yeast Castle in her contemptuous girlhood . ) The streets were swept clean of people so early in the morning.  |p165The  pavements were immaculate , the grasses manicured and rolled , the trees were wrapped in little wire cages to discourage dogs . She passed sandbagged monuments and fortified museums and porticoes inscribed with names like Malplaquet and Balaclavaand Khartoum and Ypres , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cobbled little mews , and each step took her deeper into a picture-postcard world . At almost every step , she recalled faces and events  --  routs , balls , shimmying on marble tabletops , climbing lampposts  --  and could n't understand why she felt no part of any of it . Perhaps , she thought , that was because none of it had become a part of her . Perhaps there 's this to say about England and the English , she thought in the damp gloom of the Lady Chapel , in the smell of old stone and stale sandalwood and confessionals : that no matter how much the exteriors change , and the spaces narrow , and the possibilities dwindle , they ( we ? ) remain committed to their own survival . The rest of the world can go to hell on a haycart , but England will survive , detached and floating in space like a moon if that 's necessary , and all the English know it with absolute conviction , and all the lesser peoples ( the Germans , and the Americans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) acceptthat English evaluation of the English role because they 've no other way to explain their own endless failures . The church was full of people , mostly men in uniform . She had been away too long to realize how unusual that was for her countrymen , for whom religion was a comfortable ritual at best . But this dark , dank atmosphere was charged with emotion ; these peopleprayed as though they believed that their prayers were heard . She noted the harsh , lean faces on which lines were etched deep as saber scars , heard the precision of their Continental Latin ; their strange , foreign hymns thundered among the Gothic arches like demands . Conscious of undermining her own vanity ( But , then , these were only foreigners , after all ! ) , she put on her glasses , looked about , read the name of their obscure little nation on the sausage-shaped tabs they wore on their shoulders , and thought : How clever of us to label our allies . Once something is labeled , you do n't have to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her think of stored , addressed packages to be sent at Christmas . The habit of childhood had seated her in what had been her family pew ( the name was quite clear on the brightly polished small brass plate ) and she thought , angrily : What are they doing here ? Ca n't they read ? Up to a month ago , she had never heard of them as more than just another unknown race , living in probablyquite unsanitary ways in a distant corner of the world , and now , it appeared , she could n't get away from them . She resented the sense of being an intruder within her own past in which , unaccountably , foreign rituals were taking place . The priest cried out to God and they responded in a harsh , deep chorus , and none of them had to open a missal to do so . She began to watch them and to listen to them and to sense the pulse of their civilization , their unyielding purpose . Damn them , she whispered , and damn him too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , drawing her into commitments she had long abandoned and to faiths that had betrayed her time and time again . Such single-minded love for an intangible ideal was sheer suicide , she knew . After the service , the last soaring hymn that seemed to her more like a promise and a battle cry than a plea to heaven , the church emptied quickly and by the time she had reached the street all but a few of them were gone . She had paused on the steps because a thin , cold rain had begun to fall , and she had come without an umbrella or a coat ( having forgotten about the constant need for such things in England ) , and one of them  --  a tall , stooped man with one sleeve pinned up under his elbow  --  who had walked down toward the staff car that waited at the curb , looked back toward her in her carefully simple black silk Paris suit , and returned to ask where he might take her . Later , all sorts of foolish and unimaginative peoplewould mutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her life was full of detours , unexpected turnings , and accidentalmeetings in which she could sense the presence of a plan , a logical progression in seemingly random moments , and she knew that nothing was ever wholly a matter of chance . Oncep167something happens , as Ludo had happened to her in St. Jean-deLuz , other things must happen . Chaos , she knew , is the art of order running with equal logic in reverse . He introduced himself in the formal Continental manner as General Janusz Prus . She was familiar with the stiff little nod and simultaneous salute , the slight click of the heels , the name stated firmly as he bowed over her gloved hand , and neither of them was surprised a few moments later when she said that she had met anotherPolish officer in France and found him congenial . Once named , Ludo created a common ground for them.  --  I 've known him since he was a sixteen-year-old boy , the generalsaid . Sometimes I 've felt guilty because I cared more for him than I did for my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Suddenly pleased , the general nodded and said : I 'm very glad to meet you . Forgive my abruptness , but I 've not had much practice , lately , of talking to a woman . I 'd like to give you dinner , if that 's possible . She hesitated only for a moment , then nodded in her turn .  --  It 's possible , she said . But tea would be better.  --  Ah , tea , he said and smiled . Of course . I 've not had time to get used to the English tea  --  And I 've had all the time I want to have forgotten all about it , Ann said and laughed openly . So let 's compromise and have a lunch instead . Tuesday ?  --  Tuesday . She had lunch with Prus the next day , as well as on Tuesday . On Wednesday night , they went to hear Vera Lynn singing about a time when the lights would go on again all over the world , and had dinner in a Soho restaurant whose Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got lost in the blackout , and sat in the depths of an Underground station while antiaircraft guns cracked and boomed overhead , and talked until three o'clock in the morning . Each of them had sustained a loss , each was hungry for untrammeled human contact , each felt displaced among people who knew either not enough about them or too much . Sooner or later , Ludo would become the subject of all their conversations . Prus was an easy man to talk to , he knew how to listen , andp168she told him more about herself than she had said to anyone in years . He offered neither judgment nor advice . The distances between them narrowed imperceptibly until only the last , uncrossed boundary separated them , and she began to wonder , with regret , when that might be crossed . She had never had a reason to suppose that friendship could be possible between a man and a woman . The discovery , she admitted ruefully , had come a little late . He told her about Lala Karolewska , and just enough about himself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers , and her sense of relief was so obvious that both of them laughed . Once more , it was clear , an accidental meeting had conformed to pattern , fitting everything that had gone before , and she was pleased to take the next logical step : to let him introduce her to the tense , disciplined world of an expatriate army , a society centeredabout an ideal that did n't have to be debated to death , where she felt , in characteristic English fashion , a wrench of envy and contempt . Prus and his kind appeared to inhabit landscapes of such uncomplicated harshness as to be monastic . She could see Ludo , or what she knew of Ludo , in every one of them . Their absoluteswere simple , obvious , and unstated . No one among them intellectualized his role , or voiced complaint , or harangued the heavens to witness his distress , or showed concern about his ownsurvival . ( We 've the experience to suffer with discretion , Prus had said in his amused , self-derisive manner , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and event by event , our historyis a lesson in futility , you see . ) Such objectivity bordered upon smugness , she thought , and told him so.  --  One says such things as if they did n't matter or one would n't be able to say them at all , he said.  --  Please do n't be introspective about things , she said . It 's too painful to watch . And I do n't really believe that you 're as objectiveabout it as you try to seem.  --  Yes , you 're quite right . I 'm not at all objective about it . Caringabout what happens to my country is the only thing left to me , and our friend Ludo is very much a part of that.  --  In what respect ? she asked  --  People can trust him and follow him without asking why . Hep169looks beyond the obvious and he thinks about the things he sees . This has n't made him popular in some quarters in the past.  --  I do n't see how it could , she observed . Particularly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've not done well in Europe since our independence in 1918 , the general said . We 've made serious errors . It 's a complex question which needs some rethinking of who and what we are and what we ought to be . Ludo may suggest a new concept of Poland to the rest of us if he survives this war.  --  But do n't you need power , rank , that sort of thing , to becomea leader of a nation ? And does n't that automatically change a man ?  --  It may not , he said . It depends on how little a man wants for himself . And on his sense of duty.  --  And courage ? she asked  --  Oh , of course , courage . That is often nothing more than fear misunderstood . I 've done my best to teach Ludo the truth about courage , but he 's the sort of student who outstrips his teachers . I 've had to learn everything I know , you see . He knows as much by instinct . He is much more the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I want to spare him unnecessary disappointments.  --  Can anyone do that for anybody else ?  --  One can try , he said . There are , of course , no guarantees of success . And the guiding hand has got to be a gentle one . Then , smiling wryly , he nodded toward his pinned-up sleeve and amputated elbow.  --  I think the gentle one is the one I lost . Liking him , because he did n't make her feel like a citadel under siege , she said : I do n't see you as quite the venerable father figure , Janusz . You do n't extract a crippling price for the support you give.  --  Yes , he said with a bitterness that astonished her . One does learn that much . But not , normally , before it 's too late . Ludo could be the best kind of man if he makes the right choice at the proper time.  --  And when would that be ? she asked  --  Well , obviously , he said , smiling broadly . Before it 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loss becomes the only thingp170that he is able to feel . Before he realizes that he might have made some bitter and diminishing choices in the name of his idea of duty , and that time is running out for him , and that he 's going to spend some disappointing years staring into a shaving mirror in a lonely room . For some of us , that 's almost an occupational disease . Moved by his pained intensity , she murmured : You must have loved your Lala very much.  --  I did . But not enough , I think.  --  Was she at all like Ludo 's sister ?  --  No . They were cousins , of course , but entirely different . Lala was quieter , gentler . Her capacity for life and living were . . . inspiring . Wiada was almost totally concerned with herself . Knowing that she would hurt him , but needing to know the answer in order to complete her understanding of this man and , through him , of Ludo , she asked as gently as she could : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be said . It was n't at all inspiring.  --  Perhaps there was nothing more that she could give you , she prompted.  --  Perhaps not , he said . And perhaps she realized that I had nothing more to give to her . Still , that 's not quite the point that I 'm trying to make.  --  The point you have made , my dear , is that , thanks to her , you 've become a good man yourself , Ann said . And that you want someone , perhaps me , to do the same for Ludo . I do n't think I can do that for anyone , but that 's another story.  --  Being a good man is n't enough , he said . No more than being a good woman is enough . Something more is needed . Love , gentleness , shared expectations ... oh , just the ordinary human happiness , or what passes for it . . . that is , essentially , selfish . Good people are selfish , you know . They must be , to survive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of sacrifice for something greater than himself , and that 's still the criterion for the best kind of man . You wish him that ? she asked . I thought you cared for him .  --  More than I do for myself , that 's certain , the general said . I want him to be useful to more than just his friends.  |  --  And what does he want ?  --  It does n't matter what he wants , the general said and shrugged , and she had another sort of vision of him and of Ludo and , perhaps , of herself as well . Such lives are too useful to be left to chance , he finished abruptly . She found herself repelled by the charming yet austere faces that surrounded her in this transplanted Poland , which , she suspected , had been neither as ingenuous nor as stalwart before its displacement . Was there no end to these unmitigated gallants ? she asked herself . Did they breed like mosquitoes in the bloodstainedPolish soil ? They seemed to live their lives as if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstatic immolationas their right , their part in the bloody pageant of their country'shistory . Turned from their courses , robbed of their vision of themselves as men who were free to choose their last moment , they 'd have no more peace than unhallowed ghosts . It was easier to find them fascinating than convincing , like a book written about something that did n't really touch the core of one 's being , still easier to read their little labels and take them as reported in the popular press . They had brought a savage determination to the air war that still hung in the balance . Their pilots swung into battle with skill and enthusiasm that were beyond praise . Their contempt for death had made them the heroes of this British hour . Any thought beyond such skin-deep journalistic phrases might take her farther than she wished to go . Even so , she found their faiths infectious . She wanted to ignore them , but there was no way to do that in England in those days . Of the three thousand and eighty RAF fighter pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans , five hundred and thirty-seven were foreign volunteers . Of these , one hundred and forty-seven were Poles , one hundredand one were New Zealanders , ninety-four were Canadians , eighty-seven were Czechs , twenty-nine were Belgians , twenty-two came from South Africa , and another twenty-two from Australia , fourteen were Frenchmen , ten came from the Irish Republic , seven were citizens of the United States , two came from Rhodesia , and one each came from Jamaica and from Palestine . Of allp172of them , the Poles were the most numerous , the most successful in the air , and the most admired ; one would have had to be blind as well as deaf to pretend that they did n't exist . Thinking herself at least half in love with one of them , and fond of another , Ann found herself judging others according to their uncompromising standards . These were too cruel even for her , she thought . When she was not with Prus , she sat in the stuffy gloom of Derek 's fiat , in what could have been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal and dusty carpeting and polished brass and old wood and leather and ( in her own mocking terminology ) surreptitioussin , and watched the sudden gleams and flashes in the thick gray night and cursed her involvement . The thought of spending all her nights alone  --  while the bright geometry of the searchlight beams formed orderly cones in the London sky , and the guns boomed and cracked , and the windows turned themselves into tuning forks  --  had become as distressing as the companyof the displaced Poles . August was half over before she faced the facts of her return to London , not to some temporary and imaginary Warsaw , and she realized that she had made no attempt to contact anyone she knew , neither her family nor her former friends . She had never had much retrospective mercy for herself , and now she recoiled from an unreasonable hope that she was about to discover some special meaning in her unplanned return . For her , this war was awful , cruel , full of contradiction and futility ; she would resurrect none of her old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . For the Poles , the war was a Crusade , their reason for being . The intensity of their commitment made her think of armoredmonks , and she needed neither a new faith , nor an Order , nor a new Grand Master . They were a false start to her new life in England . Then came a night in which loneliness and surroundings which were both foreign and familiar resurrected her most detested memories  --  the Oxford years from which she had thought herself reasonably safe . She listened to the thin distant wail of an air raid siren out toward the East End and knew that others would follow near , and very soon , and then she heard the tinny droning of an engine in the clouds . ( Ah , he 'd hardly have had time to reach England , far less the London sky , she thought . ) And if there'sp173one thing I do n't need at this of all times , she told her blurred and darkening reflection in the rain-streaked window , it 's another single-minded hero . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cocktail lounge which she had been careful to avoid , and she went there that night to exorcise her ghosts . Outside , the air trembled to a distant air raid , the heaviest since her return . It seemed unreal , something that could n't touch her or anyone she knew . She was aware , as most people seemed to be aware , that this Battle of Britain , which had begun to capture the imagination of the Western world as no stand had done since the fall of the Spartans at Thermopylae , was a creation of WinstonChurchill 's brilliant rhetoric , yet the danger was a mortal one nonetheless . No such thing had been planned by the Germans , who had simply wanted a campaign of attrition that might destroy the Fighter Command of the Royal Air Force , give them mastery of the air over the English Channel , perhaps provide an opportunity for a cross-Channel invasion , and , above all , convince the English politicians that Britain , with her armies wrecked in France and her lifelines threatened , could n't hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One did n't have to know how to read the headlines to see that Britain 's fall appeared imminent . The Germans were so sure of it that they demobilized some of their reserves , and plans to move the Royal Family to Canada failed only because King George VI refused to leave London . In the debacle before Dunkirk , as Prus and his friends had revealed , the Germans captured five hundred British tanks , twelve hundred pieces of artillery , thirteen thousand motor vehicles , and one hundred thousand rifles and machine guns . The RAF lost nine hundred and fifty-nine machines in forty-two days of fighting over northern France , Holland , Belgium , and the English Channel , among them five hundred and nine fighter planes needed for the defense of the British Isles . Another sixty-six were destroyed in Norway . Four hundred and thirty-five RAF pilots were either killed or captured . British merchant shipping was going down at such a desperate rate that all of it would be sunk by the spring of 1941 unless the neutral United States could be induced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armament and supply . In Churchill 's view , it was essential to convince the American Congress that Britain had not been defeated in the fall of France ,  |p174that  this destruction of the Allies in the West was nothing more than an opening battle , and that the serious business of resisting Germans had scarcely begun . If the young fighter pilots of the RAF could stay alive long enough to force the Luftwaffe into a retreat , this would show the world that the needed massive Americanhelp in ships , money , new weapons , and foodstuffs  --  without which Britain would n't last a year  --  would not merely add to Hitler 's stores of booty . The great air battles of September were yet to be fought , but people , if they talked about the war at all , no longer damned fighter pilots for their supposed invisibility at Dunkirk . They had already become the heroes of the hour which , in Churchill 's phrase , would be Britain 's finest . Looking at a little gathering of pilots at the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleeting touch of pity . How young they are , she thought , how ... untried . The self-conscious boy who had moved to the seat beside hers had obviously made some sort of bet with his grinning friends . He was n't much more than a uniformed child but to be with someone was not to be alone , and so she brought him back with her to the flat . In the flat , she stood before the windows , looking out , while he settled himself nervously in Derek 's overstuffed armchair . Normally , Green Park would n't have been visible from these windows . There had been several small streets and mews between Park Lane and this part of Mayfair , but a Dornier filled with aerial mines had fallen there in July and now she had a view.  --  I say , this is so terribly decent of you , the young pilot said , and she replied with an edge of bitterness in her voice : Decency has nothing to do with it , dear boy . Be a dependable child and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it ? he asked with false bravado . He had jumped to his feet and now peered about among Derek 's trophies , bric-a-brac , Chinese cabinets , lacquered oriental boxes , Persian slippers , hookahs in which nothing more insidious than Player 's Navy Cut tobacco had ever been smoked , stuffed hunting dogs , and wastebaskets fashioned from the feet of large thick-skinned animals . There was a film of dust over everything , and she did n't know his name , and she thought that it was proba/bly best that way . There could be courage in anonymity , a form of grace in submission to the inevitable disappointment , kindness within oblivion.  --  Damned if I know , she said harshly , destroying the moment . This is n't my flat . But my brother is sure to have whiskey here for his large naval friends . When he says , Bottoms up , he means it , if you know what I mean . The young man turned beet-red to the roots of his overlong sandy hair , and blinked soft shocked eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same persuasion , would you ? Do n't worry , I 'm not overly critical about that sort of thing . I 've spent years among people who think that a vegetarian is some sort of pervert.  --  No , of course I 'm not ! he said , then blurted on : Would I 've come with you if I were a homo ?  --  Why did you come ?  --  You asked me and I came , that 's all.  --  How very polite of you , Ann said and laughed and listened to the sudden crash and clatter of the guns worked in the park by the graceless young military women : the shopgirls and the counter clerks and the milliners ' assistants who had never made a sound of their own before . In truth , she thought , nothing appeared to have changed for her , each of her moments was stale with too much rehearsal , but everything was different for everyone else . She shuddered and the young man was immediately solicitous.  --  Are you cold ? Shall I look for a wrap ?  --  A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with that country saying . I think I 've just looked into a future in which there 'll be no place for me at all . He had found the whiskey , filled a glass.  --  This 'll help , I think.  --  It never has before , she reflected . I really ca n't see why it should make such an enormous difference now . He laughed uneasily , said : In the squadron , we drink to the last man to die.  --  How romantic of you . But I think that he must have done that quite some time ago.  --  I . . . beh-beh-beg your pardon ?  |  --  Forgive the lady 's lack of appreciation for schoolboy heroics . Romantic gestures seem rather empty after a time , you see . One faces the facts of one 's own life , after a certain age . One eschews illusions . Living among Frenchmen for ten years does knock one 's nonpragmatic imperatives into a cocked hat , so to speak . Yet there remains a sort of aftertaste of hope , a will-o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own experience . It 's all rather disheartening , if you know what I mean.  --  I 'm afraid I do n't .. .  --  Of course not . Why should you ? The lady is talking to herself , I regret to say . Quite as unhappy with herself as she was with the young man 's accidental company , she darted from one set of accents to another , from the idiom and gesture of sculleries to the brittle brightness of Swiss schools , and the young pilot was suitably bewildered.  --  I beh-beg your pardon ?  --  Nothing to do with you , dear boy . I was thinking of another pilot . He , at least , had the seasoning to rise to the demands of my more difficult moments . And like all men , he 's never there when needed the most.  --  I say now , give us a chance , what ? the young man said and she laughed openly.  --  Not today , my friend . One should n't expect a boy to do a man 's job , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Well , now , look here . . . , he said and she laughed and winked at him and patted his knee.  --  No reason to be upset , dear boy . It 's nothing personal . What I am saying is that sooner or later one stops living other people 's dreams . One accepts the premise of inevitable disaster in all relationships . One knows , in the way that a priest knows his God , that the imponderable mystery behind every door is a solid brick wall . One does not , in any circumstances , attempt to turn back clocks.  --  I fa-fa-fail to see . . . , the young man began and she nodded , said : One can believe that a Number Twenty-four bus will take one down Oxford Street to Tottenham Court Road , but one need not believe that it will be driven by the Easter Bunny . It 's quitep177simple , really . It 's astonishing how many otherwise intelligent peoplecontinue to delude themselves in the most absurd ways . He had gotten to his feet and glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of a well-brought-up young man who understands nothing : Oh , quite . Of course . Well ...  --  Leaving so soon ? she said . Well , the air raid does seem to be over.  --  I had n't meant . . , he began , and she gestured toward the whiskey decanter and he refilled her glass.  --  Not to worry , lad . I 'm sure there 's still someone at the Dorchester . It 's not very late.  --  It 's just that I 've to be back on station by tomorrow night , you see , the young man said . And . . . ah . . . one never knows when there 'll be another spot of leave .. .  --  And one does have to do one 's bit for civilian morale , she said . Poke the old home fires , and all that . Yes . Well . I did have a similar idea earlier in the evening . But then something happenedand the idea did n't seem quite proper.  --  If I said something . . . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly : No , no , you said nothing . You said nothing at all . Perhaps that 's the trouble . Perhaps it 's just that I 've been stricken by conscience , suddenly  --  Ah , he said as though he had arrived once more in familiar country : So that 's it ? You have a husband serving in the Forces ? Well , yes , I can see how that would make things uncomfortable for you.  --  It 's not that kind of conscience , she said . It 's just that there are some things that not even a patriotic Englishwoman should do for her country , and that 's bedding with a little boy who might very well be dead day after tomorrow . That 's sort of like robbing the cradle and the grave in one ghastly gesture , do n't you think ? Pale , wide-eyed , spilling whiskey on Derek 's Persian carpet , the young man made a strangled sound , and then his face filled with blood.  --  Wha-a-at ?  --  Sorry to hurt your feelings , and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , wounded and wanting to inflict a terrible injury in return.  --  G-good Christ but you 're a bitch !  --  I 've never denied it.  --  Do you hate men , is that it ? Are you some kind of pervert , like your stinking brother ?  --  Heaven preserve us from anything so gruesome , she said and walked to the windows and pushed aside the velvet portieres that concealed the night . Having loved an Italian , having lived among Greeks , Spaniards , fierce Basques , and venomous Moroccans , she fully expected the young pilot to throw her through the window . But he had broken down . He vomited into Derek 's elephant 's foot wastebasket and wept . She spent the rest of the night sitting on the floor before a pale coal fire while he slept with his head on her lap . Why , in God 's name , had she done it ? What bloody-minded self-destructive impulse had driven her to this pathetic confrontation with herself ? I simply must stop thinking about the past , she told herself that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantomswere n't to be dispersed without a special effort . In the last week of August , as the Battle of Britain reached its critical stage , she departed London without leaving word for anyoneand traveled to Scotland . She had no idea when she might be back . WID ; NEVER ANYONE asked Ann to describe her home , she said that it was an inhabitable space where she could be unnoticed , or at least ignored , and where she could hope to be more or less unaware of herself . Bellancourt was a large , square building with two uneven wings drafted as an afterthought , a lodge , a long , low garage in which the previous owners had kept sheep for some three hundred years , a perpetually drowned tennis court , and many climbing paths that led into the foothills of the Scottishp179Highlands . It stood dead center in one thousand acres of gorse , sloped heather , long-needled pine , and mist . It possessed neither lawns , box hedges , mazes , formal gardens , rookeries , or roses , grace , beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes of England 's noble rich . Since England lay several hundred miles to the south , this was n't particularly surprising . In the train , in the dispiriting night-long stench of cheap cigarettes and uniformed men and women , she thought that perhaps she ought to do something connected with the war . Slacker had become a term as abusive as Conshie had been in the First World War . But what to do and how to go about it ? Driving an admiral 's limousine seemed like a remarkably small sacrifice to preserve the British way of life . So did the shuffling of medical reportsand inspecting bedpans . She could n't imagine herself stampingaround an antiaircraft gun in ammunition boots or polishing a searchlight , yet these were all minor acts of faith that called for compliance . In moments of real crisis , she knew by experience , one tends to cling to old cliches like an infant monkey to its mother 's coat , yet the image of the time was a persuasive one : the armies of the Hun were poised to spring across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done about that . In truth , the situation was nearing disaster . No one who lived in England at the end of August doubted that a great crisis was at hand . No matter how it was conceived , or when it began , the Battle of Britain had become a very real struggle for Britain 's survival , bought with the lives of five hundred and twenty fighter pilots of many nationalities who died at the rate of about one hundred and seventy-five a month . It moved , almost by its own volition , from one of four distinct phases to another , so that the several separate but overlapping campaigns were thought of as one , and each of these was a step toward a final dramatic denouement . Yet what could this be , other than defeat ? Enslavement within those new Dark Ages that Winston Churchill had spoken of in June ? The six-week German Kanalkampf against British coastal convoys in the English Channel had strained the RAF 's Fighter Command to dangerous limits . One hundred of the RAF 's ablest fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bravep180young replacements fell out of the sky in dozens every day . BetweenJuly i and August II , one hundred and twenty-four RAF machines were destroyed in the air and sixty-two in accidents on the ground . In the next twelve days , forty-four machines crashed when their worn-out pilots made mistakes on takeoff , and another hundred and thirty-five were shot down in combat . German bomber losses had been higher than those of British fighters from the start , but now the gap was beginning to close . Suddenly , the Luftwaffe 's commanders saw a real chance to destroy the RAF 's ability to resist , to gain control of the air above Britain 's harbors , industrial centers , factories , and cities , and so to begin the process with which the waiting world had become so terribly familiar : the merciless and systematic German pounding of a helpless enemy into dust . They launched an all-out air offensive against radar stations , attempting to blind Britain . They attacked fighter airfields , giving the pilots and ground crews no rest . In the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few RAF stations in England were attacked and many were wrecked . The radar chain that controlledBritish fighter tactics was pierced and disrupted at several points . Waves of German bombers droned in the English skies under the steel umbrella of massed Messerschmitts , and the fabricof defense began to crack . Yet no one , Ann least of all , would voice the thought that there might be wisdom in making peace with Hitler . Indeed , she thought , strangely moved and determined that none of her pride would show , the best way to guarantee a British victory is to assume that Englishmen are willing to surrender . Scratch an Englishman ( or woman , she supposed ) and under the lacquer of bland self-concern and cultivated unimportance you 'll find a raging patriot every time . She thought that the discomfort of the train jammed with men and women in khaki and two shades of blue , the stench of unwashed bodies , sweated wool , stale beer , and uneasy dreams , was small penance for years of nationalindifference . Her own sins of omission called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable guests would go a longer way toward settling her accounts with the unforgiving islandgods . No one who lacked a talent for self-entertainment everp181came to Bellancourt more than twice , unless their incomes depended upon it . What usually happened there was that everyone wandered alone in the round , sheep-infested hills , and then drank tea or malt whiskey at appropriate hours . The women sat in one of severaldrawing rooms and chatted about friends who had n't come down for that particular weekend  --  a euphemism , since the distanceinvolved in traveling from London required at least a fortnightfor the visit . The men fired shotguns at small birds , played billiards , smoked cigars , and talked about the varieties of weather to be found elsewhere . On rare occasions , Ann would find an embitteredally wandering around the paneled stone galleries and hallways , but , most of the time , she could count on being quite alone . Her parents had n't spoken to each other in Ann 's memory , so that she could believe they might not even notice she was there . Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a mistake . Involvement in the lives of others had always been a trap , the more dangerous if there were foreigners about . Coming back to Bellancourt was probably no different . Time will tell , she murmured to herself while renting a car that might take her the last twenty miles north of Aberdeen . And then she shrugged and assumed her most contemptuous expression because time , judged in her own experience , seldom told her anything except I told you so . Ann arrived in time for dinner . The journey had been a dreadfultwenty hours . The train had stopped twice in open fields while Midlands cities were bombed in the night , and then it was shunted into sidings while troop trains crawled past , and then there were the hours in Crewe while police and Home Guards came aboard to inspect ration books and identity cards in search of German spies . Some Norwegian sailors , a Czech pilot , and an Irish nun had had a particularly difficult time of it , she remembered . She felt tired , clammy , gritty-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot bath , a little food , and a good night 's sleep , but that was not the way that things were done atp182Bellancourt . The food was Scottish and deplorable : broth in which mutton had been boiled , a few bony victims of that morning'sshooting , then the mutton , carrots , and potatoes , then little cups of custard and blancmange . Her father and his friends sat at one end of the long refectory table , her mother and the women sat behind a barricade of candlesticks and artificial flowers at the other . Ann , a latecomer for whom no seating plans had been made , sat midway between the male and the female contingents , with Wally Hudson , her brother-in-law , at her left , and Mrs. Smallwood , her mother 's transplanted Canadian crony , at her right . Derek , recently returned from Lisbon , sat across the table between Mr. and Mrs. Yellowstone , whom she particularly disliked . Originally Hungarian , they had made themselves more Englishthan the King James Bible and seemed to live in permanent fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor a surprise , and she watched and listened to John Laidlaw at her father 's end of the table with the confused feelings of one experiencing a familiar nightmare . In moments , the carefully stacked barricades of the years turned to rubble and she was  --  once again  --  at Oxford , a willing and fascinatedvictim of his manipulations , confiding in him as though he were a benevolent confessor ( as well as her lover ) , while he arrangedthe destruction of one young idealist after another . The Oxford images evoked by this ruthless politician , now surprisinglya Minister of the Crown , were those of noisy young men determined not to get killed in another war , and of some determinedlyintelligent young women who trooped through John Laidlaw 's rooms like the changing of the Palace Guard . They were too young and confused to know whether they were being loyal or disloyal , idealistic or subversive . Their communism was all the more fanatical because it was unschooled . Laidlaw , whom all of them had trusted as the only tutor who took his humanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that it had become important to her to remember them as noble and betrayed rather than as merely naive . Now , listening to Laidlaw once again , watching the bland , self-assured face , she felt as though she were reliving a disaster.  --  What is he doing here ? she hissed , and Wally Hudson , who ,  |p183along  with Derek , worked for a committee chaired by Laidlaw at the Foreign Office , gave her an odd , hooded glance as he said :  --  It 's official business , I expect.  --  Who 's he going to drive to suicide here ? Cautiously , as if an attack upon his superior were a direct threat to himself , Hudson said : Are n't you being a little extreme ?  --  Yes , she snapped . There was a boy at college who found him extreme.  --  Shepperton , he named the first of her lovers . Gerald Shepperton . I remember the case . Shocking thing , of course.  --  Oh , quite , Ann said . Shocking . Terribly awkward for Mr. Laidlaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerry Sheppertonto have hanged himself on his own Paisley tie , do n't you think ? How do you suppose he ever thought of that ?  --  You should n't . . . ah . . . dwell on that sort of thing , Ann , Wally Hudson said . It was all so many years ago.  --  And time cancels crime , does it ? The years absolve us all ? The trouble with idealism , cousin , is that some poor fool invariablybelieves the rhetoric . And then things get awkward for everyone . Everything works well enough if one remains a cynic.  --  Oh , quite , of course , Hudson said uneasily.  --  Yes . Quite . Well , there 's not much to be done about it now , I expect . Spilled milk , and all that . I 'm sure that Mr. Laidlaw did n't worry about it overlong.  --  Perhaps one should be careful in picking one 's ideals , Wally Hudson offered , and she could no longer conceal her contempt .  --  Like one 's love affairs ?  --  I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann ? he retreated . Grinning as if her sanity depended upon it , Ann said : Well , I would . In detail . And that includes confusing physical attraction with those so-called spiritual values . One can delude oneself very nicely until people start hanging themselves on their Paisley neckties , just because they 've been betrayed by their best friends and lovers . That 's when things get awkward for everyone . Not much fun , you see , making love or college revolutions when things get that awkward.  --  I 'm sorry , Ann , Hudson muttered humbly.  |  --  Why should you be ? I never gave you a Paisley tie for Christmas . It was no better at her father 's end of the dinner table , where politics , finance , the economics of war , and the great air battles over southern England were being discussed . RAF Spitfires and Hurricanes had shot down thirty-five Messerschmitts earlier in the day , for a loss of thirty , and Mr. Yellowstone was moved to exclaim : Ours ?  --  No , Cousin Wally muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hudson ! Are those the proper sentiments for a member of an inter-Allied liaison commit-tee ?  --  One can work with the foreign beggars , Minister , Cousin Wally murmured . One does n't have to like them.  --  Quite right , said Ann 's father . Exactly . Ca n't see what good they 'll do us anyway . I mean , look at the damn Frogs . But we ca n't very well leave them to the Huns either , what ? That 's not the British way.  --  Actually , some of them are quite useful at the moment , John Laidlaw said . The Prime Minister is delighted with them.  --  Winston likes them ? Ann 's father said , astonished . Whyever would he do that ? The man 's English to the core , for all that damned American blood in his veins.  --  Fighter Command has more than five hundred of them , including the colonials , and they 're all good pilots.  --  Foreigners ? Colonials ? Ann 's father voiced the evident dismayof the Smallwoods and the Yellowstones . Whatever can Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , said John Laidlaw . It is all rather touch and go at the moment , I 'm afraid.  --  Touch and balderdash ! Ann 's father exploded . Our chaps are beating the pants off the Hun and you know it , Laidlaw.  --  Not quite , sir , I 'm afraid , Laidlaw said . We keep this sort of news from the journalists , but I 've toured fighter stations where terrified ground crews huddled in their shelters and forced the pilots to fuel and rearm their own machines during air attacks . The Hurricanes and Spitfires climb into battle among fallingp185bombs and return to wreckage . It 's all going to be a rather closerunthing.  --  You really should n't be spreading despondency and gloom , John , Lord Bellancourt said . I mean , that is n't going to help much , is it ? No , I should think that 's the last thing we need.  --  Sorry , sir , said the Minister . But it is rather a good idea to face unpleasant realities now and then , otherwise they might overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I heard Air Vice Marshal Keith Park , who commands the fighter sector that 's defending London , say the same thing to Churchill . I had gone with the Prime Minister to a briefing at Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding 's Fighter Command headquarters . The PM , who hates Dowding for refusing to waste all of his hoarded Hurricanes in the defense of France , attempted to humiliatehim by speaking only to his subordinate , Park , and he was quite sarcastic when he asked when reserve squadrons might be sent up to stem the German onslaught . We have none , Park said simply and , for the first time since any of us have known him , Churchill was lost for words.  --  Well , that 's not our fault , Minister , said Mr. Yellowstone who , having been the treasurer of the Bellancourt interests , had now become a moving force in the Ministry of Aircraft Production . We 're keeping up our end of it . The assembly lines are matching the attrition rate quite well.  --  In aircraft , certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Unfortunately , we ca n't manufactureexperienced fighter pilots in quite the same way . Our own chaps are deathly tired . Some of them have been flying six sorties a day since the first of July . Eighty of Dowding 's best squadron and flight leaders are gone . His new men are going up against the Messerschmitts with twenty hours of Spitfires in their logbooks , and they 're getting knocked down in their first fight . What 's happened , you see , is that Goering 's got our fighters into a meatgrinderbattle that only he can win . According to Dowding 's projections , his Fighter Command has only six weeks of life left at most.  --  Damn the tricky Continental swine , Ann 's father said , and Mr. Yellowstone coughed into his napkin.  --  Trust the Hun not to play it fair , Cousin Wally murmuredp186in the sudden silence , and Ann looked at him with mild , appreciativesurprise . She wished that she could like him , as he probably deserved to be liked , and she thought that she might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had grayed and narrowed since she had seen him last . His mild eyes had darkened . The diffidence of his earlier years had resolved itself into mere patience , and he appeared to have become the sort of man for whom compromise was a duty . She knew the kind well . Sooner or later , almost everyoneshe knew became resigned to smallness and defeat and to the little daily treasons that sapped whatever youthful vision of themselvesthey ever might have had . His life , she thought , had becomea day-by-day retreat . She thought him incapable of either outrage or real devotion ; he 'd be committed to nothing more than his own survival . Time had passed , the dusk of evening had turned into night . There was a smell of rooks and old chimneys in the high-ceilinged room . Like Britain herself , she supposed , this cold room had the unfinished elegance of a place where people lived slightly beyond their means . The rich Turkish carpet showed unraveling threads ; a maid had missed a crumpled theater program under the credenza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits of Neville Chamberlain and some of her father 's other discredited political associates had been taken down . Some small pieces were missing from the chandelier . Fearing Laidlaw , or perhaps detesting her own contempt for weakness , she could admit to fascination with his subtle exercise of power , and she contrasted Hudson 's troubled silences with the peremptory self-confidence of the stronger man . Yet she did n't want to judge her cousin harshly ; she remembered his many attempts to render her a kindness.  --  Sarcasm ? she said softly . I would n't have expected it of you , Wally . You 've been changing on me , have you ?  --  In some things , I have n't , he muttered within his unsuccessfulmilitary moustache , and Ann , conscious of Mrs. Smallwood 's ears and Derek 's fixed grin , said rapidly : Oh , for God 's sake , hang it up , will you ? I 'm not your damned retirement policy.  |  --  I 've never thought of you as that , Ann , Hudson said.  --  Well , stop thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen , will you understand ? He ducked his head , blinked rapidly , and bowed over his food , and she thought with wry self-contempt that things had n't changed since her Oxford days as much as she had hoped . She was still arrogant , still terribly injured . People were still getting hurt when she was around . She had loved neither Shepperton nor Laidlaw . She had barely begun to learn how to love herself.  --  Ah , Hudson said then with that bitter and superior air that she loathed in all other Englishmen she knew . You 've some other bloody little Continental on the string ? As always ?  --  Dozens of them , of course , she snapped while Derek grinned derisively across the dinner table . As always . What did you ex-pect ? In that odd , coincidental way that turns several private and seemingly unrelated conversations into one , Mr. Yellowstone cried out at that moment : But we 've been knocking ' em down in dozens every day ! How long can Goering keep up his fighter losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as all that , John Laidlaw said . What 's not generally known is that most RAF victoriesin the last six weeks have been against lone reconnaissance machines and unescorted bombers . Whenever we 've come up against massed Messerschmitts , we 've generally gotten the worse of it.  --  That 's damn disloyal , John ! said Ann 's father . I 'm surprised at you . I 'm sure that you 're not speaking for Winston at this moment.  --  Indeed I am , sir , the Minister said . Say what you like , our foreign volunteers are damn important to us now . For some of them , like the Poles , this is their third war against the Messerschmittsand they know their business.  --  Poles ? cried Ann 's father . What the devil would Poles know about machinery ? They still think that the fastest thing on earth is a horse ! Is n't that so , Hudson ? You know them , you 've learned that dreadful language of theirs , which , I must say , is going a bit far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're doing quite well in the air , sir , Cousinp188Wally said . They think themselves superior to machines , they 're not awed by mechanical limitations , so they get more out of their equipment than anyone else . And was it her imagination , then , that Laidlaw looked at her as he said , softly but with authority : They 're something of a godsendto us at the moment.  --  Only if you assume that God has a curiously perverted sense of humor , Mr. Yellowstone said unpleasantly , and Derek laughed and winked knowingly at Ann . A godsend ? That seemed a bit much , yet she had begun to think of Ludo as somehow providential . Why else should a man born in one part of the world , designed and raised to function in one specific set of cultural circumstances , meet a woman born in ( and created for ) a wholly different part , and why should they find themselves the complementary missing parts of each other 's jigsaw puzzle , unless it were ordained ? And should n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She had placed the variousfragments of her life in much worse hands than that ! John Laidlaw , Gerald Shepperton , and at least a dozen other accidental lovers had offered an illusion of importance to a life in which paradox set the rules , and she was no longer willing to assumethat any one person could direct her course . If they were such good guides , why were they always losing their own way ? You have something of a mind , Laidlaw had said to her eighteenyears ago , and you ca n't expect it to remain content with the littlethat you seem to want to offer it . Perhaps the time had come to try a different mental and emotional diet . In the meantime , Derek was watching her , curiously amused , and , on an impulse , she stuck out her tongue at him . Damn him . Damn them all . And damn that odd , complex man she had found sprawled among the other flotsam on her private beach . Damn him more than all the others for bringing about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all such a bloody , bloody waste ! The thought that Laidlaw might be aware of her connection with Ludo was unbearable ; it seemed to guarantee disaster . Yet ifp189Derek knew about it , and he did because she herself had mentioned it to him in Lisbon , then Laidlaw would know it too.  --  I ca n't presume to speak for God , he was saying then . Keepingup with Winston Churchill 's thinking is difficult enough . But I do know that German fighter skills are incomparably superior to those in most British squadrons , and that we 've no other pilots as experienced as the Poles . They 're much more highly trained than all but a few of our own prewar RAF professionals . And they hate the Germans.  --  I still say it 's dangerous to trust these foreign Johnnies with anything more complicated than a bayonet , Lord Bellancourt said . Clive armed his sepoys with spears in India , you know . A damn sensible thing.  --  Nobody has to trust anyone very much , Laidlaw said . That 's hardly the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're the most useful.  --  Everyone in the know is quite aware that there 's no such thing as a Battle of Britain anyway , Ann 's father objected . It 's just another of Winston 's brilliant phrases , designed for the Americans . How did that go , by the way ? The Battle of France is over . . . a Battle of Britain is about to begin . . . and then something about a new Dark Ages and Britain 's finest hour . Winston always did make a bloody good speech.  --  It may have been inspired rhetoric at the start , John Laidlaw said quietly . But there 's a very real Battle of Britain now . She heard them but she had ceased to listen . She thought it likely that everyone , including her parents , would forget within days that she had come home , and she looked forward to that hushed , gray quality of her interior air in which she could begin to come to terms with her unchanged world . There was some thinking to be done here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been solitude and time . She could walk the round hills and wait for the next inevitable accident to happen . Sooner of later , she knew , she 'd have to seize control of her own life , however that might present itself to her . And then . . . what ? she asked herself in the cold gray afterdinnergloom , while the candles guttered and the fire burned down . One really could n't be so professionally English as to sayp190that life had to be lived because it was there . That would n't take into account her sense of uselessness , futility , and boredom . At least men invented wars to fight when they could think of nothing more intelligent to do . She had had no useful occupation since she had been her father 's gun bearer in these hills at the age of twelve . That night , there was a storm . Sometime toward midnight , all the electric lights went out in the house while white sheets of fire rippled across the sky , and when she rang the bell in her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where ( she thought ) a fire might be glowing in the grate , but when she got there the stone hearth was cold . The storm raged on beyond the windows where , at one time , a cohort of imported gardeners had tried to impose a roseate English order on a Scottish moor , and she felt very much alone , huddled against the night and looking at cold ashes . And then she listened to the slow , precise fall of approaching footsteps on the granite flagstones behind her tall chair.  --  If you 're the family ghost , she said , go to hell.  --  I used to go there quite often when I was a boy , John Laidlaw said quietly . But it 's like taking your holidays in the Greek islands , do you know ? It 's quite middle-class if you visit more than once , and you certainly would n't want to talk about it to anyone you knew . In the red glow of the thick votive candle he had set on the flagstones near his knees , his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  There , he said . It 'll catch now . Whatever made your father buy this drafty old pile of stones ?  --  The need to be the baron that his title made him , I suppose , Ann said.  --  Well , it 's damned difficult to get a good night 's sleep here.  --  Oh ? Ann said and listened to her own revealing bitterness . And here I thought it was your conscience that sent you snooping along the battlements at midnight.  |  --  I 'm not the Devil , he said . Neither am I God . I do n't accept responsibility for other people 's pain . I 've no trouble with my conscience because everything I do serves a better cause.  --  Gerry Shepperton would 've been glad to hear that.  --  He was told . He did n't care to listen . But I did n't come here to discuss undergraduates who thought that talking about a revolutionwas the same thing as making one . I came to ask you to do some work for me when you return to London.  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I might be able to persuade you once more . You 'd reallybe doing the country quite a service.  --  Sorry , Minister , Ann said . I lack my brother 's capacity for malice or , for that matter , Wally Hudson 's hopeless pursuit of a secure old age . You 'll have to do without me in your Bellancourt collection.  --  I think you 'll find that you do n't have any choice.  --  Are you threatening me ? Because if you 've some sort of blackmail in mind , then you 'd better know that old infidelities do n't embarrass anymore . Not even in this dreadful household.  --  Perish the thought , he said . I came to ask , not threaten . You 've qualities that could be truly useful . In fact , I ca n't think of anyone I 'd trust to do this job as well as you might do it . You always were an extraordinary woman , Ann , and now you 've a chance to do something really important for us all . I was n't jokingat dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult war to win.  --  I ca n't quite see myself in a fighter plane , she said.  --  What I 've in mind may be a lot more useful than shooting down a few Huns.  --  I do n't drive cars all that well either , she said . I 've wrecked three in five years and I 've never been able to change a tire . Patient , as he had always been with her , he went along with her necessary rejoinders.  --  We draw our cars from the Ministry pool , he said . They come complete with girls called Daphne and Opal who drive them into lampposts . I 've something else in mind for you.  --  I will not polish searchlights , she said . I will not wear thatp192awful battle dress . And I will not salute . I have no clerical qualifications whatsoever , Minister , as you should damn well know.  --  Please do n't call me Minister , he said . I 've not become as pompous as all that.  --  I feel a terrible need for formality , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps it 's a way to defend myself against men like you , who know more about me than I can think about with any degree of comfort . You do know that , John , do n't you ? He shrugged , smiled , said : I 've always known it , Ann.  --  Ah , then you have thought about me now and then .  --  You are n't an easy woman to forget about.  --  Yes . Well . Oxford was a terribly long time ago , Minister , she said . Now , what do you think I 'd be able to do ?  --  You 've already started doing it . You know General Prus , do n't you ? You speak French and German ? She listed her accomplishments as if they were sins recited in confession.  --  And some Italian , and a little Spanish , and a bit of good demotic Greek . And I 've given up spying and reporting on my friends , Minister , if that 's what you have in mind . One filthy littlehorror of that kind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite out of fashion this year , he said seriously , and she could laugh again without affectation.  --  Well , is n't that a comfort ? But if I 'm not to spy on anyone , drive your car , type your memoranda , or polish your desk , what would you want me for ?  --  I want you to be exactly what you 've always been , John Laidlaw said.  --  Bloody hell ! said Ann.  --  You 're a cultivated , cosmopolitan Englishwoman who knows how to deal with Continental Europeans . By which I do n't mean overtipping them . I need you to open doors for me , that 's all.  --  Back doors or front doors ? Ann said . And what about the windows ?  --  Whatever has to be opened at a given time.  --  Never again my bedroom door , Minister.  |  --  That 's taken for granted . You 've the perfect background to create the sort of aristocratic social atmosphere in which all these professional democrats like Sikorski , Prus , de Gaulle , and Masaryk can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishwoman they 've admired for a thousand years without really knowing what it was they found admirable . I want them to think of me as Ann Bellancourt 's friend , rather than as the Whitehall civil servant who controls their purse strings and may not , necessarily , have only their best interests in mind.  --  And what will they think of you without Ann Bellancourt 's aristocratic atmospheres ? Ann asked , although she did n't really want to know.  --  They view me , perhaps with some justification , as the sort of Englishman who has manipulated their histories for three hundredyears . They call me The Minister for Unpleasant Affairs.  --  Which is exactly what you are , Minister , is n't it ? Ann said.  --  We 're English , Ann , John Laidlaw said and shrugged . We do have our duty.  --  Over which the sun never sets , Ann said.  --  Quite . And the moment that it does will be the end of Europe . Winston 's new Dark Age has never been very far away , and it is only our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , Ann said . I 'll have to think about it . Minister for Unpleasant Affairs , eh ? That does n't sound very encouraging.  --  Political wit is seldom accurate , John Laidlaw said . In my department , I 'm known as Winston 's other hatchet . The reference is to Lady Churchill , I believe.  --  What a horribly unfair thing to say about Clementine Churchill , Ann said . And what would I be called ? Laidlaw 's Circe ?  --  There 's no reason for anyone to know that what you 'd be doing is at all official . In fact , there 's every reason for no one to know it . And it would be tremendously helpful in dealing with people like Sikorski , Prus , and some of their newer men that we do n't know very much about.  --  I do like Janusz Prus , she said . I quite like . . . the Poles.  --  I know you do , he said and she waited for him to bring up Ludo 's name but he went on : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . He 's an excellent man . I think you 'll like Sikorski . Winston might find him difficult to deal with , butp194he 's the only real leader the Poles have at the moment . Your friend Prus is quite devoted to him , is n't he ?  --  Yes , Ann said . In quite the same way that the younger Poles seem to be devoted to Janusz.  --  That 's terribly interesting , Ann , John Laidlaw said . We were n't quite sure about that . You do see what a help you could be to us , do n't you ?  --  I 'm afraid I do , Ann said . No matter what you call it , John , I 'm to be a spy for you again.  --  Oh , that 's quite the wrong way to look at it ! John Laidlaw protested . I merely want you to be yourself , doing what you want .. , there 's nothing infra dig about that , is there ?  --  I do n't know , Ann said . I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested doubt , but she knew that she had already made up her mind , and Laidlaw , unless she was quite wrong about his powers of perception , knew it too.  --  John , she said in a firmer tone . Do you know what I 've alwaysthought about you ?  --  Yes . Most of the time.  --  I do n't believe I 've ever hated anyone as much as I hated you after that mess at Oxford . Slit wrists , no less ! Nobody needed to give me a necktie for Christmas ! How 's that for the imperturbableBritish upper crust ? You were the first of my truly memorabledisasters . But even then I thought you the best kind of imperialEnglishman . You were fearless , ruthless , cynical , polished , and urbane . . . and no more to be trusted than I was myself . Yet there was always a cause under everything you did.  --  Therein lies the explanation and the expiation , John Laidlaw said.  --  Perhaps . I 've rather given up on causes . Until quite recently , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But perhaps I have n't . I would n't want anything to happen to anyone I like.  --  I do n't see how that could happen , Ann , John Laidlaw said . We all want a decent Europe to live in after the war . We 're all working toward the same ends . There 's no way in which your new Polish friends could be disappointed in us or in you.  --  I want your promise that I 'll never have to betray anyone for whom I care deeply , Ann said . I simply would n't be able to bear the aftermath again.  |  --  I ca n't imagine such a thing becoming necessary , John Laidlaw said . In fact , let me suggest in strictest confidence that the very best of your new friends can benefit quite considerably from what we 've in mind.  --  And who might that be ? They were silent then , for a time : strangers who shared a ghost . The pull of intimacy made them ill at ease . What better way to emphasize her suspicion of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told herself that he could n't be aware of her affair with Ludo , yet she knew , even then , that she was lying to herself again . She was  --  she had to be  --  equally wrong about his continuing ability to harm her . Her fear of him had unhinged her objectivity , she was sure . Guilt made her censorious.  --  If , she said , I did do what you want , not that I 'm saying I will , I 'd want two other guarantees . One is my own privacy . I would n't tolerate it if someone spied on me . My life must remain totally my own.  --  I 've never thought of it as anything else , he said.  --  And finally , if I am to be your arranger of atmospheres or whatever you care to call it , I 'd want to be sure that neither Wally Hudson nor my brother know anything about it . Like you , John , you see , I do n't believe in giving anyone an unearned advantage.  --  Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's your answer , Ann ? She sighed and said in a voice that sounded tired and resigned , even to herself : Well , it is better than polishing brass mountings on a Bofors gun . I 'll think about it , Minister.  --  Thank you , Ann , he said . Give me a ring when you 're back in town.  --  I 'll think about it , Minister , Ann said . During the next few days , she wondered why she had allowed herself to enter Laidlaw 's plans and thought of several explanations . Bellancourt and its cast had had its effect . It had been a painfully sharp reminder of how much she detested the insincerities , cruelties , and posturings to which she had been born . Shep196felt far more at ease in a foreign air which did n't trouble her conscience , and the Minister offered an opportunity for service in that atmosphere . She needed to believe that Laidlaw 's promises could be trusted despite past experience , that nothing she did for him would endanger anyone she cared for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being useful to her new friends ( as well as to her country ) she 'd make amends for her Oxford past . She thought , although she would n't admit it to herself just yet , that in helping to bring together the Poles whom she continued to admire , with the sort of Englishmen whom she wanted to admire the most , she would be bridging whatever gaps existed between herself and Ludo . In truth , and in the time 's own air of recklessness and hazard , she did n't think that the alliance between the Poles and Britain could ever be threatened . Each side had begun to earn too much of the other 's gratitude and affection . Laidlaw had n't exaggerated the desperate nature of the battle at the end of August , nor who was proving the most useful in it . The Poles , and the First CanadianSquadron , went into action in that critical moment , and the battered British could finally draw a breath . Some hundred and forty Polish pilots had been flying with British squadrons from the start , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by themselves , and , within days , their quality made itself felt . As the BBC and her father 's Times and Scotsmanreported , 303 Squadron ( Polish ) shot down fourteen Messerschmittsand crippled five others in its first day of combat , then six more fighters and ten bombers on the second day . Flying ten record sorties on the last day of August , Ludo 's men destroyedeighteen German fighters . Nine bombers had been seen to smoke , but not to explode or plunge into the furrowed Kentish fields , so they were counted as " probables " rather than as confirmed victories , and the tide of the battle had begun to turn . Unlike the untried young RAF replacements , whose heroism could seldom tip the scales of victory against cold German skill , the Poles had brought into the battle the icy expertise of seasoned veterans . They had already shot down a hundred and thirty-eight German aircraft over Poland and forty-eight over France . They were remarkable marksmen whose first three squadronstook the top three places in the RAF spring gunnery exer/cises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their practice was to close within one hundred feet of an enemy machine before opening fire , and they fought with no regard for their own lives or safety . Six of them died over London when , out of ammunition , they rammed German bombers . Trying to understand their savage dedication , it was convenient for the journalists to say that they fought like madmen  --  madness being the only way to explain courage beyond ordinary understanding  --  buttheir enthusiasm , spirit , and elan in battle infected everyone . They could n't show themselves in an English pub withoutcausing a storm of heartfelt and genuine applause . And Ann , of course , whenever she read or heard anything about them , saw each of them as Ludo . With this in mind , and carried on the wave of general enthusiasm , how could she doubt Laidlaw 's purpose or question his motives ? Even her father , whose xenophobia had acquired the weight of a religion , began to make complimentary sounds about Polish fighter pilots . She returned to London in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . She telephoned Prus at the Rubens Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road , where the reorganizedPolish Armed Forces in the United Kingdom had their generalheadquarters . He was delighted to hear from her again . He told her that Ludo had reached his squadron at about the time that she had gone to Scotland , but she had already read about him in her father 's Times . THAT DAY , which would be both the turning point of the battle and its most violent chapter , dawned in a cold mist over southern England . The clouds were variable at three thousand feet , there was a weak west wind that swirled among the buildings , and as the Hurricanes rose above the South Gate of Northolt Air Station , they were caught in the burbling downdraft . Their takeoff was toward the northwest , across trees and above the pretty ,  |p198green  , delineated suburb , and Ludo could bless the Rolls-Royce Merlin III engines , whose twelve liquid-cooled cylinders gave the humpbacked fighters one thousand and thirty horsepower to lift them steeply above danger . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sornmerset , the Canadian pilot and regular RAF officer who led them that morning , was talking with the ground controllers , who were reporting a mass enemy assembly over the French coast near Calais , and Ludo took a quick look around , then counted his men . Gerlach waggled his wings for him . Reszke nodded under his big bubble canopy and cocked his thumb upward in that half-mocking gesture they had all learned from the British pilots , and Frantisek , the Czech who pretended to a vast historic disaffection with the Poles but who had refused to fly with any other squadron , pushed open his canopy and lit a cigar  --  Two vector five , the controller 's voice crackled in their earphones . Eagles One and Two , Maple Leaf One , you 'll find forty bandits at eighteen thousand angels , fifty at twenty-six . Many more assembling . And for God 's sake , Eagles , do n't bugger the frequency for me , will you , please ?  --  Roger , Ops , Johnny Sommerset said , and then in French : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect anyone we know , Johnny , Reszke said . Reinecke 's orange-nosed Geschwader , known throughout the RAF as the Calais Gang , had been identified in the Calais region , and there were debts to pay.  --  Just Hell 's grim tyrant , I expect , the Canadian squadron leader said . But you can keep hoping.  --  Now look here , Eagle One , do button it down ! Why do you always have to talk so much ? the controller said . Do keep the frequencies clear for instruction.  --  The boys like to know who 's coming out to play , Johnny Sommerset said . But we 'll be good . Sony to give you fits so early , Controller.  --  Good hunting , then , and good luck , the controller said .  --  And the best of British luck to you , old chap , Gerlach said in his terrible imitation of the English language , and all the othersp199laughed , and twenty squadrons of Hurricanes and Spitfires heard the controller say : Aw ... bloody hell ! They flew in silence then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen days since the squadron had become fully operational , his men had destroyed one hundred and twenty-six enemy aircraft and fourteen " probables " and damaged nine others . Their score for just the last four days was fifty to three . They had had their first casualties on September 11 when three of them were killed in a fight with an entire German Geschwader , of whom they shot down seven . Gerlach was nicked in the foot in that scramble . Straka , who had reached England only the week before , was burned around the face when he collided with a Spitfire over Tunbridge Wells . Reszke was shot down but landed safely by parachute in a Kentish village . Since he was wearing only striped pajamas at the time , he was unable to convince the Home Guards that he was not a German and spent the night in a rural jail until Johnny Sommerset could come for him next morning . Now they were airborne again and flying against the greatest Germanarmada assembled against London since the beginning of the war . The soft green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray smudge pot that was London , and Ludo thought of the kindness and generosity he and his men had found there , of the shy , friendly men who put the pints of beer on the tables and then walked away , of the eager women , of the quiet sympathy given to them by people who had no reason to expectanything but a disaster of their own . No one in Britain doubted that this was the most terrible of of the German Wehrmacht seemed almost mystical , yet their stubbornness would save them . Just as the rout at Dunkirk had been publicized as a heroic British feat , a miraculous rescue rather than a staggering defeat , so this new felicitously named Battle of Britain in which they were engaged would demonstrate Britain 's unbreakable resistance . The endless glory of the British people must include the fact that they never doubted it . Then they flew south over Kent and angled toward the Channel , climbing steadily to twenty thousand feet , where they cut to cruising speed to save fuel . Their range was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty-eight miles an hour  --  the speed at which the Emils could cruise two thousand feet higher than the top altitude of the Hurricanes . Interception from below would be suicidal . Even so , the Hurricane was a wonderfullydangerous weapon after the P-7s and - 11s that most of Ludo 's pilots had flown in Poland.  --  Guns , gentlemen , Johnny Sommerset said , and each of them fired a short burst from his eight Browning .3o3-caliber machine guns . The lights winked steadily on Ludo 's panel and the stick shuddered lightly in his hand.  --  I 've a jam , Gerlach said.  --  D' you want to go back ?  --  No . Perhaps they 'll clear . Chief Auerbach would tear my head off if I went back for nothing.  --  Keep your eyes peeled , gentlemen , Johnny Sommerset said . The Huns should be with us any minute now . The ground controller called out urgently to the Canadians and the second Polish squadron and they veered sharply to the northeast , wagging their wings in farewell , and Ludo 's twelve machinesbegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; none were necessary . The flights formed , one behind the other , like steps rising into the sky behind the lead echelon . They 'd have the sun in their eyes but there was nothing they could do about that . The Emils would hit them head on from above . Their one advantage was that the wood-and-fabric fuselage of the Hurricane was more resistant to cannon shells than the all-metal Emils . Half the time , the shells went right through without exploding and , after the first pass , they 'd be above the Germans . Someone ( he thought it was Reszke ) had begun to whistle .  --  Wojenko , wojenko . . . Little Lady War . . . And then ( as suddenly ) the whistling stopped.  --  I . . . do believe we have company , Reszke said . The Germans flew in tight order at eighteen thousand feet and about a mile to the north : forty Dornier Do 215 heavy bombers . Wing tip to wing tip , just like over Warsaw .... A small force of Bf rro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . . . . The Emils would be on the roof , hidden in the pale sun at thirty thousand feet . It was ten-thirty in the morning and the mists had cleared.  |p201Ludo  peered upward , searching for the single-seaters , and then he looked down and saw small white creatures standing about in the peaceful fields , and thought they were sheep . Then he began to laugh and could n't stop laughing because these were not sheep but men dressed in white and playing their game of cricket on a Sunday morning . He was moved by a wave of sudden affection for this strange , implacable , undemonstrative race which could ignore its own imminent destruction . What the hell kind of a chance would mere bombers have against that kind of people ? he thought , and then Ann 's long , dark , well-bred face appeared on his mental screen , and he blinked away the image of the downturned mouth , and the black eyes that seemed like painful bruises pressed into her flesh , and focused on distance.  --  Johnny ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's pass them , get the sun behind us , and shoot them in the back . I do n't think they 've seen us.  --  I bow to your experience , Gentleman Johnny said.  --  No , no , Eagle One ! the controller shouted . Go straight in as vectored ! I 'll tell you when to cross sector lines !  --  Bloody R/T 's gone dead , Johnny Sommerset said . Did you hear something , Ludo ?  --  Nothing , Ludo said.  --  Who do they think they are , bloody Nelsons ? the controller raged but , in truth , it was impossible then to hear anything within the one vast sound of several distant battles drawing nearer . The airwaves were full of cries , exhortations , warnings and explosions , calls for help and blasphemous obscenities . The battle raged in a rough hexagon of sixty-by-eighty miles above East Kent , the Channel , and London 's East End as more and more enemy formations went into the attack . The Germans came in waves of forty to one hundred bombers at various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty heavy bombers with Stukas below them  --  and a great assembly of Messerschmitts flying over them . Ludo 's men sailed past the German armada like ships in review , then turned and attacked . They came down from the latemorningsun on the rear of the unsuspecting Germans , fallingp202from twenty-four thousand feet in flights of three , one flight behind the other as if for target practice , and they were through the Zerstorers and among the bombers before one angry stream of tracers could rise up to meet them . They started shooting at a distance of two hundred feet and turned away only when the glass greenhouse-domes of the bomber crew compartments blocked their fields of vision , and shards of metal ( flaps , ailerons , shotawaycontrols ) rattled on their wings . They dived through the bombers then turned and attacked them from below while the German gunners were still peppering the Emils which had come down to help them . They shot down three Zerstorers and ten Dorniers on the first pass , three more on the second , and then the shattered enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ludo could hear an angry Viennese voice shouting : Heiliges Sakrament ! By the smothered balls of the innocents , wait ! There 's only twelve of them ! And then the sky was clear and empty of Germans . Throughout , as though it were unthinkable for him to do anything else , he had looked for Reinecke but the wily German had eluded him . Since that day when Reinecke 's schoolboys had sent him down in flames over Warsaw , and then tried to kill him as he hung unconscious in the shrouds of his tattered parachute , he had fought them a half-dozen times , had shot down ten of them , had watched them kill five of his own men , but he had never come up against Reinecke himself . He looked for him in every dogfight with the orange-nosed Geschwader . The easy Viennese drawl was unmistakable in the ether . He knew by instinct that Reinecke looked for him with the same cold blend of curiosity and respect . But the fights were always too sudden , too swift , and neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase had taken them over the French coast , where they caught a formation of Heinkel He Ills gathering for another flight across the Channel . Without their screening fighters , the Heinkels had no hope of surviving a Hurricane attack . They scatteredand fled . Then the Poles came under fire from German antiaircraftartillery which , in turn , scattered them , and they flew back to England in pairs or alone.  |p203Alone  , he hesitated only for a moment . Reinecke 's forward field was temptingly near . He checked his fuel and armament , then climbed and flew northeast into France . East of Calais , the ground mist and the morning fog and the sparse cloud cover thinned out even further , and he could look down at the peaceful French countryside , the warm brown fields and the straight , tree-lined highways that would always remind him of wrecked armies , defeat , and surrender , and he did his best to check his contempt as he flew above the sunbaked little towns in which life went on , untroubled , as if nothing had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a shadow skimming the poplars and hidingin the hedgerows and , at first , thought it to be his own . The dark , nimble cruciform hugged the land as he himself had once dodged among trees and haystacks to escape from the grinning Messerschmitts of Reinecke 's first squadron , and then he knew that he had found a victim . It was a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch , an unarmedground-liaison aircraft , and about as dangerous as a gnat . So slow that it could fly at thirty-five miles an hour without stalling , it could land in fifty feet without rounding out , and it could be shot down with an air rifle . Such kills were not counted in the RAF , although at least one foreign ace had made his reputation with seventeen of them . He banked , cut his throttle , fell out of the cloud , and dropped toward the Storch as slowly as he could , watching the helpless German start his desperate dance of evasion among the trees and spires . Even so , he could be dead in moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all countries had turned fighter pilots into lone , knightly figures who fought chivalric duels in the sky , and that 's the way they would ascend into romantic legend ; the truth , as Ludo knew too well , was considerably different . Now and then , in the war 's earlier days , there may have been moments of pity , of sympathy , of guilt , of rare human impulse , but these were long spent . Truth was , that the most successful of these quite unromanticheroes killed their enemies from ambush , diving at them steeply from the sun , and shooting them in the back . No fighter pilot ever questioned the fact that he would be a legitimate target while drifting , helplessly , in the shrouds of his parachute . GermanRed Cross float planes , Storches , and British Miles Masterp204trainers and Lysanders were shot down ( in passing , as it were ) as a matter of course . If a pilot chose not to count such kills , that was his business ; the killing , however , was sanctioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dancing Storch . The spindly little airplane skipped out of his way , and he flew on , havingneither time nor fuel to waste . As it was , and as the frenzied squawks in his earphones informed him , other and more dangerousenemies were running to their machines only ten miles away . It was his turn , then , to go to ground level and skim the hedges as he drew nearer to his goal . High overhead , rows of gray puffs blossomed out as AA-gunners opened up , less in the hope of hittinghim than to show his path to the fighter pilots . The momentsof his safety narrowed , and then they were gone . He flew between trees , so close to the highway that the white summer dust boiled up behind him , and he could read the road signs and the advertisements for wines , hotels , historic landmarks , and the odd bathing beach . He had been there before ; a wingless windmill on the left , and a rustic auberge on the right , signaled the new German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went up over the trees just high enough to clear them as he turned . A quick check of his instruments then . The fuel-contents gauge had begun to blink , the oil-pressure wavered , and he switched on the electrically operated reflector sight and set all his guns to FIRE . The pines , beeches , oaks , and chestnuts were distinct , each branch and leaf sharply drawn as they bowed before his slipstream ; and then they were gone , and he was in the open , and there were three orange-nosed Messerschmitts speeding toward him on the ground . He dipped his own scarlet spinner just enough to center his gunsights and pressed all his triggers . As the guns responded , and as the Hurricane bucked against the recoil , he pushed the throttle lever wide open and pulled back on the stick and burst into the sky through the oily black smoke of the Messerschmitt that blew up under him . Then he went straight up and over in the classic Immelmann turn , rolling out at the top of the loop so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose flight leader he had killed had cleared the trees at the end of the runway and were climbing steeply rightp205into his gunsights . He tapped the throttle lever back and eased the stick forward just enough to dip his guns toward them , and steadied his machine with gentle pressure on the stick and oppositerudder . Each of his movements was consciously unhurried , as if he had all the time in the world to set out his tools , and  --  feeling neither anger nor pity nor elation  --  he shot them down one after the other on that single pass from above and behind . The second plane , hit from fifty feet right into the cockpit , had been so close that Ludo saw the German pilot 's mouth moving as he cursed him . They fell and burned among trees in great , greasy clouds of black smoke edged with red-and-orange , and he wondered in an offhand , disinterested fashion how old these two pilots might have been . He doubted that their combined ages could have totaled more than forty years . Fighter pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his own squadron 's infant , had just turned nineteen ) , and no experienced , battle-wary flier would have climbed with such single-minded innocence toward certain death as these two had done . Had one of them been Reinecke , or his Austrian countryman " Joschko " Fozo , or Heinz Bar , or MaxHelmuthOstermann , or Wilhelm Balthasar , or Hans-Karl Mayer ( whom Ludo had shot down and killed only the week before ) , his Immelmann would have been anticipated and the Messerschmittswould have been somewhere else . These were dangerous skies . Climbing , he twisted , made unexpectedirregular turns , listened to the angry German voices in his earphones . Anywhere along the Channel coast , he could encountermen like Werner Molders , Adolf Galland , Helmut Wick , Herbert Ihlefeld , Joachim Muncheberg , Walter Oseau , or HansJoachimMarseille  --  the " dog-collar soldiers " of the Luftwaffe fighter arm who wore the Ritterkreuz at the neck and who had shot down more than three hundred Hurricanes and Spitfires between them . Even in light of the odd Luftwaffe habit of multiplyingair victories by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all but three of them worked in the air zones assigned to the Poles . Entering their air , one moved as cautiously as if coming upon a wolf 's lair in a forest ; young pilots remembered every childhood prayer at such times . He gained height in tight , rapid turns among the bursting an/tiaircraft shells , and scanned the sky above him and behind him at each turn . The sun had climbed high enough to be dangerous but nothing came from it on this Sunday morning . Arriving alone , he had evaded detection until his meeting with the Storch , so that no sentry squadron had been sent to lay an ambush in the sun . He regarded the deadly little puffs of gray-and-black smoke around him with academic interest . At twenty thousand feet , a Hurricane offered a frustrating target ; small , and moving swiftly , it was almost impossible to hit from the ground.  --  Bark all you want , he said . The horse has been stolen . Once more alone , a pale and dwindling speck concealed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course for home . He had killed three Germans . He had not been hit . It had been a rather ordinary Sunday morning . Cold in his shirtsleeves , he switched on the electric heater , activatedthe air vents , and lit a cigar . Equally cold and gray and deadly and unfeeling , the Channel beckoned to him under wisps of cloud . The horizon tilted . He watched the forest of masts fixed in the Goodwin Sands , the rusting hulks of torpedoed ships in the Thames Estuary off Gravesend , the huge concrete gun forts on their spindly-legged towers , looking as though they had come , ready-made , out of the imagination of H. G. Wells , and beyond them the dark and smoky mass of London . He thought about Ann . He wondered if he would run into her again . He supposed he might if she returned to England . London , particularly wartime London , was remarkably small for a metropolis of its size . There were only so many places where one could go without encounteringEngland 's terrible austerity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull provincial town , and Ann was sure to know them . He flew on , perfectly aware of everything around him , no matterwhere his thoughts carried him at any given moment . The deep , steady humming of the engine , the hiss of the slipstream through a loose rubber gasket in the canopy housing , and now , as he brushed against the edge of a cloud , the crystal droplets of rain on his windshield , were part of his most immediate world . He thought that if this were not to be his true and ultimate reality , he would n't want another.  |p207Northeastern  Sector Ground Control had spotted him then and queries crackled in his earphones , so he put out his cigar , clipped his helmet 's chin piece and throat microphone in place , and identified himself . The ground controller , an Irishman by his accent , welcomed him to England.  --  And did ye have a nice little visit with the Calais Gang ?  --  I doubt they 'd think so , Controller , Ludo said.  --  Left them a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? Well , the good Saints will forgive ye for working on a Sunday . There 's nothing they like to hear more than the Devil gnashing his ugly , great teeth . You 're clear at fifteen thousand all the way home , me bhoy.  --  Thank you , Controller.  --  And may the Saints keep you . The lunar landscape of London 's impoverished East End , where , on Winston Churchill 's order , the Double-X manipulators who controlled all German spies in England had lured the Luftwaffe time and time again , so as to spare Whitehall and the homes and property of the rich , slid under his wing . Tenements that had become mass graves . Scorched ruins . A terrible triage had been practiced here on unsuspecting thousands so that somethingthought to be of greater value than they could escape destruction . He wondered what it would be like to live in a century and on a continent where ruins were always a consequence of antiquityrather than of premeditated murder . What would that sort of life offer as a challenge ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dedications there ? War was his home , he knew then , even if it had made him homeless . Rounding the field to land , he identified himself as Six , Eagle One , his R/T designation as squadron commander , and gave the customary cryptic accounting of his morning 's work.  --  Roger , Six , Eagle One , the laconic towerman replied . Come in on five-six-oh and watch for the potholes . Ground wind termer and gusting . Good show . Welcome home.  |p208THE  FEELING , after you 've been shot at in the air and survived , after you 've killed the man and destroyed the machine whose purposewas to kill you , is much like the euphoria that accompanies a bottle of aged vintage wine . Everything seems possible , nothing is quite believable , and nothing seems to matter . Yet this day was still too young to end without additional surprises , Ludo knew . He made his wide , shallow turn , cut the throttle and heard the engine subside to a growling whisper , then looked out and down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was foul with ashes and dissipating smoke , and he could see fires burning all over the field . Auerbach 's ground crews were beating out the embers with brooms and mattress covers . A crumpled Hurricane ( Wilchurzak 's ) leaned against the wreckage of a NAAFI van that had invaded Northolt to dispense its battery-acid tea , pork pies , deadly sausages , and custard . Near the mess entrance , a large welcoming committee of ground crews , correspondents , and distinguishedvisitors in khaki had begun to gather . He looked among them for his own returned pilots , but there were still more of them in the air , coming in from the red-streaked mass of smoke above London , than on the ground . Two of them angled sharply just in front of him  --  Zegar and Kawecki , to judge by their numbers  --  coming in on the last of their fuel over the tall trees at the edge of the field . Indeed , their engines stuttered and coughed as they thinned out the fuel mix at the top of their glide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then rolled and turned and braked before the hangars , their engines had died . Both the machines were full of holes , their canopies shattered , the wings streaked with cordite above the gun ports , but both the pilots raised an arm in the two-fingered victory sign as the mechanicsswarmed about their machines . Then , as the ground crews lifted them from their cockpits , something of the other picture of the battle presented itself . Another Hurricane appearedp209overhead , trailing smoke , and just before the machine became a ball of fire , a small black figure tumbled out of it . The flat white circular canopy snapped open above it and the man drifted out of sight . Then the wheels of Ludo 's own machine touched concrete , squealed , and rolled . Glass glinted in the hands of the cheering men who ran toward him with their congratulations . They had all come out to watch for his return  --  Auerbach , Jacek Gemba , the injured Wilchurzak , the British station officers , the visitors , and the correspondents . He saw Loomis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a car . General Prus was stepping from another . Romuald Modelski had appeared near what looked like a reviewing stand and was glancing nervouslyat his watch . In the near distance , black smoke was boiling upward out of the fuel dump . It spread in the sky like spilled ink . They had come out to meet him and now they ran toward him and each of them carried a bottle of champagne , because the news that had come down from London was simply astounding . What is it ? he asked uneasily , his attention straying to the soiled sky . What is it ? they cried . A dozen bottles of champagne were lifted toward him , and he took one , drank from it , and then pressed the icy glass against his forehead . Up on the wing , and helping Ludo with his harness straps , Auerbach said : What is it , it 's a victory . The biggest one yet . Maybe we wo n't be going home day after tomorrow , maybe it 's too soon for that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainnow.  --  Oh ? A sudden weariness had fallen upon Ludo , the aftershock of combat . The concrete felt liquid and unreal under his boots , his hands closed and opened . A fist , cold as ice , had clenched in his stomach.  --  Three dead men do n't make any kind of victory , he heard himself saying , and then everyone was laughing and talking at the same time.  --  Three dead men ? Auerbach said , grinning . More like thirty , forty.  |  --  No , more , much more ! Urban babbled in his childish voice . We 've finally beaten them . They 're finished , Major , and not just for today . Suddenly anxious , still searching the sky for Gerlach , Reszke , Straka , and the others , he told the young man not to be a fool . But then the story began to piece itself together . He began to listen . The words acquired coherence . He saw the images they created . No , not the hurtling aircraft , the flash of yellow fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the cursing round mouth of the German pilot in his flaming cockpit , but as words printed upon a page . At noon , one hundred German bombers had finally broken through Dowding 's line and appeared over London , and Fighter Command was claiming forty of them as destroyed . Ludo 's men had caught another forty Dornier Do 215S just east of the city , shot down sixteen of them in less than one minute , and scattered the rest . Joseph Frantisek had shot down five Messerschmitts that morning . Reszke had destroyed three over the English Channel . Gerlach and Straka had accounted for five Heinkels between them . Ludo 's own score for the day was six . In the nineteen days beginning August 26 , when the first two squadrons of the Polish wing had entered the battle , the Germans had lost four hundred and twenty-seven aircraft  --  more than a thousand of their finest aircrews and pilots  --  and that was more than even such a superb war machine as the Luftwaffe could bear . Frantisek had destroyed seventeen of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow fliers in 303 Squadron were next on the roster of RAF high scorers with sixteen and fifteen victories each . Of the next ten top aces of Fighter Command , those who had destroyed between eleven and fourteen enemy aircraft , six were foreign volunteers and three of them were Poles . Of the thirty pilots , each of whom had shot down between five and ten enemy machines , eight were Poles flying with 303 and 302 squadrons . Each of the hundred and forty-seven Polish pilots who flew in the battle had destroyed at least two German aircraft in combat . Thirty of them were killed , seventy-eight were wounded , forty-two received high British decorations . Later , as the excited babble of visitors and pilots suggested to Ludo , historians would mark this noon attack on London , on September 15 , as the climax of the Luftwaffe 's assault , the pointp211at which the day 's battle  --  and the greater battle of which it was a part  --  was finally won . Thereafter , the Germans would never come in strength against British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , and they would make deadly hit-and-run fighter-bomber raids across the English Channel , but they 'd make no more mass daylight raids against a British target . It would be several days before Churchill said so , but everyoneknew that Britain 's most important crisis had been passed . In the next few months , the American Congress would approve the Lend-Lease Bill , and a great stream of arms , munitions , foodstuffs , raw materials , fuels , and medical supplies would begin to flow across the Atlantic . No one , no matter how young and optimistic , was able to say whether the war itself had been won in those ten hours on a Sunday afternoon and morning . Not even laughing Urban would go as far as that . But , if all he heard were true , Ludo knew that from that day on the war could n't be lost . The cheering young men who hoisted him to their shoulders and carried him toward the assembled visitors  --  the King and the Queen and General Sikorski , the ministers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red-tabbed officers of the General Staff whose eyes were wet with tears  --  had every reason to congratulate themselves , Ludo knew , although their reasons and his own might n't have been the same . Their laughter was loud and nervous , traversing the scales . There was an element of astonishment in their huge satisfaction with themselves . Each of them had done better than he had expected ; each was alive to laugh after the battle , and only Ludo seemed to know that a far greater and more decisive battle had to be fought inside each of them , and that he 'd be fighting his own , unaided , to the death . Auerbach looked steadily at Ludo and their glances locked . They knew each other too well for any dissembling ; the bonds they shared had given them a closeness that other kinds of men could only imagine . Yet even those familiar gray eyes , crouched in their nests of wrinkles , could n't grant Ludo the absolution he wanted . Something had changed in the air in which he was moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and his certainties . For the first time that he could recall , he was unable to take pleasure in his morning 's work or pride in its result . Perhaps it was the persistent image of screaming young men lifted from shattered cockpits , of boys rather than machines who burned in the air , that intruded on any sense of satisfaction that he might have had . When a combat leader develops a conscience , he thought worriedly , it 's time to look for a less demanding mistress than Little Lady War . There was one fleeting moment when he wished that he could go back to that untrammeled innocence with which his young pilots went after their victories or , if not that far back , then at least to the simplicities of a patriot . But there had been too much death in his life for such black-and-white conclusions . The cold , unfeeling processes of war had become a river by that time , and he was far downstream , and there was no way to reverse his course . Despite the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew himself to have reached that point of physical and mental weariness in which conscience becomes the real enemy . As Auerbach murmured in his ear : What one wants and what 's available just are n't the same thing . Three Hurricanes landed then , one after another , and Ludo turned to watch them with a sense of gratitude , since they disrupted the trend of his thoughts . Each had been hit several times , and their gun ports were heavy with soot.  --  That 's Karcz , Kulesza , and Frantisek , Auerbach named the three sergeant-pilots . Lieutenant Matejczyk went to Tanglemere . Air-sea rescue pulled young Kozloski out of the water near Haesebruck . It looks like everybody 's had a busy day.  --  Lieutenant Reszke came down near Dover , Jacek Gemba said importantly , then flushed and explained . They telephoned to the mess about ten minutes ago , begging the major 's pardon.  --  Who was that who bailed out ? Ludo asked . Did you see ?  --  Too high to spot his numbers , Auerbach said , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast drew their attention upward.  --  Coarse mixture , coarse mixture , the line chief muttered andp213began to curse , and everyone knew what was about to happen . Whether he was wounded or unconscious , or whether he had simplyforgotten his landing procedures , the incoming pilot had n't switched his fuel mix and , in another moment , he would be killed in flames . Wilchurzak , who had sprained an ankle in his crash but was otherwise uninjured , began to hobble with desperate urgency toward the nearest parked machine , to find an R/T set and send out a warning . Then he stopped in midstep , stiff as a doll in white-faced resignation . It was , of course , too late for the pilot to do anything.  --  Straka ? someone murmured , and someone else said softly : Poor son-of-a-bitch . It was just like tossing in a nightmare from which one ca n't awake , Ludo thought . You know that the moment is an unreal one , but the nightmare holds you a prisoner anyway . The Hurricanecame on and then seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballerina between entrechats , and then the wheels touched the ground and snapped off like sticks , the machinestood on its propeller and began to cartwheel , and struts and shorn wings and lengths of tubular frame and engine parts and fabric flew into the air . The fuel tank exploded and a monstrousfireball bounced across the runway , and then there was only a pool of greasy black smoke and red fire.  --  There wo n't be enough left of him for a funeral , someone said . Damn . A hundred pounds of sand and two red bits of cloth in yet another coffin . Loomis and Romuald Modelski had reached them together . The diplomat cried out : How could you let that happen ? What will the British think ? The King . . . the Queen .. .  --  Who ? Ludo said and , for a moment , he really did n't know what his brother-in-law was talking about.  --  We did n't invite them here to witness a fiasco !  --  We had n't planned one for them , Ludo said . Loomis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I 'm sorry . I know what you must feel . It 's terrible to see someone you care for die like that.  --  I hardly knew him , the young pilot said and shrugged the American 's hand away.  |p214As  a frequent visitor to Ludo 's squadron , Loomis knew that Straka and Wilchurzak had been inseparable , each fiercely protectiveof the other . But now , pale as he was , Wilchurzak had begun to hum a music hall ditty as he and Ludo and Loomis and Romuald Modelski , followed by Auerbach and Urban and the other pilots , and ( at a respectful distance ) by Jacek Gemba and several mechanics , began to walk toward the milling corespondents.  --  You were like brothers , the American insisted . And are n't you engaged to Straka 's sister ? How can you be so cold and unfeelingabout this ? What sort of people are you , anyway ?  --  Take it easy , Loomis , Ludo said . You were in Warsaw . You know what we are.  --  This is the worst possible impression to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get over it . Cold ? Unfeeling ? Indifferent to the death of friends ? Nothing could be less true , Ludo knew . But who but one of their own kind could understand their notion of themselves as replaceable components of their country 's history ? Life itself had proved an enemy , meriting disdain . Rejecting their own injuries and the death of friends , they could always regard themselves as whole . Whether or not they failed in their tasks , their rejection of the penalty of failure would nullify every victory of their enemies . The pilots walked in what seemed a comfortable silence , hands thrust deep into the pockets of their flying jackets , heads lowered against the sharp bite of an unseasonable wind that swirled among the hangars . Dark glasses concealed their tears , as they did Ludo 's own . But , even so , he averted his head . The distinguished visitors had been ushered swiftly into the officers ' mess . The flames behind them had been smothered with sand and an Americanbulldozer was pushing the debris and wreckage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be raining soon . Stung by their rejection of his sympathy , Loomis said : I wish someone would give me a simple explanation.  --  If something has a simple explanation , Auerbach said quietly , it 's not worth explaining.  |p215Always  afterward , when asked about that afternoon and eveningthat marked the high tide of the Poles among their Western Allies , Ludo would recall three conversations , one of them overheard . King George VI questioned him about RAF fighter tactics and listened attentively to his reasoned praise of the German Schwarme finger-four formations . He answered questions from the Air Minister , Sir Archibald Sinclair , about the merits of the Spitfire as opposed to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 . The Spitfire , which was Churchill 's favorite symbol for Britain 's finest hour , was superior to all German fighters except at altitudes above twenty thousand feet , in which the Bf 109 excelled . Air Marshal Portal pointed out that Ludo 's squadron flew early-model Hawker Hurricanes  --  the wooden , fabric-covered machines that made up eighty percent of Fighter Command in the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remarkable . Lord Beaverbrook , the Minister of Aircraft Production , assured him that the next available Spitfires would go to the Poles . John Laidlaw , a permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office , invitedhim to lunch . But these were not the conversations that would stand out in his memory . While waiting for General Sikorski to beckon him over , he had a drink with Prus , who remarked that Englishmen seemed to like him.  --  Is that important , sir ? Ludo asked  --  It could be very useful to us , the general said . We do n't have as many friends among them as we should . Oh , it all looks very friendly on the surface , we 're the very picture of Allied unity at war , but there 's the future to think about , you know.  --  A fighter pilot has to be very young to think about the future , Ludo smiled and said.  --  All the more reason for you to stop rattling about in the sky . We 've lots of friends today when we 're needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the war goes on and we 're needed less . That 's a law of nature , I 'm afraid.  --  Then we 'll just have to keep fighting all the harder , Ludo said.  |p216The  general laughed softly , said : Spoken like a soldier . But can we still afford to look at the world across the ears of a horse ? Or , in your case , out of the cockpit of an airplane ? No , my boy , there are other ways of doing your duty . You ought to consider spendingmore time on the ground.  --  I 'm a line officer , sir , Ludo said . I do what I know best . Politicsis a mystery to me and I 'd just as soon know nothing about it.  --  Some of us think that you may have quite a talent for it , the general said.  --  I do n't write my own press releases , General , Ludo said and the older man laughed.  --  Well , whoever does it must be doing a labor of love . Hardly a week seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . Of course , I ca n't order you to march yourself into politics , but I know that General Sikorski would find good use for you . As a trusted aide to the general , who is chairman of the Allied Council , you 'd have access to everyone who matters in this war . Looking about the crowded room , hearing his laughing pilots , Ludo smiled and said : I think I already do.  --  The view from the cockpit of a fighter plane is more limited than you think , the general said , and Ludo wished that this difficult conversation might end.  --  I would n't even know how to begin to do anything else , sir , Ludo said.  --  Practice takes care of that . Training , careful guidance . I watched you talking with Sinclair , Beaverbrook , and Portal . These are immensely powerful men and yet they listened to you with extreme attention . King George himself spent more time with you than even his extraordinary kindness required . You have a natural quality of leadership that such men identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men like Laidlaw would waste five seconds on an air force major unless they thought that he might be important to them in some way ? They did n't become what they are by ignoring the obvious . General Sikorski has given us a leadership we can be proud to follow , but he has great difficulty in dealing with Churchill , who simply ca n't believe that a man of such rocklike integrity is entirely real . I speak for thep217general when I say that we must begin to develop a political leadershipwith which our allies may feel more at home.  --  I 've a responsibility to my pilots , sir.  --  Is that more important than your responsibility to your coun-try ?  --  Forgive me , sir , but to me they 're one and the same.  --  Yes , I suppose that 's the secret , the general said softly . To love the people for whom you 're responsible . I suppose that 's why your men love you as much as they do and that 's what all the others see.  --  You are the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and responsibility are indivisible , Ludo said . And that all of it is a matter of love.  --  Yes , I suppose I did , the general said . We met in simpler times . Wars were uncomplicated then . The enemy was always in front and gallantry was just another way to test the value of one 's own convictions . You could say then that love and life were interchangeable . If you loved something , you 'd risk your life for it and military heroism made sense . Now , when bravery decides nothing at a conference table , when integrity has become incomprehensibleand a politician is regarded more for his ambition than for his sense of duty , such simple notions have become absurd.  --  Sir ? Ludo asked , more troubled than ever before . How can you say this to me ? How could I say that to my men ? How can a soldier think that and still keep his sanity ?  --  No sane man can afford to think anything else in this century , the general said . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead are not ennobled by their sacrifice alone . They can be simply a waste . Ludo watched and listened and wondered if the general knew that Lala too was dead . He thought that he did . The irony would be too cruel otherwise . Yet how could he continue to resist an idea that he himself had begun to believe ? As though the thought had crossed from his mind to the general 's , Prus laid his artificial hand on Ludo 's shoulder and touched his cheek with the back of his glove.  --  I want to spare you the pain of finding that out for yourself when it 's too late for you to do anything about it.  --  It . . . may be already too late , sir , Ludo said.  |p218Prus  , always a complex man to be admired with caution , noddedand said nothing more . The second conversation of the night that he remembered was one he overheard in the dense crowd of pilots , visitors , and corespondentsgathered around the bar , where Jacek Gemba was pouring whiskeys , pink gins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken first , and then Jacek 's impassioned exclamation :  --  I 'd follow him to hell ! There 's never been a better officer in the service.  --  With that kind of reputation , he ought to run for public office , Loomis said , and Derek Bellancourt smiled and said quietly : Oh ? Do you really think so ? And does he take his morningexercise by walking upon the waters ?  --  He likes to take walks , Jacek Gemba said.  --  How introspective of him , Derek said and laughed . But it 's all done on dry land , I expect.  --  Why the hostility ? Loomis asked . What 's he done to you ? It 's pretty damn clear what he 's doing for you , so why the bitchy cracks ?  --  Sheer envy , I suppose , Derek said and smiled disarmingly.  --  Is there something official about your interest in him ? I mean , you and your Minister do n't usually go to visit your Continentaldependents with bottles of French champagne . Nor does your Minister ask any old Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is purely personal , Derek said , laughing yet sounding as though laughter was a tactical exercise for him . I collect antiques . It 's one of the interests I share with my sister . You might call it a family obsession . But I will say that some of his . . . ah . . . Continental doings have made him rather interesting . We 're always looking for men among our allies who could be useful to us.  --  I ca n't see how much more useful he could be.  --  Oh , that , Derek said . Oh , of course . But one does have to keep the future in mind . One wonders , you see , how much of a political following he 'd have if , let 's say , something happened to General Sikorski . Would his people follow him into paths they might not entirely understand ? There are so many questions.  |  --  You have n't been reading my stories , Loomis said.  --  Oh , I would n't miss one of them , Derek said . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane to fly . And when is he going to start raising the dead ? It would solve so many of our replacement problems . The third conversation , one he 'd never be able to forget entirely , was with Frantisek , the Czech hero of this British hour , who seldom spoke to anyone at all . Of all the extraordinary young men who flew with the Polish squadrons , Frantisek was probably unique . The war that he was fighting did n't seem to have much to do with the one in which the rest of Europe was engaged . He had no respect for discipline , air tactics , formations , or orders from the ground ; he exasperated the commanders of all the Britishsquadrons to which he was attached because he 'd break away and take off on his own at the first sight of Germans , whom he 'd attack and fight no matter what the odds , disdaining all help . The Poles , whom he joined at his own request , allowed him to fly with them as a guest of the squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased him . The day 's great victory had confirmed him as the champion Emil-killer of the RAF and he was celebrating it in his own fashion , playing solitaire at the card table that had been set up for him permanently in the mess . The game was a complicated one of his own invention . It took several days to finish . He 'd return to his card table after every mission . A woman ( wife ? daughter ? secretary-mistress ? ) of one of the distinguished visitors , an exquisitely gowned and coiffured lady in her middle years , had just ended congratulating him on his seventeenconfirmed kills as Ludo came up to them , and the Czech 's mild gaze had thrown her into some confusion.  --  But surely there must be some satisfaction in doing your job so well ? she insisted , and he said : I leave that sort of thing to my Polish friends.  --  But do n't you have anything to avenge ?  --  Not since Munich , madam , the Czech said . You do rememberMunich ? That 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , of course , said the lady . A terrible pity . So many of us were so sorry for the poor , brave Czechs.  --  There were some people in Prague who were equally sorry , the Czech said . But one ca n't really share one 's sorrow , can one . It does n't travel well.  --  Whatever could you mean by that ? the lady said , grown haughty . What an extraordinary thing to say !  --  It 's quite an experience to fight in another country , wearing a foreign uniform , taking orders from people who do n't understand anything about you and care even less . People who , by the way , may have had much to do with the fact that you do n't have a country . You develop quite an extraordinary viewpoint.  --  Well , said the lady . I must say , you 're not very gracious . Or grateful . After all , Britain did take you in.  --  Gratitude is n't in my contract , the Czech said . All I am paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How . . . utterly shocking . She swept away , head held high , and Frantisek bent over his cards again.  --  If you 'd put the jack of hearts on the queen , you 'd be able to pick up an entire row , Ludo said behind him.  --  Oh , you know my game , do you ? the Czech said.  --  I 've watched you play often enough . A bit hard on the lady , were n't you ?  --  She 'll get over it . She 'll just put it down to another primitive Slav , another bloody little Continental . Ca n't expect decent manners from any of them , you know.  --  We 've all learned the lessons of appeasement , Ludo said as evenly as he could . What is past is past and no apology can repair the damage , but there 'll be no more Munichs.  --  Well , we 'll just have to wait and see , wo n't we , the Czech said with a smile in which pain seemed as evident as amusement . The British are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly generous to a defeated enemy , but they do tend to be rather carelesswith their friends . Thoughtfully , Ludo looked up then and at a distance , standing beside Prus and General Sikorski , he saw Ann.  |p221THE  RECEPTION , SO ordinary if one was used to gatherings of thiskind , had been going on for some time when she came into the room . She waited quietly in a corner while Romuald Modelski hurried off to bring her a glass of champagne , and she watched the animated little groups of uniformed men and handsomely gowned women and listened to the brittle scraps of their conversations . No one , it seemed , was able to talk about anything other than the war , or people and events connected with the series of political and military disasters which had occurred in Africa and Europe . Loomis , perhaps pretending to be drunker than he was , was also the loudest in a group centered about Ludo . She watched her past-and-future lover 's tall , straight back , noted the overlong hair that seemed to have grayed heavily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had arranged her own invitation . She knew that when she finally came face-to-face with Ludo , she would n't be able to abandon her own defensive brittleness for some time . He , she was sure , would continue to seek cover in taciturn evasion , as he was doing with Loomis . It was , she thought , in the normal order of relationships where two people , each confronting an unexpected hope , resist reality so as to avoid future disappointment and a new sense of loss . In the meantime , she listened to his words and thought them soft and blurry , like lights in a fog.  --  What are you after , anyway , Loomis ? he asked . And the American , struggling to hold in place the lines of selfindulgencethat marred and masked his face , said : Would you believe . . . decency ? Prus took her by the arm then and led her to the small group gathered around General Sikorski , a group that included John Laidlaw , Brigadier Wadsworth-Jones , Sikorski 's wife and daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Foreign Minister of the Czechoslovak govern/ment ) , and her own brother Derek . She had a moment to study them all on her way toward them , and she could see at once why Winston Churchill , whom she had known from her earliest days of childhood as her father 's confidant and friend , would find the Polish leader impossible to deal with . Churchill 's overwhelming desire to dominate resulted in a feeling of inferiority in regard to anyone in whom he could see no flaw , and when that took place there was no limit to his vindictiveness and wrath . He had always feared people to whom ambition was secondary to service . The Pole 's probity and selfless dedication would be an affront to him . Introduced , and exchanging the expected complimentary phrases , she was struck by the untroubled clarity of his gaze in which , by a paradox she thought typically Polish , innocence and arrogance negated each other . A handsome , well-fleshed man , and erect as all his military kind , he seemed both appealing and forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the same odd detachment . And suddenly she wanted to shock and shake them all , to assertherself while there was still time . Laidlaw 's bland , diplomatic smile sent lines from Blake running through her mind , lines about a smile of love and a smile of deceit , and a smile of smiles in which two smiles meet . A warning ? A reminder of the past ? All her distrust of Laidlaw returned in a rush , yet she had to admit to herself that his command of surreptitious power excited and attractedher enormously . If all her other men had proved to be , sooner or later , civilized artifacts of doubtful provenance , having been brought up to polite mediocrity , he ( at the very least ) was a genuine barbarian . She was still her own woman ; she had n't yet become his arrangerof aristocratic atmospheres ( indeed , she wondered how anyone could arrange anything that might impress Sikorski ) , althoughthis evening would be the start of it . She could still react with affection to people she liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Ludo looked up , saw her , and she was immediatelyconfused . One expects joy at such times . One assumes amazement . One does n't expect resignation , as if something terriblyimportant were being laid aside . Everyone was listening attentivelyto General Sikorski , who was outlining his vision of a postwarEurope  --  a powerful Central European Federation based onp223the union of Poland and Czechoslovakia , under a joint Constitutionthat had just been agreed upon by Sikorski and the Czech President Benes  --  but all she could think of was : Why does he look so stricken ? Where 's that bright flash of recognition , of anticipatedpleasure , of acceptance ? Thrown off stride , she listened to the others.  --  This may be the most important political idea in Europe since Bismarck unified the German states , Jan Masaryk was saying . Russia , of course , will oppose it , which means that America 's leftists will attack it . But it may really put an end , once and forever , to German and Soviet expansionist ambitions.  --  Did n't Marshal Pilsudski have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Poland 's neighbors opposed it .  --  And Britain opposed it more than anyone , Masaryk said .  --  It seemed . . . premature , Laidlaw said.  --  It was premature , said General Sikorski . The successor states , as you call them , those that reappeared on the map after the disintegrationof the Austrian , Prussian , and Russian empires , were too intoxicated with their own new statehoods to accept submergencein another , greater political entity . Pilsudski 's federalist dream seemed like a new imperialism . And the Old Man himself did n't help matters very much in London and Paris.  --  He was . . . unusual , to say the least , Laidlaw agreed.  --  He was too impatient , General Sikorski said . He had little sympathy for other people 's feelings , and he wanted all his dreams accepted without explanation . That sort of dictatorial stance frightened all of us . All of us , you see  --  Poles , Czechs , Hungarians , Roumanians , Bulgarians , Lithuanians , Letts , and Estonians  --  hadonly just struggled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together out of three oppressive foreigntyrannies . Consensus was impossible . Anything that seemed a threat to independence was anathema . And yet , deep in our hearts , we 've always understood that we could have independence only as part of a political union that was powerful enough to defendall and each of us.  --  Once Germany is defeated and the Nazis are gone , Laidlaw began with a reassuring gesture ; and General Sikorski smiled at Masaryk and said : Then there will be Russia.  --  Czechoslovakia 's natural ally , Laidlaw added quickly.  |  --  Czechoslovakia 's most unnatural ally , the Czech statesman said . There wo n't be any need for such alliances once Poland has a government we can respect and trust . As we trust and respect the government of General Sikorski.  --  Oh , of course , of course , Laidlaw said at once.  --  And once we 're all part of a powerful federation , we wo n't need to depend on protection from outside , the Czech said , still smiling . Recent times have taught us that such protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applaud such a possibility , Laidlaw murmured in a voice that Ann thought particularlyhollow . And then General Sikorski was asking Prus to bring Ludo to them , so that he might congratulate him in person and thank him for his work . She studied Ludo then , as earlier she had studied General Sikorski , noting changes and wondering if they were for the better . It had been only eight weeks since they had seen each other , but she herself felt aged by months , if not years . Had he aged at all ? The lines driven sharply past the corners of his mouth seemed deeper , darker ; his cheekbones seemed sharper ; there seemed to be a small tremor in the hand he raised in salute . But all that may have been the fault of insufficient light . War , which to her was a mindless , wasteful aberration that went against all logic and reason , was his element , she knew , and yet he too seemed to have been worn down to the core . What had made him and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was their ability to fight a personal war while everyone else was simply caught up in , and struggling against , a great chaotic public donnybrook that did n't seem to mean more than the death of friends . They , the Poles , died too , of course . But , somehow , one did n't notice that so readily . She supposed that if someone mourned in a foreign language , and observed a ritual of grief rooted in the historical experience of another culture , it did n't seem quite real to anyone else . He would depend on affection to help him through his days but , as the war saw to it that therep225were always fewer persons for whom he could care , he would avoid and evade lasting emotional commitments . It was n't the most promising basis for that necessary mutual disarmament with which loving relationships begin or resume . Still , she would try , she knew . She was moved , pleased , and felt a touch of proprietary pride at the way in which powerful men deferred to her lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth as to seem paternal . He , Masaryk , and the King had all decorated Ludo , and she wondered why Ludo seemed more embarrassed than honored by his new distinction . Prus , when she glanced at him , seemed equally embarrassed . Laidlaw 's eyes seemed particularlywatchful . Alone sometime later , with the generals and ministers preparing to leave , and with the journalists and pilots looking as if they were going to make a night of it , she took Ludo by the arm and led him outside . Night had come . The Royal Couple and their entourage were long gone . The sky was red above London , where the day 's fires were burning . He smiled at her and she thought : It 'll be all right . His disappointing reaction to seeing her had been just a moment of uncertainty , shock , all perfectly human . Some disbelief , a touch of doubt , perhaps , and who could blame anyone for that in times such as these ? Something was troubling him , perhaps a new choice that had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to a moral and spiritual crossroad where he had to pause , look back over the distances he had crossed , and scan his horizons . In a time of violent and dramaticchanges , what could be more natural ? Looking at her , he shook his head over and over , as if to clear it of persistent cobwebs , and rubbed his forehead with the gloved fingers of his injured hand.  --  I do n't understand this , he said finally.  --  What 's there to understand ? There is an awkwardness about renewed relationships , a wary ritual of maneuvering for position , of testing the air , of wondering if hopes may be justified or if barricades were necessary after all . She was appalled by her own stilted tone.  |  --  You said you liked surprises now and then . But he was listening only to himself.  --  Do you believe in coincidences ? Destiny ? Things like that ?  --  Take my word for it , lover , Ann said . There 's no such thing as a coincidence . God has it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . illogical , he said.  --  What does logic have to do with anything ? If she felt it necessary to shield her nervousness with harshness , his refuge seemed to lie in the destruction of the English language.  --  But in France , it was all finished , no ? And that was logical , yes ? So why should I remember you ? Why should I be reminded ? But everywhere I go I am reminded of you , and I think about you . Ann , it is not a good way to be in a war . She laughed then , honestly and with no artifice of any kind.  --  Poor Ludo , she said . English is always your first victim when you lose control of the situation . But there 's really nothing to be alarmed about . France was . . . France . We did n't have a proper fare-thee-well . The lady took flight , I 'm afraid . So here we are again , given another chance to repeat our mistakes , and if that 's not part of someone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little lessons.  --  It is still all too much for me to understand , Ludo said .  --  Think less , she coined a parody . The gates of paradise are narrow . Humorless , as he seemed to her at times , he could n't follow her into imprecise images or ideas , so he asked , somewhat puzzled : What does thinking have to do with narrow gates ?  --  People with swollen heads get stuck in them , she said . Heaven is for the simpleminded . Well . . . let 's see the new gongs . That 's the RAF word for them , is n't it ? Ludo groped for and found the black oblong leather case in his tunic pockets , passed them to Ann , who opened them , took out the small enameled crosses , and cocked her head over them.  --  That one I know , she said . It 's the DSO , is n't it ? Patrick has one . This other one . . . is there some significance to the fact that the ribbon is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simplicity and perhaps an innocence that she found endearing . Such light **25;10804;TOOLONG as the English language could provide were , occasionally , beyond him.  --  It 's Polish , the Virtuti Militari , he said.  --  Granted for military virtues , I expect . I see you 're wearing another one of them . Have you been very virtuous to get them ?  --  Only in the military way , he said finally and began to grin in his turn.  --  Thank God for that , Ann said . Yes , she thought , it will be all right . It will be . Otherwise , everythingwill have been only a coincidence , and who 'd need any more of those ? London was glowing redly on the near horizon , sound rolled there like thunder , and the thin white beams of searchlights were sweeping the sky . There had to be a reason for something as unspeakable as that , it had to be a part of God 's sensible plan ; otherwise she 'd be obliged to think that everything was merely a cruel accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own unreasonably reawakened hopes ) would make life ... unendurable . Could he leave the base ? Yes , if he were back before dawn . Victory or not , the squadrons were n't on stand down , they 'd fly in the morning . Indeed , even as they ( Ann and Ludo ) ran through the sudden rain toward the visitors ' parking area behind the mess building , as the rest of the night began to acquire that aura of expectancy that quickens the blood , the party had begun to end . The correspondents and the ground-echelon officers would go on drinking , singing their schoolboy songs , playing their complicated games of soccer among piled-up furniture , walking on their hands . The pilots walked to quarters . Then , as they squeezed themselves into the bucket seats of Derek 's Morgan racer ( with Ludo 's long legs cruelly angled and wedged under his chin ) , she had a sudden sensation of deja vu . She had been here before , had done this before in this very car , driving from a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a sharp rain that angled right into the windshield , obscuring the dark road ; watching the needle nudge the hundred mark as she bit her lips . Life expectancy could be mea/sured in seconds at such times . Death . . . silence , peace , an end to hopelessness and frenzy . . . would be instantaneous .. . Ludo 's sharp white profile looked like something chiseled out of chalk . He seemed indifferent to his fate which , at that moment , lay entirely in her hands , or ( to conjure up the precise image , the mot juste ) under her foot on the accelerator . Would nothing move him ? Was he beyond the simplicities of fear ? And of what use would such a man be to her ? The damned man was an affront to everything that she had been taught to believe about herself and yet she knew , even then , that he had come to his authority through pain . The risks such men were taught to take were never an investment . The touch of his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning and commanding , was ( she thought ) infinitelysoothing . She took a deep breath , expelled it , watched the speed-indicator needle drop.  --  That , she said quietly , in control again . That is known as doing the tonne . One hundred or better.  --  Interesting , he said and she was free to laugh.  --  Tell me about your trip through Spain , she said then . Was it very difficult ?  --  Yes , he said . It was . How was yours ?  --  Nothing to press into a memory book . Oily food , horny Spaniards , and lecherous Catalonian waiters . Madrid was a bore . Full of sauntering Nazis and anxious Jews and greasy little men talking about Spain 's right to Gibraltar . He paused then , choosing his words with care : My journey almostended in Madrid . I saw a man there that I had met in a hospital in Warsaw . He is the man who put me in that hospital . A German . His name is Reinecke.  --  You have a German friend ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your line of work ?  --  He 's not a friend , not exactly . In fact , he is my Enemy , the one that I look for every day . As he looks for me . Both of us know , I think , that nothing is going to happen to either of us until we find each other in the air . I know this may be difficult to understand , but that 's what I think.  |  --  I 've had some such ideas myself , she said . Go on.  --  In Madrid , we saw each other . He was in a cafe near the Prado , having coffee and cognac with some Spanish officers . I was outside , in the crowd , on my way from one railway station to another , and I caught his eye . He winked at me . He smiled . I do n't know how he recognized me or knew who I was . The only time he had seen me , my face was wrapped in bandages . And I was , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Spanish street.  --  More onions ? she said.  --  What ? he said , distracted . What onions ?  --  Nothing , she said . Never mind . Go on.  --  How could he have known who I was ? He must have sensed what I felt . He must feel what I do . He must know what he and I are to each other in this war.  --  Perhaps he saw your photograph somewhere , Ann said quietly , and waited , and then there was a silence.  --  That 's possible , of course , Ludo said at last . They keep intelligencefiles on some of us , just as we do on them . . . . But that was n't the feeling I had at the time . I do n't know if I 'm making myself clear , but something very personal happened in that moment.  --  Go on , she said.  --  There was a shock , a moment of tension , Ludo said and shook his head and searched for better words . No . There was more than that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miracle takes place in air combat . It 's when you know that you are sitting dead center in somebody 's gunsight , and that there 's nothing you 'll be able to think of fast enough to save yourselfbefore you are hit , and that before you can begin to move you 're going to be dead . Everything stands absolutely still . The air itself seems solid . There is no time to think . Indeed , there is n't any time . The mind tunes out and some entirely different force takes over , and suddenly you are saved . How ? What happens ? I do n't know . But , I suppose , once you stop thinking you can move by instinct , and what you do by instinct must always be right.  --  It seems to work that way sometimes , Ann murmured.  --  Yes , well , Ludo said . That 's what happened then . We sawp230each other and each of us recognized that feeling . It was .. . ( and here he hesitated as if embarrassed by the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , if you can believe it . Very softly , Ann said : I do recall one or two such moments . But he was not listening to her then . Quite likely , he was hardly able to hear himself . He had stepped away from the conversationand was tap-tapping blindly down the dark path of his memory , moving reluctantly through the jumble of debris and deadfall that lay concealed behind his blue-green lenses . She could n't follow him into all that wreckage , she knew , and find her way out again . Then he was laughing nervously.  --  An odd thing to have happened between enemies , do n't you think ?  --  Perhaps not so odd , she prompted.  --  No . Well . My journey should have ended there and then . But he obviously decided to save me for another time . Impatient ( she was easily bored by mystifications ) , Ann said : That makes you sound like something one keeps in a larder.  --  That 's it , exactly , Ludo said . Sooner or later , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Now that is sick , Ann said and went on to lament only half in jest : Why do I attract twisted , honorable romantics ? I had thought better of you.  --  I know . I 'm sorry . But that 's what happened , you see.  --  He 's keeping you alive so that you can kill him , or he can kill you , you , in some sort of medieval battle in the skies ? Pardon the confusedmetaphor , but there 's a limit to what I 'm willing to swallow in a bedtime story.  --  We knew it in Warsaw , Ludo said.  --  Nothing that happens there would surprise me , Ann said . But this is London . People do n't think like that at this end of Europe.  --  I heard him , Ludo said . He grinned from ear to ear and he said : By the lost and found balls of Saint Anthony , how many lives have you got ? Then he distracted the others with a joke in Spanish and I could step back into the crowd.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nobody talks like that .  --  He does . And I knew exactly what he meant.  |  --  Well . . . that 's just sick , Ann said . I do n't want to hear that kind of a story.  --  I do n't have any other kind , Ludo said . Later , with the lovemaking over for the moment , the windows glowing red with the distant fires , and the beginning of a morningchill creasing about her back and shoulders , she said : Tell me about Portugal . Did you really steal a ship or a plane , or whatever it was ?  --  A plane in Lisbon . A ship in Casablanca . There 's really not much more to say about that . She laughed , not really amused : Are you being modest ? Please do n't become all English and modest . I told you what I think about that . He shrugged , spread his hands , not at all displeased.  --  I stole a whole squadron in Poland , he said.  --  That 's more like it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . That should stand you in good stead in London.  --  Ann , he said and yawned . Could n't we get some sleep ? She sat up among the tumbled pillows , said accusingly : Sometimesyou sound more English than the Hudsons.  --  I like your cousin , he said.  --  You 've met Wally Hudson ? Yes , I suppose you would . He does have his moments , which is more than I can say for most of my abominable family.  --  At least you have one , Ludo said.  --  Is that important to you ? she wanted to know . You seem to be a man who does well enough alone . Once more evasive , he said : It is n't a state I 'd have chosen .  --  All right , then , she said . Keep your secrets . But there is one more story I 'd like to know about . It 's a murder story.  --  Which kind of murder ? he asked bitterly . The kind for which you go to hell , or the kind for which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of both , Ann said carefully . It 's someone you 're supposed to have murdered in that hospital in Warsaw . To switch identities , or something.  --  How . . . , he began and she , retreating from the numb fury in his face , said quickly , soothingly : It 's a story Derek broughtp232back from Lisbon . It 's something the Germans have been floating , I believe.  --  Oh , the swine , Ludo said . He plucked the blue-green glasses off his nose with a swift , desperategesture and she could see his eyes . The whites had yellowed , they were veined in red , and she thought ( very frightenednow ) of old parchment maps , the kind one finds behind glass in museum cases . Here be Dragons , here be Monsters , and here the Navigator has fallen off the edge of the world . . . . She thought that she had never seen pain stamped so indelibly into flesh ; it was as if a butcher 's mallet had struck him between the eyes and shattered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's just a German story . Why are you so upset ? Nobody pays attention to any German stories.  --  The swine are trying to pay me back for that funeral , Ludo was muttering then . Oh , the sons-of-bitches ! No wonder Reinecke was amused.  --  I do n't know anything about funerals , Ann said . I only know the story 's being mentioned here and there in some official places . . . . It 's the sort of dirty little trick that Derek would pull , you see , and it 's not something that anyone would do anything about . . . not normally , anyway.  --  No , not normally.  --  I 'm sorry , she said then . I should n't have brought it up . Why are you so angry ?  --  Angry ? he said and uttered a short , barking laugh . It 's an entirely different kind of feeling.  --  Because I do understand that sort of thing , she said.  --  You 're English , he said , cold as ice . Why should you have to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own.  --  Have n't you heard about slander ? Defamation ? she asked harshly and made a snorting sound of bitterness and contempt . There are whole peoples who make a wonderfully comfortable livingfor themselves out of lying about others ! It 's the only way that petty little men have of coping with someone bigger than themselves . If they did not tell their damned lies about you , if they could n't gossip with their knowing smiles and make all their gleeful little comments about how undeserving you really are , ifp233they could n't reassure themselves about their own stature by pullingyou down to their slimy little level , it would mean that you 're just as dull and small and cowardly and unimportant as they are ! I ought to know something about slander , damn it . And I do . He said nothing and she went on in a softer tone , feeling unaccountablyexhausted : Perhaps it helps them to master their own consciences . And if yours does n't bother you .. . He interrupted coldly .  --  Why should it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry ?  --  A man who does n't care about his own good name is n't going to be concerned about anyone else , he said . She could laugh then , mocking gently.  --  Believe me , lover . Slander is something you never learn to live with . Not entirely . But it does get easier year by year . And can it really make all that much of a difference in the end ? But she was quite sure then that he was unable to see her . He was staring through her and beyond her into some icy moment where she could n't follow , and she thought once again of antique maps and legendary monsters and of a voyager lost at the far edge of his possibilities . Outside , a lost homeless dog had begun to howl , its voice mad with hunger , and the rain went on tapping and scratching at the windows like a wet gray beggar . Later , he slept . She watched him as he turned and muttered in a nightmare and time seemed to be roaring in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself as much as to him . It 's all right . When the main nightmare passes , the small ones will end.  |p237THAT  WINTER , as Ann would seek to understand it later , and then through the next year into the spring and summer of 1942 , the war began to acquire a darker life and destiny of its own . It prospered with little seeming relevance to the fates of thousands killed in North Africa , in the skies above Britain and northwesternFrance , in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and the North Sea and the Indian Ocean , and  --  soon enough  --  in the Far East and on the Russian landmass . The war grew and spread ; it maimed , murdered , and imprisonedtens of millions in occupied Europe , buried thousands in the rubble of their London homes . It slaughtered openly and it killed in secret . It plotted and manipulated and connived . Its face  --  so bright with a heroic purpose at the start  --  darkened with treachery , brutality , and greed . Headlines . . . there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italian armies swept back and forth across the sands of Libya . The French fleet was attacked without warning by its erstwhile allies and sunk at anchor at Dakar . In April 1941 , the war consumed Yugoslavia and the Greeks . Thanks to Winston Churchill 's fascination with the soft underbelly of Europe , twenty thousand Australians and New Zealanders were sent to destruction in Greece and in Crete just at the point when they were about to annihilate Italy 's North Africanempire . On June 22 , the war engulfed Hitler 's eastern partner  --  the Russian Colossus  --  with results that would doom Ludo and his kind . In December 1941 , when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor redefined the war and gave it a new American identity , the threat to Poland 's future could be seen quite clearly by those among the Poles whose business it was to know about such things . They were aware of American ignorance about them ; they were soon to become very much aware of the hysterical adulation by which a highly vocal leftist minority in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libertariansp238who still addressed their prayers to Lenin and Trotsky  --  transformedthe murderous Joseph Stalin into a benign Uncle foe , and all witnesses against him into fascists . Yet if one were to believe the headlines of the times , then all of the Allies , not merely the Poles , seemed to be heading for catastrophein that season of disasters . The British Empire fell apart in Asia . Hong Kong was lost . India was in turmoil . Malaya and Singapore , along with a British-Indian army of eighty thousand men , fell to a small corps of twenty thousand Japanese . The Royal Navy 's Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk by Japanese bombers , and the heavy cruisers Cornwall and Dorsetshire followedsoon after in the Bay of Bengal . Thirty-six thousand Americanand Filipino troops marched into Japanese captivity with the surrender of Bataan on April 9 , 1942 . Corregidor fell on May 6 . In North Africa , the fortress of Tobruk surrendered to the Germanson June 21 , along with nine generals , forty thousand seasoned British and Australian soldiers , and mountains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Marshal and darling of the German Army ) prepared to invade Egypt . On the same day , which marked the first anniversary of their invasion of the Soviet Union , General von Manstein 's soldiers broke through the defenses of Sevastopol , drove the Russians out of the Crimea , and began their advance to the Caucasus and the lower Volga . As Ludo said bitterly to Ann , it was a fine year for wooden and enameled crosses . It was n't a good year for a warm and loving relationship to flower and grow . In her bed , in her bath , on Derek 's Persian carpets , jammed against the refrigerator in her kitchen , in theater cloakrooms , in the backseats of taxis and across the hood of her borrowed sportscar , in country lanes and hedgerows , once in a train compartment , they fell on each other with the desperate savagery of a bayonet charge across open ground , as if to assert , once and for all , their simple human triumph over a sinister and disembodied war that continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe , and as less attention was paid to the bright clear-cut purpose of the war 's beginning , and more to its darkening and demeaning nature , so their assault on eachp239other 's bodies acquired an opposite , fundamental intensity , as if to reaffirm an earlier stage in human evolution . But if their nights were right , they knew that their days were terribly wrong , and there seemed to be nothing that they could do about it . He told her the story of a 1919 cavalry charge in the Ukraine , a hopelessly romantic gesture in the face of barbed wire and machineguns , where , in the midst of unbelievable carnage , the stallionsof the officers began to mount the mares of the privates in some sort of primordial spasm of affirmation of life over death . ( It knocked the charge into a cocked hat , of course , but Holy Mother of God , what better time to preserve the species ? The poor damned brutes died grinning from ear to ear . ) She did n't laugh . Indeed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only a story , Ann , he tried to console her.  --  I hate that kind of story . It 's ugly , cruel , and degrading . It reduceseverything to animal functions . And it 's not even true !  --  It happened , Ann . I was there . Prus was also there . Ask him , if you ca n't believe me.  --  I do n't care whether it happened or not ! Just because it happenedwould n't make it true ! Oh , do n't pretend that you do n't know what I 'm talking about . It 's all so . . . diminishing . Things are confused enough between us without that sort of thing.  --  I 'm not confused about us , he said . I know exactly what I feel.  --  Oh , yes , she said bitterly . Whenever you can afford to think about something other than the war !  --  It is n't something one can forget these days , is it ? he did his best to soothe her . But I think about you as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment from you ? Bed is all very well , but . . . dear God . . . even that 's beginning to feel like a historical transaction . I 've been trying to understand this distance between us ever since we met . My own commitments depend on it , you see . If you and I could achieve that necessary closeness . . . if you could meet me at least halfway . . . if I thought I could depend on you and not be left stranded in an emotional vacuum from which there 's no way out . . . I 'd be **27;10831;TOOLONG made no answer . He stood looking at Christine , his eyes burning , his head slightly down . The windshield had been smashed through in two places ; handfuls of safety glass fragments were strewn across the slashed seat covers like trumpery diamonds . Half of the front bumper had been pried off and now dragged on the pavement , near a snarl of black wires like octopus tentacles . Three of the four side windows had also been broken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at waist-level in ragged , wavering lines . It looked as if some sharp , heavy instrument  --  maybe the pry-end of a tire iron  --  had been used . The passenger door hung open , and she saw that all the dashboard glass had been broken . Tufts and wads of stuffing were everywhere . The speedometer needle lay on the driver 's side floormat . Arnie walked slowly around his car , noting all of this . Leigh spoke to him twice . He did n't answer either time . Now the leaden color of his face was broken by two hectic , burning spots of flush riding high up on his cheekbones . He picked up the octopus-thing that had been lying on the pavement and she saw it was a distributor cap  --  her father had pointed that out to her once when he had been tinkering with their car . He looked at it for a moment , as if examining an exotic zoological specimen , and then threw it down . Broken glass gritted under their heels . She spoke to him again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible pity for him , she began to feel afraid , too . She told Dennis Guilder later that it seemed  --  at least at the time  --  perfectly possible that he might have lost his mind . He booted a piece of chrome trim out of his way . It struck the cyclonefence at the back of the lot with a little tinkling sound . The taillights had been smashed , more trumpery gems , this time rubies , this time on the pavement instead of the seat . " Arnie  --  " she tried again . He stopped . He was looking in through the hole in the driver 's side window . A terrible low sound began to come from his chest , a jungle sound . She looked over his shoulder , saw , and suddenly felt a crazy need to laugh and scream and faint all at the same time . On the dashboard . . . she had n't noticed at first ; in the midst of the general destructionshe had n't noticed what was on the dashboard . And she wondered , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low , so completely low , as to do such a thing , to . " Shifters ! " Arnie cried , and his voice was not his own . It was high and shrill and cracked with fury . Leigh turned around and threw up , holding blindly onto the car nextp201to Christine , seeing small white dots in front of her eyes that expanded like puffed rice . Dimly she thought of the county fair  --  every year they 'd haul an old junk car up onto a plank platform and lean a sledgehammer against it and you got three swings for a quarter . The idea was to demolishthe car . But not . . . not to . . . " You goddam shitters ! " Arnie screamed . " I 'll get you ! I 'll get you if it 's the last thing I do ! If it 's the last motherfucking thing I ever do ! " Leigh threw up again and for one terrible moment found herself wishing that she had never ever met Arnie Cunningham . Would you like to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to go ridingIn my Buick ' 59 ? It 's got two carburetorsAnd a supercharger up the side.  --  The MedallionsHe let himself into the house that night at quarter of twelve . The clothes he had been wearing with the shopping trip to Pittsburgh in mind were grease- and sweat-stained . His hands were more deeply grimed , and a shallow cut corkscrewed across the back of the left like a brand . His face looked haggard and stunned . There were dark circles under his eyes . His mother sat at the table , a game of solitaire laid out in front of her . She had been waiting for him to come home and dreading it deeply at the same time . Leigh had called and told her what had happened . The girl , who had impressed Regina as being quite a nice girl ( if perhapsnot quite good enough for her son ) , sounded as if she had been crying . Regina , alarmed , had hung up as quickly as she could and had dialled Darnell 's Garage . Leigh had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden in with the driver . He had put her in a taxi , over her protests . The phone had rung twice and then a wheezy yet gravelly voice had said , " Yuh . Darnell's. "  |p202She  had hung up , realizing it would be a mistake to talk to him there  --  and it looked as if she and Mike had already made enough mistakes about Arnie and his car . She would wait until he came home . Say what she had to say looking him in the face . She said it now . " Arnie , I 'm sorry . " It would have been better if Mike could be here , too . But he was in Kansas City , attending a symposium on trade and the beginnings of free enterprise in the Middle Ages . He would n't be back until Sunday , unlessthis brought him home early . She thought it might . She realized  --  not without some rue  --  that she might just be awakening to the full seriousness of this situation . " Sorry , " Arnie echoed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , we  --  " She could n't go on . There was something terriblein the deadwood of his expression . His eyes were blanks . She could only look at him and shake her head , her eyes brimming , the hateful taste of tears in her nose and throat . She hated to cry . Strong-willed , one of two girls in a Catholic family that consisted of her blue-collar construction-worker father , her washed-out mother , and seven brothers , hellbent on college in spite of her father 's belief that the only things girls learned there was how to stop being virgins and how to throw over the church , she had shed her fair share of tears and more . And if her own family thought she was hard sometimes , it was because they did n't understand that when you went through hell you came out baked by the fire . And when you had to burn to have your own way , you always wanted to have it . " You know something ? " Arnie asked . She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears under her lids . " You 'd make me laugh , if I was n't so tired I could hardly stand up . You could have been out there swinging the tire irons and the hammers along with the guys that did it . You 're probably happier about it than they are . " " Arnie , that 's not fair ! " " It is fair ! " he roared at her , his eyes suddenly blazing with a horriblefire . For the first time in her life she was afraid of her son . " Your idea to get it out of the driveway ! His idea to put it in the airport lot ! Who do you think is to blame here ? Just who do you think ? Do you think it would have happened if it had been here ? Huh ? " He took a step toward her , fists clenched at his sides , and she had all she could do to keep from flinching backward.  | " Arnie , ca n't we even talk about this ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them took a shit on the dashboard of my car , " he said coldly . " How 's that for rational , Mom ? " She had honestly believed she had the tears under control , but this news  --  news of such a stupid , irrational fury  --  brought them back . She cried . She cried in grief for what her son had seen . She lowered her head and cried in bewilderment and pain and fear . All her life as a mother she had felt secretly superior to the women around her who had children older than Arnie . When he was one , those other mothers had shaken their heads dolefully and told her to wait until he was five  --  that was when the trouble started , that was when they were old enough to say " shit " in front of their grandmothers and play with matches when left alone . But Arnold , as good as gold at one , had still been as good as gold at five . Then the other mothers had rolled their eyes and said wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen , that was when it really got sticky , what with the dope and the rock concerts and girls that would do anything and  --  God forbid  --  stealing hubcaps and those . . . well , diseases . And through it all she had continued to smile inside because it was all working out according to plan , it was all working out the way she felt her own childhood should have . Her son had warm , supportive parentswho cared about him , who would give him anything ( within reason ) , who would gladly send him to the college of his choice ( as long as it was a good one ) , thereby finishing the game/business/vocation of Parenting with a flourish . If you had suggested that Arnie had few friends and was often bullyragged by the others , she would have starchilypointed out that she had gone to a parochial school in a tough neighborhood where girls ' cotton panties were sometimes torn off for a joke and then set on fire with Zippo lighters engraved with the crucified body of Jesus . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed only in terms of material goals from the attitudes of her hated father , she would have been furious and pointed out her good son as her final vindication . But now her good son stood before her , pale , exhausted , and greased to the elbows , seeming to thrum with the same sort of barely chained anger that had been his grandfather 's trademark , even looking like him . Everything seemed to have fallen into a shambles . " Arnie , we 'll talk about what 's to be done in the morning , " she said , trying to pull herself together and beat back the tears . " We 'll talk about it in the morning . "  | " Not unless you get up real early , " he said , seeming to lose interest . " I 'm going upstairs and catch about four hours , and then I 'm going down to the garage again . " " What for ? " He uttered a crazy laugh and flapped his arms under the kitchen 's fluorescent bars as if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a lot of work to do ! More work than you 'd believe ! " " No. - you have school tomorrow . . . I .. . I forbid it , Arnie , I absolutely  --  " He turned to look at her , study her , and she flinched again . This was like some grinding nightmare that was just going to go on and on . " I 'll get to school , " he said . " I 'll take some fresh clothes in a pack and I 'll even shower so I do n't smell offensive to anyone in homeroom . Then , after school 's out , I 'll go back down to Darnell 's . There 's a lot of work to be done but I can do it . . . I know I can ... it 's going to eat up a lot of my savings , though . Plus , I 'll have to keep on top of the stuff I 'm doing for Will . " " Your homework . . . your studies ! " " Oh . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clockwork figure . " They 'll suffer , of course . Ca n't kid you about that . I ca n't promise you a ninety-three average anymore , either . But I 'll get by . I can make C 's . Maybe some B 's . " " No ! You 've got college to think about ! " He came back to the table , limping again , quite badly . He planted his hands on the table before her and leaned slowly down . She thought : A stranger . . my son is a stranger to me . Is this really my fault ? Is it ? Because I only wanted what was best for him ? Can that be ? Please , God , make this a nightmare I 'll wake up from with tears on my cheeks because it was so real . " Right now , " he said softly , holding her gaze , " the only things I care about are Christine and Leigh and staying on the good side of Will Darnellso I can get her fixed up as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if you do n't get off my case , I 'll drop out of high school . That ought to shut you up if nothing else will . " " You ca n't , " she said , meeting his gaze . " You understand that , Arnold . Maybe I deserve your . . . your cruelty . . but I 'll fight this self-destructive streak of yours with everything I have . So do n't you talk about dropping out of school . " " But I 'll really do it , " he answered . " I do n't want you to even kid yourself into thinking I wo n't . I 'll be eighteen in February , and I 'll do itp205on my own then if you do n't stay out of this from now on . Do you understand me ? " " Go to bed , " she said tearfully . " Go to bed , you 're breaking my heart . " " Am I ? " Shockingly , he laughed . " Hurts , does n't it ? I know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body slightly to the left . Shortly she heard the heavy , tired clump of his shoes on the stairs  --  also a sound terribly reminiscent of her childhood , when she had thought to herself , The ogre 's going to bed . She burst into a fresh spasm of weeping , got up clumsily , and went out the back door to do her crying in private . She held herself  --  thin comfort , but better than none  --  and looked up at a horned moon that was quadrupled through the film of her tears . Everything had changed , and it had happened with the speed of a cyclone . Her son hated her ; she had seen it in his face  --  it was n't a tantrum , a temporary pique , a passing squall of adolescence . He hated her , and this was n't the way it was supposedto go with her good boy , not at all . Not at all . She stood on the stoop and cried until the tears began to run their course and the sobs became occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her mules and bit more bluntly through her housecoat . She went inside and upstairs . She stood outside Arnie 's room indecisively for almost a minute before going in . He had fallen asleep on the coverlet of his bed . His pants were still on . He seemed more unconscious than asleep , and his face looked horriblyold . A trick of the light , coming from the hall and falling into the room from over her shoulder , made it seem for a moment to her that his hair was thinning , that his sleep-gaping mouth was without teeth . A small squeal of horror strained itself through the hand clapped to her mouth and she hurried toward him . Her shadow , which had been on the bed , moved with her and she saw it was only Arnie , the impression of age no more than the light and her own exhausted confusion . She looked at his clock-radio and saw that it was set for 4:30 A.M. She thought of turning the alarm off ; she even stretched her hand out to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to her bedroom , sat down at the phone table , and picked up the handset . She held it for a moment , debating . If shecalled Mike in the middle of the night , he would think that . . That something terrible had happened ? She giggled . Well , had n't it ? It surely had . And it was still happening.  |p206She  dialled the number of the Ramada Inn in Kansas City where her husband was staying , vaguely aware that she was , for the first time since she had left the grim and grimy three-story house in Rocksburg for collegetwenty-seven years before , calling for help . I do n't want to cause no fuss , But can I buy your magic bus ? I do n't care how much I pay , I 'm gon na drive that bus to my bay-by . I want it ... I want it . . .1 want it .. . ( You ca n't have it .. . )  --  The WhoShe got through most of the story okay , sitting in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and her ankles crossed , neatly dressed in a multicolored wool sweater and a brown corduroyskirt . It was not until the end that she began to cry , and she could n't find a handkerchief . Dennis Guilder handed her the box of tissuesfrom the table beside the bed . " Take it easy , Leigh , " he said . " I cuh-cuh-ca n't ! He has n't been to see me . . . and in school he just seems so tired . . and you s-said he has n't been here  --  " " He 'll come if he needs me , " Dennis said . " You 're full of muh-macho b-bull-sh-sh-shit ! " she said , and then looked comically stunned at what she had said . The tears had cut tracks in the light makeup she was wearing . She and Dennis looked at each other for a moment , and then they laughed . But it was brief laughter , and not really that good . " Has Motormouth seen him ? " Dennis asked . " Who ? " " Motormouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guidance counsellor . " " Oh ! Yes , I think he has . He was called to the guidance office the day before yesterday  --  Monday . But he did n't say anything . And I did n't dare ask him anything . He wo n't talk . He 's gotten so strange . "  |p207Dennis  nodded . Although he did n't think Leigh realized it  --  she was deep in her own trouble and confusion  --  he felt a sense of impotence and a deepening fear for Arnie . From the reports that had filtered into his room over the last few days , Arnie sounded on the verge of a nervousbreakdown ; Leigh 's report was only the most recent and the most graphic . He had never wanted to be out as badly as he did now . Of course , he could call Vickers and ask him if there was anything he could do . And he could call Arnie . . . except , from what Leigh had said , Arnie was now always at school , at Darnell 's , or sleeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there had been another fight , Leigh had told him . Although Arnie had not come right out and said so , Leigh told Dennis she believed that he had come very close to simply leaving home . Dennis did n't want to talk to Arnie at Darnell 's . " What can I do ? " she asked him . " What would you do , in my place ? " " Wait , " Dennis said . " I do n't know what else you can do . " " But that 's hardest , " she answered in a voice so low it was almost inaudible . Her hands were clenching and unclenching on the Kleenex , shredding it , dotting her brown skirt with speckles of lint . " My folks want me to stop seeing him  --  to drop him . They 're afraid . . . that Reppertonand those other boys will do something else . " " You 're pretty sure it was Buddy and his friends , huh ? " " Yes . Everybody is . Mr. Cunningham called the police even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd settle the score in his own way , and that scared them both . It scares me , too . The police picked up Buddy Repperton , and one of his friends , the one they call Moochie . .. do you know who I mean ? " " And the boy who works nights at the airport parking lot , they picked him up , too . Galton , his name is  --  " " Sandy . " " They thought he must have been in on it , that maybe he let them in. , , " He runs with them , all right , " Dennis said , " but he 's not quite as degenerateas the rest of them . I 'll say this , Leigh  --  if Arnie did n't talk to you , someone sure did . " " First Mrs. Cunningham and then his father . I do n't think either of them knew the other one had talked to me . They 're . . " " Upset , " Dennis suggested . She shook her head . " It 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookp208like they were just . .. just mugged , or something . I ca n't really feel sorry for her  --  all she wants is her own way , I think  --  but I could cry for Mr. Cunningham . He just seems so . . . so . . . " She trailed off and then began again . " When I got there yesterday afternoon after school , Mrs. Cunningham  --  she asked me to call her Regina , but I just ca n't seem to do it  --  " Dennis grinned . " Can you do it ? " Leigh asked . " Well , yeah  --  but I 've had a lot more practice . " She smiled , the first good one of her visit . " Maybe that would make a difference . Anyway , when I went over , she was there but Mr. Cunninghamwas still at school .. . the University , I mean . " " Yeah . " " She took the whole week off  --  what there is of it . She said she could n't go back , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does she look ? " " She looks shattered , " Leigh said , and reached for a fresh Kleenex . She began shredding the edges . " She looks ten years older than when I first met her a month ago . " " And him ? Michael ? " " Older , but tougher , " Leigh said hesitantly . " As if this had somehow . . somehow gotten him into gear . " Dennis was silent . He had known Michael Cunningham for thirteen years and had never seen him in gear , so he would n't know . Regina had always been the one in gear ; Michael trailed along in her wake and made the drinks at the parties ( mostly faculty parties ) the Cunninghamshosted . He played his recorder , he looked melancholy . . . but by no stretch of the imagination could Dennis say he had ever seen the man " in gear . " The final triumph , Dennis 's father had said once , standing at the window and watching Regina lead Arnie by the hand down the Guilders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . Arnie and Dennis had been perhaps seven then . Momism supreme . I wonder if she 'll make the poor slob wait in the car when Arnie gets married . Or maybe she canDennis 's mother had frowned at her husband and shushed him by cutting her eyes at Dennis in a **29;10860;TOOLONG gesture . He never forgot the gesture or what his father had said  --  at seven he had n't understood all of it , but even at seven he knew perfectly well what a " poor slob " was . And even at seven he vaguely understood why his fathermight think Michael Cunningham was one . He had felt sad forp209Michael Cunningham . . . and that feeling had held , off and on , right up to the present . " He came in around the time she was finishing her story , " Leigh went on . " They asked me to stay for supper  --  Arnie has been eating down at Darnell 's  --  but I told them I really had to get back . So Mr. Cunningham offered me a ride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are they on different sides ? " " Not exactly , but . . . Mr. Cunningham was the one who went to see the police , for instance . Arnie did n't want to , and Mrs. Cunningham  --  Regina  --  could n't bring herself to do it . " Dennis asked cautiously , " He 's really trying to put Humpty back together again , huh ? " " Yes , " she whispered , and then burst out shrilly : " But that 's not all ! He 's in deep with that guy Darnell , I know he is ! Yesterday in period three study hall he told me he was going to drop a new front end into her  --  into his car  --  this afternoon and this evening , and I said wo n't that be awfully expensive Arnie , and he said not to worry about it because his credit was good  --  " " Slow down . " She was crying again . " His credit was good because he and someone named Jimmy Sykes were going to do some errands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And . . . I do n't think the errands he does for that sonofabitch are legal ! " " What did he tell the police when they came to ask about Christine ? " " He told them about finding it . . . that way . They asked him if he had any ideas who might have done it , and Arnie said no . They asked him if it was n't true that he had gotten into a fight with Buddy Repperton , that Repperton had pulled a knife and had been expelled for it . Arnie said that Repperton had knocked his bag lunch out of his hand and stepped on it , then Mr. Casey came over from the shop and broke it up . They asked him if Repperton had n't said he would get him for it , and Arnie said he might have said something like that , but talk was cheap . " Dennis was silent , looking out his window at a dull November sky , 11 considering this . He found it ominous . If Leigh had the interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single lie . . . but he had edited things to make what had happened in the smoking area sound ' like your ordinary pushy-pushy . Dennis found that extremely ominous . " Do you know what Arnie might be doing for that man Darnell ? " Leigh asked  | " No , " Dennis answered , but he had some ideas . A little internal tape recorder started up , and he heard his father saying , I 've heard a few things . . stolen cars . . . cigarettes and booze . . . contraband like fireworks . . . He 's been lucky for a long time , Dennis . He looked at Leigh 's face , too pale , her makeup cut open by her tears . She was hanging on , hanging onto Arnie as best she could . Maybe she was learning something about being tough that she would n't have learned otherwise , with her looks , for another ten years . But that did n't make it any easier , and it did n't necessarily make it right . It occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed the improvementin Arnie 's face more than a month before Arnie and Leigh clicked . . but after Arnie and Christine had clicked . " I 'll talk to him , " he promised . " Good , " she said . She stood up . " I  --  I do n't want things to be like they were before , Dennis . I know that nothing ever is . But I still love him , and . . . and I just wish you 'd tell him that . " " Yeah , okay . " They were both embarrassed , and neither of them could say anything for a long , long moment . Dennis was thinking that this would be the point , in a c &; w song , where the Best Friend steps in . And a sneaking , mean ( and randy ) part of him would n't be averse to that . Not at all . He was still powerfully attracted to her , more attracted than he had been to any girl in a long time . Maybe ever . Let Arnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his car . He and Leigh could get to know each other better in the meantime . A little aid and comfort . You know how it is . And he had a feeling at just that awkward moment , after her professionof love for Arnie , that he could do it ; she was vulnerable . She was maybe learning how to be tough , but it 's not a school anyone goes to willingly . He could say something  --  the right something , maybe only Come here  --  and she would come , sit on the edge of the bed , they would talk some more , maybe about pleasanter things , and maybe he would kiss her . Her mouth was lovely and full , sensual , made to kiss and be kissed . Once for comfort . Twice out of friendship . And three times pays for all . Yes , he felt with an instinct that had so far been quite reliable that it could be done . But he did n't say any of the things that could have started those things happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost surely always would be . Arnie and his lady . If it had n't been so ludicrously ghastly , he could have laughed . " When are they letting you out ? " she asked  | " On an unsuspecting public ? " he asked , and began to giggle . After a moment she joined him in his laughter . " Yes , something like that , " Leigh said , and then snickered again . " Sorry . " s7 " Do n't be , " Dennis said . " People have been laughing at me all my life . I 'm used to it . They say I 'm stuck here until January , but I 'm going to fool them . I 'm going home for Christmas . I 'm working my buns off down in the torture chamber . " " Torture chamber ? " " Physical therapy . My back 's looking good . The other bones are knitting busily  --  the itch is terrible sometimes . I 'm gobbling rosehips by the bushel basket . Dr. Arroway says that 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he checks the bottle every time he comes to visit . " " Does he come often ? The Coach ? " " Yeah , he does . Now he 's got me half-believing that stuff about rosehips making your broken bones knit faster . " Dennis paused . " Of course , I 'm not going to be playing any more football , not ever . I 'm going to be on crutches for a while , and then , with luck , I 'll graduate to a cane . Cheerful old Dr. Arroway tells me I 'm going to limp for maybe a couple of years . Or maybe I 'll always limp . " " I 'm so sorry , " she said in a low voice . " I 'm sorry it had to happen to a nice guy like you , Dennis , but part of it 's selfish . I just wonder if all the rest of this , all this horrible stuff with Arnie , if it would have happenedif you 'd been up and around . " " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " blame it on me . " But she did n't smile . " I 've started to worry about his sanity , did you know that ? That 's the one thing I have n't told my folks or his folks . But I think his mother . . . that she might .. . I do n't know what he said to her that night , after we found the car all smashed up , but .. . I think they must have really put their claws into each other . " Dennis nodded . " But it 's all so . . . so mad ! His parents offered to buy him a good used car to replace Christine , and he said no . Then Mr. Cunningham told me , on the ride home , that he offered to buy Arnie a new car . . . to cash in some bonds he 's held ever since 1955 . Arnie said no , he could n't just take a present like that . And Mr. Cunningham said he could understand that , and it did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , that he 'd even take interest if that was what Arnie wanted . ... Dennis , do you see what I 'm saying ? "  | " Yeah , " Dennis said . " It ca n't be just any car . It 's got to be that car . Christine . " " But to me that seems obsessive . He 's found one object and fixed on it . Is n't that what an obsession is ? I 'm scared , and sometimes I feel hateful . . . but it 's not him I 'm scared of . It 's not him I hate . It 's that frig  --  no , it 's that fucking car . That bitch Christine . " High color bloomed in her cheeks . Her eyes narrowed . The corners of her mouth turned down . Her face was suddenly no longer beautiful , not even pretty ; the light on it was pitiless , changing it into something that was ugly but all the same striking , compelling . Dennis realized for the first time why they called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what I wish would happen , " Leigh said . " I wish somebodywould take his precious fucking Christine out back some night by mistake , out where they put the junks from Philly Plains . " Her eyes sparkled venomously . " And the next day I wish that crane with the big round magnet would come and pick it up and put it in the crusher and I wish someone would push the button and what would come out would be a little cube of metal about three by three by three . Then this would be over , would n't it ? " Dennis did n't answer , and after a moment he could almost see the monster turn around and wrap its scaly tail around itself and steal out of her face . Her shoulders sagged . " Guess that sounds pretty horrible , does n't it ? Like saying I wish those hoods had finished the job . " " I understand how you feel . " " Do you ? " she challenged . Dennis thought of Arnie 's look as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maniacal light that came into his eyes when he was around her . He thought of sitting behind the wheel in LeBay 's garage , and the kind of vision that had come over him . Last of all , he thought of his dream : headlights bearing down on him in the high womanscream of burning rubber . " Yes , " he said . " I think I do . " They looked at each other in the hospital room.  |p213Two-three  hours passed us by , Altitude dropped to 505 , Fuel consumption way too thin , Let 's get home before we run out of gas . Now you ca n't catch meNo , baby , you ca n't catch me'Cause if you get too close , I 'm gone like a c0000l breeze.  --  Chuck BerryAt the hospital they served Thanksgiving dinner in shifts from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon . Dennis got his at quarter past twelve : three careful slices of white turkey breast , one careful ladleful of brown gravy , a scoop of instant mashed potatoes the exact size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches , he thought with sour amusement ) , a like scoop of frozen squash that was an arrogant fluorescentorange , and a small plastic container of cranberry jelly . For dessert there was ice cream . Resting on the corner of his tray was a small blue card . Wise to the ways of the hospital by now  --  once you have been treated for the first set of bedsores to crop up on your ass , Dennis had discovered , you 're wiser to the ways of the hospital than you ever wanted to be  --  he asked the candy-striper who came to take away his tray what the yellow and red cards got for their Thanksgiving dinner . It turned out that the yellow cards got two pieces of turkey , no gravy , potato , no squash , and Jell-O for dessert . The red cards got one slice of white meat , pureed , and potato . Fed to them , in most cases . Dennis found it all pretty depressing . It was only too easy to imagine his mother bringing a great big crackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his father sharpening his carving knife , his sister , flushed with importance and excitement , a red velvet ribbon in her hair , pouring each of them a glass of good red wine . It was also easy to imagine the good smells , the laughter as they sat down . Easy to imagine . . . but probably a mistake . It was , in fact , the most depressing Thanksgiving of his life . Hep214drifted off into an unaccustomed early afternoon nap ( no Physical Therapy because of the holiday ) and dreamed an unsettling dream in which several candy-stripers walked through the IC ward and slapped turkey decals onto the life-support machinery and IV drips . His mother , father , and sister had come over to visit for an hour in the morning , and for the first time he had sensed in Ellie an anxiousness to be gone . They had been invited over to the Callisons ' for a light Thanksgiving brunch , and Lou Callison , one of the three Callison boys , was fourteen and " cute . " Her racked-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare and tragic form of cancer breeding in his bones . He was n't going to be paralyzed for the rest of his life . There was no movie-of-the-week in him . They had called him from the Callisons ' around twelve-thirty and his father sounded a bit drunk  --  Dennis guessed he was maybe on his secondbloody Mary and was maybe getting some disapproving looks from Mom . Dennis himself had just been finishing up his dietician-approved blue-carded Thanksgiving dinner  --  the only such dinner he had ever been able to finish in fifteen minutes  --  and he did a good job of sounding cheerful , not wanting to spoil their good time . Ellie came on the wire briefly , sounding giggly and rather screamy . Maybe it was talking to Ellie that had tired him out enough to need a nap . He had fallen asleep ( and had his unsettling dream ) around two o'clock . The hospital was unusually quiet today , running on a skeleton staff . The usual babble of TVs and transistor radios from the other rooms was muted . The candy-striper who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enjoyed his " special dinner . " Dennis assured her that he had . After all , it was Thanksgiving for her , too . And so he dreamed , and the dream broke up and became a darker sleep , and when he woke up it was nearly five o'clock and Arnie Cunninghamwas sitting in the hard plastic contour chair where his girl had sat only the day before . Dennis was not at all surprised to see him there ; he simply assumed that it was a new dream . " Hi , Arnie , " he said . " How 's it hanging ? " " Hanging good , " Arnie said , " but you look like you 're still asleep , Dennis . Want some head-noogies ? That 'll wake you up . " There was a brown bag on his lap , and Dennis 's sleepy mind thought : Got his lunch after all . Maybe Repperton did n't squash it as bad as we thought . He tried to sit up in the bed , hurt his back , and used the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The motor whined . " Jesus , it 's really you ! "  | " Were you expecting Ghidrah , the Three-Headed Monster ? " Arnie asked amiably . " I was sleeping . I guess I thought I still was . " Dennis rubbed his forehead hard , as if to get rid of the sleep behind it . " Happy Thanksgiving , Arnie . " " You bet , " Arnie said . " Same to you . Did they feed you turkey with all the trimmings ? " Dennis laughed . " I got something that looked like those play-dinners that came with Ellie 's Happy-Time Cafeteria when she was about seven . Remember ? " Arnie put his cupped hands to his mouth and made ralphing noises . " I remember . What a gross-out . " " I 'm really glad you came , " Dennis said , and for a moment he was perilously close to tears . Maybe he had n't realized just how depressed he had been . He redoubled his determination to be home by Christmas . If he was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your folks did n't come ? " " Sure they did , " Dennis said , " and they 'll be back again tonight  --  Mom and Dad will be , anyway  --  but it 's not the same . You know . " " Yeah . Well , I brought some stuff . Told the lady downstairs I had your bathrobe . " Arnie giggled a little . " What is that ? " Dennis asked , nodding at the bag . It was n't just a lunchbag , he saw ; it was a shopping bag . " Aw , I raided the fridge after we et the bird , " Arnie said . " My mom and dad went around visiting their friends from the University  --  they do that every year on Thanksgiving afternoon . They wo n't even be back until around eight . " As he talked , he took things out of the bag . Dennis watched , amazed . Two pewter candle-holders . Two candles . Arnie slammed the candles into the holders , lit them with a matchbook advertising Darnell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four sandwiches , clumsily wrapped in waxed paper . " The way I recall it , " Arnie said , " you always said that scarfing up a couple of turkey sandwiches around eleven-thirty Thursday night was better than Thanksgiving dinner , anyway . Because the pressure was off . " " Yeah , " Dennis said . " Sandwiches in front of the TV . Carson or some old movie . But , honest to God , Arnie , you did n't have to  --  " " Ah , shit , I have n't even been around to see you in almost three weeks . Good thing for me you were sleeping when I came in or youp216probably would have shot me . " He tapped Dennis 's two sandwiches . " Your favorite , I think . White meat and mayo on Wonder Bread . " Dennis got giggling at that , then laughing , then roaring . Arnie could see it hurt his back , but he could n't stop . Wonder Bread had been one of Arnie and Dennis 's great common secrets as children . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread ; Regina bought Diet-Thin loaves , with an occasional side-trip into the Land of Stone-Ground Rye . Dennis 's mother favored Roman Meal and pumpernickelloaves . Arnie and Dennis ate what was given them  --  but both were secret Wonder Bread freaks , and on more than one occasion they had pooled their money and instead of buying sweets they had gotten a loaf of Wonder and a jar of French 's Mustard . They would then slink out into Arnie 's garage ( or Dennis 's tree-house , sadly demolished in a windstorm almost nine years before ) and gobble mustard sandwiches and read Richie Rich comic books until the whole loaf was gone . Arnie joined him in his laughter , and for Dennis that was the best part of Thanksgiving . Dennis had been between roommates for almost ten days , and so had the semi-private room to himself . Arnie closed the door and produced a six-pack of Busch beer from the brown bag . " Wonders will never cease , " Dennis said , and had to laugh again at the unintentional pun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think they ever will . " He toasted Dennis over the candles with a bottle of beer . " Peach . " " Live forever , " Dennis responded . They drank . After they had finished the thick turkey sandwiches , Arnie produced two plastic Tupperware pie-wedges from his apparently bottomless bag and pried off the lids . Two pieces of home-made apple pie rested within . " No , man , I ca n't , " Dennis said . " I 'll bust . " " Eat , " Arnie commanded . " I really ca n't , " Dennis said , taking the Tupperware container and a fresh plastic fork . He finished the slice of pie in four huge bites and then belched . He upended the remainder of his second beer and belched again . " In Portugal , that 's a compliment to the cook , " he said . His head was buzzing pleasantly from the beer . " Whatever you say , " Arnie responded with a grin . He got up , turned on the overhead fluorescent , and snuffed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the windows ; it looked and soundedp217cold . And for Dennis , some of the warm spirit of friendship and real Thanksgiving seemed to go out with the candles . " I 'm gon na hate you tomorrow , " Dennis said . " I 'll probably have to sit on that john in there for an hour . And it hurts my back . " " You remember the time Elaine got the farts ? " Arnie asked , and they both laughed . " We teased her until your mother gave us holy old hell . " " They did n't smell , but they sure were loud , " Dennis said , smiling . " Like gunshots , " Arnie agreed , and they both laughed a little  --  but it was a sad sort of laughter , if there is such a thing . A lot of water under the bridge . The thought that Ellie 's attack of the farts had happened seven years ago was somehow more unsettling than it was amusing . There was a breath of mortality in the realization that seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conversation lapsed a little , both of them lost in their own thoughts . At last Dennis said , " Leigh came by yesterday . Told me about Christine . I 'm sorry , man . Bummer . " Arnie looked up , and his expression of thoughtful melancholy was lost in a cheerful smile that Dennis did n't really believe . " Yeah , " he said . " It was crude . But I went way overboard about it . " " Anyone would , " Dennis said , aware that he had become suddenly watchful , hating it but unable to help it . The friendship part was over ; it had been here , warming the room and filling it , and now it had simply slipped away like the ephemeral , delicate thing it was . Now they were just dancing . Arnie 's cheerful eyes were also opaque and  --  he would have sworn to it  --  watchful . " Sure . I gave my mother a hard time . Leigh too , I guess . It was just the shock of seeing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes . " He shook his head . " Bad news . " " Are you going to be able to do anything with it ? " Arnie brightened immediately  --  really brightened this time , Dennis felt . " Sure ! I already have . You would n't believe it , Dennis , if you 'd seen the way it looked in that parking lot . They made them tough in those days , not like now when all the stuff that looks like metal is really just shiny plastic . That car is nothing but a damn tank . The glass was the worst part . And the tires , of course . They slashed the tires . " " What about the engine ? " " Never got at it , " Arnie said promptly , and that was the first lie . They had been at it , all right . When Arnie and Leigh had gotten to Christine that afternoon , the distributor cap had been lying on the pavement . Leigh had recognized it and had told Dennis about it . What elsep218had they done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone was going to use a tire iron to punch holes in the bodywork , might they not be apt to use the same tool to spring the radiator in a few places ? What about the plugs ? The voltage regulator ? The carbu-retor ? Arnie , why are you lying to me ? " So what are you doing with it now ? " Dennis asked . " Spending money on it , what else ? " Arnie said , and laughed his almost-genuine laugh . Dennis might even have accepted it as genuine if he had n't heard the real article once or twice over the Thanksgiving supper Arnie had brought . " New tires , new glass . Got some bodywork to do , and then it will be as good as new . " As good as new . But Leigh had said that they had found something that was little more than a smashed hulk , a carny **33;10891;TOOLONG . Why are you lying ? For a cold moment he found himself wondering if maybe Arnie had n't gone a little crazy  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feeling Dennis got from him was one of . . . furtiveness . Craftiness . Then , for the first time , the crazy thought came to him , the thought that maybe Arnie was only half-lying , trying to lay a groundworkof plausibility for . . . for what ? A case of spontaneous regeneration ? That was pretty crazy , was n't it ? Was n't it ? It was indeed , Dennis thought , unless you had happened to see a mass of cracks in a windshield seem to shrink between one viewing and the next . Just a trick of the light . That 's what you thought then , and you were right . But a trick of the light did n't explain the haphazard way Arnie had gone about rebuilding Christine , the hopscotch of old and new parts . It did n't explain that weird feeling Dennis had gotten sitting behind the wheel of Christine in LeBay 's garage , or the sense , after the new tire had been put on en route to Darnell 's , that he was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a hole had been cut out of the old-car picture at the spot where one of the old-car tires had been . And nothing explained Arnie 's lie now . . . or the narrow , thoughtfulway he was watching Dennis to see if his lie was going to be accepted . So he smiled ... a big , easy , relieved grin . " Well , that 's great , " he said . Arnie 's narrow , evaluating expression held for a moment longer ; thenp219he smiled an aw-shucks grin and shrugged . " Luck , " he said . " When I think of the things they could have done  --  sugar in the gas tank , molassesin the cub  --  they were stupid . Lucky for me . " " Repperton and his merry crew ? " Dennis asked quietly . The suspicious look , so dark and unlike Arnie , appeared again and then sank from sight . Arnie looked grim now . Grim and morose . He seemed to speak , then sighed instead . " Yeah , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report it . " " My dad did . " " That 's what Leigh said . " " What else did she tell you ? " Arnie asked sharply . " Nothing , and I did n't ask , " Dennis said , holding his hand out . " Your business , Arnie . Peace . " " Sure . " He laughed a little and then passed a hand over his face . " I 'm still not over it . Fuck . I do n't think I 'm ever going to be over it , Dennis . Coming into that parking lot with Leigh , feeling like I was on top of the world , and seeing  --  " " Wo n't they just do it again if you fix her up again ? " Arnie 's face went dead-cold , set . " They wo n't do it again , " he said . His gray eyes were like March ice , and Dennis found himself suddenly very glad he was n't Buddy Repperton . " What do you mean ? " " I 'll be parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and once more his face broke into that large , cheerful , unnatural grin . " What did you think I meant ? " " Nothing , " Dennis said . The image of ice remained . Now it was a feeling of thin ice , creaking uneasily under his feet . Beneath that , black , cold water . " But I do n't know , Arnie . You seem awful sure that Buddy wants to let this go . " " I 'm hoping he 'll see it as a standoff , " Arnie said quietly . " We got him expelled from school  --  " " He got himself expelled ! " Dennis said hotly . " He pulled a knife  --  hell , it was n't even a knife , it was a goddam pigsticker ! " " I 'm just telling it the way he 'll see it , " Arnie said , then held out his hand and laughed . " Peace . " " Yeah , okay . " " We got him expelled  --  or more accurately , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christine . Evens . The end . " " Yeah , if he sees it that way . " " I think he will , " Arnie said . " The cops questioned him and Moochie Welch and Richie Trelawney . Scared them . And almost got Sandy Galtonto confess , I guess . " Arnie 's lip curled . " Fucking crybaby. "  |p220This  was so unlike Arnie  --  the old Arnie  --  that Dennis sat up in bed without thinking and then winced at the pain in his back and lay down again quickly . " Jesus , man , you sound like you want him to stonewall it ! " " I do n't care what he or any of those shitters do , " Arnie said , and then , in a strangely offhand voice he added , " It does n't matter anymore anyhow . " Dennis said , " Arnie , are you all right ? " And for a moment a look of desperate sadness passed over Arnie 's face  --  more than sadness . He looked harried and haunted . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see these things later ; too much later ) of someone so bewildered and entangled and weary of struggling that he hardly knows anymore what it is he is doing . Then that expression , like that other look of dark suspicion , was gone . " Sure , " he said . " I 'm great . Except that you 're not the only one with a hurt back . You remember when I strained it at Philly Plains ? " Dennis nodded . " Check this out . " He stood up and pulled his shirt out of his pants . Something seemed to dance in his eyes . Something flipping and turning at a black depth . He lifted his shirt . It was n't old-fashioned like LeBay 's ; it was cleaner , too  --  a neat , seemingly unbroken band of Lycra about twelve inches across . But , Dennis thought , a brace was a brace . It was too close to LeBay for comfort . " I put another hurt on it getting Christine back to Will 's , " Arnie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that 's how upset I was . Hooking her up to the wrecker , I guess , but I do n't know for sure . At first it was n't too bad , then it got worse . Dr. Mascia prescribed  --  Dennis , are you okay ? " With what felt like a fantastic effort , Dennis kept his voice even . He moved his features around into an expression which felt at least faintly like pleasant interest . . . and still there was that something dancing in Arnie 's eyes , dancing and dancing . " You 'll shake it off , " Dennis said . " Sure , I imagine , " Arnie said , tucking his shirt back in around the back brace . " I 'm just supposed to watch what I lift so I do n't do it again . " He smiled at Dennis . " If there was still a draft , it would keep me out of the Army , " he said.  |p221Once  again Dennis restrained himself from any movement that could have been interpreted as surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet . At the sight of that back brace , so like LeBay 's , they had brokenout in gooseflesh . Arnie 's eyes  --  like black water under thin gray March ice . Black water and glee dancing far down within them like the twisting , decomposing body of a drowned man . " Listen , " Arnie said briskly . " I got ta move . Hope you did n't think I could hang around a lousy place like this all night . " " That 's you , always in demand , " Dennis said . " Seriously , man , thanks . You cheered up a grim day . " For one strange instant , he thought Arnie was going to weep . That dancing thing down deep in his eyes was gone and his friend was there  --  really there . Then Arnie smiled sincerely . " Just remember one thing , Dennis : nobody misses you . Nobody at all . " " Eat me raw through a Flavor Straw , " Dennis said solemnly . Arnie gave him the finger . The formalities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brown shopping bag , considerably deflated , candle-holders and empty beer bottles clinking inside . Dennis had a sudden inspiration . He rapped his knuckles on his leg cast . " Sign this , Arnie , would you ? " " I already did , did n't I ? " " Yeah , but it wore off . Sign it again ? " Arnie shrugged . " If you 've got a pen . " Dennis gave him one from the drawer of the night-table . Grinning , Arnie bent over the cast , which was hoisted to an angle over the bed with a series of weights and pulleys , found white space in the intaglio of names and mottoes , and scribbled : For Dennis Guilder , The World 's Biggest Dorkp222He patted the cast when he was done and handed the pen back to Dennis . " Okay ? " " Yeah , " Dennis said . " Thanks . Stay loose , Armes ' " You know it . Happy Thanksgiving . " " Same to you . " Arnie left . Later on , Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the day 's hilarity , had gone hone to bed . On their way home , the Guilders commented to each other on how withdrawnDennis had seemed . " He was in a blue study , all right , " Guilder said . " Holidays in the hospital are n't any fun . " As for Dennis himself , he spent a long and thoughtful time that eveningexamining two signatures . Arnie had indeed signed his cast , but at a time when both of Dennis 's legs had been in full-leg casts . That first time , he had signed the cast on the right leg , which had been up in the air when Arnie came in . Tonight he had signed the left . Dennis buzzed for a nurse and used all his charm persuading her to lower his left leg so he could compare the two signatures , side by side . The cast on his right leg had been cut down , and would come off altogetherin a week or ten days . Arnie 's signature had not rubbed off  --  that had been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut off . Arnie had not written a message on the right leg , only his signature . With some effort ( and some pain ) , Dennis and the nurse were able to maneuver his legs close enough together so he could study the two signaturesside by side . In a voice so dry and cracked he was hardly able to recognize it as his own , he asked the nurse , " Do they look the same to you ? " " No , " the nurse said . " I 've heard of forging checks , but never casts . Is it a joke ? " " Sure , " Dennis said , feeling an icy coldness rise from his stomach to his chest . " It 's a joke . " He looked at the signatures and felt that rising coldness steal all through him , lowering his body temperature , making the hairs on the back of his neck stir and stiffen : Arnie CunninghamArnie Cunninghamp223They were nothing alike . Late that Thanksgiving night , a cold wind rose , first gusting , then blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a black sky . The last brown and withered leaves of autumn were ripped from the trees and then harried through the gutters . They made a sound like rolling bones . Winter had come to Libertyville . The night was dark , the sky was blue , and down the alley an ice-wagon flew . Door banged open , Somebody screamed , You oughtta heard just what I seen.  --  Bo DiddleyThe Thursday after Thanksgiving was the last day of November , the night that Jackson Browne played the Pittsburgh Civic Center to a selloutcrowd . Moochie Welch went up with Richie Trelawney and Nickey Billingham but got separated from them even before the show began . He was spare-changing , and whether it was because the impending Browne concert had created some extremely mellow vibes or because he was becoming something of an endearing fixture ( Moochie , a romantic , liked to believe the latter ) , he had had a remarkably good night . He had collected nearly thirty dollars ' worth of " spare change . " It was distributedamong all his pockets ; Moochie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy too , with all the traffic leaving the Civic Center . The concert ended at eleven-forty , and he was back in Libertyville shortly after one-fifteen . His last ride was with a young guy who was headed back to Prestonvineon Route 63 . The guy dropped him at the 376 ramp on JFK Drive . Moochie decided to walk up to Vandenberg 's Happy Gas and see Buddy . Buddy had a car , which meant that Moochie , who lived far out on Kingsfield Pike , would n't have to walk home . It was hard work , hitching rides , once you got out in the boonies  --  and the Kingsfield Pike was Boondocks City . It meant he would n't be home until well pastp224dawn , but in cold weather a sure ride was not to be sneezed at . And Buddy might have a bottle . He had walked a quarter of a mile from the 376 exit ramp in the deep single-number cold , his cleated heels clicking on the deserted sidewalk , his shadow waxing and waning under the eerie orange streetlamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the car parked at the curb up ahead . Exhaust curled out of its twin pipes and hung in the perfectly still air , clouding it , before drifting lazily away in stacked layers . The grille , bright chrome highlighted with pricks of orange light , looked at him like a grinning idiot mouth . Moochie recognized the car . It was a two-tone Plymouth . In the light of the maximum-illumination streetlamps the two tones seemed to be ivory and dried blood . It was Christine . Moochie stopped , and a stupid sort of wonder flooded through him  --  it was not fear , at least not at that moment . It could n't be Christine , that was impossible  --  they had punched a dozen holes in the radiator of Cuntface 's car , they had dumped a nearly full bottle of Texas Driver into the carb , and Buddy had produced a five-pound sack of Domino sugar , which he had funnelled into the gas tank through Moochie 's cupped hands . And all of that was just for starters . Buddy had demonstrateda kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had left Moochie feeling both delighted and uneasy . All in all , that car should not have moved under its own power for six months , if ever . So this could not be Christine . It was some other ' 58 Fury . Except it was Christine . He knew it . Moochie stood there on the deserted early-morning sidewalk , his numb ears poking out from beneath his long hair , his breath palming frostily on the air . The car sat at the curb facing him , engine growling softly . It was impossible to tell who , if anyone , was behind the wheel ; it was parked directly beneath one of the streetlights , and the orange globe burned across the glass of the unmarred windshield like a waterproof jack-o ' - lantern seen deep down in dark water . Moochie began to be afraid . He slicked his tongue over dry lips and looked around . To his left was JFK Drive , six lanes wide and looking like a dry riverbed at this empty hour of the morning . To his right was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its window . He looked back at the car . It just sat there , idling . He opened his mouth to speak and produced no sound . He tried again and got a croak . " Hey . Cunningham . "  |p225The  car sat , seeming to brood . Exhaust curled up . The engine rumbled , idling fat on high-test gas . " That you , Cunningham ? " He took one more step . A cleat scraped on cement . His heart was thudding in his neck . He looked around at the street again ; surely anothercar would come , JFK Drive could n't be totally deserted even at one-twenty-five in the morning , could it ? But there were no cars , only the flat orange glare of the streetlights . Moochie cleared his throat . " You ai n't mad , are you ? " Christine 's duals suddenly came on , pinning him in harsh white light . The Fury ripped toward him , peeling out , the tires screaming black slashes of rubber onto the pavement . It came with such sudden power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunches of a dog preparing to spring  --  a dog or a she-wolf . The onside wheels jumped up on the pavement and it ran at Moochie that way , offside wheels down , onside wheels up over the curb , canted at an angle . The undercarriage scraped and shrieked and shot off a swirling flicker of sparks . Moochie screamed and tried to sidestep . The edge of Christine 's bumper barely flicked his left calf and took a chunk of meat . Warm wetness coursed down his leg and puddled in his shoe . The warmth of his own blood made him realize in a confused way just how cold the night was . He thudded hip-first into the doorway of the photo shop , barely missingthe plate-glass window . A foot to the left and he would have crashed right through , landing in a litter of Nikons and Polaroid OneSteps . He could hear the car 's engine , suddenly revving up . That horrible , unearthly shrieking of the undercarriage on the cement again . Moochie turned around , panting harshly . Christine was reversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw . He saw . There was no one behind the wheel . Panic began to pound in his head . Moochie took to his heels . He ran out into JFK Drive , sprinting for the far side . There was an alley over there between a market and a dry-cleaning place . Too narrow for the car . If he could get in thereChange jingled madly in his pants pockets and in the five or sixpockets of his Army-surplus duffel coat . Quarters , nickels , dimes . A jinglingsilver carillon . He pumped his knees almost to his chin . Hiscleated engineer boots drummed the pavement . His shadow chased him . The car somewhere behind him revved again , fell off , revved again ,  |p226fell  off , and then the motor began to shriek . The tires wailed , and Christineshot at Moochie Welch 's back , crossing the lanes of JFK Drive at right angles . Moochie screamed and could not hear himself scream becausethe car was still peeling rubber , the car was still shrieking like an insanely angry , murderous woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer chasing him . It was leading him and gettinglonger . In the window of the dry-cleaning shop he saw great yellow eyes blossom . It was n't even close . At the very last moment Moochie tried to jig left , but Christine jigged with him as if she had read his final desperate thought . The Plymouth hit him squarely , still accelerating , breaking Moochie Welch 's back and knocking him spang out of his engineer 's boots . He was thrown forty feet into the brick siding of the little market , again narrowly missing a plunge through a plate-glass window . The force of his strike was hard enough to cause him to rebound into the street again , leaving a splash of blood on the brick like an inkblot . A picture of it would appear the next day on the front page of the Libertyville Keystone . Christine reversed , screeched to a skidding , sliding stop , and roared forward again . Moochie lay near the curbing , trying to get up . He could n't get up . Nothing seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white light washed over him . " No , " he whispered through a mouthful of broken teeth . " N  --  " The car roared forward and over him . Change flew everywhere . Moochie was pulled and rolled first one way and then the other as Christine reversed into the street again . She stood there , engine revving and falling off to a rich idle , then revving again . She stood there as if thinking . Then she came at him again . She hit him , jumped the curb , skidded around , and then reversed again , thumping back down . She screamed forward . And back . And forward . Her headlights glared . Her exhaust pipes jetted hot blue smoke . The thing in the street no longer looked like a human being ; it looked like a scattered bundle of rags . The car reversed a final time , skidded around in a half-circle , and accelerated , roaring over the bleeding bundle in the street again and going down the Drive , the blast of its engine , still winding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping buildings  --  but not entirely sleepingnow ; lights were beginning to flick on , people who lived over their stores were going to their windows to see what all the racket had been about , and if there had been an accident . One of Christine 's headlights had been shattered . Another flickered unsteadily off and on , bleared with a thin wash of Moochie 's blood . The grille had been bent inward , and the dents in it approximated the shape and size of Moochie 's torso with all the gruesome perfection of a deathmask . Blood was splashed across the hood in fans that spread out as windspeed increased . The exhaust had taken on a heavy , blatting sound ; one of Christine 's two mufflers had been destroyed . Inside , on the instrument panel , the odometer continued to run backward , as if Christine were somehow slipping back into time , leaving not only the scene of the hit-and-run behind but the actual fact of the hitand-run . The muffler was the first thing . Suddenly that heavy , blatting sound diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood began to run toward the front of the car again in spite of the wind  --  as if a movie film had been reversed . The flickering headlight suddenly shone steadily , and a tenth of a mile later the deadlight became a headlight again . With an unimportant tinkling sound  --  no more than the sound of a small boy 's boot breaking the thin scum of ice on a mudpuddle  --  the glass reassembled itself from nowhere . There was a hollow punk ! punk ! punk ! sound from the front end , the sound of denting metal , the sound you sometimes get when you squeeze a beer-can . But instead of denting , Christine 's grille was popping back out  --  a bodyshop veteran with fifty years ' experience in putting fenderbendersright could not have done it more neatly . Christine turned onto Hampton Street even before the first of those awakened by the screaming of her tires had reached Moochie 's remains . The blood was gone . It had reached the front of the hood and disappeared . The scratches were gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR ENTRY sign , there was one final punk ! as the last dimple  --  this one in the left front bumper , the spot where Christinehad struck Moochie 's calf  --  popped back out . Christine looked like new . The car stopped in front of the large garage door in the middle of the darkened , silent building . There was a small plastic box clipped to the driver 's side sun-visor . This was a little doodad Will Darnell had given Arnie when Arnie began to run cigarettes and booze over into Newp228York State for him  --  it was , perhaps , Darnell 's version of a gold key to the crapper . In the still air the door-opener hummed briefly , and the garage door rattled obediently up . Another circuit was made by the rising door , and a few interior lights came on , burning weakly . The headlight knob on the dashboard suddenly went in , and Christine'sduals went out . She rolled inside and whispered across the oilstainedconcrete to stall twenty . Behind her , the overhead door , which had been set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light circuitwas broken , and the garage was dark again . In Christine 's ignition switch , the keys dangling down suddenly turned to the left . The engine died . The leather patch with the initials R.D.L. branded into it swung back and forth in decreasing arcs .. and was finally still . Christine sat in the dark , and the only sound in Darnell 's Do-ItYourselfGarage was the slow tick of her cooling engine . I got a ' 69 Chevy with a 396 , Feully heads and a Hurst on the floor , She 's waiting tonightDown in the parking-lotOutside the 7-11 store . . .  --  Bruce SpringsteenArnie Cunningham did not go to school the next day . He said he thought he might be coming down with the flu . But that evening he told his parents that he felt enough improved to go down to Darnell 's and do some work on Christine . Regina protested  --  although she did not come right out and say so , she thought Arnie looked like death warmed over . His face was now entirelyfree of acne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too pale , and there were dark circles under his eyes , as if he had n't been sleeping . In addition , he was still limping . She wondered uneasily if her son could be using some sort of drug , if perhaps he had hurt his back worse than he had let on and had started taking pills so he could go onp229working on the goddamned car . Then she dismissed the thought . Obsessed as he might be with the car , Arnie would not be that stupid . " I'm-really fine , Mom , " he said . " You do n't look fine . And you hardly touched your supper . " " I 'll get some chow later on . " " How 's your back ? You 're not lifting a lot of heavy stuff down there , are you ? " " No , Mom . " This was a lie . And his back had hurt terribly all day long . This was the worst it had been since the original injury at Philly Plains ( oh , was that where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you sure ? ) . He had taken the brace off for a while , and his back had throbbed fit to kill him . He had put it on again after only fifteen minutes , cinching it tighter than ever . Now his back really was a little better . And he knew why . He was going to her . That was why . Regina looked at him , worried and at a loss . For the first time in her life she simply did not know how to proceed . Arnie was beyond her control now . Knowing it brought on a horrible feeling of despair that sometimes crept up on her and filled her brain with an awful , empty , rotten coldness . At these times a depression so total she could barely credit it would steal through her , making her wonder exactly what it was she had lived her life for  --  so her son could fall in love with a girl and a car all in the same terrible fall ? Was that it ? So she could see exactlyhow hateful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ? Was that it ? And it really did n't have anything to do with the girl at all , did it ? No . In her mind , it always came back to the car . Her rest had become broken and uneasy , and for the first time since her miscarriagenearly twenty years before , she had found herself considering making an appointment with Dr. Mascia to see if he would give her some pill for the stress and the depression and the attendant insomnia . She thought about Arnie on her long sleepless nights , and about mistakesthat could never be rectified ; she thought about how time had a way of swinging the balance of power on its axis , and how old age had a way of sometimes looking through a dressing-table mirror like the hand of a corpse poking through eroded earth . " Will you be back early ? " she asked , knowing this was the last breastwork of the truly powerless parent , hating it , unable  --  now  --  to change it . " Sure , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Arnie , I wish you 'd stay home . You really do n't look good at all . " " I 'll be fine , " he said . " Got to be . I have to run some auto parts overto Jamesburg for Will tomorrow . "  | " Not if you 're sick , " she said . " That 's nearly a hundred and fifty miles . " " Do n't worry . " He kissed her cheek  --  the passionless kiss-on-thecheekof cocktail-party acquaintances . He was opening the kitchen door to go out when Regina asked , " Didyou know the boy who was run down last night on Kennedy Drive ? " He turned back to look at her , his face expressionless . " What ? " " The paper said he went to Libertyville . " " Oh , the hit-and-run . . . that 's what you 're talking about . " " Yes . " " I had a class with him when I was a freshman , " Arnie said . " I think . No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . " She nodded , pleased . " That 's good . The paper said there were residues of drugs in his system . You 'd never take drugs , would you , Arnie ? " Arnie smiled gently at her pallid , watchful face . " No , Mom , " he said . " And if your back started to hurt you  --  I mean , if it really started to hurt you  --  you 'd go see Dr. Mascia about it , would n't you ? You would n't buy anything from a . . . a drug-pusher , would you ? " " No , Mom , " he repeated , and went out . There had been more snow . Another thaw had melted most of it , but this time it had not disappeared completely ; it had only withdrawn into the shadows , where it formed a white rime under hedges , the bases of trees , the overhang of the garage . But in spite of the snow around the edges  --  or maybe because of it  --  their lawn looked oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father looked like a strange refugeefrom summer as he raked the last of the autumn leaves . Arnie raised his hand briefly to his father and made as if to go past without speaking . Michael called him over . Arnie went reluctantly . He did n't want to be late for his bus . His father had also aged in the storms that had blown up over Christine , although other things had undoubtedly played a part . He had made a bid for the chairmanship of the History Department at Horlicks late in the summer and had been rebuffed quite soundly . And during his annualOctober checkup , the doctor had pointed out an incipient phlebitis problem  --  phlebitis , which had nearly killed Nixon ; phlebitis , an old folks ' problem . As that late fall moved toward another gray **25;10926;TOOLONG , Michael Cunningham looked gloomier than ever . " Hi , Dad . Listen , I 've got to hurry if I 'm going to catch  --  " Michael looked up from the little pile of frozen brown leaves he hadp231managed to get together ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them bleed . Arnie stepped back involuntarily , a little shocked . His father 's face was haggard . " Arnold , " he said , " where were you last night ? " " What  --  ? " Arnie gaped , then closed his mouth slowly . " Why , here . Here , Dad . You know that . " " All night ? " " Of course . I went to bed at ten o'clock . I was bushed . Why ? " " Because I had a call from the police today , " Michael said . " About that boy who was run over on JFK Drive last night . " " Moochie Welch , " Arnie said . He looked at his father with calm eyes that were deeply circled and socketed for all their calmness . If the son had been shocked by the father 's appearance , the father was also dully shocked by his son 's  --  to Michael , the boy 's eyesockets looked nearly like a skull 's vacant orbs in the failing light . " The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in touch . I suppose . Mom does n't know  --  that he might have been one of the guys that trashed Christine ? " " Not from me . " " I did n't tell her either . I 'd be glad if she did n't find that out , " Arnie said . " She may find it out eventually , " Michael said . " In fact , she almost certainly will . She 's an extremely intelligent woman , in case you 've never noticed . But she wo n't find it out from me . " Arnie nodded , then smiled humorlessly . " Where were you last night ? ' Your trust is touching , Dad . " Michael flushed , but his eyes did n't drop . " Maybe if you 'd been standing outside yourself these last couple of months , " he said , " you 'd understand why I asked . " " What the hell does that mean ? " " You know damn well . It hardly even bears discussing anymore . We just go around and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jittering apart and you stand there and ask me what I 'm talking about . " Arnie laughed . It was a hard , contemptuous sound . Michael seemed to shrivel a little before it . " Mom asked me if I was on drugs . Maybe you want to check that one out , too . " Arnie made as if to push up the sleeves of his warmup jacket . " Want to check for needle-tracks ? " " I do n't need to ask if you 're on drugs , " Michael said . " You 're only on one I know of , and that 's enough . It 's that goddam car . " Arnie turned as if to go , and Michael pulled him back.  | " Get your hand off my arm . " Michael dropped his hand . " I wanted you to be aware , " he said . " I no more think you 'd kill someone than I think you could walk across the Symonds ' swimming pool . But the police are going to question you , Arnie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . To them , surprise can look like guilt . " " All of this because some drunk ran over that shitter Welch ? " " It was n't like that , " Michael said . " I got that much out of this fellow Junkins who called me up on the phone . Whoever killed the Welch boy ran him down and then backed over him and ran over him again and backed up again and  --  " " Stop it , " Arnie said . He suddenly looked sick and frightened , and Michael had much the same feeling Dennis had had on Thanksgiving evening : that in this tired unhappiness the real Arnie was suddenly close to the surface , perhaps reachable . " It was . .. incredibly brutal , " Michael said . " That 's what Junkins said . You see , it does n't look like an accident at all . It looks like murder . " " Murder , " Arnie said , dazed . " No , I never  --  " " What ? " Michael asked sharply . He grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Arnie looked at his father . His face was masklike again . " I never thought it could be that , " he said . " That 's all I was going to say . " " I just wanted you to know , " he said . " They 'll be looking for someonewith a motive , no matter how thin . They know what happened to your car , and that the Welch boy might have been involved , or that you might think he was involved . Junkins may be around to talk to you . " " I do n't have anything to hide . " " No , of course not , " Michael said . " You 'll miss your bus . " " Yeah , " Arnie said . " Got ta go . " But he stayed a moment longer , looking at his father . Michael suddenly found himself thinking of Arnie 's ninth birthday . He and his son had gone to the little zoo in Philly Plains , had eaten lunch out , and had finished the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer Basin Drive . That place had burned down in 1975 . Regina had not been able to come ; she had been flat on her back with bronchitis . The two of them had had a fine time . For Michael , that had been his son 's best birthday , the one that symbolized for him above all others his son 's sweet and uneventful American boyhood . They had gone to the zoo and come back and nothing much hadp233happened except that they had had a great time  --  Michael and his son , who had been and who still was so dear to him . He wet his lips and said , " Sell her , Arnie , why do n't you ? When she 's completely restored , sell her away . You could get a lot of money . A couple-three thousand , maybe . " Again that frightened , tired look seemed to sweep over Arnie 's face , but Michael could n't tell for sure . The sunset had faded to a bitter orangeline on the western horizon , and the little yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there at all  --  went away . " No , I could n't do that , Dad , " Arnie said gently , as if speaking to a child . " I could n't do that now . I 've put too much into her . Way too much . " And then he was gone , cutting across the yard to the sidewalk , joining the other shadows , and there was only the sound of his footfalls coming back , soon lost . Put too much into her ? Have you ? Exactly what , Arnie ? What have you put into her ? Michael looked down at the leaves , then around at his yard . Beneath the hedge and under the overhang of the garage , cold snow glimmered in the coming dark , livid and stubbornly waiting for reinforcements . Waiting for winter . She 's real fine , my 409 , My four-speed , dual-quad , Positraction 409.  --  The Beach BoysRegina was tired  --  she tired more easily these days , it seemed  --  and they went to bed together around nine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dutiful and joyless ( lately they made love a lot , it was almost always dutiful and joyless , and Michael had begun having the unpleasant feeling that his wife was using his penis as a sleeping pill ) , and as they lay in their twin beds after , Michael asked casually : " How did you sleep last night ? " " Quite well , " Regina said candidly , and Michael knew she was lying . Good.  | " I came up around eleven and Arnie seemed restless , " Michael said , still keeping his voice casual . He was deeply uneasy now  --  there had been something in Arnie 's face tonight , something he had n't been able to read because of the damned shadows . It was probably nothing , nothingat all , but it glowed in his mind like a baleful neon sign that simply would not shut off . Had his son looked guilty and scared ? Or had it just been the light ? Unless he could resolve that , sleep would be a long time coming tonight  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up around one , " Regina said , and then hurried to add , " Just to use the bathroom . I checked in on him . " She laughed a little wistfully . " Old habits die hard , do n't they ? " " Yes , " Michael said . " I guess they do . " " He was sleeping deeply then . I wish I could get him to wear pajamasin cold weather . " " He was in his skivvies ? " " Yes . " He settled back , immeasurably relieved and more than a little ashamed of himself as well . But it was better to know . . . for sure . It was all very well for him to tell Arnie that he knew the boy could no more commit a murder than he could walk on water . But the mind , that perverse monkey  --  the mind can conceive of anything and seems to take a perverse delight in doing so . Just maybe , Michael thought , lacing his hands behind his head and looking up at the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living . In the mind a wife can rut , laughing , with a best friend , a best friend can cast plots against you and plan backstabbings , a son can commit murder by auto . Better to be ashamed and put the monkey to sleep . Arnie had been here at one o'clock . It was unlikely Regina was mistaken about the time because of the digital clock-radio on their bureau  --  it told the time in numbers that were big and blue and unmistakable . His son had been here at one o'clock , and the Welch boy had been run down three miles away twenty-five minutes later . Impossible to believe that Arnie could have dressed , gone out ( without Regina , who had surely been lying wakeful , hearing him ) , gone down to Darnell 's , gotten Christine , and driven out to where Moochie Welch had been killed . Physically impossible . Not that he had ever believed it to begin with . The mind-monkey was satisfied . Michael rolled over on his right side , slept , and dreamed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless series of small Astro-Turfed greens where windmills turned and tiny water-hazards lay in wait .. and hep235dreamed that they were alone , all alone in the world , because his son 's mother had died in childbirth  --  very sad ; people still remarked on how inconsolable Michael had been  --  but when they went home , he and his son , the house would be theirs alone , they would eat spaghetti right from the pot like a couple of bachelor slobs , and when the dishes were washed they would sit at a kitchen table hidden beneath spread newspapers and build model cars with harmless plastic engines . In his sleep , Michael Cunningham smiled . Beside him , in the other bed , Regina did not . She lay awake and waited for the sound of the door that would tell her that her son had come in from the world outside . When she heard the door open and close ... when she heard his step on the stairs . . . then she would be able to sleep . Maybe . I think you better slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what ? Hush up and mind my own bidness ? But Baby , you are my bidness ! You g0000d bidness , baby , And I love good bidness ! What kind of car am I drivin ? I 'm drive a ' 48 CadillacWith Thunderbird wings , I tell you , baby , she 's a movin thing , Ride on , Josephine , ride on .. .  --  Elias McDanielJunkins turned up at Darnell 's around eight-forty-five that evening . Arnie had just finished with Christine for the night . He had replaced the radio antenna that Repperton 's gang had snapped off with a new one , and for the last fifteen minutes or so he had been sitting behind the wheel , listening to WDIL 's Friday Night Cavalcade of Gold . He had meant to do no more than turn the radio on and dial acrossp236once , making sure that he had hooked up the antenna plug properly and that there was no static . But he had run onto WDIL 's strong signal and had sat there , looking straight through the windshield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller sang " I Fought the Law , " as Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers sang " Why Do Fools Fall in Love ? , " as Eddie Cochran sang " C'm on , Everybody , " and Buddy Holly sang " Rave On . " There were no commercials on WDIL Friday nights , and no deejays . Just the sounds . Gone from the charts but not from our hearts . Every now and then a soothing female voice would break in and tell him what he already knew  --  that he was listening to WDIL-Pittsburgh , the sound of Blue Suede Radio . Arnie sat dreaming behind the wheel , the red idiot lights glowing on the dash , tapping his fingers lightly . The antenna was fine . Yes . He had done a good job . It was like Will said ; he had a light touch . Look at Christine ; Christine proved it . She had been a hunk of junk sitting on LeBay 's lawn and he had brought her back ; then she had been a hunk of junk sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back again . He had .. . Rave on . . . rave on and tell me . . Tell me . . . not to be lonely . . . He had what ? Replaced the antenna , yes . And he had popped some of the dents , he could remember that . But he had n't ordered any glass ( although it was all replaced ) , he had n't ordered any new seat covers ( but they were all replaced , too ) , and he had only looked closely under the hood once beforeslamming it back down in horror at the damage they had done to Christine 's mill . But now the radiator was whole , the engine block clean and glowing , the pistons moving free and clear . And it purred like a cat . But there had been dreams . He had dreamed of LeBay behind the wheel of Christine , LeBay dressed in an Army uniform that was spotted and splotched with blue-. gray patches of graveyard mould . LeBay 's flesh had sloughed and run . White , gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once been were empty and dark ( but something was squirming in there , ah , yes , something ) . And then Christine 's headlights had come on and someone had been pinned there , pinned like a bug on a white square of cardboard . Someone familiar . Moochie Welch ?  |p237Maybe  . But as Christine suddenly rocketed forward , tires screaming , it had seemed to Arnie that the terrified face out there on the street ran like tallow , changing even as the Plymouth bore down on it : now it was Repperton 's face , now Sandy Gallon 's , now it was Will Darnell 's heavy moon face . Whoever was out there had jumped aside , but LeBay had thrown Christine into reverse , working the shift lever with black rotting fingers  --  a wedding ring hung on one , as loose as a hoop thrown over the branch of a dead tree  --  and then he threw it back into drive as the figure raced for the far side of the street . And as Christine bore down again , the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnie had seen the face of his mother . . . the face of Dennis Guilder . . Leigh 's face , all eyes under a floating cloud of dark-blond hair . . . and finally his own face , the twisted mouth forming the words No ! No ! No ! Overriding everything , even the heavy thunder of the exhaust ( somethingunderneath had been damaged for sure ) , was LeBay 's rotting , triumphantvoice , coming from a decayed larynx , passing lips that were already shrivelled away from the teeth and tattooed with a delicate spidering of dark green mould , LeBay 's triumphant , shrieking voice : Here you go , you shitter ! See how you like it ! There had been the heavy , mortal thud of Christine 's bumper striking flesh , the gleam of a pair of spectacles rising in the night air , turning over and over , and then Arnie had awakened in his room , curled into a trembling ball and clutching his pillow . It had been quarter of two in the morning , and his first feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still alive . He was alive , LeBay was dead , and Christine was safe . The only three things in the world that mattered . Oh but Arnie , how did you hurt your back ? Some voice inside , sly and insinuating  --  asking a question he was afraid to answer . I hurt it at Philly Plains , he had told everyone . One of the junkers started to slip back down the ramp of Will 's flatbed and I pushed it back up  --  did n't think about it ; I just did it . Strained something really bad . So he had said . And one of the junkers had started to slip , and he had pushed it back up , but that had n't been how he hurt his back , had it ? No . That night after he and Leigh had found Christine smashed to hell in the parking lot , sitting on four slashed tires . . . that night at Darnell 's , after everyone was gone . . . he had tuned the radio in Will 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted him now , why not ? He was runningcigarettes across the state line into New York , he was running fire/works all the way over to Burlington , and twice he had run something wrapped in flat brown-paper packages into Wheeling , where a young guy in an old Dodge Challenger traded him another , slightly larger , brown-paper package for it . Arnie thought maybe he was trading cocainefor money , but he did n't want to know for sure . He drove a boat on these trips , Will 's private car , a 1966 Imperial as black as midnight in Persia . It was whisper-quiet , and the trunk had a false bottom . If you kept to the speed limit , it was no problem . Why should it be ? The important thing was that he now had the keys to the garage . He could come in after everyone else was gone . Like he had that night . And he had turned on WDIL . and he had .. he had . . . Hurt his back somehow . What had he been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in answer , floating up from his subconscious : It 's just a funny little glitch . Did he really want to know ? He did n't . In fact , there were times when he did n't want the car at all . There were times when he felt he would be better off just . . . well , junking it . Not that he ever would , or could . It was just that , sometimes ( in the sweaty , shaking aftermath of that dream last night , for instance ) , he felt that if he got rid of it , he would be . . . happier . The radio suddenly spat an almost feline burst of static . " Do n't worry , " Arnie whispered . He ran his hand slowly over the dashboard , loving the feel of it . Yes , the car frightened him sometimes . And he supposed his father was right ; it had changed his life to some degree . But he could no more junk it than he could commit suicide . The static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And then a voice said in his ear , " Arnold Cunningham ? " He jumped and snapped off the radio . He turned around . A small , dapper little man was leaning in Christine 's window . His eyes were a dark brown , and his color was high  --  from the cold outside , Arnie guessed . " Yes ? " " Rudolph Junkins . State Police , Detective Division . " Junkins stuck his hand in through the open window . Arnie looked at it for a moment . So his father had been right . He grinned his most charming grin , took the hand , shook it firmly , and said , " Do n't shoot , copper , I 'll throw out my guns . " Jenkins returned Arnie 's grin , but Arnie noticed that the grin did nop239more than touch his eyes , which were exploring the car in a quick , thoroughfashion that Arnie did n't like . Not at all . " Whoo ! I got the feeling from the local police that the guys who worked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't look like it . " Arnie shrugged and got out of the car . Friday nights were slow at the garage ; Will himself rarely came in , and he was n't in tonight . Across the way , in stall ten , a fellow named Gabbs was putting a new muffler on his old Valiant , and down at the far end of the garage there was the periodicburr of an air wrench as some fellow put on his snow tires . Otherwise , he and Junkins had the place to themselves . " It was n't anywhere near as bad as it looked , " Arnie said . He thought that this smiling , dapper little man might be extremely clever . As if it was a natural outgrowth of the thought , he rested his hand easilyon Christine 's roof and immediately felt better . He could cope with this man , clever or not . After all , what was there to worry about ? " There was no structural damage . " " Oh ? I understood they punched holes in the body with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Christine 's flank . " I 'll be damned if I can see the fill . You must be a bodywork genius , Arnie . The way my wife drives , maybe I ought to put you on retainer . " He smiled disarmingly , but his eyes went on running back and forth over the car . They would dart momentarily to Arnie 's face and then go back to the car again . Arnie liked it less and less . " I 'm good but not God , " Arnie said . " You can see the bodywork if you really look for it . " He pointed at a minute ripple in Christine 's back deck . " And there . " He pointed at another . " I was lucky enough to find some original Plymouth body parts up in Ruggles . I replaced the entire back door on this side . You see the way the paint does n't quite match ? " He knocked his knuckles on the door . " Nope , " Junkins said . " I might be able to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect match to me . " He also knocked his knuckles on the door . Arnie frowned . " Hell of a job , " Junkins said . He walked slowly around to the front of the car . " Hell of a job , Arnie . You 're to be congratulated . " " Thanks . " He watched as Junkins , in the guise of the sincere admirer , used his sharp brown eyes to look for suspicious dents , flaked paint , maybe a spot of blood or a snarl of matted hair . Looking for signs of Moochie Welch . Arnie was suddenly sure that was just what the shitter was doing . " What exactly can I do for you , Detective Junkins ? "  |p240Junkins  laughed . " Man , that 's formal ! I ca n't take that ! Make it Rudy , okay ? " " Sure , " Arnie said , smiling . " What can I do for you , Rudy ? " " You know , it 's funny , " Junkins said , squatting to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflectively with his knuckles and then , with seeming absent-mindedness , he ran his forefinger along the headlight 's semicircular metal hood . His overcoat pooled on the oil-stained cement floor for a moment ; then he stood up . " We get reports on anything of this nature  --  the trashing of your car , I mean  --  " " Oh , hey , they did n't really trash it , " Arnie said . He was beginning to feel as if he was on a tightrope , and he touched Christine again . Her solidity , her reality , once more seemed to comfort him . " They tried , you know , but they did n't do a very good job . " " Okay . I guess I 'm not up on the current terminology . " Junkins laughed . " Anyway , when it came to my attention , what do you think I said ? Where 's the photographs ? ' That 's what I said . I thought it was an oversight , you know . So I called the Libertyville P.D . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Arnie said . " A kid my age ca n't get anything but liability insurance , you know that . Even the liability comes with a **29;10953;TOOLONG . If I had damage insurance , I would have taken plenty of pictures . But since I did n't , why would I ? I sure would n't want them for my scrapbook . " " No , I guess not , " Junkins said , and walked idly around to the rear of the car , eyes searching for broken glass , for scrapes , for guilt . " But you know what else I thought was funny ? You did n't even report the crime ! " He raised his dark questioning eyes to Arnie 's , looked at him closely  --  and then smiled a phony , bewildered little smile . " Did n't even report it ! Huh , ' I said . Sonofabitch ! Who reported it ? ' Guy 's father , they tell me . " Junkins shook his head . " I do n't get that , Arnie , I do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old car until it 's worth two , maybe five thousand dollars , then some guys come along and beat the hell out of it  --  " " I told you  --  " Rudy Junkins raised his hand and smiled disarmingly . For one weird second Arnie thought he was going to say " Peace , " as Dennis sometimesdid when things got heavy . " Damaged it . Sorry . " " Sure , " Arnie said . " Anyhow , according to what your girlfriend said , one of the perpe/trators . . . well , defecated on the dashboard . I would have thought you would have been mad as hell . I would have thought you would have reported it . " Now the smile faded altogether and Junkins looked at Arnie soberly , even sternly . Arnie 's cool gray eyes met Junkins 's brown ones . " Shit wipes off , " he said finally . " You want to know something , Mr.  --  Rudy ? You want me to tell you something ? " " Sure , son . " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fork and marked up an antique bureau that my mother had saved up for over a period of maybe five years . Saved up her pin money , that 's what she said . I guess I racked the hell out of it in a very short time . Of course I do n't remember it , but she says she just sat right down and bawled . " Arnie smiled a little . " Up until this year , I could n't feature my mother doing that . Now I think I can . Maybe I 'm growing up a little , what do you think ? " Junkins lit a cigarette . " Am I missing the point , Arnie ? Because I do n't see it yet . " " She said that she would rather have had me in diapers until I was three than have had me do that . Because , she said , shit wipes off . " Arnie smiled . " You flush it away and it 's gone . " " The way Moochie Welch is gone ? " Junkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ? " " No . " " Scout 's honor ? " Junkins asked . The question was humorous but the eyes were not ; they probed at Arnie , looking for the smallest break , a crucial flicker . Down the aisle , the fellow who had been putting on his winter snows dropped a tool on the concrete . It clanged musically and the fellow chanted , almost chorally , " Oh shit on you , you whore . " Junkins and Arnie both glanced that way briefly , and the moment was broken . " Sure , Scout 's honor , " Arnie said . " Look , I suppose you have to do this , it 's your job  --  " " Sure it 's my job , " Junkins agreed softly . " The boy was run over three times each way . He was meat . They scraped him up with a shovel . " " Come on , " Arnie said sickly . His stomach did a lazy barrel roll . " Why ? Is n't that what you 're supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " I had nothing to do with it ! " Arnie cried , and the man across the way , who had been tinkering with his muffler , looked up , startled . Arnie lowered his voice . " I 'm sorry . I just wish you 'd leave me alone . You know damn well I did n't have anything to do with it . You just went over the whole car . If Christine had hit that Welch kid that many times and that hard , it would be all busted up . I know that much just from watching TV . And when I was taking Auto Shop I two years ago , Mr. SmoInack said that the two best ways he knew to totally destroy a car 's front end was to eitherhit a deer or a person . He was joking a little , but he was n't kidding . . if you know what I mean . " Arnie swallowed and heard a click in his throat , which was very dry . " Sure , " Junkins said . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . You look like a sleepwalker . You look absolutely fucked over . Pardon my French . " He flicked his cigarette away . " You know something , Arnie ? " " What ? " " I think you 're lying faster than a horse can trot . " He slapped Christine'shood . " Or maybe I should say faster than a Plymouth can run . " Arnie looked at him , his hand on the outside mirror on the passengerside . He said nothing . " I do n't think you 're lying about killing the Welch boy . But I think you 're lying about what they did to your car ; your girl said they mashed the crap out of it , and she 's a hell of a lot more convincing than you are . She cried while she told me . She said there was broken glass everywhere . . . . Where did you buy replacement glass , by the way ? " " McConnell 's , " Arnie said promptly . " In the Burg . " " Still got the receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll remember you . Big order like that . " " They might , " Arnie said , " but I would n't count on it , Rudy . They 're the biggest auto-glass specialists west of New York and east of Chicago . That covers a lot of ground . They do yea business , and a lot of it 's old cars . " " Still , they 'll have the paperwork . " " I paid cash . " " But your name will be on the invoice . " " No , " Arnie said , and smiled a wintry smile . " Darnell 's Do-It-YourselfGarage . That way I got a ten percent discount . " " You got it all covered , do n't you ? " " Lieutenant Junkins  --  "  | " You 're lying about the glass too , although I 'll be goddamned if I know why . " " You 'd think Christ was lying on Calvary , that 's what I think , " Arnie said angrily . " Since when is it a crime to buy replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or get a discount ? " " Since never , " Junkins said . " Then leave me be . " " More important , I think you 're lying about not knowing anything about what happened to the Welch boy . You know something . I want to know what . " " I do n't know anything , " Arnie said . " What about  --  " " I do n't have anything more to say to you , " Arnie said . " I 'm sorry . " " All right , " Jenkins said , giving up so quickly that Arnie was immediatelysuspicious . He rummaged around in the sportcoat he was wearingunder his topcoat and took out his wallet . Arnie saw that Junkins was carrying a gun in a shoulder holster and suspected Junkins had wanted him to see it . He produced a card and gave it to Arnie . " I can be reached at either of those numbers . If you want to talk about anything . Anything at all . " Arnie put the card in his breast pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell of a restoration job , " he repeated . He looked squarely at Arnie . " Why did n't you report it ? " Arnie let out a low shuddering sigh . " Because I thought that would be the end , " he said . " I thought they 'd let off . " " Yeah , " Junkins said . " I thought that might be it . Good night , son . " " Good night . " Junkins started away , turned , came back . " Think it over , " he said . " You really do look like hell , you know what I mean ? You have a nice girl there . She 's worried about you , and she feels bad about what happened to your car . Your dad 's worried about you , too . I could get that even over the phone . Think it over and then give me a call , son . You 'll sleep better . " Arnie felt something trembling behind his lips , something small and tearful , something that hurt . Junkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  God alone knew what might have spilled out  --  and then a monstrous jab of pain walloped him in the back , making him straighten suddenly . It also had the effect of a slap on a hysteric . He felt calmer , clear-headed again . " Good night , " he repeated . " Good night , Rudy . "  |p244Junkins  looked at him a moment longer , troubled , and then left . Arnie began to shake all over . The trembling started in his hands and spread up his forearms to his elbows , and then it was suddenly everywhere . He grabbed blindly for the doorhandle , found it at last , and slipped into Christine , into the comforting smells of car and fresh upholstery . He turned the key to ACC , the idiot lights glowed , and he felt for the radio dial . As he did so his eyes fell on the swinging leather tab with R.D.L. branded into it and his dream recurred with sudden terrible force : the rotting corpse sitting where he was sitting now ; the empty eyesockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel ; the empty grin of the skull 's teeth as Christine bore down on Moochie Welch while the radio , tuned to WDIL , played " Last Kiss " by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers . He suddenly felt sick  --  puking-sick . Nausea fluttered sickeningly in his stomach and in the back of his throat . Arnie scrambled out of the car and ran for the head , his footfalls hammering crazily in his ears . He just made it . Everything came up ; he vomited again and again until there was nothing left but sour spit . Lights danced in front of his eyes . His ears rang and the muscles in his gut throbbed tiredly . He looked at his pale , harried face in the spotty mirror , at the dark circles under his eyes and the lank spill of hair across his forehead . Junkins was right . He looked like hell . But his pimples were all gone . He laughed crazily . He would n't give Christine up , no matter what . That was the one thing he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only there was nothing left to come up : only ripping , clenching dry-heaves and that electric taste of spit in his mouth again . He had to talk to Leigh . Quite suddenly he had to talk to Leigh . He let himself into Will 's office , where the only sound was the thump of the time clock bolted on the wall turning up fresh minutes . He dialled the Cabots ' number from memory but miscued twice because his fingers were trembling so badly . Leigh herself answered , her voice sounding sleepy . " Arnie ? " " I have to talk to you , Leigh . I have to see you . " " Arnie , it 's almost ten o'clock . I just got out of the shower and into bed . . I was almost asleep . . . " " Please , " he said , and shut his eyes.  | " Tomorrow , " she said . " It ca n't be tonight , my folks would n't let me out so late  --  " " It 's only ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want me to see so much of you , Arnie . They liked you at first , and my dad still does . . . but they both think you 've gottena little spooky . " There was a long , long pause at Leigh 's end . " I think you have , too , " she said finally . " Does that mean you do n't want to see me anymore ? " he asked dully . His stomach hurt , his back hurt , everything hurt . " No . " Now the faintest reproach crept into her voice . " I was kind of getting the idea that you did n't want to see me . . . not at school , and nights you 're always down there at the garage . Working on your car . " " That 's all done , " he said . And then , with a monstrous effort : " It 's the car I want to  --  oww , goddammit ! " He grabbed at his back , where there had been another huge bolt of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arnie ? " She was alarmed . " Are you all right ? " " Yeah . I had a twinge in my back . " " What were you going to say ? " " Tomorrow , " he said . " We 'll drive over to Baskin-Robbins and have an ice cream and maybe do some Christmas shopping and have some supper and I 'll have you home by seven . And I wo n't be weird . I promise . " She laughed a little , and Arnie felt a great , sweeping relief . It was like balm . " You dummy . " " Does that mean okay ? " " Yes , it means okay . " Leigh paused and then said softly , " I said my parents did n't want me to see so much of you . I did n't say I wanted that . " " Thanks , " he said , struggling to keep his voice steady . " Thanks for that . " " What do you want to talk to me about ? " Christine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dreams . And about why I look like hell . And why I always want to listen to WDIL now , and about what I did that night after everyone was gone .. . the night I hurt my back . Oh Leigh I wantAnother slash of pain up his back like cat 's claws . " I think we just talked about it , " he said . " Oh . " A slight , warm pause . " Good . " " Leigh ? " " Umm . " " There 'll be more time now . I promise . All the time you want . " Andp246thought : Because now , with Dennis in the hospital , you 're all that 's left , all that 's left between me ... me and .. . " That 's good , " Leigh said . " I love you . " " Goodbye , Arnie . " Say it back ! he wanted to shout suddenly . Say it back , I need you to say it back ! But there was only the click of the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time , head lowered , getting hold of himself . She did n't need to say it back every time he said it to her , did she ? He did n't need reassurance that badly , did he ? Did he ? Arnie got up and went to the door . She was coming out with him tomorrow , that was the important thing . They would do the Christmas shopping they had been planning on the day those shitters trashed Christine ; they would walk and talk ; they would have a good time . She would say she loved him . " She 'll say it , " he whispered , standing in the doorway , but halfway down the left-hand side of the garage Christine sat like a mute and stupiddenial , her grille poking forward as if hunting something . And the voice whispered out of his lower consciousness , the dark questioning voice : How did you hurt your back ? How did you hurt your back ? How did you hurt your back , Arnie ? It was a question he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My baby drove up in a brand-new Cadillac , She said , " Hey , come here , Daddy , I ai n't never comin back ! " Baby , baby , wo n't you hear my plea ? Come on , sugar , come on back to me ! She said , " Balls to you , big daddy , I ai n't never comin back ! "  --  The ClashIt was a gray day , threatening snow , but Arnie was right on both counts  --  they had a good time and he was n't weird . Mrs. Cabot had beenp247at home when Arnie got there , and her initial reception was cool . But it was a long time  --  perhaps twenty minutes  --  before Leigh came downstairs , wearing a caramel-colored sweater that clung lovingly to her breasts and a new pair of cranberry-colored slacks that clung lovingly to her hips . This inexplicable lateness in a girl who was almost always perfectly on time might have been on purpose . Arnie asked her later and Leigh denied it with an innocence that was perhaps just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purpose . Arnie could be charming when he had to be , and he went to work on Mrs. Cabot with a will . Before Leigh finally came bouncing downstairs , twisting her hair into a ponytail , Mrs. Cabot had thawed . She had gottenArnie a Pepsi-Cola and was listening raptly as he regaled her with tales of the chess club . " It 's the only civilized extra-curricular activity I 've ever heard of , " she told Leigh , and smiled approvingly at Arnie . " BORRRRR-ing , " Leigh trumpeted . She put an arm around Arnie 's waist and smacked him loudly on the cheek . " Leigh Cabot ! " " Sorry , Mums , but he looks cute in lipstick , does n't he ? Wait a minute , Arnie , I 've got a Kleenex . Do n't claw at it . " She dug in her purse for a tissue . Arnie looked at Mrs. Cabot and rolled his eyes . Natalie Cabot put a hand to her mouth and giggled . The rapprochement between her and Arnie was complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardness , left over from the phone conversation of the night before , finally melted away . Arnie had had a vague fear that Christine would not run well , or that Leigh would find something nasty to say about her ; she had never liked riding in his car . Both were needless worries . Christineran like a fine Swiss watch , and the only things Leigh had to say about her rang of pleasure and amazement . " I never would have believed it , " she said as they drove out of the ice-cream parlor 's small parking lot and joined the flow of traffic headed toward the Monroeville Mall . " You must have worked like a dog . " " It was n't as bad as it probably looked to you , " Arnie said . " Mind some music ? " " No , of course not . " Arnie turned on the radio  --  The Silhouettes were kip-kipping and boom-booming through " Get a Job . " Leigh made a face . " DIL , yuck . Can I change it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh rock station and got Billy Joel.  | " You may be right , " Billy admitted cheerfully , " I may be crazy . " This was followed by Billy telling his girl Virginia that Catholic girls started much too late  --  it was the Block Party Weekend . Now , Arnie thought . Now she 'll start to hitch . . back of ... something . But Christine only went rolling along . The mall was thronged with hectic but mostly goodnatured shoppers ; the last frantic and sometimes ugly Christmas rush was better than two weeks off . The Yuletide spirit was still new enough to be novel , and it was possible to look at the tinsel strung through the wide mall hallways without feeling sour and Ebenezer Scroogey . The steady ringing of the Salvation Army Santas ' bells had not yet become a guilty annoyance ; they still chanted good tidings and good will rather than the monotonous , metallic chant of The poor have no Christmas the poor have no Christmas the poor have no Christmas that Arnie always seemed to hear as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Santas grew more harried and hollow-eyed . They held hands until the parcels grew too many for that , and then Arnie complained goodnaturedly about how she was turning him into her beast of burden . As they were going down to the lower level and B. Dalton , where Arnie wanted to look for a book on toy-making for Dennis Guilder 's old man , Leigh noticed that it had begun to snow . They stood for a moment at the window of the glassed-in stairwell , looking out like children . Arnie took her hand and Leigh looked at him , smiling . He could smell her skin , clean and a bit soapy ; he could smell the fragrance of her hair . He moved his head forward a bit ; she moved hers a bit toward him . They kissed lightly and she squeezed his hand . Later , after the bookstore , they stood above the rink in the center of the mall , watching the skaters as they dipped and pirouetted and swooped to the sound of Christmas carols . It was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost died . She almost surely would have died , if not for the hitchhiker . They had been on their way back then , and an early December twilight had long since turned to snowy dark . Christine , surefooted as usual , purred easily through the four inches of fresh light powder . Arnie had made a reservation for an early dinner at the British Lion Steak House , Libertyville 's only really good restaurant , but the time had gotten away from them and they had agreed on a quick to-go meal from the McDonald 's on JFK Drive . Leigh had promised her mother shep249would be in by eight-thirty because the Cabots were " having friends in , " and it had been quarter of eight when they left the mall . " Just as well , " Arnie said . " I 'm damn near broke anyway . " The headlights picked out the hitchhiker standing at the intersection of Route 17 and JFK Drive , still five miles outside of Libertyville . His black hair was shoulder-length , speckled with snow , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hitchhiker held up a sign painted with Day-Glo letters . It read : LIBERTYVILLE , PA . As they drew closer , he flipped it over . The other side read : NON-PSYCHO COLLEGE STUDENT . Leigh burst out laughing . " Let 's give him a ride , Arnie . " Arnie said , " When they go out of their way to advertise their nonpsychoticstatus , that 's when you got to look out . But okay . " He pulled over . That evening he would have tried to catch the moon in a bushel i basket if Leigh had asked him to give it a shot . Christine rolled smoothly to the verge of the road , tires barely slipping . But as they stopped , static blared across the radio , which had been playing some hard rock tune , and when the static cleared , there was the Big Bopper , singing " Chantilly Lace . " " What happened to the Block Party Weekend ? " Leigh asked as the hitchhiker ran toward them . " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Sometimes all that Christine 's radio would pick up was WDIL . It did n't matter what buttons you pushed or how much you fooled with the FM converter under the dashboard ; it was WDIL or nothing . He suddenly felt that stopping for the hitchhiker had been a mistake . But it was too late for second thoughts now ; the fellow had opened one of Christine 's rear doors , tossed his duffel-bag onto the floor , and slipped in after it . A blast of cold air and a swirl of snow came in with him . " Ah , man , thanks . " He sighed . " My fingers and toes all took off for Miami Beach about twenty minutes ago . They must have gone somewhere , anyway , cause I sure ca n't feel em anymore . " " Thank my lady , " Arnie said shortly . " Thank you , ma'am , " the hitchhiker said , tipping an invisible hat gallantly . " Do n't mention it , " Leigh said , and smiled . " Merry Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " although you 'd never know there was such a thing if you 'd been standing out there trying to hook a ride tonight . People just breeze by and then they 're gone . Voom . " He looked around appreciatively . " Nice car , man . Hell of a nice car . "  | " Thanks , " Arnie said . " You restore it yourself ? " " Yeah . " Leigh was looking at Arnie , puzzled . His earlier expansive mood had been replaced by a curtness that was not like his usual self at all . On the radio , the Big Bopper finished and Richie Valens came on , doing " La Bamba . " The hitchhiker shook his head and laughed . " First the Big Bopper , then Richie Valens . Must be death night on the radio . Good old WDIL . " " What do you mean ? " Leigh asked . Arnie snapped the radio off . " They died in a plane crash . With Buddy Holly . " " Oh , " Leigh said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change in Arnie 's mood ; he fell silent and meditative in the back seat . Outside , the snow began to fall faster and harder . The first good storm of the season had come in . At length , the golden arches twinkled up out of the snow . " Do you want me to go in , Arnie ? " Leigh asked . Arnie had gone nearly as quiet as stone , turning aside her bright attempts at conversation with mere grunts . " I will , " he said , and pulled in . " What do you want ? " " Just a hamburger and french fries , please . " She had intended to go the whole hog  --  Big Mac , shake , even the cookies  --  but her appetite seemed to have shrunk away to nothing . Arnie parked . In the yellow light flaring from the squat brick building'sundersides , his face looked jaundiced and somehow diseased . He turned around , arm trailing over the seat . " Can I grab you something ? " " No thanks , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't disappoint my mom . She kills the fatted calf every time I come h  --  " The chunk of the door cut off his final word . Arnie had gotten out and was headed briskly across to the IN door , his boots kicking up little puffs of new snow . " Is he always that cheery ? " the hitchhiker asked . " Or does he get sorta taciturn sometimes ? " " He 's very sweet , " Leigh said firmly . She was suddenly nervous . Arnie had turned off the engine and taken the keys , and she was left alone with this stranger in the back seat . She could see him in the rearview mirror , and suddenly his long black hair , tangled by the wind , his scruff of beard , and his dark eyes made him seem Manson-like and wild.  | " Where do you go to school ? " she asked . Her fingers were plucking at her slacks , and she made them stop . " Pitt , " the hitchhiker said , and no more . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily to her lap . Cranberry red slacks . She had worn them because Arnie had once told her he liked them  --  probably because they were the tightest pair she owned , even tighter than her Levi 's . She suddenly wished she had worn something else , something that could be considered provocative by no stretch of the imagination : a grain-sack , maybe . She tried to smile  --  it was a funny thought , all right , a grain-sack , get it , ha-ha-ho-ho , wott a kneeslapperbutno smile came . There was no way she could keep from admitting it to herself : Arnie had left her alone with this stranger ( as punishment ? it had been her idea to pick him up ) , and now she was scared . " Bad vibes , " the hitchhiker said suddenly , making her actually catch her breath . His words were flat and final . She could see Arnie through the plate-glass window , standing fifth or sixth in line . He would n't get up to the counter for a while . She found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat . Of course she could reach the horn-ring . . . but would the horn sound ? She found herself doubting it for no sane reason at all . She found herself thinking that she could hit the horn ninety-nine times and it would honk satisfyingly . But if , on the hundredth , she was being strangled by this hitchhikeron whose behalf she had interceded , the horn would n't blow . Because .. . because Christine did n't like her . In fact , she believed that Christine hated her guts . It was as simple as that . Crazy but simple . " P-Pardon me ? " She glanced back in the rearview mirror and was immeasurably relieved to see that the hitchhiker was n't looking at her at all ; he was glancing around the car . He touched the seat cover with his palm , then lightly brushed the roof upholstery with the tips of his fingers . " Bad vibes , " he said , and shook his head . " This car , I do n't know why , but I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , hoping her voice sounded neutral . " Yeah . I got stuck in an elevator once when I was a little kid . Ever since then I get attacks of claustrophobia . I never had one in a car before , but boy , I got one now . In the worst way . I think you could light a kitchen match on my tongue , that 's how dry my mouth is . " He laughed a short , embarrassed laugh . " If I was n't already so late , I 'd just get out and walk . No offense to you or your guy 's car , " he added hastily , and when Leigh looked back into the mirror his eyes did not seem wild at all , only nervous . Ap/parently he was n't kidding about the claustrophobia , and he no longer looked like Charlie Manson to her at all . Leigh wondered how she could have been so stupid . . . except she knew how , and why . She knew perfectly well . It was the car . All day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now her former nervousness and dislike were back . She had merely projected her feelings onto the hitchhiker because . . well , because you could be scared and nervous about some guy you just picked up off the road , but it was insane to be scared by a car , an inanimateconstruct of steel and glass and plastic and chrome . That was n't just a little eccentric , it was insane . " You do n't smell anything , do you ? " he asked abruptly . " Smell anything ? " " A bad smell . " " No , not at all . " Her fingers were plucking at the bottom of her sweater now , pulling off wisps of angora . Her heart was knocking unpleasantlyin her chest . " It must be part of your claustrophobia whatzis . " " I guess so . " But she could smell it . Under the good new smells of leather and upholsterythere was a faint odor : something like gone-over eggs . Just a whiff . . . a lingering whiff . " Mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want , " Leigh said , and found it took some effort to keep her voice steady and casual . Suddenly her mind 's eye showed her the picturethat had been in the paper yesterday morning , a picture of Moochie Welch probably culled from the yearbook . The caption beneath read : Peter Welch , victim of fatal hit-and-run incident that police feel may have been murder . The hitchhiker unrolled his window three inches and crisp cold air came in , driving that smell away . Inside McD 's , Arnie had reached the counter and was giving his order . Looking at him , Leigh experienced such an odd swirl of love and fear that she felt nauseated by the mixture  --  for the second or third time lately she found herself wishing that she had fixed on Dennis first , Dennis who seemed so safe and sensible . . She turned her thoughts away from that . " Just tell me if it gets cold on you , " the hitchhiker said apologetically . " I 'm weird , I know it . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up drugs , you know ? " Leigh smiled  |p253Arnie  came out with a white bag , skidded a little in the snow , and then got behind the wheel . " Cold like an icebox in here , " he grunted . " Sorry , man , " the hitchhiker said from the back , and rolled the windowup again . Leigh waited to see if that smell would come back , but now she could smell nothing but leather , upholstery , and the faint aroma of Arnie 's aftershave . " Here you go , Leigh . " He gave her a burger , fries , and a small Coke . He had gotten himself a Big Mac . " Want to thank you again for the ride , man , " the hitchhiker said . " You can just drop me off at the corner of JFK and Center , if that 's cool . " " Fine , " Arnie said shortly , and pulled out . The snow was coming down even more heavily now , and the wind had begun to whoop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she felt for a grip on the wide street , which was now almost deserted . They were less than fifteen minutes from home . With the smell gone , Leigh discovered that her appetite had come back . She wolfed half of her hamburger , drank some Coke , and stifled a burp with the back of her hand . The corner of Center and JFK , marked with a war memorial , came up on the left , and Arnie pulled over , pumping the brakes lightly so Christine would n't slide . " Have a nice weekend , " Arnie said . He sounded more like his usual self now . Maybe all he needed was some food , Leigh thought , amused . " Same goes to both of you , " the hitchhiker said . " And have a merry Christmas . " " You too , " Leigh said . She took another bite of her hamburger , chewed , swallowed . . . and felt it lodge halfway down her throat . Suddenlyshe could n't breathe . The hitchhiker was getting out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound of the latch clicking sounded like the thud of tumblersfalling in a bank-vault . The sound of the wind was like a factory whistle. ( this is stupid I know but I ca n't Arnie I ca n't breathe ) I 'm choking ! she tried to say , and what came out was a faint , fuzzy sound that she was sure the whine of the wind must have covered . She clawed at her throat and it felt swollen and throbbing in her hand . She tried to scream . No breath to scream , no breath ( Arnie I ca n't ) at all , and she could feel it in there , a warm lump of burger and bun.  |p254She  tried to cough it up and it would n't come . The dashboard lights , bright green , circular ( cat like the eyes of a cat dear God I ca n't BREATHE ) watching her --  ( God I ca n't BREATHE ca n't BREATHE ca n't ) Her chest began to pound for air . Again she tried to cough up the lump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't come . Now the sound of the wind was bigger than the world , bigger than any sound she had ever heard before , and Arnie was finally turning away from the hitchhiker to look at her ; he was turning in slow motion , his eyes widening almost comically , and even his voice seemed too loud , like thunder , the voice of Zeus speaking to some poor mortal from behind a massy skystack of thunderclouds : " LEIGH . .. ARE YOU ... WHAT T H E HELL ? . . SHE 'S CHOKING ! OH MY GOD SHE 'S  --  " He reached for her in slow motion , and then he drew his hands back , immobilized by panic ( Oh help me help me for God 's sake do something I 'm dying oh my dear God I 'm choking to death on a McDonald 's hamburger Arnie why do n't you HELP ME ? ) and of course she knew why , he drew back because Christine did n't want her to have any help , this was Christine 's way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the other woman , the competition , and now the dashboard instruments really were eyes , great round unemotionaleyes watching her choke to death , eyes she could see only through a growing jitter of black dots , dots that burst and spread as ( mamma oh my dear this I 'm dying and SHE SEES ME SHE IS ALIVE ALIVE ALIVE OH MAMMA MY GOD CHRISTINE IS ALIVE ) Arnie reached for her again . Now she had begun to thrash on the seat , her chest heaving spasmodically as she clawed at her throat . Her eyes were bulging . Her lips had begun to turn blue . Arnie was pounding her ineffectually on the back and yelling something . He grabbed her shoulder , apparently meaning to pull her out of the car , and then he suddenly winced and straightened , his hands going involuntarily to the small of his back . Leigh twitched and thrashed . The blockage in her throat felt huge and hot and throbbing . She tried again to cough it up , more weakly this time . The lump did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to fade , everything was beginning to fade , but her need for air did n't seem so awful . Maybe she was dying , but suddenly it ' ' Aid n't seemp255so bad . Nothing was so bad , except for those green eyes staring at her from the instrument panel . They were n't unemotional anymore . Now they were blazing with hate and triumph. ( o my God I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee I am for offending this is my act my act of of ) Arnie had reached across from the driver 's side . Now Leigh 's door was suddenly jerked open and she spilled sideways into a brutal , cutting cold . The air partially revived her , made her struggle for breath seem important again , but the obstruction would n't move . .. it just would n't move . From far away , Arnie 's voice thundering sternly , the voice of Zeus : " WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER ! " Arms around her . Strong arms . The wind on her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a sinner this is my act of contrition I am heartily sorry for having off ended OH ! OWWW ! what are you DOING my ribs hurts what what are you ) and suddenly there were arms around her , crushing , and a pair of hard hands were clasped together in a knot just below her breasts , in the hollow of her solar plexus . And suddenly one thumb popped up , the thumb of a hitchhiker signalling for a ride , only the thumb drove painfully into her breastbone . At the same time the grip of the arms tightened brutally . She felt caught ( Ohhhhhhh you 're breaking my RIBS ) in a gigantic bearhug . Her whole diaphragm seemed to heave , and something flew out of her mouth with the force of a projectile . It landed in the snow : a wet chunk of bun and meat . " Let her go ! " Arnie was shouting as he slipped and slid around Christine 's rear deck to where the hitchhiker held Leigh 's limp body like a life-sized marionette . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to breathe in great , tearing gasps . Her throat and lungs seemed to burn in rivers of fire with each gulp of the cold , wonderful air . She was dimly aware that she was sobbing . The brutal bearhug relaxed and the hands let her go . " Are you okay , girl ? Are you all  --  " Then Arnie was reaching past her , grabbing for the hitchhiker . He turned toward Arnie , his long black hair flying in the wind , and Arnie hit him in the mouth . The hitchhiker flailed backward , boots slipping in the snow , and landed on his back . Fresh snow as fine and dry as confectioners ' sugar puffed up around him . Arnie advanced , fists held up , eyes slitted.  |p256She  took another convulsive breath  --  oh , it hurt , it was like being stabbed with knives  --  and screamed : " What are you doing , Arnie ? Stop it ! " He turned toward her , dazed . " Huh ? Leigh ? " " He saved my life , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much and the black dots began to spiral up before her eyes again . She could have leaned against the car , but she did n't want to go near it , did n't want to touch it . The dashboard instruments . Something had happened to the dashboard instruments . Something ( eyes they turned into eyes ) she did n't want to think about . She staggered to a lamppost instead and hung onto it like a drunk , head down , panting . A soft , tentative arm went around her waist . " Leigh . . . honey , are you all right ? " She turned her head slightly and saw his miserable , scared face . She burst into tears . The hitchhiker approached them carefully , wiping his bloody mouth on the sleeve of his jacket . " Thank you , " Leigh said between harsh , swift breaths . The pain was ebbing a trifle now , and the hard , cold wind was soothing on her hot face . " I was choking . I think . . . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Too much . The black dots again , all sounds fading into an eerie wind-tunnel again . She put her head down and waited for it to pass . " It 's the Heimlich Maneuver , " the hitchhiker said . " They make you learn it when you go to work in the cafeteria . At school . Make you practice on a rubber dummy . Daisy Mae , they call her . And you do it , but you do n't have any idea if it 'll  --  you know  --  work on a real person or not . " His voice was shaky , jumping in pitch from low to high and back to low again like the voice of a kid entering puberty . His voice seemed to want to laugh or cry  --  something  --  and even in the uncertain light and heavily falling snow , Leigh could see how pallid his face was . " I never thought I 'd actually have to use it . Works pretty good . Did you see that fucking piece of meat fly ? " The hitchhiker wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood on the palm of his hand . " I 'm sorry I hit you , " Arnie said . He sounded close to tears . " I was just . . . I was . . . " " Sure , man , I know . " He clapped Arnie on the shoulder . " No harm , no foul . Girl , are you all right ? " " Yes , " Leigh said . Her breath was coming evenly now . Her heart was slowing down . Only her legs were bad ; they were so much helplessp257rubber . My God , she thought . I could be dead now . If we had n't picked that guy up , and we almost didn't -- It occurred to her that she was lucky to be alive . This cliche struck her forcibly with a stupid , undeniable power that made her feel faint . She began to cry harder . When Arnie led her back toward the car , she came with him , her head on his shoulder . " Well , " the hitchhiker said uncertainly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What 's your name ? You saved my life , I 'd like to know your name . " " Barry Gottfried , " the hitchhiker said . " At your service . " Again he swept off an imaginary hat . " Leigh Cabot , " she said . " This is Arnie Cunningham . Thank you again . " " For sure , " Arnie added , but Leigh heard no real thanks in his voice  --  only that shakiness . He handed her into the car and suddenly the smell assaulted her , attacked her : nothing mild this time , much more than just a whiff underneath . It was the smell of rot and decomposition , high and noxious . She felt a mad fright invade her brain and she thought : It is the smell of her furyThe world slipped sideways in front of her . She leaned out of the car and threw up . Then everything there went gray for a little while . " Are you sure you 're all right ? " Arnie asked her for what seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be for one of the last , Leigh realized with some relief . She felt very , very tired . There was a dull , throbbing pain in her chest and another one at her temples . " I 'm fine now . " " Good . Good . " He moved irresolutely , as if wanting to go but not sure it would be right yet ; perhaps not until he had asked his seemingly eternal question at least once more . They were standing in front of the Cabot house . Oblongsof yellow light spilled from the windows and lay smoothly on the fresh and unmarked snow . Christine stood at the curb , idling , showing parking lights . " You scared me when you fainted like that , " Arnie said . " I did n't faint . . . I only got fogged in for a few minutes . " " Well , you scared me . I love you , you know . " She looked at him gravely . " Do you ? " " Of course I do ! Leigh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . She was tired , but it had to be said , andp258said right now . Because if she did n't say it now , what had happened would seem completely ridiculous by morninglight  --  or maybe more than ridiculous ; by morninglight the idea would likely seem mad . A smell that came and went like the " mouldering stench " in a Gothic horrorstory ? Dashboard instruments that turned into eyes ? And most of all the insane feeling that the car had actually tried to kill her ? By tomorrow , even the fact that she had almost choked to death would be nothing but a vague ache in her chest and the conviction that it had been nothing , really , not a close call at all . Except it was all true , and Arnie knew it was  --  yes , some part of him did  --  and it had to be said now . " Yes , I think you do love me , " she said slowly . She looked at him steadily . " But I wo n't go anywhere with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , you 'll get rid of it . " The expression of shock on his face was so large and so sudden that she might have struck him in the face . " What  --  what are you talking about , Leigh ? " Was it shock that had caused that slapped expression ? Or was some of it guilt ? " You heard what I said . I do n't think you 'll get rid of it  --  I do n't know if you even can anymore  --  but if you want to go someplace with me , Arnie , we go on the bus . Or thumb a ride . Or fly . But I 'm never going to ride in your car again . It 's a death-trap . " There . She had said it ; it was out . Now the shock on his face was turning to anger  --  the blind , obdurate sort of anger she had seen on his face so frequently lately . Not just over the big things , but over the little ones as well  --  a woman going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who held up traffic just before it was their turn to go  --  but it came to her now with all the force of a revelationthat his anger , corrosive and so unlike the rest of Arnie 's personality , was always associated with the car . With Christine . " If you love me you 'll get rid of it , " he repeated . " You know who you sound like ? " " No , Arnie . " " My mother , that 's who you sound like . " " I 'm sorry . " She would not allow herself to be drawn ; neither would she defend herself with words or end it by just going into the house . She might have been able to if she did n't feel anything for him , but she did . Her original impressions  --  that behind the quiet shyness Arnie Cunninghamwas good and decent and kind ( and maybe sexy as well )  --  had not changed much . It was the car , that was all . That was the change . Itp259was like watching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , corroding , addictive drug . Arnie ran his hands through his snow-dusted hair , a characteristic gesture of bewilderment and anger . " You had a bad choking spell in the car , okay , I can understand that you do n't feel great about it . But it was the hamburger , Leigh , that 's all . Or maybe not even that . Maybe you were trying to talk while you were chewing or inhaled at just the wrong second or something . You might as well blame Ronald McDonald . Peoplechoke on their food every now and then , that 's all . Sometimes they die . You did n't . Thank God for that . But to blame my car  --  ! " Yes , it all sounded perfectly plausible . And was . Except that something was going on behind Arnie 's gray eyes . A frantic something that was not precisely a lie , but . .. rationalization ? A willful turning away from the truth ? " Arnie , " she said , " I 'm tired and my chest hurts and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've only got the strength to say this once . Will you listen ? " " If it 's about Christine , you 're wasting your breath , " he said , and that stubborn , mulish look was on his face again . " It 's crazy to blame her and you know it is . " " Yes , I know it 's crazy , and I know I 'm wasting my breath , " Leigh said . " But I 'm asking you to listen . " " I 'll listen . " She took a deep breath , ignoring the pull in her chest . She looked at Christine , idling a plume of white vapor into the thickly falling snow , then looked hastily away . Now it was the parking lights that looked like eyes : the yellow eyes of a lynx . " When I choked . . . when I was choking . . . the instrument panel . ... the lights on it changed . They changed . They were . . . no , I wo n't go that far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short bark in the cold air . In the house a curtain was pulled aside , someone looked out , and then the curtain dropped back again . " If that hitchhiker .. . that Gottfried fellow . .. if he had n't been there , I would have died , Arnie . I would have died . " She searched his eyes with her own and pushed ahead . Once , she told herself . I only have to say this once . " You told me that you worked in the cafeteria at LHS your first three years . I 've seen the Heimlich Maneuver poster on the door to the kitchen . You must have seen it too . But you did n't try that on me , Arnie . You were getting ready to clap me on the back . That does n't work . I had a job in a restaurant back in Massachusetts , and thep260first thing they teach you , even before they teach you the Heimlich Maneuver , is that clapping a choking victim on the back does n't work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin , out-of-breath voice . She did n't answer ; only looked at him . He met her gaze for only a moment , and then his eyes  --  angry , confused , almost haunted  --  shifted away . " Leigh , people forget things . You 're right , I should have used it . But if you had the course , you know you can use it on yourself . " Arnie laced his hands together into a fist with one thumb sticking up and pressed against his diaphragm to demonstrate . " It 's just that in the heat of the moment , people forget  --  " " Yes , they do . And you seem to forget a lot of things in that car . Like how to be Arnie Cunningham . " Arnie was shaking his head . " You need time to think this over , Leigh . You need  --  " " That is just what I do n't need ! " she said with a fierceness she would n't have believed she still had left in her . " I never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stuff like that  --  but now I wonder just what 's going on and what 's happening to you . They looked like eyes , Arnie . And later ... afterward . . . there was a smell . A horrible , rotten smell . " He recoiled . " You know what I 'm talking about . " " No . I do n't have the slightest idea . " " You just jumped as if the devil had twisted your ear . " " You 're imagining things , " Arnie said hotly . " A lot of things . " " That smell was there . And there are other things as well . Sometimes your radio wo n't get anything but that oldies station  --  " Another flicker in his eyes , and a slight twitch at the left corner of his mouth . " And sometimes when we 're making out it just stalls , as if it did n't like it . As if the car did n't like it , Arnie . " " You 're upset , " he said with ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , beginning to cry . " Are n't you ? " The tears trickled slowly down her cheeks . I think this is the end of it for us , Arnie  --  Iloved you , but I think it 's over . I really think it is , and that makes me feel so sad , and so sorry . " Your relationship with your parents has turned into a . . . an armed camp , you 're running God knows what into New York and Vermont for that fat pig Will Darnell , and that car . . that car . . . " She could not say anything more . Her voice dissolved . She droppedp261her packages and bent blindly to pick them up . Exhausted and weeping , she succeeded in doing little more than stirring them around . He bent to help her and she pushed at him roughly . " Leave them alone ! I 'll get them ! " He stood up , his face pale and set . His expression was one of wooden fury , but his eyes . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " he said , and now his voice roughened with his own tears . " Good . Join up with the rest of them if you want . You just saddle up and ride right along with all those other shitters . Who gives a tin shit ? " He drew in a shivering breath , and a single hurt sob escaped him before he could clap a gloved hand brutally over his mouth . He began to walk backward toward the car ; he reached out blindly behind himself for the Plymouth and Christine was there . " Just as long as you know you 're crazy . Right out of your mind ! So go on and play your games ! I do n't need you ! I do n't need any of yourHis voice rose to a thin scream , in devilish harmony with the wind : " I do n't need you so fuck off ! " He rushed around to the driver 's side , his feet slid , and he grabbed for Christine . She was there and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlights came on in a huge white glare , and the Furypulled out , rear tires spinning up a fog of snow . Now the tears came fast and hard as she stood watching the taillights fade to round red periods and wink out as the car went around the corner . Her packages lay scattered at her feet . And then , suddenly , her mother was there , absurdly clothed in an open raincoat , green rubber boots , and her blue flannel nightgown . " Honey , what 's wrong ? " " Nothing , " Leigh sobbed . I almost choked to death , I smelled something that might have come from a freshly opened tomb , and I think . . . yes , I think that somehow that car is alive . . . more alive every day . I think it 's like some kind of horrible vampire , only it 's taking Arnie 's mind to feed itself . His mind and his spirit . " Nothing , nothing 's wrong , I had a fight with Arnie , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They picked up Leigh 's parcels and went in . The door shut behind them and the night belonged to the wind and to the swiftly falling snow . By morning there would be better than eight inches . Arnie cruised until sometime after midnight , and later had no memory of it . The snow had filled the streets ; they were deserted andp262ghostly . It was not a night for the great American motor-car . Nevertheless , Christine moved through the deepening storm with surefooted ease , even without snow tires . Now and then the prehistoric shape of a snowplow loomed and was gone . The radio played . It was WDIL all the way across the dial . The news came on . Eisenhower had predicted , at the AFL/ CIO convention , a futureof labor and management marching harmoniously into the future together . Dave Beck had denied that the Teamsters Union was a front for the rackets . Rock ' n roller Eddie Cochran had been killed in a car crash while en route to London 's Heathrow Airport ; three hours of emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rattling their ICBMs . WDIL played the oldies all week long , but on the weekendsthey got really dedicated . Fifties newscasts , wow . That was ( never heard anything like that before ) a really neat idea . That was ( totally insane ) pretty neat . The weather promised more snow . Then music again : Bobby Darin singing " Splish-Splash , " Ernie K-Doe singing " Mother-in-Law , " the Malin twins singing " When . " The wipers beat time . He looked to his right , and Roland D. LeBay was riding shotgun . Roland D. LeBay sat there in his green pants and a faded shirt of Army twill , looking out of dark eyesockets . A beetle sat , preening , within one . You have to make them pay , Roland D. LeBay said . You have to make the shitters pay , Cunningham . Every last fucking one of them . " Yes , " Arnie whispered . Christine hummed through the night , cuttingthe snow with fresh , sure tracks . " Yes , that 's a fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Chrysler to Mexico , boy .  - -  Z . Z. TopAt Libertyville High , Coach Puffer had given way to Coach Jones , and football had given way to basketball . But nothing really changed : the LHS cagers did n't do much better than the LHS gridiron warriors  --  the only bright spot was Lenny Barongg , a three-sport man whose major one was basketball . Lenny stubbornly went about having the great year he needed to have if he was going to get the athletic scholarship to Marquette that he lusted after . Sandy Galion suddenly blew town . One day he was there , the next he was gone . His mother , a forty-five-year-old wino who did n't look a day over sixty , did not seem terribly concerned . Neither did his younger brother , who pushed more dope than any other kid in Gornick Junior High . A romantic rumor that he had cut out for Mexico made the rounds at Libertyville High . Another , less romantic , rumor also made the rounds : that Buddy Repperton had been on Sandy about something and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Christmas break approached and the school 's atmosphere grew restless and rather thundery , as it always did before a long vacation . The student body 's overall grade average took its customary preChristmasdip . Book reports were turned in late and often bore a suspiciousresemblance to jacket copy ( after all , how many sophomore English students are apt to call The Catcher in the Rye " this burning classic of postwar adolescence " ? ) . Class projects were left half done or undone , the percentage of detention periods given for kissing and pettingin the halls skyrocketed , and busts for marijuana went way up as the Libertyville High School students indulged in a little pre-Christmas cheer . So a good many of the students were up ; teacher absenteeism was up ; in the hallways and home-rooms , Christmas decorations were up . Leigh Cabot was not up . She flunked an exam for the first time in her high school career and got a D on an executive typing drill . She couldp264not seem to study ; she found her mind wandering back , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments that had becomehateful , gloating cat's-eyes , watching her choke to death . But for most , the last week of school before the Christmas break was a mellow period when offenses which would have earned detention slips at other times of the year were excused , when hard-hearted teachers would sometimes actually throw a scale on an exam where everyone had done badly , when girls who had been bitter enemies made it up , and when boys who had scuffled repeatedly over real or imagined insultsdid the same . Perhaps more indicative of the mellow season than anything else was the fact that Miss Rat-Pack , the gorgon of Room 23 study hall , was seen to smile . . . not just once , but several times . In the hospital , Dennis Guilder was moderately up  --  he had swapped his bedfast traction casts for walking casts . Physical therapy was no longer the torture it had been . He swung through corridors that had been strung with tinsel and decorated with first- , second- , and thirdgradeChristmas pictures , his crutches thump-thumping along , sometimes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a caesura , a lull , an interlude , a period of quiet . During his seemingly endless walks up and down the hospital corridors , Dennis reflected that things could be worse  --  much , much worse . Before too long , they were .

Even a man with one eye could seeSomething bad is gon na happen to me .. .  --  The InmatesOn Tuesday , December 12 , the Terriers lost to the Buccaneers 54  --  48 in the Libertyville High gym . Most of the fans went out into the still black cold of the night not too disappointed : every sportswriter in the Pittsburgh area had predicted another loss for the Terriers . The resultp265could hardly be called an upset . And there was Lenny Barongg for the Terriers fans to be proud of : He scored a mind-boggling 34 points all by himself , setting a new school record . Buddy Repperton , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at great pains to be disappointed . So was Bobby Stanton in the back seat . In the few months since he had been ushered out of LHS , Buddy seemed to have aged . Part of it was the beard . He looked less like Clint Eastwood and more like some hard-drinking young actor 's version of Captain Ahab . Buddy had been doing a lot of drinking these last few weeks . He had been having dreams so terrible he could barely remember them . He awoke sweaty and trembling , feeling he had barely escaped some awful doom that ran dark and quiet . The booze cut them off , though . Cut them right off at the fucking knees . Goddam right . Working nights and sleeping days , that 's all it was . He unrolled the window of his scuffed and dented Camaro , scooping in frigid air , and tossed out an empty bottle . He reached back over his shoulder and said , " Another Molotov cocktail , mess-sewer . " " Right on , Buddy , " Bobby Stanton said respectfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buddy had treated them to a case of the stuff  --  enough to paralyze the entire Egyptian Navy , he said  --  after the game . He spun off the cap , steering momentarily with his elbows , and then gulped down half the bottle . He handed it to Richie and uttered a long , froggy belch . The Camaro 's headlights cut Route 46 , running northeast as straight as a string through rural Pennsylvania . Snow-covered fields lay dreaming on either side of the road , twinkling in a billion points of light that mimed the stars in the black winter sky . He was headed  --  in a sort of casual , half-drunk way  --  for Squantic Hills . Another destination might take his fancy in the meantime , but if not , the Hills were a fine and private place to get high in peace . Richie passed the bottle back to Bobby again , who drank big even though he hated the taste of Texas Driver . He supposed that when he got a little drunker , he would n't mind the taste at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but tomorrow was a thousand years away . Bobby was still excited just to be with them ; he was only a freshman , and Buddy Repperton , with his near-mythic reputation for bigness and badness , was a figure he viewed with mixed fear and awe . " Fucking clowns , " Buddy said morosely . " What a bunch of fucking clowns . You call that a basketball game ? "  | " All a bunch of retards , " Richie agreed . " Except for Barongg . Thirty-four points , not too tacky . " " I hate that fucking spade , " Buddy said , giving Richie a long , measuring , drunken look . " You taking up for that jungle bunny ? " " No way , Buddy , " Richie said promptly . " Better not . I 'll Barongg him . " " Which do you want first ? " Bobby asked abruptly from the back seat , " The good news or the bad news ? " " Bad news first , " Buddy said . He was into his third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aggrieved anger . He had forgotten  --  at least for the moment  --  that he had been expelled ; he was concentrating only on the fact that the old school team , that bunch of fucking retard assholes , had let him down . " Always bad news first . " The Camaro rolled northeast at sixty-five over two-lane tar that was like a swipe of black paint across a hilly white floor . The land had begun to rise slightly as they approached Squantic Hills . " Well , the bad news is that a million Martians just landed in New York , " Bobby said . " Now you wan na hear the good news ? " " There is no good news , " Buddy said in a low , morose , grieving voice . Richie would have liked to tell the kid you did n't try to cheer Buddy up when he was in a mood like this ; that only made it worse . The thing to do was to let it run its course . Buddy had been this way ever since Moochie Welch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some psycho on JFK Drive . " The good news is that they eat niggers and piss gasoline , " Bobby said , and roared with laughter . He laughed for quite a while before he realized he was laughing alone . Then he shut up quickly . He glanced up and saw Buddy 's bloodshot eyes looking at him over the uppermost tendrils of his beard , and that red , ferrety gaze floating in the rearview mirror gave him an unpleasant thrill of fear . It occurred to Bobby Stantonthat he might have shut up a minute or two too late . Behind them , distant , perhaps as much as three miles back , headlightstwinkled like insignificant yellow sparks in the night . " You think that 's funny ? " Buddy asked . " You tell a fucking racist joke like that and you think it 's funny ? You 're a fucking bigot , you know that ? " Bobby 's mouth dropped open . " But you said  --  " " I said I did n't like Barongg . In general I think spades are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , almost as good . "  | " But  --  " " You want to watch out or you 'll be walking home , " Buddy snarled . " With a rupture . Then you can write I HATE NIGGERS all over your fuckin truss . " " Oh , " Bobby said in a small , scared voice . He felt as if he had reached up to turn on a light and had got a whopper of an electric shock . " Sorry . " " Give me that bottle and shut your head . " Bobby handed the Driver up front with alacrity . His hand was shaking . Buddy killed the bottle . They passed a sign which read SQUANTIC HILLS STATE PARK 3 MI . The lake at the center of the state park was a popular beach area in the summertime , but the park was closed from November to April . The road which wound through the park to SquanticLake was kept plowed for periodic National Guard maneuvers and winter Explorer Scouts camping trips , however , and Buddy had discovered a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park road . Buddy liked to go into the silent , wintry state park and cruise and drink . Behind them , the distant twin sparks had grown to circles  --  dual headlights about a mile back . " Hand me up another Molotov cocktail , you fucking racist pig . " Bobby handed up a fresh bottle of Driver , remaining prudently silent . Buddy drank deeply , belched , and then handed the bottle across toRichie . " No thanks , man . " " You drink it , or you may find yourself getting an enema with it . " " Sure , okay , " Richie said , wishing mightily that he had stayed home tonight . He drank . The Camaro sped along , its headlights cutting the night . Buddy glanced into the rearview and saw the other car . It was now coming up fast . He glanced at his speedometer and saw he was doing sixty-five . The car behind them had to be doing close to seventy . Buddy felt something  --  a curious kind of doubling back to the dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press lightly against his heart . Ahead , the road branched in two , Route 46 continuing east toward New Stanton , the other road bearing north toward Squantic Hills State Park . A large orange sign advised : CLOSED WINTER MONTHS . Barely slowing , Buddy dragged left and shot up the hill . The approachroad to the park was not so well-plowed , and overarching treesp268had kept the warm afternoon sun from melting off the snowpack . The Camaro slid a little before grabbing the road again . In the back seat , Bobby Stanton made a low , uneasy sound . Buddy looked up in the rearview , expecting tO see the other car shoot by along 46  --  after all , there was nothing up this road but a dead end as far as most drivers were concerned  --  but instead it took the turn even faster than Buddy had and pounded along after them , now less than a quarter of a mile behind . Its headlights were four glowing white circles that washed the Camaro 's interior . Bobby and Richie turned around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Buddy knew . Suddenly he knew . It was the car that had run down Moochie . Oh yes it was . The psycho who had greased Moochie was behind the wheel of that car , and now he was after Buddy . He stepped down on the go , and the Camaro started to fly . The speedometer needle crept up to seventy and then gradually heeled over toward eighty . Trees blurred past , dark sketches in the night . The lights behind them did not fall back ; the truth was that they were still gaining . The duals had merged into two great white eyes . " Man , you want to slow down , " Ritchie said . He grabbed for his seatbelt , actively scared now . " If we roll at this speed  --  " Buddy did n't answer . He hunched over the wheel , alternating glances at the road ahead with glances shot into the rearview mirror , where those lights grew and grew . " The road curves up ahead , " Bobby said hoarsely . And as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's headlights , he screamed it : " Buddy ! It curves ! It curves ! " Buddy changed down to second gear and the Camaro 's engine bellowedits protest . The tachometer needle hit 6,000 rpm , danced briefly at redline-7,000 , and then dropped back into a more normal range . Backfires blatted through the Camaro 's straight-pipes like machine-gun fire . Buddy pulled the wheel over , and the car floated into the sharp bend . The rear wheels skimmed over hard-packed snow . At the last possibleinstant he shifted back up , tramped on the accelerator pedal , and let his body sway freely as the Camaro 's left rear end slammed into the snowbank , digging a coffin-sized divot and then bouncing off . The Camaroslewed the other way . He went with it , then goosed the accelerator again . For one moment he thought it would not respond , that the skid would continue and they would simply barrel sideways up the road at seventy-five until they hit a bare patch and flipped over . But the Camaro straightened out.  | " Holy Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wheel , grinning through his beard , bloodshot eyes bulging . The bottle of Driver was clamped between his legs . There ! There , you crazy murdering sonofabitch . Let 's see you do that without rolling it over ! A moment later the headlights reappeared , closer than ever . Buddy 's grin faltered and faded . For the first time he felt a sickish , unmanning tingle running up his legs toward his crotch . Fear  --  real fear  --  stole into him . Bobby had been looking behind as the car chasing them rounded the bend , and now he turned around , his face slack and cheesy . " It dint even skid , " he said . " But that 's impossible ! That 's  --  " " Buddy , who is it ? " Richie asked . He reached out to touch Buddy 's elbow , and his hand was flung away with such force that his knuckles cracked on the glass of his window . " You do n't want to touch me , " Buddy whispered . The road unrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but white snow , packed and treacherous . The Camaro was rolling over this greasy surface at better than ninety miles an hour , only its roof and the orange Ping-Pong ball jammed on the top of its radio aerial visible between chest-high embankments . " You do n't want to touch me , Richie . Not going this fast . " " Is it  --  " Richie 's voice cracked and he could n't go on . Buddy spared him a glance , and at the sight of the fear in Buddy 's small red eyes , Richie 's own terror came up in his throat like hot , smooth oil . " Yeah , " Buddy said . " I think it is . " No houses up here ; they were already on state land . Nothing up here but the high snow embankments and the dark interlacing of trees . " It 's gon na bump us ! " Bobby screeched from the back seat . His voice was as high as an old woman 's . Between his feet the remaining bottles of Texas Driver chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na bump us ! " The car behind them had come to within five feet of the Camaro 's back bumper ; its high beams flooded the car with light bright enough to read fine print . It slipped forward even closer . A moment later there was a thud . The Camaro shifted its stance on the road as the car behind them fell back a trifle ; to Buddy it was as if they were suddenly floating , and he knew they were a hair 's breadth from going into a wild , looping skid , the front end and the rear briskly swapping places until they hit somethingand rolled.  |p270A  droplet of sweat , as warm and stinging as a tear , ran into his eye . Gradually , the Camaro straightened out again . When he felt that he had control , Buddy let his right foot smoothly depress the accelerator all the way . If it was Cunningham in that old rustbucket ' 58  --  ah , and had n't that been part of the dreams he could barely remember ? the Camaro would shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tach needle was again on the edge of the red line at 7,000 rpm . The speedometer had passed the one hundred post , and the snowbanks streamed past them on either side in ghastly silence . The road ahead looked like a point-of-view shot in a film that had been insanely speeded up . " Oh dear God , " Bobby babbled , " oh dear God please do n't let me get killed oh dear God oh holy shit  --  " He was n't there the night we trashed Cuntface 's car , Buddy thought . He does n't know what 's going on . Poor busted-luck sonofawhore . He did not really feel sorry for Bobby , but if he could have been sorry for anyone , it would have been for the little shit-for-brains freshman . On his right , Richie Trelawney sat bolt upright and as pallid as a gravestone , his eyes eating up his face . Richie knew the score , all right . The car whispered toward them , headlights swelling in the rearview mirror . He ca n't be gaining ! Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car behind them was indeed gaining , and Buddy sensed it was boring in for the kill . His mind ran like a rat in a cage , looking for a way out , and there was none . The slot in the left snowbank that marked the little side road he usually used to bypass the gate and get into the state park had already flashed by . He was running out of time , room , and options . There was another soft bump , and again the Camaro slewed  --  this time at something over a hundred and ten miles an hour . No hope , man , Buddy thought fatalistically . He took his hands off the wheel altogether and grabbed his seatbelt . For the first time in his life , he snapped it shut across his waist . At the same time , Bobby Stanton in the back seat screamed in a shrill ecstasy of fear : " The gate , man ! Oh Jesus Buddy it 's the gaaaaayyyyy  --  " The Camaro had breasted a final steep hill . The far side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , becoming the ingress and egress from the state park . Between the two ways stood a small gatehouseon a concrete island  --  in the summertime , a lady sat in there on a camp chair and took a buck from each car that entered the park . Now the gatehouse was flooded with ghastly light as the two carsp271raced down toward it , the Camaro heeling steadily to port as the skid worsened . " Fuck you , Cuntf ace ! " Buddy screamed . " Fuck you and the horse you rode in on ! " He yanked the wheel all the way around , twirling it with the death-knob that held one bobbing red die in alcohol . Bobby screamed again . Richie Trelawney clapped his hands over his face , his last thought on earth a constant repetition of Watch out for broken glass watch out for broken glass watch out for broken glassThe Camaro swapped ends , and now the headlights of the car followingblared directly into them , and Buddy began to scream because it was Cuntface 's car , all right , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile wide , only there was no one behind the wheel . The car was totally empty . In the last two seconds before impact , Christine 's headlights shifted away to what was now Buddy 's left . The Fury shot into the ingress roadway as neatly and exactly as a bullet shoots down a rifle barrel . It snapped off the wooden barrier and sent it flying end over end into the black night , round yellow reflectors flashing . Buddy Repperton 's Camaro rammed ass-backwards into the concrete island where the gatehouse stood . The eight-inch concrete lip peeled off everything bolted to the lower deck , leaving the twisted wreckage of the straight-pipes and the muffler sitting on the snow like some weird sculpture . The Camaro 's rear end was first accordioned and then demolished . Bobby Stanton was demolished along with it . Buddy was dimly aware of something hitting his back like a bucket of warm water . It was Bobby Stanton 's blood . The Camaro flipped into the air end for end , a mangled projectile in a squall of flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did a complete three-sixty and came down with a glass-jangling thud and rolled over . The firewall ruptured and the engineslid backward at an angle , crushing Richie Trelawney from the waist down . There was a coughing explosion of fire from the ruptured gas tank as the Camaro came to rest . Buddy Repperton was alive . He had been cut in several places by flying glass  --  one ear had been clipped off with surgical neatness , leaving a red hole on the left side of his head  --  and his leg had been broken , but he was alive . His seatbelt had saved him . He thumbed the catch and it let go . The crackle of fire was like someone crumpling paper . He could feel the baking heat . He tried to open the door , but the door was crimped shut.  |p272Panting  hoarsely , he threw himself through the empty space where the windshield had been -- and there was Christine . She stood forty yards away , facing him at the end of a long , slewing skidmark . The rumble of her engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy licked his lips . Something in his left side pulled and jabbed with every breath . Something busted in there too . Ribs . Christine 's engine gunned and fell off ; gunned and fell off . Faintly , like something from a lunatic 's nightmare , he could hear Elvis Presley singing " Jailhouse Rock . " Orange-pink points of light on the snow . The rumbling whoosh of fire . It was going to blow . It wasIt did blow . The Camaro 's gas tank went with a hard thudding noise . Buddy felt a rude hand shove him in the back , and he flew through the air and landed in the snow on his hurt side . His jacket was flaming . He grunted and rolled in the snow , putting himself out . Then he tried to get to his knees . Behind him , the Camaro was a blazing pyre in the night . Christine 's engine , revving and falling off , revving and falling off , now more quickly , more urgently . Buddy finally managed to get to his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweaty tangles of hair hanging in his eyes . The hood had been crimped up when the Plymouth blasted through the barrier arm , and the radiator was dripping a mixture of water and antifreeze that steamed on the snow like fresh animal spoor . Buddy licked his lips again . They felt as dry as lizard skin . His back felt warm , as if he had gotten a moderately bad sunburn ; he could smell smoking cloth , but in the extremity of his shock he was unaware that both his parka and the two shirts beneath had been burned away . " Listen , " he said , hardly aware he was speaking . " Listen , hey  --  " Christine 's engine screamed and she came at him , rear end flirting back and forth as her tires spun through the sugary snow . The crimped hood was like a mouth in a frozen snarl . Buddy waited on his hands and knees , resisting the overpowering urge to leap and scramble away at once , resisting  --  as much as he could  --  the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car . A more imaginative person would already have gone mad , perhaps . At the last possible second he rolled to the left , screaming as the splintered ends of the broken bone in his leg ground together . He felt something bullet past him inches away , there was warm , foul-smellingp273exhaust in his face for a moment , and then the snow was red as Christine'staillights flashed . She wheeled , skidding , and came back at him . " No ! " Buddy screamed . Pain lanced at his chest . " No ! No ! N  --  " He leaped , blind reflexes taking over , and this time the bullet was closer , clipping leather off one shoe and turning his left foot instantly numb . He turned crazily on his hands and knees , like a small child playing I Witness at a birthday party . Blood from his mouth now mixed with the snot running freely from his nose ; one of his broken ribs had nicked a lung . Blood ran down his cheek from the hole in his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . His breath came in whistling sobs . Christine paused . White vapor drifted from her tailpipe ; her engine throbbed and purred . The windshield was a black blank . Behind Buddy , the remains of the Camaro shot greasy flames at the sky . A razor-sharp wind flutteredand fanned them . Bobby Stanton sat in the inferno of the back seat , his head cocked , a grin locked onto his blackening face . Playing with me , Buddy thought . Playing with me , that 's what it 's doing . Like a cat with a mouse . " Please , " he croaked . The headlights were blinding , turning the blood dripping down his cheek and from the sides of his mouth to an insectile black . " Please . . . I . . I 'll tell him I 'm sorry . . . I 'll crawl to him on my fucking hands and knees if that 's what you want .. . only please . .. pl  --  " The engine screamed . Christine leaped at him like old doom from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this time the bumper struck his shin and broke his other leg and threw him toward the embankment at the side of the park road . He hit and sprawled like a loose bag of grain . Christine wheeled back toward him , but Buddy had seen a chance , one thin chance . He began to scramble wildly up the embankment , digginginto the snow with bare hands from which the feeling had already departed , digging with his feet , ignoring the tremendous clouts of pain from his shattered legs . Now his breath came in little screams as the headlights grew brighter and the engine louder ; every clod of snow threw its own jagged black shadow and he could feel it , he could feel it behind him like some horrible man-eating tigerThere was a crunch and jangle of metal , and Buddy cried out as one of his feet was driven into the snow by Christine 's bumper . He yanked it out of the snow , leaving his shoe wedged deep.  |p274Laughing  , gibbering , crying , Buddy gained the top of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , tottered on the edge of balance there , pinwheeled his arms , and barely kept from rolling back down . He turned to face Christine . The Plymouth had reversed across the road and now came forward again , rear tires spinning , digging at the snow . It crashed into the bank a foot below where Buddy was perched , making him sway and sending down a minor avalanche of snow . The hit crimped her hood in further , but Buddy was not touched . She reversed again through a mist of churned-up snow , engine now seeming to howl with frustrated anger . Buddy screamed in triumph and shook his middle finger at her . " Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! " A spray of mixed blood and spittle flew from his lips . With each gasping breath , the pain seemed to sink deeper into his left side , numbing and paralyzing . Christine roared forward and slammed into the embankment again . This time a large section of the bank , loosened in the car 's first charge , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Buddy almost came down with it . He saved himself only by skitteringbackward rapidly , sliding on his butt and pulling himself with hands that were clawed into the snow like bloody grappling hooks . His legs were in agony now , and he flopped over on his side , gasping like a beached fish . Christine came again . " Get outta here ! " Buddy cried . " Get outta here , you crazy WHORE ! " She slammed into the embankment again , and this time enough snow fell to douse her hood to the windshield . The wipers came on and began to arc back and forth , flicking melting snow away . She reversed again , and Buddy saw that one more hit would send him cascading down onto Christine 's hood with the snow . He let himself fall over backward and went rolling down the far side of the embankment , screaming each time his broken ribs bumped the ground . He came to rest in loose powder , staring up at the black sky , the cold stars . His teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Christine did n't come again , but he could hear the soft mutter of her engine . Not coming , but waiting . He glanced at the snowbank bulking against the sky . Beyond it , the glow of the burning Camaro had begun to wane a bit . How long had itp275been since the crash ? He did n't know . Would anyone see the fire and come to rescue him ? He did n't know that either . Buddy became aware of two things simultaneously : that blood was flowing from his mouth  --  flowing at a frightening rate  --  and that he was very cold . He would freeze to death if someone did n't come . Frightened all over again , he struggled and thrashed his way into a sitting position . He was trying to decide if he could worm his way back up and watch the car  --  it was worse , not being able to see it  --  when he glanced up at the embankment again . His breath snagged and stopped . A man was standing there . Only it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A rotting corpse in green pants . It was shirtless , but a back brace splotched with gray mould was cinched around its blackening torso . White bone gleamed through the skin stretched across its face . " That 's it for you , you shitter , " this starlit apparition whispered . The last of Buddy 's control broke and he began to scream hysteri-f cally , his eyes bulging , his long hair seeming to puff into a grotesque helmet around his bloody , soot-smudged face as the root of each strand t stiffened and stood on end . Blood poured from his mouth in freshets and drenched the collar of his parka ; he tried to skid backward , hookinginto the snow with his hands again and sliding his buttocks as the thing came toward him . It had no eyes . Its eyes were gone , eaten out of its face by God knew what squirming things . And he could smell it , oh God he could smell it and the smell was like rotting tomatoes , the smell was death . The corpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repperton and grinned . Buddy screamed . Buddy howled . And suddenly he stiffened , his lips forming an 0 of perfect finality , puckered as if he wished to kiss the horror shambling toward him . His hands scratched and scrabbled at the left side of his shredded parka above his heart , which had finally been punctured by . the jagged stub of a splintered rib . He fell backward , feet kicking grooves in the snow , his final breath slipping out in a long white jet from his slack mouth . . . like auto exhaust . On the embankment , the thing he had seen flickered and was gone . There were no tracks . From the far side , Christine 's engine cranked up into an exhaustcracklingbellow of triumph that struck the frowning , snow-covered uplands of Squantic Hills and then echoed back . On the far verge of Squantic Lake , some ten miles away as the crow flies , a young man who had gone out for a cross-country ski by starlightp276heard the sound and suddenly stopped , his hands on his poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back prickled into bumps , as if a goose had just walked over his grave , and although he knew it was only a car somewhere on the other side  --  sound carried a long way up here on still winter nights  --  his first thought was that something prehistoric had awakened and had tracked its prey to earth : a great wolf , or perhaps a saber-toothed tiger . The sound was not repeated and he went on his way . Baby , lemme ride in your automobile , Hey , babe , lemme ride in your automobile ! Tell me , sweet baby , Tell me : Just how do you feel ?  --  Chester BurnettWill Darnell was at the garage until after midnight on the night Buddy Repperton and his friends met Christine in Squantic Hills . His emphysema had been particularly bad that day . When it got bad , he was afraid to lie down , although he was ordinarily a perfect bear for sleep . The doctor told him it was not at all likely that he would choke to death in his sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its grip on his lungs , he feared it more and more . The fact that his fear was irrational did n't change it in the least . Although he had n't been inside a church of any faith since he had been twelve years old  --  forty-nine years ago now !  --  he had been morbidly interested in the circumstancessurrounding the death of Pope John Paul I ten weeks before . John Paul had died in bed and had been found there in the morning . Already stiffening , probably . That was the part that haunted Will : Already stiffening , probably . He pulled into the garage at half-past nine , driving his 1966 Chrysler Imperial  --  the last car he intended to ever own . At about the same time Buddy Repperton was noticing the twin sparks of distant headlights in his rearview mirror.  |p277Will  was worth better than two million dollars , but money did n't give him much pleasure anymore , if indeed it ever had . The money did n't even seem completely real anymore . Nothing did , except the emphysema . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind off it . The problem of Arnie Cunningham , now  --  that had taken his mind off his emphysema . He supposed that was why he had let Cunningham hang around the place when all of his strongest instincts told him to get the kid out of the garage , he was in some way dangerous . Something was going on with Cunningham and his rebuilt ' 58 . Something very peculiar . The kid was n't in tonight ; he and the entire LHS chess club were in Philadelphia for three days at the Northern States Fall Tourney . Cunninghamhad laughed about that ; he was much changed from the pimply , big-eyed kid that Buddy Repperton had jumped on , the kid Will had immediately ( and erroneously ) dismissed as a crybaby jellyfish and maybe a goddam queer in the bargain . For one thing , he had grown cynical . He had told Will in the office yesterday afternoon over cigars ( the boy had developed a taste for those as well ; Will doubted if his parents knew ) that he had missed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was no longer a member . Slawson , the faculty advisor , knew it but was conveniently overlooking it until after the Northern States Tourney . " I 've missed more meetings than anyone , but I also happen to play better than anyone else , and the skitter knows  --  " Arnie winced and shoved both hands into the small of his back for a moment . " You ought to get a doctor to look at that , " Will remarked . Arnie winked , suddenly looking much older than nearly eighteen . " I do n't need anything but a good Christian fuck to stretch the vertebrae . " " So you 're going to Philly ? " Will had been disappointed , even though Cunningham had the off-time coming ; it meant he would have to put Jimmy Sykes in charge for the next couple of nights , and Jimmy did n't know his ass from ice cream . " Sure . I 'm not about to turn down three days of bright lights , " Arnie said . He saw Will 's sour face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This close to Christmas , all your regulars are buying toys for the kiddies instead of spark plugs and carburetor kits . This place will be dead until next year , and you know it . " That was certainly true enough , but he had n't needed a snotnose kid to point it out for him.  | " You want to go to Albany for me after you get back ? " Will had asked . Arnie looked at him carefully . " When ? " " This weekend . " " Saturday ? " " Yes . " " What 's the deal ? " " You take my Chrysler to Albany , that 's the fucking deal . Henry Buck has fourteen clean used cars he wants to get rid of . He says they 're clean . You go look at them . I 'll give you a blank check . If they look good , you make the deal . If they look hot , tell him to take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut . " " And what do I take with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Getting scared , Cun-ningham ? " " No . " Arnie crushed his cigar out half-smoked . He looked at Will defensively . " Maybe I just feel the odds getting a little longer each time I do it . Is it coke ? " " I 'll get Jimmy to do it , " Will said brusquely . " Just tell me what it is . " " Two hundred cartons of Winstons . " " All right . " " You sure ? Just like that ? " Arnie had laughed . " It 'll be a break from chess . " Will parked the Chrysler in the stall closest to his office , the one withMR . DARNELL DO NOT BLOCK ! painted inside the lines . He got outand slammed the door , puffing , laboring for breath . The emphysema was sitting on his chest , and tonight it seemed to have brought its brother . No , he just was n't going to lie down , no matter what that asshole doctor said . Jimmy Sykes was apathetically wielding the big push broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His light mental retardation made him look perhaps eight years younger . He had started combing his hair back in a fifties-style ducktail , in imitation of Cunningham , whom Jimmy almost worshipped . Except for the low whssht , whssht of the broom 's bristles on the oil-stained concrete , the place was silent . And empty . " Place is really jumpin tonight , Jimmy , huh ? " Will wheezed . Jimmy looked around . " No , sir , Mr. Darnell , nobody been in sine Mr. Hatch came and got his Fairlane , an that was half an hour ago . "  | " Just joking , " Will said , wishing again that Cunningham were here . You could n't talk to Jimmy except on a perfectly literal Dick-and-Jane level . Still , maybe he would invite him in for a cup of coffee with a slug of Courvoisier tipped in for good measure . Make it a threesome . Him , Jimmy , and the emphysema . Or maybe , since the emphysema had brought its brother tonight , you 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about  --  " He broke off suddenly , noticing that stall twenty was empty . Christinewas gone . " Arnie came in ? " he said . " Arnie ? " Jimmy repeated , blinking stupidly . " Arnie , Arnie Cunningham , " Will said impatiently . " How many Arnies do you know ? His car 's gone . " Jimmy looked around at stall twenty and frowned . " Oh . Yeah . " Will smiled . " Hotshot got knocked out of his hotshot chess tournament , huh ? " " Oh , did he ? " Jimmy asked . " Jeez , that 's too bad , huh ? " Will restrained an urge to grab Jimmy and give him a shake and a wallop . He would not get angry ; that only made it harder to breathe , and he would end up having to shoot his lungs full of the horrible-tastingstuff from his aspirator . " Well , what did he say , Jimmy ? What did he say when you saw him ? " But Will knew suddenly and surely that Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driving at . " Oh , I did n't see him . Just saw Christine go out the door , you know . Boy , that 's some pretty car , ai n't it ? He fixed it up like magic . " " Yes , " Will said . " Like magic . " It was a word that had occurred to him in connection with Christine before . He suddenly changed his mind about inviting Jimmy in for coffee and brandy . Still looking at stall twenty , he said , " You can go home now , Jimmy . " " Aw , jeez , Mr. Darnell , you said I could have six hours tonight . That ai n't over until ten . " " I 'll punch you out at ten . " Jimmy 's muddy eyes brightened at this unexpected , almost unheardoflargesse . " Really ? " " Yeah , really , really . Make like a tree and leave , Jimmy , okay ? " " Sure , " Jimmy said , thinking that for the first time in the five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble remembering which it was , although his mother kept track of it , the same as she kept track of all his tax papers ) , the old grouch had gotten the Christmas spirit . Justp280like in that movie about the three ghosts . Summoning up his own Christmas spirit , Jimmy cried : " That 's a big ten-four , good buddy ! " Will winced and lumbered into his office . He turned on the Mr. Coffee and sat down behind his desk , watching as Jimmy put away his broom , turned out most of the overhead fluorescents , and got his heavy coat . Will leaned back and thought . It was , after all , his brains that had kept him alive all these years , alive and one step ahead ; he had never been handsome , he had been fat all of his adult life , and his health had always been terrible . A childhoodbout of scarletina one spring had been followed by a mild case of polio ; he had been left with a right arm that operated at only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plague of boils . When Will was forty-three his doctor had discovered a large , spongy growth under one arm . It had turned out to be nonmalignant , but the removal surgery had kept him on his back most of one summer , and as a result he had developed bedsores . A year later he had almost died of double pneumonia . Now it was incipient diabetes and emphysema . But his brains had always been fine and dandy , and his brains kept him one step ahead . So he leaned back and thought about Arnie . He supposed one of the things that had favorably impressed him about Cunningham after he had stood up to Repperton that day was a certain similarity to the longagoteenaged Will Darnell . Of course , Cunningham was n't sickly , but he had been pimply , disliked , a loner . Those things had all been true of the young Will Darnell . Cunningham had brains , too . Brains and that car . That strange car . " Good night , Mr. Darnell , " Jimmy called . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainly , " Merry Christmas . " Will raised his hand in a wave . Jimmy left . Will heaved his bulk out of his chair , got the bottle of Courvoisier out of the filing cabinet , and set it down next to the Mr. Coffee . Then he sat down again . A rough chronology was ticking through his mind . August : Cunningham brings in an old wreck of a ' 58 Plymouth and parks it in stall twenty . It looks familiar , and it should . It 's Rollie LeBay 's Plymouth . And Arnie does n't know it  --  he has no need to know it  --  but once upon a time Rollie LeBay also made an occasional run to Albany or Burlington or Portsmouth for Will Darnell . . . only in those dim dead days , Will had a ' 54 Cadillac . Different transport cars , same false-bottom trunk with the hidden compartment for fireworks , ciga/rettes , booze , and pot . In those days Will had never heard of cocaine . He supposed no one but jazz musicians in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , and Darnell kicks Repperton out . He 's tired of Repperton , the constant braggadocio , the cock-of-the-walk manner . He 's hurting custom , and while he 'll make all the runs into New York and New England that Will wants , he 's careless , and carelessness is dangerous . He has a tendency to exceed the double-nickel speed limit , he 's gotten speeding tickets . All it would take is one nosy cop to put them all in court . Damell is n't afraid of going to jail  --  not in Libertyville  --  but it would look bad . There was a time when he did n't care much how things looked , but he 's older now . Will got up , poured coffee , and tipped in a capful of brandy . He paused , thought it over , and tipped in a second capful . He sat down , took a cigar out of his breast pocket , looked at it , and lit it . Fuck you , emphysema . Take this . Fragrant smoke rising around him , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into his shadowy , silent garage and thought some more . September : The kid asks him to jump an inspection sticker and loan him a dealer plate so he can take his girl to a football game . Darnell does it  --  hell , there was a day when he used to sell an inspection sticker for seven dollars and never even look at the car it was going on . Besides , the kid 's car is looking good . A little rough , maybe , and it 's still more than a little noisy , but all in all , pretty damn good . He 's doing a real job of restoration . And that 's pretty damn strange , is n't it , when you consider that no one has ever seen him really work on it . Oh , little things , sure . Replacing bulbs in the parking lights . Changingtires . The kid is no dummy about cars : Will sat right in this chair one day and watched him replace the upholstery in the back seat . But no one has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was totallyshot when he wheeled the ' 58 in here for the first time late last summer . And no one has seen him doing any bodywork , either , although the Fury 's bod , which had an advanced case of cancer when the kid brought it in , now looks cherry . Darnell knew what Jimmy Sykes thought , because he had asked him once . Jimmy thought Arnie did the serious work at night , after everyone was gone . " That 's one hell of a lot of night work , " Darnell said aloud , and felt a sudden chill that not even the brandy-laced coffee could dispel . A lotp282of night work , yeah . It must have been . Because what the kid seemed to be doing days was listening to the greaser music on WDIL . That , and a lot of aimless fooling around . " I guess he does the big stuff at night , " Jimmy had said , with all the guileless faith of a child explaining how Santa Claus gets down the chimney or how the tooth fairy put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either Santa Claus or the tooth fairy , and he did n't he lieve that Arnie had restored Christine at night , either . Two other facts rolled around uneasily in his mind like pool ball : looking for a pocket in which to come to rest . He knew that Cunningham had been driving the car around out back a lot before it was street-legal , that was one thing . Just cruising slowly up and down the narrow lanes between the thousands of junked cars in the block-long back lot . Driving at five miles an hour , around and around after dark , after everyone had gone home , circling the big crane with the round electromagnet and the great box of the car-crusher . Cruising . The one time Darnell asked him about it , Arnie had told him he was checking out a shimmy in the front end . But the kid could n't lie for shit . No one ever checked out a shimmy at five miles an hour . That was what Cunningham did after everyone else went home . That had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in and out of the junkers , headlights flickering unsteadily in their rust-eaten sockets . Then there was the Plymouth 's odometer . It ran backward . Cunninghamhad pointed that out to him with a sly little smile . It ran backwardat an extremely fast rate . He told Will that he figured the odomo ter turned back five miles or so for every actual mile travelled . Will had been frankly amazed . He had heard of setting odometers back in the used-car business , and he had done a good bit of it himself ( along with stuffing transmissions full of sawdust to stifle their death whines and pouring boxes of oatmeal into terminally ill radiators to temporarily plug their leaks ) , but he had never seen one that ran backward spontaneously . He would have thought it impossible . Arnie had just smiled a funny little smile and called it a glitch . It was a glitch , all right , Will thought . One hell of a glitch . The two thoughts clicked lazily off each other and rolled in different directions . Boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fixed it up like magic . Will did n't believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy , but he was pe fectly willing to acknowledge that there were strange things in the world . A practical man recognized that and put it to use if he could . A friend of Will 's who lived in Los Angeles claimed he had seen the ghostof his wife before the big quake of ' 67 , and Will had no particularreason to doubt the claim ( although he would have doubted it completelyif the friend had had anything to gain ) . Quent Youngerman , another friend , had claimed to have seen his father , long dead , standing at the foot of his hospital bed after Quent , a steel-worker , had taken a terrible fall from the fourth floor of a building under construction down on Wood Street . Will had heard such stories off and on all his life , as most people undoubtedlydid . And as most thinking people probably did , he put them in a kind of open file , neither believing nor disbelieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them in that open file because no one knew where people came from when they were born and no one knew where people went when they died , and not all the Unitarian ministers and born-again Jesus-shouters and Popes and Scientologists in the world could convince Will otherwise . Just because some people went crazy on the subject did n't mean they knew anything . He put stuff like that in that open file because nothing really inexplicable had ever happened to him . Except maybe something like that was happening now . November : Repperton and his good buddies beat the living shit out of Cunningham 's car at the airport . When it comes in on the tow-truck , it looks like the Green Giant shat all over it . Darnell looks at it and thinks , It 's never gon na run again . That 's all ; it 's never gon na run anotherfoot . At the end of the month the Welch kid gets killed on JFK Drive . December : A State Police detective comes sucking around . Junkins . He comes sucking around one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on a day when Cunningham is n't here and wants to know how come the kid is lying about how much damage Repperton and his dogturd friends ( of whom the late and unlamented Peter " Moochie " Welch was one ) did to Cunningham 's Plymouth . Why you talking to me ? Darnell asks him , wheezing and coughing through a cloud of cigar smoke . Talk to him , it 's his fucking Plymouth , not mine . I just run this place so working foes can keep their cars running and keep putting food on the table for their families . Junkins listens patiently to this rap . He knows Will Darnell is doing a hell of a lot more than just running a do-it-yourself garage and a junkyard , but Darnell knows he knows , so that 's okay . Junkins lights a cigarette and says , I 'm talking to you because I alreadytalked to the kid and he wo n't tell me . For a little while there Ip284thought he wanted to tell me ; I got the feeling he 's scared green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me squat . Darnell says , If you think Arnie ran down that Welch kid , say so . Junkins says , I do n't . His parents say he was home asleep , and it does n't feel like they 're lying to cover up for him . But Welch was one of the guys that trashed his car , we 're pretty sure of that , and I 'm positive he 's lying about how bad they trashed it and I do n't know why and it 's driving me crazy . Too bad , Darnell says with no sympathy at all . Junkins asks , How bad was it , Mr. Darnell ? You tell me . And Darnell tells his first and only lie during the interview with Junkins : I really did n't notice . He noticed , all right , and he knows why Arnie is lying about it , trying to minimize it , and this cop would know why too , if it was n't so obvious he was walking all over it instead of seeing it . Cunningham is lying becausethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state gumshoe can imagine , those hoods did n't just beat up on Cunningham 's ' 58 , they killed it . Cunningham is lying because , although nobody saw him do much of anything during the week after the towtruckbrought Christine back to stall twenty , the car was basically as good as new  --  even better than it had been before . Cunningham lied to the cop because the truth was incredible . " Incredible , " Darnell said out loud , and drank the rest of his coffee . He looked down at the telephone , reached for it , and then drew his hand back . He had a call to make , but it might be better to finish thinkingthis through first  --  have all his ducks in a row . He himself was the only one ( other than Cunningham himself ) who could appreciate the incredibility of what had happened : the car 's complete and total regeneration . Jimmy was too soft in the attic , and the other guys were in and out , not regular custom at all . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done ; a lot of the guys who had been doing repairs on their rolling iron during that week in November had used the word incredible , and several of them . had looked uneasy . Johnny Pomberton , who bought and sold used trucks , had been trying to get an old dumpster he 'd picked up in runningshape that week . Johnny knew cars and trucks better than anyone else in Libertyville , maybe anyone else in all of Pennsylvania . He told Will frankly and fiat-out that he could n't believe it . It 's like voodoo , Johnny Pomberton had said , and then uttered a laugh without much humor . Will only sat there looking politely interested , and after a secondor two the old man shook his head and went away.  |p285Sitting  in his office and looking out at the garage , eerily silent in the slack time that came every year in the weeks before Christmas , Will thought ( not for the first time ) that most people would accept anything if they saw it happen right before their very eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no abnormal ; what happened , happened , and that was the end . Jimmy Sykes : Like magic . Junkins : He 's lying about it , but I 'll be goddamned if I know why . Will pulled open his desk drawer , denting his paunch , and found his note-minder book for 1978 . He paged through it and found his own scrawled entry : Cunningham . Chess tourney . Philly Sheraton Dec. 11-13 . He called Directory Assistance , got the number of the hotel , and made the call . He was not too surprised to feel his heartbeat shifting into a higher gear as the phone rang and the desk clerk picked it up . Like magic . " Hello , Philadelphia Sheraton . " " Hello , " Will said . " You have a chess tournament put up there , I th  --  " " Northern States , yessir , " the desk clerk broke in . He sounded quick and almost insufferably young . " I 'm calling from Libertyville , Pee-Ay , " Will said . " I believe you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the chess tourney kids . I 'd like to speak to him , if he 's in . " " Just a moment , sir , I 'll see . " Clunk . Will was put on hold . He cocked himself back in his swivel chair and sat that way for what seemed to be a very long time , although the red second-hand on the office clock only revolved once . He wo n't be there , and if he is , I 'll eat my " Hello ? " The voice was young , warily curious , and unmistakably Cunningham 's . Will Darnell felt a peculiar lift drop in his belly , but none of it showed in his voice ; he was much too old for that . " Hi , Cunningham , " he said . " Darnell . " " Will ? " " Yeah . " " What are you up to , Will ? " " How you doing , kid ? " " Won yesterday and drew today . Bullshit game . Could n't seem to keep my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Cunningham  --  him without a doubt . Will , who would no more call someone without a cover story than he would go out without his skivvies on , said smoothly , " You got a pencil , kiddo ? " " Sure . " " There 's an outfit on North Broad Street , United Auto Parts . You think you could go by there and see what they 've got for tires ? " " Retreads ? " Arnie asked . " First-lines . " " Sure , I can go by . I 'm free tomorrow afternoon from noon until three . " " That 'll be fine . You ask for Roy Mustungerra , and mention my name . " " Spell that . " Will spelled it . " That 's all ? " " Yeah . . except I hope you get your ass whupped . " " Fat chance , " Cunningham said , and laughed . Will told him goodbye and hung up . It was Cunningham , no doubt about that . Cunningham was in Philadelphiatonight , and Philadelphia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an extra set of keys to ? The Guilder kid . Sure ! Except the Guilder kid was in the hospital . His girl . But she did n't have a driver 's license or even a permit . Arnie had said so . Someone else . There was no one else . Cunningham was n't close to anyone else except for Will himself , and Will knew damned well Cunningham had never given him a dupe set of keys . Like magic . Shit . Will leaned back in his chair again and lit another cigar . When it was going and the neatly clipped-off end was in his ashtray , he looked up at the raftering smoke and thought it over . Nothing came . Cunningham was in Philly and he had gone on the high school bus , but his car was gone . Jimmy Sykes had seen it pulling out , but Jimmy had n't seen who was driving it . Now just what did all of that mean ? What did it add up to ? Gradually , his mind turned into other channels . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the lead part in the senior play . His part had been that of the minister who is driven to suicide by his lust for Sadie Thompson , the girl he has set out to save . He had brought down the house . His one moment of glory in a high school career that had been devoid of sporting or academic triumphs , and maybe the high point of his youth  --  his father had been a drunk , his mother a drudge , his one brother a deadbeat with his own moment of glory coming somewhere in Germany , his only applause the steady pounding of German 88s . He thought of his one girlfriend , a pallid blonde named Wanda Haskins , whose white cheeks had been splattered with freckles which grew painfully profuse in the August sun . They almost surely would have been married  --  Wanda was one of four girls that Will Darnell had actuallyfucked ( he excluded whores from his count ) . She was surely the only one he had ever loved ( always assuming there was such a thing  --  and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never witnessed , he could doubt its existence but not disprove it ) , but her father had been in the Army , and Wanda had been an Army brat . At the age of fifteen  --  perhaps only a year before the mystic shift in the balance of power from the hands of the old into those of the young  --  she and her family had moved to Wichita , and that had been the end of that . There was a certain lipstick she had worn , and in that long-ago summerof 1934 it had tasted like fresh raspberries to a Will Darnell who was still quite slim and clear-eyed and ambitious and young . It had been a taste to make the left hand stray to the erect and enthusiastic root of the penis in the middle of the night . . and even before Wanda Haskins consented , they had danced that sweet and special dance in Will Darnell 's dreams . In his narrow child 's bed that was too short for his growing legs , they had danced . And , now thinking of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , ceasing to dream , began to dance again . He awakened from a sleep that had never really deepened solidly some three hours later ; he awoke to the sound of the big garage door rattling up and the inside light over the door  --  no fluorescent but a blaring200-watt bulb  --  coming on . Will tilted his chair back down in a hurry . His shoes hit the mat under his desk ( BARDAHL written across it in raised rubber letters ) , and it was the shock of pins and needles in his feet more than anything else that brought him awake.  |p288Christine  moved slowly across the garage toward stall twenty and slipped in . Will , hardly convinced even now that he was awake , watched her with a curious lack of excitement which perhaps only belongs to those summoned directly from their dreams . He sat upright behind his desk , hamlike arms planted on his dirty , doodled-upon blotter , and watched her . The engine raced once , twice . The bright new exhaust pipe shot blue smoke . Then the motor shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was shut , but there was an intercom , always on , between the office and the long , barnlike garage area . It was the same intercom on which he had heard the beginnings of the Cunningham-Repperton title fight back in August . From the intercom 's speaker he now heard the steady tick of metal as the engine cooled . He heard nothing else . No one got out of Christine , because there was no one in her to get out . He put stuff like that in an open file because nothing really inexplicablehad ever happened to him . . . except maybe something like that was happening now . He had seen her cross the cement to stall twenty , the automatic door rattling shut against the cold December night behind her . And experts , examining the case later , could say : The witness had dozed and then fallen asleep , he admits that much , and that he was dreaming . . . what he claims to have seen was obviously nothing more or less than an extension of that dream , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery . . . . Yes , they could say that , just as Will could dream of dancing with fifteen-year-old Wanda Haskins . . . but the reality was a hard-headed man of sixty-one , a man who had long since jettisoned any last romanticnotions . And he had seen Cunningham 's ' 58 glide across the garage empty , the steering wheel moving all by itself as the car slipped into her accustomedstall . He had seen the headlights go off , and he had heard the eight-cylinder engine as it died . Now , feeling oddly boneless , Will Darnell got up , hesitated , went to the door of his office , hesitated again , and then opened it . He walked out and moved down the ranks of slant-parked cars to stall twenty . His footfalls echoed behind him and then died out in a mystery . He stood beside the car with her rich two-tone body , red and white.  |p289The  paintjob was deep and clear and perfect , unmarred by the smallest chip or the slightest touch of rust . The glass was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nick caused by a random-flying pebble . The only sound now was the slow drip of melting snow from the front and rear bumpers . Will touched the hood . It was warm . He tried the driver 's side door , and it opened freely . The smell that issued forth was the warm smell of new leather , new plastic , new chrome  --  except that there seemed to be another , more unpleasant smell beneath it . An earthy smell . Will breathed deep but could not place it . He thought briefly of old turnips in his father 's basement vegetable bin , and his nose wrinkled . He leaned in . There were no keys in the ignition . The odometer read 52,107.8 . Suddenly , the empty ignition slot set into the dashboard revolved , the black slit heeling over of its own accord past ACC to START . The hot enginecaught at once and rumbled steadily , full of contented high-octane power . Will 's heart staggered in his chest . His breath caught . Gasping and whooping noisily for breath , he hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his desk drawers . His breath , thin and impotent , sounded like winter wind under an entryway door . His face was the color of old candlewax . His fingers caught in the loose flesh of his throat and pulled restlessly . Christine 's engine turned off again . No sound now but the tick and click of cooling metal . Will found his aspirator , plunged it deep into his throat , depressed the trigger , and inhaled . Little by little , the feeling that a wheelbarrowfulof cinderblocks was sitting on his chest dissipated . He sat down in the swivel chair and listened gratefully to the sane and expectedcreak of protest from its springs . He covered his face momentarilywith his fat hands . Nothing really inexplicable . . . until now . He had seen it . Nothing had been driving that car . It had come in empty , smelling of something like rotting turnips . And even then , in spite of his dread , Will 's mind began to turn and he began wondering how he could put what he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow convertible , Four-door DeVille , With a Continental spare and wire-chrome wheels . I want power steering , And power brakes ; I want a powerful motor with a jet of/takeI want shortwave radio , I want TV and a phone , You know I got ta talk to my babyWhen I 'm ridin along.  --  Chuck BerryThe burned-out wreck of Buddy Repperton 's Camaro was found late on Wednesday afternoon by a park ranger . An old lady who lived with her husband in the tiny town of Upper Squantic had called the ranger station on the lake side of the park . She was badly afflicted with arthritis , and sometimes she could n't sleep . Last night she thought she had seen flames coming from near the park 's south gate . At what time ? She reckoned it to be around quarter past ten , because she had been watchingthe Tuesday Night Movie on CBS and it had n't been but half over . On Thursday , a news photo of the burned car appeared on the front page of the Libertyville Keystone , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HILLS STATE PARK . A State Policesource was quoted as saying " liquor was probably a factor "  --  an officially opaque way of saying that the shattered remains of over half a dozen bottles of a juice-and-wine combination sold under the trade name Texas Driver had been found in the wreckage . The news struck particularly hard at Libertyville High School ; the young always have the greatest difficulty accepting unpleasant intelligenceof their own mortality . Perhaps the holiday season made it that much harder . Arnie Cunningham found himself terribly depressed by the news . Depressedand frightened . First Moochie ; now Buddy , Richie Trelawney , and Bobby Stanton . Bobby Stanton , a dipshit little freshman Arnie had never even heard of  --  what had a dipshit little kid like that been doingp291with the likes of Buddy Repperton and Richie Trelawney anyway ? Did n't he know that was like going into a den of tigers with nothing for protection but a squirt gun ? He found it unaccountably hard to accept the grapevine version , which was simply that Buddy and his friends had gotten pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruising and drinking , and had come to a bad end . He could n't quite lose the feeling that he was somehow involved . Leigh had stopped talking to him since the argument . Arnie did n't call her  --  partly out of pride , partly out of shame , partly out of a wish that she would call him first and things could go back to what they had been ... before . Before what ? his mind whispered . Well , before she almost choked to death in your car , for one thing . Before you tried to punch out the guy who saved her life . But she wanted him to sell Christine . And that was simply impossible ... was n't it ? How could he do that after he had put so much time and effort and blood and  --  yes , it was true  --  even tears into it ? It was an old rap , and he did n't want to think about it . The final bell rang on that seemingly endless Thursday , and he went out to the studentparking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine . He sat there behind the wheel and drew a long , shuddering breath , watching the first snowflakes of an afternoon flurry twist and skirl across the bright hood . He dug for his keys , pulled them out of his pocket , and started Christine up . The motor hummed confidently and he pulled out , tires rolling and crunching over the packed snow . He would have to put snow tires on eventually , he supposed , but the truth was , Christine did n't seem to need them . She had the best traction of any car he had ever driven . He felt for the radio knob and turned on WDIL . Sheb Wooley was singing " The Purple People Eater . " That raised a smile on his face at last . Just being behind Christine 's wheel , in control , made everything seem better . It made everything seem manageable . Hearing about Repperton and Trelawney and the little shitter stepping out that way had been a terrible shock , naturally , and after the hard feelings of the late summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel a little guilty . But the simple truth was , he had been in Philly . He had n't had anything to do with it ; it was impossible . He had just been feeling low about things in general . Dennis was in the hospital . Leigh was behaving stupidly  --  as if his car had grown handsp292and jammed that piece of hamburger down her throat , for Christ 's sake . And he had quit the chess club today . Maybe the worst part of that had been the way Mr. Slawson , the facultyadvisor , had accepted his decision without even trying to change his mind . Arnie had given him a lot of guff about how little time he had these days , and how he was simply going to have to cut back on some of his activities , and Mr. Slawson had simply nodded and said , Okay , Arnie , we 'll be right here in Room 30 if you change your mind . Mr. Slawson had looked at him with his faded blue eyes that his thick glasses magnified to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in them  --  was it reproach ? Maybe it had been . But the guy had n't even tried to persuade him to stay , that was the thing . He should have at least tried , because Arnie was the best the LHS chess club had to offer , and Slawson knew it . If he had tried , maybe Arnie would have changed his mind . The truth was , he did have a little more time now that Christine was . . . was . . . What ? . . . well , fixed up again . If Mr. Slawson had said something like Hey Arnie , do n't be so rash , let 's think this over , we could really use you . . . if Mr. Slawson had said something like that , why , he might have reconsidered . But not Slawson . Just we 'll be right here in Room 30 if you change your mind , and blah-blah and yak-yak , what a fucking shitter , just like the rest of them . It was n't his fault that LHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won four games before that and would have won in the finals if he had gotten a chance . It was those two shitters Barry Qualson and Mike Hicks that had lost it for them ; both of them played chess as if maybe they thought Ruy Lopez was some new kind of soft drink or something . .. . He stripped the wrapper and the foil from a stick of gum , folded the gum into his mouth , balled the wrapper , and flicked it into the litterbag hanging from Christine 's ashtray with neat accuracy . " Right up the little tramp 's ass , " he muttered , and then grinned . It was a hard , spitless grin . Above it , his eyes moved restlessly from side to side , looking mistrustfullyout at a world full of crazy drivers and stupid pedestrians and generalidiocy . Arnie cruised aimlessly around Libertyville , his thoughts continuing to run on in this softly paranoid and bitterly comforting fashion . The radio spilled out a steady flood of golden oldies , and today all of them seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weekend , " " Telstar , " Sandy Nelson 's jungle-driven " Teen Beat , " and " Rumble " by Line Wray , the greatest of them all . His back nagged , but in a low key.  |p293The  flurry intensified briefly to a dark gray cloud of snow . He popped on his headlights , and just as quickly the snow tapered off and theclouds broke , spilling through bars of remote and coldly beautiful lateafternoonwinter sun . He cruised . He came out of his thoughts  --  which now were that Repperton had maybe come to a perfectly fitting end after all  --  and was shocked to realize that it was nearly quarter of six , and dark . Gino 's Pizza was coming up on the left , the little green neon shamrocks shimmering in the dark . Arnie pulled over to the curb and got out . He started to cross the street , then realized he had left his keys in Christine 's ignition . He leaned in to get them . . . and suddenly the smell assaulted him , the smell Leigh had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here now , as if it had come out when he left the car  --  a high , rotten , meaty smell that made his eyes water and his throat close . He snatched the keys and stood back , trembling , looking at Christine with something like horror . Arnie , there was a smell . A horrible , rotten smell . . . you know what I 'm talking about . No , I do n't have the slightest idea . . . you 're imagining things . But if she was , so was he . Arnie turned suddenly and ran across the street to Gino 's as if the devil was on his tail . Inside , he ordered a pizza he did n't really want , changed some quartersfor dimes , and slipped into the telephone booth beside the juke . It was thumping some current tune Arnie had never heard before . He called home first . His father answered , his voice oddly toneless  --  Arnie had never heard Michael 's voice quite that way before , and his unease deepened . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening were taking on the maroon tones of nightmare . Beyond the glass walls of the booth , strange faces drifted dreamily past , like untethered balloons on which someone had crudely drawn human faces . God at work with a Magic Marker . Shitters , he thought disjointedly . All a bunch of shitters . " Hello , Dad , " he said uncertainly . " Look , I  --  uh , I kind of lost track of the time here . I 'm sorry . " " That 's all right , " Michael said . His voice was almost a drone , and Arnie felt his unease deepen into something like fright . " Where are you , the garage ? "  | " No  --  uh , Gino 's . Gino 's Pizza . Dad , are you okay ? You sound funny . " " I 'm fine , " Michael said . " Just scraped your dinner down the garbage disposal , your mother 's upstairs crying again , and you 're having a pizza . I 'm fine . Enjoying your car , Arnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out . " Dad , " he managed finally , " I do n't think that 's very fair . " " I do n't think I 'm very interested anymore in what you think is fair and what you do n't think is fair , " Michael said . " You had some justification for your behavior at first , perhaps . But in the last month or so you 've turned into someone I do n't understand at all , and something is going on that I understand even less . Your mother does n't understand it either , but she senses it , and it 's hurting her very badly . I know she brought part of the hurt on herself , but I doubt if that changes the qualityof the pain . " " Dad , I just lost track of the time ! " Arnie cried . " Stop making such a big thing out of it ! " " Were you driving around ? " " Yes , but  --  " " I notice that 's when it usually happens , " Michael said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , early , " Arnie said . He wet his lips .. " I just want to go by the garage , I have some information Will asked me to get while I was in Philly  --  " " I 'm not very interested in that either , pardon me , " Michael said . His voice was still polite , chillingly disconnected . " Oh , " Arnie said in a very small voice . He was very scared now , almosttrembling . " Arnie ? " " What ? " Arnie nearly whispered . " What is going on ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " Please . That detective came by to see me at my office . He was after Regina , as well . He upset her very badly . I do n't think he meant to , but  --  " " What was it this time ? " Arnie asked fiercely . " That fucker , what was it this time ? I'll --  " " You 'll what ? " " Nothing . " He swallowed something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this time ? "  | " Repperton , " his father said . " Repperton and those other two boys . What did you think it was ? The geopolitical situation in Brazil ? " " What happened to Repperton was an accident , " Arnie said . " Why did he want to talk to you and Mom about something that was an accident , for Christ 's sake ? " " I do n't know . " Michael Cunningham paused . " Do you ? " " How would I ? " Arnie yelled . " I was in Philadelphia , how would I know anything about it ? I was playing chess , not . . . not . . . not anything else , " he finished lamely . " One more time , " Michael Cunningham said . " Is something going on , Arnie ? " He thought of the smell , the high , rotting stink . Leigh choking , diggingat her throat , turning blue . He had tried to thump her on the back because that 's what you did when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heimlich Maneuver because it had n't been invented yet , and besides , this was how it was supposed to end , only not in the car .. . beside the road ... in his arms ... . He closed his eyes and the whole world seemed to tilt and swirl sickly . " Arnie ? " " There is nothing going on , " he said through clenched teeth and without opening his eyes . " Nothing but a lot of people who are on my case because I finally got something of my own and did it all by my-self . " " All right , " his father said , his lackluster voice once more terribly reminiscent of Mr. Slawson 's . " If you want to talk about it , I 'm here . I always have been , although I did n't always make that as clear as I should have . Be sure to kiss your mother when you come in , Arnie . " " Yeah , I will . Listen , Mi  --  " Click . He stood in the booth , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was gone . There was n't even a dial tone because it was a dumb . . . fucking . . . phone booth . He dug into his pocket and spread his change out on the little metal shelf where he could look at it . He picked up a dime , almost dropped it , and at last got it into the slot . He felt sick and overheated . He felt as if he had been very efficiently disowned . He dialled Leigh 's number from memory . Mrs. Cabot picked the phone up and recognized his voice immediately . Her pleasant and rather sexy **41;10984;TOOLONG phone voice became instantly hard . Arnie had had his last chance with her , that voice said , and he had blown it . " She does n't want to talk to you and she does n't want to see you , " she said . " Mrs. Cabot , please , if I could just  --  " " I think you 've done enough , " Mrs. Cabot said coolly . " She came in crying the other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had some sort of a . . . an experience with you the last time you and she went out , and I only pray it was n't what I thought it was . I  --  " Arnie felt hysterical laughter bubbling up inside him . Leigh had almostchoked to death on a hamburger , and her mother was afraid Arnie had tried to rape her . " Mrs. Cabot , I have to talk to her . " " I 'm afraid not . " He tried to think of something else to say , some way to get past the dragon at the gate . He felt a little like a Fuller Brush salesman trying to get in to see the lady of the house . His tongue would n't move . He would have made a lousy salesman . There was going to be that hard click and then smooth silence again . Then he heard the telephone change hands . Mrs. Cabot said something in sharp protest , and Leigh said something back ; it was too muffled for him to catch . Then Leigh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Leigh , I just wanted to call and tell you how sorry I was about  --  " " Yes , " Leigh said . " I know you were , and I accept your apology , Arnie . But I wo n't  --  I ca n't go out with you anymore . Unless things change . " " Ask me something easy , " he whispered . " That 's all I  --  " Her voice sharpened , moved slightly away from the telephone . " Mom , please stop hanging over me ! " Her mother said something that sounded disgruntled , there was a pause , and then Leigh 's voice again , low . " That 's all I can say , Arnie . I know how crazy it sounds , but I still think your car tried to kill me the other night . I do n't know how something like that could be , but no matter how I work it over in my mind , it comes out seeming that that was how it was . I know that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Leigh , if you 'll pardon my French , that 's pretty fucking stupid . It 's a car ! Can you spell that ? C - A- R , car ! There 's nothing  --  " " Yes , " she said , and now her voice was wavering toward tears . " It 's got you , she 's got you , and I guess nobody can get you free except you. , ,  |p297His  back suddenly awoke and began to throb , sending pain out in a sickish radiation that seemed to echo and amplify in his head . " Is n't that the truth of it , Arnie ? " He did n't , could n't , answer . " Get rid of it , " Leigh said . " Please . I read about that Repperton boy in the paper this morning , and  --  " " What 's that got to do with anything ? " Arnie croaked . And for the second time : " That was an accident . " " I do n't know what it was . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't us I 'm worried about anymore . It 's you , Arnie . I 'm scared for you . You ought to  --  no , you have to get rid of it . " Arnie whispered , " Just say you wo n't dump me , Leigh . Okay ? " Now she was even closer to crying  --  or perhaps she was already doing it . " Promise me , Arnie . You have to promise me and then you have to do it . Then we . . . we can see . Promise me you 'll get rid of that car . It 's all I want from you , nothing else . " He closed his eyes and saw Leigh walking home from school . And ablock down , idling at the curb , was Christine . Waiting for her . He opened his eyes quickly , as if he had seen a fiend in a dark room . " I ca n't do that , " he said . " Then we do n't have much to talk about , do we ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Goodbye , Arnie . I 'll see you in school . " " Leigh , wait ! " Click . And dead smooth silence . A moment of nearly total rage came over him . He had a sudden deadly impulse to swing the black phone receiver around and around his head like an Argentinian bolas , shattering the glass in this goddam torture-chamber of a telephone booth . They had run out on him , all of them . Rats deserting a sinking ship . You have to be ready to help yourself before anyone else can help you . Fuck that bullshit ! They were rats deserting a sinking ship . Not one of them , from that shitter Slawson with his thick horn-rimmed glasses and his weird poached-egg eyes to his rotten shitting old man who was so fucking pussywhipped that he ought to just give that cunt he was married to a razor and invite her to cut it off to that cheap bitch in her fancy house with her legs crossed probably she 'd been having her period and that 's why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy goddam cars and the trunks full of golf-clubs those goddam officers 1 'd like to bend them over this here lathe I 'd play somep298golf with them I could find the right hole to put those little white balls in you bet your ass but when I get out of here no one 's going to tell me what to do it 's gon na be my way my way mine mine mine mine mine MINEArnie came back to himself suddenly , scared and wide-eyed , breathing hard . What had been happening to him ? He had seemed like someoneelse there for a moment , someone on a crazed rant against humanityin generalNot just someone . It was LeBay . No ! That 's not true at all ! Leigh 's voice : Is n't that the truth of it , Arnie ? Suddenly something very like a vision rose in his tired , confused mind . He was hearing a minister 's voice : Arnold , do you take this woman to be your lovingBut it was n't a church ; it was a used-car lot with bright multicolored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been set up . It was Will Darnell 's lot , and Will was standing beside him in the best man 's position . There was no girl beside him . Christine was parked beside him , shining in a spring sun , even her whitewalls seeming to glow . His father 's voice : Is there something going on ? The preacher 's voice : Who giveth this woman to this man ? Roland D. LeBay rose from one of the camp chairs like the prow of a skeletal ghost-ship from Hades . He was grinning  --  and for the first time Arnie saw who had been sitting around him : Buddy Repperton , Richie Trelawney , Moochie Welch . Richie Trelawney was black and charred , most of his hair burned off . Blood had poured down Buddy Repperton 's chin and had caked his shirt like hideous vomit . But Moochie Welch was the worst ; Moochie Welch had been ripped open like a laundry bag . They were smiling . All of them were smiling . I do , Roland D. LeBay croaked . He grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stinking hole of his mouth . I give her , and he 's got the receipt to prove it . She 's all his . The bitch is the ace of spades . . . and she 's all his . Arnie became aware that he was moaning in the telephone booth , clutching the receiver against his chest . With a tremendous effort he pulled himself all the way out of the daze  --  vision , whatever it had been  --  and got hold of himself . This time when he reached for the change on the ledge , he spilled half of it onto the floor . He plugged a dime into the slot and scrabbledp299through the telephone book until he found the hospital number . Dennis . Dennis would be there , Dennis always had been . Dennis would n't let him down . Dennis would help . The switchboard girl answered , and Arnie said , " Room Two-forty , please . " The connection was made . The phone began to ring . It rang . .. andrang .. . and rang , Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Second floor , C Wing , who were you trying to reach ? " " Guilder , " Arnie said . " Dennis Guilder . " " Mr. Guilder 's in Physical Therapy right now , " the female voice said . " You could reach him at eight o'clock . " Arnie thought of telling her it was important  --  very important  --  but suddenly he was overwhelmed with a need to get out of the phone booth . Claustrophobia was like a giant 's hand pushing down on his chest . He could smell his own sweat . The smell was sour , bitter . " Sir ? " " Yeah , okay , I 'll call back , " Arnie said . He broke the connection and nearly burst out of the booth , leaving his change scattered on the ledge and the floor . A few people turned around to look at him , mildly interested , and then turned back to their food again . " Pizza 's ready , " the counterman said . Arnie glanced up at the clock and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was sweat all over his face . His armpits felt like a jungle . His legs were trembling  --  the muscles in his thighs felt as if they might simply give out and spill him onto the floor . He paid for the pizza , nearly dropping his wallet as he tucked his three dollars in change back in . " You okay ? " the counterman asked . " You look a little white around the gills . " " I 'm fine , " Arnie said . Now he felt as if he might vomit . He snatched the pizza in its white box with the word GINO 'S emblazoned across the top and fled into the cold sharp clarity of the night . The last of the clouds had blown away , and the stars twinkled like chipped diamonds . He stood on the sidewalk for a moment , looking first at the stars and then at Christine , parked across the street , waiting faithfully . She would never argue or complain , Arnie thought . She would never demand . You could enter her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her warmth . She would never deny . She  --  sheShe loved him . Yes ; he sensed that was true . Just as he sometimes sensed that LeBay would not have sold her to anyone else , not for two hundred and fifty ,  |p300not  for two thousand . She had been sitting there waiting for the right buyer . One who would .. . One who would love her for herself alone , that voice inside whispered . Yes . That was it ; that was exactly it . Arnie stood there with his pizza forgotten in his hands , white steam rising lazily from the grease-spotted box . He looked at Christine , and such a confusing whirl of emotions ran through him that there might have been a cyclone in his body , rearranging everything it did not simplydestroy . Oh , he loved and loathed her , he hated her and cherished her , he needed her and needed to run from her , she was his and he was hers and ( I now pronounce you man and wife joined and sealed from this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ) But worst of all was the horror , the terrible numbing horror , the realization that . . . that . . . ( how did you hurt your back that night , Arnie ? after Repperton  --  the late Clarence " Buddy " Repperton  --  and his buddies trashed her ? how did you hurt your back so that now you have to wear this stinking brace all the time ? how did you hurt your back ? ) The answer rose  --  and Arnie began to run , trying to beat the realization , to get to Christine before he saw the whole thing plain and went mad . He ran for Christine , running his tangled emotions and some terrible dawning realization a foot race ; he ran to her the way a hype runs for his works when the shakes and the jitters get so bad he can no longer think of anything but relief ; he ran the way that the damned run to their appointed doom ; he ran as a bridegroom runs to the place where his bride stands waiting . He ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , father , Leigh , Dennis , or what he had done to his back that night when everyone was gone , that night after he had taken his almost totally destroyed Plymouth from the airport and back to Darnell 's , and after the place was empty he had put Christine 's transmission in neutral and pushed her , pushed her until she began to roll on her flat tires , pushed her until she was out the door and he could hear the wind of November keening sharply around the wrecks and the abandoned hulks with their stellated glass and their ruptured gas tanks ; he had pushed her until the sweat ran off him in rivers and his heart thudded like a runaway horse in his chest and his back cried out for mercy ; he had pushed her , his body pumping as if in some hellish consummation ; hep301had pushed her , and inside the odometer ran slowly backward , and some fifty feet beyond the door his back began to really throb , and he kept pushing , and then his back began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscling it along on the flat , slashed tires , his hands going numb , his back screaming , screaming , screaming . And thenHe reached Christine and flung himself inside , shuddering and panting . His pizza fell on the floor . He picked it up and set it on the seat , feeling calm slowly wash through him like a soothing balm . He touched the steering wheel , let his hands slip down it , tracing its delicious curve . He took one glove off and felt in his pocket for his keys . For LeBay 's keys . He could still remember what had happened that night , but it did not seem horrible now ; now , sitting behind Christine 's steering wheel , it seemed rather wonderful . It had been a miracle . He remembered how it had suddenly become easier to push the car because the tires were healing themselves magically , kneading themselvestogether without a scar and then inflating . The broken glass had begun to reassemble from nowhere , knitting itself upward with small , scratchy , crystalline sounds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her until she was right enough to run , and then he had driven her , cruising between the rows until the odometer ran back past what Repperton and his friends had done . And then Christine was okay . What could be so horrible about that ? " Nothing , " a voice said . He looked around . Roland D. LeBay was sitting on the passenger side of the car , wearing a black double-breasted suit , a white shirt , a blue tie . A row of medals hung askew on one lapel of his suit-coat  --  it was the outfit he had been buried in , Arnie knew that even though he had never actually seen it . Only LeBay looked younger and tougher . A man you 'd not want to fool with . " Start her up , " LeBay said . " Get the heater going and let 's motor-vate . " " Sure , " Arnie said , and turned the key . Christine pulled out , tires crunching on the packed snow . He had pushed her that night until almostall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negated . Negated was the right word for what had happened . And then he had put her back in stall twenty , leaving the rest to do himself . " Let 's have us some music , " the voice beside him said.  |p302Arnie  turned on the radio . Dion was singing " Donna the Prima Donna . " " You going to eat that pizza , or what ? " The voice seemed to be changing somehow . " Sure , " Arnie said . " You want a piece ? " Leering : " I never say no to a piece of anything . " Arnie opened the pizza box with one hand and pulled a piece free . " Here you g  --  " His eyes widened . The slice of pizza began to tremble , the long threads of cheese dangling down beginning to sway like the strands of a spiderweb broken by the wind . It was n't LeBay sitting there anymore . It was him . It was Arnie Cunningham at roughly age fifty , not as old as LeBay had been when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that old , but getting there , friends and neighbors , getting there . His older self was wearing a slightly yellowed T-shirt and dirty , oil-smeared bluejeans . The glasses were hornrims , taped at one bow . The hair was cut short and receding . The gray eyes were muddy and bloodshot . The mouth had taken all the tucks of sour loneliness . Because this  --  this thing , apparition , whatever it was  --  it was alone . He felt that . Alone except for Christine . This version of himself and Roland D. LeBay could have been son and father : the resemblance was that great . " You going to drive ? Or are you going to stare at me ? " this thing asked , and it suddenly began to age before Arnie 's stunned eyes . The iron-colored hair went white , the T-shirt rippled and thinned , the body beneath twisted with age . The wrinkles raced across the face and then sank in like lines of acid . The eyes sank into their sockets and the corneasyellowed . Now only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some ancient carrion-eater , but still his face , oh , yes , still his . " See anything green ? " this Sept  --  no , this octogenarian Arnie Cunninghamcroaked , as its body twisted and writhed and withered on Christine 's red seat . " See anything green ? See anything green ? See anything  --  " The voice cracked and rose and whined into a shrill , senile treble , and now the skin broke open in sores and surface tumors and behind the glasses milky cataracts covered both eyes like shades being pulled down . It was rotting before his very eyes and the smell of it was what he had smelled in Christine before , what Leigh had smelled , only it was worse now , it was the high , gassy , gagging smell of high-speed decay , the smell of his own death , and Arnie began to whine as Littlep303Richard came on the radio singing " Tutti Frutti , " and now the thing 's hair was falling out in gossamer white drifts and its collarbones poked through the shiny , stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked through like grotesque white pencils . Its lips were shrivellingaway from the final surviving teeth that leaned this way and that like tombstones , it was him , it was dead , and yet it lived  --  like Christine , it lived . " See anything green ? " it gibbered . " See anything green ? " Arnie began to scream . The fenders were clickin the guard-rail posts , The guys beside me were just as white as ghosts . One says , " Slow down , I see spots , The lines in the road just look like dots . "  --  Charlie RyanArnie pulled into Darnell 's Garage about an hour later . His rider  --  if there really had been a rider  --  was long gone . The smell was gone too ; it had undoubtedly been just an illusion . If you hung around the shitters for long enough , Arnie reasoned , everything started to smell like shit . And that made them happy , of course . Will was sitting behind his desk in his glassed-in office , eating a hoagie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arnie blipped his horn and parked . It had all been some kind of dream . Simple as that . Some crazy kind of dream . Calling home , calling Leigh , trying to call Dennis and having that nurse tell him Dennis was in Physical Therapy  --  it was like being denied three times before the cock crew , or something . He had freaked a little bit . Anyone would have freaked , after the shitstorm he 'd been through since August . It was all a question of perspective , after all , was n't it ? All his life he had been one thing to people , and now he was coming out of his shell , turning into a normal everyday person with normaleveryday concerns . It was not at all surprising that people should resent this , because when someone changed ( for better or worse , for richer or poorer ) it was natural for people to get a little weird about it . It fucked up their perspective . Leigh had spoken as if she thought he was crazy , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been under strain , of course he had , but strain was a natural part of life . If Miss **25;11027;TOOLONG Cabot thought otherwise , she was in for an abysmalfucking at the hands of that all-time champion rapist , Life . She 'd probably end up taking Dexies to get out of first gear in the morning and Nembies or ' Ludes to come down at night . Ah , but he wanted her  --  even now , thinking about her , he felt a great , unaccountable , unnameable desire sweep through him like cold wind , making him squeeze Christine 's wheel fiercely in his hands . It was a hot wanting too great , too elemental , for naming . It was its own force . But he was all right now . He felt he had . . . crossed the last bridge , or something . He had come back to himself sitting in the middle of a narrow access road beyond the farthest parking-lot reaches of the Monroeville Mall  --  which meant he was roughly halfway to California . Getting out , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a snowbank , and there was melting snow sprayed across Christine 's hood . Apparently he had lost control , gone skating across the lot ( which , even with the Christmas shopping season in full swing , was mercifully empty this far out ) , and had crashed through the bank . Damn lucky he had n't been in an accident . Damn lucky . He had sat there for a while , listening to the radio and looking through the windshield at the half-moon floating overhead . Bobby Helms had come on singing " Jingle Bell Rock , " a Sound of the Season , as the deejays said , and he had smiled a little , feeling better . He could n't remember what exactly it was that he had seen ( or thought he had seen ) , and he did n't really want to . Whatever it had been , it was , the first and last time . He was quite sure of that . People had gotten him imagining things . They 'd probably be delighted if they knew . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things were going to be better all the way around . He would mend his fences at home  --  in fact , he could start tonight by watching some TV with his folks , just like in the old days . And he would win Leigh back . If she did n't like the car , no matter how weird her reasons were , fine . Maybe he would even buy another car sometime soon and tell her he had traded Christine in . He could keep Christine here , rent space . What she did n't know would n't hurt her . And Will . This was going to be hisp305last run for Will , this coming weekend . That bullshit had gone just about far enough ; he could feel it . Let Will think he was a chicken if that 's what he wanted to think . A felony rap for interstate transport of unlicensed cigarettes and alcohol would n't look all that hot on his collegeapplication , would it ? A Federal felony rap . No . Not too cool . He laughed a little . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garage he ate his pizza even though it was cold . He was ravenous . It had struck him a bit peculiar that one piece was gone  --  in fact , it made him a bit uneasy  --  but he dismissed it . He had probably eaten it during that strange blank period , or maybe even thrown it out the window . Whoo , that had been spooky . No more of that shit . And he laughed again , this time a little less shakily . Now he got out of the car , slammed the door , and started toward Will 's office to find out what he had for him to do this evening . It suddenlyoccurred to him that tomorrow was the last day of school before the Christmas vacation , and that put an extra spring in his step .. That was when the side door , the one beside the big carport door , opened and a man let himself in . It was Junkins . Again . He saw Arnie looking at him and raised a hand . " Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , Will shrugged and went on eating his hoagie . " Hello , " Arnie said . " What can I do for you ? " " Well , I do n't know , " Junkins said . He smiled , and then his eyes slid past Arnie to Christine , appraising , looking for damage . " Do you want to do something for me ? " " Not fucking likely , " Arnie said . He could feel his head starting to throb with rage again . Rudy Junkins smiled , apparently unoff ended . " I just dropped by . How you been ? " He stuck out his hand . Arnie only looked at it . Not embarrassed in the slightest , Junkins dropped his hand , walked around to Christine , and began examining her again . Arnie watched him , his lips pressed togetherso tightly they were white . He felt a fresh pulse of anger each time Junkins dropped one of his hands onto Christine . " Look , maybe you ought to buy a season ticket or something , " Arnie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and looked at him questioningly . " Never mind , " Arnie said sullenly . Junkins went on looking . " You know , " he said , " it 's a hell of a strange thing , what happened to Buddy Repperton and those other two boys , is n't it ? "  |p306Fuck  it , Arnie thought . I 'm not going to fool around with this shitter . " I was in Philadelphia . Chess tourney . " " I know , " Junkins said . " Jesus ! You 're really checking me out ! " Junkins walked back to Arnie . There was no smile on his face now . " Yes , that 's right , " he said . " I 'm checking you out . Three of the boys I believe were involved in vandalizing your car are now dead , along with a fourth boy who was apparently just along for the ride on Tuesday night . That 's a pretty big coincidence . It 's nine miles too big for me . You bet I 'm checking you out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , uncertain . " I thought it was an accident . . . that they were liquored up and speeding and  --  " " There was another car involved , " Junkins said . " How do you know that ? " " There were tracks in the snow , for one thing . Unfortunately , the wind had blurred them too much for us to be able to get a decent photo . But one of the barriers at the Squantic Hills State Park gate was broken , and we found traces of red paint on it . Buddy 's Camaro was n't red . It was blue . " He measured Arnie with his eyes . " We also found traces of red paint embedded in Moochie Welch 's skin , Arnie . Can you dig that ? Embedded . Do you know how hard a car has to hit a guy to embed paint in his skin ? " " You ought to go out there and start counting red cars , " Arnie said coldly . " You 'll be up to twenty before you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet , " Junkins said . " But we sent our samples to the FBI lab in Washington , where they have samples of every shade of paint they ever used in Detroit . We got the results back today . Any idea what they were ? Want to guess ? " Arnie 's heart was thudding dully in his chest ; there was a correspondingbeat at his temples . " Since you 're here , I 'd guess it was AutumnRed . Christine 's color . " " Give that man a Kewpie doll , " Junkins said . He lit a cigarette and looked at Arnie through the smoke . He had abandoned any pretense of good humor ; his gaze was stony . Arnie clapped his hands to his head in an exaggerated gesture of exasperation . " Autumn Red , great . Christine 's a custom job , but there were Fords from 1959 to 1963 painted Autumn Red , and Thunderbirds , and Chevrolet offered that shade from 1962 to 1964 , and . for a while in the mid-fifties you could get a Rambler painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for half a year now , I get the car books ; you ca n't do work on an old car without the books , or you 're screwed before you start . Autumn Red was a popular choice . I know it "  --  he looked at Junkins fixedly  --  " and you know it , too . Do n't you ? " Junkins said nothing ; he only went on looking at Arnie in that fixed , stony , unsettling way . Arnie had never been looked at in that way by anyone in his life , but he recognized the gaze . He supposed anyone would . It was a look of strong , frank suspicion . It scared him . A few months ago  --  even a few weeks ago  --  that was probably all it would have done . But now it made him furious as well . " You 're really reaching . Just what the hell have you got against me anyway , Mr. Junkins ? Why are you on my ass ? " Junkins laughed and walked around in a large half-circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out here and Will in his office , finishing his hoagie and licking olive oil off his hands and still watching them closely . " What have I got against you ? " he said . " How does first-degree murder sound to you , Arnie ? Does that grab you with any force ? " Arnie grew very still . " Do n't worry , " Junkins said , still walking . " No big tough cop scene . No menacing threats about going downtown  --  except in this case downtownwould be Harrisburg . No Miranda card . Everything is still fine for our hero , Arnold Cunningham . " " I do n't understand any of what you 're  --  " " You . . . understand . . . PLENTY ! " Junkins roared at him . He had stopped next to a giant yellow hulk of a truck  --  another of Johnny Pomberton 's dumpsters-in-the-making . He stared at Arnie . " Three of the kids who beat on your car are dead . Autumn Red paint samples were taken at both crime scenes , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both cases was at least in part Autumn Red . And gee whiz ! It just turns out that the car those kids trashed is mostly Autumn Red . And you stand there and push your glasses up on your nose and tell me you do n't understand what I 'm talking about . " " I was in Philadelphia when it happened , " Arnie said quietly . " Do n't you get that ? Do n't you get that at all ? " " Kiddo , " Junkins said flipping his cigarette away , " that 's the worst part of it . That 's the part that really stinks . " " I wish you 'd get out of here or put me under arrest or something . Because I 'm supposed to punch in and do some work . " " For now , " Junkins said , " talk is all I 've got . The first time  --  when Welch got killed you were supposed to be home in bed . "  | " Pretty thin , I know , " Arnie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come down on my head , I would have hired a sick friend to sit up with me . " " Oh , no  --  that was good , " Junkins said . " Your mother and father had no cause to doubt your tale . I could tell that from speaking to them . And alibis  --  the true ones  --  usually have more holes than a SalvationArmy suit . It 's when they start to look like suits of armor that I get nervous . " " Holy Jumping Jesus ! " Arnie almost screamed . " It was a fucking chess meet ! I 've been in the chess club for four years now ! " " Until today , " Junkins said , and Arnie grew still again . Junkins nodded . " Oh yeah , I talked to the club advisor . Herbert Slawson . He says that the first three years you never missed a meeting , even came to a couple with a low-grade case of the flu . You were his star player . Then , this year , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my car to work on . . . and I got a girl  --  " " He said you missed the first three tourneys , and he was pretty surprised when your name turned up on the trip sheet for the Northern States meet . He thought you 'd lost all your interest in the club . " " I told you  --  " " Yes , you did . Too busy . Cars and girls , just what makes most kids too busy . But you regained your interest long enough to go to Phillyandthen you dropped out . That strikes me as very odd . " " I ca n't see anything funny about it , " Arnie said , but his voice seemed distant , almost lost in the surf-roar of blood in his ears . " Bullshit . It looks as if you knew it was coming down and set yourselfup with an airtight alibi . " The roar in his head had even assumed the steady , wavelike beats of surf , each beat accompanied by a dull thrust of pain . He was getting a headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown eyes just go away ? None of it was true , none of it . He had n't set anything up , not an alibi , not anything . He had been as surprised as anyone else when he read in the paper what had happened . Of course he had been . There was nothing strange going on , unless it was this lunatic 's paranoia , and ( how did you hurt your back anyway , Arnie ? and by the way , do you see anything green ? do you see ) he closed his eyes and for a moment the world seemed to lurch out of its orbit and he saw that green , grinning , rotting face floating before him , saying : Start her up . Get the heater going and let 's motorvate . And while we 're at it , let 's get the shitters that wrecked our car . Let 's greasep309the little cock-knockers , kid , what do you say ? Let 's hit them so fucking hard the corpse-cutter down at city hospital will have to pull the paintchipsout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Find some doowop music on the radio and let 's cruise . Let'sHe groped back behind him , touched Christine  --  her hard , cool , teas- , suring surface  --  and things dropped back into place again . He opened his eyes . " There 's only one other thing , really , " Jenkins said , " and it 's very subjective . Nothing you could put on a report . You 're different this time , Arnie . Harder , somehow . It 's almost as if you 've put on twenty years . " Arnie laughed , and was relieved to hear it sounded quite natural . " Mr. Junkins , you 've got a screw loose . " Junkins did n't join him in his laughter . " Uh-huh . I know it . The whole thing is screwy  --  screwier than anything I 've investigated in the ten years I 've been a detective . Last time , I felt like I could reach you , Arnie . I felt you were . . . I do n't know . Lost , unhappy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel that at all . I almost feel like I 'm talking to a different person . Not a very nice one . " " I 'm done talking to you , " Arnie said abruptly , and began walking toward the office . " I want to know what happened , " Junkins called after him . " And I 'm going to find out . Believe me . " " Do me a favor and stay away from here , " Arnie said . " You 're crazy . " He let himself into the office , closed the door behind him , and noticedhis hands were n't shaking at all . The room was stuffy with the smells of cigar and olive oil and garlic . He crossed in front of Will withoutspeaking , took his time-card out of the rack , and punched in : kathud . Then he looked through the glass window and saw Junkins standing there , looking at Christine . Will said nothing . Arnie could hear the noisy engine of the big man 's respiration . A couple of minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ripped out a long belch . It sounded like a chainsaw . " Yeah . " " Repperton ? " " Yeah . He thinks I had something to do with it . " " Even though you were in Philly ? " Arnie shook his head . " He does n't even seem to care about that . " He 's a smart cop then , Will thought . He knows the facts are wrong ,  |p310and  his intuition tells him there 's something even wronger than that , so he 's gotten further with it than most cops ever would , but he could spend a million years and not get all the way to the truth . He thought of the empty car driving itself into stall twenty like some weird wind-up toy . The empty ignition slot turning over to START . The engine revving once , like a warning snarl , and then falling off . And thinking of these things , Will did not trust himself to look Arnie in the face , even though his own experience in routine deceit was nearly lifelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany if the cops are watching you . " " I do n't care if you send me to Albany or not , but you do n't have to worry about the heat . He 's the only cop I 've seen , and he 's crazy . He 's not interested in anything but two cases of hit-and-run . " Now Will 's eyes did meet Arnie 's : Arnie 's gray and distant , Will 's a faded no-color , the corneas a dim yellow ; they were the eyes of an ancienttomcat who has seen a thousand mice turned inside out . " He 's interested in you , " he said . " I 'd better send Jimmy . " " You like the way Jimmy drives , do you ? " Will looked at Arnie for a moment and then sighed . " Okay , " he said . " But if you see that cop , you back off . And if you get caught holding a bag , Cunningham , it 's your bag . Do you understand that ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some work tonight , or what ? " " There 's a ' 77 Buick in forty-nine . Pull the starter motor . Check the solenoid . If it seems okay , pull that too . " Arnie nodded and left . Will 's thoughtful eyes drifted from his retreatingback to Christine . He had no business sending him to Albany this weekend and he knew it . The kid knew it too , but he was going to push ahead anyway . He had said he 'd go , and he was now going to by-God do it . And if anything happened , the kid would stand up . Will was sure of it . There was a time when he surely would n't have done , but that time was past now . He had heard it all on the intercom . Junkins had been right . The kid was harder now . Will began to look at the kid 's ' 58 again . Arnie would be taking Will 's Chrysler to New York . While he was gone , Will would watch Christine . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats in front and back , Everything 's chrome , man , even my jack , Step on the gas , she goes Waaaaahhhh -- I 'll let you look , But do n't touch my custom machine. =The Beach BoysRudolph Junkins and Rick Mercer of the Pennsylvania State Police detective division sat drinking coffee the following afternoon in a glum little office with paint peeling from the walls . Outside , a depressing mixture of snow and sleet was falling . " I 'm pretty sure this is going to be the weekend , " Junkins said . " That Chrysler has rolled every four or five weeks for the last eight months . " " Just understand that busting Darnell and whatever bee you 've got in your bonnet about that kid are two different things . " " They 're both the same thing to me , " Junkins replied . " The kid knows something . If I get him rattled , I may find out what it is . " " You think he had an accomplice ? Someone who used his car and killed those kids while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " No , goddammit . The kid has got exactly one good friend , and he 's in the hospital . I do n't know what I think , except that the car was involved . . . and he was involved too . " Junkins put his Styrofoam coffee cup down and pointed at the man on the other side of the desk . " Once we get that place closed down , I want a six-pack of lab techniciansto go over it from stem to stern , inside and out . I want it up on a lift , I want it checked for dents , bumps , repaint ... and for blood . That 's what I really want , Rick . Just one drop of blood . " " You do n't like that kid much , do you ? " Rick asked . Junkins uttered a bewildered little laugh . " You know , the first time I kind of did . I liked him and I felt sorry for him . I felt like maybe he was covering for somebody else who had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at all . " He considered.  | " And I did n't like that car , either . The way he kept touching it every time I thought I had him on the ropes . It was spooky . " Rick said , " As long as you remember that Darnell is the guy I 've got to bust . No one in Harrisburg has the slightest interest in your kid . " " I 'll remember , " Junkins said . He picked up his coffee again and looked at Rick grimly . " Because he 's a means to the end . I 'm going to nail the person who killed those kids if it 's the last thing I ever do . " " It may not even go down this weekend , " Rick said . But it did . Two plainclothes cops from Pennsylvania 's State Felony Squad sat in the cab of a four-year-old Datsun pickup on the morning of Saturday , December 16 , watching as Will Darnell 's black Chrysler rolled out of the big door and into the street . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be sleet . It was one of those misty days when it is impossible to tell where the lowering clouds end and the actual mist begins . The Chrysler was quite properly showing its parking lights . Arnie Cunningham was a safe driver . One of the plainclothesmen lifted a walkie-talkie to his mouth and spoke into it . " He just came out in Darnell 's car . You guys stay on your toes . " They followed the Chrysler to 1-76 . When they saw Arnie get on the eastbound ramp with its Harrisburg sign , they turned up the westbound ramp , toward Ohio , and reported . They would get off 1-76 one exit down the line and return to their original position near Darnell 's Garage . " Okay , " Junkins 's voice came back , " let 's make an omelette . " Twenty minutes later , as Arnie was cruising east at a sedate and legal 50 , three cops with all the right paperwork in hand knocked on the door of William Upshaw , who lived in the very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bathrobe . From behind him came the cartoon squawks of Saturday-morning TV . " Who is it , honey ? " his wife called from the kitchen . Upshaw looked at the papers , which were court orders , and felt that he might faint . One ordered that all of Upshaw 's tax records relating to Will Darnell ( an individual ) and Will Darnell ( a corporation ) be impounded . These papers bore the signature of the Pennsylvania Attorney General and a Superior Court judge . " Who is it , hon ? " his wife asked again , and one of his kids came to look , all big eyes.  |p313U|pshaw  tried to speak and could raise only a dusty croak . It had come . He had dreamed about it , and it had finally come . The house in Sewickley had not protected him from it ; the woman he kept at a safe distance in King of Prussia had not protected him from it ; it was here : he read it in the smooth faces of these cops in their off-the-rack Anderson-Littlesuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms . He produced a second ID , proclaiming him an agent of something called the Federal Drug Control Task Force . " Our information is that you keep an office in your home , " the Federalcop said . He looked  --  what ? Twenty-six ? Thirty ? Had he ever had to worry about what you were going to do when you had three kids and a wife who liked nice things maybe a little too much ? Bill Upshaw did n't think so . When you had those things to think about , your face did n't stay that smooth . Your face only stayed that smooth when you could indulge in the luxury of grand thoughts  --  law and order , right and wrong , good guys and bad guys . He opened his mouth to answer the Federal cop 's question and producedonly another dusty croak . " Is this information correct ? " the Federal cop asked patiently . " Yes , " Bill Upshaw croaked . " And another office at 100 Frankstown Road in Monroeville ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Amber asked , and came into the hallway . She saw the three men standing on the stoop and pulled the neck of her housecoatclosed . The cartoons blared . Upshaw thought suddenly , almost with relief , It 's the end of everything . The kid who had come out to see who had come to visit so early on a Saturday morning suddenly burst into tears and fled for the safety of the SuperFriends on channel 4 .. When Rudy Junkins received the news that Upshaw had been served and that all the papers pertaining to Darnell , both at Upshaw 's Sewickleyhome and his Monroeville office , had been impounded , he led half a dozen state cops in what he supposed would have been called a raid in the old days . Even during the holiday season the garage was moderately busy on Saturday ( although it was by no means the bustling place it became on summer weekends ) , and when Junkins raised a **25;11054;TOOLONG to his lips and began to use it , perhaps two dozen heads whipped around . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new year.  | " This is the Pennsylvania State Police ! " Junkins cried into the loudhailer . The words echoed and bounced . He found , even at this instant , that his eyes were drawn to the white-over-red Plymouth sitting empty in stall twenty . He had handled half a dozen murder weapons in his time , sometimes at the scene , more frequently in the witness box , but just looking at that car made him feel cold . Gitney , the IRS man who had come along for this particular sleighride , was frowning at him to go on . None of you know what this is about . None of you . But he raised the loudhailer to his lips again . " This place of business is closed ! I repeat , this place of business is closed ! You may take your vehicles if they are in running order  --  if not , please leave quickly and quietly ! This place is closed ! " The loudhailer made an amplified click as he turned it off . He looked toward the office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unlit cigar jammed in his face . Jimmy Sykes was standing by the Coke machine , his simple face a picture of confused dismay  --  hedid n't look much different from Bill Upshaw 's kid at the moment before he burst into tears . " Do you understand your rights as I have read them to you ? " The cop in charge was Rick Mercer . Behind them , the garage was empty except for four uniformed cops , who were doing paperwork on the cars which had been impounded when the garage was closed . " Yeah , " Will said . His face was composed ; the only sign of his upset was his deepening wheeze , the fast rise and fall of his big chest under his open-throated white shirt , the way he held his aspirator constantly in one hand . " Do you have anything to say to us at this time ? " Mercer asked . " Not until my lawyer gets here . " " Your lawyer can meet us in Harrisburg , " Junkins said . Will glanced at Junkins contemptuously and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals to every door and window of the garage except for the small side door . Until the state of impound ceased , all traffic would use that door . " This is the craziest thing I ever heard of , " Will Darnell said at last . " It 'll get crazier , " Mercer said , smiling sincerely . " You 're going away for a very long time , Will . Maybe someday they 'll put you in charge of the prison motor pool . " " I know you , " Will said , looking at him . " Your name is Mercer . I knew your father well . He was the crookedest cop that ever came out of King 's County . "  |p315The  blood fell out of Rick Mercer 's face and he raised his hand . " Stop it , Rick , " Junkins said . " Sure , " Will said . " You guys have your fun . Make your jokes about the prison motor pool . I 'll be back here doing business in two weeks . And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look . " He glanced around at them , his eyes intelligent , sardonic . . . and trapped . Abruptly he raised his aspirator to his mouth and breathed in deeply . " Get this bag of shit out of here , " Mercer said . He was still white . " Are you all right ? " Junkins asked . They were sitting in an unmarkedstate Ford half an hour later . The sun had decided to come out and shone blindingly on melting snow and wet streets . Darnell 's Garage sat silent . Darnell 's records  --  and Cunningham 's street-rod Plymouth  --  were safely penned up inside . " That crack he made about my father , " Mercer said heavily . " My fathershot himself , Rudy . Blew his head off . And I always thought .. . in college I read . . . " He shrugged . " Lots of cops eat the gun . Melvin Purvis did it , you know . He was the man who got Dillinger . But you wonder . " Mercer lit a cigarette and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't know anything , " Junkins said . " The fuck he did n't , " Mercer said . He unrolled his window and threw the cigarette out . He unclipped the mike under the dash . " Home , this is Mobile Two . " " Ten-four , Mobile Two . " " What 's happening with our carrier pigeon ? " " He 's on Interstate Eighty-four , coming up on Port Jervis . " Port Jervis was the crossover point between Pennsylvania and New York . " New York is all ready ? " " Affirmative . " " You tell them again that I want him northeast of Middletown before they grab him , and his toll-ticket taken in evidence . " " Ten-four . " Mercer put the mike back and smiled thinly . " Once he crosses into New York , there 's not a question in the world about it being Federal  --  but we 've still got first dibs . Is n't that beautiful ? " Junkins did n't answer . There was nothing beautiful about it  --  from Darnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was nothing beautiful about it . Junkins was filled with a spooky feeling ofp316inevitability , a feeling that the ugly things were not ending but only just beginning to happen . He felt halfway through a dark story that might prove too terrible to finish . Except he had to finish it now , did n't he ? Yes . The terrible feeling , the terrible image persisted : that the first time he had talked to Arnie Cunningham , he had been talking to a drowning man , and the second time he had talked to him , the drowning had happened  --  andhe was talking to a corpse . The cloud cover over western New York was breaking , and Arnie 's spirits began to rise . It always felt good to get away from Libertyville , away from . . . from everything . Not even the knowledge that he had contraband in the trunk could quench that feeling of lift . And at least it was n't dope this time . Far in the back of his mind  --  hardly even acknowledged , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different and how his life would change if he just dumped the cigarettes and kept on going . If he just left the entire depressing mess behind . But of course he would n't . Leaving Christine after he had put so much into her was of course impossible . He turned up the radio and hummed along with something current . The sun , weakened by December but still trying to be bold , broke cover entirely and Arnie grinned . He was still grinning when the New York Police car pulled up beside him in the passing lane and paced him . The loudspeaker on top began to chant , " This is for the Chrysler ! Pull over , Chrysler ! Pull over ! " Arnie looked over , the grin fading from his lips . He stared into a pair of black sunglasses . Copglasses . The terror that seized him was deeper than he would have believed any emotion could be  --  and it was n't for himself . His mouth went totally dry . His mind went into a blurring overdrive . He saw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps he would have done it if he had been driving Christine ... but he was n't . He saw Will Darnell telling him that if he got caught holding a bag , it was his bag . Most of all he saw Junkins , Junkins with his sharp brown eyes , and knew this was Junkins 's doing . He wished Rudolph Junkins was dead . " Pull over , Chrysler ! I 'm not talking to hear my own voice ! Pull over right now ! " Ca n't say anything , Arnie thought incoherently as he veered over into the breakdown lane . His balls were crawling , his stomach churning madly . He could see his own eyes in the rearview , wall-eyed with fearp317behind his glasses  --  not for him , though . Not for him . Christine . He was afraid for Christine . What they might do to Christine . His panic-stricken mind spun up a kaleidoscope of jumbled images . College application forms with the words REJECTED  --  CONVICTED FELONstamped across them . Prison bars , blued steel . A judge bending down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big bull queers in a prison yard looking for fresh meat . Christine riding the conveyor into the car-crusher in the junkyard behind the garage . And then , as he stopped the Chrysler and put it in park , the State Police car pulling in behind him ( and another , appearing like magic , pulling in ahead of him ) , a thought came from nowhere , full of cold comfort : Christine can take care of herself . Another thought came as the cops got out and came toward him , one holding a search warrant in his hand . It also seemed to come from nowhere , but it reverberated in Roland D. LeBay 's raspy , old man 's tones : And she 'll take care of you , boy . All you got to do is go on believing in her and she 'll take care of you . Arnie opened the car door and got out a moment before one of the cops could open it .. " Arnold Richard Cunningham ? " one of the cops asked . " Yes , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , son , " one of the others said . " But you are in a world of hurt , all the same . " The first cop stepped forward as formally as a career Army officer . " I have a duly executed document here permitting the search of this 1966 Chrysler Imperial in the name of the People of New York State and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of the United States of America . Further  --  " " Well , that just about covers the motherfucking waterfront , does n't it ? " Arnie said . His back flared dully , and he jammed his hands against it . The cop 's eyes widened slightly at the old voice coming out of this kid , but then he went on . " Further , to seize any contraband found in the course of this search in the name of the People of New York State and of the Commonwealthof Pennsylvania and of the United States of America . " " Fine , " Arnie said . None of it seemed real . Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look , but he found he had no desire to turn from them , to hide his face , and that was something of a relief . " Give me the keys , kid , " one of the cops said.  | " Why do n't you just get them yourself , you shitter ? " Arnie said . " You 're not helping yourself , kiddo , " the cop said , but he looked startled and a little fearful all the same ; for a moment the kid 's voice had deepened and roughened and he had sounded forty years older and a pretty tough customer  --  nothing like the skinny kid he saw before him at all . He leaned in , got the keys , and three of the cops immediately headed for the trunk . They know , Arnie thought , resigned . At least this had nothing to do with Junkins 's obsession with Buddy Repperton and Moochie Welch and the others ( at least not directly , he amended cautiously ) ; this smelled like a well-planned and well-coordinated operationagainst Will 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kid , " one of the cops said , " would you like to answer some questionsor make a statement ? If you think you would , I 'll read you the Miranda right now . " " No , " Arnie said calmly . " I do n't have anything to say . " " Things could go a lot easier with you . " " That 's coercion , " Arnie said , smiling a little . " Watch out or you 'll put a big fat hole in your own case . " The cop flushed . " If you want to be an asshole , that 's your lookout . " The Chrysler trunk was open . They had pulled out the spare tire , the jack , and several boxes of small parts  --  springs , nuts , bolts , and the like . One of the cops was almost entirely in the trunk ; only his blue-graycladlegs stuck out . For a moment Arnie hoped vaguely that they would n't find the under-compartment ; then he dismissed the thought  --  it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished burned away , because all that part of him did lately was hurt . They would find it . The quicker they found it , the quicker this nasty roadside scene would end . As if some god had heard his wish and decided to grant it posthaste , the cop in the trunk called triumphantly , " Cigarettes ! " " All right , " the cop who had read the warrant said . " Close it up . " He turned to Arnie and read him the Miranda warning . " Do you understandyour rights as I have read them to you ? " " Yes , " Arnie said . " Do you want to make a statement ? " " No . " " Get in the car , son . You 're under arrest . " I 'm under arrest , Arnie thought , and almost brayed laughter , the thought was so foolish . This was all a dream and he would wake upp319soon . Under arrest . Being hustled to a State Police cruiser . People looking at himDesperate , childish tears , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His chest hitched  --  once , twice . The cop who had read him his rights touched his shoulder and Arnie shrugged it off with a kind of desperation . He felt that if he could get deep down inside himself quickly enough , he would be okay  --  but sympathymight drive him mad . " Do n't touch me ! " " You do it the way you want to do it , son , " the cop said , removing his hand . He opened the cruiser 's rear door for Arnie and handed him in . Do you cry in dreams ? Of course you could  --  had n't he read about people waking up from sad dreams with tears on their cheeks ? But , dream or no dream , he was n't going to cry . Instead he would think of Christine . Not of his mother or father , not of Leigh or Will Darnell , not of Slawson  --  all the miserable shitters who had betrayed him . He would think of Christine . Arnie closed his eyes and leaned his pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as always , thinking about Christine made things better . After a while he was able to straighten up and look out at the passing scenery and think about his position . Michael Cunningham put the telephone back into its cradle slowly  --  with infinite care  --  as if to do less might cause it to explode and spray his upstairs study with jagged black hooks of shrapnel . He sat back in the swivel chair behind his desk , on which there sat his IBM Correcting Selectric II typewriter , an ashtray with the blueand-goldlegend HORLICKS UNIVERSITY barely legible across the dirty bottom , and the manuscript of his third book , a study of the ironclads Monitor and Merrimac . He had been halfway through a page when the telephone rang . Now he flipped the paper release on the right side of the typewriter and pulled the page bonelessly out from under the roller , observingits slight curve clinically . He put it down on top of the manuscript , which was now little more than a jungle of pencilled-in corrections . Outside , a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth had given way to a frigid , clear December evening . The earlier melt had frozen tight , and his son was being held in Albany on chargesp320of what amounted to smuggling : no Mr. Cunningham it is not marijuanait is cigarettes , two hundred cartons of Winston cigarettes with no tax stamps . From downstairs he could hear the whir of Regina 's sewing machine . He would have to get up now , go to the door and open it , go down the hall to the stairs , walk down the stairs , walk into the dining room , then into the plant-lined little room that had once been a laundry but which was now a sewing room , and stand there while Regina looked up at him ( she would be wearing her half-glasses for the close work ) , and say " Regina , Arnie has been arrested by the New York State Police . " Michael attempted to begin this process by getting up from his desk chair , but the chair seemed to sense he was temporarily offguard . It swivelled and rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael had to clutch the edge of his desk to keep from falling . He slipped heavily back into the chair , heart thudding with painful rapidity in his chest . He was struck suddenly by such a complex wave of despair and sorrowthat he groaned aloud and grabbed his forehead , squeezing his temples . The old thoughts swarmed back in , as predictable as summer mosquitoes and just as maddening . Six months ago , things had been okay . Now his son was sitting in a jail cell somewhere . What were the watershed moments ? How could he , Michael , have changed things ? What was the history of it , exactly ? Where had the sickness started to creep in ? " Jesus  --  " He squeezed harder , listening to the winter-whine outside the windows . He and Arnie had put the storms on just last month . That had been a good day , had n't it ? First Arnie holding the ladder and looking up , then him down and Arnie up there , him shouting for Arnie to be careful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoes , their colors gone . Sure , it had been a good day . Even after that beastly car had come , seeming to overshadow everything in their son 's life like a fatal disease , there had been some good days . Had n't there ? " Jesus , " he said again in a weak , teary voice that he despised . Unbidden images rose behind his eyes . Colleagues looking at him sideways , maybe whispering in the faculty club . Discussions at cocktail parties in which his name bobbed uneasily up and down like a waterloggedbody . Arnie would n't be eighteen for almost two months and he supposed that meant his name could n't be printed in the paper , but everyonewould still know . Word got around . Suddenly , crazily , he saw Arnie at four , astride a red trike he andp321Regina had gotten at a rummage sale ( Arnie at four had called them " Momma 's rubbage sales " ) . The trike 's red paint was flaked with scales of rust , the tires were bald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trike to bed with him , if he could . Michael closed his eyes and saw Arnie riding up and down the sidewalk , wearing his blue corduroy jumper , his hair flopping in his eyes , and then his mind 's eye blinked or wavered or did something and the rusty rubbage-sale trike was Christine , her red paint scummed with rust , her windows milky-white with age . He gritted his teeth together . Someone looking in might have thought he was smiling crazily . He waited until he had some kind of control , and then he got up and went downstairs to tell Regina what had happened . He would tell her and she would think of what they were going to do , just as she always had ; she would steal the forward motion from him , taking whatever sorry balm that actually doing things had to give , and leave him with only sick sorrow and the knowledge that now his son was someone else . She took the keys to my Cadillac car , Jumped in my kitty and drove her far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeast storms came to Libertyville on Christmas Eve , beating its way across the upper third of the U.S. on a wide and easily predictable storm track . The day began in bright thirty-degree sunshine , but morning deejays were already cheerfully predictingdoom and gloom , urging those who had not finished their lastminuteshopping to do so by mid-afternoon . Those planning trips to the old homestead for an old-fashioned Christmas were urged to rethink their plans if the trip could not be made in four to six hours . " If you do n't want to be spending Christmas Day in the breakdown lane of I-76 somewhere between Bedford and Carlisle , I 'd leave early or not at all , " the FM-104 jock advised his listening audience ( a **28;11081;TOOLONG up . The hills were steep and the trees grew as high as the columns of the Temple of Karnak . So , it was cool in this forest , and strange . The road kept climbing upward and the hill on one side of the trail was high above , but to the other it fell away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and that was different from what I expected , and soft to the eye like pillows . I felt faint and wished to fall upon them so powerful was the spirit of those trees calling me down to them ( and I did not even know the names of the spirits ! ) . I had only been in this kind of forest for a morning , yet I felt as if I had lived here half so long as the years of my life in Egypt , and my heart never stopped beating in fear , not for a moment , as I rode through . There was no place where you could feel close to the sun . Instead of the pale gold of the desert , everything was green , and even the sky , where I could see it , looked more white to me than the blue of our sky above the Nile . How twisted were the spirits of this forest . The horses kept crying to one another . " Then we came to a place where the hill fell away on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could see the sun at last . We had climbed above the trees . The trail was now so narrow I did not know if I could take the chariot through . To the one side was a wall of rock , by the other a precipice , and the horses would not move . I had to free Mu , who was nearest to the fall , from her harness , and then tied the tail of Ta to her bridle so that Mu could walk behind . The chariot I pushed myself . In that way we proceeded , step by step , the outside wheel of the chariot hanging  --  it happened  --  over the abyss . I , at the rear , leaned all my weight to the side of the chariot that was near to the wall . You may be sure I cursed in terror whenever a rock made us stop , and I had to lift the chariot over . Before we were through , I knew why Thutmose the Third was a great King . " Yes , it was difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that other wall in the Place of Truth where we climbed up to the tomb of Usermare , nor did I want such memories , although I believe the fear in which I lived on this trip , a fear so great as to make me think of myself as another person , and a weak one  --  came from my abject silence when He took me by the hair . No matter , I was one sweating charioteer by the time the horses and I came through and reached a rise from which I could see ahead . Below , the pass widened , and there on a hill in the distance up the other side of thep301valley across green forests and plowed fields was the town of Megiddo . I saw it through the battlement of the mountains . " Thutmose the Third had descended this pass , and gone into battle , and captured chariots of gold and silver and left the championsof the enemy stretched out like fish '  --  such was the word of Ramses . Thutmose took thousands of cattle and two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunder I had supposed the city would be a rich sight with white marble palaces like our own Memphi , or temples of gold , or , at the least , wooden mansions painted in the richest of colors . Yet , on the next day , as I came near , it was only a poor town , and dirty in appearance . Maybe it had been poor ever since Thutmose had conquered it . All the same , it was a fort , the first Syrian fort I had seen , and it was not built square like ours with our straight brick walls . These palisades were made of rough stone , and went up and down with the land , the walls following the hills . Every few hundred steps was a high tower so that you could not charge the doors of Megiddo without a hundred arrows shooting down . A mean place . You would look to starve it out . I began to see the argument of Amen-khep-shu-ef . " On this day , however , the gates were open and the market was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . The King of Kadesh would not be hiding an army inside the walls of Megiddo when you could walk into the city and look about . So I knew that Monarch was not here with his men . Besides , Usermare would reach Megiddo in a few days , although by an easier road , and He would ask the questions that receive good answers . Whereas one dirty soldier with a battered chariot and two unseemly horses was more likely to be tortured himself than coax any truth out of strange tongues . So I drove around the walls of the town which took a long time , for the lanes were muddy , and it was a big town , but then I found a road on the other side that some had spoken of in Gaza . This road was easy to recognize , for it had paving stones and oak trees planted on each side , a royal road straight out of Megiddo to the north , vet I was the only vehicle on it . " I soon knew why . The paving stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I was on a wagon trail that had to he renowned for its ruts . Soon the fields disappeared and the forest grew in on me , and the horses and myself were afraid again . We were on the direct road to ' Pyre , hut it was not direct . It curved Irks a snake and even coiled hack and forth on itself to climb the higherp302hills . In the dark of late afternoon , I thought again of all I had heard of this road and its bandits . Even before I left Gaza , I listened to stories of how they raided caravans , and any merchant who did not know them well enough to pay tribute , was sold as a slave . Usually a merchant could write , and thereby serve as a scribe  --  a valuable slave ! Then the bandits kept the horses and sold the goods . There were so many thieves that it gave occupation to the men of Megiddo . They could always hire out as an armed guard on a caravan . " All the same , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would take four or five such robbers to bring me down . Afterward , one would be without an arm , another a foot , and maybe a third would never see again . I would die with my thumbs in somebody'seyes . They would gain nothing but a body , two mediocre horses , and a chariot they probably could not sell . The cart was close to coming apart . Unless I was carrying a sum of gold  --  which I was , but hardly looked so prosperous  --  I was not worth attacking . They would see me as a soldier who was lost , or a deserter ready to join any pack of thieves , or even as the scout I was indeed . And if they saw me as the last , why , they could do worse than offer a favor to an Egyptian scout in the army of Ramses the Second . Among our allies in Gaza had been a few Asiatics from nearby tribes , and by what they said , I knew there was a large fear of the new Pharaoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but in a quiet year no more than a few envoys would arrive from Thebes to collect tribute and talk to the Prince of the territory . They did not try to change the laws , nor interfere with the foreign temples . We Egyptians had a saying , Amon is interested in your gold , not your God . ' A sensible arrangement . Usually there was no trouble . " When a new Pharaoh ascended the Throne , however , it was different . The young Princes of Asia were more defiant . So , in all these lands of Lebanon and Syria had come the word : Ramses the Second was arriving with the largest army ever to march out of Egypt . If I were a thief , in that case , hiding in these dark hollows , with many a merchant offering a bounty for me , I would look to make an Egyptian my friend . Therefore , I did not hesitate . I took the most dangerous road to Tyre . Maybe I would fall in with a few brigands who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , but even larger was my fear of rejoining Usermare-Setpenerewith no information to offer.  | " So I kept moving . Here , the trail was wide enough for both my horses . Yet by evening the forest and hills were still around me . I bedded down in a grove , fed my horses some grain , ate of it myself with care not to crack my teeth on any pebble , and then prepared to sleep , using my charioteer 's cloak for a ground-cloth . It proved , however , too cold , and I soon preferred to sit with my back against a tree . That was better . The trunk felt like a friend behind me . It was as if we sat on watch , back against back , and searched the darkness . To my surprise there was more to see than I would have thought . No farther away than four or five long throws of a stone , a spark flew up in the darkness , and watching , I soon saw a small campfire . " The spirits in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel those spirits going deep into the earth , yet I could also feel them returning to the tree , and they were light as the feather of Maat . I heard the leaves speak to them on every little wind . So , too , was I able to hear the quiet of these woods , and by their hush did I pass through the wall of my own ears and into the movements of every small animal . The keenness of my hearing was so fine that I wondered if I had been blessed by the spirits of my tree since I felt no fear , and was strong for the first time in weeks . " I kept looking at the campfire . I could see little more than its light , yet by the sound , there could not be more than three men around it , probably two , and they spoke in a language whose tones were strange . " In the wild of this forest , I found it peaceful to hear these thieves ' voices . I knew it was the peace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . You can kill ,  --  or let him go . There is no peace so calm as that . Indeed , my Pharaoh always seemed to live in just such a way . " Now I felt the same power . My arm was ready to slay the first thief before the second would know I was there . " I stood up then . The horses were asleep and I sent them a thought as sure as the flick of my reins . Sleep in peace , ' I told them , and blow no wind through any hole . ' I meant it . Then I took off the coat of mail so that my skin could feel the nearness of any low bush , and in the darkness I began to walk toward the fire . Almost at once I lost my strength . My hearing disappeared . The fear ism . hack . The forest was no longer my friend , and I had to sit down once more against a tree . " Now I could hear the voices of the men again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I was eager to move , but so soon as I was on my feet , these powers departed . Only the touch of the tree , it seemed , could give me strength . Was I not like a blind priest in the Temple of Karnak feeling his way from column to column ? " Unable , therefore , to move , I told myself I could hardly approachthe campfire if I did not have my strength . " One thought , however , did come . If I was in a strange land , why did the Gods who lived in these trees offer Their confidence to me ? Why did They not give it to the thieves by the campfire ? It was their country . Maybe it was because those two good fellows  --  I could hear now that there were no more than two  --  were drunk , and so their minds were like a swamp and seeped out in all directions . Such is the power of wine . It is , after all , the juice that comes from a dying grape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin to die . So they were far away from nearby Gods . But I was close , as close as the touch of the leaves overhead . It was then I understood that the Gods of these trees were offended by the rudeness of those who dared to get drunk among Them . So I might not need to touch a tree if I thought less of the task ahead and stayed close instead to the spirits of the nearest branch . At this moment I felt blessed by the forest . I could even smell those trees who were happy , and know those who were not well  --  what a difference ! One complained of its roots which were growing between many rocks , another was fresh and young but shadowed by a taller tree . Still one other had been split by lightning and grew to a great size after being struck . It stood there like a crippled giant and inspired silence . I bowed my head as if truly passing a giant of a fellow who now stared only at the sky . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good force if I showed respect , and I paid attention to each step before me . Feeling , thereby , a fine peace , I passed through what these trees had to offer me ( and their thoughts were so pure they came to my senses like perfume ) and at last I reached the edge of a very small clearing where the fire burned . I saw two drunk thieves . They were wrestling with each other in a kind of dance , and laughing , and wet from the heat of the fire , each with his member stickingout through the old animal skins they wore . " They gave a shriek when they saw my sword , then flew apart , a wise move . Now I could not attack one without showing my back to the other . Yet it gave the choice of who to attack first . Both were tall , but one was slender and sly as a quick animal while the other was rich in his muscles , a body I could recognize as near to myp305own , and on the calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so , that the trees had offered , I nodded to both , smiled , and with a speed of arm faster than any I had shown before , put my sword through the slim man 's chest and felt his heart go right up my arm . I blazed within as if touched by Usermare-Setpenere . Until then , never , not even with my King had I known such a moment , equal to lightning , I would say , if lightning were bliss , and then the slim thief 's face began to change . The tricks he had played on others came over his expression one by one  --  thievery , betrayal , and ambushwere his hidden faces  --  but by the end , I saw a good man , not without bravery , and he died with a peaceful look . " The other thief could have run away in the time I took to look at what I had done , but he seized a rock instead , and threw it at my head . I ducked , and by then he had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would have a contest , and advanced on him . He threw one rock . Again I ducked . Then he hurled another at my chest , which I caught with my free hand . As he reached to the ground to pick up another , I knocked him flat with the stone I held , a good blow to the neck that finished his fight . As he lay on his knees , groggy as a cow given a blow in preparation for the knife , I took my sword and with the flat beat him on the back until he was soft like a steak that is pounded , very much alive , I promise you , for he yowled like a wounded beast , but soft . He had no will to send to his muscles . " It was then I discovered the gift Usermare-Setpenere had left in my bowels . Gift it was . I had known from the time He seized me by the hair and took me by the place no other man had ever reached , that something new had been left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then I had never had such an hour before . Now , I could feel the gift . It was nothing to take a boy from the rear , or a man , for that matter , if he were weak enough . I had done as much ever since I was a boy myself  --  weaker boys , animals , girls when I could find them . You had to find a girl whose father and brothers were more afraid of you than you of them , but , in any case , it had all been nothing , I was a soldier , not a lover , not even a soldier but a river . A flood rose , and I rose with it . " Here , Menenhetet paused before he said : " I would make it clan again , Good God , that I speak out of the innocence of mind I knew in my first life . In those years I never had a thought for the hotly I entered . Rather I did it to find the peace that comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may say that I have seen such light inp306an animal 's body . So there was nothing new about this thief except that he had a back and ribs that would have looked like my own if not so thoroughly marinated by the flat of my sword . Yet I never enjoyed a buggery so much . My hand flew into the thick hair at the back of his head , and I felt my member swell to the size of a King . I was large with the gift of Ramses the Second . No door could have withstood my horn . The thief shrieked like a beast disemboweled . The first slash of the butcher has gone wrong and the poor animal runs around the shop with its tripe falling out while the customers scream and the butcher curses . Those were the sounds this fellow made beneath me and I even felt the last of his strength  --  that power which is attached to each man 's Secret Name , if so I may put it  --  for it came right into my belly , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I loved his ass . It belonged to me . I could hardly take air through my nostrils so thick were my feelings . I had used holes before , but only to give me peace , as I have said . This time I was ready to steal the seven souls and spirits of this wretch , and when I came forth it was with all that had been put into me by Ramses the Great , the very message He inscribed on the walls of my insides . Even as the very center of me had been stolen by my Pharaoh , so did I steal it from another , and knew it could never stop . I had an appetite as strong as the color of my blood and knew I would keep trying to steal the seven souls of all I met , indeed when I was done , I kissed this fellow on the lips , and wiped my prick on his buttocks as a courtesy for the pleasure he had given me , then slapped it into his mouth in order to grow hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of such description . I took him through the night as if I possessed the Royal Member of Ramses the Great  --  may I speak with the truth that is found in the balance of Maat  --  I came to know the strength and the bravery and the cheap treacherous shit of this cutthroat whose name I never asked ( I spoke none of his language and he knew fifty words of Egyptian ) but before I was done , I had acquired all of his character that I would care to use and a few of his bad habits as well , or so I would have to think when I would find my fingers looking into the possessionsof others , yes , I took him so thoroughly that there was a thief in me for the next ten years , yet by the time I left him sobbing on the ground , grateful for the tenth time that he was not dead , he was also mourning all those qualities in himself he would never know again , and I had learned one matter of interest about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman on the Street of the Jewelersp307in the city of Tyre , of New Tyre , not the Old , and she was his secret whore . Of the armies of the King of Kadesh , this thief knew nothing except that there were armies . " I speak of this knowledge as if the thief and I both owned the same language and had met in a beer-house for a drink , but getting him to tell me took half the night , and a few tortures of the hair on his head . I ripped away half his scalp before all desire for him was out of me , and even then he stammered forth whatever words he had . Maybe he would have answered sooner if not for his lack of Egyptian words . They have narrow ears , these Syrians , so it took long . I would ask a question , but then I would enjoy the power of my body over his body so much that he could not even try to give the answer . I felt as if I had grown a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tree was being rammed into those secret turns of the bowel where the Secret Name is held . " He paused for breath and I felt my own Sweet Finger stirring . " I always knew that men took a great deal of pleasure in each other , " said my mother , " but I never understood the price . " " It is not always like that , " said Menenhetet . " Indeed , the night was unusual . " Ptah-nem-hotep said : " Perhaps our good Menenhetet also takes pleasure from the recollection . " " One must , " said Menenhetet . He shrugged . " In the morning , I kissed that poor thief again and sent him limping back to Megiddo , and worked the horses toward Tyre . I was over the worst of the mountains and it was a quick trip down  --  too quick  --  coming out of one of the ravines , we were going fast around a turn , hit a rock , and spilled . I went leaping off the road but landed on my feet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel . The horses were screaming in their traces and the shaft that goes from their harness to the cart had split at the fastening . In my pouch I had two hardwood spikes and leather thongs , but still lost half the day . Let me say I was no carpenter . " By the time Mu and Ta were harnessed again , the sun was overhead . What a ride was ahead of me ! The road became no smoother and the chariot groaned through every one of its fasten  --  ings . I did not know if I could get it all the way to Tyre and hardly knew why I wanted to . At this point , it would be faster to travel  --  m one horse with my weapons on the other , but then no charioteer wants to lose his cart . Mine , of course , had little to distinguish itjust a wood wagon . Still , it had the lines of a chariot , so my sensep308of what was proper did not suffer . While only a few specks of paint still stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those thongs around the shaft  --  as though it was waiting to fall apart again , I liked it enough to laugh , for my own post was sore at its root . Better you than me , old soldier , ' I said to the chariot , and we went on . " The road dipped , it climbed , it turned , but the forest began to open into fields , and around a knoll I could look down through the ravines to the sea . There was air in my lungs of a sort I had never breathed before , not even on the Delta , a smell  --  it had to be  --  of the Very Green itself , and wholly composed of fish , with an odor refreshing to my nose , not like the fish that rotted on the mud flats of the Nile . No , this good smell that came up into the hills from the loveliness of the Very Green was amazing to me , as clean as if I were breathing the very scent of Nut when She holds up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets into the sweat of men and some women . I began to cry because I had never known a lady like that . I do not mean that I wept like a child nor in weakness , but with a healthy longing now that my pride ( because of what I had done to the thief ) felt much restored . Besides , the water went out to a great distance , extending beyond the strength of my eyes until I could not find the place where the sky overhead came down to meet the sea and that was part of why I wept , as if a sight of the greatest beauty was being withheld from me . Then there were the ships . I was used to our own sailboats on the river , and the royal barks with their huge red and purple sailcloth , and their gold and silver hulls that gave more show of our great wealth than watching a royal procession , but these boats here on the Very Green  --  so far away I could not even see the color of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sight I had never known before . They rode through long curves of water that almost buried them , and their sails spread out like the wings of white butterflies . I could not believe how many I saw , and some by their direction were rowingaway from Tyre and some were sailing to it , although , as I descended , I could not see Tyre itself , only the stones by the shore . " Now , riding by the rocky coast , the road would sometimes climb over a spur of mountain that moved right into the sea like an arm in front of your nose , and sometimes our wheels would wobble along a trail that almost came down to the rocks of the sea , and these low roads were wet . I had never before seen such streams of water to come at you . The sea was like a serpent rolling down ap309hill , if a serpent were to do such , then smashing on the rocks . I was covered with spray from the Very Green , and what a taste it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devils that live in shells and something mysterious as well  --  maybe it was the smell of everything I did not know . All I can say is that the feel of the Very Green as it sprayed on me still had much to do with a lady for it was also light and contemptuous and playful , but could leave you chilled . " Then it grew dark and I realized there were many Gods and Goddesses in this sea , and Their feelings could shift . Certainly the serpents that rose from the water now smashed with more force on the shore , and left a noise like thunder . The spray began to sting my eyes . I was happy to climb a hill that lifted me above such spite , but realized even as I got out of the chariot to lift the wheels from one smooth bump to the next that here the hill was of solid rock , and workmen  --  back so long ago as Thutmose the Third , or was it nearer to the beginning with Khufu ?  --  must have labored for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was truly a stairway and would have impressed me more if not for our Egyptian works that are so much greater . Still , I learned another truth about the sea . For in the dark , the water struck the wall below the road , and this shock was like standing on the parapet of a fort while a siege army pounds on your gates with a battering ram . The spray flew up here to the height even of fifty or a hundred cubits above the sea , and when I looked down in the near dark , the Very Green had a million and infinity of mouths with white spit on all of them , and it growled and sucked at the ledge like a lion tearing at its prey . Even while I watched , came one massive blow of the largest serpent of water I had yet seen , a snake as large as the Nile , and it smashed the cliff so well that a full slab of rock gave a groaning sound , wrenched forth from its socket and fell into the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my road , and at the endless anger I could feel in the true Gods of the Very Green , that 1 wondered how I would even dare tomorrow to embark on a ship and ride over such serpents to the Island of New Tyre . I can only say that so soon as we were past the hill , the road , to my relief , moved inland , and I made camp , ate some wet grain with the horses , then slept shivering in my damp clothes . " In the morning , I had another fine view . The mountains fl moved away from the sea , and I could look across a long vaII that had fields tended like gardens , and orchards of olive trees . In the distance , a city stretched out along the sand . Across from it , VIPp310away in the water , were the towers of another city seeming to grow out of the Very Green itself . I knew the place on the beach was Tyre , and the one in the water was New Tyre , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so I hoped . My chariot had a comfortable sound despite the groaning of the shaft against the leather on our way back to the shore . "  | " GooD and glorious Ptah-nem-hotep , " said my great-grandJIJ. ' father , " when You spoke of the purple snails , I was silent and did not tell of my experiences in Tyre and Old Tyre . In truth , I had almost forgotten these purple snails and their stench . How that is so , I can hardly understand , for the old city stank of their corruption as one came near , and the alleys made you hold your nose . Yet the purple of the paving stones on every street with a dyer 's shop was so bright , it hurt the eye . One could even see the sky reflected in that wet purple . Still , the odor of those poor snails was so squalid that my first thought on riding through the gates was to suppose I had come in by the beggars ' quarters . The breath in my nose was like nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rotting teeth . You would think that is a scent to wilt the feather of Maat , but such is the purity of its odium that the horses began to frisk with each other for the first time in days . Since this put a strain on my crippled shaft , I had to dismount and hold Mu and Ta , all to the amusement of everybody watching . Witness my second surprise . I had never seen so many well-dressed people on such a mean-odored street . That was the cost of wealth here  --  you were obliged to breathe the air . " I confess , however , that the sudden playfulness of my horses was a common sight in Old Tyre . I do not know why foul-mulling places have such peculiar appeal  --  although Nut , we must rrrtum ber , was able to fall in love with no one but Geh  --  yet in this first life with my quick eyes , I never failed to find lovers busy with each other in caves and ditches , under hushes , in the cellars of vati1D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley . Never was I in A Clty where people fornicated so frequently in public . Maybe it was the sun on the hot beach in the daytime , and the glistening purple of the walls under moonlight , or something intimate in the nature ofp312the snail turning in upon itself , but I remember my proud shaft was full of blood from the hour I entered . " Tired of the battered virtues of my homely chariot , and the stupidity of my horses , I left them in the keeping of the stable boy in the courtyard of the House of the Royal Messenger of Ramses the Second , at least so soon as I could find his street . Indeed there were few people I approached in Tyre who did not understand what I said and they spoke back to me in a hoarse and somewhat guttural use of our language that rubbed agreeably on the lining of my ear and stirred some cockles of good feeling in my chest , although with it all , I still felt like striking them for how they disturbed the ceremonyof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon learned , was not in Old Tyre . He came to the House once a year to pick up tribute from the Phoenicians , and then went on to collect in other places ; I could see , however , that his arrival in this place would be like a visit by one of the sons of the Pharaoh . The Royal Messenger certainly had the largest place on the beach . Even compared to the villas of the wealthy of Tyre , it was near to a palace , and the servants of the Royal Messenger , many of whom were Egyptian , kept the House ready for his return . Never before had I seen such scruples in servantswhen the master is away , but then I came to understand that just about every Egyptian trader who passed through Old Tyre paid a call here to pick up the gossip of other merchants . In one room , I even saw a wall with cubbyholes in regular rows , containing many a roll of papyrus with a gold string and a seal of wax  --  letters left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta . Certainly , the servants kept the place up and I was content to rest there . " A day went by , then another day before I was ready to take a boat from Old Tyre to Tyre , indeed , that much time I needed to recover from my trip . I was not tired so much as confused . There was gossip to pick up in the home of the Royal Messenger , but after I heard it , I did not know whether the King of Kadesh was weak or powerful , cautious or aggressive . The only matter of which I could be certain was that everyone had information to offer , spoke in a voice that was full of authority , and contradicted what the last fellowhad said . " Of course , I was also curious to see this Old Tyre . I had never visited such a town . While the poor quarters were old and , with the stink , more miserable than anything you could find in Thebes , yetp313much was interesting , and the new streets made you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street there were so many empty plots . Even the town wall had breaches , and there were breaks in many a fence . The best streets often had ruins . Yet the town was prosperous . A trader explained it to me . The new Tyre out in the bay , having been built upon three islands , was impregnable . No army that marched in by land could take it , since such armies would be without boats when they arrived . Nor , for that matter , was there a navy who could defeat the fleet of Tyre . So that city on its three islands was equal to a fortress with a moat , and if it came to siege , they could never starve . Food would be brought in by sea  --  as was done already . So the people decided never to defend Old Tyre on the shore inasmuch as New Tyre could make more in trade than it would cost to rebuild Old Tyre after an army came through . That was why I saw so many empty plots and so much new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ago . Yet , the old city , I heard a lot of people say , looked newer than the new city . " All the same , New Tyre paid tribute to Egypt . I concluded that this was not from fear , but for profit . Every utnu they gave us brought back a hundred in trade with the Delta . Yes , they were certainly the first people I met who did not think themselves inferior to us . " On the third day , I took the ferry to New Tyre , and watched the oarsmen take us up the back of each rolling serpent , then slide down the other side . There were tears in my eyes from the wind , and I felt much consternation in my legs at the pitching of the boat . These were no thousand limbs of water , but more like twenty bodiesin a beer-house shoving you about , and the spray slapped my face . For that matter , it washed so far up my nose I could smell the end of the snail all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like nothing on shore . " This city on three small islands had no horses , for one matter , and everybody walked or was carried . In most places only three could go abreast . The walls of a house on one side of the street were never so far away from the other that you could not touch both walls with your hands , and then I had never seen buildings that went so high . One family lived on top of another , five families high , and the walls drew nearer to each other as they went up . It was nothing to leap from roof to roof , you almost stepped across . The door on the patio of each roof , as a result , was more securely barred against robbers than the door to the street.  | " I remember that as our ferry approached a landing , I could not think of a more crowded town to visit . There was no beach to the island , nothing but heavy sea and much wind , and jetties built out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people stood on every dock and quay . Behind them , the city had the look of cliffs facing other cliffs and there were the most extraordinarytowers on some of these roofs . You could also see every color of the palette on the painted walls . So it was the prettiest and most fearsome looking place . A thicket . These three islands were so close together that you could cross from one to the other by bridges built of wood above the water , but once in the city , you could never see the sky , no more of the sky at least than the little space between the buildings . There were no gardens , and no town squares . In the market , you could not move because the alleys were that narrow , but then , the place not only stank of snails , but the alleys curved like snails . You were always lost until you reached the outermost point of whatever little island you were on . Then you could look at the sea from the end of the alley before plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks , but there were no shadufs nor fresh water . You had to drink what you could of rainwaterfrom the cisterns and they were filled with the salt of the stones in that place . Everything was covered with spray that kept coming in on fogs and ended in the cisterns . I even wondered what the Phoenicians did for fresh water , until I learned the wealthy had their boats  --  you were not wealthy in that place unless you owned a boat and crew , which can not be said of all wealthy Egyptians  --  and the lady of the house would send to the mainland for spring water . I purchased some in the market and drank it all before I could stop . " Never had I been in a place where land was so valuable . Even the most expensive shops were small , and the workshops were more cramped than the houses . The traders offered wares made of gold or silver or purple glassware and vases . They even sold imitations of our Egyptian amulets and I heard they could trade with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteemed reputation of our curses and our charms . The poor fools who bought these copies in faraway ports would never know . But then you must imagine what was made in these workshops for foreign lands . Egyptian swords and daggers that never saw our Nile looked nonetheless like they belonged to us , and rings with scarabs had our cobra , or our lotus , engraved on the metal . I heard it said that you could gop315through Rhodes and Lycia , Cyprus and some other islands of the barbarian Greeks , and everywhere natives would be wearing Phoenicia'sjewelry , their bracelets , their collars , their damascened swords , chased swords , and every kind of material you could dye purple . " " But what , " asked my mother , " did such barbarians give back in trade ? " " Some had gold to offer . Probably they robbed it from other traders , or they paid in jewels , or bars of silver . Often , they sold their young men , their young women and their children . In some lands , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " that even though the Greek slave is as hirsute and rank-smelling as any Syrian when he arrives , he does seem to learn from us . And quickly . " Menenhetet nodded . " I can tell You that the secret whore of the King of Kadesh was a Greek , and there were few who could still teach her . But then , the prostitutes of Tyre were regarded with respect , at least the more famous ones , and while I did not enter the Temple of Astarte and can give You no account of the priests , I heard it said that , under certain conditions , prostitutes were like priestesses there and much respected . This was , however , told to me while I was still in a state of confusion from all I was seeing . Never were so many people from so many lands gathered in a single place . Going the length of one alley that ran from the quay where I landed to the Temple of Melkarth , I saw Phoenicians and Amorreans , mountaineers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattooed blacks , men from Elam , Assyria , Chaldea , Urati , and every archipelago , sailors from Sidon , crewmen from Mycenae , and more costumes than I could distinguish , high boots , low boots , barefoot , colored shirts , white shirts , red and blue wool capes , animal skins , our white linen , and the hair of Your head in a hundred styles . Most of the Phoenicians were , themselves , nude to the waist and wore short cotton skirts of many colors . You could recognize the rich because they had their hair done in ringlets down their back , and four rows of curls on top like four serpents of the sea , back to back . With it all , everything stank worse in New Tyre than Old . All day long , people were combing snails off the rocks of these three islands , and children would dive for them . I had never known that people could swim , yet here I saw ten-year-olds go beneath the water like fish . " My room on this island was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the walls of purple fabric . The sarcophagus of an Egyptianp316merchant of no great wealth is larger in size than that room . You could not stand up in my abode and the hall was so narrow people were not able to pass each other . Later , I heard the sound of a couple thumping away over my close ceiling , and realized that mine was only one of two little bedrooms , one above the other . All up and down my floor , two bedrooms to one true ceiling ! Of course , each sarcophagus had a window , I will say that , and through it you could pour your leavings . I had learned of that local habit already . My boots could have told you more . A true sign of poverty in Tyre was to walk barefoot . " " I can not believe everything you are telling us , " said my mother . " On the contrary , " said my father , " I have spoken to a few who trade in Tyre and it is still the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a life ? Here , on our desert , we have room for all . Sometimes I feel my thoughts extending out so comfortably , that all of me , that is , my thoughts and myself , could fill a tent . In Tyre , however , there is only space on the sea . Never had I felt the presence of others so powerfully , and I discovered that in the midst of such congestion , it is impossible to think . My thoughts felt bruised . Yet my heart was warm . In all the stink of those decomposing snails , human bodies were sweet . Even old sweat smelled like perfume next to such putrescence , and of course no one bathed , not when water could be measured in gold . " " That place is a pestilence and a nightmare , " my mother said . " No , " Menenhetet told her , " I came to like it . You could walkalong the canals they cut into each island . They would put boats upin dry dock by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were Gods , and built them of the best timber from Lebanon  --  from the forests , indeed , through whichI would soon pass  --  and from the oaks of Ananes . What boatsthey were ! What crews ! It was told to me that of all the ships inthe Very Green , only the Phoenicians did not hug the shore andworry about making port each evening , but traveled instead throughthe darkness , daring every monster that came to the surface duringthe long night . These people could even steer by the stars , and ifthe one they followed was covered over by clouds , they would guidetheir trip by calling upon another star . Where there were none , haveno fear , they would steer into the waves and wait for the sun . Wecan sail to the land of the worst dreams , ' was one of their sayings . How can I tell you ? These sailors were as proud as charioteers , andp317the poorest of them acted like a rich man in every beer-house . I saw fights in those dens that were good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long benches where you sipped your drink , and the elbow of your neighbor was on your neck . That was all right since your own elbow was on the next neck . One could not call one 's skin one 's own , and the wine was sour as vinegar , yet we lived in a happy delirium , for on a raised platform just large enough for one girl , there was a whore who took off her skirt and  --  since the boy is asleep I will tell you  --  showed the center of herself with such readiness that your eye might have been looking through a keyhole at another eye . She was some kind of Asiatic with the darkest hair , and a body the color of leather but the lips between her thighs were like an orchid whose petals are black at the tip and pink in the center and I do not know if till then I ever desired a woman so much . Perhaps it was the look on her face . She wanted all of us . As proof , she arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in turn to each man . I remember I put my desire into my eyes , and her petals quivered before my look even as a lotus plant will wave slowly when you look on it hard enough . Then more desire rose in me out of what came back from her . In the circle around that whore , men were putting gifts on the platform , and when the music finished she went off with the highest bidder . I did not show my gold . It was the Pharaoh 's and to be used only for the purchase of information . So I was desperate . How had that woman put so much into my loins ? " Then I learned she was not only a prostitute of this quarter who went from wine-parlor to wine-parlor along the alley but was also on this night a priestess . Before the dawn , she would fornicate on the altar of Astarte in the dark temple near the dry docks . It was the belief of these Phoenicians that in the filthiest could be found the finest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is why they were so happy with their stinks of snail and the royal purple glistening on every wet stone . My head felt like thunder trying to comprehend their religion . For in showing herself to all of us , she had also been serving her Goddess Astarte ( whom some called Ishtar ) , yes , the whore was working for Astarte , collecting the lust of all of us in her black ( and pink ) orchid just as a flower receives the blessings of Ra , except here in the new city of Tyre , they never saw the sun in their alleys , and so it had to be the heat in our belly that was served up to the Goddess , why that whore would collect enough of you to make a sacrifice splendid and glowing right outp318of the heart-meat of her thighs , yes , send it up to the roof of the Temple of Astarte . " I was ready to burst . It was a common sight in these alleys to see people urinate , or expose their buttocks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and I felt so foolish and wild that I rushed back to my room to smother my fever . The truth is I was looking for a man as much as a woman . The thief had given me a taste for that . How I longed to be at Kadesh and with the battle begun . " Yet as soon as I lay down in my bed , I felt an impulse to get up , that is not to stand for you could n't , but to squat under the beams and look out my window . There , another orchid was to be seen ! It belonged , as I soon found out , to the secret whore of the King of Kadesh . " In our own Egypt , we know what it is to live in the thoughts of another . We are famous for our power to lay the most effective curses , and this is due , of course , to the comfort with which we can leave our own mind and rest in the next . One has to know one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , I should think , comes naturally from our desert and our river . In great spaces , the mind can travel as well as the body . On this unspeakable island of congestion , however , this damp Tyre , given the closeness of all our bodies , no thought from one mind could ever penetrate another . In Memphi or Thebes , I would not have been surprised if the secret whore of the King of Kadesh had taken abode in a house across from me  --  assuming she was the person I had come to find . Our minds race ahead of us and summon strangers . But in this beehive , this ant-heap , no ! Later , when I pondered it , I was amazed that I came upon the secret whore so easily . I did not yet understand that in Tyre , in the absence of every message that one mind can give silently to another , the tongue substitutes for the brain . Gossip is even more common that money in Tyre . So it was known that I was a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was either a deserter , or an officer on a mission for UsermareSetpenereand must certainly be the second since I did not have that unhappy look no deserter can avoid . " " I agree , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " that this woman must have heard you were in town , but how could she know you wanted to see her ? " " That is the point , Good and Great God . She was the one who decided to meet me . Retaliation was what she wanted upon thep319King of Kadesh . Of course , I did not know that then . I saw only a woman who wore nothing , lying on a bed across the street from me , her window no more than an arm 's length from my window . She was beautiful in a way I had not known before . Later , over the years of my first life , and through the experience of lives I was yet to know , I would come to learn that women are as different from each other as our desert from the Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were beauties so lovely they lived in the Pharaoh 's gardens and were called little queens , and then there were the whores you found in beer-houses . Nor could I speak about ladies of good birth . I knew such noble ladies were not like other women , just as you could not speak the same word for courtesans and common prostitutes , but then , for all I knew to say to either , ladies and courtesans were more alike to me than not , by which I do not mean I was familiar with any of them , but only that ladies took pleasure in the way they spoke , and courtesans knew how to sing , acid either way I was always completely uncomfortable with their splendid manners , whereas any woman who was lower than me felt comfortable , speak of the ugly farmgirls I knew when I was a boy and peasant , and the good-looking farmgirls and beer-house girls and servants when I was a soldier , I took what I could and thrust myself into all of them as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man and a woman , except with a woman , you were more likely to see the face . and that could be preferable . All the same , as I have said before , I made love like a soldier , simple as that . " With this secret whore of the King of Kadesh , however , I was in the presence of a magician . Just as we all know when we are kneeling before a person of great power , so did I know , looking through my window , that this woman was no whore to make you eat out your eyes in a wine-parlor or carry your lust to the altar , no , she might be without clothes , and her gates open , she might lie on her back , knees out , yet never was a woman less unclothed . She was , if you take the fear in my heart , a temple . I felt no haste to go over to her . Just as one must make no error when offering a sacrificeto Amon , and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so did I lift myself from my bed , remove my own white skirt and boots , and in the most grave and comfortable motion , as if I were a cat walking the rail of a balcony , leaned out of my window , four stories in the air , and leaped across to hers . Then , with a smile that had no triumph , only my courtesy , I approachedp320the bed on which she lay  --  it was all of purple silk  --  and knelt at her feet and was ready to touch her ankle , but as I drew near , it became more difficult to move , no , not more difficult , more circuitous , as if I could not approach directly but must respect the air , and halt . I was not two steps away from the bed , yet I could as well have been climbing a long stairway for all the time it took , and through it , her eyes and mine looked into one another for so long that I came to understand how an eye does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a passage , or so you may believe on the first time you look into eyes that are the equal of your own . Hers were more beautiful than any I had known until that day . Her hair was darker than the hair of any hawk , but she had eyes of violet-blue , and by the light of a candle , they were near black when she turned her head to the shadows , yet against the purple sheets , blue again , even a brilliant purple , except it was not their color I saw but the transparency of her eyes . I felt as if I were looking into a palace , and each of its gates would open , one by one , until I could look into another palace . Yet each eye was different , and each palace was wondrous in size and had the color of every gem . The longer I stared , the more I could swear I saw red rooms and golden pools and my eyes traveled toward her heart . Since I did not dare to kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , having never done so ) I put my hand on the bed near her thigh . " Once , during those days I traveled alone , the mood of the forest had become so powerful I stopped . The air was too heavy to breathe . I raised my sword then from its scabbard and drew it down slowly as if to cut through invisibility itself . Such had been the stillnessthat I swear I heard one fine note as pure as the plucking of a string , at least so clearly had I cut the air of the mood , and in a resonance of all my senses that was now as deep , I laid my touch on her flesh , and she returned a sound from her throat as pure and musical as a rose if the flower could speak . I knew then that I would make no mistake . Every sound that came from her mouth was a guide where next I could lay my touch , and to my surprise , since I had never heard of such an act , nor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounding the point to harbor , came down past her knees and I put my nose into that place out of which all children are born and smelled the true heart of this woman . She was rich and cruel and lived with a terrible loneliness in the center of this congested old city of New Tyre , although with it all , there was such loveliness in the quiver of those lower lips , and such subtlety ofp321experience that I began to kiss her there with all my face and heart , with all the happiness of an animal learning to speak . Never had I known that my lips could offer such delicacy of movement , it was as if splendid words I had never uttered were now at the tip of my tongue , and soon I was wet with her from eyelashes to chin , wet as a snail , and indeed she smelled like the sweetest snail and more , she was the only garden on the island . I felt as if I lived in a light close to violet itself . All the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrained as the purring of a cat in pure heat . Again , I knew I could make no error , and before long was introduced to the pleasures of that two-backed beast which lives with one head at either end , and her tongue felt like three Goddessesbringing peace to all the clangor of sword on shield that had been the harsh sum of my testicles , my asshole , and my cock , may the Pharaoh forgive me for so speaking in His presence , but this is the Night of the Pig . " " I am content that the child is asleep , " said my mother , but her voice was sweet and carried the nicest rough edge to stir through my chest as I lay by her knee . Having listened to my great-grandfatherspeak of wondrous palaces in an eye , I now felt a kingdom stirring in the forest of her thighs while his voice went on to tell us more . " In that manner , with a sense of respect as wide as the tide of the sea when it washes against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a small bird in my hand , I lay with the brow of my member on the edge of those lips I had kissed with such devotion and promisesthat were new to me pushed so powerfully within my belly that I was tempted to have it all now and live with the fire left behind . But I could feel an invitation to know her further , and so I entered this temple that was like a palace , and descended step by step in the pulsing of my muscles , and felt the brush of her hair against mine as we went down into a splendor of many lights , rose and violet and lemon-green were their hue , and then a great serpent of the sea washed over me and I was gasping in the rush of my seven souls and spirits for they leaped out of my body and into her , even as her seven parts were coming to me . Some battle took place while each of us made great swings of a sword that cut no heads , and we were in a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her loins kept pulling on me . It had not been bliss  --  not as I was to know it later  --  indeed , in the middle , my loins knotted , but I also knew for the first time what it was to make love and be given the full valuep322of a woman 's heart , her greed , her beauty , her rage , and all equal to my own . May I say it was my first great fuck . " There are men who measure their life by success in battle , or by the victories of their will over other men . There may even be a few like myself who can measure each life by other lives . In this , however , my first life , I had just learned that it can also be a journey from one extraordinary woman to another . The secret whore of the King of Kadesh was my first . " " How did you know who she was ? " asked my mother . " How , I can not say  --  maybe it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we were done , however , I did not doubt that I knew the King I soon might meet in battle . I knew him . If I met this King of Kadesh on the battlefield , I would know how to fight him . His heart was in my possession . By the way she gave herself to me she held her King in contempt . Do not inquire how I , who knew so little about women , could now know so much  --  it was the gift she had to offer . Women 's gifts are never so profound as when they take revenge on a lover . " Yet I did not even say her name , and would not see her again . A night so beautiful as this could not be repeated unless one was ready to live with the woman forever . I speak now out of the extravagance of four lives and twenty such women , twenty such lost empires , but the secret whore of the King of Kadesh was the first , and we held each other until the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the common name in Egyptian for the commonact . She was much amused that it is written with the sign for water above the sign of a cup . Nak , ' she kept saying , and repeated after me , Nak-nak , ' giggling as if it were a wonderful sound and had a true echo , all the while pretending she had never heard it before . " I wanted to know about her , I , who had never had curiosity for a woman 's story , but all I learned was that she had been kidhappedby Phoenicians when a child . A boat came to her island in Greece , and the captain sent two sailors to shore . Would the chief and his daughters come out to the ship ? She had gone with her sister and her father . As soon as they were on board , the boat pulled up anchor . So she had been brought to Tyre . Now , she was the High Priestess of all the whores in the Temple of Astarte , yet remainedtrue ( except on festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had three children by him . " How much of this was so , I can not say . She told it like a talep323she had told often . Besides her use of our language was limited . Still , I was certain she hated the King . Finally , she told me where she thought he was hiding . With her finger she made a small circle on the purple sheets to show me Kadesh , and drew another finger down from the circle to show me a river . Then she made small hills with her cupped hands . He is in the forest , ' she said to me , but not for long . He has boasted too much of how his army can destroy the Egyptians . Still I never know when he will visit . Maybe your Pharaoh will not know either . ' She sighed . I think you need your eyes . ' She kissed me then on each one of them , and prepared to leave . It was close to dawn , and I had to wonder if she would join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After she was gone , I stepped across to my room and lay on my red sheets and tried to sleep but I could only think of the war to come and all the ways a soldier could die , and I hoped I was not afraid of the King of Kadesh but that he would know fear of me . Before the sun was up , I took the ferry back to Old Tyre , returned to the House of the Royal Messenger , and inquired about roads into the mountains toward the East . " I soon had a decision to make . The shaft of my chariot had been repaired by the carpenter to the Royal Messenger , but since he did not have a piece of seasoned napeca wood and the other chariotshad shafts too small to borrow , he had merely made new splints and attached fresh thongs . I did not think it would hold me to Kadesh , nor did I want to ride by the main road . There could be Hittiteson the route to capture me . So I decided to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in my feelings from the way I arrived in Tyre , but I had no information then , and did not wish to meet Ramses the Second with neither a report nor a vehicle . Now my message would take care of the loss . So I packed my equipment on Mu , saddled Ta  --  traded the chariot for the two new harnesses  --  and went up into the mountains by a trail that must have belonged to a wild ram , or maybe a wild rabbit , it was that narrow . The horses ' bellies were soon raw both sides from the scratch of branches . Yet I enjoyed it . I knew I could make no great error . The sun was up and I could take direction from that . Besides , I needed only to climb up an ascending floor , then cross a great ridge , travel across another valley , climb another great ridge and beyond would be the valley of the Orontes . I knew I would find the armies of my Pharaoh near that river . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held His great tent had six wheelsp324to a side , and eight horses drew it . You would not have to wonder which road He was on , only that it be wide enough . " On my route , however , I was not halfway up to the first ridge before the thicket grew dense and the briers so agitated the horses that I was in a lather of perspiration myself what with pulling thorns from their hide without getting kicked as they thrashed , and the cedars were now so tall I could not see the sky . To the rear , the sun was only a dull glow and cast no shadow . I might never have left Tyre if I had known the gloom of these steep woods . " So I made camp and slept . Next morning I was up to travel through all of the day and then another , and thought I would never come to the end of the forest . In great gloom , I had to sit each night with no fire . I did not dare . There could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the move with the dawn , leading my horses through the early mists while thinking for the first time in many a year of Osiris and how His Ka must have traveled through mists like these in the time of His great loneliness when His body was still in fourteen scattered parts , yes , these were sights appropriate to the Lord of the Land of the Dead , the pillars of these forests coming forward like sentries one by one as we walked in file through the fog , and I only kept my direction by the knowledge that I had not turned astray for the moss still grew on the same side of the rocks . I kept the moss to the right of us . Through a long day that made me feel as old as some of these trees , we climbed to the secondridge and by evening made it through a gorge where the boulderswere so huge I had fear of serpents lurking in the caves of these great rocks . Then , after we had gotten through , it grew dark . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was no longer in Lebanon , I calculated , rather in Syria , and these great cedars belonged to another God . No strength came to me . I felt weaker than at any time since I left Megiddo and knew then that the secret whore of the King of Kadesh had taken more of my strength than she had given me of hers , although , of course , I had to suppose such strength had come in the first place from the thief whose back I had beaten with my sword , which was a thought to suggest that those who make love for a night had better be as adept as thieves . At last , I fell asleep between the horses , all three of us together for warmth , and let no one say a horse is not the equal of a plump woman except no woman ever passed so much wind . " Then , in the morning , the dawn was up before I awoke , and through the thinning of the trees , I could see the fields of Syria in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's march , must be Kadesh , and I thought I saw the glint of sun on chariots , hundreds , or was it thousands of chariots , somewhere behind the town to the north . " Beneath me , not an hour 's ride straight down the last of these slopes , I could see the van of my own armies . The Honor Guard of Usermare-Setpenere was camped there by a ford of the river . Lookingon them , I knew  --  for I can still feel this sensation to a certainty  --  that other eyes were watching as well . Back of me in the forest , like a rock falling with my thought , came the sound of hooves as a horse began to ride away with news to be brought to the King of Kadesh , yes , the echo of fast-moving hooves . "  | " THE fields were empty , and I must have been visible from a long distance as I cantered in on the last long slope to the river . The outpost of my Pharaoh 's armies nearest to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Egyptian fashion . May I say how well it works . To sit on the ground with your wrists lashed behind your neck is cruel . I thought my sword arm would come out of my shoulder . However , a charioteer recognizedme as I came down the ridge , and he galloped over and soon had me released . " It was a sure sign , however , that the outposts were fearful . On our ride into camp , I found out from my charioteer that the bivouac here at the ford of Shabtuna would not be broken this morning . So the troops could have an afternoon to take care of equipment and rest their feet . The officers , however , were not at ease . Usermare-Setpenere was in a great state of anger , I was told . His scouts had still picked up no knowledge of our enemy , and everything was taking too long . The vanguard might be here at Shabtuna , but only the Division of Amon was close behind . The Division of Ra was half a morning back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail being too narrow for any quick passage of wagons , the Divisions of Ptah and Set were just at the beginning of this march , a full day to the rear . I had a picture then of how they must be stuck in the middle of the gorge , and I could even hear the cursing of the wagoners and the fearful voices of the horses . " Worse than that , explained my friend , nobody knew what we would find at Kadesh . Last night Usermare-Setpenere had said to His officers , The Monarch of the Hittites does not deserve to be a King . ' Our Ramses was in a rage . It was maddening that He must advance to Kadesh without knowing whether it would be battle or siege.  | " I was trying to decide the worth of my news . Would He be ready to hear ? I was not , however , to see our Pharaoh so quickly . There were ten officers waiting to speak to Him , and I , full of the most unusual uneasiness , went walking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stomach had died . " In those days , we still made camp in the same manner as in the age of Thutmose the Great . So , on this morning , the pavilion of the King was erected in the middle of the officers ' tents , and the royal chariots were on all four sides . This square was surrounded by our cattle and provenance , and infantrymen were placed to the outside , their tall shields planted vertically on the ridge of an earthworkdug the night before . In that way , we were like a fortress of four walls of shields , and you even entered through gates , except they were not real gates , just the road and a platoon of infantrymen either side of that opening . Inside , you could stroll about , and visit your friends . If not for my message , it might have been good to feel like a soldier again . On ordinary days little made me happier than to be inside a camp , even if many did nothing but snore , or sharpen the blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On this day , in the expectation that we might still be marchinginto battle  --  what life had an army without rumors ?  --  many a Nubian put on his helmet , and would not take it off . These blacks , some in leopard skins , some wearing long white skirts with an orangesash slung from the right shoulder , made quite a sight . The blacks liked to be seen , and I watched five of them arguing in one place , and ten sitting so quietly in another that their silence was stronger than clamor , curious soldiers about whom we charioteers disagreed , some saying the Nubians would prove brave in combat , others said no . I knew they were strong , but I thought of them as horses , brave until frightened , and much in love with their plumage . Like horses , the Nubians would put at least one yellow feather at the top of their leather helmets . What a contrast they made to the Syrians who often had bald heads , no helmets , and big black beards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my King might see me , all discomfort went away , and I relaxed in the sun with other charioteers and told of my adventures , keeping the best to myself , and walked back and forth through the inner and outer square , the goodness of Ra warming my flesh , so that at last I was down to no more than my sandals and a loincloth , lolling about like half the soldiers on that ground , and the day grew lazy . I stopped for a while at the shop of the Royal Carpenter to tell himp328of the loss of my cart , but he was too busy to care , for he was putting together a chariot from two broken buggies , and promised to do better for me than that , since his workmen could return you six chariots ready for battle out of seven half-dismembered carcasses , and I listened to him while he stood in the middle of his shop with chariot wheels in one stack , the spokes for wheels in another pile , and heaps of broken parts on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move . " Then I watched other infantrymen carrying paniers of water up from the ford to a large leather bag hung from three sticks in the center of camp , and horses being walked to the blacksmith shop . I watched soldiers drinking wine , and a few were wrestling , and two others led a couple of cows to the field kitchen . I smelled the sweat of the day and the odor of roasting meat . Two of the soldiers drinking wine began to skirmish with daggers . They had been doing it for a long time and knew how to lunge at each other , then stop short . A Sherden , sweating like a fountain in his red and blue woolen cape , was beating a donkey who had gotten his nose into a bag of provisions . The food so excited the beast that he promptly got an erection . The Sherden kept beating on him and the donkey kept scampering away but never lost his excitement , nor took his head out of the bag , not while I watched . Next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rolling in the dust . " Most of the men were sleeping . The afternoon grew lazier still , and I could feel the fatigue of all the days of the march that had brought these troops this far , and then felt my own fatigue , and went back to a tent I was sharing with other charioteers and fell asleep on a ground-cloth , only to be awakened by word the King would see me now . In bewilderment , still dreaming of forests and thieves , I stood up , threw water on my face from a bowl , and went over to the King 's Pavilion . I had been dreaming of the Hittitesand saw a road where they planted sharpened stakes , and Egyptian soldiers were dying on them . Slowly in my dreams , bodies slid down the stakes . My bowels were cold . I took a slug of wine from a skin , and that made me sweat . Looking like a man whose insides must belong to others , I entered the great tent of Ramses the Second . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not only His sanctuary for prayer , and His bedroom , but a dining room as well , and then a great room for anyone to whom He would give audience . On this day many officers and Generals and the Prince , Amen/khep-shu-ef , were with Him , yet when I entered He was so impatientthat He began to speak before I had finished touching my head to the ground . Would you , ' He asked , give up the richest province of your lands without striking a blow ? ' " My Lord , I would try to fight like the Son-of-Ra . ' " Yet , some here tell Me that the King of Kadesh is two days ' march on the other side , and dares not come nearer . He is a fool . I will let all know his shame . The stone I put up to celebrate my victory will show that the name of the King of Kadesh is equal to what you see between a whore 's thighs ! ' " It was hot in the tent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hot again from forty officers ' bodies , but the greatest heat came from my Pharaoh . He was like a fire on a hot day in the desert . Who says he will not defend Kadesh ? ' I asked . " My Pharaoh pointed to two shepherds sitting quietly in a corner . By the dust of their long robes , they looked as if they had been traveling with their animals for a hundred days . Now , with smiles that showed their teeth  --  the teeth that were left  --  they bowed seven times . Then the older spoke , but in his own language . The **26;11111;TOOLONG , one of our Generals , exchanged the Bedouin 's words for ours , but only after each breath the shepherd took , and he took many breaths . " O Beloved Ramses , Adored-by-Truth , ' I heard , does not the Good and Great God know happiness when He cuts off the head of His enemy ? Does that not give Him more delight than a day of pleasure ? ' " I saw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow grave voice as deep and full of echo as any prophet , O **43;11139;TOOLONG , **57;11184;TOOLONG , know that we have come to Your throne of gold '  --  and indeed my Usermare-Setpenere was sitting on a small chair of solid gold  --  to speak for our families . They are among the greatest of the great families who are sworn to Metella , King of Kadesh and chief of the Hittites . Yet our families say that Metella is our chief no longer , because his blood has become the color of water . His force is to Yours as the eye of the rabbit to the eye of the bull . Metella sits in the land of Aleppo and can not find the courage to march to Kadesh . So our families have sent us to You , as a pledge of their desire to become Your subjects . '  | " I am honored , ' said Usermare-Setpenere , because I know you tell the truth . He who does not tell the truth before Me is a man who will soon lose the limb that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts with both eyes before his eyes are sent to join the lost parts . ' " Never had I heard my Pharaoh speak that way , but then I had never felt such heat come off His body . I believe these men are telling the truth , ' He said , how dare they lie ? ' But in the same anger , He turned to me and said , Do you believe them ? ' When I was silent , He laughed . You do n't ? You believe they are so brazen as to deceive your Pharaoh ? ' " I believe them , ' I said . I think they tell the truth that is the truth of their family . Yet it is several days since they have left . While they have been making their journey to us , so may the armies of the King of Kadesh have also been traveling. 0 **26;11243;TOOLONG , ' I said , so frightened that I also struck my head seven times to the ground , in the dawn , this morning , as I descended from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an army . ' " You say an army ? ' " I saw the light of an army . I saw the light that is made by lances , and swords , and the polished metal on shields . ' " But you did not see the swords ? ' asked the Prince Amenkhep-shu-ef . Only the light ? ' " Only the light , ' I admitted . " The light is from the river that flows around the walls of Kadesh , ' said the Prince . A good many of the Generals laughed . When our Pharaoh did not , however , they were silent . Now I knew why the heat that came from my Pharaoh was so strange . Hera-Ra was not by His side . I remembered then how much of the heat used to come from the beast . Yes , the Generals were now silent before Usermare-Setpenere the way once they had been silent before HeraRa . " On your travels , what did you hear about the King of Kadesh ? ' I now was asked . " That Metella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly . That he has a large army . That he will come on us suddenly . ' " It is untrue , ' roared the Pharaoh . Under the black and green of His cosmetic , I saw how the whites of His eyes were red . It is untrue , ' He repeated , yet I believe it is true . ' He glared at me as if I had taunted Him . " A discussion began whether to break camp in the dawn andp331march to Kadesh with the first two divisions , or , whether  --  and here I could not keep silent and was soon in the debate  --  it would be wise to wait one more day . Let the last two divisions come through the gorge . Then , ' I said , we can march onto the great plain with a horn to the left and a horn to the right . ' I said horn ' because I remembered that on the day we traveled to His tomb , Usermare had told me how Thutmose the Great never said wing ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a head and two horns , a Mighty Bull . " My Pharaoh nodded . He looked into Himself and saw His Chariot at the center of a great army on a great field with two horns , and I thought He would give the order to wait . But Prince Amen-khep-shu-ef also knew His Father , and said , On that great field we may wait for another week , while the King of Kadesh does not come . Our men will fight with each other . They will desert . We will look foolish , and our horn will crumble . ' " The Pharaoh nodded to that as well . Now , the council was concluded . He gave the order . We would break camp in the dawn . That evening , Usermare-Setpenere stood on the cage that held His lion . One night in the forests of Lebanon , Hera-Ra had eaten one of our soldiers . So a cage had been built for him next morning . Now our Pharaoh spoke to all of us from the top of that cage , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by the Great Pharaoh , Thutmose the Third . The King , Himself , led the way of His troops . He was mighty at their head like a flame . So will I be mighty at your head . ' The soldiers cheered . I knew again that I was part of an army , for the evening was red once with its own light , and red again with our cheers . Thutmose went forth to slay barbarians , ' said our King , and none was like Him . He brought back all the enemy Princes even though their chariots were wrought with gold . ' We cheered again . Each time our Pharaoh spoke of gold , we cheered . All fled before Thutmose , ' said our King . In such fear did they run that their clothing was left behind . ' A great snickering laugh huge as a river of mud came out of us . Yes , they abandoned their chariotsof gold and silver '  --  we gave a sigh like the whisper of moonlight on water  --  and the people of Megiddo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their skin . In this hour , the armies of Thutmose could have captured the city . ' Here , our King paused . lout they did not , ' He said . Our soldiers gave all their attention to the plunder left on the field . So they lost the treasures that were inp332the city . The men of Megiddo were stretched on the field like fish , but the army of Thutmose picked at their bones like gulls . ' A groan came up from us . Do not act , ' said Ramses , like gulls . The city that was not taken on that day had to be besieged for a year . The army of Thutmose had to work like slaves to cut down forests so that they could build walls to approach the walls of Megiddo . And the work was not done until all of the wall of Megiddo was surrounded by the wall of Thutmose . It was a year 's work . The city starved , but in that time , they also hid their gold . It was lost to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the plague-ridden greeted the armies of Thutmose . So I say to you that we will fight a great battle , but none of you will take plunder until I give My word ! It is Asiatic hands I want to see on the pile , not Egyptian . ' " We cheered . We cheered with fear in our throats and disap-i pointment in our loins at the thought of less plunder , but we cheered , and the lion roared . Next morning at dawn after a night when few of us could sleep , we broke camp and crossed the ford at Shabtuna . Although the water in the deep places came to our chest , not a man111 nor a horse was drowned . Disturbed , however , in their nests at the riverbank , beetles gathered like clouds and came between us and the sun . The swarm of their flight was so thick that it left us in shadow . No one saw a good sign in the rising of these beetles . " Once we were across , we formed our ranks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Orontes that leads to Kadesh . Its soil is as baked as a parade ground . May I say that our horses and our chariot wheels rode over the bodies of all the beetles that had tired of flight . We left the mark of our route as much behind us as if we had trampled through a field of berries . Beetles were in our hair and clothing like a pestilence . " Again I could feel the impatience of my Ramses . He was in the vanguard of the march . His charioteers , taken together with His Household Guard of the strongest Sherdens and Nubians , giants all , had , counting everyone , not five hundred men . We were certainly in the van . There was a clear distance behind us and the first troops of the Division of Amon . Worse . Looking back from a rise , I could see how far we had marched this morning across the plain . But the troops of Ra were just crossing the ford . It would be half a day before the Division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still jammed in the gorge . They would be no use to any of us until night . " All the same , I was happy to be in the van . The dust was less.  |p333Clouds  rose from the hard-baked clay of this plain that were thick enough to drive away the beetles , and such clouds drifted back on Amon and its five thousand marching men . It would have been like passing through smoke to ride with that division . " How we must have been visible from Kadesh ! Through the dust , we could see it in the distance where the sky met the hills . The city was not an hour 's ride away on a fast horse , but would take us until afternoon , I knew , because now we were winding through lightly forested rises , and could see ahead no more and so could not go forward without pause , but had to send out scouts , then wait for their return . " I was carrying a weight in my chest like the heart of a dead man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the midst of my oppression , alert , as if throngs were waiting inside me for the battle to begin . I tried to think of what I would do if I were Metella , the King of Kadesh , and where in these woods would I choose to attack the Household Guard of the Pharaoh so that I could capture my great Ramses ? Then it seemed to me I would prefer to wait until half the division of Amon was past , or even half the Division of Ra , so that I could strike at a large force when it was stretched out on the trail of the forest as long and vulnerable as a worm you could cut in half . Still , the effort of trying to think as if I were someone other than myself , especially a foreign King , made me know vertigo , and I supposed I was living with a fearful gift from the secret whore of the King of Kadesh . Maybe I was not trying to think like this Metella so much as I was indeed living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were so then our vanguard would go forward untouched and the Division of Amon as well . It would be on Ra that the thunder would fall . " My fear was replaced by woe . At this instant , we were in no danger , yet in a greater danger . I could never tell this to UsermareSetpenere . He was riding with His son Amen-khep-shu-ef in my place . That left me as a driver for no one better than the **25;11271;TOOLONG . This fellow was a General called Utit-Khent , but , of course , this name , Mistress of Expeditions , ' was only an army joke . He was said to have a rectum like the mouth of a bucket . So I knew again my Pharaoh 's anger . He would have me share a chariotwith such a man . Of course , He was now listening to the advice of His son . So soon as He discovered the power of my thoughts to reach into the thoughts of our enemy , so might I be His driver again . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever a way I began to laugh for , lo , he pointed out there were Gods for every fish and cat , and the God of beetles was a Great God , but no God ever bothered to inhabit the dust . You could not name such a God . He was harmless , this General , a clown for other Generals , he commanded no men , and had been a flunky for Prince Amen-khep-shu-ef , but I had to wonder if this poor Utit-Khent had once been a strong soldier but had grown weak serving the father of Usermare . Maybe , that Pharaoh Seti had held him by the hair . " We were not on a bad trail , indeed it was more like a road wide enough for one chariot to pass another . That was comfortable and it was cool in the forest under the heat of midday , but none of us were comfortable  --  Kadesh was too near . Besides , you had to wonder where a squadron of chariots could strike at us . While the forest reached to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an army could hide at their edge . Five thousand men could charge down on five hundred , yet now my good King , impatient at delay , did not bother anymore to send out scouts . He must have believed the gates to Kadesh were open . " Into the early afternoon we traveled , and passed another wood , and many a cultivated field , even saw a farmer or two who ran off at the sight of us , but we kept moving with the Orontes at our right , and the river was shallow here and slow-moving , and had several fords wide enough for an army , if this was where Metella wished to attack from the other bank . Still , nothing happened , and we came around a turn in our road and saw before us , there in full view to the north , the walls and towers of Kadesh , and no Hittite army was drawn up in front of it . There was nothing before us but the river which wound around its walls to the left . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many days on the Nile and in the desert and the mountains , that I think my good King could not stop , not yet , but must keep going while He passed the city on our right hand . Soon , the walls would be behind us , and here , as if confused by the absence of any soldiers , or even any face in the windows of the towers of Kadesh , in this silence of the hills where the largest sound was the groaning of our chariot wheels , not a large sound , for we hardly strained on the level ground , Ramses the Second finally gave the order , and in a thin wood with many small fields and scattered trees , we halted beside the river in a place too steep to cross . The three open sides to our square that looked out on the land were quickly faced off with our shields , and an earthworksto support the shields was begun by the Nubians right aboutp335the Pharaoh 's pavilion . Here we waited in silence , no sound but the digging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger square around our square , which enabled the King 's Guard to move back from the Orontes . Now , the Division of Amon had the river for a fourth side . There was still not a sound from the town . " Around us you could hear the echo of the five thousand men of Amon digging away , although with no great effort . In another hour we might be moving again . So they carried on with the ease of men unharnessing their horses , feeding their beasts and their own mouths , and in all this unyoking of the provision trains , there was a feeling of safety at the size of our numbers . Only I felt oppressed in my breath . Even though I did not want to fight beside Utit-Khent , still I worked on the chariot I might yet have to ride with him , grinding the bronze rim of the wheels with a rare hard stone I carried in my leather bag until the edge was sharp as a knife . That would not last for long , but , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the body of a fallen man . All the while , I continued to feel heavy in my lungs . When we came to this camping ground , I had seen no sign of another army , no litter whatsoever , and the red pine needles of the forest floor were smooth . Yet they did not look smooth so much as swept back into order . I had the feeling an army had been here before us , even this morning , and wondered how easily pine needles could conceal their traces . Besides , I could smell the God of the pine trees and He was almost as strange as the God who came with the myrrh from Punt . " Men kept coming to the Pharaoh 's Pavilion with little pieces of equipment . Here was a wagon-spoke unfamiliar to us , or a brokenleather cinch with a strange-smelling oil . More and more did a sentiment become powerful to me that the forest was stale . Then I thought if I were Metella , yes , I would stay on this north side of Kadesh well hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south . Only when He came up to the walls , would I cross the river to the east and hide on the other side to keep the city between us . Then , if He came even farther north to this place , so would I move altogether to the south and still be hidden by the walls of Kadesh . That way I could cross the river in the place where there were many fords and strike into the middle of the Division of Ra , there in that open field south of the city . " Even as I was considering such maneuvers , an outcry began in our camp . Two Asiatics had just been brought in by scouts , their faces covered with blood . Soldiers in the middle of cooking a mealp336stared as the captors led these prisoners to the Pavilion of the Pharaoh . Then came many screams and the sound of the flail . By the time I entered the King 's tent , the backs of the prisoners were as bloody as their features , and I was glad I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flail whipped loose a piece of skin large as your palm . Usermare-Setpenere now pulled off a strip from the prisoner'sshoulder like a ribbon of papyrus , and threw it to the ground . Then He said : Speak the truth . ' That Hittite could not have known a word of our language , but he knew the voice , he knew the eyes that looked at him . The light from those eyes was as full of flame as the sun . So to Usermare-Setpenere , by way of Utit-Khent , he said , 0 Son of Ra , spare my back . ' " Where is your miserable King of the Hittites ? ' " Behold , ' cried the Asiatic in his language , and behold ' said our **26;11298;TOOLONG in our language , Metella the King of Kadesh has gathered many nations in great numbers . His soldiers cover the mountains and valleys . ' " He continued to speak even as Amen-khep-shu-ef was twistingthis man 's arm behind his neck . I thought his shoulder would dislocate , for even the bleeding stopped , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scout said it all , every word , waitingeach few words for Utit-Khent to express what he had said , all the while swallowing his groans . Now , Usermare-Setpenere raised His sword . Where is Metella now ? ' " He could hold out no longer : O my Lord , Metella is waiting on the other bank of the river . ' " I thought the sword would fall . It hovered . Instead , our King let go of the Hittite , and turned to us . See what you have told Me , ' He cried out , see how you have spoken of the King of Kadesh as a coward who flees . ' Now I thought He would take the sword to His son . The Prince struck His head to the ground seven times , and must have had many thoughts , for when He looked up , He said , My Lord , let Me ride back to tell the Division of Ptah . We will need them . ' When our King gave a slow nod , as if forced to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent , and at once , I suppose , on His way , , although none of us were able to know what another did , for in the next moment , chaos fell upon us . I heard a far-off din , a nearer uproar , and then the voice of a hundred horses , a most fearful clamor , a pandemonium , the shock and crash of chariots . We did not know that the shattered legions of the Division of Ra ,  |p337horses  without chariots and charioteers without horses , were now running our way , infantrymen chasing wagon trains pulled at a gallop by horses without drivers , and all of this disorder came down on us . Only later would I learn that the Division of Ra had been cut in half even as I had foreseen it , there in the road where they were long indeed like a worm . Now the rear of Ra was running back to the Division of Ptah , and the front half was on us in their rout , some already falling under the first chariots of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shields and earthworks of the outer square of Amon . The armies of Metella , like a serpent of the Very Green , had washed right up to the shore on which we stood . In this clamor , we saw the sky become as dark as the metal in an infantryman 's dagger . "  | " I COULD tell you , " said Menenhetet to our Pharaoh , and tomy mother and father , " of how we spoke of this battle later , when each man could tell it to his own advantage . Then , it was only by comparing the lies that you could begin to look for the truth . But that was later . At this moment , there was nothing but noise , and much confusion . Yet I do not find it hard to remember how I felt through all of that long afternoon to follow when so many of us were nearer to the dead than the living , because I never felt so alive . I can still see the spear that passes to the left of my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  it is as near to me as falling from my bed in a dream  --  I am thrown out from the Pharaoh 's Chariot by the shock of a lance against my shield . It was the greatest battle of all wars , and in my four lives I never heard of anything like it . Of course , my mind did not speak to me on that day as on others , and it is true that the most unusual moments and the most unimportant passed equally like separate strangers , but I remember that in the instant when the clamor first beat about our camp , Usermare-Setpenere turned to me , and said , Take your shield and ride in My Chariot , ' and I who had dreamed of this moment down the Nile , in the dust of Gaza , and through the mysteries of Tyre , could only nod my head and think that the work I had spent in sharpening the wheels of the chariot of UtitKhentwas work worse than lost , for Utit-Khent would probably cut his own leg off falling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle where events become as shattered as broken rocks whose pieces fly in all directions , so I was seeing fragments of what was yet to happen , and Utit-Khent certainly did fall out of his chariot , and his leg was mangled by the wheel I sharpened even as his horses in panic ran over him . " As I say , all I could feel at the instant was that 1 must nowp339find my leather bag and my stone and begin to sharpen the wheels of His Chariot . But even to have such a thought was stupid . A squad of soldiers  --  the Royal Guard of the Chariot-of-the MightyBull  --  were forever polishing the gold and silver filigree , and workingmany royal stones on the treads  --  you could lose your finger running it along His wheels . So I climbed up instead on the cage of the lion to get a better view of all that was happening about us . Immediately , Hera-Ra started roaring beneath like a drunken beggar , hooking at his cage so furiously I almost fell off . Standing on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulders and head , while I looked in all four directions , my organs in an uproar to match a confusion of sights multitudinous as the foam of the Very Green . I could certainly see the King 's square surrounded on all four sides , for the larger square built in such haste by the soldiers of Amon was now lost . Beyond our square was a chaos and a carnage . The Division of Amon were fleeing their meals , their games , their tents , their wagon trains and their animals . While our inside square stood fast for the Pharaoh , outside I could see no more than a few of ours to face hordes of Hittites overrunning us so quickly they were caught already in their own rush . These Asiatics were not riding in one careful rank behind another of charioteersin perfect order the way we Egyptians like to advance , no , just a mob of hundreds of chariots , three men in each , wearing odd yellow hats , nor did they fight with bow and sword but tried to run everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariots , at least those still fighting , kept weaving in and out , our charioteers , some even at this hour with the reins around their waist , were pulling bows , quick as sparrows fighting boars . The enemy was so big and clumsy that I even saw two Hittite chariots crash into each other , three men in one catapulted out even as the other three were hurled to the ground . Yet over every hill , through these thin woods , came more ranks of Hittite chariots , some at a run , some at a walk , and then I saw the nearest thirty or forty , maybe a squadron , riding at a gallop toward the King 's square itself . They charged our breastworks , up and over , and nearly all spilled . Those who did not , landed among the strongest of the Pharaoh 's Sherdens who seized these Asiatic horses by the bridle , and held their footing long enough to turn the horses ' necks and halt the chariot , at which moment , other Sherdens ripped the horses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hittites . Of the thirty who charged into our square , not one was left , and I , like a boy quick with excitement onp340the cage of Hera-Ra , had only an instant to see that the Pharaoh , His head down , His eyes closed , was still praying . Out of His mouth I heard these words : In the Year Five of My Reign , third month of the third season , on this Day Nine of Epiphi , under the majesty of Horus , I , Ramses Meri-Amon , the Mighty Bull , Beloved of Maat , King of Upper and Lower Egypt , Son of Ra Who am given life forever '  --  so I heard Him call on all His names , and even as a shaduf lifts its pail of water up the hill , so was my Pharaoh pumping up His blood as though the very water of the Land of the Dead must be lifted into His heart until He feared no death , and the dead as well as the living would listen : Who am mighty in valor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limbs like fire '  --  so He kept speaking while on the battleground of woods and fields outside our square I saw a horse go over backward with an arrow in its neck , down on its own chariot with its own three Hittites , and one of our charioteers with a short spear in his chest fell forward onto the shaft between his two horses . On their backs , everywhere , were dead men staring at the sky . The nearest was farther away than I could throw a stone , yet , brilliant as a bird 's eye was his eye . I could see it . Near him lay another dead man clutching his genitals . Then I saw a man whose arm was caught in the hub of a chariot wheel , and a Hittite came along and hacked at his head with an axe . All the while , most of our army was running into the woods . I could not believe in what panic were the men of Amon . " Now my Pharaoh had finished praying and He unhooked the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my surprise , Usermare-Setpenere leaped into His Chariot on the driver 's side . I , thereby , to the other , and He rode in a circle through our square , nearly striking some of our own men as He called , We are going to attack . We are going to attack . ' " Six chariots , seven , now eight , followed in our circle . Others saluted but did not move until the next time around . Now others joined , but not enough . " Follow Me , ' said Usermare-Setpenere , and with a force of twenty chariots , He rode at full speed to the southern side of our square , choosing the lowest place in the earth wall , and we drove over it and down the other side , banging against one another badly ; but then we were on the field , Hittite chariots before us in every direction , and , when I dared to look behind , half of our force was still with us . The other half had not dared to make it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak in such a wayp341when our Pharaoh , having pumped the courage of the dead into every one of His limbs , not to speak of the force of Strength-ofThebesand Maat-is-Satisfied , fastest horses of any land , and HeraRabounding at our side , his roars louder than an avalanche of rock down a cliff , were , all of us , galloping through every bewilderment of battle so fast that none , not even our own men , could keep up with us , although some tried . The Hittites parted before our passage , as well as any poor Egyptians from Amon or Ra whom we passed , and for the length of a field , through a wood , and down another field , not one arrow was shot at us , not one did we shoot , and no Hittite came near , not man nor chariot  --  perhaps they were all afraid of the brilliance of the chariot of Usermare-Setpenere and the face of Hera-Ra , bounding beside us . " Behind , like a tail that becomes so stretched the end must pull off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up with the Pharaoh over rough ground , and only a few stayed with us now . When I dared to look , for I felt as if my good life depended on keeping eyes to the front , I could see how some of our men were surrounded by Hittites , and some had turned back , or were fighting their way back , and still my Ramses the Second galloped south , no one more happy , nobody so brave , nobody so handsome  --  He looked as if the sun shone out of His eyes . We 'll break through , ' He shouted , and find the troops of Ptah . We 'll kill these fools when we come back , ' and with that , we met a hundred Hittite chariots waiting in the next field . " Now I saw more battle than a man could fight . Never will I be certain how many of our chariots were still with us , if any . For when our Ramses drove with His golden vehicle full-force into the center of these heavy Hittite carts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few minutes I saw whole . So I saw the spear that came at my shield and the axe that just missed my head . I saw Hera-Ra leap across three men of one chariot onto the horses of another . I saw him hanging upside-down with his muzzle on a horse 's neck . Hidden from the arrows of the Hittite charioteers , he clung to the horse , his jaw on the blood of the stallion 's throat , the claws of his hind legs opening the belly , until the horse stood up in such extremity of pain that his mate stood up too , both screaming , and they fell backward on their drivers , even as Hera-Ra leaped from the horse to a man and bit off an arm , or most of an arm , I could not believe what I saw , all from the side of my eye , between the movements of my shield , a hundred arrows seeming to come atp342once , all at the Pharaoh , as if no one could think of the horses nor of me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not the ones I blocked . They came at us hard as birds flying full tilt into a wall , and their points came through the leather of my shield , evil as the nose of your enemy . " All the while , Ramses the Second would draw His bow and loose an arrow at full gallop , swerve by one Hittite chariot , then another , and was so adept we could stop , wheel , then charge away to stop short again as chariots converged on ours . Your sword , ' He shouted , and there , not moving , two of us against three on either side , we fought back to back with our swords against their six axes , only it was not so unequal as that , for Hera-Ra charged one chariot , then another , and with such bloody fury that others did not come near , and we were free again , we had , so we thought , so we shouted to each other , only to find another hundred Hittites facing us in still another phalanx . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we were not always alone , but five times we fought like this , five times we drove into a mass of men and horses so thick the only forest you saw was swords , armor , axes , horses , limbs , and chariots turning over . Vehicles raced by empty of riders , and ran into one another . The trees quivered . Ramses ' great bow , which nobody but He could draw , had a force to drive its arrow through a man so hard it could knock him from the chariot to the ground , yet these sights I saw in fragments like the eye of a face on the shard of a pot . So , for instance , did I see a Hittite hold up a man who was expiring in the flood of a wound , while two others galloped away in a chariot withoutreins . The third Hittite had fallen off already . Many a soldier was trampled by horses or run over by wheels  --  I saw so many of those Hittite wheels with their eight spokes that I dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels puckered as a strange anus , and there were sights full of folly : I even saw a Hittite attacking his own horse in harness ; such was the fever that the fellow killed the beast with his axe . Maybe it had tried to run him down . I did not know , I never saw more , I was ducking a blow , sticking a lance , or reeling from the impact of the Pharaoh 's body against me when He slammed our horses through a sharp turn , once I even fell off , landed on my feet and jumped up again . My lungs knew the fire of the Gods . I saw Hera-Ra leap at three men who stood motionless inp343their chariot , transfixed by the loss of their horses . They were still looking at their useless reins as he clawed down on them . " Loose horses were everywhere . I saw one on broken front legs , trying to rear , and a charioteer lay on the ground , holding the tail of this horse until the animal flopped around to bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his horses walking in stupor with loose reins . Then the man fainted , and I saw him slide to the ground . To the other flank was a riderless horse trying to crawl into a fallen chariot . It was a madness . One pair of horses , stripped of all three men , tried to dash over a collision of other chariots , but stumbled , and the empty chariot catapulted overhead while the horses stampeded into the ground . I never heard such a scream come from animals before . The worst was a howl from a steed Usermare-Setpenerestruck in the chest with an arrow when it tried to leap betweenour stallion and mare . Everywhere , beasts in panic were defecating as they ran . On it went . We would think we had broken through the Hittites only to see another phalanx to the south , and we would attack again , even break through , but on the sixth attempt , we saw a thousand Hittites coming toward us in orderly formation . " It ca n't be done , ' I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at me then as if I were the worst coward ever seen , and said , Strengthen your heart . I will lay them in the dust ! ' I looked at those thousand soldiers and at my King 's face , and in it was the expressionI have seen in the eyes of mad beggars when they believe they are sons of the Pharaoh , yes , my Ramses the Second could swear to destroy all who called themselves Hittites , and I could feel His certaintyso powerfully that I believed in it myself , although in a different way , and I said , Let us return , my King , to Your Pavilion , and we will gather Your troops and fight and destroy these Hittites from there , ' and on that word , He wheeled our horses and we went charging back to the north , back to the remnants of the King 's square that was two hills , three fields , and I do not know how many small woods away . " There were enemy everywhere , and none of our chariots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were all too busy plundering the deserted camp of the Division of Amon . So we swept back into the King 's square and heard the cheers of all the men who were left . Officers came running forward as we halted , telling in great excitement how they had defended our square by the northp344side , the south side , the west and even by the river until the Hittites had retreated  --  with all their thousands , they had failed to take the square  --  but Ramses listened with wrath . To hear of their exploits , you would have thought we had none of our own , yet the arrows were still sticking in the quilting of our horses and the face of HeraRawas more red with the blood of the Hittites than the chest of a man laid open with a sword . I could not believe how red was the brightness of blood when you saw a great deal of it . " Menenhetet paused . " In what I have told you , there is not the heart of what I truly felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tried to break through to the south , I had been like a God , I felt twice my size  --  even as They are twice our height  --  and I was four times my strength , even as Gods know the power of four arms for each of Their shoulders . Never had I been so tireless in so heavy a work , and never was my breath so close to Them . I could have fought through the afternoon and night with the love I knew for Ramses and the horses and all that came forth from how we moved together . Often as not , I had no more than to think of a quick turn to the left for my King to perform the move , and , as if given vision in the back of my head , knew to swing my shield when a flight of arrows came down on us , never did I know as in those moments that we live for Them to see us , see us well , and thereby let us feel like Gods ourselves . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet , at least so long as the Gods were with me , yet I lost them in the instant I saw the chariots of the thousand Hittites , except I do not know if I really did , for I was not full of fear when I saw that frightening sight , merely cool and calm and tired , my arm was suddenly heavy , and the voice that spoke to me was the same God 's voice I heard in the flame of the hottest combat , still the same voice now said in my ear , Do not let this fool attack , or you are both dead , ' and I say to You that the voice was amused  --  it is the word  --  It was amused , yet so fine and quiet a voice I could swear I did not hear from Amon with His mighty tongue but the soft tone of Osiris Himself . Who else would dare to speak of my Pharaoh as a fool ? Only the Lord Osiris Who gave me the advice to return quickly to the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I am the son of Amon , it is Osiris who saved me today . ' " Now we were back in the middle of the Household Guard , and in the joy of our return , so did I feel the strength of the Gods once more . My height doubled again , at least to myself , and I de/sired combat so much I felt the swelling of my member , and did not know whether to laugh or cry out in exultation . I saw Hera-Ra bounding about , licking our soldiers ' faces with his bloody face , and mighty for a cat was his member , also fully extended , he was one in good spirits with me . I do not know if it was the blood on the field , or the jubilation of these troops that they had held their square , maybe it was the early fermentation of the dead bodies around us before their seven souls and spirits had begun to depart , but I can only say that the air in our nostrils was like a rose at evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rose , just so fine smelled the air with our desire for new combat . I thought again of my mother 's story at how she awoke at my father 's side and a God brilliant in the gold of His breastplate was above her , and the hut was filled with a perfume lovelier than any she had ever smelled . " Now I knew what she had known , and it was equal to the tender odor of this air , and whether we owed it to Amon or Osiris , I could hardly say , but I was moved to climb onto the cage of Hera-Ra , and this so pleased him that he , in turn , walked with humorousthumps of his paws into the space beneath where he began to purr . Only then did I look out to all four sides , and the Hittites with their thousand chariots and a thousand more behind were walking their horses toward us in two great semicircles coming in from the west and the south . To our north was devastation . All of Amon and Ra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abandoned chariots , shattered tents , and provision wagons being plundered now by the Hittites on the field . The wisdom of Osiris must still have been with me , for I whispered to my King , At the east by the river , the line of Asiatics is thin . ' It was true  --  fewer Hittites were there than on any of the other sides of our square , indeed the river was not two hundred paces away , and so He , addingthe force of Amon to the mind of Osiris , shouted to the brave Household troops on all our four fronts , Come with Me . To the river ! ' Leaving our flanks and rear unprotected , Ramses mounted His Chariot and we took off at a gallop , followed by our remaining chariots , and foot soldiers from all four sides . " There were not fifty steps from our line of shields on the east side to their line , and we crossed before you could blink three times . That was just as well since I never saw so many arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , these Hittites by the river had been somnolent , as desultory in shooting at us , as we at them . So long as arrows went hack and forth from one entrench/ment to another , you collected what fell , and soon the arrows you returned to the Hittites were sent back again . All the same , I was amazed at the number that now came at us as we galloped across . I heard foot soldiers cry out as they were struck , and then in the full shock of combat , for so it is , full shock , we slammed into the shields before us , and our good horses , Maat and Thebes , took us up over the earthworks of the Hittites , and we came down on their chariots with all our own chariots behind us . " I do not know what it is like to fall into a river and be dashed over rocks . Since I can not swim , I will never know , except I do , for the golden chariot of my King , stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Hittite chariots at once . With nine men , six horses , and three heavy carts did we collide , and all four of the vehicles went over I think , it is certain we did . I remember striking the ground and the King with me , and our chariot coming over on us , its wheel , much blunted now , still scoring my back , then we were bouncing up and the horses were trumpeting , and even as I was coming off the ground , so His Chariot was up again as well , 1 do not know how unless it kept tumbling with the horses , it was His , after all , and we jumped on once more , and rode in a circle , firing arrows into the Hittites . With it all , these collisions , bumps , falls , and recoveries had been happening as slowly as you would slide down a mountain in a dream . Never had I had as much time to arrange my body for each new shock , nor been this quick with my feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was nothing like the maneuvers we had practiced for years , no orderly sweep of rank on rank , no herding of infantry into a corner , no , we were in a rush to drive them to the river and fast , very fast , before other Hittites overran the King 's square we had just left . Maybe it was the desperation of where we were , no front , no rear , no flanks , and probably no King 's Pavilion to return to , but we fought like HeraRa , and so great was our lust to win a victory on this dreadful day that we were forever jumping in and out of our chariots , Ramses and I often fighting back to back , and many a soldier we wounded , and more than a few we killed , and back to our chariot against new Hittites . Everywhere I could see our vehicles circling their heavy carts with our skillful turns . On the ground , the Nubians were impalingHittites with their short spears . I saw a man bite the nose off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow sash turn red . Three Hittites galloped by , and one of them had an axe in hisp347hand and an arrow in his buttocks . He kept looking backward as if to see who had bitten him . " We drove them all into the river . Foot soldiers , chariots , charioteers , even their Princes . It was fierce , but our swords were strong , our desperation was the virtue of war itself , and snorting , sobbing , growling at each other , charioteers on foot and infantrymen so crazed they leaped up on loose horses , we fought them to the edge of the embankment of the river , and then one Hittite chariot went over , down the bank and into the stream , a scream , a splash , they were washing away . Speak of rock and a rapid river , the river was narrow here and deep , and downstream a rapids began with many rocks . The first chariot to go shattered on those rocks , and I heard water swallow up the middle of a man 's cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these Hittites matched our own , but we were close to a triumph here and our soldiers were berserk . Since we had overrun their campfires , some of us seized burning branches and hurled them , and I even saw a Sherden swinging a leg of half-cooked beef , and Hittites fought back with torches , and with daggers , and sword against sword , and axe against sword . We pushed them all in , every last man who had not fallen on the field , and the few who clung to the slope of the wet and precipitous bank were struck in the face with arrows , although one of our Nubians was so emblazoned by now with the heat of battle that he slid down the bank to push a Hittite in , and failed . Both men drowned instead , biting at each other , arms around each other 's throats . " What a sight ! We stood at the riverbank and cheered , breathlessand sobbing we cheered . It sounded like the demented wails you hear in a funeral procession , and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would ever see again . A horse was swimming downstream with a Hittite trying to climb its back , and falling off , and trying again until he slipped off and drowned , but the horse reached the other bank , and other Hittites pulled the animalout of the water . There was a Prince washed up next , that I knew by his purple raiment , and the Hittites held him upside-down until I could not believe the liquid that poured out of the man 's throat , and later I heard he was the Prince of Aleppo , no less . So I saw royalty held by its heels , and then my eye flew to another Hittitewho was sinking . Clearly I saw him wave farewell to the land as he went under the water , and another man swept by right heneathme , his arms around his horse 's neck as if he would kiss thep348creature , and he was speaking to his animal , I heard him weep with love before the rocks struck him and the horse . Behind him went a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrow in his belly . I even saw one soldier make it with his animal to the other bank , and crawl ashore and lie there dying from a wound . As he expired , his horse licked his hand . " Then we saw the Hittites come out on the other bank of the river . Out of the woods they emerged , too far for any of our arrows to reach , and I , practiced at making a quick count of a hundred men in a field , or a thousand , here saw something like eight thousand . I was happy they were on the other side of the river at this place where there was no ford , though I must say so soon as our Ramses saw them , that was equal to destroying His pleasure at what we had gained , whatever it was . " Attack again , ' He cried . To the west . ' " I never knew if my King was wise in battle , but then wisdom is a word by which one judges a man not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His command was followed . Instead He charged back over the old camping ground that lay within the entrenchment of our four sides , and everywhere were plundering Hittites , their backs to us and their faces to the ground . Like maggots on meat , they were as blind . The fools were so hungry for spoil they had stopped short of bearing down on us from the rear while we were at the river . Instead , they attacked our riches . Two hundred of them were ransacking the King 's Pavilion when we came back . We set fire to them there . In that way I could never understand my Pharaoh . No one loved His treasures more than Himself , yet so great was His heat in battle that He was the first to pick up a burning log and throw it on His tents , and a hundred of us added to the blaze , indeed our chariots ran a relay from the campfire to the fine stuff of His tent itself . Its walls were now collapsing upon the Hittitesplundering within , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolen capes on fire , even their groins on fire , our Nubians met them with short clubs , and cracked the heads of these fools on fire , twice fools for they died with the plunder in their arms . The stink of the leather of the King 's burning tents was even worse than the odor of burning flesh . Yet the smell was like a marrow to give us blood for the battle . I felt vigor in my sword , as if even the metal could know exhaustion and look for new spirit . " We destroyed the Hittites in the King 's Pavilion and came down like a scourge on the petty plunder of the wagon trains . Wep349took back our four sides and were a square again . Again , we gave a cheer . The two semicircles of Asiatic chariots who had been advancingupon us at a walk now stopped some hundreds of paces from our lines . They , too , were busy at plundering , but it was their own infantrymen they stripped . For those soldiers were still picking up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hittite chariots scourged them like big animals eating little animals . " Now the King 's Pavilion was down . Its leather was consumed . White ashes lay on the ground , and some still glowed . My Ramses said , Who will bring Me our God ? ' and the Captain of the Nubians pointed his finger at one of his blacks , a giant of a man with a huge belly , something in build like Amon Himself , and the black stepped into the hot ash and ran to the middle of the fallen tents , picked up the blackened statue  --  may I say it took all his strength  --  and staggered out . Given its weight , the Nubian had to hold it against his body , and his breast was burned , and his belly , his hands , his forearms and his feet , yet once he had set the God down by my King 's feet , so did Usermare-Setpenere kiss him , kiss this black  --  what honor could be so great as for a black to be kissed by the Pharaoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the tenderest voice began to speak to Him , talking only of His great love equal to the rapture of the sky at evening , and He took one end of His skirt and wiped all that was black from the God 's face , kissing the God on the lips even though His own mouth blossomed at once into two great blisters which He wore in combat . A frighteningsight it made , for now He could only speak out of the swollen rope of His upper and lower lips . " I would have wondered at the power of the black to bear such pain , and even the love for Amon that would lead my Pharaoh to seek such pain , but at that moment a broken feather flew loose from the headdress of Maat-is-Satisfied and drifted to my feet . When I picked it up , the feather was heavy with the blood and grime of battle and moved in my hand like a knife , it had weight . I knew enough to kiss it . So soon as I did , a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , lo , I , too , was now to fight with white and swollen blisters upon my lips . " Can I tell You of the rest of the day ? Our battle , You remember , had begun under a dull and heavy sky . In that gloom , so strange to our Egyptian eyes , the sweat was cold on our bodies whenever we paused for breath , and our thirst was dry and cold and as desperatein our throats as our situation itself . Now it was easier , andp350as the Hittites came back into formation from plundering each other , and began to attack us , so were we also stronger . The Army of Amon that had deserted us was coming back from where they had fled , and many a skirmish was fought between these returning soldiersand the Hittites . Seeing the desire of such lost troops to make their way back to our square , my King , to help them , rode forth any times with our charioteers of the Household Guard on either side . Five times we rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less each time for now we knew that the first of our advantages were the bows . Our arrows flew farther and so we did not have to crash against their heavier vehicles , but would stop short and send off as many arrows as we could afford , and pick up those that came back . The Hittites were hurt in this combat . Many of their horses , struck by us , would drive their other chariots amok with confusion , and often they were forced to retreat . On these scenes , the skies parted , and the Sun was revealed . We were warm in the late afternoon and grew stronger . It was then my Pharaoh lost all sense of how much we were outnumbered . Without a word to any but myself , out of the very warmth He felt from the Sun , and the burn on His mouth , with the reins hardly flogging our good horses , and Maat and Thebes no longer horses to me , but giants , may I say , in the bodies of horses this day , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such a speed that we came to where they had put up the tent of the Hittite leaders , and in that place , before their phalanxes , alone with me again , my King approached their flags and standards . We were all but surrounded by a circle of the Asiatics ' chariots . Hera-Ra roared at them with such fury that I think each enemy was afraid to draw his bow for fear the lion might attack his face alone . I do not know why they did not charge , but there was peace for this moment on the battleground as if no one could move , and even Hera-Ra was silent at last . " I am with Amon in the great battle , ' said Ramses the Second , and when all is lost , so will He cause them to see Me as the two mighty arms of Amon who are Horus and Set . I am the Lord of Light , ' and He raised His sword until the sun glittered upon it , and then jumped down from His chariot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lion , ' He commanded me , and He waited , sword in hand , until I tethered Hera-Ra to our chariot . Then He held up the forefinger of His hand as a way of saying He wanted to fight their best soldier.  | " From the Hittite leaders came forth a Prince with a terrible face . His beard was lean , and one eye was as flat as a stone , the other was bright . He , too , was dismounted , and in the moment Usermare saw him , I think my King was not at ease . " They began to fight . The Hittite was fast and his movements were quicker than my Good and Great God . If this Prince had been as strong with his blade as my King , it would have ended soon , but Usermare attacked with such force that the other went back in a circle away from His great arm . Still , the Hittite 's parries blocked the sword of the Sun from above and below , and now , given the chance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's leg . He limped now , and moved more slowly , and the look in His eye was not good . He breathed like a horse . I could not believe it  --  the sword of the Hittite grew bolder . Soon he began to attack , and my Lord retreat . The weight of all these hours of fighting was on His mouth , and , then , fending an overhead blow from the Prince , my Ramses ' nose was broken by His own shield . I thought He was lost , and it may be that He was , but the end of the fight was interrupted . For the lion had become so agitated that I had to cut him loose from the tether or he would have turned on the horses . " The Hittite , seeing the beast bound toward him , lost no time running back to his own people , and , Usermare , much fatigued , leaned on His sword . The lion licked His face . A sound like the bellowing of hippopotami came forth from the Hittites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood . If . so , we were done . Usermare might not have the strength to lift His sword , and then the lion and I would be alone . Yet at that moment , a Hittite trumpetblew . I heard a call for their retreat . Now , to my astonishment , they moved out quickly , leaving their royal tent behind . " I was certain of a trap . I could not believe they would leave such spoils for us . Not when they were so strong . Yet in the next moment , I saw their reason . The Division of Ptah had come on to the field at last . The phalanxes of its chariots were moving up fast from the south . So the Hittites were now in a rush to reach the gates of Kadesh before Ptah crossed the line of their retreat . We had been left alone on the field. " 1 think my King had a vision then . It was other sights He saw . I can only tell you that He staggered across to the abandoned tent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the God of these Asiatics , and had great furled wings , and the face , not of a bull , but of a beautiful man with a long Syrian beard . It also hadp352the pointed ears of a monster , and a castle in the shape of a tower was its hat . I had never seen a God like this . He was screaming now , in some harsh language of the Asiatics , a hideous host of lamentations , and must have been naming all the larger catastrophes , locusts and boils for being deserted by His troops . In truth , it was the most horrible voice I ever heard . It spoke through the blistered lips of my Pharaoh , the oaths resounding in Usermare 's throat until He threw the God to the ground . Whereupon fumes came from the mouth , yes , from the golden mouth of this bull-beast came smoke , I swear it . I did not know how my Pharaoh could be called the Mighty Bull of Amon , yet here before us was another bull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was then I saw the face of the secret whore of Kadesh . It was her features I saw on the winged bull , a beautiful woman 's face with a beard . So I knew that the cries of this voice came from Metella 's God . We were hearing His agony that the battle was lost . Maybe it is in war that you come to the place where the rainbow touches the earth , and much that has been hidden is simple . "  | " WITH the departure of the Hittites , the fields were empty . We were alone , as I say , and Hera-Ra raised his head and gave a lonely cry . It was a sound of much confusion as if the animal did not know whether we were victorious or desolate . In the distance I could see the legions of Ptah give up their attempt to reach the gates of Kadesh before the Hittites . They wheeled instead toward the King 's square . Yet my Pharaoh disdained to raise an arm to greet them . We returned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured cry and more than a few of the dying to give us a cheer . One fellow even managed to make a sound with his head half off . You saw nothing but the hole in his neck out of which he seemed to speak . My Pharaoh , however , ignored the pandemonium with which our soldiers cheered and as we came through the openingof our square , He drove to the ruins of His Pavilion in silence . He did not dismount . " Even as His officers came toward us , bowing , then crawling forward on their knees , so did He speak only to the horses . You , ' He said , are My great horses . It is you who rode with Me to repulsethe nations , and you were under My hand when I was alone with the enemy . ' If there had been sparks when He struck the sword of others in combat , now there was flame in His eye as He looked at His officers . They did not even dare to beat their heads to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , are My champions in the hour of danger . Let them know a place of honor in My stables , and let their food be given to them when I am fed . ' Now , He stepped down from His Chariot and caressed each of their noses . They gave an answer in voices full of pleasure . Their feathers were in shreds and their hides were red , their legs shivered in fatigue , but they called forth a thanks to Him . Then my Ramses heard the voice of l lis officers.  | " 0 Great Warrior , ' they cried out . It was a babble , however , of one hundred names of praise in six or seven languages , and all in a rush . 0 Twice-a-Great-House , ' they cried , You have saved Your Army . There is no King that fights like You . ' " You , ' He said to them in return , did not join Me . I do not remember the names of those who are not beside Me when I am in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My shield , ' and He put His arm about me , and patted my buttock as if I were a horse . Look , ' He said to all those officers . With My sword I have struck down thousands , and multitudes have fallen before Me . Millionshave been repulsed . ' " They all cheered , " said my great-grandfather . " Some had fought , and some had even fought a lot . Many were bloody with their wounds . Yet they listened in shame and lowered their heads and when the Generals of the Division of Ptah came forward to greet our Monarch at this reunion , He did not thank them for savingthe day , nor reward His son Amen-khep-shu-ef for the rigors of that ride to join the legions of Ptah , but only remarked , What will Amon say when He hears that Ptah left Me alone on this great day ? I slaughtered the enemy beneath My wheels but other chariots were not there , and neither was My infantry . I , and I alone , was the tempest against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolation worse than the swords of the Hittites was being felt . His officers touched the ground , they struck their heads , they lamented . I , in the most peculiar of positions , also bowed , but out of caution , and tried to keep from smiling . I thought that perhaps I was in error and should , unlike the others , remain standing so that my King should never mistake me for them , and I wondered if His mind had not taken a wrench from the screams of that Asiatic God who roared out of His throat . I did not know , but my King was soon silent and sat by Himself , alone by the blackened statue of Amon , and with the linen of His own skirt cleaned the soot from the belly and limbs of Amon , and pressed His forehead to the golden brow in a long embrace . " We surrounded Him in silence . We waited . As the gold of the late afternoon lowered with the sun , and evening was near , He said , Tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' By these words the officers knew they might speak to Him again . " Yet , I know He lifted His head from the brow of Amon with the greatest regret . So long as He sat with His forehead touching the golden forehead of the Great God , so did He see a sunset behindp355I its closed eyes and feel the peace of our Egyptian wisdom enter I Iis mind and pass into the scourged flesh of His throat and mouth . I could not believe it but when He looked up , the blisters were gone from His lips . ( They still remained on mine . ) So I could see that in all the splendor of the pure gold out of which Amon was made , there was also balm as cool as dew . What merits in this metal of the Sun ! " Soon , the counting of the hands was begun . We used to lay the hands of thieves in a heap outside the gate of the palace , even as we do now , but , in that time of Ramses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after battle . Usermare-Setpenere stood in His Chariot and soldiers came forward in a line from the Householdtroops to be followed by the soldiers of Amon . Many hundreds , then thousands of these soldiers passed one by one before the Pharaohon this night even though we did not know yet if all of the battle had taken place or it was only the first day . Metella still had his infantry and his chariots , and both were inside the gates of Kadesh . They might come out tomorrow . So we could not say whether we had won or must get ready for the dawn . But the field where we fought this afternoon was ours for tonight , and that is like having another man 's woman . She may go back to him tomorrow , but no one can tell you tonight that you have lost . So the longer this eveningwent on , the more it became a night of pleasure . As if in contempt for that enemy who had gone behind his walls , we lit so many campfires that the field was scarlet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunset on one of those miraculous evenings when night itself still hovers , or so it seems , on the last , and then the very last , and then beyond the last light of evening and nobody loses their shadow . So was our field luminous on this night , and the light came from that part of the sun which entered the trees in their youth , and now came forth again while the wood was ablaze . " All through the night , our fires burned , and through the same night , Usermare-Setpenere stood in His Chariot under a full moon and received the severed hands of the slain Hittites one by one . Since He spoke to no one but the soldier who came before Him on His right hand , and then to the scribe who sat at His left hand entering the name of the fellow bringing in the trophy , so was I able to move away often and come back . Yet on all that long evening , for so long indeed as the line lasted , so did Usermare-Setpenere stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His feet . Ip356realized once again how to be near Him was to gain all knowledge of how a God might act when He is in the form of a man . He looks so much like a man and yet reveals divinity by even the smallest of His moves . In this case , it was that He did not move His feet . To receive a thousand men , and another thousand , then another , to take into one 's right hand the severed hand of a man dead since this afternoon , or dead in the last hour we were still killing our prisoners  --  to inquire the name of the soldier who has given over to you this cold hand , or this warm hand , then tell it to the scribe , then throw the hand on the pile without ever moving one 's feet , was an exhibition of such poise that one saw the mark of a God . He never moved His feet . Each time He cast another hand onto the pile , and may I say the pile grew until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the same grace by which He steered Maat and Thebes when the reins were about His waist , that is , He did the task perfectly . One could not think of another way to have done it . He was showing us the nature of respect . The right hand of a dead warrior , the same right hand that might have seized His own in a treaty , having been given to Him , so did He cast it onto the pile with care , and to the place where by His eye it belonged . The pile grew like a pyramid whose corners are rounded , and never did He allow the base to become too broad nor the top too blunted . Yet He was also careful to avoid the vanity of building too fine a peak , for then one misplaced throw could destroy the shape . No , these hands were added to the pile in a harmony between the height and the base that was equal to the harmony with which our Ramses received His soldiers . " Here Menenhetet closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect as in his description . When he began to speak again , he said , " You may be certain that the calm of this ceremony was not matched by the scenes on our campground so recently a battlefield , and now a campground again . It is one matter to kill a man in battle , another to find time at that instant to cut off his hand . Oh , there were sights even in the worst of it when your chariot was overturned , yet through the spokes you 'd still see one of ours on his knees sawing away at the wrist of some Hittite he 'd just dropped . You 'd even see some fellows so blind and red-faced for their trophies that they did not see the Hittite who came up behind , killed them , and started to cut off their lips , the lips ! Can you imagine if we had lost the battle to the Asiatics this day ? " You can see then that no good soldier would stop to claim ap357hand during the tides in and out of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that evening when men who had been the bravest on the field were without a prize at night . Those hands were worth much to a soldier . You were able to say your name to the Pharaoh , and have it put on a list . Benefits , even a promotion , could follow . Besides , it was humiliation to go through battle and not have a hand to show . What , after all , were you doing ? I can promise that fights broke out . When one squadron of chariots who had fought with the King 's Household discovered that a company of infantrymen from Amon , the first to run , were now approaching the Pharaoh 's line with a larger collection of hands than the charioteersthemselves , a second war nearly began among our own . Soon the officers were in a council to make peace on this matter . " They knew there would be terrible argument unless they agreed on some allotment . A fracas could spew forth in front of the Pharaoh . So , forcibly , we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That way we could determine the numbers of hands to be passed out , platoon by platoon . If it came to five for every eight soldiers in one company , you may be certain the five strongest men then seized their hands regardless of how they had fought that afternoon . Let me tell you  --  more than one ear got bitten off in the little fights that continued . Given the outrage of real warriors who had been passed over , not to speak of the bravadoof many a big fellow who had been a coward earlier but was not remembering it that way now , we embarked on a night I will not soon forget . Another fifty of our own must have perished before the darkness was done . " It was worse with the captured Hittites . Wherever one was not guarded by brave and responsible officers , he soon lost his right hand . More than a few bled to death . More than a few had the stump bound with a leather thong and went on to live and be brought back to Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave with one hand . All the while , those of our men who had not been allotted a trophy went searching the bloody ground with their torches , and some even dared to cut the hands off our own slain , although to be caught in such an act was equal to losing your arm . After all , everyone 's trophy would be tainted tomorrow if some of the hands proved to be Egyptian , so , count on it , every dead soldier of ours who was found mutilated at the wrists was stripped of his few clothes and his face soon made unrecognizable  --  I will spare you more . Even so , the corpse still looked likep358one of ours in the morning . With or without a face , a dead and naked Egyptian does not look like a naked Asiatic . We have less hair on our bodies . " Speak of hair , these poor Hittites had beards like thickets and probably hoped to protect their necks from a sword . They also had hair on their head as tough as the hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skulls from our clubs . Small use now . Even a helmet can not protect you from all blows . As the night went on , we used these captives , we gorged on them , we devoured them , of that I will speak . Everywhere was the comic if piteous sight of ten or twenty Hittites all tied with their hands behind their necks , the same cord binding them to the throat of the next fellow , until when told to walk , twenty would hobble along in a lockstep , their eyeballssqueezed out of the heads by terror , their necks at an angle , yes , so hunched up and bound together you could mistake them for a clump of figs on a string , except that these figs groaned frequently from the pain of their bonds . May I say their captors guarded them poorly . Any gang of soldiers who came blundering along could cut off the first or last on the line  --  it was too much work to untie a captive in the middle . Then you would see some sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asiatic 's beard was treated like the groin of a woman , and his buttocks as well ; why , you would see five men working on one fellow who had already been turned into a woman , and one poor captive was even put into harness like a horse while our soldiers played with him as they would never dare play with a horse . This Hittite could not even get his mouth open to scream  --  it was filled near to choking . Picture the fury of the man who straddled his head . " You would have thought with all the blood we had seen this day that some would want no more . But blood is like gold and feeds the appetite . You could not smell it enough and some could not even taste it to their full content . All of us , despite the discomfortof being covered by it , sticky with it , crusted over , came , sooner or later , to want more . It was like fresh cosmetic over old . Blood was now as fascinating as fire and nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fire , but the blood was here in everybody 's breath . We were like the birds who collected in a million and infinityon this battlefield and would feed through the night on all they could tear from the flesh of the slain . They would fling themselves into the air with a heavy tilting of the earth as we came near and give a clap of sound like thunder , but it was only the uproar ofp359their wings breaking away from us and the blood . Then there were the flies . They enraged us with their bites as if they now carried the fury of those we had killed . In the pestilence of those insects , I brooded much on the nature of wounds , and thought of how a man 's power goes out of his flesh when he is injured , and travels into the arm of the man who gave the wound . On the other hand , so soon as you laid a cut into a man , you could treat his pain . If you were sorry for what you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might reduce the suffering of your victim . The Nubians had told me so . But if you wished to irritate his wound , you did well to drink hot and burning juices , or wine heated over a fire . Then would his wound be inflamed . So I was thinking of the Hittiteswho had given me the cuts and slashes I knew on my chest , my arms , and my legs , and I looked about until I could find a Hittitesword . All through the night , I oiled this blade and took care to bury it in cool leaves so that it would ease the festering of my body tomorrow . I also drank hot wine to irritate the wounds I had left on Illy enemies . " I remember some of us even took the heads of Hittites and put them on long pointed sticks . While others held torches , we waved them aloft . We stood on one side of the river , across from the walls and gates of Kadesh , and we mocked them in the night while the banks began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a monstrosity in hot days to come . " As we stood at the river , arrows came our way from the walls , not many , so few as to make me wonder at the thousands of Hittite soldiers who had not fought today  --  why were they silent with their arrows ?  --  it hardly mattered now . We were so drunk that when one of us , a charioteer next to me , was struck with a spent arrow in his chest , the point going just deep enough to stick in his flesh , and thereby oblige him to remove it , he threw the head and shaft away , rubbed the wound with his hand , and with a laugh , licked the blood from his fingers . When his chest still bled , he painted his skin with it . When still it bled , he cut some locks from the beard of the dead Hittite on his pole and stuffed that into the hole in his chest . " " There is , " said my mother in a sudden intrusion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men . " As she spoke , I was close to her feelings , twice close because of pretending to be asleep , and I lived in her emotions once more . Never had I felt such rage at my great-grandfather , yet I could also feel her courage top360scold him sink into itself as she looked at his face , for she was also much excited . Her belly had an ache of expectation that settled in my head like the pain of a tooth . It was enough to make me cry out . Menenhetet merely shook his head . " On the other side of the river , " he said , " at the top of a tower , was a woman who looked out at us and saw the Hittite whose beard had been shorn of a lock . She began to scream . Maybe it was the face of her lover that she recognized , or her husband , or a father or a son , but I tell you her shrieks tore the sky . Her moans were bottomless . I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who make such sounds at any funeral . Hypocrisy is the possession of such women . For their grief speaks of the terrible end of all things in their heart , yet a year later that same woman will be with a new man . " My mother answered in a deep voice . " Women search , " she said , " for the bottom of their grief . If they can find it , they are ready for another man . Why , if I were ever to weep for a lover and learn that my sorrow was bottomless , I would know he was the man I must follow into the Land of the Dead . But I can not be certain of such feelings until I wail . " She gave my great-grandfather a triumphantlook , as if to say : Have you ever believed you could be that man ? Ptah-nem-hotep gave a small smile . " Your account , dear Menenhetet , has been so exceptional that I have had ten questions on every turn of the battle , yet I did not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hathfertiti , out of the depth of her feelings , has spoken to you , let me ask : What are the sentiments of My ancestor , Usermare-Setpenere , during all of this , this dreadful night ? Does He really see none of it ? Do His feet , in truth , not move ? " " They never moved . I had been , as I said , standing near Him , and I would also , as I said , go away . When I came back the pile would be higher , but nothing else had changed , unless it was the mood of the Pharaoh . That grew more profound . No matter how well one came to know Him , even if you were to see UsermareSetpenereevery day , be certain you would not approach with ease . If you found Him jovial , then even from some paces away , you would feel the same as you did on entering a room full of sunlight . When He was angry , you were aware of that before coming through the door . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our shield . The Hittites could not see into the dazzling light that camep361from His sword . The horses of our enemy were afraid to charge . One does not ride up to the sun ! " As this night went on , however , I saw He was not only the Beloved-of-Amon , Blessed-by-the-Sun , but also a King to live with the Lord Osiris in darkness and be familiar with the Land of the Dead . It is certain that the longer He conducted this ceremony of asking each soldier his name , repeating it to the scribe , and making a throw of the hand onto the pile , so did the weight of His presence grow heavier on me until I would have known with my eyes closed that I was somewhere in the presence of Ramses , just as a blind man can tell that he has stepped into a cave , even a large cave . On this night , my King filled the darkness , and the air near Him , unlike the fires of the campground , the red lick of the flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air cool with the chill of the cave . He was observing the spirits of the dead , or at least that much of them as could be known by their hands . Even as we appreciate something of a stranger by taking his fingers in greeting , so could my Ramses know a little about each of the enemy soldiers as He held their last manifest for an instant . So He understood a bit of the character of the fellow and his death . Never had I seen my Monarch brood in such a way , and His mood continued to deepen until it was much like the sound that holds your ears in the roar of the Very Green . " Indeed , as I stood near Him , which is to say as I entered the cave He inhabited this night , I could not know if each thought I comprehended was mine or my Pharaoh 's . I only knew that the longer I looked at this pile of hands turning to silver in the moonlight , the more I thought of how the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned the field . They could not put the curse of their dead on us so long as our Pharaoh touched each evil thought in the hand of each lost soldier , and drew strength from it for future battles . So did my Pharaoh hold the fortunes of our TwoLandstogether . " I stayed so near to Him for so long that whenever I left to go wandering around the campground , I think I shared a part of His thoughts . Or maybe it was no more than the keenness of His nose for what was next . I know I was hardly surprised to come over a hillock and there between two rocks find Hera-Ra half-asleep under the full moon . I do not know if the lion had never been put back in his cage or whether some of our soldiers had set him loose , but he was quiet and only half-awake . Still , such were the fires of thisp362night on this field just a hill away from the solemnities of our Pharaoh , that Hera-Ra now gave a great broad grin at the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs , showed me the depth of his anus and the embrace of his front paws and invited me to roll on his belly . I never knew the day I would have been that brave . Not in four lives . I patted his mane , kissed him on the cheek . With a grunt and a growl , he rolled over again , got up , and burped in my face to give a sour whiff of all the blood he had drunk ; but then , my breath with its wine could have pleased him no better . At any rate , we were now friends enough to go for a walk . I do not know if I ever felt any more life , health and strength than making the tour of that flame-filled bloody field with ten thousand of our madmen spread over all of these meadows and a thousand fires you could look into for a carouse , yet I was the only one with a lion ! It was a wealth of sights  --  more buttocks than faces ! " Let me say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of camp followers had marched along with the Division of Set , for these were the soldiers last to arrive and they came in on the full moon . They were famous as a lot of fornicators and buggerers , this Division of Set . The tortures that had been tried up to now on the captured Hittites were nothing compared to the practices of the fresh troops who had just joined us . " They had done little that day but march , and toward the end , as they got word of our victory out of the mouth of some messengersfrom the Division of Ptah , they had broken into their provisionsand were drunk when they arrived . Now lines of men were waiting before each whore brought in by these soldiers from Set ( who incidentally were collecting Hittite spoil in recompense ) . I saw more ways of making love that night than I would see again in three full lives . Since there were more men than women , it behooved you , if you had concern for your own buttocks , to see who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those Nubians are big , and it is the practice of their males to use one another until they are rich enough to afford a wife . On this night , woe to the poor Egyptian soldier if he waited in front of a Nubian , for he was soon on his knees , Egyptianor not . We are a smaller people . That night , a good deal of our strength was given over to the Nubians and the Libyans , and for what good return ? To be able to shoot the few arrows you had left into the loose cave of a mongrel whore ? The rush was so great in the fires of this night that many a man could not wait for his place at the front , and so took the girl between her cheeks , while she wasp363busy up forward , and thereby made a three-backed beast , a copulationof serpents . Now , a new man was at her mouth , and another in the third man 's bottom . They looked worse than those captives who had been tied like figs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . ' Over it all was the smell of sweat . I could smell the buttocks of half an army . A fit husband was that odor to blood and smoke . I would speak of these acts as abominations but it was less than what was yet to come . Besides , I will offer no judgment . After all , is not our word for a night-camp the same as one of our expressionsfor fornication ? I can only say I was part of it , and much stimulated . I swear , if it were not the Night of the Pig , you would not know so much of this . Enough that Hera-Ra and I moved through campfires and snoring drunks , through lovers and plunderersand scavengers , even past the groans of our wounded  --  for in the middle of it all , men were still dying , our men mostly ( theirs already gone )  --  our amputees and our belly-gutted fevered , dying first of thirst , then of wine given them to drink . Sometimes you could not tell the oaths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries did Hera-Ra and I walk among the flames . Occasionallythe lion would trample over a group of copulators , squeezing their grapes , so to speak , and many a soldier , catching the breath of the lion in his nose , or the wild look in his eye ( and Hera-Ra , even when feeling like a kitten , had the wildest pale-green eye anyone had ever seen ) would , staring face to face with such a beast , lose his erection for this night and more . Such frights , like a sword , cut you off . The whores , be it said , loved Hera-Ra . I have never seen women so insatiable , so brutal , so superior in pure joy  --  it is their art , not a man 's . Even in this riot , where one came forth so much more than one wanted that the joys were like the throes of one 's death , it was still extraordinary with these women . They were only camp whores with putrid breath , but I saw the gates of the Heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetest shoots right into the center of themselves . It must have been all the blood and burning flesh . Maybe Maat approaches with love when all are choking with smoke . You have to wonder how many Generals are conceived on campgrounds such as this . " But I spoke of burning flesh . You can not know the hunger that comes to your stomach on a battlefield . It mocks the hunger of your private parts . I was ravenous , and Hera-Ra was ravenous . All of our army was hungry , and after we ate all we had plundered from the f iittites , we broke into our own provision trains . I sawp364salted quarters of beef thrown into the fire , then pulled out , and sawed up for steaks , one side black , the other red . Then the cow was thrown back again . Soon they were cutting into the dead horses as well . " It was , however , a peculiar hunger . I do not know for how many I can speak , but each taste of meat gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy myself on beef , nor even on horse , although there was something already in the flavor of the cooked blood in a stallion 's meat that spoke of strange truths and new strengths . I just kept eating to fill a hole in my intestines . Maybe it was the presence of the lion . He kept poking his snout into the wounds of the dead , and before it was over , many of these men had become as ravenous in their taste  --  how can I confess it to you ? Walking next to that lion , he became my best friend on the field . So I could see into his thoughts as clearly as into my Pharaoh 's , and the lion , to my surprise , had a mind . Now he did not think with words , but with smells and tastes , and every sensation put sights into his eyes . As he ate the raw liver of a dead man  --  I think he was dead , though he twitched  --  Hera-Ra was seeing our Pharaoh . I knew , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Pharaoh had made him happy , just as happy as the liver of the brave warrior he was eating . Then it turned out that the dead fellow was not so brave after all . A taste of bile came into Hera-Ra 's throat . Like a dirty vein through the liver was the secret cowardice of this warrior . " I watched Hera-Ra nibble on dead men 's ears until he found those that pleased him most . It was then I could see that as he ate , he had before him a heaven with stars more brilliant than our own smoke-filled sky so obscured by mist and scud . Indeed , my own mind felt blessed as he ate , for I was learning that our ears are the seat of all intelligence and the very door to the Blessed Fields . Now Hera-Ra began to lick the skin of many a forehead . With deliberationand much choice in his taste , he passed from head to head comparing the taste of their salts . Soon enough , I knew why he enjoyed such licking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him most was of a soldier running uphill , forcing his face up the hill into a stiff wind ; truth , the fellow he finally chose had been a monument of perseverance . Then Hera-Ra ate him by the testicles as well and chewed into the groin . The soft growls of Hera-Ra were enough for me . I realized he had selected this fellow as the very seat of manly strength.  | " I must tell you more . Before the night was over , I , too , indulgedthe meat of a limb , burned it in the fire , took a taste , and knew that the pleasures of a cannibal were going to be mine this night . Suffice it that the first step in what is considered the filth of my habits was taken . It has led me through many a wonder and many a wisdom . But then you do not really wish to hear more of the Battle of Kadesh . Let me say only that human fat , gorged in considerable quantity , has an intoxicating effect . I became as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut his mouth and did not speak again.  |p366WE  were left with much curiosity . The silence broke , but only J1 ' into another silence , and our Pharaoh gave a wise look at the fireflies and said , " I hope you will continue . I would like to know of the next day . " Menenhetet sighed . It was the first sound of fatigue he had uttered on many a breath , and the insects quivered behind their fine linen . Did I see what was not to be perceived , or did the glow of these mites fade in salute to the dawn that came outside the walls of Kadesh when the fires were burning down and exhausted soldiers began to sleep ? It is certain that their light was less . But then I could remember Eyaseyab telling me that the finest food for these fireflies was themselves , and they ate each other . " I do not know how much there is yet to tell , " said my greatgrandfather . " Metella must truly have been cursed by his secret whore ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight thousand infantrymen , nor with what were left of his chariots . Even when we took a captured officer , tied his arms to his chariot , and drove him into the river so that he drowned under their noses , Metella did not come out . I thought he was a fool as well as a coward . He should have attacked . We were so festered and unruly that morning , so entangled in a million and infinity of evil spirits that Metella could have overrun us  --  unless his troops had also had a night like ours . " We held a council . Some of our officers spoke of siege , and tried to tell how Thutmose the Great had cut the fruit trees in the groves surrounding these hills in order to build the siege-walls that He brought forward against the walls of Kadesh . In the months ahead , if we did the same , the city could be taken . My Ramses listened , and looked affronted , and said at last , I am not a slayer of trees . ' By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no easy departure . First , our dead had to be buried ,  |p367and  our wounded gotten ready for the trip . It took a lot of digging before the bodies were covered over , and the pits were never deep enough . These dead men were pressed down so tightly that a hip , an elbow , or even a head would push up and the birds must have had their pick . Of course , the insects devoured the other half . Seeing those myriads swarm over the pits before they were even covered , I knew the answer to one question forever . I learned why the beetle Khepera is the creature closest to Ra . In the middle of any hot night , beneath the silence , give a moment 's attention : You will hear the mightiest sound of them all . It is the drone of insects . What multitudes ! They possess the silence . " Needless to say , a few of our dead were saved from the birds and the maggots . Each division had a platoon of embalmers who carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Princes and Generals who had fallen . Even if you were no more than an officer ( but also happened to be the dead son of a rich merchant ) there was a good chance someone would speak up for your remains . No embalmer could be unaware of the award he would receive in Memphi or Thebes if he delivered a well-wrapped son back to the family . Before it was all over , a hundred officers were stacked with care on the different work carts , and though the task was done in the field , only a few of these wrapped bodies began to stink . " The wounded were worse . Some lived . Some died . They all stank . The Divisions of Amon , Ra , Ptah , and Set traveled behind each other in so long a line that it took a day to move from the van to the rear . Now we were truly like a worm cut in four pieces . Yet the smell connected us . We moved slowly , a thick river , full of rot , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the rocks of the gorges . " Of course , we were all in pain . Who did not have foul cuts and scrapes ? I soon grew a dozen boils to meet my other afflictions , and you could feel the poison of these wounds growing in new places even as they were being worked out of the old . Some of us were demented by fevers after the third day , and in the heat of our march , what had seemed a victory quivered before us like a defeat . By the fourth day , we were being attacked . A few of Metella 's best troops began to follow , not enough to matter , but in sufficient numbers to raid our rear . They would kill a few , wound a few , and ride away . We would lose time in chasing them , more time in burying our dead . Since the carts for the wounded were filled , foot soldiers werep368now used as litter-bearers and some dropped from the heat and were left behind and had to catch up again . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even tried to steal a few of the donkeystransporting the hands . We used more than ten for this purposealone and each carried two large bags , one for either side of their back . The smell was not atrocious unless you came close  --  there is finally so little flesh on a hand that the skin dries quickly and by itself  --  although the odor from one of those baskets ( if you were fool enough to put your head in ) was as clear to the nostrils as rotten teeth . A true curse . Leave it alone and it would hardly stir . Go too near , and the stench lived in the lining of your nose . HeraRacould not keep away . Untethered , he would bother these donkeysin the worst way . Trying to bolt , they tangled in their harness , nearly strangling  --  donkeys in doubt always climb over one another  --  and in the confusion , a bag broke . Hera-Ra made a meal of what fell to the ground . I came running up to pull him away since I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late . He had gorged on a dozen of those hands , and then more . Pictures of the Pyramids danced in his brain , then sights of great cities . I had never seen buildings like the ones Hera-Ra now envisionedin his head . They showed thousands of windows and great towers and went to vast heights . It was as if a part of great buildingsyet to come was in the knowledge of those hands he ate . Yet what a dreadful meal ! Hera-Ra had teeth strong enough to break your bones , although not quite  --  his mouth was happier in soft flesh which he liked to tear to strings . Now he broke one of his own teeth , and whimpered like a baby at the pain , yet kept on eating  --  all that unspeakable swallow of leathery skin , cursed smell , dried flesh , together with those little bones of the hand that crunched so hard . All the same , something in their odor drove Hera-Ra to more . He growled in real rage at me when I tried to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some curses we dare  --  we wish to penetrate them . A dull anger went up from these mutilated hands at this second destruction . But then , that was why Hera-Ra took on such a fury . It gave him visions of the future . Again , I saw buildings high as mountains . " The lion turned ill from his meal . By the next day , he could not walk . His belly swelled , and his hind legs , which had suffered any number of slashes from Hittite swords , began to fester . On his shoulder , an open hole from the point of a spear turned black . Ilep369could not keep the flies away . His tail was too weak to brush them off . We built a large litter and six men carried him , but Hera-Ra 's eyes took on the dull shine of a dying fish . I knew the hands in his belly were gripping his vitals , the little bones flaying his intestines like knives . " My Pharaoh was with us ten times a day . The Royal Wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and He walked along the litter beside Hera-Ra and held the beast 's paw , and wept . I cried as well , not just for love of Hera-Ra , but in the terrible fear of knowing that the animal would not have gotten ill if I had kept him away from the donkeys ' bags . " Once , His tears washing thin lines through the black and green cosmetic about His eyes , Usermare-Setpenere said to me , Ah , if I had vanquished that Prince of the Hittites who met Me alone , all would be well with Hera-Ra ! ' and I did not know whether to nod or deny His words . Who could decide whether it was better to encourageHis wrath against Himself or take it on my back  --  I should have known the answer . My good Pharaoh Ramses the Second was not made to bear His own anger . " Then the lion died . I wept , and more than I would have believed , and for a little while my sorrow was all for Hera-Ra . I even wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beast . " Few of the embalmed Princes had also been granted the honor of having their organs properly wrapped . The provision wagon of the embalmers could carry a few sets of Canopic jars , but how many can you treat when it is four jars to each fellow ? Even Generals were having their organs thrown to the woods . For Hera-Ra , however , the embalmers used the next to last set of jars , and his wrappingwas supervised by Usermare-Setpenere Himself . Indeed , I heard the rage in His voice when He examined the intestines and found bits of broken bone protruding from the coils like arrowheads of white stone . By the look my Pharaoh cast at me , it was clear that I was out of favor again . " My punishment , however , was not so simple this time . He had me travel with Him often in the Royal Wagon . We sat on chairs of gold and looked through open windows at the chasms of the gorge , while we rocked perilously within . Certain bumps so tipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand ) that we all hut went over . " Sometimes , He would not say a word . Just wept silently . The eye-paint streaked . The Overseer of the Cosmetic Box would repairp370Him , a nimble fellow , nimble as Nef "  --  this with a nod to my father  --  " and we would sit in silence . Sometimes when we were alone ( for on occasion the King would wipe all cosmetics from His face and dismiss the Overseer ) He would speak briefly and in gloom about the campaign . I did not win , I did not lose , and so I have lost , ' He said to me once . Since His eyes did not leave my own , I nodded . It was the truth . But not even the Gods love the truth when it scores each breath . Before the day was out , He said to me in the gloom of the carriage , You should have given your arm to HeraRabefore you let him eat those hands . ' I bowed . I struck the floor seven times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bumping like a rock in a fall . It hardly mattered . A sigh , long as the sound of the death that had come out of the lion , now came from the throat of Ramses our Second , a terrible sound as though the eyes of the lion were losing their light once more . What can I tell you ? I thought often of the meaning of that sigh , and realized that the death of the lion was the end of Usermare 's happiness at the sight of me . In the heart of His rebuke was the thought that if I did not know how much my good fortune depended on the health of His beast , then good fortune and I were best separated . " We were . By the time the troops returned to Gaza , I was transferred from the Household Guards of Usermare-Setpenere to the charioteers of the Division of Amon , and I may say that no division of the four was in worse repute after Kadesh . Still , we were given a good reception by the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last days of our return , people cheered us on the road . A runner traveled in front to tell them that the Armies of Ramses the Second had scourged the Hittites from the field . " I think my Pharaoh must have listened to His messenger . He had healed from His wounds and looked magnificent . On the last day I would see Him for what would yet be fifteen years , He was on the parade ground at Gaza . There He displayed the winged bull of the Hittites and gave it to the city as a gift . This captured God , He told the multitudes , would protect our eastern frontier . By the next day , we began our march to the Delta , and , once there , sailed up the river to Thebes . I sat in the same crowded galley with my back pressing against the knees of the man sitting behind me , and since the winds were not steady , our trip upriver was even longer than the descent . Soon after our arrival , I was sent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , my King was banishing me to a distant place called Eshuranib . In command of a sm4l detachment ,  |p371I  went up the Nile as far as a boat could go , and then had twentyfourdays of march across a desert whose heat I will not soon forget . " Even as . he spoke these words , I could see such a desert before me . " In that time , " he said , " I gave my farewell to every great and exalted moment I had known . The desert was hotter than the steam that rises from the Land of the Dead , and I was an officer without a true command . " He ceased , he nodded , and said , " I think I can end my recollections here . "  |p372THERE  was a sigh . Ji . ' " It is true , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " that I asked you to tell us of the battle and you have done this well . Yet I can not say that My desire is to hear no more . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menenhetet , but his voice remained dry . " Good and Great God , " he said , " a life of monotony and foul work were now my reward . Do You truly wish an account of my years in the desert ? " My mother , who had been listening to my great-grandfather with more patience than she usually possessed , said , " I agree that we may not wish to hear this . " She laughed at the boldness of her remark , and looked into the Pharaoh 's eyes , indeed , lay her long black eyes on Him much as she might have ensconced her breasts upon His chest . " I wonder , " she murmured , " that I do not flee in panic for daring to decide what might be of interest to You . " He gave a tender smile , but spoke to Menenhetet . " How long , " He asked , " were you at Eshuranib ? " " For fourteen years . They were long years . " " And the gold mines were already there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I would hear what you will say . For how could you live in any place and not see what others fail to observe ? Besides , gold is never without interest . " Menenhetet gave a curious bow , and by the light of the fireflies I was aware suddenly of all that shone of gold , of the flat collar around my father 's chest and the snake of gold on my mother 's head , the gold bracelets of Menenhetet , or , for that matter , the gold in the houses of all nobles we would visit . It was then I thought I heard , like a faint cry , some echo of the labor that had delivered this wondrous metal , and I saw the Pharaoh nod wisFly as thoughp373He had also heard such groans and they were part of the curious value of gold . Much like moistening the memory of old dust , did my greatgrandfathermove his tongue . " Your desires , " he said reluctantly , " are the source of my wisdom . " " Spoken like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swallow of his beer . " I will say , " he told us , " that there was never a time in my four lives when my throat suffered so . If there was an affliction worse than others in the mountainous deserts of Nubia , it was the dust on one 's tongue . I remember that my sufferings began on that twenty-four-day march through the desert . My detachment was sent off without any better company than our platoon of prisoners , my few fellow-soldiers , and two guides who seemed to live on a handful of grain a day , drank little water , and took pains to defecate once a week . They prayed at dawn and at dusk . That was their nearest approach to a vice . What soldiers they would have made . I needed those guides , for in the heat of the march , which was greater by far than any that I had known in Egypt or at war , the desert was full of dangers , and I saw many Gods and demons in the air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that when I died I would not have to take the long trek to the Land of the Dead inasmuch as I had already crossed the desert . I believe I even saw Him . ( Althoughwho could know what was seen in these valleys when great mountains of rock quivered before your view as if ravished like wood in a fire ? ) " We arrived in Eshuranib at last . I saw a cliff with stone huts at its foot , but the quarry had neither a stream nor an oasis . Before us were no more than two great bowls of soft stone , cisterns to hold our water . We were free to drink every drop of rain that fell from the eyes of Nut when She wept for Geb , but even this water , so vital to our throats , had to be used first for the ore . So our thirst continuedand lived with us like an illness through all our work . We used to dig our shafts into the quartz of the cliffs before us , setting a fire at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire enough  --  and then the children of our miners would crawl forward into the fissures to pick out the ore that had cracked loose from the rock and was now brought forth to be ground on a wheel of granite . When the rocks were too large and would not crumble , they would be raised by means of a leather rope as thick as my arm , then shatteredon a great flat stone . The leather rope , I remember , was alwaysp374breaking . So the curses and the beatings never stopped . Nor did the sound of running water ever end . It flowed from our cisterns to inclined beds of stone where the ore was washed . Afterward , when the sediment had settled , we would drink a little , then carry what was left back to the cistern . When I think of Eshuranib I can still taste that water . " Since my great-grandfather now paused again , Ptah-nem-hotep said , " Yes , I am most interested . " " We had , " said Menenhetet , " hundreds of workers , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent to this place for crimes they could no longer remember . They were soon stupefied by the heat , and blinded in the sharp dust of the mine shafts . Yet children were born in this place , and I saw a few who had grown to manhood here although they only spoke in some mixture of language I can not describe , but that is because the soldiers who guarded these criminals were wild Syrians with great beards , Ethiopians with painted scars , and pale-colored blacks from Punt with curved Egyptian noses . Their languages mixed togetheruntil I knew the meaning of no sound , yet I was the commanding officer of this paltry legion . " " Why , " asked our Pharaoh , " did Eshuranib have need of a charioteer ? " " In the reign of King Amenhotep the Second when they began to dig , it is said that three were assigned . I know what purpose those charioteers served in their day no more than I know why I was needed there . Soon , the other two charioteers and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quartz from the mines out to the stone tables where the ore was washed . Then I grew so bored I even tried to improve our methods for crushing the larger pieces of quartz . The leather rope , as I said , was always breaking , so I worked at tying knots until I found one that would hold better and not snap the rope like a knife . Some hard years began , and for the longest time I learned nothing but the secret of boredom which tells you that no Gods , good or ill , are near . " But , even as I was brooding , the rock would drop on the stone , and our river of gold would be dug out of the earth , pebble by pebble . It was a fever . " Menenhetet sighed . " All the same , " he told us , " the search kept some kind of fire alive in the heart , even if it was never our own gold . Still , it was cruel . There may be no torture like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned much . " " And you learned nothing ? " Ptah-nem-hotep asked  |p375My  great-grandfather was silent . Now I saw how fine was the mind of our Pharaoh . He said , " Can this be true ? I feel as if you are keeping knowledge to your-self . " " What I could tell You , " my great-grandfather said in reply , " is not large . " " Yet I would suppose there is as much to learn from this small matter as in all you have told us tonight . " My great-grandfather 's voice showed admiration . I do not know that I had heard such a tone come from him before . " You hear what I have kept beneath my thoughts , " he said into the eyes of our Pharaoh . " Yes , You have searched it forth . I was not about to tell , but Your knowledge of me is as powerful as a command . I may as well confess that there was indeed a small matter from which I learned much . For I found a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret that is more valuable than any other I have acquired : " Here , he paused as if he had already said too much , and yet , reluctant to say more , must therefore say it quickly . " This prisonerwas nothing but a poor Hebrew sent here for a crime his friends had committed . All the same , he interested me from the moment I saw him inasmuch as he looked like the Hittite who fought alone with Usermare at the Battle of Kadesh . Like that warrior , he had two different eyes . It was as if one looked on yesterday , and the other would see tomorrow . His name was Nefesh-Besher , which are the words of his people for Spirit of Flesh . I called him , therefore , by the good Egyptian name : Ukhu-As . After all , he had been born in our Eastern Desert near Tumilat , and therefore the truth of his name could come just as well with our Spirit of Flesh as with the Hebrews ' . I may say he came to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were the Hittite . People who look alike are alike . They are formed by the same agreement among the Gods . " Now , Menenhetet nodded again . " Yes , I owe much to that man . " He was very sick when I met him , yet his wife  --  who was the nearest to what you might call a good-looking woman in this place  --  still thought enough of her mate to share his captivity and march across the desert by his side . How she nursed him . Ordinarily , a fellow like this would have been buried in a few weeks . However , I was curious enough to keep him alive , and , as a result of the good share of food I sent their way , Ukhu-As became confiding . He was going to perish , he said , yet he would live . So he said . At first I thought he must he in fever , but he was so quiet , and so sure ofp376what he said , that I began to listen . He had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to know in the city called Pithom , which the Hebrews had been building for Usermare ever since He became Pharaoh . Moses had been sent out to the Eastern Desert to serve as leader of these people . For that matter , I thought I remembered a tall Hebrew by the same name  --  Moses  --  in Thebes . If that was the man , he used to ride among the hundreds of nobles who followed Usermare on visits to the Temple of Karnak . Since he was Hebrew , this Moses had to wait outside , but some thought he might be a son of one of the little queens in the House of the Secluded from the time when Seti the First was Pharaoh . We never knew . I did not see him often . Now Ukhu-As told me that in the same season when Usermare marched to Kadesh , Moses arrived in Pithom dressed as an Egyptian officer and told the Hebrews he would take them to a land in the East they could conquer . Ukhu-As said he got that tribe to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being caught . Yet this feat was simple . During the night , Moses had taken a few of the strongest young Hebrews on a raid and they killed the Egyptian guards of Pithom in their sleep . So , no pursuit was possible . " Ukhu-As told me that he , however , did not flee with the others . His wife was away that night visiting her parents in the next oasis , and he loved her so much that he did not want to leave her . Since he surrendered himself to the authorities , he was not sentenced to death , only to Eshuranib . " When I asked him if he hated Moses , he shook his head . Not at all . Moses had passed on a great secret . It was how , on your last breath , you could put yourself into the belly of your wife . " Here he was . This Nefesh-Besher , this Ukhu-As  --  dying  --  yet he spoke of living . And not at all in the way some speak of continuing one 's name through the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the child you make in your last moments of life can become a new body for yourself . To hear this said with confidenceout of the mouth of a sick man was unforgettable . While he could not give me the Hebrew words for the last prayer to be said within your woman 's body , there , at the last moment , still , I had been his benefactor , so he would pass it on to me through his flesh . And he instructed me to do something most disagreeable , but I did it on the night after he died . It is not easy to tell . I have explained how Hera-Ra taught me the ferocious virtues to be obtained from eating the flesh of others , but that was in the thicli , of the nightp377which followed the day at Kadesh . When you grabbed a bite from a roasted limb , you did not ask from where it came  --  blood mixed as easily with blood as meat with meat . Here , however , the fellow had been sickly , now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than one day after he expired . In that way , he could serve as my guide without a prayer . " " How disgusting and unforgettable is this thought , " said Hathfertiti , but her voice was without strength . Menenhetet merely looked solemn . " I could not , " he said , " have done what he asked except there was nothing to greet me at Eshuranib but the old boredom . Still , I approached this little meal with such revulsion that it took many attempts to swallow one morsel . Yet I held it down . I felt no new knowledge within me , yet I did  --  I could not say . " A few weeks after Ukhu-As died , his wife told me she was pregnant . Nefesh-Besher had been well named . His spirit was certainlyin her flesh . It was just that he did not survive as well in her loyalty . She had taken such good care of him that she had used up her affection . When I saw the look in her eye , I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she became my mistress . " I was weary of the smell that rose from the cheeks of men weaker than myself . So I kept this woman . Her name was RenpuRept , and that was a good name . When she gave herself up to the joys of making love , she was to me  --  in these harsh ovens of Eshuranib  --  like a young plant and a Goddess of the Nile . How I enjoyed speaking to the little Ukhu-As who was now within her . Soon I came to realize that one 's member can say much to an unbornchild . Do you know , I felt the ambition and the great rage of the new Ukhu-As , still unborn . Of course I had no fear of him , and I laughed . His former wife was such a pleasure . Why , Renpu-Rept taught me as much of his wisdom as he had known himself . He used to make love without letting his seed come forth , she told me , and I was quick to acquire his practice . To believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward , was the only belief to keep you alive at Eshuranib . So I became acquainted with living at length in the cave of a woman , and many were the litanies she taught me to say to myself until I was the master of my own river and could send it curling back to my groin . That offered me one more mad to the Land of the Dead . There were times , lying with her through those hours , when I felt as if I floated on the brink of my own extinction so long and so well did I hold my breath , and my heart within it , indeed , so high did 1 rise on the very roar of thep378sounds within myself that I could have been above a cataract that would wash me out of myself forever into her . So I knew the way . I could run those waters . So I speak of it , but I was not curious to try . For steeped in the sentiments that rose from her flesh , I was happier to meditate through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt as fortunate as a Pharaoh in the House of the Secluded and had splendid thoughts , and lived in the reverberation of all things . " Sometimes , during our long embrace , Hera-Ra would come to visit , and whether it was his true ghost I can not say , but he was near and I was like an animal myself , and thereby close to the sound of all languages . In the arms of Renpu-Rept , the cries of the wild creatures outside , and the babble that rose at night from the huts of the village , began to speak to me of the mystery of many languages , and I came to see how certain sounds may say the same thing in all tongues . I would ponder over each word for mother among the different people of Eshuranib , for they all had the sound of m ' within , and would ask myself why a barbarian had only to speak in rage to remind you of the roar that is heard in the letterHomage to Hera-Ra ! Deep in the going-forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask myself if was the sound of all knocking , even as pa ' might be there for the sound of men , like the sound I made in her cave with my club  --  pa ! pa ! " Through the long days at Eshuranib , I had made efforts to learn how to read , and it had been simple so long as there was a sacred mark for each of our sounds , but now I began to ponder some of the more curious tones for which there were no hieroglyphs . Eh ' is without one , and oh ' came out of my throat like the long note of the wind , and needed no mark . Nor was there a writingyou could make for the scream you hear when someone feels a pain that can not be endured  --  ' eee ' is that sound of pain , even as oh ' is the reverberation of the belly , and again there is no sign for that . I had heard such cries all my life , but I began to listen to them more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards were always beating the prisoners . And now , at night , there were also other sounds , softer cries , oo and ah  --  those moans that come from the lowest part of the stomach where one feels the pleasurecommon to all . At evening , you might expect such murmurs in every street and house of Memphi , but it was different to hear it rising in the dark out of the shacks of the workers of Eshuranib ,  |p379their  pleasures coming to my ear like the trip across water from one island to another . After all , we live in a sea of sound . " Afloat on such thoughts , deep inside her , close to that heaven where Nut meets Geb , there , through those hours of bathing in her waters , while the rage of the unborn child moved against me , I brooded on these matters of language and longed for a sight of our Nile , and the baby grew larger in her belly . " Then , there came a day when I knew great excitement , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power he claimed . " I saw him on the day he was reborn . Two separate eyes looked out at me from the face of the infant just delivered , and those eyes hated me . For yesterday and tomorrow ! What pleasure I had enjoyedwith Renpu-Rept ! Yet this tiny creature was too powerless to offer a curse , and could only wave his fists . Never had I felt such excitement looking at an infant just born . You know , I would have been ready to raise that child . What could prove more interesting at Eshuranib ? " It never happened . The dust of the mines came into the baby 's eyes and **26;11326;TOOLONG was blind at the age of three months , and soon died . That taught me more about these arts of being born out of yourself . It is not enough , I learned , to conceive your next life in the last minute of this one  --  that may be a bold art , but you need enough sense to pick the right woman for your mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddess of the Nile . I stayed in that hut at Eshuranib with Renpu-Rept for many a year , and was not too desperate , for in time she became nearly so beautiful in these practices as the secret whore of Kadesh , and in all of my first life I can say that I never knew such peace as with her  --  but at a mean price , for each day , out in the sun , the stone was raised , the stone was dropped , the quartz was crushed , and the waters ran over the sloping tables to wash out the dirt from the gold . More gold ! The beatings went on , the cries resounded in the night . There were times in my despair when I came near to gamblingmost dangerously with the gifts given by Nefesh-Besher and I thought to die and be born again . But what folly to be born in that place ! Yet one time I all but expired before I brought myself back , and a child was conceived . When , nine months later , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , I mourned her loss like my own limb , but I also knew I could not live forever in Eshuranib.  | " Then it became a question of whether I would take RenpuReptwith me . I came face to face with the cold features of my own heart . How much would I value this woman if I were back in Thebes ? She was not a wife for a Master of the Horse , or , better , a General  --  which I was determined to become  --  more than ever after the loss of these years . Then  --  I do not know if it was misery at the death of our daughter , or horror at the cold she sensed in my heart  --  but my only true wife , Renpu-Rept , also died of a terrible fever . I could not believe how I mourned her . No one , ' she said to me at the last , will ever be so near to you again . ' " How long I might have survived alone I can not say , but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival , and this sum resounded in my mind for the rest of my first life . It was equal to the pieces of Osiris ' body . Therefore , in the hour of my release , I wondered who my true God could be  --  Amon or Osiris  --  and the question never left my first life . But more intoxicatingthan my wonder at these fourteen years was the sight before me of a detachment of new soldiers . A charioteer was with them . My replacement . He handed over a papyrus to tell of my orders to return . " " So the King had forgiven you ? " Menenhetet nodded . " I would expect of My ancestor , Ramses the Great , " said our Pharaoh , " that He would never forget , and He would never for-give . " " He never forgot , but there came a year when He needed my help . " " Can you tell Me truly that this was the year ? " " No , " my great-grandfather confessed , " it was not . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By way of her mind , I entered his mind , and my **26;11354;TOOLONG were full of shame . He could speak of eating from the ham of a dead man , but he could not bear to confess cheap practice . He sat becalmed in his seat . " You bought your way out of Eshuranib , " said my mother . " You are no better than Fekh-futi. "  |  --  THERE was an exclamation from my father at this mention - Li. of his father , but a glint came into Menenhetet 's eye like the light I had once seen on a merchant 's face in the sharpest moment of the bargaining . " Yes , " he said , " I bought my way out of Eshuranib . But I cannotboast that it was clever , merely that I was able after fourteen years to put aside enough gold to make arrangements for a large payment to a General in Thebes . In return , my name was put on the list of charioteers assigned to the Royal Household . " Ptah-nem-hotep asked , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been promoted by comparable pay-ments ? " Menenhetet did not look away . " What matters is that they ride well . There is no cure for injustice other than committing another injustice to correct the first  --  let the river wash away the bad blood . " My father nodded profoundly as if this last remark were the thighbone of all wisdom . " Not the least , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " of your qualities as a Vizier will be your ability to take our petty vices and return them to us as virtue . " " That is the way it may now seem , " agreed my great-grandfather , " but I can tell You , Divine Two-House , it was not easy then . I had to wait a year after I made the payment . All the while , since I did not tell Renpu-Rept , I began to wonder if I could desert her , and after she died , I thought of those Hittite hands we collected at Kadesh and was terrified that my own would soon be added to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last meal , I decided the most terrible punishment must be to lose your hands , for it would prove the same as loneliness . With/out our hands , we can not know the thoughts of others . We are left only to our own thoughts . Do not ask me why this is so , but I know it . To reassure myself , I looked again and again at the papyrus I had been sent from Thebes . It told of my zeal to guard the gold of the Pharaoh from all who would steal it . ' Well , I did my best to believe this . " " I must leave you to the Lord Osiris , " laughed Ptah-nem-hotep . Menenhetet touched his head lightly to the floor . " Good and Great God , " he said , " I brooded much on the nature of proper behavior in those days . Since this papyrus bought with stolen gold testified to my honesty , I came to realize that a man who lies can be as comfortable as anyone who tells the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch him . Such a man has a life as true as an honest life . Consider it . An honest man is miserable once he begins to lie . For then he must remember the truth , and what he said that was not the truth . So is the liar miserable so soon as he speaks in an honest voice . " I say this because Ramses the Second  --  as I soon learned on my return to Thebes  --  had become a liar . Forgive me , but it is the Night of the Pig . I discovered I was known to all , and for the worst of reasons . My name was on every new temple wall , and I can promise that in the years I was gone , many temples had been built . Usermare was always erecting some monument to Himself , large or small . You could not fail to see His statue at any bend of the river , and commemorative pillars in every grove . Be certain that in each new temple was an account of the Battle of Kadesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forever crying out , O my Lord , we are lost , we must flee ! ' and I would shake my head on seeing it as if that could erase the sacred marks . Go , Menni , ' He would answer , I will fight alone . ' Even my name was wrong . I , who had learned to recognize MN on a papyrus now found it cut into the stone as MNN . I was still ignorant . I did not see how there could be any error on a temple wall . I did not know then , as I would learn in my second life , that scribes know less than priests but are all too ready to inscribe a stone . I did not realize I was looking at a crude error . I stepped backward , as if the temple wall could fall on me . I thought of all the prayers I had offered to great and little Gods , ten hundred such Gods , but I had addressed Them with the wrong sacredmarks in my heart . MN beseeches You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said MNN . " Now , if the misspelling of my name bothered me so greatly ,  |p383think  of my confusion about what was written in stone . That could not be false . I must have said things in the battle that I had no memory of saying . Yet in the same temple , on another wall , as if the truth was no better than the wall at which you looked , I would read , word by word : Lo , His Majesty hastened to His horses and stormed forward  --  He alone . ' I would awake in fever that night with the wall pressing on my chest . Had the Pharaoh been alone in His Chariot through all of the Battle of Kadesh ? It took me years to comprehend that , to Himself , He was by Himself . He was a God . I had been no more than the wood of His Chariot . " All the while , as if to mock me , I became renowned . My name was cut in stone . My deeds might count no larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacred worm . In the barracks , among the charioteers , a subtle derision greeted me . One or another would always cry out on my arrival , Here is our hero of Kadesh . ' " What do you mean by that ? ' I would ask . I did not like the word he used for hero . It could also mean bird ' or coward . ' " I mean that you are a hero . We know that . ' There would be much laughter . I could do nothing about it . These charioteers from the best families of Memphi and Thebes were not about to fight . It was well known there was no officer I could not defeat . So they mocked me in their noble manner , which was to play with words until the meaning was as hard to catch as a minnow with one 's hands . I took a vow they would serve under me before I was done . " Then an event took place which did , indeed , teach me new ways . Word came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been in Eshuranib , many small wars had been fought with the Hittites , but so soon as Metella was gone , his brother , Khetasar , proposed peace , and was accepted . It may be that our Ramses was tired of war . Each year for fifteen years , He had found Himself in the field . So , at Tanis , in a splendid temple just completed , He received the new King of the Hittites . Khetasar brought with him a silver tablet on which were more than a hundred lines of writing clearly engraved into the metals , and I still recall what it said , for all of us in the Household Guard who were at Tanis looked at it closely : This is the treaty which the great chief of the Hittites , Khetasar , the valiant , son of Merasar , the valiant , and grandson of Seplel , the valiant , has made on a silver tablet for Usermarc-Setpenere , great ruler of Egypt , son of Seti I , the valiant ; grandson of Ramses I , the valiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these nations forever . '  | " I read all of it , taking in the words one by one , and was much impressed that it had been composed by the Hittite King , for our Pharaoh would not have spoken in such a way . I may say that this tablet of silver had the light that comes from the moon , and that gave me a new fear of these Hittites . With their dirty beards and clumsy chariots , they had seemed crude , yet how wise was this tablet . The phrases were in such fine balance that you could feel peace was near : Between the great Prince of the Hittites , and Ramses the Second , the great Monarch of Egypt , let there be a beautiful peace and a beautiful alliance , and let the children 's children of the great Prince of the Hittites remain in a beautiful peace and a beautiful alliance with the children 's children of Ramses the Second , great Monarch of Egypt . Let no hostilities arise between them . ' " Why , this Khetasar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egypt to the Hittites , then shall the great Prince of the Hittites take him into custody and cause him to be brought back to Ramses the Second , the great Monarch of Egypt . But when he is brought back , let not his crime be brought against him , nor shall his house be burned , nor his wives and children killed , nor his mother slain , and he shall not be beaten in his eyes , or in his mouth , or on his feet . ' And it would be the same for any Hittites , " said Menenhetet , " who fled from their country to ours . I was much impressed with the good sense of this . It takes no great effort to make people go back to the land from which they have fled , if they are not afraid of terrible punishment . I was even more impressed when our Ramses allowed the name of the Prince of the Hittites to come before His own . That had to be due to His respect for all these fine words written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of the most powerful strange Gods . It was said , A thousand of the male and female Gods of the country of the Hittites , together with a thousand of the male and female Gods of the country of Egypt , will be with us as witnesses to these words : The God of Zeyetheklirer , the Gods of Kerzot , the God of Kherpenteres , the Goddess of the city of Kerephen , the Goddess of Khewek , the Goddess of Zen , the God of Zen , the God of Serep , the God of Khenbet , the Queen of the Heavens , and the Gods and all the Lords of Swearing , the Goddess and the Mistress of the Soil , the Mistress of the Mountains and the rivers of the land of the Hittites , of the heavens , the soil , the great sea , the wind and the storms . ' " That was how it ended , " said Menenhetet , " the wind and the storms , ' and there was a hush when all was read and we werep385finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver of the tablet , and the mark was made . He embraced the messengers . Lo , the war was done . " When Menenhetet was silent , our Pharaoh yawned . He did not seem pleased to hear the names of so many strange Gods , and remarked , " Hathfertiti may be wise in her wish that you return to more amusing matters . Yes , " He said , " You hide yourself too much in this account . You are too modest . " He shook His flail as if to clear the air of all echoes of this treaty . " Do you know , " He said , " that when I first ascended the throne , your name was always on the lips of My little queens ? " " My name ? " asked my great-grandfather . " None other . " " But I have not been in the House of the Secluded since the year I served there for Usermare . " " For that , you were mentioned all the more . I grew to detest their fascination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the little queens think of you . " On this pause I lived in the mind of my mother , and knew her discomfort . It was as simple as the beating of my own heart : Our Pharaoh spoke so easily of hearing the thoughts of others . Now , He must be enjoying her thoughts far better than she could hope to dwell in His ! On that instant , like a cloth thrown on a spill of soup , the inside of her head became as clean as a floor that is wiped . Ptah-nem-hotep gave a smile . I wondered if He was amusing Himself with how empty and polished were the thoughts presented to Him ; then He laughed . " Yes , " He said , " no man in Egypt attractedmore attention than you , Menenhetet , among My beauties . They live in a sea of gossip , and you were the storm that hides in the wind of the sea . Even now , they suffer a perfect fury that not one of them was invited to be with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger in their direction . " So be it . They will talk of you tonight , and tell again all the stories I have already heard about your second life , and your third , and your fourth . Of course , your first life is their favorite . They will never quit speaking of how you were **25;11382;TOOLONG , and yet , so great , they say , was the prestige of the House of the Secluded in the years of Usermare , that you were made Governor of the Secluded . " " Is that how they speak of it ? " asked Menenhetet . " By half , " said Ptah-nem-hotep . " Some of the little queens keep a high opinion of their importance . Others wonder how a **29;11409;TOOLONG could bear to become a keeper of concubines . They have quarrels over this , I assure you . Still , I expect you fascinate them for a better reason . No story absorbed My harem beauties ( nor Myself ) so much as the one that is always whispered  --  for they believe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially since your account of your first meeting with Ramses the Second and His Queen is most innocent . But they say  --  you see , I whisper it Myself  --  they say you became the lover of Queen Nefertiri . I even heard that you departed from your first life and enteredyour second by way of a knife left in your back . That you died as your seed went forth into the Queen . " Ptah-nem-hotep smiled , a true sweetness on His lips . Had He been waiting through this night to encourage Menenhetet to tell us about the love of Queen Nefertiri ? He was certainly amused by the shock He had given to all . My mother had every thought at once , including every one of my father 's . His thoughts leaped into her . He saw Menenhetet lying on Nefertiri 's belly . Indeed , my father was so overcome by the sight of family flesh upon royal flesh that his groin was plucked , and he came forth right there and was wet beneath his linen . My mother was instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was the finest lotion she had ever found for her face . Menenhetet began to cough . A desert wind could have been whistling down the caverns of his body . Yet so soon as it was gone , he was quick to speak . " I do not wish , " he said , " to contradict Your amusement , but there is much I can not recollect . To be born more than once , as I have been born these four times , is not the same as remembering each life clearly . " " All the same , " our Pharaoh replied , " My request is that you tell us of your friendship with Queen Nefertiri . " " I served first as Governor to the little queens , " said Menenhetet . " Only later did I become Companion of the Right Hand to the King 's Consort , Queen Nefertiri . " " Then I would hear of these matters in order . As you tell us , so may you remember much that you believe is forgotten . " Menenhetet bowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will , " he said , " say again that these matters are more difficult to relate than the story of one great battle . " " Yes , " said our Pharaoh , " but I feel no haste . It is My prefer/ence to be entertained on this night through all the hours of dark-ness . " " And to be amused by Your guests , " said my mother . " Yes , by My guests , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , and as if her attention  --  if it became too sulky  --  would spoil His own , He gave her a dazzling smile , then turned back to Menenhetet . " Find your memory , old friend , " He said . " May I speak , " asked Menenhetet , " of the years after Eshuranibwhen I rose in the army ? I think that may warm my thoughts . For I confess , it is not comfortable for me to move so quickly into the Gardens of the Secluded . " " I say again , " said our Pharaoh , " tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go back to my careful study of the treaty with the Hittites written on silver . For I would never have become **25;11440;TOOLONG if not for the influence of those words on me . I had never read language so fine . It suggested to me that I must learn the arts of subtle men . This Khetasar had known how to address Usermare . All I had gained until then had come from the gifts of my body , but , now , if I would thrive in the world , I must learn the arts of speech . " " Did you discover many principles for such use ? " asked my Pharaoh . " One principle above all : Avoid all subjects of which your superiorsare afraid . All men are afraid , I learned , and do everything in their power to conceal what they fear the most . Those , for example , who are cowardly will tell you of their acts of courage so long as you were not there to witness them . " I , who used to believe all that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I soon could recognize ambitious men by the traps they set to discover if you told the truth as little as themselves . I came to enjoy such games and the people you could play them with . Be certain I studied flattery . That was still the fastest way to become valuable to one 's superior . Of course , by the balance of Maat , I also had to learn that it was not wise to become too indispensable , or you would never be given a promotion . Look at the best of houseservants . They always die in the same job . The trick , therefore , is not only to please one 's superior but inspire a little uneasiness  --  the fear , at least , that you know his fear . That will make him wish to promote you . He can still receive your compliments but at a safer distance . I even had to learn how to keep my inferiors from ad/vancing more quickly than myself , which was a skill I had always scorned before . What need had I of flanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believed in nothing but attack . Yet I had learned , by way of Hera-Ra , that the unforeseen could destroy you . So I was careful to slow the ambition of officers beneath me , yet quietly , so they did not know , and to my superiors I tried never to be unsettling . I had come to understand that no one hates the unforeseen so much as men of powerful family and mediocre ability . Amuse them , titillate them , confirm them in their habits , speak softly to their fears , but do not alter their day . They are terrified of all that is larger than themselves . " " Never have I heard you speak more eloquently , " said our Ptahnem-hotep . " It is the voice of the highest servant . " He reached across the table and tapped Menenhetet with His flail . " But why , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " do you tell these truths ? Why not hold more closely to your principles and offer a few lies ? " Now , my great-grandfather showed a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well that You will never know when he is ready to betray You for the first time . " " You set My heart to beating , " said Ptah-nem-hotep . " Now , you must tell Me what is next . " I could see , however , that He was greatly amused for He had succeeded in making my **25;11467;TOOLONG once more. 388p3891K " I MAY , " said Menenhetet , " have spoken too much of these low arts . It would give the impression I was not a true soldier . That is misleading . While the Hittites never rose again , our armies were always in some small war , and I fought at Askelon , at Tabor in Galilee , in Arvad and the lower regions of Retenu , a hundred battles , although none like Kadesh . We were always strong , and never were we surprised again in our camps . " All the same , we fought for years . Each year we would gain much territory and take several towns . Then we would go back to Thebes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much in taxes and spoil . " My career , however , prospered . I was the only Egyptian officerwho could make war in the field , yet had studied the skill of flattery in Thebes . Our High Priest , Bak-ne-khon-su , was so old by now that on many a day , he sent one of his Second Priests for the daily audience with the King . So I learned the art of flattering SecondPriests . That is the most demanding practice . May I say it helped if you brought something to eat  --  at least to those priests who were fat . The thin ones proved more difficult . Sometimes , they could only be charmed by one 's knowledge of special prayers . But then the fat fellows were always happy to tell you which verses appealed to the thin priests . " He smiled . " I must say there were some very thin servants of Amon who were satisfied only if you gave them gifts of the rarest papyri , or stones of fine color brought back from the wars . Misers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each priest , fat or thin , who could speak to Ramses the Second , and I watered them like my own tree . Of course , my Pharaoh did not like me a great deal better than on the day He had sent me away to the Nubian desert , but how could He name a Libyan or a Syrian to command I is Armies when an Egyptian as suitable as myself wasp390near ? I also knew how to speak of the infinite love of Amon for my Pharaoh 's face . He did not really want me for General-of-all-theArmies , but when the choice came down at last to Amen-khep-shuef , or myself , I think He found that He did not trust His son . How can any terror be greater than the fear of being betrayed by one 's own blood ? I was at last promoted , and given my gold carriage . " I think I would have been His General for many years , if not for a trait in Usermare-Setpenere that caused great imbalance in the stability of those days . While our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteemed and more beloved , yet His desirefor women was insatiable . How he thrived among the rivalries , jealousies , intrigues , and detestations He stimulated among them in the near to thirty years since the Battle of Kadesh . Only a God could have lived so far beyond the balance of Maat . In this manner , He was also Ramses the Great . " He was , of course , much changed from the young King Who rode with Nefertiri . I would even say it was the great and horrible day at Kadesh that affected Him forever , and in all ways . Certainly , His love for Nefertiri did not remain the same . Until that campaign , my King might spend an afternoon with one of His little queens from the House of the Secluded , or knock the cup of a farmgirl , or two farmgirls , as He did with me on that ride into the valley of His tomb , but that was no more than a sport . Nefertiri was His sister , the love of His childhood , His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married She was twelve , and He thirteen , and they say Her beauty was so full of light you could not look at Her . Even in the first years I knew Him , I do not believe He had many thoughts which were not of battle , prayer , Nefertiri , or His other true taste  --  the buttocks of brave men . " After the Battle of Kadesh , however , He was like an oasis that finds new water beneath its palms and divides to a hundred trees where before there were three . Our good Pharaoh came back from Kadesh with more hunger for the sweet meat of women than any man I knew in all of my four lives . He must have gained the seed of the Hittites He killed , for His loins were like the rising of the Nile , and He could not look at a pretty woman without having her . But then , He could like ugly women as well . Once , after He spent a night with a little queen from the House of the Secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her ( she looked like a frog ) He told me , By the balance of Maat , I hoped to find beauty within forp391the bad view without , and it was true . This woman 's mouth has captured the secrets of honey . ' " After Kadesh , if you had a wife , your wife was His wife . To belong to the Court of Usermare-Setpenere was to have His child in your home , yes , often a baby as handsome as the Pharaoh . Of course , on many a hunting trip , He would still hop on a passing girl . Along every road of Egypt , it was known that Usermare could come forth twice in the interval other men took to show themselves once . He wished to know as many women in a day as there were intervals between His duties  --  it was as if the great plow of Egypt was here to till the field . These were the years when He began our horde of Ramessides , that tribe now so large that by my third life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UsermareSetpenere . His seed is in the seed of all of us . No man ever created so many after him , but that is why the beauty of our Egyptian noblesis known by every land . He was beautiful , I tell you . At night when the Royal Barge slipped down the Nile , the wave it left behind made a sound so fine against the shore that women would turn over on their bed at the washing of its passage , and that was true . I was sleeping once when His Majesty went by , and my woman shifted her belly and gave me her back . " " How splendid ! " said Ptah-nem-hotep . " May I say , Divine Two-House , He was beloved , but not wholly beloved . " " Who but Queen Nefertiri , yourself , and a scattering of jealous women would not love Him ? " asked my mother . " One 's harem is never to be ignored , " said Ptah-nem-hotep . Menenhetet bowed his head seven times , but so gently as to stir no glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Not at all , " replied our Pharaoh . " As you know , there was a plot to assassinate My Father by a few ladies in the House of the Secluded . " " That I remember clearly , " said Menenhetet . " The trial of these women was held in secret , but it became the talk of Memphi and Thebes . It was said of Your Father that He did not know His Notables , nor how to hold the roots of their loyalty . But I can tell you that Usermare did . In His Reign , the Gardens were filled with women from noble families . I do not think my Pharaoh ever thought of any man or woman for long , but He understood the pride of such families . He knew how much disruption He caused whenever He chosep392one of their daughters for the Secluded . So , He also knew that one must hold such a family close . Loyalty is never more dependable than when it rests in shame and must call such shame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Too often , He ignored the families . Many of the Secluded would appeal to their fathers or brothers after an injury to their pride . I think that is how the plots to kill Your Father began , the plot that failed , and the one that may have succeeded . For His death was curious . " " Yes , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " I have thought as much Myself . " " That was twenty-five years ago , " Menenhetet said , " but alreadywe have had Ramses the Fourth , the Fifth , the Sixth , Seventh and Eighth  --  merely think of it , great Ptah-nem-hotep , in the seven years You have reigned , You have held the throne longer than any of Your brothers and cousins . " " Yes I have also had that thought  --  " He smiled . " I remember that My half brother , Ramses the Fourth , was most fearful . He wanted no girls from good families among His Secluded  --  He would take on no enemies . He closed the harem in His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behold , the girls were stout and strong and common , and their fathers had no noble titles . Just merchants and traders . " It was not attractive . Nor did any of My relatives improve matters . So soon as I was on My throne I paid a visit , and I was startled . So many fat women wearing so much jewelry ! All with garlic on their breath ! Now , the House is sweet again , although not so sweet , I know , as that time one hundred and how many years ago that you were transferred from **25;11494;TOOLONG to Governor of the Secluded ? " My great-grandfather did not reply at once , and I pretended to be asleep . A sadness passed over me . I was looking at the fireflies . Through the night , they flew in a cage from which they would never escape . I thought of the swamps near the Palace . Some hundreds of slaves with quick hands must have stood in that low water this evening catching them one by one . My sadness spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . It was then I realized that my own sympathy had been much increased by the sorrow behind my great-grandfather 's smile , a considerablesorrow , composed of many matters , the first of which must have been his recognition that he would continue to offer the Pharaohmore . My Pharaoh , by His own fine art , was cruel , no matter how He smiled , and my great-grandfather , for all his calm , stillp393wished to be Vizier and so would please the Pharaoh 's questions . " Yes , it is one hundred and thirty years ago , " he replied , " that I became Governor in the House of the Secluded . " " And were you pleased at this great change in your career ? " " I was appalled . I remember I had just celebrated my fiftieth birthday . I do not know for what I had saved myself but my body was powerful to behold and more beautiful to me than a home . I was **25;11521;TOOLONG , yet felt as if my life had hardly begun . I still lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a splendid marriage  --  I need only choose the lady . All was before me . " Yet , like the cloud that crossed the sun , so did the shadow of Usermare 's life come between me and any easeful wealth . For my Pharaoh had a fear in His heart that was like the gloom that came to me from the myrrh trees of the Temple of Hat-shep-sut . Except , it was not the Hittites of whom I thought today , but His own wife , Nefertiri , and there was reason for such gloom . He had taken a Hittite Princess for His new Queen . Now , while it was true that even before Kadesh , He had married another Queen , she was not to be compared to Nefertiri . Although a daughter of the last High Priest of Amon before Bak-ne-khon-su , and of a sublime family , so that the marriage wed the Temple of Amon to the Son of Ra , still this second Queen , Esonefret , was ugly , and Usermare soon ceased to give Her any place beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her down the river at a small town named Sba-Khut Esonefret , the Concealed Doors of Esonefret , and it was a good name . He bothered to visit just long enough to make a child from time to time . Nefertiri sat as the only Queen in Thebes . It was said for many years that Usermare would dare the displeasure of the Temple of Amon in preference to the rage of His First Consort . " Yet , when Usermare dared at last to marry a third Queen , the choice was as bold as the manner in which He drove His Chariot . For the new wife was the daughter of Khetasar , and young and beautiful . Her mother , the Queen Pudekhipa , was an Aryan from Mede , and it was said by all who saw her daughter that the pale blonde hair of the Hittite Princess was more luminous than the moon . " Here , I must interrupt , " said Ptah-nem-hotep . " How long had you been **25;11548;TOOLONG when this third marriage took place ? " " For five years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reign of Usermare , twenty-eight years after Kadeshand thirteen after the treaty . I know these dates well , for I became **25;11575;TOOLONG eight years after the signing of the treaty . " " One matter , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " still confuses Me . You speak of the furies of Nefertiri . Yet , at the time of the treaty , thirteen years before , it was already arranged that this Hittite Princess would become His wife . " " Your knowledge of such matters is close indeed , " said my great-grandfather . " Not close enough . I do not understand why Nefertiri agreed to this third marriage , " said our Pharaoh . " The Hittite Princess was only seven years old then , and not all matters in a treaty are equally honored . In those years , moreover , Nefertiri could not count as yet on the power of Her oldest son . But by the time that Usermare married the Hittite , the Prince Amen-khep-shu-ef had become a great General , and could prove a hazard to the throne . Besides , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed there was not even wealth enough at Kadesh to pay back loans Khetasar had taken on signing the treaty . Khetasar sent Mernafrure as tribute , no more . Usermare did not even receive Her . She arrived after a difficult journey , and as a gesture of contempt , was put into His harem at Fayum . There He met Her . No one in Thebes ceased speaking of it . For so soon as Usermare encountered this lady , He was overcome by Her beauty  --  so I heard  --  and removed Her from His harem , married Her , brought Her to Thebes . Worse . Her name being Mernafrure , all called Her Nefrure , which , being too close to Nefertiri , our Pharaohchanged Her name to Rama-Nefru so that it be near His own . Those who knew Nefertiri said no insult could be worse . " Menenhetet brought his hands together , and lay his face into the cup they formed as if to drink from the past . " This then was our situation : a Queen on either side of Usermare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect , however , that the first would fall on me . Usermare had come to the decision to send Amen-khep-shu-ef far from the Palace . His First Queen and oldest son must be separated . Yet He did not dare to send Him off to new wars in Libya without promoting Him . Since my rank was higher than the Prince 's , Usermare decided to give it to Him . " " Without a word to you ? " " I should have taken the measure of His distress . He was ma k/ing great plans for His Third Festival of Festivals which was nearly a year away , but would be the greatest of such festivals in His Reign . So He lived in terror that He would die in this year for He knew great uneasiness at His own deeds . He was building a grand chamberfor the festival  --  The Hall of King Unas  --  but to His wrath , He discovered it would take two years to quarry the stone upriver and bring it in . So He made the decision to pull down our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple of Seti at Abydos . He would use His Father 's stones ! These , and the stones of Thutmose , were the only marble suitable . I can not tell You how many priests had to be present at these works of demolition each day the stones were removed , and their curses  --  by way of the priests ' prayers  --  dispelled . Sometimes , the old inscriptions were chipped away . More prayers ! Sometimes , the writings on these stones were turned to the wall , and so were hidden from sight . How many great names were thereby buried in the Festival Hall of King Unas . " To the fear He knew of Nefertiri , therefore , was added the terror of shifting these great blocks . I remember that on the day He brought me with Him out to the stone works , He took me later into the room where He slept in the Little Palace , a great honor , for no one but His First Queen and His Second were usually invited there . Yet before He came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of plots and intrigues . " Now , my Pharaoh had a heart that was not like others . If our hearts were made of rope , none would have knots so great as His . His anger , and His fear , His breath , and His pleasure , were all wrapped around one another so closely He never knew the reason for what He did , yet He did all things with great force . The strength of all that passed through His heart had force enough to bruise the air itself . I do not think He even felt a whisper of His true fear of Nefertiri or Amen-khep-shu-ef , yet He felt , nonetheless , a terrible fear . It was so great , He even spoke to me . There will come a day , ' He said , of fearful bad luck in all three parts of the day . In those hours , someone will try to kill Me . ' It was His belief that some of the women in His House of the Secluded might know the assassin . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharp point of a sword , but more like a poison in His thoughts . Over and over on this day , He talked of plots , and while I did not understand it then , I can speak now of His fear . It is because so many come before a Pharaoh that His memory can never be good . To remem/ber , one must be able to look backward . Yet the Pharaoh is pushed forward by those who think of Him at every moment . Their thoughts are always shining into the darkness ahead for they wish to give Him the power to see truly into what is still to come . Only a Pharaohcan be our guide . Yet Usermare lived in so much fear that He was like a man who looks at a field glistening in the sun and thinks it is a river . Indeed , it is a river , but of light , not water . So did Usermare have an ear for treacherous voices and a nose to sniff out any plot against His glory , but He obtained His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So did Usermare see so far ahead that He even glimpsed the plot that was going to arise more than a hundred years later against Your Father . To a God , one hundred years is like the interval between two breaths . So He saw the blow falling on Himself . " Therefore , He distrusted the House of the Secluded . After many a pause , He told me that He had decided to place me there . I was the only man in the Two-Lands who was wise enough to discoverwhether there was a true plot or none . Yes , ' He said , at Kadesh , who else but you could know the mind of Metella ? ' He took my arm . No task , ' He said , is more important than caring for Me . That is noble work for any General , ' and He began to tell of great Generals of the past who had become Pharaohs . Powerful was His breath ! " Yet , He was sending me into a place where there would be none but women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the warrior in Him  --  even if it was His own order  --  must despise me . " So , I had to wonder if my new title  --  Governor of the Gardensof the Secluded  --  was also His way of telling me that thirty years might have passed , but He had not forgotten how I bled like a woman on the day He separated my buttocks . I might be a Generalto others , but from His exalted view , I was a little queen . Grand Nanny of the harem . Could this be His humor ? I nearly choked on the rage in my throat . " So soon as I was away from Him , I began to pray . Let there be a plot against Him , ' I begged , and I will lead it myself ! ' "  | " IN the Gardens of the Secluded , I learned what I could not have been taught in other places , and was introduced to beguilementsas different from war as the rose from the axe . While I can not speak of how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was the loveliest part of the Palace . Behind its walls were many fine houses , and from each kitchen you could hear much gaiety for many of the little queens loved to eat and were merry when there was food before them . And of course they loved to drink . Each day , after all , was like the one before . The little queens arose long after sounds from the Palace beyond their walls had awakened everyone but themselves , and through the morning they would dress each other and hold long conversations over what they would borrow , and told odd tales of what they had lost to one another . For if the Pharaoh happened to visit a little queen while she was wearing a borrowed necklace , it became her own necklace . Since the King had seen it on her , there was no question of giving it back . Of course , His gifts were never loaned so lightly . Any adornment that came from Usermare was not to be touched by anyone else . Once , a little queen broke this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty . Her small toe was severed from her left foot . As quickly destroy the first column of a temple built by Ramses the Great as lend one of His gifts . Afterward , this little queen did not dance , in fact , she hardly moved , and she ate tidbits like the candied wings of birds to restore the ache left by the stump of her little toe , and became so fat that everyone called her Honey-Ball . I was told of her when first I entered the harem . " In those days  --  was I more weary of my old command than I knew ?  --  I would kneel to study the flowers at the edge of each royal pond . There was one bloom , an orchid I would suppose , but of an orange hue , and I spoke to it many times , which is to say Ip400would utter my thoughts aloud and the flower knew to reply , although I could not tell for certain what it said . With no breeze passing over us , it would still stir when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulantly as one of the little queens in a dance , indeed its petals trembled in my presence like a girl who can not conceal her love . Yet this would happen when none of the other flowers were moving at all in the still air . It was as if the stem of this orchid had roots as deep as the thoughts of my heart , and I could breathe with the same God we knew tonight when He brought together those two pieces of black-copper-from-heaven . What spirit was in the flower I do not know , but the filaments would curl beneathmy eyes , and its tiny anthers would grow larger under the power of my gaze until I could see the pollen gather . " Like those anthers were the eyes of the little queens when they chose to adore the sight of you . I do not suppose there was one who was not ready to look at me in such a way before the year was out . But then , any man who was not a eunuch would have found it unnatural to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many female bodies . Since they belonged to Usermare , one would no more breathe their perfume too closely than drink from His golden cup . Death to be caught in the act with any one of these hundred women . While I had looked at death two hundred times already , and often with a shout of happiness , I had been at war . Death , in the moment you know your glory , can seem like an embrace by the arms of the sun , but now I was weak with the knowledge that I wished to live , and so had no desire to be dispatched with the Pharaoh 's curse on my back . " I spoke to the little queens , therefore , as if they were flowers by the edge of the pond , and did my best to show a General who cultivated a face of stone . Each of the scars on my cheeks might have been shaped by a chisel . " Of course , such fear did not please me . Each morning I awoke in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these beautiful women . I saw that my peasant beginnings , no matter how they had been dignified by the achievements of a soldier , would be of no use for comprehending the airs and silly disputes of this harem where I was now the Overseer , especially when I did not know if their arts of cosmetic and story-telling , of music and dance and kingly seduction , were as common here as an ass and a plow to a peasant , or partook of magic itself . Nor could I decide if the passing quarrels I witnessed each day were as important to the Godsp401as any battle between two men . Indeed they seemed to be fought as fiercely in some God 's service ! I was such a stranger to the House of the Secluded that in the beginning I did not even know how the little queens were chosen nor how many were daughters of the noblestfamilies in each of the forty-two nomes . But then the woman who could have told me much about them , the ancient matron who was their supervisor , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you tell us of the harem , " said Hathfertiti . " Since I have never been in the House of the Secluded , I can not picture for myself how it looks . Indeed , " said my mother , with every sign of annoyance , " there are no faces in your thoughts , nor anything for us to look upon . " My great-grandfather shrugged . " Surely , you are not tired , " said Ptah-nem-hotep , " now that we are near to these stories of love so much more curious to relate than the encounters of war ? " " No , I would not say to **27;11602;TOOLONG that my thoughts are weary , but still I hesitate . It is not easy to describe . I think it was the most curious year of my life . Do you know , I had never had a home before ? I had one now  --  in the Gardens  --  and servants to keep it for me . I was free to leave whenever I wished . I could , if 1 desired , have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside , and yet I was like a creature in the grip of black-copper-from-heaven . I did not dare to move from the Gardens . It was as if all I was now trying to learn would disappear the moment I stepped out through the gates and struck the clatter of the streets of Thebes . Besides , I was not so free . There was the unspokencommand of Usermare-Setpenere . He would not wish His Governor to be away from the Secluded on any undeclared hour when He might arrive . " Moreover , I had all the years of my life until this hour tocontemplate . " My great-grandfather looked sad . " Ah , " he said witha sigh , " the tiny birds need stirring , " and he waved his hand at thenearest cage . The fireflies remained somnolent . Behind the fine andtransparent linen that confined them , I could hardly see them stir . My great-grandfather did not speak anymore , and we sat insilence . This night , I had listened to his voice so many times that Idid not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he spoke . Indeed , what he had to say became clearerthan his voice , which is to confess that I began to have many picturesof the gardens in the I louse of the Secluded and saw the womenp402as their likeness appeared in his thoughts . I could have stood upon a small bridge over one of the ponds in these gardens , and heard the little queens speak to one another . And I could see my greatgrandfather'sface as it must have been then ( which was certainly as stern and as marked with the cuts of swords as he had told us ) but now I needed to keep my eyes open no longer , for so powerful became his thoughts that I could not only hear the voices of the little queens but his voice as well , and it vibrated inside me like the heaviest string on a lute . As I lay there on my cushions , asleep for all , my body feeling as agreeable as sleep itself , my eyes closed but for the veil of my eyelashes , I could see as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the paintings of Gods on the walls of many a temple and tomb my mother had taken me to , because such people never appeared on the street , nobody , for instance , with a long bird beak like Thoth , nor Sebek , the God with jaws like a crocodile , so could I understand that there were hours like this when you could see more than one face on a single person 's head , and my great-grandfather becameone by one , as I looked at him , the people of whom he thought , and I began to witness his story as if these people were in the room , and would even have been ready to walk among them if I had not been enjoying more the composure of my limbs . These thoughts no longer seemed to belong to my childhood so much as to what must he the wisdom , I supposed , of a man of twenty , but such enrichmentwas due , I believe , to my great-grandfather 's reveries as they passed through others before drifting on to me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , and no part of it was of any certain size . Where before I could have been looking at a couch , now I saw a road , and the arch between two columns becamelike the great doors Menenhetet saw at the entrance to the House of the Secluded . I even saw the two stone lions on either side of the Gates of Morning and Evening , and knew ( my understanding of these Gardens of the Secluded as rich as Menenhetet 's in his first days there ) that these lions were a gift to the Pharaoh from a place called the City of the Lions down the river , and I was taken past these marble beasts and went into the Gardens . I could even see the splendid bodies of the four black eunuchs who stood guard at the gate , and they wore helmets of gold . Their teeth were as white as the linen of the Pharaoh . Then we were in the harem , and the trees were so many , and the grounds that full with flowers I could recognize anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more blooms here than grew in all of Egypt , such reds and oranges and lemons and golds and golden greens and flowers of many colors with violet and rose and cream and scarlet and petals so soft as they came into Menenhetet 's thoughts that the sweet lips of the little queens might have been whispering on my cheek , never had I seen such color before , nor these black-and-yellow bridges with silver balustrades and golden posts crossing the ponds which wandered through . A green moss covered the banks , as brilliant in the soft light as any emerald . It was the most beautiful place through which I ever wandered , and a perfume came from the flowers and the fruit trees until even the blue lotus had a sweetness of odor . Since it usually had none , I did not know why I could sniff it until I saw black eunuchs on their knees painting the blue lotus with scented oils , perfuming the carob trees , and the sycamores , even the roots of the date-palms whose fronds , above , deepened the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky for the branches and leaves of the low fruit trees and the lattice of the grape arbors , and this shade gave back the lavender light of evening as one sits within a cave . Everywhere , birds flew from tree to tree and glided above the royal palms . There were ducks of every color in the ponds , bronzehuedducks with wings of saffron and garnet , and a black swan with a bright red beak who was called Kadima , the same as the name of one tall black Princess , Kadima-from-Nubia , one of the little queens . Never had I seen so many birds . Flying above our deserts and our river , they must have glimpsed the green eye of these gardens from a heaven away , and they came in such a splendor and confusionand outright gabble of voices that I could not have heard Menenhetetif he had still been speaking , for all of them , the geese and the cranes , the flamingos and the pelicans , the sparrows , the doves , the swallows , the nightingales and the birds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) covered the lawns and the swamps and the branches . One breathed in the hum and flutter and drumbeat of birds ' wings until their power to speak tore out of my chest like a breath I could hold no longer , and flocks of them flew up in a cloud of wings while others settled to the ground . Overhead , above the palms , other birds were fighting , and the cry of these battles also came down to us . Kingfishers soared , falcons soared , ravens went through their turns , while below were all the flights of smaller birds , full of messages for one another , as if all that wouldp404yet happen in our harem and our city was being told by one bird to another . There were hours when the Gardens were as noisy as a marketplace . Then as if the flowers knew how to calm the air , a peace intent with the sound of many a small sweet bird would come to us , and one could feel the cool of the day , and the murmuring of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook whose stream was lifted from the Lake of the Gazelle . Beneath the songs and disputes of the birds came a steady pumping from one shaduf above another , lifting water from the pool to a stream bed that led down to anotherpool , a splendid sound as it reached my ear on this late night , as comforting to me , on all these borders of sleep , as the unhurried beating of my own heart , for no sound was more virtuous than water being lifted by the strength of slaves . The streams were beautiful . The waters flowed over glazed clay bricks and over precious stones set within the bricks . The streams reflected the colors of the stones . I saw waters red as ruby , and violet streams , and a golden waterfall where the stream tumbled over plates of gold . I saw brooks with a bed that was mother-ofpearl , and one grotto was rosy as the setting sun , although here the shade was deep . By this bank , beneath the scent of an orange tree , one could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish would pass . None was larger than my finger , and they would all turn at once if I inclined my wrist , these silver minnows looking like moonlightin the water . I could have sworn they cooled the garden with their silver light . By one pond were no trees , but a lawn , green as the moss , and watered through the day by the black eunuchs . Too hot at noon , it was cool by twilight , and the little queens would sit on small golden chairs their servants had brought , and watch the passage of Kadima . The swan chose to pass at twilight as if she too wished to watch how the sky would draw in the night , and the birds came to settle . Then the eunuchs slaving at their shaduf could cease to turn the pumps and the water-pails moved no more . The little queens would lift the leaves from bowls of fruit . The smell of a pear ready to be tasted would join the scent of the flowers , and the feathers of the swan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew we were in the hour when the little queens would begin to stir , some to go down to the lake to bathe , others to return to their houses , their servants and their children . Before long , the sound of lutes could be heard in every corner of the night and the laughter of theirp405games . Some little queens were commencing their nightly beer-house . Menenhetet would walk through the gardens , following the stream from one pool to another , and the water , now that no eunuchs were turning the pails of the shaduf , made no murmur , and all the surfacewas dark but for the one brook whose bed was lined with gold . There , in the moonlight , shallows were bright as burnished copper , and Menenhetet , passing by the stream , would look at the silver minnows , the music all about him in the darkness , and the merrimentof the beer-house . Standing by the gold bed of the stream that flowed from the Pool of Beloved Wisdom to the Pool of the Blue Lotus , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little queens . There was a disloyalty in their voices he could not name , an affection for each other that held no sound of awe for Usermare , as if there were happiness at His absence ! Disloyalty stirred then in Menenhetet , and his breath became hushed as the water . He was ill with desire for the little queens . It was vivid as shame to be alone among so many women with not even a boy about older than ten , but then by that age , the children born here were off to the priests for schooling . All he heard were the voices of women who had no husband nor friend nor any lover but the Good and Great God Usermare . Worse . About him were all the plump eunuchs with their black muscles enriched by the air of their easy life . Thereby they were appealing to all  --  the hundred women and Menenhetet  --  attractionspowerful to his senses . His loins ached , his throat was gorged , and his mouth was so hungry he would not look through their windows at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , like the horse that hears a murderous beast in the rustle of a leaf , he started at each breeze . At this hour , there were eunuchs everywhere in the gardens , fondling one another with their fingers and their mouths , giggling like children , and the flesh of Menenhetetwas inflamed . A desire for satisfaction came to him like the urge for carnage that follows battle . Yet he could never go near a eunuch . They gossiped like children . Every officer would hear of it . To be near a hundred queens and lie down with a eunuch . Menenhetetwalked the gardens as if we were the ghost of a sentry who can not give up old soldierly duty . In the morning , it was easier . The little queens sang as they brushed each other 's hair . They searched through one another 's chests for clothes to exchange . They played with their children , gave orders to their servants . Since they could not leave themselves , their cooks were sent to the market for food , and scolded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the height of the day , the little queens ate at each others ' houses and exchanged gifts of fruit and oil , then decorated each other with flowers , or sang new songs . They trained their pet greyhounds , their cats and their birds . They told each other stories of their families , and taught their children of the Gods of their family 's nome , and the names of the Gods of the planets , and of the five senses and the four winds , and the Gods of the hours of the day and of the night . And in the late afternoon , after the little queens had slept through the heat of the day , they would meditate on their books of magic or mix their perfume . They would offer prayers and some would visit other little queens . At twilight , they might go to the pavilion to wait for Usermare . On nights when the moon would be full , He was likely to arrive at just that hour when the light would rise upon His Chariot , and Menenhetet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced ahead of Usermare through the street , then fell to the side and kissed the stone lions as the doors flew open . Then He rode in , leaving behind the two platoons of the Royal Guard , the fan-bearer and the standard-bearer , the mace-bearers and the lancers , and they , in turn , bowed to an escort of Princes and dignitaries who wheeled in their chariots and returned to their homes through the streets of Thebes , standing beside the grooms of the chariots in the near-dark , their bodies jolting to the clatter . He was now inside . There were times when everyone knew He was coming ; other nights He surprised all but the wisest of the little queens . Yet once within , nobody could say His mood . He delighted in presenting Himself as stern when He was pleased , or might be charming to a little queen and then leave her to weep in her chamberthrough many a night . " Leave now , " He might tell her , " your breath is impure . " Sometimes , when early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she went by , and on that lawn He would often remain , talking first to one little queen and then another , well into the night . Sometimes , it was only after the rise of the moon that he would select a woman and go to her house for the rest of the night . Of course , He might select so many as seven women and there had been festival nights when He celebrated with twice seven , but on a night much like others , it was not common for Usermare to appear too late . So the little queens who waited eagerly for Him when He did not come , having been given signs by their Gods that the occasion was favorable , were obliged now toassume that other Godsp407had intervened , or had prayers been spoken in an unclear voice ? They would raise a hand for their servant to carry away their golden chair and , furious with the perfume they had chosen , which could also have betrayed them , would walk down to the lake and wash in the moonlight , bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queens who might dress every night with attention , yet never be spoken to once by the King . Then , as Menenhetetcame to understand , they were at last like defeated soldiers and did not try to charm the King again for many months but would stay in their homes and teach their children and wait until another season had come . If they failed on Flood , they might even wait through all of Sowing and Harvest until the fields were bare again . Some never tried a second time . There were little queens who had lived for ten years in the Gardens of the Secluded and never saw His Splendor  --  it was enough if they could serve as friend to a little queen who was , for a while , a Favorite . Of course , Favorites changed . In the dry season , after Menenhetet had been Governor of the House of the Secluded for many months , Usermare arrived one night so late at the gardens that the disappointed women were already bathing in the lake . He was drunk . Never before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three nights on kolobi , " said Usermare , " and it is the strongest brandy in all of Egypt . " Here I opened my eyes long enough to see Ptah-nem-hotep nod as if the drink came into His mind with all its fiery virtue at the moment it came into mine . " Yes , drink kolobi with Me , " said Usermare as He came through the Gates , and Menenhetet bowed and said , " No honor is greater , " and gulped it out of the golden goblet passed to him . Usermare asked , " Is the kolobi hard to swallow ? " When Menenhetetdid not reply , He said , " Does what I say have an evil smell ? Drink ! " On this night , Usermare went down to the lake . It was a place He had never visited for so long as Menenhetet had been there , and thereby He surprised the few little queens who were bathing in the moonlight . Indeed they were frolicking before the eunuchs who waited on the shore , holding their robes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splashing sound of bathers trying to hide themselves . Usermare laughed until one could smell His brandy in the air . " Come out of the water and amuse Me , " He said . " You 've played long enough . " So they emerged , some more beautiful under the moon thanp408they could ever be in the light of the sun . Some were shivering . A few of the most timid little queens had not been near to Usermare for the longest time . One woman , Heqat , named after the Goddess of Frogs , had been , on occasion , His companion , and another , the fat one , Honey-Ball , had even been a Favorite until her toe was cut off . Now , she bowed before Him but with a flash of her eyes so intense that even in the night , the white of her eyes was whiter than linen . Although Honey-Ball was very fat , she carried herself as if she were the greatest little queen of them all , and did not look fat at this moment but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . Then they were all out of the water , and their eunuchs put forward golden chairs so that they might sit about Him in a semicircle , but Usermare asked , " Who will drink the kolobi with Me ? " and of them all , only Honey-Ball reached forward her hand . He gave it to her and she drank and handed back the cup and Menenhetetpoured more kolobi for the Pharaoh . " Tell Me stories , " said Usermare . " I have been drinking this brandy of Egypt for three days , and I would have done better to swallow the blood of a dead man . I have awakened each morning with a blow in My head from the ghost , but I do not know which ghost , although I could swear he is a Hittite , is that not so , Meni ? Hittites carry axes , " and He cleared His throat , and said , " Once in the mountains of Lebanon , I came to a valley that crossed another valley and in the center was a hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told you a story . Now tell Me one . " The smell of His brandy lay on the night air , full of the wounds of the grape . Usermare had lungs to breathe the flames of fire itself , but the little queens sat with throats full of unseen smoke . Heavy was their fear of the invisible fire of the brandy . A little queen named Mersegert , small in size and loud in voice , was the first to answer . Named after the Goddess of Silence , she was the noisiest in every group . Where others might be silent , she would , when in panic , rush to speak , and now she tried to tell a tale of a poor King who wandered with his horse in the dark becausethe stars were covered . " 0 **89;11631;TOOLONG , listen to my tale , " said Mersegert in her funny voice that came from the nose like a reed pipe . " This King was unhappy and poor . " " Of which country was he Monarch ? " asked Usermare . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mersegert.  | " Get on with the story , but tell it loudly . Your voice is best when you do not lose it . " " In the darkness , this King could not see , " she said . " He knew no direction . Yet the sky was visible beneath the hooves of his horse . It could not be seen above , but below , the stars were shining . The King dismounted from his horse , and lo , he was standing on the sky . The stars were beneath his feet . So he knelt and picked up one star , and saw it was a precious stone and had a God in its light . That told him to look for many more stones , and by their light , he was able to return to his kingdom , and was rich again . " Usermare broke the air with a loud hiccup . Everyone laughed at Mersegert . " I want a better story . It 's dark down here . We could use a few precious stones . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? I see Harmony and White Linen and Hippo  --  " He gave a nod to Honey-Ball and a few of the little queens giggled at the name He had just given her  --  " and Nubty and Amentit , and Heqat and Creamy . And Rabbit . Rabbit , do you have a story ? " Rabbit was the tallest of the little queens and among the youngest , and shy . She merely shook her head . " Oasis , what have you to tell Me ? " He asked . That was Bastet , named after Bast , the Goddess of all cats , but her eyes were beautiful and looked like two wells , so everyone called her Oasis . She sighed . She had a beautiful voice , and used it well , and spoke of the nine full moons before a child could be born , and the nine gates through which it must pass in the belly of its mother . Usermare-Setpenere was , however , so bored that He interrupted Oasis to say , " I do not want to hear any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A silence came forth . " Heqat , " He said , " it is your turn to amuse Me . " He burped again . The queens giggled . The sound might lap at the edge of His fire and soothe it . Tonight , however , He had had so much of the kolobi that they laughed in great doubt , not knowing if their mirth was soothing His temper , or inflaming it . " Great and Noble Two-House , " said Heqat , " I would wish to tell a story that does not displease You . " " Tell no stories of frogs , then . You are too much like a frog yourself . " Usermare always spoke to Heqat in just this manner . It was apparent I le could not bear her appearance . She was the ugliest ofp410the little queens , and for that matter would be the ugliest in many a group of women . The skin of her face was splotched , her neck was thick , and she was imperfectly formed . Her skin exuded a moisture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell him the truth , but several of the eunuchs offered up their tales , and if they could be believed , for they giggled even more than the women , it was true that once a year , on the height of the flood , the frogs would pass through the Gardens and swarm over the floor of every house . Then , on one of those nights , once a year , Usermare would go to her apartment and spend hours with Heqat in the darkness . Afterwards her place reeked from the labors of love . The eunuchs knew , for they would clean it , and on such a night two years ago , there had been a hailstorm , and half-formed frogs were found on her patio dead and dying and looked like men and women wrongly formed , a host of them come forth from the slime . On hearing this story , Menenhetet had thrust his arm through the air as though to wield a sword against the words of the eunuchs , for he wished to sever the image of Usermare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , by the bank of the lake , Heqat said , " In Syria , to the east of Tyre , the brides of many men are bought at auction . The most beautiful bring a good price to their family , but for ugly women in whom there is no interest , the father of the bride must pay the groom . So there comes an hour in the auction , when the passage of money changes its course , even as the tides of the Very Green wash out and then wash back . Much money is paid by the father of the ugliest bride . " The story had succeeded in capturing Him . There were murmursfrom the little queens . " It happened , " said Heqat , " that one woman was so ugly her new husband grew ill when he looked at her . Yet soon after her marriage , she was befriended in a dream by the Goddess Astarte . Good and Great God , our Astarte is the most beautiful of all Goddesses in the temples of my land , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptians . Now , Astarte said , I am bored by beauty . I find it common . So I take notice of you , poor ugly girl , and offer these words-of-magic . They will protect your husband and sons from every disease but the one chosen to kill them . ' Then Astarte disappeared . The husband of this ugly woman , however , grew so rich in vigor that he made love to his ugly wife every night and they had many children who were also healthy . When at last the husband died of the one disease chosen to kill him ,
