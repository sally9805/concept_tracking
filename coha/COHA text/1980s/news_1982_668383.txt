Between sheiks flashing their scimitars , Scots tootling their bagpipes and the 1982 Ken-L-Ration Dog Hero posed in a convertible , a newcomer might have forgotten he was celebrating an Italian seafarer ' s discovery of America . But to many of the 60,000 spectators who lined three miles of East Boston streets for the city ' s 35th annual Columbus Day Parade yesterday , there was no mistaking the occasion . " We ' re all Italian here , and Columbus was Italian , so we care , " said Laura Leo , of Bennington street , whose son Fonzie was disappointed because his Boy Scout troop wasn ' t asked to take part . " I watched Jack Kennedy march in this parade when he was running for senator , and we haven ' t missed one since , " said Barbara O ' Connor , 66 , of Brandywyne drive , whose nephews huddled in gray blankets along a curb . Boston Police , who estimated the crowd at 60,000 , said the 45- degree weather kept many parade-goers away this year . Even Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 25 parades , said she declined yesterday for fear of " courting pneumonia . " But the pomp of 15 glittering high school bands , the ceremony of 100 uniformed veterans ' groups , and the sight of a number of local and state politicians drew warm cheers from thousands of observers along the route . " Thanks for a warm hand on a cold day , " repeated a red-cheeked Frank McNamara , 34 , who is challenging US Rep. Thomas P. ( Tip ) O ' Neill , as he greeted spectators . Spaced among the marchers were more familiar politicians , including US Sen. Paul Tsongas , Gov . Edward King , gubernatorial candidates Michael Dukakis and John Sears , congressional hopeful Ray Shamie and several members of the Boston City Council . " Just about all the candidates were there , and they enjoyed every inch of the walk , " said Ernest Struzziero , the parade ' s grand marshal . The event was sponsored by the East Boston Veterans ' Council at a cost of $12,000 . Equally popular parade participants were tenor Luciano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bo , a retriever from Colorado honored by the Quaker Oats company for rescuing his owner in a raft accident . For sheer numbers and imagination , no one could outdo the 1500 Aleppo Temple Shriners from Wilmington , some of whom marched as Arab sheiks and Scotch bagpipers , sat astride prancing Palomino horses , or rode in clown wagons and miniature antique cars . But for many spectators who lined Bennington street and watched the parade wind toward Central square , the day brought back memories of other Oct. 12 celebrations and served as a reminder of their own pasts . " I was a piccolo player in a Columbus Day parade in San Leandro , Calif. , in 1974 . This brought all that adrenalin rushing back , " said Mary Dunlavey , 26 , of Lawrence . " We used to bring our babies to this parade . Now they ' re grown and we ' re alone , but my wife and I still come , " added Joseph Dello Russo , a retired electronics supervisor from Revere . Mark Grassio , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture has " become so assimilated , it ' s important to remember and be proud of our roots . " And Tony Marino , busy selling replicas of the Italian flag , said he was " delighted " to be celebrating Columbus ' 490-year-old discovery . " Otherwise , " he said , " there wouldn ' t be so many impulse buyers , or so many pretty girls out today . "
