Journalists always want their stories to be the best  --  and the first . This week 's issue features what we think are two notable examples of excellence and exclusivity . Correspondents Richard Behar and Scott Brown take a penetrating second look at the Exxon Valdez disaster . And in a special five-page section , Washington correspondent David Aikman talks with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the first major interview the Soviet writer has given to any U.S. news organization since 1979 . <P> After all the coverage of last March 's Alaska oil spill , was there anything left to report ? Nation editor Jack E. White figured there was . In the Los Angeles bureau , Brown pored over National Transportation Safety Board reports and testimony by tanker crew members and others to unravel the complex chain of events . Then he went back to Valdez to talk with Coast Guard investigators . Says Brown : " I found the web of culpability surrounding the accident was almost as sticky and far-reaching as the spill itself . " Meanwhile , New York correspondent Behar , who wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the captain 's  --  and his own  --  hometown of Huntington , Long Island . <P> Aikman jumped at the chance to interview Solzhenitsyn when the Soviet author sent word through his U.S. publisher , Farrar , Strauss &; Giroux , that he would be willing to talk to TIME . Says Aikman : " For any student of Russian thought and literature in the 20th century , Solzhenitsyn towers above the landscape . He has done more to influence Western views of the Soviet Union than possibly anyone else since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 . " <P> To see the reclusive author , Aikman drove to Solzhenitsyn 's home in Cavendish , Vt . " Solzhenitsyn 's somewhat forbidding reputation as a stern social critic , " says Aikman , " had not prepared me for the gracious host who bounded out of the house to greet me . " The author 's wife Natalya and their son Stepan , 15 , listened in as Aikman conducted the 2 1/2-hour interview in Russian . When it was over , Aikman was invited to share an informal family lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by Natalya.
