DREAMGIRLS Book and Lyrics by Tom Eyen <P> Music by Henry Krieger ; Directed and Choreographed by Michael Bennett <P> If Broadway had a book of " begats , " it would read that show biz begat show biz begat show biz . Narcissism can be a powerful intoxicant . It has fueled some remarkable musicals . Think of Gypsy and , more recently , A Chorus Line . Dreamgirls is not quite on that level . Its heart pumps more grease paint than blood . But it demonstrates that you 've got ta have heart just to be in show biz . For every triumph savored , there is a numbing disaster , for every dream a nightmare ; and the everlasting need is to go on striving , surviving , for that is the core of show biz . <P> <P> At times , it seems as if Michael Bennett , the show 's sorcerer , has borrowed Prospero 's wand . He conjures up scenes of potent magic that prove as evanescent as dreams . What is palpably dazzling merges imperceptibly with razzle-dazzle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text . Robin Wagner 's scenic design consists of stark metal , light-crammed towers that move and revolve to form a kaleidoscope of geometric patterns . Costumer Theoni V. Aldredge must have purchased her swatches from a rainbow merchant to fashion the slinky , sequined gowns , and Tharon Musser 's lighting is a palette of explosive colors . <P> Following the lead of Stephen Sondheim 's Sweeney Todd , Bennett opts to develop the story line almost entirely in song , including operatic recitatives . The tale is rather like the saga of the Supremes ' rise from Harlem 's Apollo Theater to top-of-the-pop-charts renown , to gether with the emergence of Diana Ross . <P> Here the Ross figure is known as Deena ( Sheryl Lee Ralph ) , and the Dreams trio is completed by Lorrell ( Loretta Devine ) and Effie ( Jennifer Holliday ) . They sing Krieger and Eyen 's evocative rhythm-and-blues score with impeccable ensemble precision and delightful brio . <P> Holliday is more than a delight . She has devastating vocal firepower and a stage presence that could crumble reinforced concrete . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into an " I quit " - " You 're fired " imbroglio that had her out of Dreamgirls until the pair made up . Near the end of Act I , Effie 's lover ( Ben Harney ) , who is the cynical manager of the trio , replaces her with a slim looker who possesses the svelte image he feels that the Dreams need to captivate white audiences . He has also taken a new bedmate . Partly in lamentation , partly as anathema , Holliday sings And I Am Telling You I 'm Not Going . In her roiling heartbroken fury , she makes it a roof raiser . <P> As galvanic as Holliday is Cleavant Derricks as a slam-bang comic belter sadly beached by new musical tides . A superb choreographer , Bennett is surprisingly skimpy on dances . Only one number , Steppin ' to the Bad Side , fully displays his stylish percussive mastery . But then , the entire evening marches to his drumming beat . <P> - By T.E . Kalaem             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
