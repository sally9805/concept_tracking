Charges of angelic fraud , a verdict of plagiarism <P> The probers in the case may not look anywhere near as fetching as Cheryl Ladd , but all Hollywood last week found itself watching an investigation of a possible major fraud involving television 's popular Charlie 's Angels series . Before the Los Angeles County district attorney were a series of memos and business letters in which a former ABC lawyer reportedly claims that ABC officials and a Hollywood production company participated in a scheme that deprived Screen Stars Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner of more than $500,000 to which the couple were entitled because of their 45% profit rights on Charlie 's Angels . If the district attorney eventually brings a case , it will be the first major criminal fraud charge ever filed as a result of the kind of fee accounting practices that , some insiders claim , are too common in the entertainment industry . The allegations were first reported last week by the New York Times in a front-page story that the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office describes as accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memos were submitted by Attorney Jennifer Martin , 32 , a former ABC lawyer responsible for authorizing the network 's payments to the company that produces Charlie 's Angels , Spelling-Goldberg Productions , owned by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg . Last summer Martin noted that the network was being billed a $30,000 " exclusivity " fee for each episode . The exclusivity label was unusual since ABC already had exclusive rights to the series . Moreover , the amount referred to was in addition to the regular fee of $510,000 per show . When Martin inquired further , an unidentified official at Spelling-Goldberg , one of Hollywood 's most profitable TV production companies , told her that the breakdown of payments was a ruse to diminish the Wagners ' share of the profits . The official also explained to Martin that before the demise of another Spelling-Goldberg program , Starsky and Hutch , $30,000 per episode in Charlie 's Angels fees was diverted to the account of the less successful show , in which the Wagners did not have a share . <P> The memos Martin made of her conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her suspicions to the attention of her superior , ABC Vice President Ronald Sunderland , he gave her the same explanation she had received from the Spelling-Goldberg employee . " They 're doing the Robert Wagners out of their money , " Martin 's memo says Sunderland told her . He assured her that no one in the ABC hierarchy would blow the whistle on the arrangement : " Everyone 's been told that needs to be told , and they 've been told to pay it , and they will pay it . " When Martin later went back to Sunderland to restate her misgivings , he chided her for pursuing the issue . Shortly thereafter , she was fired . <P> The Times expos generated a prompt flurry of denials . ABC said it had paid heed to Martin 's questioning , conducted an internal investigation and found no evidence of wrongdoing . The network submitted its conclusions to the Los Angeles County district attorney . Spelling and Goldberg , in a joint statement , denied the fraud : " We are stunned and outraged by the allegations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the news of the investigation was " a total surprise . "
