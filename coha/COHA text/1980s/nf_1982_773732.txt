txt Cooking , cuisine and class for collecting and compounding medicines ' which give preference to natural constituents , especially those that have a firm link with the past . Just as there are ceremonies in which individuals abandon the modern invention of matches and resort to the earlier technology of the flint blade or the tinder box ' , so too in other ritual contexts they tend to keep alive the knowledge of abandoned or alternative sources of food . What has changed the situation of occasional but recurrent local famines , despite the rapid growth of population ? What indeed has allowed this growth to occur ? One can not say that increased medical facilities have played a very large part , since in most of the rural areas today , hospitals and doctors are few and far between . Moreover , measures of public health , seen as an important factor in the growth of the European population , have hardly made so great in impact over this period . In towns the conditions are often worse than in the country except in residential ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course been effective control of certain epidemics , such as cerebral spinal meningitis , smallpox , cholera , as well as an important programme of biological control of the vectors of sleeping sickness and more recently of river blindness . But medical factors do not in general appear to have had sufficient influence over the population as a whole to have produced such a rapid growth . The cessation of wars and slave-raiding has undoubtedly led to more favourable conditions for the production and preservation of both children and food . But the food supply appears to have increased for other reasons . In many parts of West Africa there has been little change in the techniques of production , in the varieties of crop , in control over water . What then has created a larger food supply ? Improved transport has played its part . The famines caused by lack of rain were often very localised so that the advent of motor vehicles in the early 1920s enabled crops to be moved quickly to affected areas . On a much wider scale , it was the coming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only permitted the export from West Africa of bulky crops such as rubber , palm-oil , and cocoa , but also allowed the import of cheap foodstuffs from abroad . Control over locusts and the cessation of local wars have also been important in increasing productivity . But perhaps the single most important factor has been the availability of cheap iron imported from Europe . In the pre-colonial period iron was manufactured locally over a very wide area , though there were parts where production was more specialised , for example , in the country around Kong visited by Binger where the high chimneys of the furnaces dotted the whole countryside ( 1892 : i , 261 ) . But it was an expensive process ; the ore was lowgrade , the furnaces crude and the charcoal difficult to make . 1 lence the basic tool of production , the hoe blade , was expensive . I have been Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja told that it could cost the equivalent of a cow , and I have heard of families without the resources to buy blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for an energetic spell with a single tool . The impact of lowcost blades must have been enormous , for the local industry collapsed almost overnight . I have never seen iron smelted in the region ( though there is an extended description in the Myth of the Bagre ) , yet the remains of workings are everywhere . When I was in the region at the end of 1978 and beginning of 1979 , imported blades were no longer getting to the markets . The worn remnants of old blades were on sale , as they must have been in pre-colonial times ; and there was a certain amount of local production from scrap metal . But one could see the enormous extent to which the whole process of production now depended on the importation of cheap iron . The import of cheap iron and the cessation of local wars and raids were the most significant factors in improving the food supply and in increasing the size of the population . Both were related to the advent of bulk trade with Europe and de facto with the coming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most produce was consumed where it was grown , so that the crops and livestock corresponded to the major elements of the diet ; what was grown was largely consumed within the locality , and much of it within the group of people who produced it . There were few exotics ' , apart from salt , kola nuts and meat coming in and shea-butter going out . The transport of goods was largely limited to head-loading by humans , often slaves , which inhibited the bulk movement of foodstuffs ; the tsetse has made animal transport impossible in the forest , where chiefs and white men had to be carried in hammocks or palanquins . In the savannah regions , donkeys were used but their capacity was small . Horses carried only humans , though in the Sahelian regions on the desert borders , camels were employed as carriers of both men and goods . But the major restriction was the failure to adapt the wheel for local use . The food items of high value carried along the trade routes of West Africa in pre-colonial times were animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cattle , sheep and goats ) , some for transport ( horses , donkeys , camels and ostriches ) . The stimulant kola nut , coming from the forest zone , played an important part in trade ( Lovejoy 1973 ) , being chewed over a wide area of the savannah and entering into numerous ceremonials , especially in areas influenced by Islam where the usual liquid accompaniments of offerings to supernatural agencies , that is , gin or palm wine in the forest and millet beer in the savannahs , were 61 Cooking , cuisine and class discouraged because of their alcoholic content . Some shea-butter travelled from the north , where it was used for cooking oil , to the south where it was used as a pomade or skin cream . But the major feature of the long-distance trade in ingestibles was certainly salt , that most widespread of human trade goods.13 While the LoDagaa are able to make an alkaline equivalent out of burnt ashes , salt constituted their only major food import from outside the region , paralleling the role of cloth in the non-food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoration and as ritual , fall in another more general category , but were of course imported from even further afield . The singular importance of salt as an import is illustrated in the Myth of the Bagre , where a standardised tale tells how a salt-trader had lost his way . Following the noise of the music at the Bagre Dance , he came across the settlement where it was being performed and sold its inhabitants the salt they needed for the meal being prepared for the new initiates and for their seniors . Other items for the ceremony also had to be bought in the local market ? some meat , some grain , some oil ? but these are all local products and , had it not been for the amount required , they could have been provided from the resources of the house itself . Nevertheless it should be insisted that local markets in food were characteristic of this part of Africa , and these are well described by Binger in his travels through the area in 1888 ? 9 . Markets were essential not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of individuals in the settlements themselves . If one was called upon to make an offering or a sacrifice , to entertain a stranger , to brew beer or carry out a ceremony , one did not necessarily have sufficient of the right food available at the right moment . Market exchange of foodstuffs supplemented subsistence production in this way , although it is clearly more important today when many individuals are withdrawn from the process of food production in order to fill other jobs such as teacher , policeman , administrator , and so on . The consumption of food , then , was essentially the consumption of the crops grown in the immediate vicinity . In times of shortage people would sometimes go to collect grain from the family of their mother ( mamine or madebmine , mother 's brother ' ) , but the reaction to famine was often the movement of people rather than the movement of food . Meat , especially game , had a somewhat wider radius than other foods . Among the LoDagaa the search for wild animals often led outside the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously correlated with the density of wild animals . In Gonja , where the population was very thin ( a total of 118,000 even in 1960 , giving a density of 8.2 per sq . mile ) , there was much more activity , especially by individual hunters , some of whom did little else in the dry 62 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja season . At Gbuipe in 1956 ? 7 the meat was often dried and sold to Ashanti traders ( among whom the most important was a woman ) who then had it head-loaded to the nearest road junction where it was taken by lorry to Kumasi , the capital of Ashanti ( population 260,000 in 1970 ) . The extent of these exports is certainly new ; livestock are trucked down in lorries and the yams , maize and ground-nuts form part of the bulk trade in foodstuffs from north to south . But even in pre-colonial times , meat travelled from the north , and the ruler of Ashanti had snails brought to him from the forests of Ahafo ( Dunn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were delicacies , like the imported tea and sugar Binger found in the market of Salaga in 1888 , which were the counterparts of the kola nut then being imported into Europe to flavour wine and biscuits , and valued because of its medicinal properties as it had been by the Arabs for at least seven centuries.14 But meat was in itself a delicacy ; hence its importance in Gonja political relations , where it was transferred between subject and ruler outside the immediate locality , at least up to the divisional chief who received a portion of the proceeds of hunting expeditions , the left front leg of each animal killed , as well as part of each catch of fish , while a tusk of each elephant went in principle to the paramount himself . Even among the tribal peoples such as the LoDagaa , local markets in food were important features of pre-colonial life . While the markets in Gonja came under political control , these were generally under the religious aegis of the Master of the Earth . Here beer was drunk , chickens were purchased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to brew beer ) , cooked food was on sale ; here too one could buy pots for cooking , vats for making beer , calabashes for the kitchen , hoes and hoe handles for the farm . Goods of all kinds were purchased for cowries , a form of shell-money . In Gonja , on the other hand , the markets were fewer but more varied ; the items on sale included larger animals , goods from Ashanti and beyond , slaves , and gold which acted both as a commodity and as a medium of exchange , as salt did in the Sahelian region . As far as food was concerned , even in the market towns most inhabitants had their own farms on which slave labour played its part . But large caravans of strangers , especially those engaged in the kola trade with Hausaland , required feeding , so that the market had to cater either to their needs directly , or more usually to the needs of the landlords whose responsibility they were . It has been reckoned that during the dry season the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival of caravans . The markets among the Gonja and LoDagaa were formerly very different . The Gonja market of Salaga was essentially an export as well as .1 local market , carrying on a vigorous entrepot trade , with goods and 63 Cooking , cuisine and class merchants travelling between Ashanti in the south and from Hausaland and other territories , to the north . The local basis of all the markets in foodstuffs was similar ( and is so today ) , the great difference being the active trade in cloth among the Gonja , in and out of the market-place , a commodity for which the LoDagaa , like most of the acephalous tribal peoples , had little use . While there was a market in foodstuffs and in human beings , there was none in land ; that was extra commercium as indeed was the labour of free men , 15 for there is no record or recollection of wage labour . The market principle ' was certainly in evidence but its application was restricted partly because most food was produced and consumed within the unit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be difficult to detail the role of gift-giving in the distribution of food without going into a lengthy analysis of the social organisation . Among the LoDagaa , prestations of raw produce , as distinct from cooked food , are made not only to sustain the important initiation ceremonies of the Bagre association but also at every funeral , where the chief mourner has to distribute a basket of grain to some of those who have attended ( Goody 1962 : 161 ) . Livestock are also part of the funeral transfers , but even more important in this respect are the enormously valuable bridewealth transactions in cattle made in the course of a marriage . In Gonja , such prestations are perhaps no less frequent but lower in value ; the funeral distribution is one of cooked food , and marriage payments are low . The part played by food in accumulation by chiefs was not large , as we have seen , but there is another category of transfers , which partake of the character both of gifts and of centric transfers . Among Muslims in Gonja , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even for marriage prestations . But its more usual meaning refers to gifts made in God 's name . These can be charitable gifts to help build a mosque . Nowadays the old-style Sudanese mosques are sometimes felt to be inadequate monuments to God , and a rich trader , grown wealthy on modern developments , may give funds to build a concrete construction , as has happened recently in Bole . But every year at Ashura ( the fire festival ) , the leading Muslims of a town pray to God that the chief will be generous to them during the coming year , making them presents worthy of God 's servants . Such requests are made at the time when the Book of Years is read out , the book that prophesies what will happen during the course of the next twelve moons . The requests are extravagant ; today , Muslim traders are more likely to provide financial support for the indigent chief , in expectation of reciprocal help of a different kind , rather than vice versa . But Muslims themselves do make gifts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope vie with the munificent gifts that built up the great complexes of 64 Productioh and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja hospitals , schools and markets surrounding the splendid mosques of Istanbul . Every Friday , a neighbour of ours in Kpembe bought some bean cakes from a woman in the town , took them back to his compound , where he offered prayers to God , and then called out , Yara , yara , yara ' . In a few minutes he was surrounded by young children come to collect the cakes . Giving in God 's name to the poor or to little children is an act which brings religious grace . Giving alms is a peripheral part of Muslim life in Gonja , substituting in one context for the blood sacrifices and offerings that , if not forbidden , are at least downgraded in Islam . As with Christianity , one of the effects of the universalistic , written religion is the tendency to shift the direction of material offerings , which are less likely to be buried with the dead or offered on an altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , either to be accumulated by his trained servants or else distributed as alms to the poor . Other forms of gift-giving do exist in Gonja . The greeting ' of chiefs and elders , as described by Esther Goody ( 1972 ) , involves the transfer of kola ( often used as the general word for such gifts ) , drink ( used in a similar way among the LoDagaa ) and meat . The same kinds of gifts are offered when a man is seeking a wife , a chiefly office or favour , or the reparation of a broken relationship . Cooked food is provided at all rites de passage , and the preparation of large quantities of porridge for distribution to those attending is a conspicuous feature of the ceremonies centred upon the life-cycle . The storage of food was quite efficient , though among the LoDagaa shortages did develop towards the beginning of the next harvest , so that an effort had to be made to distribute the food evenly over the year , after separating off next year 's seed . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than the grain , and so spread the harvesting over a longer part of the year . The LoDagaa kept their grain in specially-built granaries at the end of the long room , the main room of the house . These large granaries were carefully cleaned to prevent pests from eating the grain , and a fire was sometimes built at their base , which had the effect of keeping the contents dry . Only the head of the household had access to the main granary , though he could ask a small boy to climb down to get out the grain needed either for daily use or for some special ceremony . The head would then call his wives , his sons ' wives , that is , all those entitled to a portion , and allocate a similar amount to each one , per stirpes . The regularity of the distribution varied according to the season . After the harvest it might be every three days , but later on every six . With this ration , and any supplements they might themselves be able to provide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained responsible for providing salt and meat in addition . Among the Gonja , at least today , things are not very different except 65 Cooking , cuisine and class that crops are normally stored in the fields , i.e. at some distance from the village ; it is from there that the head of the household distributes his yams or his grain , while cassava is normally dug up when required . Gonja , however , was a centralised state , with its courts , officials , chiefs , some of whom did not do much by way of farming . In the states of Europe and Asia , farmers were made to contribute part of their product as taxes to the central authority , as rent to local landowners , or both . As in the rest of Africa , there was no rent for land in Gonja . Nor was a man expected regularly to contribute part of his produce either to a political or to a religious authority . Of course , men gave both food and livestock for religious purposes , but not as a tithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited kind , apart from the produce provided by their own households . It is true that in many commoner villages Gonja chiefs enjoyed the right to receive a portion of the palm wine collected , the fish caught , a leg of the wild animals killed and of the domestic animals sacrificed . They might also receive food ( and perhaps some farm labour ) from their subjects , and would attempt to extract larger amounts if they were asked to make judicial decisions . But this tribute was limited in quantity and sometimes appeared to . be more a token of political hierarchy than an economic privilege . While it could become exploitative , such tribute was more often recognised as a proper measure of support for an individual who had to entertain strangers and look after the affairs of the village . Even if the chief had accumulated a large amount of foodstuffs as the result of his command of force , given the means of transport available and the nature of the demand , he could not dispatch this surplus to the market unless it was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redistribution were few . In any case most market towns were agro-towns ' producing what they required by means of their own labour and that of their slaves . ' One type of transaction , much emphasised in the accounts of pre-industrial states , is redistribution ' of which we need to distinguish two forms . There is the immediate redistribution characteristic of feasts and gift-giving , whereby what is received is at once handed out , where the chief or central institution serves as a focus for accumulation and then for dispersal . And there is the delayed redistribution that Joseph carried out for Pharaoh by accumulating grain in years of plenty in order to redistribute it in the lean years . This latter form of redistribution is not a notable feature of present-day Gonja , though it doubtless occurred in earlier times . But it featured prominently in some of the colonial developments in the less centralised tribal ' societies . In such societies the degree of political centralisation was by definition low ; leaders arose in the context of specific activities , better-off men 66 Production and consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no chiefship of the kind found in the neighbouring states , vested in a ruling group who controlled the means of coercion , the means of destruction . The advent of colonial government brought these independent peoples within the orbit of a larger state which needed local representatives to assist in the administration . Chiefs and headmen became essential instruments of colonial overrule , and were appointed , elected or emerged in every settlement . Since there was no model for this new role inside the community , both government and appointees looked outside . In some areas the new chiefs asked their subjects for help , since they were assisting their fellows in dealing with the invaders . The help consisted in carrying out the same kind of services to which chiefs has long been entitled in the states , namely work on their farm , corvee labour , some tribute in kind . In this way not only was the new chief able to maintain a large household , but he could use part of the produce he had acquired to sell in the market since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foodstuffs to urban areas . The rest was stored in his granaries against a future emergency , or simply to help those villagers who were in need . This is what happened in Birifu ; men were asked to come and farm for the chief ( a practice long since abandoned , except on a minute scale ) , and in return he offered them not only beer , but help in dealing with the Europeans as well as providing them with a reserve against hunger and starvation . Potentially his granary served the whole village . Just the same reasons were given to me this past year by a well-off and educated chief when he was defending the immense acreage of rice which he had now brought under mechanised cultivation ; his own household alone required 300 bags of rice a year , quite apart from the needs of the poor . Thus some acephalous ' societies suddenly achieved a degree of centric accumulation from the labour of the farmers , and in some cases this seems to have been greater than in the states themselves . It enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I counted 33 at the funeral of Chief Gandaa in Birifu , and Chiefs Kayanni of Tugu and Karbo of Lawra were equally well endowed ; they were much better provided for than anyone in Gonja , including the paramount himself . It enabled them to influence the course of events and to produce huge families ? the Chief of Birifu had at least 200 children , the educated among whom are now important figures in the elite of the region . But there was not at this stage any tendency to develop different styles of life ; from the domestic standpoint the new chiefs lived just like everyone else , but with more of everything . 67 Cooking , cuisine and class It had earlier been the same in the older , traditional states . None of the traditional chiefs had very different styles of life from other members of the state , at least as far as cuisine was concerned . While they had more food , it was of the same kind . Only with regard to meat was there some difference in distribution , here as among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes , were entitled to special portions of the animal killed , and while not all of this was intended for the named recipient who had to display the generosity that seniority requires , he certainly obtained the major part . Since sacrifice and killing were male tasks , there was also a considerable difference in the distribution between the sexes . The same disparity exists today . Even when the meat does get into the common soup , I have known educated women wait until the men had taken their portion before helping themselves , though men also jokingly claim that if women do not help themselves beforehand , they are fools . More usually , women of both societies distribute the cooked meat in bowls , giving the larger portions to the men . Children are little affected by any such discrimination , at least while they eat with their mother ; only when boys join the male eating group does this difference impinge directly on their lives . While women feed young children irrespective of sex , they may not necessarily feed them equally , at least after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sons rather than daughters , women may themselves be the instruments of their own subordination by giving larger portions of choice foods to their male offspring . Other parts of the world provide definite evidence of differential treatment of children by sex which is reflected in comparative figures on mortality . Data from India and from China show that the trend of infant mortality ran against the general experience of human populations where the male , though more numerous at birth , is more subject to disease in the early years of life . In India and China ( Taiwan ) , on the contrary , it is the female children who are most vulnerable , just as in earlier times they sometimes were liable to infanticide ( Barclay 1954 ) . It is in keeping with our general hypothesis , suggested in a number of other publications ( Goody 1976 ; Goody et al . 1977 , 1981a , 1981b ) that differential treatment of children is not a significant feature of African society ; we did not find any evidence of sex preference in the distribution of offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Addo and Goody 1974 ) , nor is there any evidence of differential treatment of young children on the medical side , a difference that might take the form of the willingness of a parent to go further to get medical attention for a son than for a daughter . In this significant feature Africa differed from Asia , in a way that directly relates to the respective systems of stratification . 68 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja PREPARATION The main focus of the sociology of cooking and of eating is plainly the processes of preparation and consumption . If we have spent some time on the two previous phases , it is because we see them not only as intimately linked but as explaining certain general features of African cooking , which we shall place in a very broad contrast to the cuisines of the major Eurasian societies . The preparation of the meal , in Africa as elsewhere , is often a long and time-consuming process . " I refer here not so much to the male task of cutting up the meat but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make oil , or turning the dangerous cassava into a safe food . While cereals are stored as grain ( and without being threshed ) , other foods are dried to make them last ; the fruit of the okra , pepper and soup leaves are all laid out on the roofs in the sun before being packed away in pots and baskets for the empty season . Among the LoDagaa , grain is sometimes stored in its malted form to be used for brewing beer at a later date . Once again the whole process is in the hands of women , who buy the grain , process it in the complicated way required to make the beer which they sell either in the market-place or more often in their own homes . Some women nowadays make malted grain for sale to others who run permanent beer bars in the market or in administrative settlements . The preparation of a meal normally takes a long time because the produce has to be transformed directly from its natural state . In the case of guinea-corn or millet , the grain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ground in a mortar or on a stone slab to produce flour . The grinding is especially hard , and women sometimes try to lighten their work by singing songs and chatting amongst themselves . Neither here nor in drawing water , nor yet in making pots , did they have the help of the wheel . It is perhaps small wonder that the most conspicuous new feature of many villages , apart from the bicycle and the occasional gun , is the grinding mill , established by some enterprising trader and run by means of a diesel motor . Here women queue up to have their grain ground into flour , preferring to try and earn a little extra money in the market or by brewing beer , rather than undertake the heavy work of grinding by hand . It is easy to see what a dominant position the ownership of a mill gave to a landlord , or other investor , in the European Middle Ages , quite apart from the monopoly he claimed . The application of wind or water power for the processing of grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the advantage of the rotary quern . The mill is a labour-saving device of great 69 Cooking , cuisine and class significance , for which women themselves are prepared to pay by additional work of a less demanding ( but possibly more time-taking ) kind . The technology of food preparation , then , is complex , even in the simplest agricultural societies , and it lies largely in the hands of women ; it is they who have the knowledge ( nooro be nooro , working their wonders ' , as it is called in the Myth of the Bagre ) to undertake these tasks , the making of soap , the extraction of oil , the brewing of beer , the preparation of cassava , and indeed the whole process of applying heat to the raw products in order to turn them into a meal , the process of cooking . I do not know of any LoDagaa tales about the origin of fire . Certainly it plays no part so far in the Myth of the Bagre , where virtually all other techniques of human life are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beings of the wild show mankind how to grow grain and cook porridge , but in contrast to many societies of Europe , Asia and of South America , the invention of fire is passed over in virtual silence . The maintenance of fire is in the hands of women ; they fetch the firewood , get a light to start it , and keep it going for as long as they need . Nowadays , they can start from scratch using matches . Formerly if a light was not available , they would have to call a male to make fire using a stone , a piece of iron and some kapok , a procedure that is still occasionally used for ritual purposes . As far as I know there was no ritual attached to the lighting of the fire itself . Like yeast , fire was one of those marvels passed down from hand to hand , the embodiment of communal living , difficult to start , easy to keep going , especially if one has kin and neighbours on whom to rely . And in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon such cooperative activities than the man 's . The hearth generally consists of three stones on top of which the pots are balanced , a separate hearth for each pot . Virtually all the food cooked by women is boiled . Since there are no ovens ( except for new bread ovens in market towns ) , baking is difficult . Fish and meat are occasionally smoked above the fire for preservation . Some frying is done , more often in the market where delicacies such as bean cakes are offered for sale . Corn cobs are sometimes roasted , but roasting is a form of cooking that does not require a hearth , and which is more usually carried out by men . They will roast special portions of the meat after a sacrifice , while young boys may put a cob of maize over a fire or roast some of the smaller animals they catch as part of their play ' . But while roasting is an important adjunct to ritual , it plays little part in domestic cooking per se which falls determinedly in the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja In his cross-cultural survey of the status of women , Whyte notes that of all the economic ' variables considered , it is only in the area of housekeeping that there is a definite bias towards one sex ( i.e. the female one ) ; while work outside the home tends to vary very widely from one culture to another throughout the world work within the home tends to be predominantly done by women ' ( 1978 : 68 ) . We can add a comment on the relation between cooking and gender as well as between cooking and sex . In human societies generally cooking is seen as part of women 's role . That is not to deny that men may carry out other functions in the preparation of food . They are generally the killers of other animals ( and of other men ) as well as the butchers of domestic meat . Moreover they often play a part in the roasting as distinct from the boiling of meat , in cooking in the fields or forest as distinct from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . All these aspects can be illustrated from an initiatory ceremony for a diviner that I attended recently in Birifu ( January 1979 ) . On the previous day a number of chickens , a goat and a dog had been sacrificed by the participants , who consisted only of men . On the second day , more chickens were killed , the feathers removed , and the flesh roasted by one of the younger men on a fire built outside the compound ; this meat was immediately eaten by those of us sitting round . The rest of the raw flesh of the animals was divided up among those present , some portions being set aside for the pot . Another fire was made , this time at a hearth of stones , and cooking pots were filled with water . When the skin of the animals had been removed , the innards and parts of the flesh were boiled up in the water . On another fireplace , porridge ( saab ) was prepared , initially by the men but later assisted by one woman . Into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled meat , each pair of pots being shared between two men ; the same portions were given to the few women who had helped , though they did not , I think , receive any meat of the dog which is normally forbidden to women . The dog is associated with the exclusively male activity of hunting , whose exclusivity is emphasised by the prohibitions on sexual contact with women before the hunt , for fear of displaying non-manly qualities in the face of danger . It is in the context of the hunt and in war that the opposition to the domestic work of women is most intense . The division of labour is not so heavily reinforced in agriculture where women play a part that varies between societies . The major contrast lies between men killing and women bearing , nurturing and cooking .

One accompanying explanation ' runs : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas the woman gets the meal ready when he returns . In fact men usually return from farming long before , but it is at dusk that the main meal is served . In the morning a man will take little to eat before going off , some ground-nuts or a portion of last night 's food . And it is rare that he will have any cooked food in the middle of the day , especially if he is working in the bush farms , though special farming parties will sometimes have food brought to them in the fields . Most of the year , of course , a man is around the compound or at least nearby in the settlement , and it is easier for him to get back to eat . But in most households , it is the evening meal that counts , though the children are fed more often . During the course of the day a man will eat snacks , and among the LoDagaa he will often drink beer when he returns from the farm at one of the compounds where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sociology of cooking without discussing drink . By and large , drinking and eating are seen as separate activities , not ones that take place concurrently ( as when drinking wine with a meal ) nor even in the same place . For example , the palm wine of Ashanti was drunk when the men came back from the forest . Outside the forest belt , where , since the coming of the European , palm wine was often distilled into spirits , it was beer that constituted the main beverage , other of course than water . In different parts of . the grassland of West and East Africa , beer is made from a whole range of cereal products , sorghum , maize , as well as from bananas . It also varies greatly in density and in sweetness . In Ruanda , honey is added , making a brew of heavy consistency . Among the LoDagaa , it is lighter and sharper , more like cider than mead . In both cases the process is similar to that used in the making of European ale.18 But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is to say , the LoDagaa often apply the same term to beer as they do to the basic cereal element of the meal , porridge , namely the word bundire , derived from bun , thing and dire , eating . Interestingly , this word is not applied to meat ( nen ) , which is chewed ( . nr ) rather than eaten ( di ) . The reason is not very far to seek , since beer and porridge are made from the same basic ingredient , namely sorghum . The phrase beer is food ' , dad ni bundire , was once used by the headman of Tom , Nibe , when he was explaining to me the difficulties of his domestic life . For some reason , probably to do with sex , his wife had refused to cook for him , and he told me that he had been subsisting for many days on beer alone ( though this was not altogether true ) . Beer that has not been imprisoned in bottles and impregnated with gas does not keep long , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritive elements 72 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja present in the cereal , supplemented by the vitamin B of the yeast . It is in fact as adequate a food as porridge . As in the case with other peoples influenced by Islam , the Gonja rarely drink beer , for which on ritual occasions they substitute the kola nut . But it is produced for some ceremonial occasions , especially at offerings to the Earth shrine , since it is known to please the ancestors of the autochthones . For similar reasons it is used by the commoner diviners ( lejipo ) in their various ceremonies . And while it is sold in some of the bigger market towns , the producers are generally strangers . The LoDagaa also pour libations of beer at ceremonies , and no major sacrifice , funeral or performance of the Bagre would be complete without it . Beer is essential for every occasion when one invites friends or affines to come and farm , or to help build a house . Even those operating in the new economy ? teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer to those who work on their houses or farms . You do not pay for the labour of free men . You offer them beer ( and food , if they are affines ) and expect help in return , but you also are expected to reciprocate on a similar occasion . It is the reciprocity that is lacking in many of the modern situations , so that it becomes increasingly difficult for non-farmers to get labour , unless they make it very clear that a substantial return will be forthcoming . Individuals are increasingly reluctant to engage in a one-way flow of labour services in return for food and drink , when this benefits not the local chief but a distant kinsman already earning good wages . I have known of fortunes ' built up by employing labour in this way . And while the balance of favours is rarely clear cut , a perception of continuing inequality ( implicit in the process of development ) leads to a reluctance to follow the same path . Apart from ceremonies , LoDagaa drink beer in the ordinary course of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brewed by one 's own wife , in which case it is paid for as anywhere else , because it has been with her grain , grain that she was given by kin whom she helped at harvest time , that she has saved in bits and pieces , or that she has purchased in the market-place , often travelling to distant settlements to buy more cheaply . Women walk a long way to save quite small amounts of money , partly for the adventure of attending other market places , always the scene of plenty of activity . The distance they travel has doubtless increased since the pre-colonial period , since it is now safer and easier to move ; but the fact that the days of the week are named , as elsewhere in West Africa , after a set of neighbouring markets ( six in the LoI ) agaa case , some of them long since disappeared ) is evidence enough of earlier circulation . Weekly time is market time . Beer can be purchased in any of the LoDagaa markets ; indeed some 73 Cooking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( zaanuora daa ) , seem to exist only for the sale of beer and cooked food ? the market of Birifu ( known as Wa daa ) remains of this kind despite the efforts of successive chiefs to try and stimulate activity . But while markets are held weekly and often lie at some distance , beer is brewed every day at some house in the lineage or section area . Women themselves disperse their days of sale over the six-day week , so that everyone knows that today Brumo will be brewing , that tomorrow it will be Popla ( White Woman ) , and so forth . When a man comes back from the fields , he may send his wife to one of these houses to buy a pot , or more likely he will walk across himself , partly for the company , partly because he will pay by the calabash . The sequence of events is well illustrated in the section of the Myth of the Bagre which tells how a man and his son went off to look for termite mounds to bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them scoops up a ripe shea fruit ( the nut used for oil is surrounded by a tasty fruit ) which is the sign that the time to start Bagre has arrived . On reaching the house , his wife comes out to collect the basket he has been carrying . The Myth continues : The knowledgeable father lay down there under the big tree , and when they came back , the knowledgeable mother took his load and hurried back to the big tree and put it on the ground . There and then , the knowledgeable father , he it was who asked the wife to go in the room and fetch some water for them to drink . The thoughtful one heard all that , and then she said , Your lover 's beer is on sale today . He said to her , Go in the room and take five cowries and bring them to me . You heard that , 74 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja and turning round ( she ) entered the room , took out five cowries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out with it . At the beer house they had put aside the beer . Now their thirst was killing them and they left for his lover 's house.19 The woman comes out to greet her husband , who sits down and is brought some water to drink , the treatment more typically shown to a stranger . Water is the first greeting ' made to a stranger , unless beer is immediately available ; and often it is water into which a little flour has been mixed . Now that we have drunk , let us greet , ' is a frequently heard remark , indicating that the verbal exchange of greetings and information should attend this act of hospitality , an act that turns the alien individual into a stranger ' to whom obligations attach , the principal of which is to provide him with food for a limited period . After three days ' , runs a Sierra Leonean proverb , you give him the hoe , ' so that he becomes a producer as well as a consumer . Among the Bedouin , a host 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meal remained in his belly . Among the LoDagaa , too , the consumption of the produce of a particular parish , the ritual area whose inhabitants are forbidden to shed each other 's blood on pain of heavy sacrifice to avoid the inevitable retribution of supernatural agencies , places the alien within the jurisdiction of the Earth shrine . Indeed one does not even need to consume food . My friend Bonyiri once told me that if I was visiting another parish where the people seemed hostile , I should bend down , take up a pinch of earth , and put it in my mouth in full view of everyone . In this way I placed myself under the protection of the local shrine and people would be afraid to harm me . The term lover ' in the Bagre account is my translation of the LoDagaa sen , which does not always carry the sexual implications of that word ; on the other hand it has a somewhat stronger sense than the Yorkshire love ' as a term of address . In the context of drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot for you on the days she is selling . For men have regular places they will go , meet their friends and talk about this and that . This beer house may be anyone 's house , and it is the resident woman rather than the man who is important in this context . When people collect together , it inevitably becomes the place where you get to 75 Cooking , cuisine and class know what is going on . If you arrive alone , you climb to the rooftop , or enter the long room if it is cold , then sit down on a low stool at the edge of the small group drinking their beer . One always sits down when eating or drinking . In the centre a woman sits on the floor , her feet stretched out in front , pouring the beer which is balanced upon a head pad ( tasir ) . First she scoops off the yeasty froth on the top and sets aside the first calabash for herself . Then she pours for her clients , one of whom may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay calabash by calabash . The beer is drunk slowly , with the calabash held in the right hand , the thumb being kept clear of the liquid ; some people will never drink the beer from a calabash after another person has drunk out of it , and if you are asked to pass a calabash of beer to your neighbour , it is polite to take a sip beforehand , just to show you are not passing on a poisoned draught . A woman of the house , or one who is passing by , may be called over to join the group , and formerly a man and woman who were lovers would drink together out of the same calabash , pressing their cheeks together as they did so . It is a sign of friendship that is disappearing , being regarded as unhygienic by those who have attended school . The last calabash containing the dregs ought to be shown to the man who owns the pot , that is , the person who has paid for it , or to whom it has been presented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other societies , the offering of drinks works by rough reciprocity ; everybody soon knows who does not pay their round and remarks are made ; on subsequent occasions one may avoid that company . The quality of the beer and the quality of the company will vary from place to place , so that men will have their favourite rendezvous . A good brewer will gain much renown and much respect ; when migrants return to Birifu , they often drop down to see Brumo , who , though she has now given up brewing because of old age , likes to see her former customers from time to time . Such a woman can become quite well off by local standards but the work is hard ? collecting firewood , fetching water , going to market for grain , then the long process of turning the grain into malt , grinding the malted grain when one is ready to brew , then cooking it for two days before it is drunk on the third . At the present time specialist beer shops , extensions of the house pattern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a man who , when going overseas for a course , gave his wife the money required to buy a load of firewood , the grain and the pots so that she could set up as a brewer and feed the children while he was away ( though in this case he never returned to her after completing his education ) . In Babile , a small market and junction town , several women will share a house , each woman brewing every three days 76 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja in order to provide a constant supply . These are often feme sole with no men around ; either they have left their husbands or they have been left . These beer shops they run represent a much more commercialised operation than the village brewing , which still continues as vigorously as before . Local beer remains very much part of the LoDagaa diet , even if those who can afford to do so have turned their attention to bottled beer , brewed in the south , which is at once stronger , less nutritious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of market or administrative centres , who sometimes bring back a supply when they return to the village . Manners of the Table ' are less in evidence for eating than for drinking . The table of course does not exist . Bowls containing soup and porridge are laid in front of the senior man , while others bring their stools ( or squat if they are boys ) and join in eating out of the same pot . In Gonja , influenced by Islam , water will first be brought to wash one 's hands , a practice that is becoming more common among the LoDagaa . Eating is carried out using the forefingers and thumb of the right hand ; first collecting a piece of porridge , the hand is dipped in the relish and then quickly conveyed to the mouth . Meat is picked out and chewed separately . In centralised societies the holders of high office were sometimes given special protection ' in their eating , being hidden from the public gaze , possibly for fear of witchcraft , sorcery or other form of evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief sitting in the manager 's office of a hotel . At my suggestion that it was time we ate , he was reluctant to go into the restaurant where many of our friends and acquaintances were sitting , remarking that chiefs do not eat in public ; in the end we chose a side table and ate there . The reluctance was even more notable in this case , since the chief was not a representative of an ancient state but of a hierarchy that had its roots in the colonial regime ; nevertheless even the newly created chiefs of formerly acephalous ' ( or tribal ' or non-state ) societies take as their model the formal patterns of behaviour characteristic of the old kingdoms . That is what chiefship is about . A chief might have to eat special foods , as in the extreme case of the Yoruba king who had to consume the heart of his predecessor . In Gonja , the senior chiefs , and indeed the heads of dynastic segments ( or gates ' ) , were required to eat the food prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain the liver of a human being . Such limited cannibalism ' , in fact an inversion of the practice of eating human flesh , was quite widespread in West Africa , for the purification of a homicide ( Goody 1962 : 115 ) . It constituted a rejection rather than an acceptance of cannibalism. 77 Cooking , cuisine and class The ordinary meal consists of the one dish ; there are no starters , no afters ; no hors d'oeuvre , no dessert . It consists of a single but filling dish , un plat unique . Moreover , among the LoDagaa , that dish is basically the same from day to day ? porridge made from guinea-corn or millet , and accompanied by a soup , usually made from ground-nuts ( bule zier ) or leaves ( e.g. hire zier ) of one type or another . In Gonja , by contrast , yams form the basis for part of the year and grains and cassava for the rest , while more fish and wild meat are evident in the relish . If there is little variation day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet , with no special days for special foods , except for meat on festivals . The alternation is a seasonal one . But ever here the most important variation was one of quantity , less being available at the end of the year . Given the limitations of the diet , one would not expect great emphasis to be placed on fasting . In Gonja , the restrictions of the month of Ramadan are only observed by the most zealous Muslims . Feasting too is a matter of more of the same ( but especially more meat ) rather than an occasion for meals making use of different constituents , as is the case with , for example , Simnel cakes , Christmas puddings and with Hot Cross buns . A feast is a time of plenty rather than a time of difference . The Gonja speak of festivals as a time when even the children are satisfied ' . There is one important context of LoDagaa life , when abstinence is encouraged and certain foods are forbidden ( chiru , tabooed ) , then later allowed , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens every year at first fruit ceremonies , in Gonja and among the LoDagaa , when abstinence is followed by indulgence . In Gonja new yams ( which are linked to gbandau ) are not eaten until the proper ceremony has been performed . The New Yam Ceremony does not have the same religious and political significance as among the Ashanti , where it was for the Odwera festival that subordinate chiefs and tributary princes came to the capital Kumasi , to do obeisance to the king , to settle disputes and to perform the festival in all its glory.20 Among the Gonja , the Muslim calendar that encapsulates in the lunar year the whole life span of the Prophet , has been imposed on top of the round of seasonal activity . The major festival of the Gonja liturgical year , which was no longer seasonal , since the Islamic calendar is based upon a count of twelve lunar months rather than upon the solar cycle , was the Damba ceremony to which we have already referred . At this time , chiefs came to greet their superior , disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves watching the display and taking part in the dancing . But the ceremonies were necessarily divorced from the appearance of the new crop , from any kind of Thanksgiving Ceremony for the first fruits . This role was left to the New Yam Ceremony where 78 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja minor offerings were made to the dead and where the important rituals of chiefship connected with the renewal of the power of war medicines were performed ; in earlier days it was not a time for strangers to be abroad . A more elaborate version of the New Yam Ceremony , however , was performed at one village in Gonja , that of Kalande near Salaga . This was a village of gunmen of Akan origin ; indeed they claim to have fled from Techiman before the Ashanti advance and to have offered themselves as warriors to the Gonja state . However this may be , they still speak an Akan language and perform Akan ceremonies . At the festival the huge umbrellas beloved by the Akan are much in evidence ; yams are mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely of the Akan pattern , for this mixture ( et ) ) is the food of the gods as well as of humans . Among the LoDagaa , the first fruits ceremony is the occasion for brewing beer ( Bagmaaldaa ) to the shrines in a man 's house , at which time they are adorned with samples of the new crop , principally guinea-corn . The ceremony is performed during the dry season after the Bagre ceremonies have finished , but on a house-to-house basis , and on different days . In 1979 , it was around mid January that many households in Birifu brewed beer , made the offerings , sacrificed a fowl or two , and invited others to come and drink . Both these ceremonies involve thanks to the deities for a successful harvest , but there is also some idea of abstinence from eating the new crop until these thanks have been given , though I can not say the prohibitions are observed very strictly . Among the LoDagaa the serious prohibitions are found elsewhere , in the Bagre ceremony . Some of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bagre of Beans , the Yam Ceremony , and so forth . All involve the lifting of prohibitions on eating certain foods that are laid down either at the start or in the course of the ceremonies . The series begins with the Announcement of Bagre , and , as the story of the guinea fowl and his mate tells us , it is the ripening of the shea fruit that sets the date . This is because the new entrants have to be released from the prohibitions on this fruit by eating it in a formal way , otherwise they will be in danger . The words of the old man , when he finds the ripe shea nut , are repeated as a refrain throughout the recitation : The fire blazes up . If we do n't act , the children will sin.21 In the weeks that follow , the various ceremonies lift the prohibitions that have been placed upon the eating of bean-leaf soup , of black beans 7 ' ) Cooking , cuisine and class ( bean cakes ) , of yams , of ground-nut soup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , but that on food is the most salient because the cancellation of the prohibitions takes the form of a public demonstration . That is to say , it takes the form of eating a meal in which what was forbidden now becomes permitted , an affirmation of the symbolic ' value , the social ' value , the value of the particular constituents as well as of food in general . For Bagre is very much about feasting and drinking . The sponsors of neophytes have to contribute grain which , before every ceremony , is measured out by the joking partners to see if there is enough to carry out the performance and effect its transformation into the proper quantities of porridge and beer . See the malted grain that has turned to beer , see the guinea-corn that has turned to porridge , see the leaves that have turned to soup.22 During the ceremonies the neophytes walk round the settlement begging grain and later chickens . The owner of the house where the Bagre is being performed has to send to the market to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and told the neophytes they should go down and buy the salt for three times twenty ( cowries ) , and buy all that ( fresh ) meat for three times twenty cowries , those pumpkin seeds for three times twenty cowries . And they should hurry round and speak to the second-graders and leave out the first-graders . If they hear a noise , 80 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja these are the hawks , they will come . " And the owner 's reputation depends upon seeing that enough beer is available for those who attend , most of whom will contribute in some way to the expenses . As with many such societies , it is the contributions of the families of new entrants that helps to promote the enjoyment of the existing members . The meal is ordinary in respect of its contents but not in respect of its procedures . In the first place the neophytes are fed ( rather than feeding themselves ) like little children ; in the second place the meal , like other ritual meals , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed . If they have not been , then the food in one 's belly could have harmful effects . One has eaten without confessing , for the very fact of accepting the food is a denial of having done wrong . This method of feeding the neophytes , described by the verb to , is not unique to the Bagre , for it occurs in other rites de passage when somebody is being tested ; for example , at a man 's funeral ceremonies , the possible complicity of the widow in his death is tested by lustration and by feeding ( Goody 1962 : 242ff . ) . The procedure consists of offering the neophyte the food to reject , three times for a boy , four for a girl , the food being thrown upon the ground by the one who offers it . On the next occasion , the food is accepted , but before it is eaten it is passed under the arms and legs before being placed in the mouth . After the neophytes have been ritually fed , the various grades of initiates get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recitation of the Bagre the junior members ( the White initiates , Bag pia ) are known as vultures ' ( dab , ' nibe ) because of the way they attack their food , rushing to the Bagre house whenever they are called , thinking it was about food ' but finding when they arrived that there was work to be done as well . In any case the communal feeding and drinking is done in a formal manner , the first portions being offered to the senior members ( the Black initiates , Bag s ) xla ) before the juniors can eat . For these large meals , cooking is done at outside kitchens especially prepared for the occasion where women members ( though they can never join the senior rank ) cook for the men to eat , since here , as in the domestic setting , men and women eat ( though not drink ) separately . Before considering the constitution of units of consumption in the domestic setting , let me return to the matter of fasting and feasting , taboo and injunction ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periodic prohibitions that surround ritual activity , there is an important set of taboos attached to particular groups , clans , statuses , individuals and shrines . In Gonja the most marked of these is 81 Cooking , cuisine and class the universal Muslim prohibition against the eating of pork and the drinking of alcohol . Abstinence from alcohol is justified by Gonja Muslims on the grounds that drink may make one forget the hours of prayer , although only the very strictest observe the rigid requirements of formal Islam . The rationale for the prohibition on pork , however , has been assimilated to other local justifications for observing similar prohibitions , that the animal in question helped an ancestor ( in this case Mohammed ) in a difficult situation , the same reason that is given for the curious ceremony called the Beating of the Guinea Fowl . In other cases no such rationale is provided , as with the ruling estate 's refusal to eat monkey ( lakasa ) . Just as it is the mark ' of a Muslim not to eat pork , so too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LoDagaa that they observe a particular prohibition . Among the Naayile , the squirrel is the dume or protector of the clan because of the role that it played in saving the clan 's founding ancestor from certain death . But not all clans have prohibitions relating to wild animals ; some have food prohibitions of a different kind . Among the Kpiele , the inhabitants of Chaa , a ban is placed on pie puo Saab , on eating porridge from a bowl placed in a basket . It should be insisted that these food avoidances , though very widespread , are only part of a wider set of prohibitions on human behaviour ; for the Haiyuri clan , who have a tradition of migration from the Mossi Kingdom where much cloth was woven , have a prohibition against throwing a roll of cloth from one to the other . In many cases people do not even bother to give any rationale for these prohibitions , although if pressed they may sometimes refer vaguely to their forefathers . Essentially they serve as markers of membership , and it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which they form a highly structured part . This is not to deny they are strongly internalised , having been taught at the earliest age . But their significance lies in placing a boundary on social action beyond which members of this particular group can not go , knowing quite well that others can . The same range of prohibitions that apply to groups also apply to shrines which individuals have inherited or acquired , and to associations ( such as the Bagre ) which they have joined voluntarily or involuntarily . Each individual has a particular constellation of prohibitions ( chiru ) , some of which are lifelong , whereas others , no less significant , have been acquired as the result of consulting a particular shrine . Still others may be completely individual , as when Zuko was forbidden in a dream by his beings of the wild to drink beer , a prohibition which only confirmed this eminent diviner in his solitary habits . There is of course no absolute distinction between individual and 82 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja group prohibitions on food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. prohibition , for whatever reason , then his wife has to adapt her cooking accordingly if he is going to comply . So too the children will probably be confined to the same foods , implicitly observing the same taboo . In other cases where the whole family is seen to have benefited from the help of a particular shrine , an individual prohibition will be converted into a continuing family one . Every new shrine that one consults , or wishes to establish in or near one 's compound , involves some change of behaviour . Certain actions are prohibited , others are enjoined . Most of these acts have to do with food , if only because the intake of food is so often related to the problems of health ; and it is for such reasons that one usually sets out to establish a new shrine . That shrine will have it own medicines ' ( tii ) , its own tree-roots ( daanyigr ) to make the powders to eat , the tisanes to drink or an infusion to wash in . In addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are often dietary . These practices are seen as having a specific beneficial effect ; at the same time they mark off attendance at a shrine or membership of a congregation in an unambiguous way , a way that is concerned with that core activity of mankind , the consumption of food , the internalisation of material objects necessary for the health of body and mind . In these circumstances , it is not surprising that so many taboos ' centre around food . Few of the persisting prohibitions , however , touch upon central foods or central practices . Eating food in a basket ' is fairly easy to avoid ; so is the throwing of reels of cloth , for the LoDagaa do not weave . Likewise the animals are those that one is likely to need only in times of hunger , or possibly of starvation ; in times of sufficiency the prohibition would present no problem . There is of course a great difference between hunger and starvation . As a prisoner of war , one experienced hunger for weeks at a time . Rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several months , did one feel anything else , given the limited rations available . For most of the time , food was never far from one 's thoughts , either awake or asleep . Individuals tried to recollect meals that they had enjoyed , making half-imagined , half-recollected Michelin guides to the best restaurants they had visited . Joking references to Freud confirmed the dominance of culinary over sexual deprivation , in dreams as well as in day-dreams . But this deprivation was very different from starvation , although at one stage some Indian colleagues did approach this point since they were not prepared to eat the tins of pressed beef provided by our captors , who were possibly ignorant of their prohibitions . The attitude of the Hindu towards the flesh of the cow differs significantly from that of the Muslim towards pork . For the Koran declares : But unto 83 Cooking , cuisine and class him who shall be compelled by necessity to eat of these things , not lusting , nor wilfully transgressing , God will surely be graceful and merciful ' ( The Bee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that brought home the strength of food taboos embodied in the Hindu religion . But there was another incident , just as marked , in which the strength of the avoidance owed nothing to a specific religion . We were some dozen occupants in the room allocated to us in the camp , some old friends , others of recent acquaintance . Cooking was done in common ; receipts from our captors , Red Cross parcels , food acquired in other ways , all was pooled , with the one exception of chocolate which sometimes arrived in private packages . Two people cooked for one month at a time and were responsible for the rations , for collecting fuel , for all the duties of preparation , serving and clearing up . People ate exclusively in the units to which they had attached themselves ; not all groups were as large as this and some individuals organised their own food . The spread of household size lay between one and twelve , with the average toward the lower end . Rarely did one ever consume food outside one 's chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplies that had been saved up , and occasionally one was invited elsewhere . With a friend I was asked to take a meal with someone we had known in a different camp . A stew was offered us , which was plentiful and excellent . We understood the contents had been obtained from the guards in exchange for cigarettes ; presumably one of our captors had done a little trading for a rabbit he had shot . On finishing the meal , however , our host told us that we had just eaten not rabbit but cat . The realisation that we had committed an act of quasi-cannibalism was followed not by contriteness but by congratulations ; we had broken an unstated taboo and discovered a new source of food . On returning to our own room , we proposed to our companions that we find a cat for Christmas . The suggestion was met with implacable opposition . No one would share in our guilt , however tasty . Anxious to exploit our new-found freedom , we proposed to cook such a meal just for ourselves , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the cooks of the month , that would not do ; there was no question of using the communal vessels for such a purpose . I recount this story partly to make the point that prohibitions of this kind can be as strong when God is not involved as when he is . Those who hold with the kingship of custom , the domination of culture , will have no difficulty in accounting for the persistence of such taboos ' under conditions of hardship . I would add that their strength seems to rest on the fact that they are concerned with a process that , unlike many others , has dominated our lives from the beginning ; the prohibitions , avoidances , taboos , have been acquired ( rather than inculcated ) in our 84 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja infancy , and have become part of our continued interaction with and perception of the animals concerned . But for most of us , such prohibitions have their limits and given tough enough conditions , as we know from the experiences of those confined under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannibalism becomes a mode of survival . Conrad 's Marlow in Heart of Darkness was not alone in his crime , and in those extreme circumstances the world is perhaps more forgiving than the individual himself . UNITS OF CONSUMPTION There are two basic patterns of eating , deriving from the division of the consumption unit by sex and by age . Of these two axes the sexual is the most significant . It is necessarily the case that the mother , or rather , a mother , feeds her children of both sexes at the earliest age when they are dependent upon the breast . It is not necessarily the mother since the institution of wet-nurses was widespread in Western European cultures until recently . St Augustine complained to Pope Gregory of the Anglo-Saxons ' behaviour in this regard , attributing the practice to sexual incontinence ( Bede , I , 27 ) . In the seventeenth century it was found among well-to-do families such as the Verneys ; Mary Verney put her son out to a village foster-mother a few weeks after he was born ( Verney 1925 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century George Moore made the abuse of the wet-nurse the central theme of his novel , Esther Waters . The poor had to share their milk with the children of the rich so as to preserve the features , figures and freedom of their mothers ; indeed the whole system of the nursery placed upbringing in the hands of the wet-nurse , the nanny and the governess , those mother-surrogates for the upper classes . It was a system that virtually vanished with the disappearance of servants , the coming of the industrial cuisine to the nursery in the shape of feeding bottle , packaged milk and tinned baby-foods , not to speak of the influence of democratic sentiments , increasingly insistent since the introduction of universal suffrage and universal education . But England was not the only locus of this practice , which was widespread in Mediterranean lands . Everywhere it implied a hierarchically stratified society , where differential access to resources and styles of life could be exploited to provide different feeding facilities for the children of rich and poor . There is evidence for the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may reflect the relation between town and country as much as that between burgher and peasant . ' In Africa , co-wives may at times feed each other 's children during the long period they are normally at the breast ( Fortes 1949a : 130 ) . And later 85 Cooking , cuisine and class on many societies in West Africa send children to be fostered by kin ( E. Goody 1981 ) . But in the early phases children are normally fed by their mothers , forming matrifocal segments of a larger unit of consumption to which they will later contribute as producers . It is the question of what happens after weaning that is of interest . In both the African societies with which I am primarily concerned , boys and girls grow up eating with the mother until the boys eventually join an eating group consisting either of other young men in the house or else of their father and the other senior males . But adult men and women virtually never eat together . The woman brings the bowl of porridge and another of relish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern is widespread in Africa and has nothing to do with the entertainment of strangers , as in some other parts of the world where women are in seclusion . And it is a pattern that is very persistent . Even in the rapidly changing sectors of society it is rare to see husband and wife eat together in a local eating house . Even in professional families the husband or other men are sometimes served alone , while the wife and other women retire to the kitchen . In the traditional LoDagaa society the women will take their share with the children in the cooking area , while the men will be served on the rooftop , sometimes in a shade hut , sometimes in the open . They eat separately and they eat differently . For while the men squat or sit on three-legged stools , the women sit with legs outstretched or on four-legged stools . Visiting a friend working in Morocco who was much concerned with the low status of women , I was impressed with the way that the women in Berber families sat down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join in the conversation . In Africa the separation that has been noted as far as property is concerned , men inheriting from men , women from women ( Bosman 1705 ; Goody 1976 ) , has its parallel on the more general level of male ? female relations . For example , there is less social intercourse between the sexes , more separation into single-sex groups , at work , in eating , at play , than I have observed in India , Europe or the Middle East.25 This matter is not easy to assess , given that it is based on impressions rather than quantifiable observations , and given that there is no consistent tie-up , even within classes , and certainly not within cultures ' . In Gujerat , I have dined with the men among the poor and with men and women among the rich . Nevertheless the closer social relations of men with women , and specifically with their wives ( though sometimes with their sisters ) appears as a constant theme in the earliest Middle Eastern and Indian art , an art that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower strata . Units of consumption do at times exceed the size of units of 86 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja production in a number of communal types of housekeeping . We need to distinguish here between the large-scale preparation of food and communal eating . For example , in a monastic community , food is prepared in a common kitchen and eaten in a communal dining hall , the long tables of which indicate the communal nature of the meal . Alternatively a common kitchen may prepare separate meals , as in a restaurant , meals that may be the same for each constituent unit ( as when en pension or en famille ) or which may be chosen a la carte in more expensive establishments . But in simpler societies , food may be prepared separately by individual households and then brought together for common consumption . Among the LoDagaa this is often the case with the beer brewed for festivals , since no individual household would have the capacity to cater for everybody . On the other hand , the cooking of the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in a series of ordinary containers as at the Bagre festival of the LoDagaa or in a special pot of immense size as for the Great Porridge ( kude gbung ) of the Damba ceremony in Gonja . However even at ordinary times there may be an element of communal consumption when the food one eats comes from different kitchens . The most notable instance occurs in Gonja , where , as Esther Goody described in her study ( 1973 ) , little girls may be seen during the evening hours balancing dishes of food on their heads and walking from one side of the village to the other . This situation is typical of Gbuipe , the division closest both geographically and socially to Ashanti , where one also finds reports of the same practice ( Fortes 1949b : 63-4 ) . In Ashanti a newly married woman may remain in her natal home after marriage , cooking for her husband in the evenings , sending along his food by a small girl and visiting his room later that night . In Gonja the situation is somewhat different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both spouses retain strong ties with their natal kin which take the form of sharing part of the meal with absent kinsfolk . In other words , the regular unit of consumption is not bounded here , as in many other societies , by the walls of the dwelling itself , the house or apartment ; the houseful is not necessarily the household , nor is the latter always contained within the former ; the unit of consumption is different from the one that eats together ( the eating group ) . The instance recounted above is not an example of communal eating , but rather of one man or woman consuming cooked food from different sources in the course of one meal . When men live in polygynous households , they often consume food from different kitchens , albeit all within the same household , in the course of successive meals . An essential feature of African polygyny is that each wife has her separate 87 Cooking , cuisine and class room which must be built for her soon after she joins her husband . The only instance of multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in southern Gonja that were constructed at the time of the flooding of the Volta valley to create the Akosombo dam . This immense project involved the building of new housing consisting of small core ' houses made out of concrete to which the occupants were invited to add extra rooms but only in the original materials . This attempt to prevent degradation ' was fortunately abandoned after some years . For while a man had no difficulty in adding to a house built in the traditional fashion since the materials came from the immediate neighbourhood , the labour from kith and kin and the skill from his ancestors , the introduction of new imported materials required not only a cash outlay but also quite different techniques . No longer could one 's mates provide the help ; it was a question of employing a mason to make the concrete blocks and to construct the building . So additional rooms did not always get built for new wives who sometimes had to share a single room in conditions of rural squalor out of keeping with the obvious newness of their dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special situations of this kind , which may include temporary accommodation in town , polygynously married wives sleep and usually cook separately , certainly when they have children of their own . But wives do not usually undertake cooking for their husband at the same time , for the process is long and arduous , involves fetching firewood and water , grinding grain that is often very hard , and stirring the porridge over a hot and smoky fire . They take it in turns , just as their husband takes turns at sleeping on their mats ; the cook is also the sexual partner . Among the LoDagaa , with their six-day market week ' , it is generally a question of three days on and three days off , a longer cycle if there are more than two wives . The wife who cooks will also provide food for her co-wife . But it is sometimes the case that even if the wives of two brothers , or of a man and his son , do not form one cooking unit ( unit of preparation ) , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by their respective wives . In my experience this is more often the case with young men in a dwelling unit , which can get very large among the LoDagaa , than it is among their seniors whose relations are often coloured by years of quarrels over property , women , seniority and so forth ? one aspect of the solidarity of siblings ' who have lived together over a whole lifetime . Such limited commensalism does occur outside the household ' but in most cases eating together is limited to those males who continue to farm as one unit and to store their food in one granary . LoDagaa ideology ' is often phrased in more cooperative terms . Members of a local lineage , consisting perhaps of one hundred persons , 88 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja that is , of some twenty-five adult males , can be heard to speak of themselves as having one hoe ' , i.e. as farming together . It is true that kinsmen sometimes cooperate in certain farming tasks , such as the clearing of new land , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On these occasions a man will arrange for his wife to brew beer and make food , and then call upon his friends and kinsfolk to come and aid him . But such an appeal is certainly not confined to his agnatic kin , members of the same lineage . Particularly among the LoDagaba ( one of the two groups ' I speak of as the LoDagaa ) , it is a man 's sister 's sons who are the first to be called , and almost certainly the first to signal their intention of coming . And one of the main sources of labour is one 's sons-in-law , prospective and actual , who will call their kin and their kith to come along and farm ( diem kob ) . Nowadays , with some prospective sons-in-law acquiring an education , and hence a salary rather than the ability to farm , such parties may be commuted to cash , unless one can prevail upon one 's brothers to undertake the work alone , but as we have seen , such unreciprocated work is not a long-term proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more than a description of the obligations of affinal farming ; it is an expression of the closeness of lineage members to one another . Indeed the phrase is taken by some to recall an earlier state of affairs , before the external world bore so heavily upon them , before men engaged in so many petty quarrels and split up into smaller farming groups . But there is no evidence that at an earlier period units of production were larger than they are today . To have one hoe ' is a metaphor for lineage solidarity , in the productive field , expressing the joint obligation of a lineage , for example , to contribute to a sacrifice to the local Earth shrine , though it should be said that in practice such obligations rarely emerge undamaged by incipient fission and actual tension . The equivalent expression heard among the Vagella inhabitants of the Gonja town of Bole is having one bowl ' . The Vagella are one of the groups of commoners who inhabited the area before the Gonja arrived . They claim to be immigrants from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a role to unilineal descent groups ( as do the other acephalous peoples of the region , including those from whom they claim to have branched off ) than the ruling estate among the Gonja who are more typical of the inhabitants of the savannah states in this respect . The phrase having one bowl ' relates to consumption rather than to production , but it has a similar significance to the LoDagaa phrase . The Vagella occupy certain wards of the town of Bole , where a large number of compounds are grouped together under one very large flat roof ; it is as if the already large compounds of the LoDagaa ( with an average of 16.3 Cooking , cuisine and class in the 1960 Census ) had never split apart physically , even though the same kind of internal fission of households had taken place . So the residential arrangements did lend some credence to the interpretation of the statement as referring to a past practice of eating together . Indeed people asserted that even today the senior men of the ward would get together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cooked by their several wives and produced in their separate fields . So convincing were these statements that I spent several nights in a room in the Vagella section ( our normal abode was on the other side of the town ) trying to observe this particular get-together . I never caught any glimpse of a commensal meal.26 In other parts of Gonja , however , the unit of consumption ( the group that eats together ) does turn out to be systematically larger than the unit of production and the unit of preparation . Esther Goody describes the situation in the town of Gbuipe in central Gonja where the compounds have a mean of some twenty residents , that is , from two to three households . Food preparation is based on the conjugal family , but each cook will send a bowl of food to the head of the compound , which corresponds to a farm-clearing group . While senior men eat alone , others will consume together the food sent by the wives of each ( E. Goody 1973 : 54 ) . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not dealing with lineages or with a lineage-based society ; the groups of men involved are relatively small and the cooking is done within the conjugal family . The point concerning the size of extended commensal groups is of some theoretical interest in view of attempts to incorporate such an idea in the formulation of a paradigmatic lineage mode of production ' . In the pioneering work of Claude Meillassoux on the Gouro of the Ivory Coast , the author offers a reconstruction of their social system at the beginning of the century , before the impact of cash crop production on the economy . This reconstruction involves taking at face value the retrospective claim of the Gouro to have farmed ( eaten ) together as a lineage at an earlier period . Discussions of this kind are always difficult to assess when we do not know either the size or order of segmentation of the lineage.27 But we also have to consider the way that such phrases are used at present , partly metaphorically , partly with a glance backwards towards a more solidary but non-existent past . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a number of instances from various parts of the world ( Goody 1972b ) showed that the average size of such groups was relatively small , though the sample obviously did not include latifundia , monastic estates , feudal domains , slave holdings , haciendas or collective farms . The largest figures I obtained were in fact from the LoDagaa themselves , where the average size was 11.1 ( for the 90 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja LoWiili ) . While the cross-cultural evidence on commensal groups does indicate that we may expect larger units where we find men 's houses ( for example , in certain societies in New Guinea and South America as well as among the Swat Pathans ) , the evidence for simple agricultural societies in Africa is that such groups were generally little larger , on the average , than the productive units . But just as there were times when people farmed in larger groups , so there were occasions in which larger numbers cooked or ate together . In Gonja the main such occasion was the annual Damba festival to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Islamic year is celebrated by the killing of sheep ( Dongi , al-'Id al-kabfr ) , though this festival is carried out on a family rather than a community level . But at most rites of passage in the human cycle and especially at funerals , large quantities of food were prepared for those attending . The main community festival is a combination of political and religious aspects . Damba , like the Gdne festival of northern Nigeria , is held upon the Prophet 's birthday ( or day of circumcision ) , but it is also a political festival , celebrating the dominance of the ruling estate . The ceremony takes three days , the names for which centre around the preparation of food : the Sorting of the Rice , the Killing of the Cow , and the Great Porridge . On the first day the members of the different estates gather in front of the house of the divisional chief while the Muslims pick the stones from the rice that is supposedly going to be used for the common meal . They sit around in a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recite prayers . After this the members of the ruling estate perform a series of dances in front of their chief . On the second day a cow donated by the divisional chief is killed in the middle of his courtyard , following a series of prayers and processions round the beast . It is this meat that is eaten on the last day , the Day of the Great Porridge . Early that morning the rice is cooked and distributed . Later on , the women in the chief 's house cook porridge made from guinea-corn and cassava in huge pots and portion it out in a series of small bowls which are prepared for every group that is present . At the same time the Spokesman or Linguist ( dogte or nsauwura ) for the division holds up portions of the meat and calls for representatives of the various sub-divisions to step forward and take their share . Not only does he call out the names of the various social divisions but also those of certain specialist occupations and other roles , including witches ' , thieves ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal , even the anti-social elements . The whole community partakes willy nilly in the connnensality . It is a joint meal with clear political overtones , or rather a mixture of political and communal components , since participation reinforces the position of the ruling estate , in the general manner of the 91 Cooking , cuisine and class street parties that enliven the streets of Britain at the installation or jubilee of a monarch . There is one other aspect of this meal that requires some comment . Although it is a festival , it is not a feast ; there is no Grande Bouffe , no extravagant blow-out , no meal of many courses . The actual content of the meal is that of everyday life . For some there may be more meat , but it is at most a question of more rather than different . In these communities there is no special menu for festive occasions , though clearly some dishes are preferred to others ; indeed there is a minimal differentiation , not only between festival and weekday , but between the various estates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs is the position of rice . For although the preliminary preparation of the meal centres on the sorting of rice , this cereal plays little part in the meal itself . It is an indication of the northern origin and Muslim affiliations of the ruling estate ; in the pagan context of gbandau they eat yams , a local food with southern links ; while for ordinary ceremonies it is porridge that forms the basic diet . In fact the Gonja , like other peoples in northern Ghana , neither grow nor eat much rice . Both these conditions are changing quite rapidly . Rice is becoming a common element in the diet of the middle class , and indeed Uncle Ben 's American rice forms one of the country 's food imports , though it is still not a favourite food in the north . However a great deal of rice is beginning to be grown there , starting in 1969 when the mechanised cultivation of high-yielding varieties began in earnest , leading to some revolutionary changes in the holding and distribution of land . However , west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rice has long been produced and consumed as the most important cereal . Whereas many of the present staple crops such as maize and cassava were brought in from other continents , one variety of rice ( oryza glaberrima ) was a domesticate of West Africa with a long history of cultivation . It was from the north-west , the ancient rice growing area , that the ruling estate of Gonja claim to have come , and it is a claim one has no reason to doubt despite the fact that they have changed both their language and their diet in tune with local demands . However , for the purposes of the ceremony rice has to be acquired and cleansed . While it does not have the same symbolic significance , similar factors lie behind the continued use of wine in the rituals of Christians and Jews even in those areas of northern Europe where the grape can not be grown and had little local significance . In. northern Ghana , too , I have attended a Catholic Mass where both the bread and the wine have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made possible by the advent of Israeli wine and unleavened bread ( mazzot ) in the diplomatic bag . The explicit connection of the bread and the wine with the body and 92 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja blood of Christ clearly encouraged the continued use of these agricultural products when Christianity moved outside its place of origin and their centre of cultivation . As Duby ( 1974 ) has pointed out , religion , and the desire to imitate Roman models , encouraged these cultigens to spread outside their home areas into regions for which they were little suited at the time . There is little explicit symbolism in the use of rice , except in a general sense to reinforce the ideology of the ruling estate as a group of conquering warriors coming from afar , and linked to the great states of the Niger Bend . The conservation of this feature of the Damba ceremony is part of the intrinsic conservatism of ritual ' , whose formality ensures the continuation of what might otherwise have fallen into desuetude . Ritual can be said to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own sake . For the Gonja , large communal meals play a more important part in social life than for the LoDagaa , with the exception of the Bagre ceremony itself . At funerals , too , porridge will be cooked and served to the multitude attending ; indeed the actual preparation of the food is once again an important part of the ceremony where women 's roles come very much to the fore , leading to a similar distribution of food and meat . Since the state of Gonja includes an important Muslim component , and since the ruling estate themselves acknowledge their links with Islam as well as with the local religious practices , the brewing and drinking of beer , so significant among the LoDagaa , plays little importance in such ceremonies . The sharing of food has a somewhat equivalent role to the sharing of drink at the funerals and other ceremonies of the LoDagaa . But this phenomenon is not only linked with the substitution of porridge for beer ( they are after all only alternative ways of treating the same grain ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages where food sharing is common , rather than the dispersed settlements of the LoDagaa . The increased stress on the communal collecting , cooking and consumption of cooked food among the Gonja is also linked with the existence of a centralised regime . It is an aspect of what Polanyi called redistribution ' , and of what Pryor ( 1977 ) calls centric transfer ' ; and it is characteristic of a regime where , despite political and religious divisions , and the existence of a form of stratification , there is no great difference in what Max Weber termed styles of life ' . All members of the state eat together , just as they sleep together ; they interdine , just as they intermarry ; kinship ties and the distribution of food cut across estate membership . Indeed the interchange of food and sex are aspects of the fact that domestic life is not separated into groups exclusively or even largely composed of members of the same caste or class . This fact is critical to the relation between cuisine and hierarchy that we develop in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have discussed market activity in relation to the supply of the raw materials for the kitchen , today there is also a vigorous sale of cooked food . In principle there is nothing new about this trade . Women have traditionally prepared not only beer , an important form of cooked food , but also special dishes such as fried bean cakes , which would normally be available only at markets . This was the case in pre-colonial days , and today the smoky section selling cooked food is a prominent feature of every market , though it is men who sell cooked meat . In the larger towns , such as Salaga , the weekly markets were supplemented by daily ones at which cooked food as well as raw produce was continually available . In Salaga , according to Binger ( 1892 ) , the market began at seven o'clock when women brought their akoko ( gruel ) or to ( porridge ) . While young girls sold kola and cooked meat , others brought pots with boiled yams , to which salt and pepper had been added . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season when the town had few merchants , two or three cattle were killed and the meat chopped up for sale in hundred cowrie lots . Moreover , surrounding the market-place were houses dedicated to trade , where landlords provided the housing and similar services needed by traders and other travellers . While not yet shops , they were already stores . The coming of colonial rule brought with it the shop . The establishment of Government shops at Gambaga and Wa was followed by private enterprise in the shape of larger expatriate firms such as United Africa Company as well as smaller traders , mainly of Yoruba or southern Ghanaian origin . It was these latter traders who visited the smaller villages around on their market days and who also undertook some peddling at other times , especially in imported manufactured goods . Nowadays such activity is more common in Gonja than it is among the LoDagaa , whose system of local markets is more developed . Possibly because of the greater distances between villages , weekly markets were rare in Gonja ( E. Goody 1973 : 18-19 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ruling estate , men as well as women , may be found carrying their wares around the outlying villages . But while cloth and imported goods are often sold in this way , with the exception of salt , food products play little or no part in this trade . However , a mini-market in cooked food develops at many ceremonies and rites of passages , especially at LoDagaa funerals where men and women come from afar and spend the best part of the day sitting , participating and paying their respects . Women will bring their cooking pots , set up three stones as a hearth , light a fire and make food for sale . Nowadays this is done in all permanent markets and in most villages and towns where passing truck drivers , full-time employees or local ( 4 Production and consumption among the LoDagaa and Gonja schoolboys create a demand for ready-made food . It is the counterpart of the permanent beer-bar , both being developments of traditional institutions where food and drink were prepared for sale . It is as well to remind ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ceremony but always had a market ' element which expanded under impact with wider systems of market exchange and division of labour . To summarise the problems of difference in food and the cuisine among the LoDagaa and Gonja , I referred first to the direct influence of environmental factors , the LoDagaa being situated to the north , leading to a greater concentration on cereals as against root crops . Though rainfall was slightly less , they had better sources for drinking water ; since they had fewer tsetse , they could support more livestock . The Gonja did import horses for military purposes and for prestige but they could not breed them , whereas the LoDagaa bred cattle and smaller livestock , but had no use for the horse . From one point of view it appears paradoxical that the Gonja , organised in a state system with market towns and greater craft specialisation , depended to a greater extent on wild animals and other natural resources . Ecologically their land was poorer , not only in soil but in dry season water . It was also much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fact has perplexed some scholars who , taking their model of the state from the Middle East , have seen political centralisation as linked to the increased surplus gained in agricultural production and hence in higher densities ( Goody 1978 ) . It is critical to my argument about cooking to point out that African states were not like this . Their agriculture was probably less productive than that of most tribal peoples and certainly of some hill areas where a form of intensive cultivation was practised . Simple forms of irrigation were more common among the LoDagaa than the Gonja . The latter lived partly by booty , raiding the resources of their stateless neighbours for slaves , for cattle and anything else they could take away . The gains from their raids meant that the warrior rulers themselves could undertake less agriculture , a task on which they tended to look down . Their activity created devastated areas , driving the tribal peoples into denser settlements and finding the emptier areas easier to conquer . As a result they had more open land for communal ' exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' peoples in northern Ghana occupied what were in some ways better lands on which they clustered together at higher densities , partly in refuge , partly as a means of defence , partly because the lands were often more fertile . The heavier densities and better land of the l.ol ) agaa meant farms around the compounds and cattle in the bush . 95 Cooking , cuisine and class In Gonja it was just the opposite , with most food being stored away from the village . Thus the state 's dependence on gathering ( including the gathering of humans ) was greater than that of the tribe . In Gonja , there was more wild meat and less slaughtered livestock . Not only was there more empty space but the Gonja were better able to exploit it with horses , some guns and a tradition of war and the chase . Wild vegetable produce , including shea nuts , was more readily available . So too was honey , essentially a product of the wild . In the sphere of drink , the Gonj a tapped palm wine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic product of domesticated crops , beer . Beer was always offered at LoDagaa festivals , to visitors as well as to the gods . Otherwise the food exchanged was raw rather than cooked , except at the series of Bagre festivals . Whereas among the Gonja , both national festivals ( the equivalent of the LoDagaa religious rites ) and family ceremonies were marked by the preparing and distribution of cooked food . Porridge was partly a non-alcoholic equivalent of beer in a Muslim society . But communal cooking was also related to the existence of nucleated villages rather than the dispersed settlements of the LoDagaa , to aspects of centralised organisation which contrasted with the ordered anarchy ' of their neighbours . The differences in social organisation affected the course of events in the colonial and post-colonial worlds , and these in turn the nature of production and consumption . Their dependence on slaves , on booty production and on a warrior ( or chiefly ) tradition meant that the coming of colonial rule hit the Gonja much harder than the LoDagaa . The state had everything to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new political openings offered by Independence . For the LoDagaa opportunities opened up all around . Not only were they more ready to accept education as a way of advancement , but their agricultural produce was in increasing demand . High population densities left little room for increases in production . But like the Konkomba in the east , some of them moved into the underpopulated lands of Gonja to grow the yams and other crops required by the south , entering early on into commercial farming . At the same time some of the inhabitants of the Gonja towns , who had always been busy in the market , entered into the commercial exchange of livestock on a much greater scale than before in order to supply their own needs and those of urban markets of the south . But despite these various differences that affected food in general , the actual shape of the cuisine in both societies was surprisingly similar . We did not discover any major differentiation of cooking either on a periodic basis , for festivals , or in relation to the different strata of Gonja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the cuisine in the major Eurasian societies , where the differences are of another order . 96 The high and the low : culinary culture in Asia and Europe In the traditional societies of northern Ghana there was little internal difference in the food , whether raw or cooked , of the various members . Even a state like Gonja that consisted of distinct strata organised in a hierarchy and differentiated in terms of access to political office , socio-economic role and religious affiliation , had a simple cuisine . There is little evidence of differentiation in the accounts of pre-colonial travellers or early administrators , and it is significant that visitors of high status , not only Europeans , were often offered food in its raw rather than its cooked state . The provision of food for strangers was usually the responsibility of the local chief or headman . However in urban centres where merchants gathered , the landlord would provide cooked food for his strangers ' . When Binger visited the Gonja town of Salaga in 1888 , he found the compound of his host had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sign of the hospitality that this well-to-do merchant was prepared to offer ( Binger 1892 : ii , 85 ) . The situation is not very different today , although the impact of a new type of stratification that results most immediately from literacy and education and is associated with teaching , administration , military rank and political office , is having its effect , more especially now that new forms of primary production , the tractor cultivation of high-yielding varieties of rice for the market , have made their mark on the savannah area ( Goody 1981 ) . These factors ? the impact of colonial rule , the creation of an independent ' nation , the links with the world economy ? have brought the inhabitants in touch with different types of cuisine , and in particular with the products of the industrialisation of cooking . Into the nature of industrial food and its impact on northern Ghana we will enquire in later chapters , before we try to explain the general state of the African cuisine in contrast to the major societies of Eurasia . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of that Eurasian cuisine . In doing so , I will deal only with a small segment of the processes I have described in the last chapter , that is , with the cuisine itself . Even here I am concerned with one basic point , the characteristics ' ) 7 Cooking , cuisine and class of a truly differentiated cuisine marking a society that is stratified culturally as well as politically . The nature of a cuisine is clearly related to the particular system of producing and distributing food . In discussing the emergence of the Chinese cuisine , which he sees as occuring in the Sung period ( 960 ? 1279 ) , Freeman distinguishes three prerequisites . First , there is the availability of a number of ingredients , some imported , together with a wide variety of recipes ; cuisine does not develop out of the cooking traditions of a single region ' ( 1977 : 144 ) . In China it was an imperial venture , a product of the great capital cities , first of Keifeng in the north , then of Hangchow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adventuresome eaters ' , not simply a palace clientele such as already existed in China , but a broader elite which in this case consisted of the growing body of officials as well as the merchants who supplied not only the products of distant lands and diverse regions ( ' the golden peaches of Samarkand ' , the grapes from the Middle East ) but also the huge quantities of grain and other foods needed to maintain the greatest city in the world ' , the extent of whose markets are described by Marco Polo and pictured in that fascinating scroll , Spring Festival on the River ( Freeman 1977 : 143 ) . Thirdly , there were the attitudes which gave first place to the pleasure of consuming food . A fourth prerequisite was also decisive ' , namely the important developments in agriculture and commerce that occurred during this period . The introduction of new species of Vietnamese rice allowed for some double-cropping and opened up new areas for farming ; the development of a commercial agriculture helped to increase production in the country and consumption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of elite consumption , leading to the inclusion of rice , tea and sugar in the diets of the many as well as the few.l In this chapter , I am concerned with a wider development and one which certainly took place earlier in Chinese history as well as in other cultures . While I speak of the development of a differentiated cuisine , an haute cuisine as compared with a low cuisine , it might be better to refer to a higher and lower cooking in order to avoid some of the more specific implications of the French usage to which Freeman calls attention . In any case I see this differentiation as occurring earlier , and as based upon a system of production and stratification that was not to be found in the Black Africa of pre-colonial times , with certain limited exceptions . It is the absence of this productive system that makes the application of terms like feudalism or Asiatic mode of production quite inappropriate to the social systems of that continent , a fact that profoundly affects their cultures as well . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and Asia , I want to look at the way that cooking is 98 The high and the low differentiated in the latter group of societies . In doing so , I draw attention to the fact that those societies have two characteristics that are ' particularly relevant for my purpose. , . Eixst , . they practise forms of intensive agriculture , harnessing animal energy through the plough or controlling water through irrigation and other means . Secondly , they employ writing for a whole variety of purposes , economic , administrative , literary and practical ' . It is in this last field , the practical ' one , where we find the uses of literacy developed in connection with cooking , and more specifically with diet , where early on we find the elaboration of ideas about food and eating in the context of cosmological and physiological systems . The discussion about man in relation to heaven and earth is part of the background to the specialist production of dietary manuals and cookbooks in the contemporary world . A salient feature of the culinary cultures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchical man . The extreme form of this differentiation is found in the allocation of specific foods to specific roles , offices or classes , swans to royalty in England , honey wine to the nobility of Ethiopia . But there were more complex , more subtle forms of differentiation than these , and to try and distinguish some of the main features of the hierarchical cuisine we should first turn to the Ancient Middle East , the cradle of Bronze Age civilisation ' , where the advent of writing and the elaborateness of graphic and sculptural forms enable us to distinguish the outline of a cooking very different in its social implications from that which existed in Africa . Egypt was not the first culture to acquire writing ; that honour appears to belong to another society based on irrigation and the plough , the Sumerians of Mesopotamia .
