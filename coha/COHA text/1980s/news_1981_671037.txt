Comments by Western diplomats in Hanoi , as well as statements by Foreign Ministry officials , indicate that the Government ' s welcome to four visiting American veterans of the Indochina war represents an initial effort to stir public opinion in the United States. // Hanoi ' s aim , according to diplomats here , seems to be " starting a process " that would alter the Reagan Administration ' s stern resistance to normal relations with Vietnam because of the nation ' s occupation of Cambodia . <> <> Visits by Scientists Planned // " Tell your people we are friends , we are not enemies , " Vietnam ' s Foreign Minister , Nguyen Co Thach , told the veterans in agreeing to accept American doctors and scientists to assess the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange and to work with the Vietnam Veterans of America on the question of Americans missing in action. // Life is bleak in Vietnam today , a situation brought about by political isolation , malnutrition in the countryside and urban centers , inflation believed to run as high as 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged crops , a textbook Marxist five-year plan that began in 1976 and ended in failure , and the damage wrought by the war . The exodus of ethnic Chinese tradesmen and skilled workers has further aggravated the problems. // Beyond this , as a major legacy of the war there remain numerous reeducation camps , where former South Vietnamese officials , military men , intellectuals , lawyers , doctors and businessmen have been placed to be " rehabilitated . " Estimates of the number of people confined range anywhere from 20 , 000 to 200 , 000 ; even an approximate figure can not be determined . <> <> Travel Is Restricted // " The human rights situation in Vietnam is very grave , " said one Western diplomat in Hanoi . He said that the Vietnamese now needed travel permits to take a trip outside their own provinces , that job allocations have split up families , and that freedom of association was banned. // Even in Ho Chi Minh City , formerly Saigon , which retains some of the frenetic tempo of the old " pre-liberation " days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book market and confiscated " unconstructive " works , including children ' s fairy tales , romantic novels , mysteries and histories of the French and American involvement , the diplomat said. // At the moment , food is the major problem . Although Nguyen Lam , chairman of Vietnam ' s State Planning Commission , said the nation would meet its goals this year and produce a record 15 million tons , 600 , 000 tons more than last year , the effect of two typhoons in recent years coupled with the north ' s unsuccessful attempt to impose farm cooperatives and collectivization on the peasants in the south has left the population stricken and hungry. // " My students sit and stare and clutch their stomachs with hunger , " said Nina McCoy , an American who works for a Swedish aid group teaching English to Vietnamese medical students at a hospital in Vong Bi , l00 miles northeast of Hanoi , as well as in the capital . " People are lucky if they have rice and maybe a boiled vegetable twice a day . There ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among children scares me . " <> <> ' I ' m Seeing People Shrink ' // Miss McCoy , who is from Cottage Grove , Ore. , and is a 1967 University of Oregon graduate , has worked in Vietnam since July 1979 , without any difficulty from the Hanoi authorities . " I ' m seeing people shrink before my eyes , " she said . " It ' s unbearable . Whatever food people have they try to give to their kids. " // Food rations in many parts of the country , especially the north , have been cut from an average of 31 pounds a month to 25. 5 pounds , far below the 33 pounds considered the minimum subsistence level necessary before the onset of serious malnutrition . Fish , which used to be plentiful , is now in short supply , partly because fuel is scarce and many boats have sailed away with refugees. // On the free market , chicken costs about $2. 04 a pound , other meat about $1. 30 a pound , and rice about 45 cents a pound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , and one Asian diplomat in Hanoi said that the nation ' s economy reminded him of " Bangladesh on a good day . " <> <> Mistakes in Planning Admitted // Vietnamese officials publicly concede that " mistakes in economic planning " - or rigid adherance to collectivization and nationalization of farms - has jolted food production . One of the reasons for increased food output in recent months is a relaxation of controls that opens the way for some incentives and private enterprise. // It is this delicate balancing between ideology and reality that has made it clear to diplomats in Hanoi that the Government seeks relations with the United States . It seemed clear to the American veterans , who met Vietnamese officials - as well as foreign diplomats - that the Hanoi Government ' s view of the United States was skewed by the antiwar movement during the 1960 ' s . The Vietnamese Government presumably feels that by meeting private groups of American citizens now , such as the veterans , it can build up pressures on the American Government. // The American group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vietnam Veterans of America . His companions were Michael R. Harbert , a former Air Force sergeant ; Thomas A. Bird , a former infantryman , and John F. Terzano , who was a Navy seaman . All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America . <> <> Ties Seemed Near in ' 78 // What Vietnamese Government officials seem not to realize , judging from a journalist ' s conversations with some of them , is that Hanoi hardly has the kind of popular support in the United States that the Government here assumes it has , and that normal relations with Vietnam are not a priority among Americans. // According to several accounts , normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam appeared near at hand in the fall of 1978 and discussions began on establishment of embassies . In Hanoi , the Vietnamese now show American visitors the elegant villa on Hai Ba Trung Street that was to have been the United States Embassy . But the Carter Administration drew back at the last moment because of the impending normalization of relations with China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 1978 , was a Vietnamese-Soviet treaty of cooperation that makes the Hanoi Government firmly reliant on Moscow . Estimates of Soviet aid run from $3 million a day to $6 million a day for military and civilian projects , including most of the upkeep of the 200 , 000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia . There are thought to be 8 , 000 Russians in Vietnam now , and the Soviet Air Force and Navy have acquired repair and refuelling facilities in Da Nang and Cam Ranh Bay . <> <> ' Guest Workers ' Sent Abroad // To repay the huge military and economic assistance , Vietnam has sent approximately 50 , 000 " guest workers " to factories in the Soviet-bloc countries , according to Western diplomats . In effect , the workers are paying off Vietnam ' s debt by receiving only a part of their East European salaries . The rest is set aside for debt servicing. // Vietnam ' s total external debt has climbed to $3 billion , according to official Vietnamese sources . Of this amount , about $1. 6 billion is thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union and Vietnam have already arisen over Soviet influence in Cambodia , and some diplomats here predict that the intensely nationalistic Vietnamese leaders , who fought the French and the Americans , will never fall under the total sway of the Russians. // There are grumbles in Hanoi about the poor quality of some of the corn and rice that the Soviet Union has sent . Beyond this , there are personal complaints . " The Russians make it obvious that they want no contact at all with the Vietnamese , " said one foreign aid worker . " The Vietnamese say privately that the Russians are rude , overbearing people . The Vietnamese laugh at them . Everyone listens to the Voice of America , and everyone knows what ' s going on in Poland , and the Vietnamese are not fooled at all . " <> <> Value of Aid Questioned // Moreover , Asian and Western diplomats in Hanoi say that the Russians are probably already realizing that aid to Vietnam is of questionable value . According to the Far Eastern Economic Review , published in Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that goods sent from the Soviet Union in 1968 were rotting in the Haiphong Harbor docks . The Vietnamese refused a Soviet request that they clean up the goods. // Sweden , the major Western donor of aid , is finding " severe difficulties , " according to one Asian diplomat in Hanoi . Sweden has spent nearly $400 million on a paper mill outside Hanoi that was called " a classic disaster " by the diplomat . " They are building a high-cost , high-technology paper mill , " he said , " and the problems of electricity and water and labor are incredible. " // The problems for this nation of 54 million , which has failed to grow enough or earn enough to feed itself , are compounded by the fact that about half the national wealth is used to support the armed forces . With more than 2. 6 million under arms , Vietnam has the third largest military force in the world after the Soviet Union and China. //                @ @ @ @ @
