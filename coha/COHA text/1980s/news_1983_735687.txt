txt First Boston Inc. recently moved into a skyscraper here built by Fisher Brothers , and it wrote proudly of its new home in the latest annual report . " First Boston 's headquarters , Park Avenue Plaza , symbolizes the firm 's position as a unique global financial Institution , " the text reads . " Its location , New York City 's Park Avenue , is corporate headquarters for more than 200 domestic and international financial institutions . " On the annual report 's cover is a photo of the upper part of the glass tower , of which First Boston has 10 stories . Not shown , however , Is the street-level part of the tower . A view of that would reveal something else  --  a five  --  story building separating the tower from Park Avenue . " Park Avenue Plaza " actually Is at 55 E. 52nd St. , more than 100 feet from Park Avenue . " It was a very creative thing to have done and actually pulled off . " remarks a First Boston managing director , William Mayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One real-estate consultant , James Austrian of the firm of Jones Lang Wootton , estimates that ' ' all other things being equal , a Park Avenue address can mean up to 20% higher rents . " At the avenue 's current rents , that would mean an extra $5 to $8 per year per square foot for the landlord . The building has a million square feet . Slick Packaging Although figures like this are n't usually involved , the name game is an old one . Just inside affluent Princeton , N.J. , stands a cluster of about 15 mailboxes . The people who get the mail there live In the old Industrial city of Trenton , but it does n't sound that way if you address a letter to them . In fact , Dow Jones &; Co. , which owns this newspaper , has a Princeton post office box for a printing plant and some corporate offices In nearby South Brunswick Township , N.J. The Princeton post-office box was chosen around 1964 , says Gilbert Faulk , vice president , legal , of Dow Jones , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for at the time , and because Princeton 's location is better known than South Brunswick 's . It was more for Identification parposes than prestige . Mr. Faulk says . Los Angeles is n't a bad  --  sounding place to say you 're from , but Beverly Bills sounds better ? at least when It conies to pricing your home . About 2,500 Los Angeles homes Just north of Beverly Hills use Beverly Hills addresses  --  adding , by one real-estate bro ? kers estimate , 10% to 15% to their value . And here on Park Avenue ... or the Park Avenue area ... the building that First Boston Inhabits has a neighbor known as 237 Park Ave . For years , this building stood at 466 Lexington Ave. , a considerably less exalted location , Needless to say , the office building 's owner , Olympia &; York Developments Ltd. , did n't magically move It . But this Is not to say that no magic was involved . Some of the legerdemain was performed by the landlord and sonic by the borough president of Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on LexIngton Avenue , as Its old address Indicates . An alley divides It from a building straddling Park Avenue , 230 Park . The developer recently reconstructed its building and , in doing so . repaved the alley and strung a canopy across to 230 Park  --  paying that building 's owner $500,000 for the privilege . The repaved alley and the canopy impressed Borough President Stein , His office long has had wide discretion over building permits , special names , addresses and the like in Manhattan , And while the Olympia &; York building was obviously still where it was before , on Lexington between 45th and 46th , Mr. Stein ruled that henceforth it could use the address 237 Park . Mr. Stein 's spokesman , Robert Minter , explains that the building " seems to be part of the Park Avenue collection of buildings which are not on Park Avenue . " An Olympia &; York vice president , Edward Minskoff , concedes that the building is " offset " from Park Avenue but calls that a " technicality . " Like many real-estate developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Borough President Stein , giving $10,000 . ( Fisher Brothers , which declined to discuss its success in winning the " Park Avenue Plaza " address , gave $20,000.1 But such contributions have no effect on his thinking . Mr. Stein says . What he does consider , Mr. Stein says , are the city 's problems with economic devel ? opment , the obstacles faced by those willing to invest in New York . " There are n't many things you can do to help businesses , so when you can , you do , " says the borough president  --  who , as it happens , once put through a name change for himself . He used to be called Finkelstein . The Postal Service does n't always cooperate , however . It wo n't deliver mall to " Cl. ticorp Center , " for Instance , unless the street address ( 153 East 53rd St. ) is in. eluded . " Park Avenue Plaza " faced such a problem at first ; the post office would n't bring over letters unless they said " 55 East 52nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting a special ZIP code Just for the building . That meant trying to convince the Postal Service that the building 's mall vol. ume would be large , and occupants such as First Boston were asked to help by estimat ' Mg the amount of mail they would receive . With its address riding on the outcome , First Boston took this task seriously , putting several employees to work projecting the Impressive volume of mall It would receive . " The whole process was in some sense a Illtie humorous , " Mr. Mayer says . It worked , though . " Park Avenue Plaza " got Its own ZIP code , and now letter writers do n't have to say what street the building is on . ZIP codes , however , do n't solve any problems for people trying to go to one of these buildings . St. Regis Paper Co . Is among the companies headquartered at " 231 Park Ave. , " the building on Lexington . When first-time visitors come , says a St. Regis spokesman , Douglas Eglinton , " they stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pay phone to call for dime ? lions , or perhaps show up 15 minutes late for their appointment . Actually , 15 minutes Is n't bad for finding this building . It has no fewer than five names and addresses . First , all four sides say " 231 Park Ave . " The three sides that do n't face the alley have additional labels : One Is marked 111 E. 45th , one is 466 Lexington , and one Is 100 E. 46th . Finally , all four sides still say " Park Avenue Atrium , " a name the owner used as an Interim image builder before it won the " 231 Park " address . In New York , though , more than a few addresses seem to defy the Visitor to find the place . The city has 63 " plazas " alone , along with a scattering of " towers " and " squares . " Glory for the honoree , rather than cachet for the building , sometimes appears to be the motive for these designations . There is , for Instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former head of the sanitation-men 's union , not to mention the prestigious Holland Tunnel Plaza . New York is also the only city to boast a Harry Biumenstein Plaza , a Martin R. Celle Plaza and a Samuel D. Leldersdorf Plaza . Such addresses are often mystifying , and not just to people from Kansas or Knoxville . One Manhattan real-estate broker expresses typical exasperation : " I 've been In this busi- ness for 30 years , but when a company told me they were at Wall Street Plaza , I had no Idea where that was . " No problem at all . Wall Street Plaza is at 88 Pine Street .
