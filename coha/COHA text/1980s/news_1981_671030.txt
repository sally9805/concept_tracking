" All one has to do is to treat the number of a patrol car as a date , and match it with some significant event , " she says . " Shortly after the New York City fiscal crisis , I observed - in order - the following license-plate numbers on police cars : 1453 ( the fall of Constantinople ) ; 1777 ( the battle of Princeton ) ; 1688 ( the Glorious Revolution in England ) ; 1605 ( Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot ) . I found the juxtapositions quite fascinating. // " Since then , many evocative numbers have surfaced , including 1608 ( Shakespeare ' s ' Othello ' ) ; 1588 ( the defeat of the Spanish Armada ) ; 1691 ( the siege of Limerick ) ; 1829 ( the English Catholic Emancipation Act ) ; 1901 ( the death of Queen Victoria ) ; 1861 ( the beginning of the American Civil War ) . " // However , Professor Ranald says that sometimes the dates must be fudged . " For example , one can say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionheart . And license number 1107 currently stumps me , but I add on from 1066 ( William the Conqueror - and all that ) . This day , however , I discovered 1619 ( the first strike in the New World - the Polish glassworkers in Jamestown ) . " // The variations of the game , she says , " are endless and insomniac - because my personal rules forbid the checking of specific dates . " " And although I have not yet discovered a truly discernible pattern in the allocation of N.Y.P.D. car numbers , " she adds , " the pattern of one ' s identifications tells a lot about an individual ' s interests . I am a literature and history buff , and therefore my examples are heavily weighted in those directions. " // To her surprise , Professor Ranald has had difficulty in finding facts for the 20th century , but " I have noted among others , " she says , " 1907 ( the Deceased Wife ' s Sister ' s Act in England - you could legally marry her ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George V ) ; 1961 ( inauguration of President Kennedy ) . " // " One problem , " she says , " is that the N.Y.P.D. has begun using some 2000 numbers , but I have solved that by substituting ' 1 ' for the first digit , so that today I saw 2805 - read 1805 - ( battle of Trafalgar , death of Nelson ) . So the game is alive and well. // " The game can also be extended to numbered persons - such as the toll collectors of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority .

She was heading home from the Collegiate School , where she works , and had just passed the pond beyond the Delacorte Theater .

" After reflecting that nowhere else could such an explanation have been conceivable , Mrs. Platt suggested that the owner keep the dog on a leash during this difficult period of adjustment . Then she rode home , carefully. // David Galef , formerly of Gotham , has been doing a stint of English teaching in Japan .
