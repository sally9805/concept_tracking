I suppose there 's a time in practically every young boy 's life when he 's affected by that wonderful disease of puppy love . I do n't mean the kind a boy has for the pretty little girl that lives down the road . I mean the real kind , the kind that has four small feet and a wiggly tail , and sharp little teeth that can gnaw on a boy 's finger ; the kind a boy can romp and play with , even eat and sleep with . I was ten years old when I first became infected with this disease . I did n't want just one dog . I wanted two , and not just any kind of a dog . They had to be a special breed . I went to my father and had a talk with him . " Papa , " I said , " I do n't want any old dog . I want hounds  --  coon hounds  --  and I want two of them . " I could tell by the look on his face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Billy , those dogs cost money , and that 's something we do n't have right now . Maybe someday when we can afford it , but not right now . " I did n't give up . After my talk with papa , I went to mamma . I fared no better there . Right off she said I was too young to be hunting with hounds . So there I was , sitting right in the middle of the finest hunting country in the world and did n't even have a dog . Our home was in a beautiful valley far back in the rugged Ozarks . The country was new and sparsely settled . The land we lived on was Cherokee land , allotted to my mother because of the Cherokee blood that flowed in her veins . It lay in a strip from the foothills of the mountains to the banks of the Illinois River in northeastern Oklahoma . The land was rich , black , and fertile . Papa said it would grow hair on a crosscut saw . He was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning plow into the virgin soil . Mamma had picked the spot for our log house . It nestled at the edge of the foothills in the mouth of a small canyon and was surrounded by a grove of huge red oaks . Behind our house one could see miles and miles of the mighty Ozarks . In the spring the aromatic scent of wild flowers , redbuds , papaws , and dogwoods , drifting on the wind currents , spread over the valley and around our home . Below our fields , twisting and winding , ran the clear blue waters of the Illinois River . The banks were cool and shady . The rich bottom land near the river was studded with tall sycamores , birches , and box elders . To a ten-year-old country boy it was the most beautiful place in the whole wide world , and I took advantage of it all . I roamed the hills and the river bottoms . I knew every game trail in the thick canebrakes , and every animal track that was pressed in the mud along the riverbanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks of a river coon . I 'd lie for hours examining them . Before leaving , I 'd take a switch and sweep them all away . These I called my " trail looks . " The next day I 'd hurry back , and sure enough , nine times out of ten , there in the clean-swept ground I would again find the tracks of a ringtail coon . As the days passed , the dog-wanting disease grew worse . I began to see dogs . in my sleep . When the hunting season opened that fall , something happened that was almost more than I could stand . I was lying in bed one night  --  trying to figure out a way I could get some dogs  --  when I heard the deep baying of a coon hound . I got up and opened my window . It came again . The deep voice rang loud and clear in the frosty night . I stayed up and listened to it until the last tones of the hound 's voice died away in the daylight hours . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover my head with a pillow to shut out the sound . It was no use . His voice seemed to bore its way through the pillow and ring in my ears . I had to get up and again go to the window . I 'm sure if that coon hunter had known that he was slowly killing a ten-year-old boy , he would have put a muzzle on his hound . By the time hunting season was over , I was a nervous wreck . My eyes were red and bloodshot . I had lost weight and was as thin as a bean pole . Mamma checked me over . She looked at my tongue and turned back one of my eyelids . Papa came in during this inspection . Mamma told him she was worried about my health . " Aw , " he said , " there 's nothing wrong with him . It 's just because he 's been cooped up all winter . A boy needs sunshine and exercise . He 's almost 11 now , and I 'm going to let him help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles back on him . " 1 thought this was wonderful . I 'd finally grown up to be a man . I was going to help papa with the farm . However , the dog-wanting disease never did leave me altogether . With the new work I was doing , helping papa , it just kind of burned itself down and left a big sore on my heart . Every time I 'd see a coon track down in our fields or along the riverbanks , the old sore would get all festered up and start hurting again . Just when I had given up all hope of ever owning a good hound , something wonderful happened . I found the greatest of treasures , a sportsmen 's magazine , discarded by some fishermen who had camped on the river . I sat down on an old sycamore log and started thumbing through the leaves . On the back pages of the magazine , I came to the For Sale section  --  DOGS FOR SALE  --  every kind of dog . I read on and on . Far down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath away . In small letters , it read , " registered redbone coonhound pups ? $25 each . " The advertisement was from a kennel in Kentucky . I read it over and over . By the time I had memorized the ad , I was seeing dogs , hearing dogs , and even feeling them . The magazine was forgotten . I was lost in thought . The brain of an 11-year-old boy can dream some fantastic dreams . When I left the campground of the fishermen , it was late . As 1 walked along , I took the magazine from my pocket , and again I read the ad . Slowly a plan began to form ; I 'd save the money . I could sell stuff to the fishermen  --  crayfish , minnows , and fresh vegetables . In berry season I could sell at my grandfather 's store all the berries I could pick . I could trap in the winter . The more I planned , the more real it became . There was the way to get those pups ; save my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running errands for my grandpa , and 13C a fisherman had given me for a can of worms . The next morning I went to the trash pile behind the barn . I was looking for a can  --  my bank . I found one , long and slender , with a good , tight lid . I dropped the 23e in the can . The coins looked so small lying there on the bottom , but to me it was a good start . All through that summer I worked like a beaver . In the small creek thatwormed its way down through our fields I caught crayfish with my bare hands . I trapped minnows with an old screen-wire trap I made myself , baited with yellow corn bread from my mother 's kitchen . These were sold to the fishermen , along with fresh vegetables and roasting ears . I tore my way through the blackberry patches until my hands and feet were scratched raw and red from the thorns . I tramped the hills , seeking out the huckleberry bushes . My grandfather , a farmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten cents a bucket for my berries . Once grandpa asked me what I did with the money I earned . I told him I was saving it to buy some dogs . I asked him if he would order them for me when I had saved enough . He said he would . I asked him not to say anything to my father . He promised me he would n't . I 'm sure grandpa paid little attention to my plans . That winter I trapped harder than ever with three little traps I owned . Grandpa sold my hides to fur buyers who came to his store all through the fur season . Prices were low-15c for a large possum hide , 25 for a good skunk hide . Little by little the nickels and dimes added up . The old can grew heavy . The next summer I followed the same routine . A year had passed . I was 12 . I was over the halfway mark . I had $27.46 . My spirits soared . I worked harder . Another year crawled slowly by , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind was over . I had it  --  my $50 ! I cried as I counted it over and over . Early the next morning , with the can jammed deep in a pocket of my overalls , I flew to the store . As I trotted along , I whistled and sang . I felt as big as the tallest mountain in the Ozarks . Arriving at my destination , I saw my grandfather behind the counter . Tugging and pulling , I worked the can out of my pocket and dumped it in front of him . Grandpa was dumfounded . In a voice much louder than he ordinarily used , he asked , " Where did you get all this ? " " I told you , grandpa , " I said , " I was saving my money so I could buy two hound pups . You said you would order them for me . I 've got the money , and now I want you to order them . " Grandpa stared at me over his glasses . " How long have you been saving this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years . " His mouth flew open , and in a loud voice he said , " Two years ! " I nodded my head . The way my grandfather stared at me made me uneasy . I was on needles and pins . Taking his eyes from me , he glanced back at the money . He saw the faded yellow piece of paper sticking out from the coins . He worked it out , asking as he did , " What 's this ? " I told him it was the ad , telling from where to order my dogs . He glanced down at my bare feet and asked , " How come your feet are cut and scratched like that ? " I told him it was pretty tough , picking blackberries barefoot . He nodded his head . It was too much for my grandfather . He turned and walked away . He stood for several seconds with his back toward me . When he turned around , I noticed his eyes were moist . In a quavering voice he said , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and you worked hard . You got it honestly , and you want some dogs . We 're going to get those dogs . Be damned ! Be damned ! " That was as near as I ever heard my grandfather curse , if you can call it cursing . He walked over and picked up the ad again . " Now you go on home , " he said . " I 'll write to these kennels , and I 'll let you know when I get an answer . If we ca n't get the dogs there , we can get them someplace else . And I do n't think , if I were you , I 'd let my pa know anything about this right now . I happen to know he wants to buy another red mule from Old Man Potter . " I told him I would n't and turned to leave the store . As I reached the door , my grandfather said in a loud voice , " Say , it 's been a long time since you 've had anycandy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " he said , " we 'll have to do something about that . " Walking over behind the counter , he reached and got a sack . I noticed it was n't one of the nickel sacks . It was one of the quarter kind . My eyes never left my grandfather 's hand . Time after time it dipped in and out of the candy counter ; peppermint sticks , jawbreakers , horehounds , and gumdrops . The sack bulged . So did my eyes . On my way home , with a jawbreaker in one side of my mouth and a piece of horehound in the other , I skipped and hopped ; I had the finest grandpa in the world , and I was the happiest boy in the world . 1 wanted to share my happiness with my sisters but decided not to say anything about ordering the pups . Arriving home , I dumped the sack of candy out on the bed . Six little hands helped themselves . I was well repaid by the love and adoration . I saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Day after day I flew to the store . Grandpa would shake his head . Then on a Monday , as I entered the store , grandpa told me the letter had come . The kennels were still there , and they had dogs for sale . He said he had made the mail buggy wait while he made out the order . And , another thing , the dog market had gone downhill . The price of dogs had dropped five dollars . He handed me a ten-dollar bill . " Now , there 's still one stump in the way , " he said . " The mail buggy ca n't carry things like dogs , so they 'll come as far as the depot at Tahlequah , but you 'll get the notice here in a couple of weeks . " I thanked my grandfather with all my heart and asked him how I was going to get my dogs out from Tahlequah . " Well , there 's always someone going in , ' he said , " and you could ride in with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still no word about my dogs . Terrible thoughts ran through my mind . Maybe my dogs were lost ; the train had a wreck ; someone stole my money ; or , perhaps the mailman lost my order . Then at the end of the second week the notice came . My grandfather told me that he had talked to Jim Hodges that day . He was going into town in about a week , and I could ride in with him to pick up my dogs . Again I thanked my grandfather . I started for home . Walking along in deep thought , I decided it was time to tell my father the whole story . I fully intended to tell him that evening . I tried several times , but somehow I could n't . I was n't scared of him , for he never whipped me . He was always kind and gentle , but for some reason ? I do n't know why  --  I just could n't tell him . That night , snuggled deep in the soft folds of a feather bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dogs , and I so desperately wanted to see them and hold them , I did n't want to wait a whole week . In a flash I made up my mind . Very quietly I got up and put on my clothes and put my money in a pocket . I sneaked into the kitchen and got one of mamma 's precious flour sacks . In it I put six eggs , some leftover corn bread , a little salt , and a few matches . Next I went to the smokehouse and cut off a piece of salt pork . I stopped at the barn and picked up a gunnysack . I put the flour sack inside the gunnysack . This I rolled up and crammed in the bib of my overalls . Then I was on my way . I was going after my dogs . Tahlequah was a small , country town with a population of about 800 . By the road it was 32 miles away , but as the crow flies , it was only 20 miles . I went as the crow flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the northeast . At the outskirts of town I hid my flour sack and provisions , and kept the gunnysack . I walked into town . / was scared of Tahlequah and the people . I had never seen such a big town and so many people . There was store after store , some of them two stories high . Passing a large store window , I stopped and stared . There in the window was the most wonderful sight I had ever seen ; everything under the sun ; overalls , jackets , bolts of beautiful cloth , new harnesses , collars and bridles ; and then my eyes did pop . There were several guns , and one of them had two barrels . I could n't believe it  --  two barrels . I had seen many guns , but never one with two barrels . As I turned to leave , my eyes again fell on the overalls and the bolts of cloth . I thought of my mother , father and sisters . Here was an opportunity to make amends for leaving home without telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of overalls for papa . After telling the storekeeper how big my mother and sisters were , I bought several yards of cloth . I also bought a large sack of candy . Out on the street I picked out a friendly looking old man and asked him where the depot was . He told me to go down to the last street and turn right , go as far as I could , and I could n't miss it . I thanked him and started on my way . On arriving at the depot , I peeked in a window . I saw the stationmaster looking at me and smiling . He opened the door and came out on the platform . He asked me where I lived . I told him , " Up the river a ways . " " You know , " he said , " I have some puppies in there for a boy that lives up the river . His name is Billy Colman . I know his dad , but neverhave seen the boy . I figured he would be in after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart jumped clear up in my throat . I looked up and tried to tell him who I was , but something went wrong . When the words finally came out , they sounded like the squeaky old pulley on our well when mamma drew up a bucket of water . I could see a twinkle in his eyes . In a friendly voice he said , " So you 're Billy Colman . How is your dad ? " I told him papa was fine and handed him the notice my grandpa had given me . " They sure are fine-looking pups , " he said . " Do you want box and all ? " I told him I did n't want the box . All I wanted was the dogs . " How are you going to carry them ? " he asked . " I think they are a little too young to follow . " I held out my gunnysack . He looked at me and looked at the sack . Chuckling , he said , " Well , I guess dogs can be carried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut a couple of holes to stick their heads through so that they wo n't smother . " Getting a claw hammer , he tore off the top of the box . He reached in , lifted the pups out and set them down on the floor . " Well , there they are , " he said . " What do you think of them ? " I did n't answer . I could n't . All I could do was stare at them . They seemed to be blinded by the light and kept blinking their eyes . One sat down on his little rear and started crying . The other one was waddling around and whimpering . One pup started my way . I held my breath . On he came until I felt a scratchy little foot on mine . The other pup followed . A warm puppy tongue caressed my sore foot . I heard the stationmaster say , " They already know you . " I knelt down and gathered them in my arms . I buried my face between their wiggling bodies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dogs and a boy , waited in silence . Rising with the two pups held close to my chest , I asked if I owed anything . He said , " There is a small feed bill , but I 'll take care of it . It 's not much anyway . " Taking his knife , he cut two slits in the sack . He put the pups in it and worked their heads through the holes . As he handed the sack to me , he said , " Well , there you are . Good-by and good hunting ! " On the outskirts of town I stopped and picked up a can , in which to boil my eggs , and my provisions . I had n't gone far before I realized that I had undertaken a tough job . The sack became heavier and heavier . Deep in the heart of the Sparrow Hawk Mountains night overtook me . There , in a cave with a stream close by , / put up for the night . After the bed was made I built a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I boiled three eggs . Next I boiled half of the remaining salt pork . Cutting the meat up in small pieces , I fed it to my pups . While they were busy playing , I dragged up several large timbers and built a fire that would last for hours . In a short time the cave grew warm and comfortable from the heat . The leaves were soft and felt good to my tired body and sore feet . As I lay stretched out , my pups crawled all over me . I noticed the boy dog was much larger than the girl dog . He was a deeper red in color . His chest was broad and solid . His puppy muscles knotted and rippled under the velvety skin . He was different in every way . He would go closer to the fire . I saw right away that he was bold and aggressive . Puppy though he was , he did something that brought a smile to my face . Getting as close as he could to the side of the cave , he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every jump , he made it through the heat and sailed into the pile of leaves . He had had enough . Curling up in a ball close to me , he went to sleep . The girl pup was small and timid . Her legs and body were short . Her head was small and delicate . She must have been a runt in the litter . I did n't have to look twice to see that what she lacked in power she made up in brains . She was much smarter than the boy dog , more sure of herself , more cautious . I knew that when the trail became tough , she would be the one to unravel it . I knew I had a wonderful combination . In my dogs I had not only the power but also the brains along with it . Tired but happy , I fell asleep . The bright morning sun was a welcome sight . I fixed breakfast , and soon we were on our way . About midday I entered country I knew . I was n't far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to tell my mother and father . I could think of nothing . Finally I decided I would just tell them the truth , and with the help of the new overalls , cloth and candy , I would weather the storm . As I went on , the thought came , " I have n't named them . " Mumbling names over and over , I glanced up . There , carved in the whitish bark of a sycamore tree , was a large heart . In the center of the heart were two names , DAN and ANN . The name " Dan " was a little larger than " Ann . " It was wide and bold . The scar stood out more . The name " Ann " was small , neat , and even . I stared , unbelieving , for there were my names . They were perfect . I walked over and picked up my pups . Looking at him , I said , " Your name is Dan . I 'll call you Old Dan . " Looking at her , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann . I 'll call you Little Ann . " Reaching our house , my bare feet made no noise as I crossed the porch . With my free hand I reached and pulled the leather that worked the latch . Slowly the door swung inward . My mother was directly in front of the door , sitting in her old cane-bottom rocker , knitting . She looked up . I saw all the worry and grief leave her eyes . Her head bowed down . The knitting in her hands came up to cover her face . I stepped inside the room . The booming voice of my father startled me . He said , " Well , what have you got there ? " Laughing , he got up from his chair and came over to me . He reached and took the sack from my shoulder . " When we started looking for you , " he said , " I went to the store , and your grandpa told me all about it . It was n't too hard to figure out what you had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and , dropping to my knees , I buried my face in her lap . Between sobs , I heard the squeals of delight from my sisters as they fondled my pups . I heard my father say , " What 's this other stuff you 've got ? " Without raising my head from my mother 's lap , in a choking voice I said , " One is for you , one is for mamma , and the other is for the girls . " Realizing that everything was forgiven , I stood up and dried my eyes . Papa was pleased with his new overalls . My sisters forgot the pups for the candy . The light that was shining from my mother 's eyes as she fingered the cheap cotton cloth was something I will never forget . The next morning papa asked me when I was going to start training my dogs . " I do n't know , " I said . " Do you think they 're too young ? " " No , I do n't think so , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better it is . " " Well , in that case , " I said , " I 'll start tomorrow . " With the help of my oldest sister , I started giving my pups their first lessons . She would hold their collars while I made trails with an old coonskin for them to follow . It was a beautiful sight to see my pups work those trails . At first they were awkward and did n't know what to do , but they would never quit trying . Old Dan would get so eager and excited that he would overrun a trail . Where it twisted or turned , he would run straight on , bawling up a storm . It did n't take him long to realize that a smart old coon did n't always run in a straight line . Little Ann never overran a trail . She would wiggle and twist , cry and whine , and pretty soon she would figure it out . At first they were afraid of water . They would follow the trail to the stream and stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beg for help . With a pup under each arm I 'd wade . out into the stream and set them down in the cool water . Nine times out of ten , one pup would swim one way , and the other one would go just the opposite way . I had a time with this part of their training , but my persistence had no bounds . It was n't long until they loved the water . Old Dan would jump as far out as he could and practically knock the river dry . Little Ann would ease herself in and swim like a muskrat for the opposite shore . I taught my dogs every trick I knew and any new ones I heard about . I taught them how to split up on a riverbank to search for the hidden trail , because it was impossible to tell where a coon would come out of the water . Sometimes he might swim downstream , and other times he might swim upstream . Maybe he would come back to the bank he had just left , or he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop in the middle of the stream on an old drift . One of the favorite tricks of a smart old ringtail is the tree-barking trick . This he accomplishes by running far up on the side of a tree and , using his stout legs for leverage , springing 20 or 30 feet away before touching the ground . Dumb hounds trail up to the tree and start bawling " treed . " I taught my dogs to circle for a good hundred yards to be sure he was still in the tree before bawling . In order to learn more about coon hunting , I 'd hang around my grandfather 's store and listen to the stories told by the coon hunters . Some of the tales 1 heard were long and tall , but Ibelieved them all . I could always tell by the twinkle in his eyes when grandpa was kidding me . He told me how a coon could climb right up the fog and disappear in the stars , and how he could leap on a horse ' back and run him over your dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the tall tales . Anything that had a coon hair in it I believed completely . All through that summer and into the late fall the training went on . Although I was worn down to a frazzle , I was a happy boy . I figured 1 was ready for the ringtails . Late one evening , tired and exhausted , I sat down by a big sycamore and called my dogs to me . " It 's all over , " I said . " There 'll be no more lessons . I 've worked hard , and I 've done my best . From now on it 's all up to you . Hunting season is just a few days away , and I 'm going to let you rest , for I want you to be in good shape the night it opens . " It was wonderful indeed how I could have heart-to-heart talks with my dogs , and they always seemed to understand . Each question I asked was answered in their own way . Sometimes I would see the answer in their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their tails . Other times I could hear the answer in a low whine or feel it in the soft caress of a warm , flicking tongue . In some way they would always answer . The day hunting season opened I was as nervous as Sammy , our house cat . I cleaned my lantern and filled it with oil . With hog lard I greased my boots until they were as soft as a hummingbird 's nest . I was grinding my ax when papa came around . He smiled as he said , " This is the big night , is n't it ? " " It sure is , papa , " I said , " and I 've waited a long time for it . " " Yes , I know , " he said . " I 've been thinking  --  there 's not too much to do around here during the hunting season . I 'm pretty sure I can take care of things , so you just go ahead and hunt all you want to . " " Thanks , papa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out pretty late at night , and I 'll probably have to do a lot of sleeping in the daytime . " Papa started frowning . " You know , " he said , " although you are almost 14 , your mother does n't like this hunting of yours very much . She 's worried about you being out all by yourself . Now , just to be on the safe side , I think it would be a good idea for you to tell us where you 'll be hunting . Then if anything happens , we 'll know where to look . " I told him I would , but I did n't think anything was going to happen . After papa had left , started thinking , He does n't even talk to me like I was a boy any more . He talks to me like I was a man . These wonderful thoughts made me feel just about as big as our old red mule . I had a good talk with my dogs . " I 've waited almost three years for this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been easy . I 've taught you everything I know , and I want you to do your best . " Little Ann acted like she understood . She whined and saved me a wash job on my face . Old Dan may have , but he did n't act like it . He just lay there in the sunshine , all stretched out and limber as a rag . During supper mamma asked me where I was going to hunt . " I 'm not going far , " I said , " just down on the river . " I could tell mamma was worried , and it did n't make me feel too good . " Billy , " she said , " 1 do n't approve of this hunting , but it looks like I ca n't say no ; not after all you 've been through , getting your dogs and all that training . But I ca n't help worrying . " " There wo n't be anything happen , " I said . " I promise I 'll be careful . " While mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He handed it to me and said , " I 'd like to see a big coonskin on the smokehouse wall in the morning . " The whole family followed me out on the porch . There we all got a surprise . My dogs were sitting on the steps waiting for me . I heard papa laugh . " Why , they know you 're going hunting , " he said , " know it as well as anything . " " Well , I never , " mamma said . " Do you really think they do ? It does look like they do . Why , just look at them . " Little Ann started wiggling and twisting . Old Dan trotted out to the gate , stopped , turned around and looked at me . " Sure , they know Billy 's going hunting , " piped the little one , " and I know why . " " How do you know so much , silly ? " asked my oldest sister . " Because I told Little Ann , that 's why , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how they know . " We all had to laugh at her . It was a beautiful night , still and frosty . A big , grinning Ozark moon had the countryside bathed in a soft , yellow glow . Just before I reached the timber , I called my dogs to me . " Now the trail will be a little different tonight , " I whispered . " It wo n't be a hide dragged on the ground . It 'll be the real thing , so remember everything I taught you , and I 'm depending on you . Just put one up a tree , and I 'll do the rest . " I turned them loose , saying , " Go get ' em . " They streaked for the timber . Although my eyes were seeing the wonders of the night , my ears were ever alert , listening for the sound of my hounds telling me they had found a trail . I was expecting one of them to bawl , but when it came it startled me . The deep tones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dropped my ax and almost dropped my lantern . A strange feeling came over me . I took a deep breath and threw back my head to give the call of the hunter , but something went wrong . My throat felt like it had been tied in a knot . I swallowed a couple of times , and the knot disappeared . As loud as I could , I whooped , " Who-e-e-e . Get him , Dan . Get him . " Little Ann came in . The bell-like tones of her voice made shivers run up and down my spine . I whooped to her . " Who-e-e-e . Tell it to him , little girl . Tell it to him . " This is what 1 had prayed , worked , and sweated for  --  my own little hounds bawling on the trail of a river coon . They straightened the trail out and headed down river . I took off after them as fast as I could run . A mile downstream the coon pulled his first trick . I could tell by my dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to them , they were out on an old drift , sniffing around . The coon had pulled a simple trick . He had run out on the drift , leaped into the water and crossed the river . To anexperienced coon hound the crude trick would have been nothing at all , but my dogs were just big , awkward pups trailing their first live coon . I stood and watched , wondering if they would remember the training I had given them . Now and then I would whoop , urging them on . Old Dan was having a fit . He whined and he bawled . He whimpered and cried . He came to me and reared up , begging for help . " I 'm not going to help you , " I scolded , " and you 're not going to find him on that drift . If you would just remember some of the training I gave you , you 'd find the trail . Now go find that coon . " He ran back out on the drift and started searching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading in her warm , gray eyes . " I 'm ashamed of you , little girl , " I said . " I thought you had more sense than this . If you let him fool you this easily , you 'll never be a coon dog . " She whined , turned , and trotted downstream to search again for the lost trail . I could n't understand . Had all the training I had given them been useless ? I knew if I waded the river they would follow me . Once on the other side , it would be easy for them to find the trail . I did n't want it that way . I wanted them to figure it out themselves . The more I thought about it , the more disgusted I became . I sat down and buried my face in my arms . Out on the drift Old Dan started whining . It made me angry , and I got up to scold him again . I could n't understand his actions . He was running along the edge of the drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . I could see something swimming for the opposite shore . At first I thought it was a muskrat . In the middle of the stream , where the moonlight was the brightest , I got a good look . It was Little Ann . With a loud whoop , I told her how proud I was . My little girl had remembered her training . She came out on a gravel bar , shook the water from her body , and 94 disappeared in the thick timber . Minutes later she let me know she had found the trail . Before the tones of her voice had died away , Old Dan plowed into the water . He was so eager to join her I could hear him whining as he swam . I was hurrying along , looking for a shallow riffle so I could wade across , when the voices of my dogs stopped . I waited and listened . They opened up again on my side of the stream . The coon had crossed back over . I could n't help smiling . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . The next trick the old fellow pulled was a dandy . He climbed a large water oak standing about ten feet from the river and simply disappeared . I got there in time to see my dogs swimming for the opposite shore . For a half-hour they worked that bank . Not finding the trail , they swam back . I stood and watched them . They practically tore the riverbank to pieces looking for the trail . Old Dan knew the coon had climbed the water oak . He went back , reared up on it and bawled a few times . " There 's no use in doing that , boy , " I said . " I know he climbed it , but he 's not there now . Maybe it 's like grandpa said , he just climbed right on out through the top and disappeared in the stars . " My dogs did n't know it , but I was pretty well convinced that that was what the coon had done . They would n't give up . Once again they crossed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coon had n't touched that bank . They came back . Old Dan went up the river , and Little Ann worked downstream . An hour and a half later they gave up , came to me , and begged for help . I knelt down between their wet bodies . While I scratched and petted them , I let them know that I still loved them . " I 'm not mad , " I said . " I know you did your best . If that coon can fool all of us , then we 're just beat . We 'll go someplace else to hunt . He 's not the only coon in these bottoms . " Just as I picked up my ax and lantern , Little Ann let out a bawl and tore out down the riverbank . Old Dan , with a bewildered look on his face , stood for a moment looking after her . Then , raising his head high in the air , he made my eardrums ring with his deep voice . I could hear the underbrush popping as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had taken place . Surely Little Ann had heard or seen something . I could tell by their voices that whatever it was they were after , they were close enough to see it and were probably running by sight . The animal left the bottoms and headed for the mountains . Whatever it was , it must have realized my dogs were crowding it too closely . At the edge of the foothills it turned and came back toward the river . I was still trying to figure out what was going on when I realized that , on striking the river , the animal had again turned and was coming straight toward me . I set my lantern down and tightened my grip on the ax . I was standing my ground quite well when visions of bears , lions , and all other kinds of animals started flashing across my mind . I jumped behind a big sycamore and was trying hard to press my body into the tree when a big coon came tearing by . Twenty-five yards behind him came my dogs , running side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , bawling every time their feet touched the ground . After seeing that there was nothing to be scared of , once again I was the fearless hunter , screaming and yelling as loud as I could , " Get him , boy , get him . " Holding my breath , I stood still and waited . Then it came , the long-drawn-out bawl of the tree bark . My little hounds had done it . They had treed their first coon .
