With time running out before the state rules on a controversial landfill proposed for northwest Cook County , an opposition group said Tuesday that neither it nor the state has enough time to evaluate recent changes in the project ' s design . The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency will probably announce on Thursday its decision on the hotly debated balefill , so called because garbage would be baled before dumping . A Thursday decision is important because zoning for the balefill expires at the end of the day unless the state approves the plans . Following a public hearing in September , the Illinois EPA notified the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County ( SWANCC ) of several problems with the balefill design . The solid waste agency , which wants to put the balefill in an old gravel quarry near Bartlett , is a consortium of north and northwest Cook County suburbs . In response to the state , the solid waste agency last week added more wells to the design for monitoring ground water under and around the site and made other changes as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record on the balefill closed on Oct. 19 and no further exchanges between the state and the local agency were supposed to take place . The state has extended the closing date of the official record to Wednesday , but the citizens ' group was not informed of the extension until last Thursday , said vice president Mary Byrne . " They have been continuing negotiations with SWANCC all this time , and they haven ' t told anyone else so we could give our input , " Byrne said . " Our rights have been violated right down the line . " Bill Abolt , director of the local solid waste agency , contended that state officials said during the hearing that if they had questions , they would contact the local agency . " That ' s what they did , " he said . " It is absolutely essential that a technical dialogue take place .

" We are going to make a decision on Thursday if our review is concluded , " said Larry Eastep of the IEPA . " If for some reason there was something wrong with the review , then we wouldn ' t make the decision . The zoning approval expires on Thursday and the agency is aware of that . " Eastep said he does not expect " a lot of voluminous comments from people " because the design changes dealt with longstanding issues that have been the subject of citizen comments already . " We think we can get through them all , " he said . The Thursday deadline was a condition set by the Cook County Board when it approved zoning for the balefill in November , 1987 . The IEPA is considering the balefill for the second time .
