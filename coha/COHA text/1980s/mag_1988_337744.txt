Despite his reputation as a plodding and phlegmatic diplomat , Secretary of State George Shultz does not lack for energy . His wanderings over the past two weeks in search of a Middle East peace have taken him to Jerusalem , Amman , Damascus , Cairo and London , where Jordan 's King Hussein met with him between bouts of dental surgery . After two days of NATO summitry in Brussels , the Shultz shuttle , with Ronald Reagan 's blessing , rumbled back to London before heading to the Middle East again . Said an elated senior diplomat aboard Shultz 's plane : " It 's the only game in town . " <P> The game , however , is as complex as a grand-master chess tournament , and by the end of the trip Shultz had made his boldest move yet : offering the players the first U.S.-sponsored peace plan since 1982 . He presented a proposal that calls for final talks , to begin by year 's end , on a permanent solution to the Palestinian question . While many predicted Shultz 's scheme would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a readiness to work to change things that should be taken advantage of by everybody . The moment can be lost . " <P> Shultz 's blueprint has three parts : an international " event " in April to inaugurate the peace process ; talks between Israel and a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation beginning in May to arrange for elections and a degree of self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip ; negotiations starting in December for final disposition of all occupied territories , including the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem , which Israel has annexed . Shultz , who presented the plan to Israel , Jordan , Egypt and Syria , wants at least a positive sign of interest from all four countries by next week , when Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is scheduled to visit Washington . <P> A unanimous " yes , " however , is highly unlikely . In more than nine hours of talks with Shultz , Shamir stubbornly stuck to his position that he will never exchange territory for peace . But with some reluctance the Prime Minister did agree to an international conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs may find difficult to accept . The Arabs , in the meantime , were creating their own complications . The angry Palestinians who have led the uprising in the occupied territories have not only heeded the Palestine Liberation Organization and refused to meet with Shultz , but also now balk at being made part of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation , a formula that dates back to 1985 . <P> Meanwhile , blood continued to be spilled in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , where at least six more Palestinian deaths were reported . Though the violence is three months old , Israeli TV viewers were shocked last week when the state- owned station ran footage of four soldiers savagely beating two bound Palestinians . The segment , filmed by a CBS crew and shown on U.S. television two weeks ago , was heavily edited , but the clips were still more graphic than Israelis are accustomed to seeing . <P> Faced with the flood of negative publicity , the Cabinet was seriously considering a simplistic solution last week : ban the press from the occupied territories . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , authorities did close parts of the West Bank to reporters .
