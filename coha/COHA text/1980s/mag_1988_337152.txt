" The economy is a mess . We are behind in every area . . . We have forgotten how to work . " <P> At the Central Committee Plenum , Jan. 28 , 1987 <P> Officials of the Zavorovo state farm near Moscow had prepared carefully for the big day last August . They had even built a special staircase to spare their distinguished visitor the indignity of climbing down a hill to the potato fields below the main road . Mikhail Gorbachev would have none of it . Stepping out of his ZIL limousine , he gave the staircase a dismissive wave and scrambled down the steep incline in his neatly pressed gray business suit , leaving his surprised entourage to run after him in full view of television cameras . <P> At the bottom of the hill , Gorbachev asked the farmers , lined up beside their equipment like soldiers on parade , about the mood on the farm . " Good . Businesslike , " came the replies . Gorbachev was not satisfied . " I always hear the same answer , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always problems . " For example , he asked , was everything available " except for vodka , " a teasing reference to his antialcoholism campaign . Well , no , one farmer mumbled . It was the season for making jams and jellies , and sugar was scarce . Gorbachev shot back : Do you know why ? Moonshiners are buying up all the sugar to make home brew . " Let 's talk straight with one another , " said the leader . " Is n't it time to bring the making of moonshine to an end ? That sort of people belong back in the times when the dinosaurs lived . " <P> That exchange was typical of the Gorbachev style , a remarkably Western mix of charm and sermonizing . The effect was apparent during the December summit with Ronald Reagan . Alternately jovial and argumentative , combining sharp intelligence with a homey touch and playing to the camera in the most effective way  --  by seeming to ignore it  --  he came across as a Kremlin version of the Great Communicator . Add an attractive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete . <P> Also misleading . In most of his views , Gorbachev is a thoroughly Soviet , obdurately Communist figure . When he speaks of " democracy , " as he incessantly does , he does not mean anything Thomas Jefferson would have recognized ; he promotes freer discussion within the Communist Party only as a substitute for the political opposition he makes clear he will not tolerate . If he voices criticism of Soviet society , it is because that system has in his view strayed from the ideals of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin , the founder of the Soviet state and Gorbachev 's idol . And though he argues frequently for a new relationship with the U.S. , he seems to have an odd conception of America as a Dickensian hell ruled by the military-industrial complex .
