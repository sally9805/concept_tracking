Where were you on the night of March 23 ? Out dancing , perhaps , or attending a PTA meeting or just sitting at home watching L.A. Law ? If so , you did not realize how close you came to disaster . While you were blissfully unaware of the danger , a huge asteroid whizzed past the earth , coming closer than any other such heavenly body seen in 52 years . If the giant clump of rock  --  half a mile across by one estimate  --  had hit the planet , it would have packed the wallop of thousands of H-bombs and possibly killed millions of people . If it had come down in an ocean , it could have triggered tidal waves hundreds of yards high . <P> Before you become alarmed , however , you should understand that this was a close encounter only in a relative sense . At its closest , the asteroid was about 450,000 miles away , roughly twice the distance between the earth and the moon . Still , in cosmic terms it was virtually a direct hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Hermes , a minor planet nearly half a mile in diameter , passed by at about the same distance . <P> The new asteroid , called 1989FC in accord with the official numbering system of the International Astronomical Union , was first detected by Henry Holt , an adjunct professor of geology at Northern Arizona University . That was in late March , after it was already moving safely away from earth . Holt spotted the speeding intruder in photographs taken through an 18-in. telescope at the Palomar Observatory in Southern California , during a systematic search for asteroids passing close by , which scientists call earth grazers . Holt figures that 1989FC may be in Hermes ' league , but other astronomers dispute the claim , saying the new asteroid may be only 100 yds. across . Even if the smaller size is correct , no one would want to have 1989FC land in the backyard . A 100-yd. - wide asteroid hitting the earth at a speed of nearly 50,000 m.p.h. could dig a crater a mile or so across and several hundred feet deep  --  similar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Meteor Crater , that was blasted out some 40,000 years ago . Such an impact today would be enough to wipe out a major population center . <P> Ominously , astronomers say 1989FC will be back . Like the earth , the asteroid orbits the sun , but it takes about 380 days to do so , instead of 365 . When the asteroid passes by again next April , it will probably be at a safer distance from the earth . The next time earthlings need to worry , says astronomer Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory , who calculated the orbit based on Holt 's observations , is 2015 . " If our figures are correct , " he says , " the asteroid will have made 25 orbits to earth 's 26 , and we will meet again . " <P> That could mean a direct hit or , more probably , another nerve-jangling near miss . But even if 1989FC never strikes earth , a similar asteroid is destined to do so eventually . It has happened so many times before , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon 's were it not for the cosmetic effects of erosion caused by the oceans and atmosphere . Half-mile asteroids are a dime a dozen in the solar system , and they run into the planet once every 100,000 years , on average . That means the next one could strike in a thousand lifetimes  --  or before the end of next week .
