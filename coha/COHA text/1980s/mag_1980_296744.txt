Investigators are baffled by black leader 's shooting <P> He sat up in bed , watched TV and , with a nurse 's assistance , even stood briefly . Vernon Jordan , president of the National Urban League , was making a slow but steady recovery from gunshot wounds that felled him in the parking lot of the Marriott Inn in Fort Wayne , Ind . But the police and FBI were making little progress last week in tracking down the would-be killer of the civil rights leader . <P> Investigators combed the site of the shooting for evidence and interviewed more than 400 people nationwide . They turned up no clues , but they did manage virtually to dispel some theories . One was that Jordan 's attractive blond companion , Martha Coleman , 36 , a longtime civil rights worker in Fort Wayne , was in any way involved in the attack .

Said the FBI 'S Young : " We have a lot of leads and a lot of theories-perhaps too many theories . " One of them stems from Coleman 's report that a motorcyclist had preceded her car on the 15-minute drive to the motel , timing the green lights perfectly . ( Could the motorcyclist have been a spotter for the gunman ? ) Said Young : " We 're a long way from the end . " But he added : " Remember , it took us a long time to find Patty Hearst .
