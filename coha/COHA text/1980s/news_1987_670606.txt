After some early delays , a search panel appointed by the Board of Education has narrowed its list of candidates to three . The president of the board , Robert F. Wagner Jr. , has said he would like to name a new Chancellor by Friday , the beginning of the new year and the day after Mr. Quinones is to depart. // One of the three finalists recommended by the search panel , Dr. Richard C. Wallace Jr . , Superintendent of Schools in Pittsburgh , has already been interviewed by the board . The others - Dr. Richard R. Green , Superintendent of Schools in Minneapolis , and Dr. Constance E. Clayton , who heads the public school system in Philadelphia - are to be interviewed this week . The board is not bound to take any of these candidates , although Mr. Wagner has said it most probably would do so. // As the board deliberates , it will be grappling with a number of difficult and politically charged issues . There is the question of race : in a school system with an enrollment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate surrounding the Howard Beach case , should the new Chancellor be black ? It will also grapple with the fact that none of the candidates has any experience in New York City and that two of them - Dr . Clayton and Dr. Green - have not lived or worked outside their hometowns. // And the board will also have to deal with another problem : how it gives managerial and political support to a new Schools Chancellor , who would be paid more than the current salary of $125 , 000 , in the face of turmoil , both in city government and in the State Legislature , over what should be done about the grave problems facing New York ' s schools. // Here are sketches of the three finalists : <> <> Dr. Richard C. Wallace Jr. // Dr. Richard C. Wallace Jr. , 56 years old , went to head the Pittsburgh school system - 40 , 000 students and 80 schools - in 1980 from Fitchburg , Mass. , a small and poor school system of 4 , 000 students . Dr. Wallace said in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system 10 times the size of his previous district he could manage the leap from Pittsburgh to New York , which is more than 20 times the size of his current district . " Obviously , anyone taking on the largest city school system would have to have some concerns , " he said . " But others have done it. " // During his three-hour interview with the New York City Board of Education last week , Dr. Wallace , who is white , pointed to the gains in scores of minority schoolchildren in Pittsburgh in the past five years . ( The Pittsburgh school system is 52. 2 percent black , 46. 4 percent white and 1. 4 percent other groups ) . <> <> Blacks Show Improvement // When he arrived in the district , black students were scoring more than 30 percentage points lower than white students . In recent years , that has narrowed . Last year , on a national test , 64 percent of black students scored at or near the national norm in reading , compared with 81 percent of white students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far from satisfied. // Closing the gap between black and white students is among the top educational priorities of the Pittsburgh Board of Education , he said. // Perhaps more than any other urban school superintendent , Dr. Wallace , who is paid $74 , 000 , is credited with finding , training and advancing minorities as principals and assistant principals . About 33 percent of the administrators in the Pittsburgh schools are from minority groups , compared with about 18 percent in the New York City schools , where almost 80 percent of the students are from minority groups . <> <> Teacher Retraining // Dr. Wallace harnessed local corporate and foundation support to start the Schenley Teachers Center , where all high school teachers must go for retraining . A similar retraining center has opened for elementary school teachers and a center is to get under way next year for middle school teachers . The Schenley Center has been praised by Theodore Sizer , professor of education at Brown University and a frequent critic of many urban school districts . " I was very impressed with the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it worked but because the district recognized that it had to invest in its people and did so in a thorough and thoughtful way. " // A graduate of the University of Maine who received a master ' s degree and a doctorate in education from Boston College , Dr. Wallace began working in Pittsburgh amid some distrust . Through careful planning of programs and a commitment to minority students , educators in Pittsburgh said , he has made converts of those who were skeptical and has been able to work smoothly with the school board. // Dr. Wallace said he was not concerned about getting along with school and political officials , even in New York City , where there is some doubt about the future composition of the Board of Education . The makeup of the board , he said , was " not the critical issue. " // " As to what the governance is , to me that is not the point , " he said . " I work well with boards . I ' m more concerned with delivering effective services to the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Dr. Constance E. Clayton // Dr. Constance E. Clayton , 52 , became Superintendent of Schools in Philadelphia in 1982 , and was the first woman and the first black to head the financially and academically troubled system of 200 , 000 students. // Of the three candidates for New York City Schools Chancellor , Dr. Clayton heads the largest system . But even so , it is one-fifth the size of the New York City system . At present , 64 percent of the Philadelphia students are black , 24 percent are white , 9 percent are Hispanic students and 3 percent are Asian . Dr. Clayton is known as a hard taskmaster with a good sense of public relations : she is said to be the most visible superintendent Philadelphia has ever had . <> <> Hands-On Reputation // Dr. Clayton is a graduate of the Philadelphia public schools and Temple University in Philadelphia , and she received a doctorate in education from the University of Pennsylvania . Her tendency is to be a hands-on administrator who signs every note , letter and pronouncement from her office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns $100 , 000 a year , making her the highest-paid public official in Philadelphia. // When Dr. Clayton took over the school system - with the strong backing of the Mayor then , William Green - she talked a great deal about the inequities among the schools . To correct what she saw as one of the system ' s greatest failings , she insisted on a standardized curriculum : every school was to teach each subject in the same way and at a similar pace . On this issue , she won the support of the leadership of the teachers ' union , if not of all the rank and file , some of whom complained that the uniform curriculum quashed innovation in the classrooms. // One teacher complained , " You ' re not only told how to teach a thank-you note , you are told it has to be two paragraphs . " <> <> Budget Turnaround // This year , a study at the University of Pennsylvania showed that the curriculum was being largely ignored by high school teachers. // As measured by the district ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Clayton - student math and reading scores in the elementary grades have improved . She is also praised for winning support from the business community . She inherited a $78. 7 million budget deficit but has produced surpluses in each of the last four years. // Last year , Dr. Clayton was at the center of a feud with the Philadelphia Association of School Administrators , the union that represents the city ' s principals . The president of the union , Daniel McGinley , charged Dr. Clayton with " union busting " after she outlined a plan under which principals would become directly involved in the management of the schools . When contract talks reached an impasse and Dr. Clayton and the board announced they were abandoning plans for a new agreement , the principals voted by a 4-to-1 ratio to affiliate with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . <> <> Dr. Richard R. Green // Dr. Richard R. Green was described recently as having the " finesse of a Harvard Ph . D and the combativeness of a street brawler . " Raised in the poor north section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51 , has spent his entire career in Minneapolis : as a teacher , principal and finally as superintendent of the 50-school , 40 , 000-student system since 1980. // He has not been afraid to speak his mind or to take action . When he first took over the financially weak school system , Dr. Green weathered a public storm over his decision to close 18 underused schools and to use the savings to improve the programs in the remaining schools . <> <> Debate Over Testing // Then , in 1983 , he drew national attention by introducing so-called benchmark tests for children in kindergarten . If students failed these tests , they were held back a year and were given special help . The idea of holding back 4-year-olds drew considerable debate about whether such tough action produced better results in the long run , but Dr. Green has stuck with it. // " We do not want to produce adults who can not read and write , he said recently , " and whatever investment it takes to prevent that , we ' re prepared to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Benchmark tests were added after 1983 to grades 2 , 5 , 7 and 9. // Forty-five percent of the enrollment in Minneapolis is made up of Hispanic students , blacks , Asians and American Indians , although the minority-group population of the city is only 15 percent . Like other cities , Minneapolis is struggling to hold on to middle-class enrollment , both black and white . A survey last year found that one-third of the families with children in Minneapolis plan to leave the city , almost double the number six years ago . <> <> Parental Criticism // The dropout rates in the city have risen in the past four years from 7. 8 percent to 8. 9 percent largely because of the high rate among American Indians . Blacks and Indians , who make up one-third of the enrollment , have dropout rates of 10. 8 and 17. 8 percent , respectively. // In the past several years , Dr. Green , who is black and earns $86 , 887 , has managed to attract corporate support for the schools ( in part by joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater and the local public television station ) . He has also come under increasing criticism from parents . They argue that the gains in scores by lesser-achieving minority children have been at the expense of other students . In particular , these parents complained of a lack of choice in the schools to which they could send their children . This unrest resulted in three of four insurgent candidates winning seats on the seven-member school board this year , almost toppling Dr. Green ' s majority support. // Dr. Green labeled the criticisms as selfish . " We ' d have had a helluva a time in World War II if we ' d waited for everyone to buy in to make a decision about whether they were going to defend a thing called freedom , " he told The Star Tribune , the Newspaper of the Twin Cities . " We ' ve had a helluva a time waiting for the buy in ; ' gim me , gim me , gim me , and then I ' ll buy in . ' For a democracy to work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual choices for the more common good. " //
