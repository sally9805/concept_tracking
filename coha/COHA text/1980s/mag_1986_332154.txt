Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards , no stranger to the gambling tables , took the risky course of allowing his second trial on racketeering and fraud charges to go to the jury without presenting a defense . On Saturday afternoon the Governor won big . The jury found Edwards and four other defendants innocent of all charges , which were connected to a hospital-investment scheme that had netted the flamboyant Governor $1.9 million between his second and third terms . Said a jubilant Edwards : " I feel vindicated. "
