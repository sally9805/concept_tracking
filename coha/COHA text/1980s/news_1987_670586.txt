According to caterers nationwide , business has never been better . More corporations have come to regard entertaining as a useful business tool . More people , too , are chained to the office and want meals delivered . Although the vagaries of the stock market may change some habits , people have been spending freely on parties , making catering a likely option. // As the demand for service has increased , so have the number of purveyors . Everybody caters now : restaurants , delicatessens , supermarkets , even hospitals like Dominican Santa Cruz Hospital in Santa Cruz , Calif . It is an easy business to enter ; you can even rent a kitchen if you don ' t have one. // " If you look in the Yellow Pages , you ' ll see that there are more caterers than there are hairs on your head , " said Mark Gallagher , owner of the Concord Caterer in Winchester , Mass. , near Boston . " A lot of them are illegal businesses run out of somebody ' s house. " // According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those not associated with restaurants , supermarkets and the like - are expected to total $1. 5 billion this year , an increase of 6. 1 percent over last year. // Even New Yorkers , who have always been able to get most things delivered , are creating a bull market for caterers . " This year , business exploded , " said Donald Beckwith , a partner for 12 years in Remember Basil . Recently , he ran into 15 other caterers at a wine promotion . " Everyone is doing more business , " he said . " They were all smiling . They were all wearing nice clothes . " Mr. Beckwith attributes this burst in business to more lavish spending on personal parties like weddings , bar mitzvahs and birthdays , and to an increase in corporate entertaining . " Before , maybe people did business through the mail , " he said . " Now , they do business at parties . " <> <> Sean Driscoll , a partner in Glorious // Food in Manhattan , said that entertaining to improve a company ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to continue despite the volatile stock market . " Some luxuries will be cut , " he said , " but there will still be entertaining. " // Indeed , on Monday , Oct. 19 , the day the market took its most precipitous fall , Susan Simon , a caterer , was asked by a brokerage house to stage a tea party two days later , complete with cucumber and mint sandwiches , lemon curd tartlets , cheese sticks and shortbread. // Michael Roman , a catering consultant in Chicago who is president of the National Institute for Off Premise Catering , said caterers will probably benefit when businesses see the effect of the new tax law , which makes it harder to claim meals as a business expense and limits restaurant-meal deductions to 80 percent of the cost. // Mr. Roman believes that caterers will gain business because meals served in the office may be easier to justify during an audit. // More immediately , Mr. Roman said , the catering business is being changed by customers ' fears that acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be transmitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Roman said that caterers are looking at the way they handle food in an effort to reassure their customers . " White gloves are coming back so that hands aren ' t touching food , " he said. // Caterers say that the biggest growth in the industry has come from providing meals to businesses , often for working lunches . Carlyn Berghoff , a Chicago caterer , said that almost every day , lunch - perhaps steak salad or raspberry chicken - is ordered for about 20 employees and customers at the Xerox Corporation. // " Time is too valuable to pull people away to go to a restaurant , " Ms. Berghoff said . Fisher &; Levy , a caterer in midtown Manhattan , is closing its retail shop to concentrate on lunchtime deliveries , which are up almost 50 percent this year. // " Why should a Park Avenue lawyer who eats well at home or goes to top restaurants at dinner eat garbagage at lunch ? " said Chip Fisher , one of the owners . Executives eat in the office to save time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When New Yorkers see two people talking , they assume they ' re making a deal , " Mr. Fisher said. // Private catering is up , too , and as it becomes more common , it becomes less intimidating . Molly Siple , a New York caterer , recently prepared a buffet dinner for 150 guests ; it was for two men who wanted to celebrate their 12-year-old relationship . " They had never used a caterer before , " she said. // Most caterers are vague about how they set prices , noting only that larger parties are less expensive per person than smaller parties , because cooking for 50 is not much more work than cooking for 10 . The costs depend on various factors , including the menu chosen and the equipment used. // Caterers in many cities say their customers want good , solid food , not what one called " little pretty things. " // People are also more open to ethnic foods , like Thai and Indian dishes . At elegant dinners in New York , veal seems to be the dish of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken hash , are also popular ; Mr. Driscoll at Glorious Food calls the style " nouvelle grandma. " // Holly Safford , of the Catered Affair in North Scituate , Mass. , said people " expect that caterers should provide food equal to that found in the best restaurants , even though we may be working in a tent or from the back of the truck. " // Increasingly , too , patrons want more than food : they want events , with waiters in costumes and food presented dramatically or thematically . Ronnie Davis , owner of Washington Street Cafe Caterers in New York , will supply 12 Count Draculas at a party this week for Marschalk Inc. , which will also have a buffet using dead flowers , tarnished silver and black plates . Special events are becoming more common , Mr. Davis said , because " people are bombarded with life styles of the rich and famous ; they will take their wedding party on a yacht because Christie Brinkley did it. " // In the corporate world , creating a business persona through food can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new building on Fifth Avenue , which is owned and managed by Manhattan Equities Inc . , Mr. Davis recently organized a lunch he described as " elegant but not lavish. " // " That is their image , " he said , referring to Manhattan Equities. // " They are not cheap , but they don ' t waste money . We ' re not using chairs that rent for $7 ; we ' re using $3. 50 chairs . " Even the food was sophisticated but simple : poached chicken with a walnut dressing rather than something more elaborate , like quail in wine sauce. // Catering today can mean just about anything , from breakfast for 2 to dinner for 2 , 000 , held in a home or a museum , or on a boat . Eric Karpeles , a painter and a cook , occasionally serves dinner in his backyard or the dining room of his farmhouse to customers staying at the nearby Tyler Hill ( Pa . ) Bed and Breakfast . " People from the city are always looking for a nice meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat around here . " Sascha Wolhandler , a partner in Sascha Gourmet Catering in Baltimore , said unusual spaces are more popular than ever . She recently catered a party for Scan , a design firm , that started on a boat cruising the Potomac . After the guests disembarked they boarded a bus for their dessert and Cognac course , which they consumed while watching the nighttime glow of Washington. // Ms. Wolhandler ' s most unusual assignment might have been the New Year ' s Eve party for a nudist group that was held in a trailer park. // But even under more ordinary circumstances , catering can be an adventure . Jon Gilman of Taste Caterers in New York , recalled a dinner party in someone ' s home. // " We were doing a pheasant consomme en croute , " he said .
