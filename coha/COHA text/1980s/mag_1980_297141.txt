Composed of a businessman , a political pro and a Senator <P> To run three of the Federal Government 's sprawling , complicated and unglamorous departments , Reagan picked a steer-roping businessman , a party operative and a Senator who was once his vice-presidential choice . The nuts-and-bolts trio : <P> <P> A Cowboy at Commerce <P> On the professional rodeo circuit he is known as Mac Baldrige , a steer roper who finishes in the money about a third of the time ( for $1,605 in prizes last year ) . To the uninitiated he is Malcolm Baldrige , chairman of Scovill Inc. , a power in Connecticut Republican affairs and a close friend of Vice President-elect George Bush 's . As Ronald Reagan 's choice for Secretary of Commerce , Baldrige will bring to Washington -a proven capacity for managing , along with the practice lasso he keeps by his desk . <P> Despite his slow Western drawl , Baldrige , 58 , son of a Nebraska Congressman , embodies the Eastern Establishment that many Reagan backers distrust . He is a graduate of Hotchkiss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Letitia Baldrige , who was Jacqueline Kennedy 's White House social secretary . <P> After 3 years in the Army , where he rose to the rank of captain , Baldrige went to work as a shop foreman in an ironworks , rising through the ranks to become president . He joined Scovill in 1962 , and is credited with changing the company from a stodgy brass manufacturer with sales of $164 million to a conglomerate that now has sales of about $1 billion in goods ranging from appliances and building products to locks and zippers . <P> Lean ( 6 ft. 1 in. , 175 Ibs. ) and handsome as a cigarette-ad cowboy , Baldrige lives with his wife Margaret , the first woman member of the local volunteer fire department , on a rambling estate in Woodbury . The couple have two grown daughters . Baldrige first began riding at age seven in Nebraska . He took up steer roping in the 1950s , turned professional in the late ' 60s , and now competes in an average of eight rodeos a year . " I just plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the timing , the coordination , the partnership with a good horse , the excitement of it . " <P> At Commerce , a collection of trade and technology agencies , with 48,170 employees and a 1981 fiscal budget of $2.8 billion , Baldrige 's major excitement may be the challenge of bettering foreign trade . Said the Secretary-designate last week : " We are going to put a lot of emphasis on exports , productivity and getting rid of some unnecessary regulations that are smothering our job growth . " <P> <P> An Ex-Liberal for HHS <P> So impressed was Richard Schultz Schweiker when Ronald Reagan asked him to be his vice-presidential running mate in 1976 that the Pennsylvania Senator saved and later framed the airline ticket that brought him to California for their momentous meeting . Reagan 's attempt to wrest the party 's presidential nomination from Gerald Ford by prematurely naming the liberal Schweiker to his ticket failed , of course , but it left an indelible mark on Schweiker . Since then he has grown steadily more conservative . Now Reagan has given Schweiker , 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Secretary of Health and Human Services .
