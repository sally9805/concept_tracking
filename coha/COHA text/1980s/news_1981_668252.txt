The Communications Workers of America ( CWA ) convention here last week was a portender of labor conventions to come - a sounding board for Democrats to blast President Ronald Reagan ' s administration and his economic plan . In itself that isn ' t new . Labor has used its conventions to rebuke Presidents of the United States before . But what is new is that the Reagan Administration has no one close enough to labor to personally salve and rebut the criticism . In the past , particularly during Republican administrations , this mediating job has fallen on the shoulders of the Secretary of Labor . Perhaps the most successful was James Mitchell , a New York retail store management official before being named Secretary of Labor by President Dwight D. Eisenhower . President Eisenhower was in much the same position as President Reagan - both defeated Democrats with the aid of rank-and-file workers . Yet , Reagan has no Mitchell in his cabinet . Instead he has a former contracting officialfrom New Jersey by the name of Raymond J. Donovan . While Mitchell began his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized labor , Donovan began by slamming the door . Mitchell could turn aside criticism with a smile and answer with a logical , if low key , argument . He was a negotiator , on the wrong side of the table so far as labor was concerned , but he was appreciated nonetheless . He was also effective , from President Eisenhower ' s political stance . Donovan , unfortunately for the Reagan Administration , is not . Although AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland claims Donovan assured organized labor he would be in close consultation before the Labor Department initiated any drastic changes , that hasn ' t been the case . As one national union leader put it : " Donovan is set upon stripping the department bare and there is no tease involved . " Donovan has spent most of his assignments talking not to labor but to management . Yet in some management quarters there is beginning to evolve criticism of Donovan that his actions may forecast industrial strife in the near future . While President Reagan is under fire for not having a foreign policy , Donovan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates were told this past week that labor and management must cooperate in the future if this nation is to compete with Japan , France , Belgium and Switzerland in the years ahead . But it wasn ' t the nation ' s Secretary of Labor making the statement . It was Sen. Paul Tsongas , a Democrat from Lowell . Next year , the nation goes into one of its most critical collective- bargaini ng sessions in the past two decades . What is Donovan doing to pave the way ? If anyone knows , including Donovan , it is one of the nation ' s best kept secrets . Meanwhile , the Democrats are going to make the most of the vacuum . While they had a field day at the CWA convention with the Reagan Administration , Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , Sen. Tsongas and Kirkland have just begun the battle . And without a James Mitchell as Secretary of Labor , the Reagan Administration has no antidote .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
