The men who are rebuilding North Michigan Avenue will soon change the way we look at our skyline , but already this summer they have changed the way we look at ourselves . Men in hardhats and sleeveless T-shirts , their work boots dulled by dust and concrete , their forearms darkened by the green ink of tatoo artists , have appeared in force this summer , bold and swaggering participants in one of the biggest Michigan Avenue building booms since the 1920s . To the street of important stores , elegant residents , wealthy tourists and captains of commerce , a dissonant element has been added , transforming the Miracle Mile into something quite new and not unexciting . Yet the men who are rebuilding North Michigan Avenue sense that many of the people who regularly traverse the street regard the new presence less than charitably . " The suits " is how several of the construction workers describe the disdainful passersby . " They look maybe afraid of me or something , " observed Doug Mika , 42 , an ironworker employed in the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue and " 80 Exceptional Shops " will open next year . " I don ' t know what these people must think of construction workers . " " Animals , " suggested John Schulget , 21 , a partner of Mika ' s . " Yeah , like they ' re so uppity , looking down on us . But when they can ' t fix their car or something goes wrong in their house , who do they call ? A guy like me , " Mika boasted . " Otherwise , they don ' t say nothing to you . " Troy McKnight , 25 , a carpenter from the South Side , has noted that the very buildings he has helped build are now the offices and playgrounds of these same people . " Those people shopping at Bloomingdale ' s might think they ' re uppity , look down on a guy like me , but I built that bad building , " said McKnight . " I built it . " In McKnight ' s fantasy , however , the occasional sneer is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a choking feeling that they , and not us , are doing the real work of the republic . " They glare at us , then go back to their offices and stand there looking out their windows to watch us working , " said McKnight . " We don ' t look out no window at them. " - - - It would be an exaggeration to say that each of the men rebuilding North Michigan Avenue is preoccupied with the women who pass their work sites , but hardly . A man employed as an ironworker on City Place said that the catcalling had gotten so bad that James McHugh Construction Co. , a general contractor on the project , recently issued a memo to its workers instructing them to restrict their expressions of approval . David Olszak , the McHugh executive directing the City Place project , said he was not aware of a written order , but that admonishments were not uncommon , a result of complaints by proprietors of the many important Michigan Avenue stores . " This is a common problem , " Olszak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what more can we do ? " What , indeed . " Jesus , save my soul , " is how carpenter McKnight put it one recent noon-hour in appreciation of a woman in shorts and a lively pink shirt . Had the woman paused , which she didn ' t , McKnight said he would have offered " not a line so much as a greeting . How you doing beautiful woman ? ' " he demonstrated . " Would you like a bite of pizza ? " ' James Anderson , 20 , an electrician sharing lunch with McKnight outside the construction site , said he was particularly admiring of one woman who walked by daily- " the usual , " he called her-but did not know how to advance their relationship , which was grounded at the mutual smiling stage . McKnight said that the women of Michigan Avenue , accustomed to male colleagues of faultless wardrobes , seemed put off by the " dirty and dusty " look of construction workers . But Vince Lewandowski , 26 , who is working on elevator construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came by once and said , Here , you want some popcorn ? ' I said , sure . She said , I just like redheads . ' But she looked like a waitress . She wasn ' t like a stockbroker or anything. " - - - Lewandowski , wearing blue jeans and a shirt emblazoned with a blue parrot , said that when the construction project is finished he would like to bring his girlfriend , a waitress , to visit the stores and dine in the restaurants and take some photographs of the building he is helping build . He believes , however , that construction workers are not the sort of patrons the developers wish to attract , a result of an experience he had during construction of a building at Franklin and Monroe Streets . " Once they got the first tenants in there , they wouldn ' t let us walk through the front door any more , " he said . " That ' s okay , " he added . " I never shop on Michigan Avenue anyway . " Garrett Stencel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that when the building is complete , he will come by with his wife and take photographs , but nothing else . " I ' m a J.C. Penney and Ward ' s man , " he said early Monday morning as he stood in front of City Place , directing cement trucks onto the construction site that will one day house Saks and Gucci . Such stores are not the attraction for Stencel . " What guy wouldn ' t like to get up there and start flexing his muscles like the ironworkers , right there in front of everyone ?
