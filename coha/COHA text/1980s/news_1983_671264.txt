Some artists ' books have already a classic status in their field . We remember , for instance , the ones that Ed Ruscha began to publish in Los Angeles in the 1960 ' s , with their wonderfully offhand and unseductive titles and their no less offhand subject matter . We also remember the books in which the English sculptor Richard Long recorded his walks in one part of the world or another , and the book in which Sol LeWitt made a photographic inventory of every single object in his house and turned the end result into a form of wordless autobiography. // In the domain of general publishing we should take a look at the output of the Limited Editions Club , lately rejuvenated by its new publisher , Sidney Shiff , and his son Benjamin . Other signals abound - among them the productions of the Jargon Society , a small publishing house that operates out of Highlands , North Carolina , and the forthcoming appearance from Vincent Fitz Gerald &; Company of Dame Edith Sitwell ' s " The Death of Venus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international . One of the most distinguished books of our time is the edition of Samuel Beckett ' s " Fizzles , " with illustrations by Jasper Johns , which was made mostly in Paris , published by the Petersburg Press in London , and is the work of an Irish writer and an American artist . Enthusiasts also remember the edition of the poems of Jules Laforgue with illustrations by Patrick Caulfield , which came out from Waddington Galleries in London in the 1970 ' s , and they look forward to the edition of Dante ' s " Divine Comedy " ( another Waddington publication ) in which the English painter Tom Phillips has made not only the illustrations but a complete new translation to go with them . There , if ever , is an enterprise that rates an A for ambition. // The artist ' s book can also function as sculpture . This is true above all of the huge tarblack books in which private images have been not so much bound up as entombed by the German painter Anselm Kiefer . But it could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesco Clemente in India , which looks as if it had been printed with vegetable juices on dried leaves from an anonymous and very large tree . There is really no limit to the potential of the " artist ' s book. " // // But whereas the artist ' s book is addressed primarily to the public for high art , the Limited Editions Club books are addressed to that broad general public that can afford to spend $100 or $120 on an illustrated book of superfine quality that it will want to read and look at forever . The charm of the L. E. C. books is twofold , in that context. // To begin with , there is the look of the printed page . Invaluable as the trade paperback may be , its page has usually a sad and stunted look by comparison with a page on which the right print has been set by hand on the right paper with the right-sized margins and a sufficiency of air between the lines. // The recent L. E. C. edition of Seamus Heaney ' s poems is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the L. . C. page has the effect of a charge of oxygen on lungs long deprived of it . The same kind of care goes into every detail of the production . When I found out that G " unter Grass ' s " The Flounder " was to be bound in a combination of grey Polish linen and eel leather ( brought for the purpose from South Korea ) , I felt that a sacred frenzy was somewhere doing its work. // It is L. . C. policy that author and artist are equal partners . But as the Club works primarily with texts that are already hallowed - examples now in the planning stage include " All The King ' s Men " by Robert Penn Warren , " Dubliners " by James Joyce and " The Captive Mind " by C.W. Milosz - it is the images that provide the element of novelty. // In an earlier generation Picasso agreed to illustrate " Lysistrata " of Aristophanes for the Limited Editions Club , and Matisse took on James Joyce ' s " Ulysses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Matisse ' s " Ulysses " is long on Dublin detail . The Shiff regime has had some snappy ideas , too - notably the choice of Sol LeWitt for " Ficciones " by Jorge Luis Borges , and of Jacob Lawrence for John Hersey ' s " Hiroshima. " // The problem in such a case is to make an image that will relate to the text without seeming to dictate our responses to it . Jacob Lawrence manages to portray a world split open and a population subjected to indignities for which there had been no precedent . Sol LeWitt has devised a graphic equivalent for the tiny and intricate verbal constructions of Borges . In neither case does the word " illustration " have the pejorative implication that it sometimes carries with it . The same could be said of what William Bailey is doing for Willa Cather ' s " A Lost Lady , " and what Larry Rivers is doing for " The Magician of Lublin " by Isaac Bashevis Singer , and what Romare Bearden did this year for the poems of Derek Walcott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 200 for 10 such books is likely to think the money well spent. // // Altogether , there is something self-evidently right about the resuscitation of the illustrated book . It corresponds to one of our earliest and most lasting satisfactions . The child is rare , odd and much underprivileged who does not learn to read from picture books . A Victorian prodigy like John Stuart Mill or Thomas Babington Macaulay might reach out with his tiny paw for Sophocles in the original Greek , but for the rest of us reading began with books of a relatively rudimentary sort in which pictures helped the words along. // And then , around the time we left high school , the picture book turned into the illustrated book . Once again the pictures made lighter work of the text . Wherever we looked , we stayed to read . Classics that we might have shut in despair stayed open . Action that was beyond our experience was made clear to us . The illustrators set standards , moreover , at a time when we could not yet set them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we loved them . But when we turned 21 , if not before , we decided that the act of reading was not only sacred but self-sufficient , and we snorted at the idea that someone might presume to come between us and the text . Illustrated classics were hick stuff - or so it seemed then - and if we saw someone reading one in the train we looked down our noses. // The illustrated book was often thought of at that time among intellectuals as a discredited survivor of the bad old days when even the great novelists were believed to need some form of visual back-up . What was illustration , if not by definition an inferior and subordinate activity ? Quite apart from that , illustrations dated in a way that great poetry and the great novel did not . Even the masterpieces of French 18th-century illustration could seem insufficient when the reader settled in with the timeless texts of Racine and Moli ere that had prompted them. // What few people knew at that time was that the illustrated book had played an important role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all - monumental illustrated editions of the major writers . Bonnard ' s illustrations to Paul Verlaine ' s " Parall element " stand out to this day as one of his major achievements . Nothing in the voluminous output of Chagall outshines his illustrations to Gogol ' s " Dead Souls . " Derain ' s Rabelais and Matisse ' s Ronsard are monuments in their kind . To turn the pages of these books is to witness the mating of word and image in some of its highest and happiest manifestations. // But the illustrated book in the 20th century has not been simply a subdepartment of luxury . When D.-H . Kahnweiler in Paris in 1901 published Guillaume Apollinaire in book form for the first time and got Andre Derain to make some illustrations , he didn ' t go in for fancy binding or expensive paper . But the book - " L ' Enchanteur Pourrissant " - is one of the most famous things of its kind. // // In post-revolutionary Russia it was put together with whatever bits and pieces of paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pay a call on Ex Libris , the bookstore at 160A East 70th Street . ) The books published by the Bauhaus in Germany were anything but ostentatious . When Vanessa Bell illustrated her sister Virginia Woolf for the Hogarth Press , the result looked what it was - homemade - even if it is worth a great deal of money now . The illustrated books that Ed Ruscha began to publish in Los Angeles in the 1960 ' s were anything but luxurious. // So you don ' t have to spend a fortune even today to publish ( or to buy ) a book that will make history . All you need is the right idea , and the right people to carry it out , and just a touch - indispensable , this - of the sacred frenzy. // //
