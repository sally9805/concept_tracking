It keeps humming so that he can keep running <P> When Ronald Reagan arrived in Hollywood in 1937 , he had only a few dollars in his pocket and a $200-a-week contract with Warner Bros . In the course of making more than 50 films , Reagan earned and spent a lot of money , but ended up with relatively little saved . Yet today the presumptive G.O.P. presidential nominee is a millionaire , with a net worth of at least $2 million and possibly as much as $4 million . <P> The figure is imprecise because Reagan has shrouded his personal finances in considerable secrecy . Attempts to force him to disclose the details of his holdings have encountered such tough resistance that he has been sued by the Federal Election Commission and a similar California agency . Reagan is by no means unique in his desire to keep his personal finances confidential , and it may simply reflect his strong feelings about privacy . More important , there has been no hint of any dishonesty or illegality in his financial dealings . But his adamant refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich he really is and how he got that way . <P> Reagan has fairly simple tastes , but his affluence provides handsome rewards for his wife Nancy . She wears $5,000 designer dresses , collects fine jewelry , paintings and antiques and keeps her hairdresser and an interior decorator on call . Reagan , by contrast , has to be prodded into buying a new suit , prefers outdoor barbecues to haute cuisine and drives a worn 1969 red Ford station wagon , a 1976 Monarch sedan and a decade-old Jeep . He carries little cash , usually only a few bills carefully folded into a money clip in his pocket . In fact , he once flew to Paris with only $5 and was annoyed when he had to use that to tip someone . <P> Reagan 's residences , while very comfortable , are not lavish by Southern California standards . He and Nancy live in a spacious nine-room house in Pacific Palisades , an exclusive Los Angeles enclave . For weekends they have Rancho del Cielo , their 667-acre spread near Santa Barbara , complete with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such amenities in his early days in Hollywood . He appeared in about 20 minor movies before he won his big break in 1940 as the Notre Dame football hero George Gipp in the hit Knute Rockne-All American . That brought Reagan stardom , and the following year , when he played in King 's Row , Warner 's tripled his salary to $600 a week , a substantial sum in those Depression-ridden days . He celebrated by moving into a large apartment and buying a Cadillac convertible . He also fell behind in paying his income taxes . Pearl Harbor cut off Reagan 's fat paychecks . As an Army Air Corps officer , he remained in Hollywood narrating training films for the Air Corps , earning only $2,400 a year as a first lieutenant and then $2,760 as a captain . When the war ended , the IRS began dunning him for his unpaid taxes . Reagan maintains , however , that he thought these taxes would be forgiven for soldiers as they had been in World War I.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
