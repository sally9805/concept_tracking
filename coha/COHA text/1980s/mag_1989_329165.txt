B. Altman and Bonwit Teller are not the sort of stores that stiff their suppliers . But since the spring , several fashion houses have withheld shipments to the swank Manhattan department stores because of late payments . The stores have been caught in the enormous debt problems of their current owner , Australia 's Hooker Corp. , which is controlled by investor George Herscu . Last week Hooker 's U.S. holding company sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy . <P> Herscu piled up debts of $1.4 billion building his trans-Pacific empire , then ran into trouble last year . Hooker , Australia 's second largest home builder , has been hit by rising interest rates and sagging home sales in Australia , as well as lukewarm retail sales in the U.S. Herscu is now trying to sell off $750 million in assets , from Manhattan to Melbourne . Altman and Bonwit , meanwhile , are hoping to satisfy their creditors in time to sell some fall fashions.                  @ @ @
