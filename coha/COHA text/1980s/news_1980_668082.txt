The beginning of The Second Season was different from the beginning of The First Season because of the number of runs . But the result was the same . The First Season had begun with a 9-5 loss in County Stadium on April 10 . Last night , opening what promises to be the longest second half in years , the Red Sox came closer , but they still stumbled at the finish , 2-1 . This time , a superb pitching duel between Reborn Reggie Cleveland and Mike Torrez - one with a half-dozen outstanding defensive plays - was decided in the eighth by a walk and a double-play ball that Torrez couldn ' t field . So the Brewers , leaders of the second-place pack , plucked off the victory on Gorman Thomas ' game-winning single and took the opener of last night ' s doubleheader . Cleveland , who is 4-1 , 1.85 since moving into the starting rotation on June 16 , got some defensive help from two superb catches in right-center . " It ' s the same thing , " said Reggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and attitude around , and the ability was always there . That ' s what the Red Sox traded for . Tonight I had breaks , but breaks come when you pitch well . " As did Torrez , who is now 4-9 . He pitched well . He also was helped by two outstanding replays started by Jimmy Dwyer - one in right , one in left - that saved him from allowing earlier runs . But when he walked Don Money with one out in the eighth and Cecil Cooper ' s bouncer through the middle went past him , the game was set for Thomas ' decisive single down the left-field line . The wounded list had another name added . Jerry Remy again jarred his left knee as he stopped while rounding second base in the sixth . " I saw no one was covering third , stopped to get back and felt it pop , " said Remy . " I won ' t know until I see how stiff it is ( today ) , but I don ' t think it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in May , Remy was out eight days . The last two starts had been tough ones for Torrez , who had lasted a total of only seven innings against the Orioles . But last night he came out , overcame his early-inning bugaboos - mon dieu , he even had a no-hitter two outs into the fourth - and gave the Red Sox the kind of start they had to have . They entered the game with just 21 healthy players ( 19 were usable , since they couldn ' t employ second-game starter Steve Renko or tonight ' s starter , Dennis Eckersley ) , and even that number soon would shrink . However , old friend Cleveland was pitching every bit as well . He was nicked for a run in the second when Carlton Fisk , who isn ' t swinging the bat well but is getting hits , looped a single into left , stole second and scored when Dave Stapleton roped a two-out double into the left-field corner . For a guy without big power , Stapleton ' s extra-base hit ration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra bases . However , that was the only one of the three one-out stolen bases in the first four innings that produced anything . Remy and Fisk ( after his second steal on a pitchout ) were left stranded on the other two . After Stapleton ' s double in the second , the Red Sox had one other hit , Fisk ' s bunt in the fourth , off Cleveland through the seventh . By then , it was 1-1 and the the Red Sox had lost yet another player . In the sixth , Remy twisted his left knee , the same one he injured last July and has popped out a couple of times this season , rounding second base trying to get back . He was examined by Milwaukee team physician Dr. Paul Jacobs , who reported that it was nothing serious . However , for this doubleheader with one of the league ' s best teams , Don Zimmer was left with no more than 18 bodies , two of them ( Fred Lynn , Dwyer ) limping . Out of the regular lineup were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poquette , and Chuck Rainey , Tom Burgmeier and Skip Lockwood were all gone from the pitching staff . Torrez had his no-hitter until Cooper slapped a single through the hole on the right side with two outs in the fourth . He had his shutout until the fifth . Ben Oglivie had singled to lead off , then moved up on Sixto Lezcano ' s fly ball that Stapleton hauled down on the warning track . Dick Davis then hit a routine two-hopper to short , but Oglivie made the bonehead play of running , only to have the Red Sox reciprocate the poor baseball by mishandling the rundown and allowing Oglivie to stay alive longer , enabling Davis to get to second base . Jim Gantner promptly dumped a single into left-center for the run to make the messed-up rundown seem even worse . Charlie Moore made it seem less important when he rifled the next pitch into the right-field corner for what appeared to be the go-ahead run , but Remy made a perfect relay and Fisk made one heckuva tag diving into Gantner ' s slide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of another jam when Thomas doubled to left- center with Money on second and two outs in the sixth . Torrez walked Oglivie intentionally to pitch to Lezcano , a move made on Opening Day preceding Lezcano ' s game- winning grand slam . But this time , Lezcano tapped to Rick Burleson , and it worked . As well as Cleveland was pitching - and Stapleton ' s double was the only one of the three hits that was hit hard - he was also helped by some outstanding defensive plays . Thomas made two tough running catches on Dwyer in the second to prevent a big inning , and robbed Dwight Evans in the eighth . Money made two tough plays coming in on topped rollers , then went across the line to rob Burleson of a double in the eighth . Finally , in the bottom of the eighth , Torrez found a way to hurt himself . First , he walked Money with one out . Then , when Cooper hit what should have been a routine double-play bouncer to the box , Torrez couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center and there were runners at first and second . Thomas nailed the first pitch inside the third-base bag down the left- field line to score pinch runner Ed Romero for the go-ahead run .
