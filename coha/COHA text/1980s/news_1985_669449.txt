The Pentagon has long pushed for wider authority to administer lie-detector tests to employees as a means of supplementing background security checks . They would be aimed at helping to expose Soviet and other ' ' moles ' ' in the government. // In the past , Congress has been reluctant to grant the Pentagon such broad authority . This is partly out of concern that the careers and constitutional rights of loyal government employees may be jeopardized by a machine that has not been scientifically proved to be 100 percent accurate . ( Polygraph results are inadmissible as evidence in US federal courts. ) // // Defense officials say polygraphs have a 75 to 90 percent accuracy rate . Some critics stress , however , that even with a 90 percent accuracy rate , 1 out of every 10 people who take the test runs the risk of being wrongly identified as a security threat. // If the polygraphs were administered to about 450 , 000 Navy personnel , as Secretary Lehman proposes , roughly 45 , 000 people could come under suspicion - falsely. // Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake of potential damage done to United States national security by the alleged spy ring headed by John A. Walker Jr. , say observers in Congress. // On Friday , Sen. Phil Gramm ( R ) of Texas introduced a bill with a provision that would grant authority to the Pentagon to conduct random counterintelligence polygraph screening for virtually everyone with a Defense Department security clearance . Currently some 4. 3 million people hold such clearances. // But congressional critics of the Pentagon ' s polygraph plans are concerned that defense officials may use the current wave of public indignation over the Walker spy case to gain a freer hand to administer polygraph tests. // ' ' They ( Pentagon officials ) have the ability to get a major polygraph screening program installed for the first time , ' ' says a congressional aide . ' ' This is a major blow to our efforts. ' ' // In the past some members of Congress have viewed such tests as ' ' fishing expeditions ' ' aimed more at plugging leaks to the news media than at catching Soviet spies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a former Navy communications specialist was apparently able for 20 years to assemble a network of family and friends to help him spy and that naval counterintelligence was unable to detect it , a new case is being made for the importance of polygraphs as an adjunct to more traditional counterintelligence methods. // Some observers say they believe that Walker would have been either deterred or detected much sooner had the Navy maintained a more rigorous system of background security checks and random counterintelligence polygraph exams. // ' ' We believe that the polygraph is a valid investigative tool in connection with our overall personnel security program , ' ' says retired Gen. Richard G. Stilwell , former deputy undersecretary for defense policy . General Stilwell , who has been the Pentagon ' s most vocal advocate for wider use of polygraphs , was recently appointed to head a Pentagon commission to evaluate Defense Department security procedures with special attention to the Walker case. // Under a congressionally approved pilot program , the Pentagon currently has authority to carry out 3 , 500 counterintelligence screenings . The screenings are confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ' s most sensitive secrets. // The results of the screenings were to be presented in December in a report to Congress prior to a final decision on whether to permit wider use of the polygraph . But the sense of urgency created by the Walker case may cause Congress to take up the issue sooner. // In response to the case , Navy Secretary John F. Lehman last week announced a proposed plan that would eventually require everyone in the Navy holding a security clearance - even relatively low-level ' ' classified ' ' clearances - to submit to random polygraph tests. // At present there are 900 , 000 Navy personnel with security clearances of some kind . Under the Lehman proposal , that number would be reduced by half , meaning that some 450 , 000 Navy personnel would ultimately face random polygraph tests. // The Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency require extensive polygraph exams as a condition of employment . Intelligence officials have observed that while the producers of intelligence information at the CIA and NSA must take polygraphs , the consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not had to . The Pentagon would like to eliminate the discrepancy , establishing a more uniform system of security checks for all government workers with access to sensitive information. // Rep. Jack Brooks ( D ) of Texas , chairman of the House Government Operations Committee , sees the Pentagon ' s efforts as a dangerous precedent. // ' ' The Department of Defense ' s push for increased polygraph use is a quick fix , and it will in all likelihood backfire , ' ' he says . ' ' The fact is that polygraph screening has no scientific basis. ' ' // Pentagon officials have stressed that action against an individual wouldn ' t be taken solely on the basis of the results of a polygraph exam . They add that exam results would not be included in personnel files. // But others suggest that once suspicion is aroused about an individual working in a highly sensitive area , it can have a profoundly adverse impact on a career. // Several members of Congress are concerned that the Defense Department may become too reliant and trusting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extensive background checks. // Critics of the Pentagon ' s position say that all major studies of polygraph accuracy are based on exams given in the course of specific criminal investigations . They note that there is no reliable measure of the accuracy of polygraphs in conducting counterintelligence screenings. // //
