Geneticist Barb McClintock , ignored for years , wins a Nobel <P> There was no morning call from Stockholm ; Barbara McClintock does not have a phone . Instead , the 81-year-old geneticist learned the news by radio . " Oh , dear , " she is said to have murmured . And having pronounced that judgment , the diminutive ( 5-ft. , 100-lb. ) scientist donned her usual attire-baggy dungarees , a man-tailored shirt and sturdy oxfords-and stepped out for her usual morning walk through the woods near Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island . As usual , she gathered walnuts along the way . Winning the Nobel Prize for Medicine seemed no reason to alter her schedule . <P> That understated response to the greatest honor in science was typical of the intensely private , no-nonsense researcher . Genetics is a science founded by a monk-19th century Augustinian Gregor Mendel-and McClintock is in every sense his disciple . For half a century she has labored in almost monastic solitude over her patch of Indian corn , or maize , much as Mendel did in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is done by large research teams , McClintock did not even have a laboratory assistant . ( " Excuse me for being hoarse , " she once told a scientist who stopped by her lab at 5 p.m. , " but I have not yet used my vocal cords today . " ) Also , like Mendel , McClintock received little attention for her efforts throughout most of her career . Her principal discovery was both complex and heretical : genes , she claimed , are not fixed on the chromosome like so many pearls on a string ; they can move around in an unpredictable fashion . The trouble was that she announced this back in 1951 , and as one Nobel committee member noted last week , " only about five geneticists in the world could appreciate it . " <P> The world has finally begun to catch up with " Barb " McClintock . The Nobel Prize Committee hailed her once obscure work as " one of the two great discoveries of our times in genetics , " the other being the 1953 discovery , by James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA . In 82 years of Nobel history , just six other women have won honors in scientific categories ; and only two of these were named alone , without fellow honorees : France 's Marie Curie in 1911 , for discovering radium and polonium , and Britain 's Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1964 , for deciphering the structure of penicillin and other compounds . McClintock is the first to win unshared honors in medicine and physiology . Said Watson , who has been director at Cold Spring Harbor and hence McClintock 's boss for 15 years : " It is not a controversial award . No one thinks of genetics now without the implications of her work . " <P>
