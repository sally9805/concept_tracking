COLONEL SHEDMAN All right , mine , too ! But I did think they 'd be better off in the wide open spaces . Which are deaf , dumb and blind . DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Kansas was n't so bad , you know . I was born there . p. 35 PIXIE ( To Bertram . ) Read . BERTRAM ( Reading . ) " Thus did we remove , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a barren and deserted world , a wilderness of flatland and sod and grass and nothing else .

All might have been well , but not in Kansas . " ( Bertram winds the scarf around his neck , leaving one end dangling . ) " Where my savage husband 's good intentions soon collapsed . After the birth of our son , the loneliness of the prairie turned him away from his quiet home to the common solace of drinking and dancing and self-indulgence . I was then most often alone , with only my child for company , and a few well-meaning , but primitive companions . And so , in a culture of savages I tried to live , searching for understanding with whatever friends I could find . " ( Bertram takes some papers from his desk . Scarf dangling , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , looking at a poem of his doubtfully . ) BERTRAM/POET I 'm not so sure about it . p. 36 PIXIE Confidence . That 's what it takes .

" PIXIE Nothing wrong with that . Let me hear the end again . ( Doctor Shedman , walking unsteadily , sees them , and stands watching . ) BERTRAM/POET " Selina Falls Railroad Crash ! How dread the sight , how clean Cut down in death the rash Of widows , mites , from Abilene ! " ( To Pixie , anxiously . ) PIXIE By mites you mean children ? BERTRAM/POET Of course . PIXIE But does n't mite also mean money ? BERTRAM/POET I 'll just say children . PIXIE That 's better . BERTRAM/POET Boy . This writing poetry . PIXIE Confidence . That 's what it takes .

She does . DOCTOR SHEDMAN A poem . ( He looks at her poem in his hand . ) " Hope . " ( He laughs . ) What a title . Well , let 's give it a try . Ahem . " Hope . " ( He reads Pixie 's poem . ) " And now is gone the happy days  --  No more . " Is gone , are gone ? Days , plural , are gone , surely . More than one , and all that . I do n't mean to be pedantic , Kansas Lark , and I could n't agree with the sentiment more , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uplifted head : For bowed in grief , now faith is dead . " Very well . But what is bowed in grief , now faith is dead ? Uplifted head ? This is sentimental hogwash , Pixie . I 'll see my boy now . PIXIE No , you wo n't DOC SHEDMAN , JR .

( Reading . ) " The heart that through the toilsome day Beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife of worldly gain With faith serene , is filled with pain . " Oh , dear me . Pixie filled with pain . No , the heart filled with pain , sorry . After beating through the toilsome day , high with hope . You know , I think it has to be one or the other , but let it pass . It 's strong and sensitive , and of course above the strife of worldly gain , otherwise it would n't be poetic , would it ? DOC SHEDMAN , JR . ( Asleep . ) Mamma ! p. 40 DOCTOR SHEDMAN ( Reading . ) " High winds of stress and low'ring clouds . Obscuring mists  --  " Well , I think I know what you 're talking about there  --  " Through darkness , maze , from crushing blow His hand will hold , give  --  " Wait a minute . His hand ?

" Rain , a-gain . The subtlety of it meets one at every turn . ( He stands looking at her , weaving a little , and smiling . ) Well , let me tell you this . I do sympathize with all this pain you 're in , but we 've been married four years now , and I 'm in a little discomfort myself . Lacking the tongue of the poet , I just go dancing , like any clod , to kill my pain . And , like any clod , I have a drink , or two or three or four , with other clods . One such is a waitress at the Starlight Cafe in Hazleton . You would n't like her . She drinks , too . Not only that , she dances . Worst of all , the little girl 's pregnant . And you know what , Pixie ? Here 's a couplet for you . " She wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's just going to try and blame it on us ! " And you know something else ? I do n't care . Because my little waitress does n't pretend to be something she is n't . She just likes to work , dance , drink and you-know-what . She does n't mope around like Little Eva , and brood around like Lady Macbeth , and make me feel like a goddamned dog with a lot of goddamned doggerel ! p. 41 DOC SHEDMAN , JR . ( Groaning . ) Ah ! Ah ! DOCTOR SHEDMAN Now . If my waitress really is pregnant , she will have my baby , with not one word from you . And if you do n't like it , you can walk back to North Carolina , and write a poem about that ! And now I will see my boy . Get out of my way ! DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Ah ! PIXIE No . DOCTOR SHEDMAN I 've never raised my hand to you , Pixie . PIXIE But you will now ? DOCTOR SHEDMAN Damn right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . covers his face with his hands , groaning . Doctor Shedman goes after Pixie . She avoids him . He catches her by the shoulders , turns her around , and swings his fist at her . She ducks , steps back , and takes from Bertram a large toy pistol . ) DOC SHEDMAN , JR . ( Screaming . ) AHH ! ! ! ! BERTRAM BANG ! ! ! ! ( Pause . ) DOCTOR SHEDMAN That 's my gun . PIXIE Right . DOCTOR SHEDMAN You shot at me . PIXIE Right . p. 42 DOCTOR SHEDMAN But you do n't know how to shoot a gun . PIXIE Right . DOCTOR SHEDMAN You could have killed me . PIXIE And the next time you step drunk into our house , I will . ( She tosses the pistol to him . He catches it . ) Keep it . But try to come between me and my son again , and I will find that gun again and next time put the bullet in your head . DOCTOR SHEDMAN Your son ? DOC SHEDMAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my son , too ! PIXIE Is he ? Critic ? ( Pause . ) DOCTOR SHEDMAN ( Pale . ) What ? PIXIE Silly little poet , am I ? Well , you were pretty fancy yourself , when you married me . You did n't mind hearts full of pain and hope then . Because you were feeling it , it was all right ! By all means have your waitress and your baby , because that baby may be the only baby that 's yours ! DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Ah ! Ah ! DOCTOR SHEDMAN My boy , not mine ? PIXIE Maybe he is , and maybe he is n't ! I do n't know ! I never will know , and neither will you ! Because you were n't so terrifically exact when you pulled me out of your father 's bed one day and threw me into yours the next ! You did n't think about that , then ? Well , think about it now ! p. 43 DOCTOR SHEDMAN Pixie ! DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Mother ! COLONEL SHEDMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIXIE Oh , yes , it can !

BERTRAM No . I was n't . Not in Kansas . DOC SHEDMAN , JR . I never slept well when I was a baby . Nobody knew why . I just could n't . All I remember is , I could n't breathe !

Nothing in my way . I loved it ! ( He is filled , as he remembers his childhood , with a desperate energy . ) I loved it ! At three , I had my first bird dog . At five , I made my own casting rods . At nine , on horseback , with a pistol , I hit a dove in flight . I was Southwest American Rifle Champion for six straight years . When I was thirteen , I killed a mountain lion . Nobody knew how he got to Kansas , or what he was doing there , but he came to me . My first shot broke his shoulder . My second shot broke his spine . He was still alive when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt myself , of course , all the time . Ran into things , fell off horses . Broke both arms . This leg twice .

My little playmates watched me shoot a deer , hang it up by its legs , cut its throat , skin , it , cook it and eat it , and left me pretty much alone . BERTRAM You were free . DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Yes , free ! In Kansas ! BERTRAM With your mother and father . DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Yes . I overheard a man once call my mother a  --  a  --  BERTRAM ( Softly . ) A bitch ? DOC SHEDMAN , JR .

" ( Bertram lowers the Captivity , thinks . ) When he was nine , he got a horse , from his father . ( Doctor Shedman , smiling , goes to Doc Shedman Jr. ) p. 46 DOCTOR SHEDMAN How do you like him ? DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Fine ! DOCTOR SHEDMAN Fast enough for you ? DOC SHEDMAN , JR . Oh yeah ! He runs harder in the afternoon than he does in the morning . DOCTOR SHEDMAN Be careful with him .

For his mother , he grew up becalmed , tractable , noble and civil , considerate in time of his own family , yet the beast was still wild . It was folly to tame him . For a captive himself , trapped in peace , he burned within , consuming himself in fires he could not spread . " BERTRAM Stand aside .
