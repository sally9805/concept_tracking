What if George Gershwin had lived longer ? He saw his first hit song , Swanee , sell more than a million copies , wrote for Broadway and symphony orchestras and performed Rhapsody in Blue to the applause of Rachmaninoff and Stokowski , all before his 30th birthday . He was planning further classical compositions when he died of a brain tumor at the age of 38 in 1937 . Would Gershwin 's later music have made its way into the standard American repertory along with the works of Aaron Copland and Samuel Barber ? Or would he have been considered an overreacher whose notes never quite shook off the reverberations of Tin Pan Alley ? <P> In this amiable study of a man and his epoch , Musicologist Edward Jablonski shows why the queries persist on the 50th anniversary of Gershwin 's death . George 's father , Leatherworker Morris Gershovitz , thought Ira , the oldest of his four children , was the most talented  --  until George , nearly two years younger , appropriated the keyboard with an amalgam of brashness and genius . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets to the clamorous offices of song publishers . Sometimes his talent outstripped his ambition . When he auditioned for a job with Irving Berlin , the composer turned him down with some free advice : " Stick to writing your own songs , kid . " <P> The kid took it to heart . Gershwin 's music reflected an emotional ebullience , but he rarely gave all of himself in private life . He was exceptionally close to his brother ; they shared a house even after Ira 's marriage . But George remained a bachelor whose most valued female friend was the married composer Kay Swift . <P> Gershwin tended to be facile in his attitude toward classical music : " I 'd like to write a quartet some day , " he mused . " But it will be something simple , like Mozart . " Even today , when the rich harmonies of A Foggy Day and The Man I Love have become pop classics and jazz standards , the High Gershwin of Porgy and Bess and Concerto in F finds detractors . They began sounding sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times critic found the concerto 's " instrumentation . . . neither flesh , fowl nor good red herring . " Composer Virgil Thomson wrote , " Gershwin does not even know what an opera is . " <P> The target paid little attention to these professional attacks . Jablonski is particularly illuminating when he shows Gershwin distancing himself from his oeuvre , finding new ways of playing his tunes at parties as if they had been written by someone else . After a rehearsal he exclaimed , " I think the music is so marvelous  --  I really do n't believe I wrote it ! " Gershwin 's appetite for popularity , says his biographer , took him even further from the critics ; he could never quite forsake the Hollywood sound stage for Carnegie Hall . When a producer accused him of aiming too high , Gershwin sent a reassuring message : " Rumors about highbrow music ridiculous . . . am out to write hits . "
