It was bound to happen . First there were snow skiers . You know , the people who get a kick out of fastening boards to their feet and schussing down slopes . Then came the wind surfers , a group of sailors whose thrills are derived from fastening a sail atop a surfboard to schuss around lakes and oceans . Next came the cross-country skiers , who  --  undaunted by the absence of mountains to ski down  --  have taken their passion for the out-of-doors to the flatlands of the world . And now , wouldn ' t you know it , there are wind skiers , a group of enlightened winter and summer sports enthusiasts who have combined the thrills of skiing and boardsailing into a unique sport that is so new nobody is sure exactly what to call it . Actually , whether you choose the label windskiing , snowsailing or skisailing , it all comes down to the same thing . That is , you attach a sail to skis , find a snow-filled field or mountainside , catch the wind and away you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory this does sound like a rather simple development in the never-ending quest to have fun . You may be saying to yourself , " Why didn ' t I think of that ? " Or perhaps you already have thought of it , and even have tried holding your coat open on a windy day while out skiing only to discover that wind skiing is a lot easier said than done . If this is the case , as it was for the pioneers of the sport , you will be heartened to know that six American companies now manufacture snowsailing apparatuses featuring a number of technological advances . All of these innovations are based on the " free sail " system familiar to boardsailors . The free sail system is a patented design consisting of a mast , sail and boom which rotates 360 degrees in a pivotal socket . Boardsailors attach the sail system to their sailboards . Windskiers attach the same sail system to a variety of devices which attach to downhill or cross- country skis . One of the most popular of these devices is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which uses the free sail system mounted on a small board , which in turn is mounted on skis , allowing the sailor to move freely around the mast while standing in the direction of sail , thus allowing for tacking and jibing moves . Another popular type of device is the " Ski Sailer " ( $325 without skis or sail ) , an invention of snowsailing pioneer Carl Meinberg . The Ski Sailer has a mast attachment which connects to a steel plate , which in turn bolts onto four rubber power joints on the front of the skis . The Ski Sailer requires its user , who is facing forward in his or her ski boots , to reach out and twist to counterbalance the wind-filled sail . Meinberg has reached speeds of 48 m. p. h. on his Ski Sailer . Most companies marketing windskiing devices use a variation of these two principles . If you are one of the estimated 2 , 000 sailboard owners in the Chicago area , and own skis , you need only purchase the attachment unit .
