EVITA PERON <P> Feb. 23 and 24 ; NBC ; 9p.m . E.S . T. <P> This is a part any actress would die to play . One actress did : the ' 40s radio performer Eva Duarte . At 17 she was an ambitious ingenue who moved up by sleeping around ; at 27 she was the First Lady of Argentina , the power behind Juan Pern ; at 33 she was dead of cancer . She was one smart cookie , laced with strychnine-Eva Brains and Evita Braun . As a wily teenager , she ran through lovers like a bull on the pampas ; as Senora Pern , she stalked the corridas of power , sniffing for the blood of old enemies . Young Eva told a colleague she wanted to play the great ladies of history : Joan of Arc , Queen Elizabeth , Lucrezia Borgia . Her wish was her destiny and her doom . Fate and a will of steel cast her as the avatar of all these women , and when she died her grieving lover was the nation . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has the cool , carnivorous intelligence needed to play a dictator 's doxy . When the material is tepid , she puts a fire under it to make it percolate . When given a strong scene , like the dying Evita 's farewell radio address , she can key several moods - weariness , coquetry , defiance - while providing the scene with a swift climactic kick . But Writer Ronald Harwood and Director Marvin Chomsky allow too much of Evita Pern to glide by on casters ; and James Farentino , as Pern , looks and acts as if he could be Robert De Niro 's older brother who went into accounting . One brief scene - in which Eva greets her new lover Juan with her arms and a leg sticking out seductively from behind an easy chair , like a Marcel Duchamp construction with moving parts - hints at the vibrant high camp to which Evita Pern might have aspired . <P> The rest is as drowsy as a hot Sunday in Buenos Aires .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
