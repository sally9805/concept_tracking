 | Elias felt a grim annoyance . Whitt if they were ? A woman with Briana 's appetites  --  and lower  --  could have as many different lovers as she chose . Yeah , but why did you have to be one of them ? He felt indignant . Why did she 'd seduced him before Beth , he 'd have brushed it off with no more than a bad taste , but it 'd been after Beth  --  much too soon after  --  and it did n't matter that Briana had preyed on his grief in the most unconscienable way . He was still a grown-up man , and he could have said no . Enough ! Elias thought with exasperation . It 's just a rumor , and even if it 's true , you 're probably not the father , and even if you are " Elias , something is wrong , is n't it ? " Martha 's reflection gazed at him from the forward viewscreen of the cockpit . The warm-lit cabin dwindled behind her , superimposed on the frigid black of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could talk about , the dark center of his fear : No child could ever belong to both Briana and me . And Briana is Imperator . " Thought I smelled something funny , " he told her . " But now it 's gone . And so are we  --  the second we pass Luna 's orbit . You ready ? " " You kidding ? A month without VD lectures to simpering praetorians , without having to pluck whiskey glass out of their rumps or stitch up their lips . Know what my number one surgery is ? Rebuilding praetorian fists . It 's worse than the VD . I ca n't seem to teach them that mandibles are tougher than phalanges . " She gave him one of her lopsided grins , and he felt better . He was starting to like that smile a lot . He looked at her , wishing he could forget everything else and just stare until he understood what about her looks so endlessly fascinated him . Other women were more beautiful  --  Briana , for example . But Martha was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awkward , girlish look that vanished when she moved ; he loved her walk ? her long stride , her unselfconscious , loose-jointed grace . Her auburn hair would be gorgeous long , but she kept it short  --  easy to tuck under the cap in surgery . He liked it that way , a soft , tawny shag , because she 'd rather have an edge in OR than look gorgeous . He liked her eyes too , even though they were a nondescript gray . They could look incredibly vivid and striking between a surgical mask and cap . They seemed to take on other colors like a chameleon . Now there were points of green in them from the side-panel instrument lights ?  | Elias realized he was stating endlessly , and that Martha was aware of it . Ile flushed and busied himself with a final check on the jump solution . Martha must know about Briana , he realized as he worked . She 's not ob/gyn , but she 'd be in charge of assigning one . I could ask her Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd made Martha his mother-confessor after Briana  --  a bonehead mistake , if ever there was one . " Pendrake 's been telling me about Cephan , " Martha said . " I ca n't wait to see the chartreuse seas , and those ancient tents on the plain of Roon . " " The Mardandris dwellings , " Pendrake supplied , his powerful , three-fingered hand probing at access panel #4 . Pendrake went on talking about Cephan , but Elias could n't concentrate on his words . Instead , he imagined himself holding a small , warm bundle wrapped in blankets , gazing at its perfect little face , feeling its chubby fingers grip his nose . His throat constricted . A girl  --  he 'd like a girl best , though he was n't sure why . A wave of longing passed through him and a sense of futility . No child could belong to both of us . He tried to shrug off his gloom , tuning in to Pendrake 's conversation with Martha . . . . an ancient race , thought to inhabit the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we Cephantines existed . The climate there is so mild , the Mardandris were able to live in tents . The fabric of them is thin as a butterfly wing and clear as crystal , yet they are indestructible . At night , when the wind blows from the north , the tents sing . It is very beautiful and very sad . " Elias heard the longing in Pendrake 's voice , and was ashamed at letting his own preoccupations taint the start of the trip . Pendrake had not been back to Cephan since he was captured there by outlaw slavers almost ten years ago . This would be a joyful homecoming for him . So cheer up , Elias told himself , or you 'll spoil his fun . The ship plunged into darkness . Elias heard Martha 's nervous laugh , and then the thunk of an access panel popping free , and he knew with a sinking feeling that it must be the panel he 'd decided not to check . It was a nexus for the ship 's lights . The ship was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fixed it .  | He reached under the control console for the handApsh . The strange smell hit him again , much stronger . S ' u n iphs ! Panic surged through him . I le thumbed desperately at the switch of the handflash . Nothing happened . The deck remained pitch dark . Elias ' stomach twisted into a knot . " Come forward , " he shouted . " Now ! " " Elias ? " Martha 's voice was tight with fear . " It 's all right , " he said , forcing calm into his voice . " Be careful . Do n't fall . " He groped for the rotational control , feeling Pendrake brush by him , hearing Martha grunt and knowing with relief that Pendrake must have grabbed her . Elias found the control and rotated the ship , at the same time locating the viewport controls , punching them all down . The overhead viewport shields hissed open , dropping slivers of moonlight onto the deck . Elias focused on the one nearest their feet , watching it widen out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewport with Luna . When the rectangle of moonlight started to narrow again , Elias killed the Wager 's rotation . He stared down with cold dread at the patch of milky radiance . A creature the size of a rat crawled into it . For a second he hoped that it was a rat , and then he knew it was n't  --  no tail , a gleaming brown carapace , the tilting , beetle-like crawl . His heart began to hammer with fear . It was a s'uniph all right , and unless he did something fast , they were all dead . Damn , another one , and then more , crawling toward them through the moonlight . There must be a hundred of them ! The first was only a meter from their feet . Someone must have planted them behind the panel , along with a small , timed charge that would simultaneously kill the lights and free the insects . Outrage burned through him . Who ? Why ? His anger turned against himself . If you had n't been in such a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " " Insects . The Ornyl use them as a weapon . They can bore through almost anything . They deposit larvae that migrate through the bloodstream and feed on heart tissue . If we want to be alive tomorrow , we ca n't let even one of them too close . " Elias saw that the rectangle of moonlight was full of them now , a horde , crawling toward them slowly , inexorably . They smell us , he  | thought , just like I smelled them , but they know what they 're smelling . Hosts . He shuddered . A thousand squirming larvae , crawling through your veins Martha said , " Ca n't we just smash them with something ? " " Carapace is too hard . You could drive a tank over them and they 'd keep right on crawling . " Burn them ! he thought . With what ? The Wager was engineered nonflammable , and there was no provision for making a fire , too damned deadly on a ship in space . An inspiration struck Elias . " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the console . " He heard her groping for it . " Here ! " " Good . Has it got a cauterizer ? " " Sure . " " Turn it on and give it to me , quick ! " Seconds crawled by . Elias could hear the soft tick of s'uniph legs on the deck . A pinpoint of light from the cauterizer glowed to life a few feet away . " Elias , I 'm holding the iron straight up . Grab it about ten centimeters down . Careful ! " " Right . " His fingers closed around hers . He could feel her hand trembling as he took the iron from her . The glow swelled into a soft halo as the cauterizer heated up . As a handflash , it was pitifully inadequate ? the thing was designed for heat , not light . But heat was what he wanted most  --  fire , burn the ugly things ! He held the cauterizer out and down . In its dull , reddish glow he saw a s'uniph inches from Martha 's ankle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked out , flipping the creature back into the darkness . " Get back ! Pendrake , help her up onto the console ! Get as high up as you can , both of you . The bloody things can jump ! " Elias held the iron out , waving it in front of him . The floor was a brown mass of movement . His throat went dry with fear . With a yell , he plunged the tip of the iron into the back of the lead s'uniph , pinning it to the floor , feeling the hardness of its carapace through the handle of the cauterizer . It squirmed , its shell glowing , then smoldering God , one was on his wrist !  | He twisted away in panic , flinging it off before it could bore into his skin . He realized with a sinking feeling that the cauterizer was no good , there were too many of them , the point of heat was too small . As he tried to hold it on one , the others would get him . He needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the by-products from ship 's hydroponics tanks and waste recycling was methane gas , periodically piped out to the outer hull , where it could be manually vented when the ship was in space . Had he vented recently ? Please , God , no ! Two s'uniphs  --  at his ankles ! He kicked in a fury , trying to visualize the correct access panel . Number six ? Or was it seven ? He gasped a deep breath and launched himself across the sea of crawling insects . " Elias ! " He did not answer , needing all his concentration to stay upright . The insects rolled under his feet , treacherous as flattened ball bearings . He felt himself slipping , pitching forward . He grabbed the molded surface of an access panel , clinging to his balance , kicking , feeling the weight of one fastening itself to his boot . Damn , hooking in with its borer . He held the tip of the cauterizer against it and it recoiled , dropping away . He tore at the access panel in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects behind him . Chew on that , you bastards ! He held the tip of the cauterizer into the exposed panel , illuminating the relays and circuit panels , but the vent hose did not pass through this panel . Damn ! Next panel  --  quickly ! He jerked and tore at it , hurling it down , feeling a drag on his boot and kicking out in revulsion . He found the vent hose . Good ! There  --  below it , the trip handle , used to flush out the gas . But first he had to tear the hose loose from the safety ring that locked the end of it to the outer hull . Then he could reel it back inside the ship , flush the tanks and use the hose as a sort of flame thrower If there was enough methane ! He grabbed the hose in an agony of hope and fear , and pulled with all his might . The line would n't budge . He swore in frustration , kicking , thrashing his feet as the insects closed around him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoop and shovel them away from him .  | " Elias , " " Stay back ! " But he heard Pendrake pounding toward him across the deck . Holding the cauterizer out like a handflash , he saw Pendrake 's boots crawling with insects , knew there were too many , that they 'd already started boring . " Quick ! Can you pull this free ? " " Certainly , Elias . " Elias bit back a hysterical laugh . Pendrake would be polite at his own execution ! The big alien grabbed the line from him and heaved on it . It tore free . Elias flushed the vent lever and the rotten eggs stink of methane rushed from the end of the hose . Sweetest damn thing he 'd ever smelled ! His hand shook as he held the glowing tip of the cauterizer to the end of the vent hose . The spewing gas puffed into a huge fireball , filling the cabin with orange light , singeing his eyebrows . He gulped and pinched down on the plastic , cutting down the gas flow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through him . It was going to work ! He plunged the end against Pendrake 's boots . In seconds , the s'uniphs burst into flame . They sloughed away with a screeching sound that chilled Elias ' blood . Pendrake slapped at his boots , snuffing the fire . Elias bent forward and thrust the torch into the writhing mass of insects . The front line of them caught fire , and then the flames spread back across the writhing mass , throwing the interior of the Wager into a hellish orange light . He looked for Martha , saw her standing on the control console , one leg drawn up , her back hunched into the curve of the overhead . He saw that a knot of s'uniphs had jumped to the console . One was closing on her foot . No ! A savage yell tore from his throat . He dashed through the flaming sea of insects , pulling the vent line with him until it brought him up short , still two meters from her . " Martha ! Jump ! " She sprang down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the line at them , watching with fierce satisfaction as they crisped and curled in the flames . The nutty smell turned sweetish and foul as they burned . He choked on the stink , coughing . The cabin was filling with smoke , noxious , asphyxiating . Worse , it was getting very hot . Every kilo of heat shielding was on the outside of the Wager , where it had to be for reentry . The ship was n't designed for such hellish heat inside . If the fire got much worse , it 'd start fusing circuits all through the inner skin of the ship . Fuse the  | wrong relays , and the conventional launch fuels could blow out of sync and send them cartwheeling on a long funeral voyage of no return , or ? if they were lucky  --  smash them down against Luna . Elias felt a cold wave of fear . He did not want to die , not if there might be a child  --  hell , not if there was n't one , either . He realized there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd killed all the insects . He searched the deck , coughing , looking for intact s'uniphs . There  --  six or seven of them to the side of the others , not burning . He skirted the flaming mass in the center of the deck and held the burning hose out toward the survivors . The flame guttered and went out as the last of the methane burned away . He swore and dropped the nozzle , flanking the insects , kicking them into the burning mass in the center . He looked up and saw that Pendrake was standing by with the fire extinguisher . Good ! " Wait , " he said . " We have to be sure ! " Pendrake nodded . The fire was at its height , blazing hot . Elias saw the struts of the overhead shimmering in the heat . " OK , go ! " Pendrake emptied the extinguisher into the fire ; steam rose , bits of foam swirled around the cabin . The fire shrank but burned on . Martha brought a cannister of water from the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pendrake grabbed a galley pan and Elias joined in , snatching a big steam pot , helping form a relay . His mind went blank . He was aware , dimly , of his muscles laboring - fill , pass on , take the empty , fill again  --  and then he could n't see and he realized the fire was out . He slumped down against the toilet , shaking with relief . The relief faded , turning to fury . " Those bastards ! " He felt Martha 's hand on his shoulder . " Who , Elias ? " " I do n't know . " He tried to think . Who would want us dead ? Why ? He got up and felt his way back into the main cabin , still quaking with reaction . Pendrake had already rolled the ship , centering a square of moonlight on the panel that had been sabotaged . The moonlight leached Pendrake 's face of color . " They removed several circuit boards , Elias . Do you have others ? " " I did , in the overhead storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pendrake disappeared from the shaft of moonlight and Elias heard  | the storage door slide back . It appears you are right , " the alien said gravely . " Can you fly this ship in the dark , Elias ? " " To get back to Earth right now , I would fly this ship hanging by my heels from the overhead with my hands tied behind me . " Martha laughed and he heard the giddy release of tension in her voice . " Using your nose , no doubt , " she said . " Right . Hunt and peck . " Elias remembered Pendrake and felt a rush of sympathy . " I 'm sorry about Cephan , my friend . " " Forget Cephan ! I just want to plant my feet on solid ground again . We will go to Cephan another time . " Elias knew that Pendrake was hiding disappointment . He felt another surge of fury at whoever had done this . He would find out . They would pay . With a crackle of static , the communicator burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual hailing code ; then an angry , female voice broke in : " Forget all that twaddle . Elias Kane , this is the Imperator . Are you reading me ? " " I 'm reading you , sir , " Elias said . She 'd called herself the Imperator , not Briana . Formality seemed to be called for . " How dare you sneak off like this ? " " I 'd hardly call it sneaking off , sir . " Except that 's exactly what it was . Elias felt dread welling up inside him again . Why was she calling ? He made an effort to bluff it through . " May I remind Your Highness that she does not presently hold me under contract ? " " Do n't split hairs with me , Kane . I 'm ordering you home at once , do you understand ? " " Yes , sir . " " You are to report to me the second you land . Your little pleasure cruise is over . " Elias looked with disbelief at the smoldering embers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " THE IMPERATOR MUTTERED . " YOU KNOW what that means ? " Elias tried to form an answer , but all he could think of was her belly . He fought a compulsion to stare at it . Was she showing or not ? He knew he must have glanced down a dozen times already , and yet he had no clear impression . His head buzzed with anxiety . What did she just say ? S'uniphs  --  asking me what it means . Elias fingered his chin , pretending to consider . Just one good look , slow and calm . He glanced at her bodysuit , a soft , brushed material , black and glossy as raven wings . On its front , stitched in silver , was the tree emblem of the Amerdaths . He let his eyes follow the tree down ? foliage over the breasts , trunk descending over her stomach , roots spreading suggestively below her belt . Lust swelled through him . He suppressed it , annoyed with himself . Her waist seemed slim as ever ? not the slightest thickening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . She could be several months pregnant and still show nothing in her waist " Are you going to stand there gaping at me ? " Briana snapped . " I asked you a question . " " I 'm afraid I do n't know . " She gave a delicate snort . " The great Elias Kane , intergalactic detective , stumped by the obvious . What 's the most likely way anyone could get ahold of that many s'uniphs ? " " On Ornyl , " he said . " Or from an Ornyl , " she amended . She turned her back , mounting the steps to her throne two at a time , whirling to sit . She stared down at him with an intensity that made  | him uncomfortable . lie remembered seeing that same look on her father 's face  --  a hungry , prying eagerness to enter your mind and paw through whatever was there . He did not like Briana up there staring down at him . He was suddenly repelled by this vast , overrich throne room , with its statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satyrs chasing across the frescoed ceiling . When it had been her father 's , this room had shown a Spartan restraint . But now it reeked of both power and excess . " Either an Ornyl tried to do you in , " Briana said , " or someone who counted on an Ornyl contact to supply the s'uniphs . Find the Ornyl , and you find the saboteurs . And I do n't think we have to look very far . " He saw where she was leading . " Chuddath ? " " It makes sense , does n't it ? Your ship is housed in one of the palace 's private berths . The sabotage must have been done there . Chuddath 's the only Ornyl warrior in the palace , not to mention the rest of Earth . " " That we know of . " Briana gave a derisive laugh . " Come on , Elias . An Ornyl is not exactly hard to spot . And I 've not rescinded my father 's decree . They 're banned here , you know that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Papa got Chuddath , he decided the only thing that could beat his new bodyguard was another Ornyl . He was wrong , of course . Poor Papa . " Elias found himself resisting what she was saying . He had no great love for Gregory Amerdath 's bodyguard  --  how could anyone ? But Chuddath and he had been through hell together , and that ought to count for something . He said , " How could it be Chuddath when he never leaves the vault door ? He even has his food brought to him . " " It , Elias . It has its food brought to it . " Elias recoiled inwardly from the heat in her voice , the racial hatred , so quick to ignite . He felt an involuntary disgust for the flawed heart inside the perfect young body . Please . Do n't be bearing our child . He suppressed a bleak laugh . I 'm obsessed , he thought . Why do I keep coming back to it ? " Just because Chuddath does n't leave that vault door , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come to it . " " Do n't Alvar Sabin 's men keep watch too ? " " At a distance , " Briana conceded . " It wo n't let any praetorians closer than thirty meters . As if they would harm my father  --  what 's left of him , " she added bitterly . " The most important part of him is left , " Elias said more sharply  | than he had intended . " And it was a praetorian who attacked him the first time . " Briana 's face flushed . She sprang up from the throne and stalked down the curving steps as if she wanted to strike him . Ile held himself still , determined not to back away . She pulled up inches from his face . " Yes , " she hissed . " But what about all the other times ? It 's rather like the fox guarding the chickens , do n't you think ? " " Chuddath is incapable of the slightest disloyalty to your father . He always was and always will be . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let yourself think about it , that Chuddath might have some very good reasons to want you dead . It might n't consider you the folk hero portrayed in the synpapes . It might even feel that you thwarted my father 's will . Exposed him to shame . " The suggestion made Elias uncomfortable . " No human can know how Chuddath feels , " he countered , knowing he was being stubborn . " Except for one , " Briana said softly . " My father . He can see into Chuddath 's mind through the S'edhite link . " She shuddered and hugged her arms , then quickly crossed them as if ashamed of showing weakness . " I 'm going to open the vault , " she said firmly . " And bring my father back . " Elias looked at her , appalled . God , and I walked right into it . " My father is the one human alive , " she went on defensively , " who could tell us whether Chuddath tried to have you killed . " A wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . " You must n't . " She gazed speculatively at his hand and he pulled it back , wondering what had possessed him to touch her . " Why not , Elias ? " " You know his final orders to us all . We were not to bring him back , except to restore him to a body . " " Do you also remember my reply ? " she said in a low voice , " when he tried to give me other final ' orders . I told him that I was Imperator now . You should enshrine his answer to that in your heart . He said , That 's the only answer a true Imperator could give . ' " For a second her eyes looked weary and pained . But her voice remained firm . " I am your Imperator now , Elias . In all things , I must do what I think best . " Elias was filled with sick dread . To revive Gregory Amerdath from his dreams , to expose him once again to his unbearable reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel , unthinkable . He said , I am one of the people who was almost killed . I want to know who and why at  | least as much as you do . But even if I knew it would prove Chuddath guilty , I would not want your father awakened . " She touched his face gently . " You do n't value your own life enough , Elias . That saddens me , but it changes nothing . I value you . I want to know who tried to kill you , even if you do n't . " Elias felt a deep uneasiness . I " value " you  --  it was not what he wanted to hear right now . She strode to the towering doors of the throne room , leaving him behind . Her touch lingered on his cheek , chilling him with foreboding . She turned . " Come on , " she commanded . " We 'll get it over quickly . " He looked at her , seeing suddenly a human panther , the same muscular , green-eyed beauty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her . His mouth went dry . " Chuddath will never let you open the vault . People will die . " " Then so be it . " Elias stood with Martha and Pendrake before Amerdath 's vault . A few paces in front of them was Briana , flanked by two praetorian captains . They faced the Ornyl warrior , who stood with his back to the bronze doors of the vault , immobile as a statue . Elias felt chilled looking at the mantis head , the expressionless compound eyes , the huge wings ? so like a mammoth roach 's  --  that half cloaked the massive fighting arms . He felt a brief , unwanted empathy with Briana 's revulsion for Chuddath . It was one thing to value in the abstract the intelligence ? and perhaps the soul  --  that hid inside that grotesque body , and quite another to stand in the warrior 's presence . Elias thought of what lay beyond Chuddath inside that vault , and his chill deepened : a disembodied , living head . All that remained of the legendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets . Elias closed his eyes , remembering the awful images of Amerdath being struck down by an assassin , Martha surgically sawing his head from its blackened , dying body and putting it on a cushion of medical surgifoam . He felt a twinge of nausea , resisting the images that were even worse : Beth Tyson , sprawled on the next table over from Amerdath , her life draining away beyond reclamation . He felt a sharp stab of pain ; then the cushioning of time and distance rebounded inside him , driving out all but a small , lingering ache . He focused again on the vault , on the spark of life preserved inside it . It was as close as Amerdath could come to having a body .  | In a way , it was very close indeed . In his memories , augniented by the incredible technology of the sliver implants , he possessed again the body of his younger self  --  and all the past that body had lived through . What was Amerdath doing now ? Elias wondered . Planning strategy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viceroy , Richard DuMorgan , against the alien Andinaz raiders ? Or perhaps making love to a woman , climbing a mountain , drinking whiskey and dashing the glass into the fire . And now we drag him back to hell , Elias thought , sickened . He felt Martha 's hand slip into his and gave it a squeeze , trying to convey a reassurance he did not feel . He watched Briana try to stare the Ornyl warrior down , waiting for it to respond , acknowledge her . Chuddath 's huge , muscular legs remained planted apart . The mantis head looked out from the vault doors , the target of the blank , compound eyes a mystery . It was the absolute stillness of the insect which , lacking a purpose , does not move . Watching Briana stubbornly await the Ornyl warrior 's acknowledgment , Elias felt a sudden rush of insight : This was not about finding who had sabotaged the Wager . It was about power , love and loyalty . Within Amerdath 's brain was embedded more than the sterile , memorycharged slivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Amerdath was still a whole man , he had taken into his own brain a piece of Chuddath 's ; the macabre S'edhite ritual , giving man and alien total insight into each other 's minds . Amerdath could , indeed , see whether Chuddath had played any part in sabotaging the Wager . But that 's not why Briana wants to revive her father , Elias thought . She wants to destroy Chuddath . He felt a sudden sadness for her . How she must resent the alien 's S'edhite closeness to her father  --  an intimacy she had never had and could never hope for . Now she had the perfect pretext for Chuddath 's undoing . Because of the S'edhite link , Chuddath could not disobey his lord 's last command : Do not awaken me , not ever , unless it is to give me back the body . Briana , on the other hand , could disobey that command . In some perverse way she had to , to prove that she was truly Imperator and  --  in the same calculated stroke  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one booted foot , and knew with a sinking feeling that she was through waiting . " Chuddath , I order you to stand aside from the door , " she said . The alien stirred at last . The chubby vocal hands emerged from  | their protection under the massive fighting arms . With rapid , cricketlike motions , they stroked the contoured patch on the abdomen , producing the eerie , violinlike voice . " For what purpose ? " " Because I am your Imperator , " Briana snapped . " Do you wish . . . merely to look ? " Chuddath persisted , pausing in the characteristic way to rest the hands between words . " That is none of your concern . " " My orders were clear . " " I give you your orders . Stand aside . " " You mean to . . . awaken him ? " " Yes , " Briana said , and Elias knew he was correct . All she need have done was lie to Chuddath . Once inside the vault with her father , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in that scenario , Chuddath would not have failed . Do something , Elias thought . He stepped forward , then paused , hearing the disciplined quick-step of boots rounding the curving corridor to the vault . A cohort of praetorians in full battle gear ran into the chamber and formed up . To one side paced Alvar Sabin , himself , commander of the guard and old comrade of Gregory Amerdath . Elias suppressed a groan . Any chance of averting this catastrophe had just shrunk almost to nothing . Sabin hated Chuddath , always had , and his reasons were as simple as Briana 's were complex : Sabin had never accepted that his praetorians might not be enough to guard his old comrade  --  that he should be forced to share that honor with a loathsome alien . When they had both failed Amerdath , it had only inflamed Sabin 's hatred of Chuddath . Elias took Briana 's arm . She turned , eyes glittering , and patted his hand . With an effort he kept himself from recoiling . " Let me talk to Alvar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because he is going to want to kill Chuddath , and we have to be sure he does n't . " " I realize that , " she said impatiently . " I 'm going to order him not to . " Accidents ' can happen in the heat of battle . With a stubborn old bulldog like Alvar , orders and persuasion are better than just orders . You are Imperator , and ca n't be seen stooping to persuasion before your own men . But they wo n't think anything of it if I talk to him . " Briana looked uncomfortable . " What do you plan to say ? "  | " That a Chuddath humiliated is better than a Chuddath dead  --  a Chuddath incapable of appreciating who defeated him . " A look of shock crossed Briana 's face , and he knew he had hit the mark , not just for Alvar Sabin , but for her . She gave him a chill smile . " Sometimes you are almost too clever for your own good . Go ahead . " Elias hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction , then shook it , keeping an eye on the Ornyl warrior . " You know that the Imperator wants Chuddath unharmed , " Elias said . " Yes . " " I want something too . " Sabin gave him a hard look . " What ? Be quick . " " If you can take Chuddath ? " " Oh , I 'll take him , all right . " " Try to persuade Briana not to revive her father . It should be enough for her  --  and for you  --  to put Chuddath in a cell . " Sabin 's face reddened . " You presume , Kane . " " Let 's not try to fool each other , there is n't time . You were his oldest and best comrade . You know his last orders . " " I do n't need you to remind me , " Sabin snapped . " And I know something else , too . He was half insane when he gave those orders . " Elias looked at the commander with dismay . What was this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've had time to think . I should never have let it happen . The man who ordered that vault closed on himself was not the man I knew for fifty years , the man I fought beside . He 's trapped , Kane . Trapped in an endless nightmare . At night , when I lie in my bed , I can hear his spirit screaming , pleading with me to get him out . " A sudden sweat appeared on Sabin 's forehead . He looked sick around the eyes . He really believes it , Elias thought . He felt a surge of desperation . " Alvar , listen to me : What has been done for Gregory Amerdath is the best that can be done at this point . He is safe in his past . He does not even know it 's his past . He thinks it 's happening now . It is in every way real . " " You ca n't know that . " Elias heard a shuffle of feet , the restless clink of body armor among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . A sudden , irrational doubt struck him . What if Alvar 's right ? Elias shook off the doubt . " I know that , if you allow Amerdath to be awakened , then he will be in nightmare . "  | Alvar stared hack at him , stonefaced . " It 's not my decision . " " You have influence . . . . " " We 've talked enough . Stand aside . And keep your pacifist Cephantine friend out of this . I bear him no malice , but if he tries to interfere , 1'Il do what I have to do . " Elias felt a hot , quick fury burn through him . He moved closer to Alvar , speaking barely above a whisper . " Harm a hair of Pendrake 's head , and I 'll see you broken . " Ile wheeled away before Sabin could answer . Behind him he heard the commander snap , " Form two squads . " Elias rejoined Martha and Pendrake . When he turned again , the praetorians had separated into two smaller groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dread settled in the pit of Elias ' stomach . " They 're not going to kill Chuddath , " he murmured . " They 're going to try not even to hurt him . " " Elias , I hope you are right . " " Whatever happens , do n't interfere . " Pendrake did not answer and Elias ' dread grew , spreading through him in a sickening wave . " Sidearms ! " Sabin commanded . " Belay , " Briana said . Sabin paled , turned to her stiffly . " Imperator , this is an Ornyl . We need sidearm fire to subdue him . It can be done without killing him . " " I do n't want it injured . Wrestle it down and bind it . " Chuddath made a derisive , keening sound , and bent forward , spreading the immense fighting arms in contemptuous invitation . Sabin reddened and saluted Briana . " Take him , " he shouted . The two squads rushed Chuddath at the same time , a disciplined mass of black-clad bodies , hurling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The massive fighting arms blurred into motion . Men began to fly back from him . Elias watched in horror as the Ornyl flung praetorians against the walls , bashed them on the vault doors , crushed them together and dropped them . Blood spattered the walls and ran in darkly gleaming rivulets on the marble floor . Elias heard the terrible crunch of bones shattering and clenched his teeth against a surge of nausea . Dimly , he felt Martha 's face pressing into his shoulder . He felt dizzy with disbelief . How could this be happening , in this unearthly near silence , the maimed praetorians too disciplined even to scream ?  | Ile saw Sabin turn beseechingly to Briana , whose face had gone white . " Sidearms , " Sabin hissed . " I beg you ! " She gave a slight , stiff nod . " Blasters ! " Sabin shouted . Elias groped behind him for Pendrake , realized too late that he was n't there . He watched , frozen in horror , as Pendrake raced between the praetorians . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pendrake leapt between them and turned in front of Chuddath , spreading his arms in protection of the other alien . The praetorians hesitated , turning back to their commander with confused looks . Feeling paralyzed in nightmare , Elias saw Sabin raise his ruptor , aim it at Pendrake 's head . God , NOOO ! Before Elias could move , Sabin fired .  | PENDRAKE TOPPLED TO THE FLOOR . Elias felt rage swelling , bursting inside him bastard I 'll kill you smash your face . Blankness , a dim pain in his fist , then he saw Sabin 's face at the end of a red tunnel . He pressed after the face , hating it , feeling a savage , tearing release in his pumping fists as he threw his whole body into it . His legs tangled and he pitched forward  --  a body squirming under him , then Sabin 's face again , now close , his nose spurting blood , eyes incredulous . Elias shouted something , feeling spikes of fury behind his eyes , control yourself no kill you , you snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off Sabin . He bucked and twisted in a frenzy I 'm not through , let me go ! He saw black uniforms closing around him , then the floor rearing up , slapping him in the side . Pain penetrated for a second then puffed away . Something slamming into his buttock , pain again but it did n't matter  --  yes it did a boot , the bastards , kicking him . He rolled , tried to spring up , but slipped on the hard , gritty marble , banging a knee . . . . stop , stop , Stop ! " His vision cleared and he stopped , disoriented . Who ? ? Briana , screaming at them to stop . He realized he was sitting . Dimly , he was aware of praetorians standing frozen around him . Rage rebounded inside him . He did not want to stop , where was Sabin ? There  --  sitting up , blotting at his nose with the meat of his thumb . Sabin gazed at him with a mixture of sheepishness and respect . " Not bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore , " Elias choked . His rage began to mix with grief ; a terrible ache rose through his chest and throat . Beth and now Pendrake . Am I death to everyone I love ?  | " I 'm not done with you , " he spat at Sabin . " I warned you to keep him out of it ? " " Shut up , both of you , " Briana snapped . Elias felt his fury spilling over onto her . Shut your face , damn you , if you had n't , I 'll His rage burned itself out . He twisted around on the seat of his pants , feeling a startling jab of pain in his rear , dismissing it . He must get up , find Pendrake 's body He saw Pendrake standing beside Chuddath . For a second he could not believe  --  no one could outjump a blaster beam  --  and then he realized with dawning elation that Pendrake had not jumped , he 'd been pushed . Relief flooded Elias . He sprang up and shouted , " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I shouted at you , Elias , but you did not seem to hear me . " Pendrake turned hurriedly back to Chuddath , and Elias saw that the warrior was hunched down on one side . His left fighting arm dangled limply , ribbons of greenish-black sludge pouring down from the shoulder . Elias felt a quick shock of sympathy , seeing suddenly the human part of Chuddath  --  a grotesquely deformed man , wounded and in pain . Pendrake said something to Chuddath that Elias could not hear . Chuddath 's vocal hands , unharmed , rubbed furiously at the contoured abdomen . " Keep your thanks . I care . . . nothing for your life . You ... interfered . I need no . . . help from a grass eater . " Elias felt a laugh pushing up his throat . What ingratitude  --  so outrageous it was funny . A grass eater  --  no , worse : not just a nonfighter , an avowed pacifist  --  saving the fierce warrior . And Chuddath was so insulted that he unwittingly saved Pendrake right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a rush of gratitude to Chuddath . Maybe his shove was n't unwitting . Maybe he cared more for his fellow alien than he cared to admit ... . And maybe pigs could fly . Elias realized his face was split in a stupid grin . Waves of euphoria rolled through him . With an effort , he forced the smile from his face . Pendrake was all right , but the ugly confrontation between Chuddath and Briana was n't over . Chuddath had taken a bad wound , one fighting arm immobilized . He 'd be completely vulnerable on that side . Now he could be beaten .  | Elias gazed at Chuddath , feeling a sudden , fierce resolve : I wo n't let her destroy you . Sabin was still blotting at his nose . He glared at the hunched Chudclath with malevolent pleasure , then gestured to his praetorians . " What are you waiting for ? Take the stinking bug ! " " Wait ! " Elias snapped . " You do n't give the orders here . Your Imperator does . " Sabin reddened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeting smile . " Your Highness , " Elias said , " may I have a word with you ? " " Alvar , hold . " She walked a few steps to the side . Elias followed , feeling a throb in his buttock and shooting pains from his knee . The hand that had punched Alvar ached savagely across the knuckles . He remembered what Martha had said about endlessly repairing the shattered fists of brash young praetorians . He suppressed a groan . I 'm getting too old for this . " Well ? " Briana said . " This is the perfect point to stop . " " Out of the question . " Her voice was mild , indulgent . " You said you . . . valued me . I value you , too . " He paused , surprised to realize that part of him meant it . He saw surprise in her face too , and then a wistful hope . He hurried on , flustered . " You 've beaten Chuddath . Everyone here knows that you could take him now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy , not weakness . " " Lovely , " she said sarcastically . " And if we do n't take Chuddath , just how do we get past him into the vault ? He 'll go on fighting until he 's dead or chained , you know that . " " Not necessarily . He 's a warrior , but not a fool . I think I can get him to step aside . " " How ? " Elias braced himself . " By giving him my word  --  and yours  --  that you wo n't awaken your father . " Briana gave an incredulous laugh . " What have you been sniffing ? " " It 's the only way you can win , " Elias said . " If you had n't wounded Chuddath , you could have gone ahead , but the way it stands now , if you awaken your father , he 'll be furious at what you 've done to his bodyguard . " " I 'm not afraid of Father . I am Irnperator now . " " No question . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to him , too : he can defy you . " Briana 's mouth tightened into a grim line . " You think I ca n't force  | him to mindlink with Chuddath ? Wrong . 11 I have to , I 'll threaten to keep him awake . I can do it just order stimulants and dream-blockers into his blood suPpply . " Elias looked at her , revolted and trying to hide it . How could he feel anything for someone so ruthless ? " Yes , you can do that . But there 's no way in hell you can make him tell you what he sees in Chuddath 's mind . " " You 're overlooking something . My father will want to find whoever 's responsible for the sabotage . He cares for you , considers you one of his most trusted friends and advisors . " " But not closer than Chuddath . No one is  --  no one could be . " Briana looked stung . He cursed inwardly . You went too far , he thought , but then he saw uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the vault . Chuddath had sunk to one knee , clasping his right fighting hand over the wound in his shoulder . Pendrake was fussing over him ; Chuddath kept trying to shoulder him away . Elias looked for Martha , found her on her knees among the fallen praetorians . Her tunic was streaked with blood , and there was a red smear on her cheek . He felt touched , almost shaken , by the sight of her . There was something inexpressibly noble about her at this moment . Briana cleared her throat , and he realized she 'd caught him gazing at Martha . Her eyes were dark with clairvoyance , her expression stony . A chill went through him . " Let me go to Chuddath , " he pleaded . " Give him your word you wo n't awaken Amerdath . He 'll stand aside for you , and the moment he does , you win . You 'll be able to dismiss the guard and let Dr. Reik get the wounded evacuated . " Briana drew a deep breath . Her jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury and frustration . " You think I did all this to humiliate Chuddath , " she said . " Clever , clever Elias . Maybe you 're not all wrong , but you 're wrong . Damn it , I want to know who tried to kill you . " All of a sudden , the anger seemed to drain from her . Her eyes looked luminous , and he realized with amazement that she was close to tears . " So do I , " he said quickly . " And I 'll find out , do n't worry . Finding out is what I do best . " Her eyes cleared , and with startling quickness she looked composed again . She gave him a suggestive smile . " Oh , I do n't know . You do some other things well , too . "  | He forced himself to smile back at the innuendo . A shudder of disgust went through him . But he knew he 'd won . " All right , " Briana said . " Just go over like you 're checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll order him to stand aside . He 'd damned well better do it , with none of his bug impudence . Be sure he understands that . " Elias worked his way through the sprawled praetorians , pausing to give Martha 's shoulder a squeeze . She looked up with a wan smile , and he felt another uncomfortable stab of awareness : Briana behind , watching us . He hurried on , picking his way through the much larger number of wounded concentrated around Chuddath 's feet . Pendrake offered a hand , and he took it , savoring the grip , the final proof of Pendrake 's aliveness . Pendrake helped him step over a fallen praetorian sergeant , whose skull was crushed into a sickening new shape . Elias felt a wave of revulsion at Chuddath , then caught himself . The praetorians attacked him , not the other way around . He risked his life to do his duty to Amerdath . Elias released Pendrake 's hand with a hard squeeze and turned to Chuddath . " I 've come to ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pendrake leaned close to Elias as if to share a confidence . " He heard everything you and the Imperator said . " Elias was amazed , then remembered the intelligence reports on the Ornyl warrior caste he 'd read while in the navy . One section detailed their incredible hearing . But Briana and I were thirty meters away , he thought , practically whispering . He felt suddenly small and inferior standing between the two huge aliens . How do we humans have any power at all over beings like this ? " Obviously you heard everything , too , " he said to Pendrake . " You may rely on my discretion , as always . " Pendrake gave him a humble smile that half irritated , half amused him . Elias turned back to Chuddath . " Will you stand aside ? " he whispered . The warrior barely touched his abdomen , producing a smooth , chilling parody of a whisper . " I accept the word of Kane . " Elias felt himself sagging with relief . " Do you need medical atten-tion ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will mend . I 've lost this . . . arm before . You were witness . "  | Elias remembered the pitched battle only a few months past , the rebel laser that had cleanly sliced off one of Chuddath 's fighting arms . The left ? He could not recall ; only that it had grown back with incredible speed . " Fine , " he said . " I may want to talk to you soon  --  a small matter of some s'uniphs in a breeding frenzy . " Chuddath made no comment . Elias searched the featureless compound eyes . They gazed everywhere and nowhere , as impenetrable as a fly 's . He signaled Briana by turning back to her , as she 'd ordered . Beside her , he saw Alvar Sabin , talking urgently in her ear . She cut Sabin off with a sharp hand gesture . " Chuddath , I command you to stand aside . " " Yes , Imperator . " Elias thought he heard the slightest touch of derision , but then the Ornyl warrior hunched away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fallen Imperator . " I wonder if Father can hear us , " Briana said in a hushed whisper . Elias stared at the head of her father , feeling a mixture of sadness and a horror that was old now , but impossible to suppress . The surgifoam looked like a pillow around the base of his neck . Amerdath 's eyes were closed , his facial muscles totally relaxed . His skin had a healthy , pink flush , and his hair , thick and white as it had been in his youth , was neatly combed . " No , he ca n't hear us , " Elias said . " But I still get the feeling he 's aware , " Briana persisted . " Maybe subliminally . Maybe he smells us . He could be flashing on a dream of us right now . God , it makes my skin crawl . " " Then let 's get out of here , " Elias suggested . He was tired of her ; weary with adrenaline withdrawal . He ached with bruised muscles , flogged nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing in on him . Amerdath could not be awake , not in any way , or he 'd have gone screaming mad in this womblike place , just as Alvar Sabin believed . Elias felt a sudden bitter sadness at the irony of Amerdath 's fate . Outside this vault , thousands of people loved and schemed and walked amid royal splendor , while the architect of that splendor sucked existence through tubes in his neck and lived out the half-lives of metal slivers . Amerdath 's palace was a wonder of the world  --  shell upon shell of beta-steel expanding outward from this silent vault , honeycombed with a hundred thousand rooms and the ever-curving corridors . It could  | be seen for hundreds of miles in every direction , sitting like a manytiered crown atop its desert mesa . Even that towering rock had been shaped to Amerdath 's will , carved and blasted by his engineers into a smooth column , thrusting up two hundred and thirty meters from the Earth like a mailed fist taunting the gods . And now the gods taunted Amerdath back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Amerdath before the first assassination attempt . Mene mene tekel upharsin : Thou art weighed in the balances and found wanting . " Elias ? " He realized she 'd been talking to him . " What ? " " I said we ca n't leave yet . It would look suspicious  --  we worked too hard to get in here . Besides , I need to talk to you , and this place is as good as any . " Resigning himself , Elias found a chair , used by one of the people who maintained Amerdath 's medical equipment . He sat , not caring about the breach of royal etiquette . If Briana minded , she did not show it . She turned her back on her father 's head and toyed with the array of medical equipment on a rolling cart . Elias became aware of the measured , metronomic click of Amerdath 's heart-lung module . At first the mechanical parody of a heartbeat chilled him . Then it became hypnotic , lulling him further into fatigue . He closed his eyes to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from space for a reason . " He heard her take a deep breath . " I 've lost three imperial inspectors on Cassiodorus . " Elias opened his eyes and looked up at her , forcing his brain back to work : Cassiodorus . The colony planet where the ore for beta-steel was mined . The only place the ore could be found , and thus of vital importance to Earth . Imperial inspectors went there quarterly , conducting detailed inspections to make sure the mining was up to quota  --  and that none of the precious ore was being diverted from the imperial monopoly . He began to feel interested . " Lost them ? " Briana made an irritated throwaway gesture with her hand . " Two heart attacks and a stroke . All fatal . All before they could file their reports . Cassiodorus is a heavy-G planet , as I 'm sure you know . Almost 1.5 G 's , to be more precise . People not used to the extra weight could certainly keel over . In fact , it 's happened once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspectors in a row  --  and all fatal  --  is damned suspicious . "  | " So do I , " Elias said . " You understand what it might mean ? " " The Cassiodorans are trying to break the monopoly . " " Exactly . I 'm pretty sure my viceroy there  --  Cay Endor  --  is loyal . But if there 's a covert rebel faction , they could be siphoning off ore . They might even have a beta-steel factory , probably not there , but underground on some other colony . If they do , and if they 've been stealing ore , you know the first thing they 'd do with it . " Elias felt her suspicions infecting him , dark and frightening , driving out the last of his fatigue . " They 'd build dreadnoughts . " She looked grim . " Exactly . If they succeed , it would mean war . Think what that renegade , DuMorgan , could do against us with a couple of dreadnoughts . We would n't be dealing with an underground anymore , little bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , right here  --  they 'd try to take Earth . " Elias detected an undercurrent of excitement in her voice and was both repelled and amazed . Clearly she knew the dangers , but just as clearly , she relished the thought of a face-to-face war with the rebels . The dreaming remnant of a man behind her would have fought such a war if he had to , and fought it well . But it would have appalled him . Briana would fight the same war with savage relish , and probably even more brilliantly than he . But she was too much the general , thinking she would defeat any attack . The sheer mass of numbers would , indeed , favor her . But if DuMorgan did have dreadnoughts  --  even one of them .. . " I need you to go there , Elias . Investigate the deaths of those inspectors . Do the work they were supposed to do , and bring me a report . " Elias felt his spirits lift . He would escape the palace after all . Space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood began to sing in his ears . He thought of the dreadnoughts again , the brilliant and dashing Richard DuMorgan , so very dangerous . Yes , Imperator , he thought , you need me  --  more than you realize . But what about the Wager ? Someone tried to kill Martha and Pendrake and him , and he could n't just . . . Damn ! A dark excitement filled Elias : Yes , someone had tried to kill him , and Briana had just told him why ! . .. a sizable renumeration , of course , " Briana was saying . " And you would take Pendrake with ? " " Who else knows you plan to send me to Cassiodorus ? "  | She looked startled and he realized he 'd snapped at her . " No one , " she said . " 1 ran the odds on the inspector deaths through my cornpusayer , of course . . . " Realization dawned in her face . " You think that 's why your ship was sabotaged ! " " " What better motive does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous , " she sputtered . " The compusayer is keyed to my own voiceprint only . It 's a machine . It ca n't turn traitor . And there are dozens of safeguards on the data banks . " " Maybe someone with a dozen and one tricks got in , " Elias said . " " Then tried to stop me before I even got started . " Briana paled . " A traitor . He  --  or she  --  would have to be very close to me . Damn ! Damn it to hell ! " " It 's only a possibility , " Elias reminded her . " Call in an outside expert to run a sweep on your compusayer . Do n't let your present staff know about it . " She nodded . " I 'm sorry , Elias . But you 'll have to go anyway , even though this makes it all the riskier . " He saw the gloss in her eyes again , tears close to spilling , and felt a sharp foreboding . As if reading his mind , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He resisted , and she dropped his hands , spun around , hiding her face . All the dread of the past few days rose up to overwhelm him . He heard his voice , a bare whisper . " It 's true , is n't it . " She turned back to him . " What 's true ? " " You 're pregnant . " She gave him a brittle smile . " Yes , it 's true . " Her voice was small , betraying the fear and vulnerability behind the smile . He was stricken suddenly with a feeling of tenderness for her . He held his hands out and she took them again . He squeezed her fingers wordlessly , shocked at how cold they were . Her smile faded and she gave him a searching look . " Are you glad ? " he asked gently . " Yes , I am , " she answered . " Then I 'm glad for you . " " But not for yourself ? " He looked at her , feeling a curious mixture of dread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself , " he said . " Are you saying that I am the father ? " " If I said yes , would you take my word ? " She bit her lip . " No , do n't answer that . You have a right to the truth  --  there 's no other way . There were other men , right around the same time . You were the last . I wish  | now that you had been the only one . " She gave a convulsive laugh . " I was only a dumb princess then , not an all-wise Imperator . " He smiled , feeling a strange dislocation . It was so tempting to see only the woman that stood before him now  --  the surprising maturity , the humanity  --  and forget the cold , bloodthirsty woman she had been only an hour ago . But they were one and the same . " We can know for sure if I 'm the father , " he said . " There should be a biopsy punch on that cart  --  they monitor your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch ? " " Looks something like a syringe . " " Oh , this thing . " " Yes , that 's it . " He showed her how to use it , then rolled up his sleeve . A feeling of fatalism swept over him . Either way , there would be emotional pain , but he must know  --  they both must . He felt first the pinprick , then a slight burn as she twisted the punch and withdrew the cells . He counted back in his mind , trying to fix the approximate day that she seduced him  --  that he 'd let her seduce him . " It should be several weeks yet , " he told her , " before the fetus is big enough for a safe genetic cross match . But take the punch to the lab right away . " She nodded . Beyond her , he saw the silent , impassive face of her father and suddenly felt , as she had earlier , that Amerdath was somehow aware of them , aware that the father of his grandchild might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Amerdath could be awakened . I need you , he thought . Your wisdom , your experience . " Will you want to take Dr. Reik with you to Cassiodorus ? " Briana asked . He felt a warning twinge . " Why would I want to do that ? " " Do n't pretend , Elias . I see the way you look at her . " Suddenly , Briana was the cold , dangerous woman again . He felt afraid for Martha . " She 's just a friend . Pendrake invited her to Cephan . " Technically true , he thought . But only technically . He suppressed a groan , feeling disloyal , slimy . Briana gave him a cool half smile . " Shall we go ? I believe you have some packing to do . " He followed her from the vault . " So Dr. Reik is just a friend . ' I 'm glad , Elias . " She did not look at him , and he knew , with a sinking feeling , that she was not convinced .  | CAREFUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the docking tube toward the battleship , letting his legs trail out behind . The weightlessness felt good after the buffeting crush of the shuttle . But he could not shake a simmering anger at himself . Martha , I 'm sorry . I really hurt her , he thought miserably . Her embrace clung to him in memory . Over and over , he felt himself breaking it , pulling away quickly , because Briana had been watching and you had no choice , damn it ! Elias was filled with hopeless despair . God , bad enough if he could have explained a few minutes later , apologized the next day , but he was gone now . They were cut off , maybe forever , and if it was forever , the final image searing his mind would be Martha , standing there on the apron of the pad , lips pressed together bravely , her nose just that little bit red . Damn you , Briana ! With savage concentration , he imagined the palace receding over the rim of Earth , now nearly five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briana 's hold on him stretching thin over the yawning chasm of space . It gave him a small relief , easing the tension in his neck and shoulders a little . Sayonara , Briana . I 'm rid of you , at least for a while . And this time you wo n't be jerking me back before I can get past Luna . He tried to enjoy the sense of liberation . Instead he felt a vague sense of loss . Regret at leaving the child in Briana 's belly ? No . He 'd not know for some time yet if it was his . And anyway , it was barely into the fetal stage . He 'd be back before it was born  --  unless  | he discorped like the three men sent to ( : assiodorus before him . Tlw morbid thought sent a chill along his neck . Ile shrugged it off , projecting a twisted grin into the dim , swaying cylinder ahead of him . Forget dying . You 're not that anxious to escape Briana . Forgetting , he stretched his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bruised knuckles and shot up his arm . He was aware , suddenly , of a throbbing in his neck  --  must 've twisted it in the fight yesterday without knowing . He yanked himself along to the end of the docking tube , relishing the punishing stabs of pain in his hand . He punched the glowing entry button , biting back a yelp and ignoring Pendrake 's inquiring cough behind him . After a second , the hatch cycled open . He released the line and grabbed the rim of the hole above him , conscious for a dizzying second of his legs dangling at a crazy angle behind him . Then he reoriented , imagining himself in a manhole , levering himself up and through . He straightened and found himself facing a tall man in the working whites of the Imperial Navy : thinning hair , slight paunch , but the four gold stripes circled his wrist with all the authority a man in space could ever need . Behind him Elias saw an honor guard of marines drawn up in a rigid row along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the naval officer , holding out his hand . " Welcome aboard the I.S. Seraphim , Mr. Kane . " " Thank you . " Elias offered his left hand , shaking awkwardly . The corner of Streetham 's mouth twitched , as if he knew the reason , and Elias flushed with embarrassment . " And this must be the legendary Pendrake , " Streetham said . Pendrake levered himself smoothly up from the hatch and gave a slight bow . " You are most kind , Captain . But I would hardly consider myself the stuff of legend . " Streetham smiled . " You 're too modest . The whole planet knows how you saved the Palace from those rebels . Punching through half a meter of granite with your bare fist . " Elias watched Pendrake turn a deeper orange and felt a touch of pity at his discomfort . " Actually , " Pendrake said gravely , " I kicked it . And it was probably more like fifteen centimeters , though I did not stop to measure it ? " Streetham laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your sleep . We 've quartered you here in the outermost ring of the ship as Mr. Kane requested . And our hull is simple steel  --  the Seraphim 's no dreadnought , I 'm afraid . "  | Elias detected an odd note in Streetham 's voice . Resentment ? Was Streetham less than thrilled at diverting his ship into what everyone hoped would be mere taxi service ? Small wonder if he was . The Seraphim was the next biggest thing in space to a dreadnought . Half a kilometer long , a crew of five thousand  --  plus a light legion of marines ? and awesome firepower , including the new implosion missiles . Do n't blame me , Elias thought sourly . He wished again that he 'd been able to talk Briana into a corvette . Hell , a scout ship would have been plenty . She did n't seem to understand that an imperial show of force would only inflame whatever anti-Earth sentiment might be harbored on Cassiodorus . Besides , mysteries were not solved by dreadnoughts , but by careful and unobtrusive investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Kane ? " " A long time ago . " " The Andinaz raids , I believe . You made it from ensign to lieutenant in six months . Rammed one of the bastards ' dragonships , if I recall correctly , and blew it up . " " A mistake , " Elias said . " I was trying to get the hell out of there , and turned the wrong way . " Streetham gave him a knowing smile . " Perhaps you 'd like to review the honor guard ? " Elias walked down the rigid row of marines . The faces seemed absurdly young to him . Their eyes tried with fierce pride to gaze through him , but many of the faces unbraced when he looked into them , letting slip awe and admiration . Their breathless regard depressed him . Were these nice young people hoping to follow the " famous " Elias Kane into battle , to win some of the glory that fate had sent his way ? He wished he could give them whatever they thought he had , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cassiodorus were diverting beta-steel ore , and if they managed to build dreadnoughts , some of these proud , eager young faces would not get much older . Elias reached the end of the line , an older face  --  the sergeant ? scarred on both cheeks in the telltale pattern of an Andinaz pincer . No awe in this face . The scars made Elias think of Richard DuMorgan . Only a few men had ever gotten that close to an Andinaz and lived ; DuMorgan was one of them . Elias felt a pang of sorrow thinking of the terrible loss : DuMorgan had been the empire 's brilliant and stalwart ally . As its foe , he would be the very devil to defeat . " Thank you , Sergeant . Usmet danaar . " The man 's eyes focused on him with surprise and a new respect .  | " Unmet gheraal , sir , " he responded , promising in the Andinaz dialect , to " keep his charges well . " Elias turned and found Streatham right behind him , his face unreadable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone after your gear in the shuttle . If you 'll follow me , I 'll show you your quarters , then get us under way . " Streetham led them along the corridor . Elias fought the tendency to lean into the continual , slight upgrade . At the same time , ahead , the bulkheads and doors rose straight off the curvature , seeming to lean into him . He knew there was no escape  --  wherever you stood in any ship 's corridor , it would rise behind and ahead of you . He was aware suddenly that he was spinning , head to the core of the ship , feet pressed outward , only the hull between him and a long , tumbling fall into eternity . His stomach lurched and he swallowed . Relax . It 's just like gravity , except it 's always straight down through your body . Meanwhile , just keep your eyes on your feet until you acclimate . He said , " How long do you plan to take getting to Cassiodorus , if I may ask . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streetham said in a neutral voice . " My orders make that quite plain . A week would be most economical on the Opperman drives . But I presume you 'd like to get there faster . " " Yes , " Elias said shortly , tired of Streetham 's bland coyness . " Two jumps minimum , " Streetham said . " I could have us there in eighteen hours , but ? " " That 's not necessary . I imagine you 'd want to go subspace around the Freytag Anomaly and again around the yC-238 farther out . That would still get us there in less than forty-eight . " Streetham cast a surprised look over his shoulder , and Elias felt a small gratification , then was annoyed at himself for showing off . Briana 's orders gave him virtually the powers of an onboard admiral . But  --  even for an attending admiral  --  on all matters concerning the ship in space , the captain ruled . Though Streetham would risk the Imperator 's wrath later , he could still refuse or countermand any order Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of baiting him . " Whatever you think best , Captain , " Elias said . " Thank you , Mr. Kane . Here we are . " Streetham ducked through an oval bulkhead , leading the way into a two-room suite with head between . There was a bunk , a desk and two chairs in each half of the duplex . The rooms were spacious even for a battleship . Though bare of  | personal items , they held a lingering aura of warmth , an indefinable lived-in feel . Elias realized with a twinge of guilt that he had probably displaced two lieutenant commanders . A simple closet with bunks would have been more to his liking , but it would have been a serious breach of manners to protest . " And here is the G-dial , " Streetham said , fingering a knob on the wall . " This suite doubles as one of our acclimatization berths . You can get up to 1.5 max . Of course , if you like , I can get you beyond that with increased spin . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elias understood  --  and approved . The outer shells of a warship were , in general , like the belowdecks of ships of old . Only a scattering of officers quartered there ; the vast majority were bottom rankers . It would n't inconvenience Streetham or his circle of officers that dwelled in the weightless hub to throw on extra spin . But he cared enough for his men not to want them put under extra physical stress just for two passengers . " I 'm sure that wo n't be necessary , Captain , " Elias said . " Temporary extra weight wo n't help us that much . When we hit planetside , our knees are going to buckle , one way or the other . " Streetham looked relieved . " As you wish . If you need anything , do n't hesitate to hail me on the box . The legion 's under Colonel Teegarten . I 'm sure he 'll be by to pay his respects . If there 's nothing else , I 'll get us under way . " " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosun appeared with their gear . Elias stashed his quickly under his bunk and paced while Pendrake , with his customary butler-like care , put away his own things . Elias watched the acceleration warning light over the door with growing impatience . The shuttle must have cast off by now . What was Streetham waiting for ? Was this a little lesson to his VIP passengers ? I 'm captain , and this ship moves when I say . Elias realized he was chafing and tried to put Streetham out of his mind . The man seemed decent and solid enough . Obsessing over him was just a pathetic attempt to bury unsafe worries with safe ones . He felt the weight of depression settling in again . Even the unimaginable , sundering span of a paraspace jump was n't going to wipe from his heart his last act with Martha . He settled heavily onto the cot , then forced his back straight , determined to throw off his oppressive gloom . What he had done , he had done for Martha . The last thing she needed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be so easy for Briana  | to arrange an accident for her while he was away . Ile did not want to return to Earth to find Martha dead in a flitter accident or a plunge down a " malfunctioning " dropchute. lie thought of the baboons in her lab , brought in for experiments in the grisly new science of maintaining Amerdath 's head apart from his body . He was struck by a horrible image of Martha lying on the floor in a pool of blood , one of the cages standing open . A sad-faced Briana : So sorry , Elias , but she must have neglected to latch the cage . We 've had the animal destroyed , of course . He shuddered . " Are you all right , Elias ? You look ill . " He looked up at Pendrake and forced a grin . " I 'm fine , oh legendary one . " Pendrake gave him a vexed grimace which quickly faded to a look of concern . " I think you are not fine , Elias . I saw what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was a noble , unselfish act ? and it must pain you a great deal . " Elias felt embarrassed  --  and better . He waved Pendrake off . " I promise not to call you legendary if you wo n't call me noble . " Pendrake remained sober . " Perhaps it would be best to let yourself experience the pain now . " With a twinge of irritation , Elias realized what he was saying . Get it out of your system , because once you hit Cassiodorus , you ca n't afford to have it messing up your mind . " I 'm all right , " he said . " Do n't worry , I plan to keep my mind on our work . " Pendrake looked dismayed . " I did not mean it so crassly . " Elias softened , touched by his concern . " I know you did n't , my friend . " " Just what is our work on Cassiodorus to be , Elias ? This has arisen so suddenly , I am not entirely sure what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial inspectors , all dying of heart failure before they could file their reports ; Briana 's suspicions that a rebel faction might be siphoning off ore . Pendrake nodded thoughtfully . " We have discussed this issue of dreadnoughts before , " he said . " Yes , and if I recall , you seemed sympathetic to the colonists . " Elias was stricken suddenly with concern . In all the rush and his inner turmoil about Briana 's pregnancy  --  and then his misery at hurting Martha ? he had not considered how the mission would affect Pendrake . He 'd just assumed Pendrake would be with him emotionally as well as physically . But Pendrake was no man 's lackey . The realization that he had  | come close to treating him as one filled Elias with dismay . i le rose , putting a hand on I'endrake 's shoulder . " Is this going to cause you problems ? " Pendrake gave him a melancholy smile . " The whole issue of dreadnoughts causes me problems , Elias . I do not wish that the colonists had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I understand . But Earth does  --  and has for several decades . And in all that time , she has never used them against the colonies . " " Only , I think , because she has not needed to . " " Exactly . But if the rebel factions get a few dreadnoughts , I can promise you that Earth will need to . " " What makes you so certain ? Do the colonists not say that they want the dreadnoughts only to defend themselves against attacks such as the Andinaz raids ? " " The ' viceroy ' governments , yes , all of whom are  --  at least in theory  --  still imperials . But those same viceroys have no way to guarantee that any dreadnoughts given them could be kept from rebel hands . The planetary defense navies are no doubt infiltrated with rebels biding their time . Make no mistake , my friend . No matter what the viceroys say , if the rebels get dreadnoughts , they 'll attack Earth . " " But why should they ? " Elias remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some ways , smarter than you . But for centuries , his entire race has had a horrified aversion to violence in any form . So do n't expect him to understand the fine points of modern naval warfare . Elias said , " It 's a matter of strategy . Three things have happened in recent history to revolutionize modern interstellar warfare . The first two were the synthesis of beta-steel , and the discovery of paradoxical space which was inferred from it . The third was the discovery that , because of its size , a dreadnought armored in beta-steel goes an order of magnitude faster through a paraspace jump than any other ship . " The way this has revolutionized warfare is in breaking down the distinctions between offense and defense . The blinding speed of a dreadnought in paraspace means that , if a hostile ship appears off a colony planet , an imperial one can strike it and return to a defensive posture off Earth in hours . Which means that most of the imperial fleet can remain near Earth at any given time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cassiodorus to make our fleet of ten dreadnoughts . So even if the colonists have diverted ore , they could n't have enough for more than two dreadnoughts at the most . Even so ,  | each one of them would he a potential 1 ) 1nni  --  t killer  --  and that planet is Earth : It would do the colonists no good to have those dreadnoughts , then spend all their time in deep space trying to avoid contact . As long as the imperial government exists , they will not think themselves free . Their best  --  and only  --  chance for victory would be to try to jump in close enough to strike Earth before the surrounding fleet could stop them . Their chances would be better than I like to think about . " Pendrake looked grim . " So much pointless savagery . And you are all brothers . Could n't this be resolved if Earth simply relinquished her governance of the colonies ? " Elias became exasperated . " Damn it , now you sound like a rebel propagandist . Understand this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , which finally imposed world government in 2041 . U.S. history prevails  --  in the thinking of Earthmen and colonists alike  --  all the way back to the founding of the nation , when the U.S. colonies defeated Great Britain in the revolutionary war . Thereafter , U.S. government was never overthrown by internal revolution , but rather changed by gradual evolution . " So , to portray themselves as heroic revolutionaries , the colonists see only one model  --  that first " glorious " revolution against the English . They consider themselves the new Nathan Hales , Paul Reveres , Thomas Paines . Give me liberty or give me death . " But there are two problems with this : First , Earth has not denied personal liberty , human rights or any other democratic privilege to the colonists . Colonists live under exactly the same laws as Earth citizens ? who also , incidentally , are not allowed to have their own personal dreadnoughts . Earthers and colonists are taxed at the same rate and enjoy all the same privileges of movement , assembly and economic selfdetermination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the empire , can in no way be compared to the old tyrant King George III . " Elias realized he was working himself into a high dudgeon but was unable to stop . It felt good to raise his voice , get steamed up . " Second , there was n't just one revolution in U.S. history , there were two . The colonists have conveniently forgotten the other one  --  the U.S. Civil War . ' It was , in fact , an attempted revolution that failed . And it was a damned good thing for U.S. civilization that it did . " " I have read somewhat on that part of your history , " Pendrake mused . " And I would certainly agree it was a good thing that the revolution  --  or rebellion of the slavers  --  failed . Slavery was a terrible  | moral wrong , and its defeat was necessary to the advancement of civilization . But the colonists do not advocate slavery . " Elias gave him a look of mock surprise . " Interesting that you , of all people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , it is true that the slavers who abducted me from Cephan and sold me to Spencer Hogate were colonists , but it was not lawful . " " Slavery is not the issue now , and it was actually not the predominant issue then . The real issue is the same in both cases . The rebels ? then and now  --  do n't want the central government telling them what they can and ca n't do . " Likewise , we must resist the rebels now for the same reasons we did then : the obligation of a fair and evenhanded government to keep all its people moving forward together . If the Unionists had failed , the United States would have broken into fragments . The principle of secession , once established , would in all probability have been reenacted over and over until the former nation consisted of dozens of splinter fiefdoms ripe for plucking by hostile powers . " Pendrake looked thoughtful . " And now you see the alien cultures your species has encountered in space as the current hostile powers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe except for us were peopled by Cephantines , there would be no problem ? " " Except , perhaps , for the Cephantines , " Pendrake said drily . Elias felt himself flushing . " All right , smart ass , you zinged me that time . If it 's any comfort , I 'd be on the Cephantines ' side . " " I know that , Elias . " " But in our universe , Cephantines are  --  sadly  --  the exception rather than the rule . You 've seen what Ornyl warriors can do . The Moitan are contesting us on planet after planet  --  so far , with their slippery diplomacy , but who knows how long that will last ? Remember , they supplied the rebels with the device that almost brought down the palace and toppled our government . And the Andinaz have already had a crack at us . Against them , Gregory Amerdath and Earth 's dreadnoughts fought side by side with Richard DuMorgan 's planetary navy ? the colonists , mind you  --  to repel the Andinaz attack off Alpha Centauri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DuMorgan would have lost  --  and Earth itself might have been next .... " Pendrake held up his hands . " I surrender . You are most persuasive . "  | Elias caught his breath and grinned ruefully . " Sorry . I did n't mean to get on my soapbox . " Pendrake gave him a baffled look and he laughed , feeling energized , almost good . Pendrake had made him forget Martha for a moment , his miserable leavetaking from Earth .. . . " You fnip , " he said , realization dawning . " You were just playing devil 's advocate . " " No , " Pendrake said gravely . " You told me things that I had not considered . I am grateful . " Elias gave an ironic bow , thinking , I 'm the one who 's grateful . His eye caught a flash of red  --  the acceleration warning . " Here we go , " he said . " Looks like Streetham plans a little sublight maneuvering before we jump . " Pendrake sat beside him on the bunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " About time , " Elias added , feeling a queasy jolt of anticipation in his stomach . He felt his back pressing into the cushion as the Seraphim accelerated in a long , smooth leap . He wished suddenly that he had opened the port at his feet  --  he might have been able to catch one last look at Earth  --  but then the acceleration stopped and the air crackled with a glitter of electron displacement . He had the familiar , brief sensation that everything around him had jumped a fraction out of kilter , and he knew that Earth was no longer outside his window . Depression settled briefly back on him , but he shook it off , determined not to succumb again . Pendrake stood . " I still have some things to put away . If you will excuse me ? " The signal above the door pinged . Pendrake gave him a questioning look . " Probably the marine colonel , " Elias said . " Teegarten . Would you mind ? " Pendrake pushed the release and the door slipped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dumbstruck , as Martha Reik stepped over the low sill into the cabin .  | " I CAME UP FOR THE REST OF MY KISS . " MARTHA GAVE him a rakish grin . Elias felt a surge of exhilaration . He covered the deck between them in one step , sweeping her into his arms , wildly happy to see her . So this was why they 'd taken so long to move out  --  Captain Streetham had had to wait for Martha heading up behind him in a second shuttle . I get another chance ! Elias thought . But why ? He gave the kiss everything he had , tasting her minted lipstick , filling his head with her rose petal scent . Her tongue darted mischievously , causing his heart to lift and race . He flushed , aware suddenly of Pendrake . But he was damned if he 'd pull away from her again . Instead he clutched her rump with exaggerated lust , making her push off with a little gasp . " Sorry . I 've been in space too long without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two hours ? " He sobered . " A very long time , when you know it will only grow longer . I did n't like the way we parted . " Her eyes misted . " I understood . " Elias glanced at Pendrake , but the dusky orange face looked distant with daydream , offering privacy . Elias was grateful for the sham , but changed the subject anyway . " Briana sent you . " Martha nodded . " She had another shuttle waiting . The minute you took off , she ordered me into it . She 'd even packed a bag for me . Probably two months ' worth of praetorian underwear . " " Or a chastity belt . "  | Pendrake 's pose of detachment broke with an embarrassed cough . " If you will excuse me , I believe I will finish unpacking . " Martha winced . " I 'm sorry , Pendrake . We forgot there 's a gentleman present . " Elias gave a wounded harrumph and Pendrake smiled . " It is good to have you with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ; the alien gave a little bow , then slipped from the room . Elias gazed at Martha , suddenly uneasy . " What reason did Briana give you ? " " A pretty good one , actually . The previous inspectors died of stroke or heart failure , supposedly because of the sudden exposure to the heavy-G environment . I 'm being sent along to inquire further into the medical circumstances of the deaths and assess whether Cassiodorus is really so brutal to the unacclimated . After all , my background is in medical research . " " Makes sense , " Elias said . " Yes . " " But so would legs on a snake . " " Huh ? " " Briana 's deliberately putting you in danger . " He felt a growing , indignant anger . " Briana said you 'd be upset  --  that you would n't want me along . That 's why she waited and popped it on us both like this . " Elias took her hands . " She was wrong . I do want you along . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King David : He wanted the wife of one of his soldiers , so he sent the poor devil to the front lines of a murderous battle , knowing he 'd be killed by the enemy . " " So we 'll be careful , look after each other . " He made an effort to put aside his paranoia . " That last part sounds rather pleasant , " he said . " Yes . " Martha placed his hands on her waist , held them there . He squeezed gently , delighting in her smooth , lean flesh , his heart beginning to race , his breath shortening in anticipation . She gave him the lopsided smile he loved , her face warming with that familiar , unfathomable beauty that so beguiled him . " Is the door to Pendrake 's quarters locked ? " she whispered . " No , but it might as well be . " He pulled her to him , filling with a tender hope . I want to love again , he thought . I want to love you . Her hands busied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling as their hands and wrists brushed , until she stood before him as naked as he . I Ier skin was pale , lightly freckled along her forearms and above her breasts . Seeing this part of her for the first time enchanted liini , the little mysteries of her flesh , making him wonder suddenly what she wanted  --  from him , from her life . Then his ability to think vaporized in pleasure as he let his hands travel her body , drawing waves of excitement deep into him  --  ah , that 's /l ice ! Ile pulled her onto the narrow cot with him , feeling enclosed and protected by the upper bunk overhead . The universe contracted to Martha , her heat , her dizzying , secret smells , her hands roaming his back and flanks , pulling , pressing . So warm , soft , wanting him as he tried to get deeper , reaching , feeling her wanting him , yes , yes ! Distantly he heard her little cries growing , filling with a rapture so greedy that it silvered her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back , his rump , striking sparks of agonized pleasure where the praetorian had kicked him . He clung to the last scrap of control , clamping his teeth to keep from shouting as she goaded him to explosion . IIe floated in well-being . He realized that he was lying on top of her , the length of her body cushioning him . He made an effort to roll off , but she held him in place . " You 're not too heavy , " she breathed into his ear , her moist breath sending an aftershock of pleasure down his spine . She ran fingers along his ribs . " In fact , you 're not heavy enough . How much do you weigh these days ? " " Same as always , Doc , " he mumbled . " Then why are your clothes so loose ? " " It 's the new look . Baggy . " Thinking was still an effort , even to joke . Ile had not felt this viscerally content in a long time . " New look , uh-huh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as long as I 've known you . How 's it manage to keep up with current fashion ? " " Maybe Pendrake 's trying on my clothes when I 'm out . " She laughed and gave up , turning onto her side , inviting him to nestle , spoon fashion . He fitted his body against her without desire , enjoying instead the comforting softness and warmth of her . He thought about how he 'd lost the weight going into a depression after Beth . Odd that it had n't happened right away , not while he was still after her killer , but afterward , when there was nothing more to be  | done . Long time ago  --  or beginning to seem that way . Was that all right ? Yes . Elias felt a drowsy sense of wonder . Got ta get those pounds back . Eat , drink and he , if not merry , at least less morose . In fact , I 'm hungry right now . Too nice to move . Lie here . . . few more minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . g .. . When he awoke , Martha was gone . Elias stood in the shuttle bay with Captain Streetham , staring with fascination at the huge , red ball of Cassiodorus that nearly filled the launch controller 's viewport . The sunside crescent of the planet gleamed like a gaping , bloody mouth , sending a shiver of foreboding through him . " That 's a pretty high albedo , " he observed . " Highest I 've seen , " Streetham agreed . " The soil is highly viscous ? basically wet clay . But it 's brighter even than most water planets because the terrain is pretty flat , no wave troughs to scatter reflection . Get used to that red color . The atmosphere down there 's so thick it reflects the red back down too . They tell me that , most days , the sky looks like blood . I do n't think I 'll be needing my new K-scope on this planet . " Elias realized Streetham was talking about the new , homeotropic " bloodhound " devices developed by the navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nights are better , " Streetham went on . " Especially when their green moon , Reseda , peeks through the overcast . " Elias 's nose began to itch as the antigrays of the shuttle pitched up into the subaudible range , vibrating his nasal septum . The craft was ready , Pendrake and Martha were waiting inside , and yet he lingered , staring down at the grinning hemorrhage in space . It repelled him even as his psyche sensed the pull of its crushing gravity . He did not want to go down . The journey on the Seraphim had been too brief after all . With the last barrier broken , he had made love to Martha , again and again , touring her body until he knew it better than his own . Pleasure , yes , rapture . And a startling truth dawning : that he did want a child , very badly . Briana 's pregnancy had pushed that into the open . But how impossibly complicated it all was . With Martha it would not be . He liked Martha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thought he could , by some fantastic alchemy , switch the new life growing in Briana 's womb to Martha 's . He  | kept seeing himself ' holding a baby in his arms , protecting it while it slept , kissing its round downy cheeks , aching with love and awe . I le found himself grimacing in exasperation . This is how he 'd prepared himself for his mission , not with hard thought and planning , but with feverish coupling and endless reveries about babies . Staring down at Cassiodorus he was stricken by a sudden , dread certainty . I 'm going to die down there . I I is mind focused with a sudden , painful clarity . Was that what wanting a child was all about ? Just having someone with his genes to carry on after he was gone ? If so , then he was unworthy of a child . No , he thought firmly . I want it to love . But he knew it was both . Streetham coughed discreetly . Elias turned and offered his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do more , Mr. Kane . But the trip was a bit rushed , and we barely saw you . " Was Streetham being sly ? His face was poker straight . " You were better off without me in your way . " " We 'll try to stay out of your way too , Mr. Kane . But I 'm sending a portable subspace radio along with you . Neues Eisen is near their equator , so we 'll keep an easy geosynchronous orbit right above you . I 'm sure you 'll be fine  --  but we 'll be up here if you need to hail us . " Elias gave Streetham a grim smile . " Very good , Captain . I believe we understand each other . " Martha took his hand after he 'd strapped in beside her in the shuttle . He squeezed her fingers with a reassurance he could not feel . The shuttle burned quickly down the fierce gravity well , skipping and planing through the thick atmosphere before finally settling on the pad outside Neues Eisen with a barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and almost collapsed . Monstrous weight crushed through him , every cell dragging him down , bending his bones toward the center of the planet . He felt Pendrake 's hand under his elbow and waved him off , wishing a second later that he had n't . Even the damned air seemed heavy . He gasped , sucking it in with a huge effort , feeling it slide down to his lungs like warm sand . The second step and the next breath were marginally less torturous . He strained to hold himself back from tumbling forward . If he stumbled in this gravity , his head would crack open like an egg on the concrete at the bottom of the ramp . At last he stepped down the last few centimeters onto the flat apron of the landing pad . A small delegation  | awaited them ; beyond , he could see the squat skyline of Neues Eisen , rajinate of Cassiodorus. lie forced himself forward , his feet scraping the pavement , feeling the heat penetrate the soles of his boots . His face was slimy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was squat and bearish , his legs slightly bowed . His grip was powerful . " Welcome to Cassiodorus , Mr. Kane . I 'm Granit Holz , special assistant to the viceroy . " Elias managed to mumble introductions to Pendrake and Martha . He could see the strain on Martha 's face , but she was holding herself straight . Only Pendrake , with his immense reservoirs of strength , seemed unaffected . Of course  --  he was born on a heavy-G planet . But not like this . God , this heat , the weight . How could anyone doubt that men could die from heart failure here ? Elias stifled the thought . He could not be objective at this point . " We try to keep welcoming ceremonies brief here on Cassiodorus , " Holz boomed . " I hope you understand . " Elias gave a nod , forcing his head back up with an effort . Just let me lie down , he thought . And put a flower on my chest . Holz ushered them to a ground car . The seat molded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost brought tears to his eyes . Holz chattered with animation as the chauffer drove them along a rulerstraight road flanked by featureless , rust-colored flatlands . This close , the shine of trapped water was not visible ; the soil looked like ordinary clay . They entered the outskirts of the city and Elias forced his mind to work cataloging his impressions : There were other groundcars , but only a few people walked the sidewalks . He was struck by how straightbacked they all carried themselves , as though afraid the slightest hunch would allow the hideous gravity to snap them down onto their faces . The buildings were low , which was natural enough in such a crushing gravity . But the architecture was more severe than it needed to be  --  tan , boxlike buildings that offered no solace to the eye . The cross streets were equidistant , the city squared off into an unvarying grid . Functional , but without aesthetic value . Neues Eisen  --  New Iron . Already he hated the place . The groundcar emerged into an open square , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squat , geodesic dome sat in the precise middle of the square . From its base , a dark semicircle beckoned them . The driver jockeyed their groundcar into it , plunging them into the welcome dimness of a long , igloo-type entry portal . They emerged  | Into a soft - lit interior that arched gently above them . The car stopped at once . The doors popped up like bent wings and cool , air-conditioned air bathed Elias ' face . 1e found he could push up easily from his seat . Thank God ! The dome was gravity controlled . I Iolz hounded out of the car with almost spastic spryness and Elias realized the man must spend little time in gravity suppression . " This is the acclimatization center , " the viceroy 's assistant said . " I 'll take you right to the water tank . " Elias ' relief disappeared . " Water tank ? " " Total immersion for four hours . We 've found it 's the ideal way for off-worlders to adjust quickly . If you 'll follow me , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze of corridors . The walls and ceiling were composed of small ceramic tiles . But the opportunity to create mosaic patterns had been squandered . Every tile was the same color  --  a slick , gleaming yellow . Elias felt a sharp annoyance. 1 low hard would it have been to set some pleasing pattern into the tiles ? Ile felt like stopping Holz , demanding an explanation , then realized that his annoyance was really transmuted fear . Water tanks , no one had told him , and he did n't want to . He was afraid , damn it ! His brain swirled with agitation , imagining tons of water pressing down on him . The ocean , yes , crushing at the dome of Spencer Hogate 's hopter , trapping him and Pendrake inside , and then the shark nosing around , waiting to tear at his suffocated body . . . . Elias realized he was gulping air , turning light-headed with panic . I Ie forced the air from his lungs , made himself walk ten steps before breathing . His heart steadied a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any water tank . " Here we are , " Holz said cheerily , ushering them into an anteroom . A technician in a white coat turned and nodded at them . Beyond him Elias could see a heavy door . A porthole in its center writhed with drifting , spiderwebby patterns of light . He could sense the tons of water beyond . His throat went dry with fear . The technician handed him a swimsuit and an oxyplex headmask with a built-in watermike and earphones , then passed out similar kits to Holz and the others . Elias wanted to drop his and run from the room . " I 'll go in with you the first half hour , " Holz was saying . " I think you 'll find the acclimatization tank quite ingenious . It gives your body a chance to work against extra resistance without having to simultaneously bear up under the added gravity of Cassiodorus. "  | But are n't most of your buildings gravity controlled ? " he asked Holz . " Many , though not all . But I presume you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you hope to inspect our mining operations . " " Of course not . It 's just that . . . " Elias swallowed against the knot of fear in his throat . This was ridiculous . He had n't even known he 'd become afraid of water . Without consciously avoiding it , he 'd managed never to go back into deep water  --  not since he and Pendrake had found themselves at the bottom of the Atlantic in that sabotaged hopter . Elias followed Holz and Pendrake into a change room . He could feel his heart pounding as he put on the suit . Holz helped him pull on his oxyplex mask , cinching the chinstrap back around his neck beneath his earlobes . For a second Elias felt he was choking , then the strap selfadjusted to his jawbone , molding into the crevice of his neck to complete the seal . His sinuses cleared ; he felt a heady lift and knew the oxyplex was filtering out everything but pure 02 . When he entered the tank , it would go on drawing oxygen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that was the way it was supposed to work . Elias felt sweat building up between his face and the mask . Martha was already waiting in the anteroom . She gave him a questioning look . He bugged his eyes out and rowed his hands in front of his face like fish fins . She laughed and his terror eased a bit . Holz led them through the door into the lock . " Here we go ! " he said . The earphones mercifully reduced his booming voice to an insectile buzz . A dozen valves opened along the base of the chamber . Warm water gushed around their ankles , rising quickly to their knees . Elias stared at it in dread fascination as it climbed his chest . He felt himself straining up on tiptoe , angling his chin up , gasping as the water closed over his head . He realized that his watermike was broadcasting his panicked breathing to the others . Holz was gazing at him through the clear water , a trace of smile showing through the plastic of his rebreather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start out this way , panicking in front of the people he 'd come to investigate . They probably had little enough respect for Terran imperials as it was . They 'd have none at all for him unless he pulled himself together now . The inner door of the lock inched open and Holz stepped through , motioning them to follow . Elias noticed that he could walk with no  | tendency to drift up . The tank must be under planet-normal gravity , giving them sufficient weight to decrease the buoyancy water would give them on Earth . He followed Pendrake and Martha through the crystal water into the main chamber . It was walled in the same uniform yellow tiles as the corridor . Elias pulled himself along with sidestrokes of his arms . Each motion required extra effort from all of his muscles ? but not as much as walking down that ramp from the shuttle . Elias began to feel a grudging respect for the idea of the tank . " Why do n't we sit for the first half hour , " Holz said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll brief you a bit on Cassiodorus , then give you some exercises we 've found helpful in preparing your muscles . " Elias settled onto the bench beside Holz , finding he could sit back comfortably . Martha sat across the tank with Pendrake . Her slim body stirred echoes of arousal in him . . . find that if you 're careful , " Holz was saying , " the planet will not present insurmountable dangers . But I must emphasize the word careful . Cassiodorus is not a hospitable planet . Besides the crushing gravity , the wastelands outside the cities offer many other nasty surprises to the unwary . The one most to be avoided is an indigenous life form we call sauroids . Very dangerous . They look like smaller versions of your Tyrannosaurus rex of ancient Earth . But they 're quicker and more clever than the old dinosaurs were thought to be . Yes , immensely dangerous . . . " " What do they eat ? " Martha asked . Holz grinned . " You  --  if they can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry retort , realizing again that it was the fear . Why was anger so much more comfortable than fear ? Because , fnipbrain , you get a lot more credit in life from fighting than from running . " I imagine , " Holz said , " your question is based on the fact that you did n't see a shred of vegetation on our way in . But farther out , there are rudimentary plants  --  enough to feed small herbivores . We have our own version of your rabbits and groundhogs , and the sauroids eat those . They will readily devour a man if they have the chance , but you should n't have to worry about them . I 'm not going to take you that far out . " Unfortunately , the main menace on this planet is far more prosaic . I refer to the air . Our continual effort to gouge beta-steel ore from the mines has adversely affected the air , I 'm afraid . The old coal mines of  | Earth had coal dust . lien. it is clay molecules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other clay in the universe . To be strictly accurate , it is n't really clay at all . The individual molecules are very small and have an affinity for water . Mining releases ground water laced with clay molecules into the lower air . Some of this brew joins the general humidity . Luckily , it 's breathable  --  what is n't exhaled , the body excretes . We 've no equivalent of black lung here . But the clay ' continually settles out of the air into machinery , where it jams gears , shorts out circuits , and fouls up everything from antigrav units to groundcars . No one flies conventional aircraft on this planet . Even though the air at normal flight levels is fine , we have n't built a hangar yet that can keep the clay from building up in the engines when the planes are on the ground . That 's why our planetary defense aircraft are all quartered on satellites . " Holz droned on . Elias lost track of what he was saying , noticing , instead , a slight itch around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew . The oxyplexed air he was breathing seemed suddenly damp , making him cough . In reflex , he covered his mouth . Despite the water , the material over his nose and mouth felt sticky , as if it were melting . Acid ? The fear began to well up in him again . He tried to gulp a deep breath , felt a teaspoon of water go down his windpipe , lancing his lungs with fire . He rose , coughing , feeling the dilute sting of acid on his lips and nose . Pendrake started to get up across the tank . Then the oxyplex sloughed away entirely and Elias felt a blinding rush of panic as the water poured in around his nose and mouth .  | ELIAS HELD HIS LAST , WATER-TAINTED BREATH , FIGHTing the burning urge to cough , knowing if he gave in , he 'd gasp more water and drown . Hang on  --  the door , you can make it ! He struggled toward the tank entrance , half swimming , half running in the high gravity , his toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dragging at his arms and legs , seeming to mass in front of him and press him back . He clamped his jaws against the souring gas in his lungs and battled the water with desperate strength , fixing his gaze on the locking wheel of the door . There  --  got it ! but his hands grabbed impotently at emptiness , his eye fooled by the lens effect of the water . He lunged forward again , grabbing the wheel at last , wrenching with everything he had . It would n't budge . He cried out in a fury of frustration , precious air springing loose in a bubbling croak . He saw Holz beside him punching a button marked EMERGENCY . Martha and Pendrake arrived a second later . Pendrake had his own mask off , holding it out like a bag , slipping it down over Elias ' head , not realizing that the inner surface was now contaminated with hydrogen , the delicate filtering valence broken . Elias felt a stab of fear for Pendrake . Now he had no air either . In agonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door stayed locked . Black spots spun , gnatlike , around Elias ' eyes . Air , please God , he had to have it ! He could feel his lungs twisting from the grip of his brain , preparing to suck their fill of water . He saw Pendrake grab the wheel and twist , saw it break off in his hands , and knew they would both die . A terrible rage swept over him . He used it to hang on a second  | longer . Through a red haze of bursting capillaries he saw Pendrake , cheeks puffed , tear away the rubber seal of the door and force his fingers into the gap ; saw the huge , orange back bulge as Pendrake tore the door from the wall . Dimly Elias felt himself tumbling on a flood of water into the lock , Pendrake 's hands under his arms , lifting him up , his lungs unlocking at last , tearing at the sweet air . Ah , God , Ah God ! The water rose almost at once over his head , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , giving him strength . Pendrake tore the outer door loose . This time the water tumbled through more sluggishly , leveling out at waist level in the anteroom then dropping further as it converged on the door and spilled out into the corridor beyond . Elias staggered forward in the wash , dropping to his knees , sucking at the glorious , clean air until he 'd had his fill . He became aware of Martha 's hand soothing his back , Holz helping him up , babbling apologies . Elias raised a hand , cutting Holz short . " No , no  --  your tank works great ! After that , your gravity will feel like free fall . " Holz peered at him uncertainly then gave a thin , hysterical laugh . " How you can almost die and then joke about it is completely beyond me , " Pendrake grumbled . Elias cackled , hearing the edge of hysteria in his own voice . He could n't help it . It was fantastic to be alive . In a moment the euphoria would pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waltzed him around in a clumsy dance . Pendrake smiled finally . " I see , Elias . Humans joke to celebrate staying alive . " " And just what d' you do on Cephan ? " " We give everything we own to the first pauper we meet . " Elias winced . " Yes , well , that was going to be my next thought . " " Damn ! " Holz said . Elias saw that he was bent over something in the water  --  not a thing , a man . The attendant 's body , face down , sloshing gently to and fro in the knee-deep , ebbing water . Elias ' manic relief evaporated in an instant . He pushed past Pendrake , who had paled at the sight of the body , and helped Holz turn the corpse over . The face stared up at him with such utter vacuity that his flesh crawled . He remembered seeing the same utter absence of expression  | on the face of a severely brain-damaged infant . I lc had never seen it before on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the face and search the body for some sign of what had killed the man . There was no blaster wound , no characteristic soft spot in a bone that might have indicated a ruptor beam . No ligature on the neck , no stab wound , no bruise anywhere on the body . ! k sat back on his heels , baffled . " Allow me , " Martha said , kneeling beside him . She grimaced when she saw the man 's face . Gently , she closed the eyes , then , with a shudder , the mindlessly gaping jaw . Elias watched her , admiring her quick thoroughness . She turned the head back and forth , looking in the ears , and he realized he should have done that  --  looked for a puncture , see if someone had rammed a wire pick into the brain . " Look at this . " She was pointing at the external canal of the right ear . He saw no puncture or bleeding , only a slight redness . She rolled the head , exposing the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was redder , as if it had been mildly abraded . Martha looked up at Holz . " Do you have autopsy facilities nearby ? I 'll need to examine this man at once . " " I 'm afraid that 's not possible , " Holz said stiffly . Elias rose . " Why not ? " He kept his voice mild . " This falls under the jurisdiction of our chief coroner . I 'm sure he 'll want to make the exam himself . " " Is there any reason I ca n't assist ? " Martha asked . " You would have to ask him . " Elias battled a quick , hot anger . He tore the remains of his oxyplex hood from his head . " Mr. Holz , we 're going to send this to your best criminology lab . When the report comes back , it 's not going to say moths . It 's going to say acid  --  a water-potentiated acid that was deliberately rubbed around the nose and mouth of the mask . The man who handed me the mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that he knew what he was handing me  --  and that someone else rewarded him by permanently pulling the plug on his voice box . " Pendrake gave an agonized grunt . " You do n't know that he was murdered , " Holz said . " The water sheeting in here could have knocked his feet from under him , broken his neck . " " It could , " Elias agreed . " But if he was alive before Pendrake broke out the door , why did n't he answer your emergency alarm ? " Holz 's mouth opened , closed again .  | " So , you see , we need to determine if he was murdered . " " I 'll arrange an immediate autopsy , " I lolz said . " I promise you 'll be told all results . " " Mr. Holz , on behalf of the Imperator , I ask that Dr. Reik be present at the autopsy . And she must be free to intervene if necessary . " Holz colored . " I 'm aware of your imperial carte blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends on this planet waving it around . " " I 'm not here to win friends . Nor am I here to become the fourth imperial inspector to die on this planet . " " All right , " Holz said stiffly . " I 'll order the coroner to do as you want . Will you be present , too ? " " No . Dr. Reik is the expert . " Elias eye-checked Martha , saw her nod her OK . " Then while she 's with the coroner , I 'll escort you to your quarters and ? " " I want to see a mine . " " Of course . As soon as you 've rested and had a chance to acclimate .... " " Now . " Holz looked at him as if he were mad . " You ca n't be serious , Mr. Kane . The mines are no place for an off-worlder who 's just landed . You ca n't imagine the harshness of that environment , the dangers every minute . As you know , the last inspector had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through the tank and a week of careful acclimatization . " " Thank you for your concern , " Elias said coldly . " Please arrange it . " " Elias ? " Martha cut herself off , and he gave her a slight , grateful nod . She could not hide the concern on her face , though . All right , he was being stubborn , perhaps foolhardy . But he was tired of Holz and mad as hell at almost being killed . He 'd use that anger , keep the adrenaline flowing , let it power his legs until he 'd shaken things up a little . Someone had tried to kill him almost the minute he hit the planet . Whoever it was must be afraid he 'd find out something fast . So that 's exactly what he 'd try to do . And he could n't do it resting in his quarters . Holz looked to Martha for support , saw she was n't going to interfere and gave a hopeless sigh . " Very well , Mr. Kane . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane . I 'll hail us a groundcar . Mine number three is p 53 close to the city . We can he there in an hour . lint I want I ) r. lieik to note that this trip is taken over my protest . I wo n't be responsible . " Elias gazed at the entrance to the mine . The air was thick and heavy , making the elevator gantry shimmer , carrying the rubbery stink of corside , used to spray-wall the shafts down below . Slick , reddish clay formed a broad mound around the gantry . At the bottom of that slope , near the groundcar , barebacked men strained and pushed at an ore carrier . The engine of the carrier shrieked like a wounded animal and Elias could hear the men cursing . In the dump cradle of the carrier , huge lumps of beta-steel gleamed like chunks of raw meat torn from the ground . The sky glowered with massive reddish clouds . Dante 's inferno , Elias thought . He levered himself from the groundcar and shuffled along the steel catwalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge fist pressing down on his neck and shoulders . Pendrake offered his hand under one elbow . " Would the inspector like some assistance ? " " No , he would not , " Elias growled irritably . " And it 's Mr. Inspector , to you . " Pendrake chuckled . " Why do I get the impression you 're enjoying this ? " " It is refreshing to be on a heavy-G planet again . My legs were beginning to go soft . " " Just like my head . " " Would you like to turn back , " Pendrake asked , his voice touched with concern . " Nothing would please me more . But I 'm not going to . " Holz made a show of waiting up for them at the elevator . Wordlessly , he offered an oxygen mask from a receptacle beside the elevator . " No thanks , " Elias said . " I 've had enough of masks for today . " " The air is very heavy and somewhat depleted at the bottom of the shaft . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke into a call box mounted beside the oxygen , and Elias was startled to hear the outback colonist dialect flowing easily from his lips : " Be the foreman about ? Would'st send him up . A moment later Elias heard a ratcheting growl from deep below and a clanking at ground level . He was surprised at the primitive quality of the equipment . This elevator looked like something out of a history  | book on the coal mines of pre-imperial Earth . Surely better stuff was available . He asked llolz about it . " Yes , it 's available , Inspector . But it does n't work in our climate . Remember what I said about the clay fouling everything ? The newer machinery , with its down-sized power components , is especially vulnerable . Anything that runs on microchips is worse than useless . If even one clay molecule suspended in this humidity infiltrates the motherboard of a modern ore truck , the thing turns into an outdoor toilet . That 's why we ca n't maintain gravity suppression in the mines , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors creaked open and Elias found himself gazing at the largest human he had ever seen . The man was only a few centimeters shorter than Pendrake and almost as broad in the back and shoulders . His face was filthy . His clothes glistened with clay slime . Holz held out his hand and the monster gripped it in a slick , bearsized paw . Holz said , " Jost . I thank thee . These be imperials . Inspector Elias Kane and Pendrake . " Elias held out his hand . Jost looked at it with contempt . " Another inspector ? Thou fool . Ye be not welcome here . " " Well , at least you 're honest , " Elias said . " I hate honesty . " Jost gave a braying laugh . " A good jest , Earthie , but I 'll still not shake thy hand . " He scowled and spat into the shaft . " And what be this aberration ? " Jost poked a thumb at Pendrake . " " I am a Cephantine , sir . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Could'st take us down , Jost ? " Holz inquired . " Inspector Kane wishes to see thy men at work . " " And if he passes out , what then ? " " I do n't need much air . " " Thou wo n't get much , either . There is n't to spare . But if gruesome agonies be what thou cravest , I can oblige thee . " Jost motioned them into the elevator . Elias felt a wave of soreness in his legs and realized they 'd stiffened up during the brief moment he 'd stood immobile . There 'd be hell to pay tomorrow . The cage dropped sharply , easing the pressure on his legs , but spoiling any relief by rolling his stomach like a ball of lead up into his rib cage . He swallowed against a tide of nausea and saw Jost smiling at him , his dark eyes glittering in the mudbath of a face . Elias pretended to study his fingernails ; Jost gave a derisive grunt .  | Elias put Jost out of his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish here ? One : Get a rough idea how much Jost and his men can mine in an hour . Tomorrow , do some multiplication by working hours and the number of mines and get a rough , estimate of how much beta-steel ore should be coming out of Cassiodorus . Extremely rough , but at least it 'll give you something to compare to the official figures . Two : Look for anything closed off , any shafts Holz or Jost do n't want you to see , any locked doors , sidelined piles of ore . Three : Stay alive ! The elevator cage hit bottom and the doors ground open with a nerve-racking screech . Elias recoiled from a blast of foul heat . He followed the others from the cage into a glistening red corridor . Stooping , Jost led the way down a low tunnel , walking on a strip of steel half sunk into the soupy clay . Elias found himself straining to see . Flares were set regularly into the shieldwall , but they were too far apart , making the tunnel glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're looking at are applied by a spraygun , " Holz said , misinterpreting his gaze . " As soon as a meter is excavated , it begins to sag . The miners spray on the support  --  a chemical called corside , which quickly hardens . Then we dig through it where sampling or direct sighting indicates ore fistulas . " Elias did not bother to say that he knew it . Jost had been right ? there seemed to be too little air for each breath . Down here , talking was a luxury . At least the damned place was n't underwater . They rounded a bend and came upon a knot of miners working at a find . Jost stopped and bellowed a greeting . Three men stood away from the wall and nodded at Jost , then gaped curiously at Pendrake . " That be a pumpkin man , " Jost announced . " And the other 's an Earthie imp with a death wish . " The other miners laughed raucously . Elias saw that Holz was watching him closely , his face impassive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on , " Elias observed . The miners beside Jost looked incredulous . " And how would'st thou know that , imp , " one of them said . " Too flat . Do n't the payload fistulas show more rounding on the ends ? " Jost cleared his throat . " Generally , yes . But there be always excep- tions . Thy master craves every scrap she can muster , so we look them all over . " Not very efficient , " Elias observed . Jost bristled . " Where didst thou learn about false plates ? " Elias ignored him . " And is n't that sample hole a little big ? " Jost stepped close , bumping him . " We know how to avoid cave-ins . Do n't need a snot-nosed Earthie inspector to tell us that . " " Get your belly off me , " Elias said quietly . Jost laughed . " Or what ? " Elias could feel the hostility all around him like an extra , savage heat . He blocked it out , concentrating on Jost 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll be vein-sucking your food through tubes . " Jost glared at him in disbelief . " Think'st thou thy pumpkin-colored friend can save thee from my wrath ? " " Pendrake is too big for violence , " Elias said quietly . He could feel his heart pounding in his chest . Jost had still not stepped back . Suddenly a loud crack split the air , echoing down the tunnel . Jost whirled away from him and stared fearfully at the wall . A second later , Elias saw it  --  a small , hairline crack in the clear shielding , growing as he watched , splitting , admitting first a trickle of clay , then a sheeting gout . Jost pushed him and he staggered back the way they 'd come . " Cave-in ! " Jost bellowed . " Run for thy lives ! "  | ELIAS FOUGHT TO RECOVER FROM JOST 'S SHOVE , STUMbling forward , arms windmilling , then losing it , sprawling onto his face . He lay there a second , numb with fear , hearing the shieldwall pop as mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get moving ! He tried to push up , but the quagmire on either side of the narrow walkway sank under his hands , then held them in a sucking grip when he tried to tear loose . Forcing his head up against the fierce gravity , he saw Holz running in wild panic toward the elevator . Then huge hands grabbed the back of his tunic and tore him from the clay , setting him on his feet . It was Pendrake , shouting at him to run . He almost did , then forced himself to turn back to the miners . All he could see was a head Jost 's . He went cold with horror  --  then realized the head was n't severed ; Jost 's body was pinned under a huge slide of clay and mud . Where were the others ? They 'd been behind him . Completely buried now , God , smothering ! Elias fell to his knees and began digging barehanded around Jost 's shoulders , frantic with the need to hurry . " Run , fool ! " Jost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elias had already glimpsed the crack , inching jaggedly past him toward the entrance . He could hear the wall cracking and groaning under the immense , shearing forces of the clay . He dug harder . An alarm klaxon began to hoot from the direction of the elevator . With dim surprise , Elias realized that he was no longer afraid . His body was light and powerful , fired with a single purpose . He felt Pendrake beside him , nudging him to one side so they could dig together . Elias gulped the  | hot , heavy air , panting like a dog . Sweat poured down his forehead into his eyes , stinging , half blinding him . Ile clawed at the mixture of mud and clay . Thank God , the stuff was sticky  --  just enough cohesion to keep it from instantly filling in . He grunted in triumph as he cleared one of . Jost 's shoulders . A huge chunk of wall plopped out behind Elias ; he felt it spatter his boots but ignored it , digging and pulling until Jost 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the edge of the walkway onehanded and pulled , his face contorting in effort . Pendrake freed the other arm and grasped Jost 's hand , pulling . Elias followed suit . Jost aided them , flexing his arms , wriggling with furious strength . With a loud suction noise , his body slid free . He leapt up with a roar and threw himself back on the hill of clay behind him . Elias tried to follow , but with Jost saved , his strength washed away in a crushing wave of exhaustion . Unable to control his legs , he staggered against the wall , sliding down in a stream of mud . He blinked furiously and wiped at his eyes . Through the clay on his fingers he saw blood . Must have torn off a fingernail . Could n't hold his hands up . They dropped into his lap , leaving him gazing dully at Pendrake and Jost . They dug like madmen , gouging out hunks of clay , hurling them behind . Three more men , Elias thought . Still trapped . He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had uncovered a head and an arm . Elias grabbed the arm and pulled , but it refused to budge . He dug a wad of clay from the man 's mouth and tried to force air in , knowing he was fighting the lung-flattening weight of the cave-in . The man 's eyes remained closed , the mouth slack . Too late  --  no , damn it , keep trying ! Pendrake finished digging out the shoulders and Elias backed off as he pulled the man free . A large slab of clay and mud came with the man 's feet , revealing another limp , slimy body . Jost dragged it out . All right , that 's two , Elias thought . Where 's the other ? The crack in the wall widened , spilling more clay and mud . Elias tried to scan the deepening red-brown mass , but his vision was too blurred , his eyes stinging badly now . Damn this sweat ! He tore his tunic off , but the savage heat did not relent . He could feel it sapping the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smothering , drowning , damn it .  | Elias dropped to his knees to dig , then found his arms clawing at the air as someone pulled him off . Jost . " Iireathest thou for these two . Pumpkin and I will dig . " Elias sprawled between the two bodies , forcing air into one mouth , then the other , until he saw the chest of one of them begin to rise and fall on its own . He groped for a pulse in the other man . Damn , none ! He straddled the chest and pumped the sternum , then slid off to breathe for him . He repeated , trying to keep up the pace , but feeling himself fall behind with each repetition . Dark spots danced before his eyes . He heard a gasp and knew the man was breathing on his own . " Yes ! " he croaked , and collapsed onto his side . The tunnel dimmed , the shieldwall flares shrinking to stars winking in a distant galaxy . A rapturous feeling of well-being flooded him , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Sounds of cracking and splitting filtered dimly into his consciousness , but they did not seem important . Air tasted like honey now , sweet . Vision going away , open your eyes . Or were they open already ? Could n't tell . And then he was walking and wondering how , trying to play along with the spastic movements of his body , swinging each foot forward in turn , wishing he could just fall down and rest . . . . little further , Elias . " Pendrake , but why was he talking from the next room ? Elias fought his way back to awareness and realized that Pendrake was supporting him with one hand and carrying one of the miners across the other arm . I 'm slowing him down , Elias thought with alarm . Digging down to his last reserves of energy , he shook off Pendrake 's hand . " ' M awright , " he growled . To illustrate , he broke into a shambling run , gritting his teeth in determination , pulling ahead . He reached the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see where Jost was . He was behind Pendrake , carrying the other two miners slung over his shoulders like sacks of flour . A huge roar sounded back up the tunnel . A shock of terror passed through Elias as he saw a solid mass of clay filling the shaft behind Jost and Pendrake , rushing down on them like congealing blood . " Hurry , damn it ! It 's going ! " He pounded the call button , heard the gears only now beginning to clank to life far up the elevator shaft . He swore with fright and frustration . Pendrake and Jost were running now ; ten meters , five , come on , come ON ! The doors screeched open and he tried to prod Pendrake in first ,  | but Pendrake snared him with his free arm and pulled him along . Jost followed , still carrying his two men on his shoulders . The doors ground back together with agonizing slowness . Hurry , damn it ! Clay spilled in , and the doors shuddered to a stop , blocked . Jost swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for the doors to pinch shut . " Go , virgin whore ! " Jost shouted . " Rise , damn thy bleeding corns ! " Elias burst out laughing . Jost glared at him . " Thou find'st this funny ? " " Definitely not . " The elevator lurched and began to climb . Elias sank to his knees , trembling , but still laughing . He waved in apology to Jost , who at first looked outraged , then began to laugh too . Pendrake snorted in disgust . " Humans . " The doors opened again and Elias pushed to his feet , stumbling out and sitting down heavily , basking in the wave of fresh , cooler air . God , exhausted , but they 'd made it ! He saw that the slope was full of miners who 'd already escaped up the main and other elevators in response to the klaxon . They milled around frantically , calling each other 's names . Jost and Pendrake laid the three men out . Two were stirring feebly . The other was very still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Jost walked to Elias ' side and knelt , giving him a hard stare . Just then Holz hurried up . " I had to get out , sound the alarm , " he said . " Someone had to do that , or we 'd have lost others . " Jost glanced up at him and Holz backed away , melted into the crowd . Jost returned his gaze to Elias . " That was a brave thing thou didst . Thou art still a fool . " Elias sensed the immense effort Jost was making to be grateful and was troubled by it . " A fool . And what does that make you ? " " I was born a fool , " Jost said . Elias offered his hand again . It was caked with clay and blood . Jost stared at it . Then took it and pumped it . " I owe thee . And I fear I can not repay . It be on my head . Be thou warned . " Elias tried to understand . A chilling dread gripped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . What do you mean , " warned ? " But he was too weary to speak . Jost sprang up and strode away . " The body was absolutely normal , " Martha said . " Except for one rather odd finding . " Elias bent over his sink , splashing cold water on his face , trying to  | rouse himself . Twelve hours of sleep . Damn , had n't his alarm gone off ? Every muscle ached , even though the guest quarters were gravity controlled at .8 C. His head felt stuffed with cotton . He wanted nothing more than to totter back to his bed and collapse again . Instead he toweled off his face and shuffled from the bathroom . The sight of Martha roused him a little . She sat in the lounge chair beside his bed , one knee hitched across the arm , proving that the slit in her stunning lavender gown was as good for comfort as for looks . He felt a stir of arousal . You take the comfort , sweetheart , he thought , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and he realized she 'd tossed off her shoes at the door to the suite . He said , " You are gorgeous . " " Thank you . " " Do n't tell me Briana packed that for you . " She laughed . " Fat chance . While you slept , I shopped . " " You were talking about the autopsy , " he prompted . " The sodium-potassium balance along the attendant 's nerves was wrong . " " Are you saying the water electrocuted him ? " Elias felt a sharp disappointment at the thought that the death might truly have been accidental . Then he realized that , if the water spilling from the tank into the attendant 's room had shorted anything electrical , the jolt would have hit all of them . " No , " he said . " Forget it . I 'm still not awake . " Martha said , " The coroner thinks it was electrocution . That the control panel shocked him before the room flooded . " " And what do you think . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel ? " She laughed . " I think you 're starting to wake up . If you 're through splashing your face , had n't you better get into your uniform ? The banquet call is in half an hour . " " Come on , come on , " Elias growled . " What do you think killed him ? " " I think he was electrodepleted . I ca n't think of any other word for it . I know it sounds crazy , and I 've never seen anything like it before . But why else would his sodium/potassium balance be so screwed up ? " Elias grunted , not sure whether to be annoyed or flattered . " I know it 's hard , " he said , " but pretend I do n't know what you 're talking about . "  | " The ratio of sodium ions to potassium ions inside a neuron changes as an impulse passes along the nerve , " she explained . " 1 got the coroner to sample nerve tissue in the attendant 's arm , leg and brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every nerve in the attendant 's body  --  including the neurons of his brain  --  had fired just before death . In the neuroelectric sense , he was completely blown out . " With a chill , Elias remembered the face of the attendant , so empty , as though the life had been torn from his body before even the cells themselves could sense what was happening . He pulled on his white tunic with the two gold circles on the cuffs , struggling to make sense of it . What kind of force could do that to a man ? " When I was working on ways to give Briana 's father an artificial body , " Martha went on , " I needed to know how to turn on a synthetic network of nerves . To learn that , I had to first study what happens when a network turns off at death . I hoped I could work backward from that . As you know , it did n't work . But one thing sacrificing all those poor baboons drove home to me was how slowly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuroelectricity of a fresh-killed body to diffuse . " Elias , we got to that attendant within half an hour of his death . There should have been something left . " " Do you think it was done by some kind of new weapon ? " " I do n't know . All I know is that the coroner insisted on putting electrocution on the death certificate . If you plan to claim the man was killed to shut his mouth , I 'm afraid no one will put much store by it . " She looked suddenly doubtful . " Hell , Elias . I ca n't swear it was not electrocution . Electricity is a strange phenomenon , and neuroelectricity is even stranger . I 'm sure this coroner has seen many more cases of electrocution than I have . " " How 'd he react to your being there ? " " Seemed glad to have me . A sweet old guy , actually . " " Then why would Holz put up such a stink ? " She shrugged . " Because Holz is a bureaucratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oxyplex ? " " No help there , either . They claim there was no acid . " Elias felt a hot flush of anger . " They 're lying . " " Maybe . But what if the killer used an oxygen acid ? Would n't all that water convert most of the hydroxyls ? "  | " Dann ! It could . " Heeling stymied and angry , Elias yanked on his pants , groaning as he lifted each leg . " Are you OK ? " " As long as I do n't have to move . " " From what Pendrake tells me , you 're quite a hero . " " I did n't think . If I had , I 'd have run out of that mineshaft so fast Ilolz would 've had footprints up his back . " " Give me a break , Elias . I adore you too much already without having to admire your modesty . " Adore . He savored the word , letting it warm him . He gave her a lewd smile . " You want immodest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unbutton his tunic again . She held up a hand , smiling . " The banquet . Remember ? " He grimaced . He did not feel like going to a stuffy dinner , making small talk with a bunch of hostile , stiff-necked colonials . But he could not refuse . The affair was not exactly in his honor  --  they 'd never unbend to that extent  --  but if he did n't go , he 'd cause a nasty scandal : Earthie Inspector Snubs Viceroy . With a sigh he pulled on his boots , trying to think if he 'd covered the autopsy completely . He remembered the mild abrasion in the ear canal and asked Martha about it . " Afraid I ca n't explain that either . Maybe he dug at a piece of wax with his finger just before he died . That 's really all it would take . There was no penetration of the eardrum , nothing was rammed into his brain . You ready ? " Elias offered her his arm . She took it with a radiant smile . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination in her fingers . He felt proud to be with her . The dinner might be a bore , but walking over and back with Martha on his arm was no small compensation . At the door , she slipped into her shoes . " I still think it was shabby of them not to invite Pendrake . " " The protocol officer knows he 's a vegetarian . I do n't think that 's a real popular lifestyle on this planet . " A militia captain  --  Martha 's dinner partner  --  was waiting outside the door . Elias greeted him politely but did not relinquish Martha 's hand . The man seemed content to trail along behind them . But at the door , Elias had to surrender her with as much grace as he could muster . He found his own seat , took up position behind it , and looked around with some curiosity at the banquet hall of Cay Endor III , Imperial Viceroy of Cassiodorus . It was almost as spartan as the rest of the  | city . Its only concessions to luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long table , and the high ceiling of the hall , intricately buttressed with dark wood in the imperial style . The flags of the nine planets hung along the ceiling , providing bursts of color . The tricolor of imperial Earth occupied one end of the hall , as protocol dictated . It waved gently in some random eddy of the air conditioners , alternately revealing the top band of blue , with its rows of stars , the featureless white middle ; the blazing red bottom third , with its gold hammer and sickle . Elias felt a small stir of pride looking at it . What did Cay Endor and the other colonists here feel ? Before he left Cassiodorus , he would know . Granit Holz , resplendant in a crimson ceremonial uniform , joined him . " Ah , Mr. ? Inspector Kane , may I convey the appreciation of the viceroy for your courageous acts in the mine . " The little speech had a forced air , and Holz did not quite meet his eye . Elias realized the man was ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so quickly . Thinking of it , he felt a twinge of contempt for Holz , then remembered what he 'd said to Martha . I did n't think , or I might have run too . She did n't realize it , but he had n't been trying to sound modest . The barest difference existed between him and Holz . He had jumped one way and Holz the other . No matter how many times it happened that way , the next time could always be reversed . That was the fickle nature of bravery . " Thank you , Mr. Holz , " he said . " But you saved more men than I did with your quick alarm . " Holz met his gaze at last , first with suspicion , then gratitude . " I 'm afraid I was badly scared . " " So was I. " " At least I kept my head enough to hit the klaxon . " Elias could see the man inwardly rebuilding himself before his eyes ? rather too fast for his tastes . He turned away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , when was Cay Endor going to make his grand entrance so they could all sit down ? The banquet hall was controlled at what felt like slightly less than 1 G , but now that his muscles had been abused , only time and acclimatization could leach out the fatigue poisons . " His Excellency , Cay Endor ! " shouted a page . Elias turned respectfully with the others , feeling a genuine interest . But the first thing he noticed was not Endor , but the creature behind him . An Ornyl ! Elias '  | heart began to race . Endor 's bodyguard , an Ornyl . It made sense , especially on a heavy-C planet . Gregory Amerdath , Endor 's mentor , had had one , so why not Endor , but what did it really mean ? Ornyl warriors were a small , close-knit group . The foul s'uniph insects were among the more exotic biological weapons controlled by them . Might this Ornyl have some connection to the s'uniphs planted aboard his scout ship ? File it for later . Elias made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cay Endor . The viceroy was short and bald . His blue militia uniform was almost ostentatiously plain , the tight breeches revealing spindly legs that could not have spent much time in the true gravity of Cassiodorus . Elias caught himself , realizing he was prejudging the man . Endor might look ineffectual , but Gregory Amerdath had trusted him to oversee Earth 's most vital colony . Endor sat , and Elias joined in with the general rustle of guests sitting around the table . In a surprisingly strong , basso growl , Endor began to welcome his " many distinguished guests . " Elias tuned him out , arranging in his mind the significant things that had happened since he 'd landed on Cassiodorus . The attack in the water tank , the attendant , dead of no discernible cause , and now an Ornyl , here on this planet . . . . and Inspector Elias Kane from the Imperial Palace itself , " Endor said . Elias saw everyone looking at him . Holz nudged him and he stood . " Your Excellency . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to say more . But everyone bent to their plates , and he realized that the first course had been served while Endor made his welcoming remarks . It was a cold salad of greens and legumes , doubtless from some hydroponics plant . He picked at it without appetite . So damned tired . If he could just go back to his quarters and have some undisturbed time to think . But he knew what would happen if he had that luxury  --  he would fall asleep again , probably for another twelve hours . He needed to think . Because it was n't just the tank , the dead attendant , the Ornyl . There was something else , nagging at his unconscious , obscured by the strenuous pace , the physical emergencies . Perhaps the most important thing , and he was missing it . Somehow he must throw off his fatigue , think , root out the part he was missing . Elias felt an arm brush his shoulder , a waiter , whisking away the salad and depositing a large steak , steaming hot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to saw at it with one of the gold knives . The meat was tender , cutting easily . When the first piece hit his mouth , his tastebuds awoke with the exquisite taste . He wolfed the meat as rapidly as he dared , answering Holz 's murmured pleasantries with equally automatic banalities . The unexpected pleasure of the steak buoyed him , loosening the deadening grip of fatigue a little-and just like that he knew what he had been missing ! He 'd been sent here to unravel a mystery : Were the deaths of the last three imperial inspectors truly accidental , or were they deliberate murder , committed to cover up a diversion of beta-steel to the rebels ? But he now saw that that was the wrong question . The question was not whether three off-worlders , unaccustomed to the brutal conditions on Cassiodorus , might drop over of stroke or heart attack . The real mystery was why the Cassiodorans did n't do the same . Those men in the mines today , four of them pushing a stalled , sixton hauler , others milling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jost 's step , even after he 'd been pinned under half a ton of mud  --  then dug out two of his buddies . Big men , and he 'd slung them over his shoulders and carried them out of the mine . All right , there was adrenaline , and Jost and his men were all powerfully built , and if it had been Earth , their behavior would have been within the bounds of normality . But this was n't Earth . This was a planet where a two-hundredpound man suddenly weighed three hundred . And never stopped weighing that . Three-hundred-pound men existed on Earth . Some of them had been heavy all their lives , years and years of building up the leg muscles , lugging the weight around . But such men did not work in mines or sling other three-hundred-pounders over their shoulders . There were limits to what the human body could endure . And somehow , on Cassiodorus , those limits were being broken . A cold chill ran up Elias ' spine . He stared down at his plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BACK IN THE WARM WATER , FLOATING downstream . A fat , phosphorescent moon beamed down on him from its bed of clouds . He was filled with a drowsy contentment , tinged with curiosity : What river was this ? Why did n't he sink down farther ? Somehow he was able to rest right on top of the water as though it were a mattress . Maybe the river was very salty . Not important . He rolled his head to either side , making out distant shorelines , trees , glowing with a pearly radiance . Beautiful , but vaguely troubling . What am I doing out here at night ? He became aware of a slight weight on his chest . Straining his neck , he tried to raise his head for a look , but the water clung to him like flypaper . At last he pulled free and saw : a baby ! Joy filled him . Tears coursed down his cheeks mingling with the water 's salt , buoying him up even higher . He could feel against his chin the soft , pudgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillowed on his belly . He gazed raptly at the moon-bathed , sleeping face and wept for joy . He became aware of a thumping sound  --  thok , thok , THOK , like an oil derrick . It grew louder , signaling the sudden nearness of the shore . Anxious , he looked to the side , and saw the derrick 's looming shape . Then it blurred into something he could not recognize-a clock . Glowing red numerals , 1:07 A.M. Someone knocking at the door . He groped his chest and stomach , regret swelling in him as he realized the baby  --  and the dream  --  were gone . His cheeks were wet . His throat hurt . Knocking , knocking . " Damn it , who ? " he snapped , then remembered he was not in  | Briana 's palace , but Cay Endor 's modest guest quarters , where there was no compusayer to answer him . " All right , coming ! " Fuming , Elias slid his ruptor from under his pillow and thumbed off the safety . When he rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muttering curses , he limped to the door and opened it , keeping the weapon hidden behind it . Jost grinned down at him . Elias stared at him in surprise , hardly recognizing him with his mask of clay and mud scrubbed away . But no one else was that big . " Dost plan to sleep the night away , Earthie ? " " Jost , it 's one o'clock . I 've only been asleep since ten . " " That be six whole hours . " Elias realized it was true . A day on Cassiodorus equaled about thirty Earth-standard hours . He 'd got back from the banquet around ten , but midnight came at fifteen o'clock , not twelve . Some of his indignation at being wakened seeped away . " I thought thou might like to see the real Neues Eisen . " Pendrake , still tying his bathrobe , materialized in the hall behind Jost . The big man whirled into a crouch , arms and fingers splaying into a combat stance . " I beg your pardon , " Pendrake said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking sheepish . " Do n't ever do that again , Pumpkindrake . " Elias suppressed a smile . At least Jost was getting closer to Pendrake 's name . The real town . This opportunity might not come again . His legs would warm up once he started walking . " So what sa'st thou , Earthie ? Be game for some amusement ? See how we miners play ? " Behind Jost , Pendrake frowned his opinion . " Does your invitation extend to Pendrake ? " Jost looked nonplussed . " Ah . . . the next time , perhaps . ' T is my treat , and I be too short for two tonight . " Elias flushed . " Sorry . " Jost waved him off with a huge paw and shot an apologetic look at Pendrake . " My pardon . We two big ones will ditch this Earthie the next time . " " No apologies are necessary , " Pendrake said . " Elias , will you still wish to be awakened at eight ? " Elias recognized the hidden message , Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . But nothing on ( : nssiodorus could be accomplished without risk . " We 'll only he a few hours  --  right , Jost ? " " If that he all you can take . " " What 's the gravity where we 're going ? " Jost looked amused , condescending . " Normal , Earthie . Ca n't afford much suppression on this planet . " The hell with it , Elias thought . I 'll take a stim . " See you at eight , " he said to Pendrake . While Jost waited outside , Elias pulled on a jump suit with padded sleeves that hid a special flat pocket . He made sure the needler inside was loaded and charged , then went to the sink and washed down a twohour stimtab . As he hurried after Jost down the hall of the guest quarters , the stiffness in his legs subsided . He felt a rush of optimism and knew it was only the chemical energy of the stimulant . But some pleasure was warranted . It appeared that Jost had decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt earlier . Elias savored the breakthrough  --  having a mining foreman in his corner could be a very big help when it came to penetrating secrets or , at the least , estimating how much beta-steel ore Cassiodorus should be producing Elias realized suddenly the full significance of where Jost was taking him : the nightlife of Neues Eisen . But there should n't be any nightlife for men like Jost . Elias felt a mixture of excitement and vexation with himself . He kept slipping into the same seductive trap , damn it . This was n't Earth . He must move that fact to the forefront of his thinking and keep it there . He would " see how we miners play , " when those same miners should be lying in their beds exhausted , gathering themselves for the superhuman demands of the next day . Elias ' excitement grew . Maybe tonight he would find the answer to the real mystery of Cassiodorus ! Jost halted at an elevator marked SERVICE . He punched a code into the access panel and the doors slid back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the escapes of the flesh . " His grin was hard , giving Elias a chill , dampening his enthusiasm . Why wo n't you use my name , , lost ? Elias offered no conversation as the elevator descended , waiting to see if Jost would speak . Jost said nothing , did not even look at him . His earlier jocularity was gone , replaced by a tense , preoccupied aura . Elias remembered Jost 's warning after the mine rescue and thought , Escapes  | of the flesh ? Or escape from the flesh ? Was Jost taking him down to some deserted subbasement to kill him ? 1 is felt the nerves of his neck and shoulders tense with alarm and battled the upsurge of paranoia . Surely there was more honor in Jost than to kill the man who 'd helped save his life . But if he means me no harm , why did n't he want Pendrake along ? Jost 's excuse of not having enough money to treat both suddenly seemed transparently false . Jost had something on his mind other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right wrist and was glad for it . The elevator opened on noise , laughter and light ; Elias felt himself sag in relief . Jost gave him a knowing smile and nodded toward the door . Elias stepped out-into carnival . The air was warm and smoky , alive with wonderful smells  --  hot rolls , peppered meat , the malt of spilled beer , the nasal bite of tobacco smoke . He drew it all into his lungs , savoring it as he looked up and down the wide , vaulted concourse . It stretched in either direction as far as he could see , alive with people , movement , noise and color . Elias felt himself surrounded by powerful , half-naked flesh  --  brawny men and muscular women , dressed in leather shorts , knee-length boots and little else . Some of the women wore halters , but most displayed their chests as casually as the men . He watched in wonder as they strode from stall to stall , jostling each other , moving with manic energy . His own legs ached  --  despite the stim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat . How could these people , strong as they were , work in the mines all day , then party in 1.5 G 's ? Elias looked above the milling crowd at the blazing marquees . The dozen or so open stalls he could see from where he stood advertised everything from food to booze , to sex . Jost punched his shoulder . " Do n't stand with thy mouth agape . Choose one and participate ! " Elias barely heard him . His gaze was captured by two men , ringed by onlookers , in a stall across the concourse . The men clenched each other 's throats in a death grip . Elias watched , shocked , as they circled , backs straining , biceps and forearms bulging with effort . Both their faces were turning a dark , congested red . Their eyes swelled wide and the tongue of one of them started to protrude . His opponent , seeing this , kicked out , trying to trip him , but his feet were braced too far back . Elias was appalled . " Why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun ? "  | The crowd of onlookers shifted , parting a little , and Elias saw a pile of bills on the ground . Last-minute bets fluttered down as he watched . The man whose tongue was out buckled at the knees . His eyes rolled up and the other man released his throat , flinging his arms wide and stepping back as his opponent crashed forward face down and lay twitching . The crowd yelled and jeered . A smaller man in black scurried forward at once and slapped an oxygen mask over the fallen fighter 's face . " See ? " Jost said . " Just a game . " Elias controlled his outrage . " A game . It would be very easy to die from that game . A crushed windpipe , collapsed carotids ? " " On thy world , yes , " Jost said . " But not here . Behold the muscles on those necks , Earthie . The frailties of anatomy thou namest are deeply armored in those men . " Jost looked at him closely . " Thou be offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll find something to thy tastes . " Jost led him farther into the concourse , through the crowd , past stall after stall . Elias kept seeing shops that offered back rooms supplied with ropes . Gaudy adds invited colonists to pair off and tie each other up . He paused at one of the bondage shops , drawn with a mixture of revulsion and fascination to the animated holo advertisements . Men binding women and women binding men ; so much rope that only slivers of flesh were visible . Total immobilization . The looks on the faces were neither pain nor ecstasy , but a sort of contrite acceptance , as though they were performing a religious ritual rather than an erotic game . " Be that to thy liking ? " Jost asked . Elias flushed , embarrassed , though there was no scorn in Jost 's voice . " No thanks . I would n't want some woman coming unraveled over me . " Jost did not smile . " Then this , perhaps , " he said , leading Elias on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both men and women , poring over racks of magazines and bolos . The predominant theme was bondage . " Does n't anyone do normal sex around here ? " " Sex ? " Jost asked , as if it were a completely new topic . " Yes . Sex . You know , what people do for fun and babies . " " Why didst thou not say so ? Thou be Earthie , but if I ask it , the finest woman here would take thee in . " " No thanks . Just asking . " With a pang , Elias remembered the dream Jost had interrupted to bring him here . " Speaking of babies , do you have any kids ? "  | " No . " Jost bit off the word . Did I offend him ? Quickly , Elias tried to soften his question . " Now that I think of it , I have n't seen any kids since I arrived . " " There be few children here . " Elias looked at him , surprised . Cassiodorus was a harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such environments , humans usually bred like rabbits , obeying the strong survival instinct programmed into their genes . As if reading his mind , Jost said , " This world be no place for little ones . " His voice was full of suppressed pain and loss ; Elias felt a sudden bond of warmth for him . " I agree . But how do you keep the population up ? " " Immigration . Each year there be enough new fools willing to come here . " Elias sensed an immense pride that Jost was trying to hide . Substitute the word heroes for fools and the sentence would ring true . Sudden shouts and cheers in the stall ahead distracted Elias . He saw that it was another of the grotesque choking matches , two women this time , circling , their faces horribly reddened and contorted above each other 's strangling hands . He turned away sickened . " It be time for a drink , Earthie . " This time there was scorn in Jost 's voice . He led the way across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low , dim-lit stall . Two huge men sat slumped over a bar . Jost grabbed the shoulders of both and yanked them backward , spilling them to the floor . They struggled up drunkenly , fierceeyed until they saw who it was . " Ye be finished anyway , lads , " Jost said coldly . They wandered off and Jost took one of the stools , motioning Elias to the other and bellowing an order for two whiskeys . Elias gazed at him , feeling unsettled , dislocated . He tried to see the man who had just talked about little ones with such tenderness , who 'd fought like a maniac to save the lives of his friends in the mine . The drinks came and Elias touched his glass to Jost 's . " Can I ask you a question ? " Jost downed half of his drink in one swallow . " Why not ? " " What are all of you trying to escape here ? " Jost gave him a dull look . " I do n't understand . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Jost . You 're too smart a man to do a gig like this without at least once in a while asking yourself why . "  | " Maybe we do n't know each other well enough to talk about that , " Jost said in a low voice . " Maybe I did n't know you well enough to save your oversized carcass yesterday , either . " Jost grimaced , as if in pain . " Thy mistake , Earthie . " " What does all this mean , Jost ? " " What dost thou think it means ? " " That you hate yourselves . " " Saurcrap . This is a frontier planet , Earthie . What 'd thou expect ? Prayer meetings ? " Elias shook his head , vexed . " I do n't want to shock you , Jost , but I 've been around a bit . I can tell my pantlegs from my fly , and I know which end of a blaster to stand on . I 've seen port on five of the eight colonies . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowdy sex and boozing to break an organ bank . So do n't try to tell me that choking each other into oblivion , or chaining each other to chairs , is normal just because thou be'est a bunch of slap-happy colonists . " Jost 's face darkened . " Be thou mocking me ? " " No , damn it . I 'm trying to get some answers . " " I do n't like thy questions . " Elias sighed , frustrated . He leaned back on the stool and sipped his whiskey . It was raw and biting , bringing tears to his eyes and a welcome heat to his stomach . Jost downed the rest of his in another gulp and ordered two more . " Were you born on this planet ? " Elias asked . Jost shook his head . " Cerulyx . " " Then how in God 's name did you acclimate to this ? " Jost hesitated . " No one ever acclimates to Cassi . " Elias gestured around him . " How many of these people spent the day working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One point five G 's , and yet they have the energy for a night on the town . What is it , Jost ? Some kind of wonder drug ? A new stimulant that somehow does n't crash you after a few days flying ? " Jost did not answer for a long time . The two whiskeys came and he downed both of them , a gulp for each , and warning bells went off in Elias ' mind . " We become strong , " Jost said softly . " Then we stay strong . " " What does that mean ? There are limits ? " Jost stood and stalked from the bar . Elias took out his card , looking  | for someone to accept payment . The barman glanced contemptuously at it and turned away , polishing glasses . The warnings in Elias ' head grew louder . Jost had said he could n't pay for two , but he was n't even having to pay for one . Elias hurried out to the concourse , then saw Jost waiting for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with an amiable smile . " I 'm sure there is . And most of it , you 're not going to show me. " " post want to go home ? " Jost asked with mock solicitousness . " I guess I 'm not like you and your comrades . I need rest . Nasty habit , but I ca n't seem to break it . I have the feeling it might be healthier than more of this . " Jost shrugged with elaborate unconcern . " Follow me then . " Elias could see the tension in the huge body , the abnormal , stiff drop of the arms , the set of the shoulders . You 're a very bad faker , Jost . " I think I can find my own way back . " Jost shrugged again . " Thanks for the whiskey . " Elias turned , feeling a warning itch swell along his spine . He got two steps before Jost grabbed him . Adrenaline slammed through him . Bastard , I knew it ! He bucked hard but Jost had his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward instead of lifting him , and the floor stopped his heels . Elias shouted for help . No one looked at him . He glared at the crowd around him with a mixture of fury and fear . " Damn it , somebody help me ! " " Do n't lose thy dignity , " Jost murmured . Elias struggled but Jost kept his grip easily , dragging him backward through a door into darkness , cutting him off from the noise , people , laughter  --  from his last hope of help . Elias ' fury fled , leaving only the fear  --  and a bitter regret at his own stupidity .  | THE NEEDLER , ELIAS THOUGHT . HOPE ROSE IN HIM , spurring him to an extra , furious strength . He fought Jost 's grip in the darkness , trying to squirm down inside the crushing bearhug . Big bastard had him pinned right across the elbows . But if he could just slip down enough to bend his left arm up and across , he 'd be able to trigger the holster release below his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . Damn  --  so strong ! Grip like steel Lights came on , and Elias saw two more men . His heart sank and he stopped struggling , knowing they 'd realize what he was trying to do . With a start he recognized the men  --  the same two Jost had unseated in the bar . One looked about forty . He had a red weal across his forehead . The other was younger , his boyish face incongruous atop his muscular , bullnecked body . Elias looked beyond the two men and realized they were in a service alley  --  probably for a power substation . The alley dead-ended in a wall with control boxes and a narrow exit door that must lead to the machinery . The door was shut , but maybe it was n't locked . Elias tried to goad his body into another effort , break free and get out that door  --  or smash a box and black out the concourse , that 'd bring people running . But why should anyone help him in here , when they had n't out-side ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late  --  the men were stepping forward . He saw that Bullneck was carrying what looked like a set of earphones . " Am I glad to see you , " Elias said . " Are you going to let this big lummox get away with yanking you off your stools ? "  | Elias felt Jost 's body flinch with an anguished laugh . " Thou urt truly a Mensch , " Jost murmured . " I would this did not have to be . " Bullneck stepped closer , raising the earphones , and Elias saw that there was an earpiece only on one side  --  a slim cone , shaped to fit into his ear . He remembered the mild abrasion in the ear canal of the dead tank attendant , and panic flooded him . He fought it with a fierce effort of will . " Oh , are we going to listen to music ? " " Thou art , Earthie , " Weal said . " A funeral march . " " Shut thy face , " Jost snarled . " This man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elias said . " You do n't have to thank me . If you 'll just set me down in the concourse out there ? " " Quickly , " Jost hissed . " Elias , I be sorry . " Now he says my name . Elias went limp , sagging in Jost 's grip , but Jost did n't go for it , so Elias kicked off the floor with both legs , shifting up just enough to jam the holster release against the underside of Jost 's arm . With a muted click , the needier dropped into his hand , do n't drop it ! and he groped the trigger , swinging his legs to the side , aiming for Jost 's foot , squeezing . Whup-p-p . Jost gasped ; the iron grip broke and Elias twisted free as Jost fell behind him . Elias saw Bullneck and Weal springing forward , grabbing for him . Bullneck slapped his wrist up just as he fired ; the flechettes clanged off the ceiling and rattled around the alley as Elias jumped over Jost 's writhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He twisted in a terrified rage and fired the needler into Jost 's arm , riddling it . Jost let loose , but then the two colonists had him , one grabbing either arm . He went down , cursing , his fingers stinging as the needier was torn from his grasp . They rolled him over , slamming his back to the floor , knocking the wind out of him . From the corner of his eye , he saw Jost squirming across the floor . He was awed by Jost 's strength . How could the man stay conscious and not scream ? A hand twisted into Elias ' hair and jerked his head straight , sending sparks of pain down through his eyes . They held his head still , and he knew with an icy shock of fright that they could now easily put the earphone on him . He bucked and writhed , trying to tear free . Pain spiked into his eye sockets with each jerk , until tears blurred his vision . Then he saw the needier and stopped struggling , cold with dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond it , Weal 's face blurred to insignificance . " I ought to jam this down thy throat . " " No , " Jost gasped . Elias caught movement above his head , felt a rubbery thing go into his ear . It melded perfectly with his skin , clammy and cold as dead flesh . He bit hack a panicked yell , knowing he must hang on and fight , break free , or he was lost . He gathered himself for a desperate lunge . Now ! His body would not respond . He tried again . Nothing . He could feel his arms and legs draining of strength , his muscles trembling spastically . His mind remained brutally clear . He could sense and feel , but he could not act . The muzzle of the needler receded and he felt Weal get off him . Roll away , he thought . Jump up ! But he could not . Bullneck was still squatting at his head , holding the earphone securely to his head . The cone was warming to the heat of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , slowing his heart to a leaden booming . He knew that this thing had killed the attendant and possibly the three imperial inspectors . The Cassiodorans had developed a new weapon , deadly and untraceable . Elias was sick with despair . His strength was all but gone now . He could barely twitch his hands . Stupid , so incredibly stupid . Jost warned you , but you had to ignore him . He was too honorable , you thought . But this is bigger than honor , more vital than a blood debt . The rebels are here , they 're operating on this planet . How ? Where ? You do n't know , fool . You do know they 're stealing ore to build dreadnoughts  --  only something that important could make Jost do this to you . Terrific . You know it , and it 's too late . Elias felt someone take his hand and squeeze and realized that Jost had crawled to his side . He could feel with perfect clarity the sticky blood on Jost 's hand . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . nailed me good , Elias . Fought well . Take . . . that thought with thee . " " I 'd rather take you . " Jost gave a pained , bubbling chuckle . " Thou might at that . Maybe we 'll find each other in hell . " We already have , Elias thought . He felt the room receding from him , the ceiling soaring away to a dizzying height . He no longer had the strength to talk . With distant horror he felt himself dwindling down to a spark inside his own brain . Something crashed . He saw Bullneck leap forward across his body  | as if shoved , then felt a horrible pain in his ear , the fleshy cone tearing loose . He screamed . Reality rushed back . He felt a draft sweep his face and knew that the door from the concourse was open . He struggled with all his might to get up , but succeeded only in lifting his head . Peering clown along his body , he could see Bullneck and Weal scrambling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot swung past his shoulder , then another . Elias let his head drop back , his gaze rising up along the towering figure . . . . Pendrake ! God , no ! With a fierce effort , Elias twisted onto his side . He saw Jost lying on the other side of Pendrake 's feet in a pool of his own blood , his face contorted with pain . " Take him , " Jost croaked . " Thou canst ! " Weal halted , but Bullneck kicked open the back door of the alley . Weal grabbed Bullneck before he could run out , holding him in place . Elias saw Weal swallow , and knew the man was gathering his courage to lunge at Pendrake , and Pendrake would do nothing , because Cephantines did not injure or take life . " Take him , Beelzebub curse your chicken head bones ! " Weal started forward . " Tear his head off , Pendrake , " Elias shouted , knowing it was hopeless . With a deafening , animal roar , Pendrake sprang to meet Weal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the hackles on his neck . Pendrake ? God ! Weal fell backward , spun to his knees and scrambled out the rear exit behind Bullneck as the terrifying roar came again . Elias looked at Jost , trying to pin down the nerve-shredding sound , still not believing Pendrake could have made it . Jost 's face was white with fear . He gazed wide-eyed at Pendrake 's back . Pendrake whirled back , teeth bared in a feral snarl , his face distorted with murderous savagery . Jost held his palms up in surrender . Elias stared at Pendrake , stunned . The horrible snarl vanished from Pendrake 's face and he bent over Jost . Jost shrank back . " Do n't touch me ! " " But you are bleeding , " Pendrake said . " You have been injured . I must get help . " He turned to Elias . " Are you all right ? "  | Elias stared at him , disoriented by Pendrake 's sudden change hack to the peaceful Cephantine . " Then relief flooded him  --  followed by fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you almost killed me . " You 're falling behind on that bleeding , " Elias said . " Why do n't you lie there awhile and practice ? Pendrake , get us out of here . " " But Jost ? " " We 'll send someone after him . " Jost grunted bitterly . " I 'm sure thou will'st . Someone in an imp lackey uniform . " " It 's more than you deserve . " Elias felt Pendrake 's arms cradle his back and knees . As he was lifted up , an ugly thought occurred to him : Jost might have a backup on the concourse , in case he botched the kill . " I 'm going to play dead out there , " he told Pendrake . " Do n't worry about it . Just act sorry , like you 're carrying the corpse of your dear friend . " Pendrake put on an expression of exaggerated mourning , as though the great tragedy of the ages had stricken him . " Like this ? " " No , sadder , " Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest quarters , practicing moving his toes and trying to look down Martha 's nightgown as she bent over him . She ran her biopotentiometer over his arm and clucked in distress . " It 's the same effect I found at the attendant 's autopsy . Fortunately for you , it 's not as severe , or you 'd be dead too . Can you lift your arms now ? " Elias raised first one , then the other off his bed , then lifted his legs , too . " It 's coming back , " he said with relief . " I still think you should be in a hospital . " " I 'm safer right here in my room . There is n't a better physician than you within four parsecs . And besides , I 've got Godzilla over there to protect me . " Pendrake paced back to his bed and gave him an injured look . " Please , Elias . What I did is troubling enough to me already . " Elias tried to keep a straight face . " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it , Martha . Like a lion in an echo chamber . If my hair turns white , I 'm going to blame you , Pendrake . " " Leave him alone , Elias . " Her mild rebuke pricked him with shame . She was right . This was the closest Pendrake had ever come to doing something violent , and he needed reassurance , understanding . " I 'm sorry , friend . You saved my  | life . And I know that if your Mull had n't worked , you 'd never have hurt those men . You 'd have let them kill you first . " " Thank you , Elias . I do not doubt that either . But what if my roar , as you call it , had caused one of the men to die of a heart attack ? " And another thing : However did I manage to make such a vicious sound ? " " Maybe way back in your history , Cephantines were n't pacifists . Or maybe it 's just a prehistoric mating call ? " Elias saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must research the matter , " Pendrake said gravely , " if we ever get that vacation on Cephan . " Elias gripped Pendrake 's hand . " Right after we leave this miserable hellhole of a planet . I promise you . " Pendrake smiled . " Maybe we should not visit Cephan . If we do , you will not need to worry about someone trying to murder you . The boredom of that might kill you instead . " " He zinged me again , " Elias complained to Martha . She nodded with an air of distraction and walked to Elias ' closet , rummaging until she found a robe . As she wrapped herself in it , he gave her a disappointed look . " You would deny a dying man his last peek ? " " If you 're well enough to peek , " she said with mock severity , " I think you 're off the critical list . " " Oh , I was n't being critical , believe me . " Martha blushed . " I think you should shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if disgusted with both of them . Elias felt his relief at escaping death again fading . He began to think about the earphone weapon , and realized that trying to kill him with it did not make sense . He could understand why Jost might want him dead  --  to keep him from uncovering a rebel conspiracy in the mines . But why not just bash him on the head with a rock ? The earphone weapon would leave less sign , true , but it was still detectable . Martha 's autopsy on the attendant  --  and the exam she 'd just done on him  --  proved that . " You look pretty grim all of a sudden , " Martha observed . " I wish we 'd been able to grab that earphone . " " You mean this ? " Pendrake pulled the earphone weapon from his vest . Elias looked at it astonished . " ' You mean this , ' " he mimicked . " Get him . " I took it as soon as I entered the alley , " Pendrake explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head and assumed it was what  | had felled you . So I gave him a little push and removed it . It seemed wise to keep it . " Martha took it from Pendrake and inspected it . Elias tried to see too , then realized with pleasure that he 'd sat up . " Looks like I 'm mending fast . " Martha groped his wrist for his pulse . " Heart rate 's almost back to normal , " she agreed , looking relieved . He took advantage of her distraction to pluck the earphone from her other hand . He examined it . The rubbery , fleshlike cone that had been pushed into his ear was mounted on a standard plastic earphone base at one end of the curving headset band . He prodded the cone gingerly . His first impression from the alley grew stronger . " This is n't synthetic , " he said . " It 's real flesh . " He felt a queasy revulsion . Flipping the cone over , he looked at the reverse side of the earphone disk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damned thing . He turned it back and forth . Nothing seemed to happen . Martha took the earphone weapon back , laid it on the bedtable and opened her medical case , removing a small cylinder that looked to Elias like an outsized jeweler 's loupe , or a small opera glass . Martha studied the cone through it , then looked at him , her face grim . " It 's real flesh , all right . But nothing human . " His unease deepened . " If it 's biological , how is it preserved ? " " It 's not . It 's alive . " " You mean it 's some kind of small animal ? " " No . It 's part of an animal  --  or more precisely , a biological being . My spectral readings indicate that the base of the cone is sheared flesh . The cut surface is embedded in a wafer of solid nutrient base , which must feed the severed tissue and keep it alive . " Elias shuddered . " And somehow the thing can shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of this damned thing ? You 've got to get close , hold the victim still . " " Maybe it 's just a prototype , " Martha said . " Maybe they 've been using their enemies as guinea pigs to assess the effects . If so , you can be sure they 're working on ways to beam it at people from a distance . " Elias imagined the thing being built into a broadcaster , hidden aboard a battleship ; men and women slumping over at their posts , dying with no sound or flash of light to track back to what was killing them . He felt chilled and sickened . " I hope you 're wrong . " " We 've got to get this back to Earth , " Martha said , " where our weapons people can really study it . "  | ' ' That might not be so simple . This nasty little gizmo is like nothing the Imperium has seen . Jost will know we took it . We 've got at least several more days before we 're finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " If he 's still alive , " Martha pointed out . " Even if he 's not , those two bully boys with him ca n't have run off too far . They probably got over their panic pretty fast and went back for Jost  --  and the earphone . One way or the other , they know we 've got it . I think they 'll do almost anything to get it back . " Someone rapped at the door . Elias felt a surge of alarm , and then annoyance that his body was still so close to panic . He picked his needier up from the nightstand and pulled the ruptor from under his pillow , ignoring Pendrake 's grimace of disapproval . Shoving the earphone weapon under his sheets , he called , " Who is it ? " " Krevvy . " The cop who 'd gone looking , along with the medical team , for Jost . Elias relaxed a little , then realized it might be someone trying to sound like Krevvy . He nodded at Pendrake , tossing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . But when Pendrake opened up , it was indeed Detective Lieutenant Krevvy . He looked more awake than when he 'd answered their call , but an air of deep weariness still clung to him . Elias saw something in Krevvy 's eyes that he 'd missed in all the rush earlier : an extra gravity of untold violence ; choke matches that had gone too far , perhaps ; bondage games that ended in blood and death . Elias lowered his ruptor . Krevvy stepped into the room and Elias saw two uniformed police behind him . Krevvy said , " We went where you said and found a lot of blood but no Jost . We 're searching the concourse , stall by stall , and we 've issued bolo alerts with his pie . If he 's still in Neues Eisen , we 'll find him . " Elias glanced at the clock on his bedtable . Only four thirty-five . It seemed impossible that only three and a half hours ago , he 'd been peacefully dreaming of rivers and babies . " Very efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? " " Arrest him , of course . " Krevvy advanced into the room and looked around with casual nonchalance , but Elias could see that his eyes were sharp . " Ma'am . " Krevvy nodded at Martha , who had her hands clasped behind her back , hiding the needler.  | " Lieutenant . " " ' That ruptor , " Krevvy said to Elias . " Did you register it when you came planetside ? " " No , Lieutenant . " " Then I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask you for it . " " And I 'm afraid I 'll have to say no . " Krevvy stiffened and Elias felt a weary annoyance . The man was getting his back up , and Elias did n't want to deal with it , but he 'd have to anyway . " Lieutenant , if I could speak to you alone for a minute . " Elias nodded toward Krevvy 's two men . " Give me the ruptor , " Krevvy said , ignoring him . " And I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or for a headset , Lieutenant ? Time to step down hard . " I remind you , Lieutenant Krevvy , that I have full powers as the direct representative of the Imperator on this planet . That makes me your superior officer . So back off , or I 'll have your badge for insubordination . " Krevvy 's face went white . He reached into his V-coat . " I would n't do that , Lieutenant , " Martha said coolly . Krevvy looked at her with surprise , saw the needler she pointed at his stomach , and eased his hand away from his shoulder holster . Good move , Martha , Elias thought with admiration . " You 're making a big mistake , " Krevvy said . " You should thank her , " Elias said . " If you 'd pointed a weapon at me , I 'd have slapped you into one of your own cells on an assault rap . Now , can you accept your position , or do I have to get Cay Endor out of bed and have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change , but his shoulders sagged fractionally . Elias almost felt pity , but his acute awareness of the headset under the sheets stopped him . You want that headset , do n't you , you bastard ? Not stray weapons . And I never mentioned the headset . I just told you that Jost and two other men attacked us . So how could you know about the headset , unless you 've found Jost , or knew he meant to kill me  --  and how  --  ahead of time ? " You 're dismissed , Lieutenant , " Elias said coldly . With a last look at Martha 's needler , Krevvy turned and stalked out . When Pendrake had bolted the door , Martha clicked the safety on the needier and dropped it on the bed . Elias saw that her hand was shaking . He felt a surge of warmth and gratitude for her . " Nice work , " he said .  | She gave him a wan smile . " You should have that man arrested . " " You think he was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's only that  --  thinking . We do n't have any proof . And f ca n't see us getting any . " " But if Krevvy is what we think  --  a rebel sympathizer  --  he 'll be dangerous to you running loose . You could have him arrested on suspicion of treason and held for forty-eight hours . .. . " " Yes , and if we 're wrong about him , the Imperium will have jailed an innocent colonist  --  a public servant , no less  --  and given all rebel sympathizers on Cassiodorus a nasty little rallying point . And even if he is guilty , jailing him wo n't make us safe . What we have to do now is put that headset where no one 's going to find it . " Elias looked around the room , knowing even as he did that there could be no adequate hiding place here . The minute they were out , someone could toss the place so completely that a cockroach would n't escape . But there had to be some way .... His gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He laughed , delighted . It would be simple  --  and foolproof . " What ? " Martha said . " You still think I 'm too thin ? " She looked blank , then her face lit with understanding . " Just a couple of centimeters , " she said . She gave him a raunchy grin . " Do I get to decide where ? "  | ELIAS ' CHEST ITCHED . HE FOUGHT THE URGE TO SCRATCH it as he waited in the anteroom of Cay Endor 's viceregal office . He could almost feel the earphone pressing now against his heart . The cone of severed flesh  --  God , was it really alive ? and what if it could function in more than the ear canal ? What if it somehow activated and went to work through its encasing layers of plastiflesh , striking at the nerves of his heart ? He shuddered with revulsion . And was annoyed with himself : What 's done is done , he told himself . And it 's the perfect hiding place . Damn it , how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and paced across the anteroom , past the militia sergeant who stood at ease before the huge , gothic doors to Endor 's throne room . Elias studied the doors . They were at least six meters tall at their rounded apex . Each door was Terran oak inlaid with gleaming , gold basreliefs . Their luxury annoyed him . After the stark austerity the colonists lived in , the doors were ostentatious . The guard pulled one of the great doors open , straining against the weight of wood and gold . " Inspector Kane , the viceroy will see you now . " Elias entered , feeling the plushness of deep blue carpet under his feet . Endor sat behind a huge , ornate desk in a high-backed swivel chair . He wore a white imperial uniform , pure silk , trimmed in gold braid . Around him , the vast room gleamed in the brilliance of crystal chandeliers . Priceless paintings hung along the walls , separated by tall , narrow windows which were shuttered against the meager , reddish daylight of Cassiodorus . Elias was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | plain banquet hall and Endor 's humble militia uniform were concessions to his subjects ' sensibilities . 1lere in this office sat the true man , surrounded by the wealth of his power . Behind Endor , his Ornyl bodyguard stood with characteristic stillness . " Your Excellency . Thank you for seeing me . " Endor nodded , motioned over his shoulder . " This is Subrath . " Elias tried vainly for contact with the Ornyl 's blank , compound eyes , feeling the usual uncomfortable slippage of nerve in his retinas . He thought of the s'uniph attack and felt a stab of paranoia . Had this creature had anything to do with the attack ? As Endor 's bodyguard , Subrath would hear most of what Endor heard , know almost everything he knew . Subrath would have known Briana was sending another inspector . With an effort , Elias regained his perspective . He was here to get a feel for Endor 's loyalties , not Subrath 's . If Subrath had arranged for the s'uniph attack , he could only have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cassiodorus started at the top . " How is the Imperator ? " Endor asked . " She 's well . " Endor flushed and Elias knew with a flash of intuition that Endor had meant Gregory Amerdath , not his daughter . " And her father ? " Endor said . " As well as can be expected . " " A rotten , sickening business , " Endor said . " We were comrades . I was his navigator on the Scaramouche , back in the war . God , that man could lead . We 'd have followed him into hell . You 've seen him , Kane , you know his condition firsthand . D' you think there 's any chance he 'll rule again ? " Elias realized at once the importance of the question  --  and of his answer : Amerdath had ruled through bonds of loyalty forged in fire and sealed with blood . Each of his viceroys were old comrades . Even Richard DuMorgan had not turned against Amerdath while he was on the throne . If Gregory Amerdath were still in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold . If Gregory Amerdath were dead , DuMorgan might by now have been openly joined by many of the other viceroys . But Amerdath was neither in power nor dead . That left Endor in a sort of limbo . Should he transfer his loyalty to  | liriana to honor her still living father ? Or should he consider his loyalty to the lmperiurn ended ? On the answer , everything might depend . " Ile could rule again , " Elias said . " If he can be restored to a body . " Endor 's gaze was intense . " Subrath tells me that he wanted only to die . " " And how does Subrath know this ? " Elias said , sensing the danger , putting scorn into his voice . Endor lifted a hand in the Ornyl 's direction , freeing him to speak . The chubby speech hands twirled into motion across Subrath 's abdomen . " All Ornyl know of . . . the noble Chuddath . And of how you . . . thwarted his loyalty . " Elias felt his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of verbally . He controlled his anger , realizing Endor was watching him closely . Coldly he said , " Then all Ornyl should know this , too . The only thing the noble ' Chuddath proved is that Ornyl are n't fit to judge the human mind . " Elias looked pointedly at Cay Endor . " With respect , sir : I assume you 've bonded Subrath to you with the S'edhite link . That 's fine . You can depend on his absolute loyalty . But may I advise you never to mindmeld with him . As men , we all have thoughts and wishes we do n't really want carried out . " Endor looked at him with a mixture of fear and fascination . " May I speak further , " Subrath said . " No , " Endor said , and Elias knew he 'd won a small victory . He decided to press it . " Amerdath may rule again , and in the meantime , his daughter has his full trust . " " Is that so ? And tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elias said without hesitation , even as he knew that it was not true . Endor gazed at him a moment , as if assessing him . " Why did you want to see me ? " Elias told Endor about the earphone weapon , watching for any reaction . He described the autopsy findings for the dead attendant and his tangle with Jost  --  the terrible draining of strength he 'd experienced firsthand . As he talked , Endor sat up straighter , clenching the armrests of his throne , his face dark with anger . If he was faking , he was doing it well . Elias asked , " What do you know about this weapon , sir ? " " Only what you 've just told me . Damn ! It 's a shame you could n't have grabbed that one away from the men who attacked you . " " Yes , " Elias said uncomfortably . " But one of Jost 's men ran out with  | it when Pendrake caught them by surprise . " Ile hoped the lie sounded convincing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from handing the exotic weapon over and risking it disappearing into the hands of a rebel mole in Endor 's camp . And if Endor was n't clean , he 'd pass on the lie and it might spread some confusion among the rebels  --  take some of the steam out of any effort to reclaim the weapon . " By God , Lieutenant Krevvy better catch this Jost character . " " Maybe he could use some help , say an independent investigation by your own intelligence people . " Endor looked at him with narrowed eyes , as if trying to gauge whether he was overstepping his bounds . " Not a bad idea , Inspector Kane . I 'll do it  --  if for no other reason than to demonstrate how deeply I regret these attacks on you . " Endor gave a heavy sigh . " I know what 's really on your mind , Kane . You 're asking yourself : Who can I trust here ? Who can Briana trust ? I know you have doubts , and I know damned well those doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that there could be rebel elements stirring up trouble on my planet , the way they are on all the others . The fact is , I keep a careful lookout for any such sign . I do my best to run a tight ship . " But this is a rough planet . The kind of people it takes to survive and work here need to feel that they are , as much as possible , in charge of their own affairs . A good many of them do resent off-worlders in general , and officials from Earth in particular . That by no means makes them rebels in the political sense . But it does make some of the rougher types among them dangerous to men like you . Frankly , if Briana was as trustful as she claims to be , none of this would have happened to you . " " The three previous inspectors ? " " Yes , yes , " Endor said irritably . " I understand . Still , I can not help but feel questioned , despite her protestations of trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must represent the Imperium , be the Imperium to these people  --  but do it in such a way that they do not resent it or feel governed from outside . That is the best way to keep the Imperium together . Increased imperial presence  --  like your battleship orbiting up there  --  is the worst way . " I think I 've done a good job the last two decades , and so , obviously , did Briana 's father . The people of this planet are loyal to me , and I am loyal to the Imperator , so by extension , the people of this planet are loyal to the Imperium . We do n't need imperial inspectors tromping  | around hen ? with cal to blanche papers from 13riana , if you 'll excuse my bluntness . Trust us and well continue to get as much ore to you as we possibly can , just as we have always done in the past . " Elias was impressed despite himself . Endor seemed sincere and he had stated his case well . But " sincere " could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had put his finger on the problem : How did you tell a colonist loyal to the Imperium from a rebel thirsting to overthrow it ? The rebels were not fools . They wore the same clothes as loyalists , worked in the same mines , probably even drank in the same bars . They also met in secret , plotting , planning ; killing . It was not innocent colonists that had tried twice to murder him . There are rebels operating here , Elias thought . Whether you know it or not , Endor . " I appreciate your position , sir . I hope you 'll appreciate mine . From the moment Briana decided to send me here , there have been three attempts on my life . We 're not talking heart failure now , we 're talking murder . " Endor pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers . " What do you want from me ? " To know if you 're loyal , Elias thought . Just as you 've said . But that 's not going to be so easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " First , I 'm ready to see the mining books . I 'll need to review man-hours , cave-ins , daily averages , projected goals and actual production for each mine . " " That information is compiled continuously by my compusayer . I 'll give you access , but I 'd prefer you not let that be known . " " Understood . " " What else ? " Endor said . " I 'd like another tour of a mine  --  hopefully one that 's not about to cave in on me . And while I 'm at it , I might want to look around in general . Your permission ahead of time would make it a lot easier . Then I can stop waving that carte blanche you mentioned . Believe me , I do n't like it any more than you do . " " All right , " Endor said . " I 'll have Holz drive you around today . I 'll tell him to take you wherever you want to go . But I 'm warning you : Tread lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . In your zeal to root out rebel spies and secrets , remember that the vast majority of my people are hardworking , proud men and women whose worst sin is a nasty chip on their shoulders . " Do n't try to knock that chip off . Men have died from that , too . "  | The fierce gravity pressed Elias deep into the back seat of Ilolz 's groundcar . He was sweating profusely from the last little walking tour . Some company store or other that Holz was still babbling about . Elias . was acutely aware of Martha beside him and hoped he did not smell as bad as he felt . His nose was too clogged with dust to tell . But then again , hopefully , Martha 's was too . As Holz drove them back toward the guest quarters of the Rajinate , Elias tried to catalog what they had seen , sift it for meaning . Only one thing kept coming up : the children . Or rather , the lack of them . " Before Jost got around to trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me you do n't have many youngsters on the planet . " " That 's true , " Holz said . " But you do have some . " Holz glanced back from the front seat of the groundcar . " Of course . " " Where are they ? We 've been all over Neues Eisen , and I have n't seen one yet . " " In school . " Elias began to feel a mild sense of wrongness . All through the tour , Holz had been loquacious , showing them this company store , that bank , the other cafeteria , answering all their questions with more than they wanted to know . He 'd even indulged in a friendly , long-winded discussion with Pendrake on the feasibility of hiring Cephantines to help work the mines . Now , suddenly , he seemed to have a two-word limit on his answers . Elias remembered something else Jost had said . This world be no place for little ones . Jost 's voice had been full of sadness . Maybe kids were a sore point with Holz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd like to visit one of the schools . " Holz laughed . " Are n't you getting just a little tired ? " Elias felt the gravity again , flattening his muscles , bending his bones . He became aware of his weariness , the unnatural stillness his body had adopted . As long as you sat in these nice cushions , you were barely aware of it . But your body still felt it . You looked at Martha from the corner of your eye instead of turning your head , you kept your hands on the seat beside you instead of on your knees , you worked hard to find a comfortable position , and once you had it , you shifted only  | when your spinal cord began to feel like a hot steel rod turning inside your back . " I was planning to drive us back to the guest quarters now , " Holz went on . " A rest period , and then some drinks before dinner at the Sisyphus . It 's really a grand restaurant  --  and controlled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . To shuffle back out in the thick heat of Cassiodorus when they could all go home to a bath and a drink ? He was n't being fair to the others . " I would find a visit to one of your schools most interesting , " Pendrake said with apparent clairvoyance . " So would I. " Martha put a hand on Elias ' knee . He felt a surge of gratitude to them both and realized how much he wanted this . It had nothing whatsoever to do with his mission on this planet . I want to see a child , Elias thought with longing . In something besides my dreams . " I guess that makes it unanimous , " he said to Holz . " Perhaps I could arrange it for tomorrow . " Elias thought of the mining books Endor was having compiled for him . That is what he would be doing tomorrow . The prospect was deadening , sharpening his need . " What would be wrong with right now ? " Holz sighed . " I must clear it first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elias pointed out . One of Holz 's hands left the wheel , inched toward the phone as if the air had petrified around it . " It may be difficult to arrange on such short notice . " " I 'm sure you can persuade them , " Elias said , tired of Holz 's sudden foot dragging . Holz made the call , muttering so low that it was difficult to understand him . " All right , " he said as he hung up . " I 'll drive you over now . " " Thank you , " Elias said , feeling better at once . The drive seemed to go on and on , through the outskirts of Neues Eisen and then a quarter of the way back around the city . As Holz drove , he talked . " You must understand , Inspector Kane . These children may not look and act like you expect . The heavy gravity in which they are born and raised affects them much more seriously than it does adults . Their muscles are small . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elias saw sweat rolling down Holz 's face for the first time today . He began to feel a gnawing anxiety . Just what was Holz trying to tell him ? Why was the man so afraid ? Elias began to be afraid , too  --  that what he  | would see would tear at his heart instead of refresh it . I le felt Martha 's hand close over his . I-le tried to give her a reassuring smile , but could n't . Holz pulled up outside two low , stone buildings . Both were windowless . The farther one was surrounded by a high , chain link fence with barbed wire at the top . The flag of Cassiodorus hung straight down on its pole outside the entrance to the nearer building . The pole beside it , which should have carried the flag of the Imperium , poked emptily at the sky . Elias felt the more distant building drawing his gaze again . " What 's the story with the fence ? " He asked Holz . " Looks more like a prison than a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inspector Kane . Not in . That is the former school building . Twenty years ago there was an almost impossible freak accident with the power plant . Some radioactive dust was carried through the duct system . Several teachers and children were affected and later died . The building was sealed off . We do n't use nuclear anymore , of course , and sealing prevents any danger to the external environment . We keep the building as a monument . The fence is to keep any curiosity seekers out  --  there are no doubt still some radioactive atoms firing off in there . " Elias looked away from the grim walls , the gleaming fence , chilled and sickened . " How horrible , " Martha said . " Indeed . Now , if you 'll follow me . " Every muscle in Elias ' body protested when he climbed from the car , but he ignored the pain , pressing forward with a mixture of dread and anticipation . The minute they passed through the entrance , he felt the welcome lift of gravity suppression , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , Hol Brader , was there to meet them . Elias felt a mild shock at Brader 's youth  --  the man could n't be more than twentyone . Though he was big , his handshake was curiously lifeless . His eyes had a hard , burned-out look . Elias ' dread deepened . " Doctor , Inspector , Mr. Pendrake , we 're honored by your interest , " Brader said without conviction . " If you 'll follow me , I 'll take you to the gym . The children are at recess now . " Brader led the way down a dim , empty hallway . The floor was thick with dust , as though it was seldom used . A low bank of lockers gleamed with an unblemished coat of green paint . Elias felt Martha 's hand groping for his again and knew she felt it too : what a grim , lifeless place !  | But when Wader opened the gym door , bright light and the happy cries of several dozen children spilled out . Elias stepped into the gym and stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not playing any organized game , but running around the gym with wild , cheerful abandon , pushing each other , tumbling and clambering up , laughing . They 're so awkward , Elias thought with a pang . He remembered what Holz had said about their development being hampered . His relief began to fade . One of the children , a small , thin girl , spotted them at the door . She stared at them , blinking , as if uncertain what she was seeing . " Hi ! " Martha called out . The little girl smiled and ran toward them . The other children saw them now and ran over , too . One tripped and others fell over him in a tumbling chain reaction , making Elias wince . But they scrambled up and were soon surrounding Martha and Pendrake . Elias watched , miffed and a little envious , as Pendrake marched around the gym with two children on each massive shoulder . Martha brought him the little girl who 'd seen them first . " Elias , this is Jun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hi , Jun . " The little girl said nothing but smiled back shyly . Her fingers felt soft and small in his . Something about her smile touched him deeply and he felt tears springing to his eyes . He blinked them back , embarrassed . " What 's that game you kids were playing ? " She looked at him without understanding . " Tag ? " he prompted . Still she said nothing . He realized suddenly that she was older than she looked . Something in her face gave it away  --  perhaps the length of her nose or a few extra millimeters of development along her jawline . She was on the verge of adolescence . And yet , her overall size made her look about eight . He looked beyond her to the other children . None of them were big . Not one showed the bullish robustness so routine among adults on the planet . It was as though Cassiodorus had stolen the calcium , the very marrow from their developing bones . Elias felt a spasm of hate for the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought savagely . Bring all these people home . Forget the damned beta-steel and the dreadnoughts . At the very least , the children ought to be evacuated , taken to  | Earth , where they 'd have the same chance other kids had to grow up normally Elias felt a jolt of realization : That is exactly what I Iolz had been afraid of . Everyone on this planet must be afraid of it  --  that the wrong person would see , a person with the power to act against them . To take away their children . He watched Jun run back to her friends , his throat tight with emotion , his head swimming suddenly with questions : Why did the heavy gravity do this to the children ? And knowing that it did , how could anyone on this Godforsaken world ever let himself have a child ?  | ELIAS COULD NOT SLEEP . HE ROLLED ONTO HIS SIDE , staring at the wall . It glowed in the dim spray of light from the slitted bathroom door . Maybe he should shut the door completely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needed to see , in case someone slipped in . He felt under his pillow for the ruptor , then tossed restlessly back onto his other side , peering down past his feet to the room 's entry door , knowing he 'd locked it . He felt uneasy anyway . He checked his clock . Four-fifteen . The silence of his room oppressed him . He caught himself talking to himself  --  running an aimless inner chatter in his mind to block out the silence . He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling , remembering the two fairy tale days aboard the Seraphim . Martha in his cabin almost all the time . The wonderful warmth of her closeness , her touch . How deeply he 'd slept when she was with him , never waking or looking at the door . Needing no light through the endless night of space . In the empty silence now , he remembered how they 'd talked . He could hear her voice rising and falling in its own natural music , full of life and intelligence and enthusiasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her thoughts and feelings  --  what she wanted , hoped for and feared . Even her little cast-off remarks were full of interest  --  medicine , her lab , hiking . She liked to climb big rocks , inching up high and clinging ; deliberately looking down to spook herself . He wanted to hear more . He wanted to keep listening to her , filling himself with her . I 'd never get it all , he thought . There 'd always be more . He felt a sharp yearning for her . She 's just down the hall .  | After the Seraphim , why did I go right buck to being alone ? Because I 'm an idiot . He stared up at the ceiling , feeling his eyes widen with revelation . He 'd been describing love to himself . I love her ! He felt a burgeoning excitement , realizing that something had changed inside him . Changed at some indeterminant time in the past few weeks , and at last he 'd let it through and realized it . He sat up in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion broke through inside him like a dam bursting ? the love , and a giddy , thrilling fear . He grinned into the semidarkness . An idiot , yes . But not anymore . He got up and strode to the bathroom , his legs springy despite their aches and pains . Humming , he scrubbed his face , combed his hair , brushed his teeth  --  still humming around the toothbrush . He pulled on his robe , threw the bolt on his door with a flourish of his wrist . He hurried down the hall to her room , eagerness bounding inside him . He knocked gently for almost a minute , until at last she opened the door , blinking sleepily , the pattern of her bedspread imprinted on one cheek . " I 'm in love , " he announced . She closed the door in his face . Inched it open again . " With whom ? " " You . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . " She looked wide awake now . " Do n't beat around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me , just come right out and say it . " He grinned , trying to think of a reply , but before he could speak , she grabbed him around the neck and gave him a long , slow kiss , backing into her room , pulling him along . He felt the dissipating heat of sleep all along her body . She drew her head back at last . " No fair . You brushed your teeth . " He ran his tongue along her lips and she gave in , flicking him back then admitting him . Her mouth tasted musty and sweet . He felt her even through the centimeters of plastiflesh , then thought of the buried , alien thing he was pressing against her and tried to pull away . She would not let him . Her kiss was hot and eager , rousing a rush of passion in him . Dizzy with pleasure , he pulled her back to the bed , falling over with her , laughing . She divided his robe , her warm hands sliding on around his ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She raised her legs along his flanks , channeling him down until her ankles locked behind his waist , sealing him into her . He had the sudden overwhelming sense of her goodness , her perfectness for him . I love  | you , he thought with joy ; without amazement , as though he had always known it . She was smooth and firm , sliding around his hardness , moving to her own pleasure and increasing his until he had to shout , biting it back , exploding , soaring with her in molten , golden arcs . He lay with her , feeling an idiotic grin stretch his face . He went back to her with his hand , wanting desperately to please her . She took it greedily , making soft , joyous cries , grabbing him at last to make him stop , shuddering , crying out over and over . She gave a huge sigh and rolled tight to him , draping her arm and leg over him . " I love you , " he said . " I believe you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held her smooth flank , moving his hand just enough to keep the warm , satiny sensation alive in his fingers . His mind floated back and forth . Martha . Me . Martha and me . And children . His mind leapt back to the children he had seen yesterday . He saw little Jun 's face again in his mind . Her mute smile haunted him , repainted in his memory as a plea for help . Elias looked at Martha , gazing into her face , entranced with its slightly lopsided beauty . She gave him the crooked little smile he loved . " What are you thinking about ? " " How I worship you  --  the pads of your feet , the little curls in your ears , and the way your top and bottom teeth do n't quite match up . " She dug him in the ribs . " And what else ? " " Those kids we saw yesterday . " " I know . I ca n't get them out of my mind either . " " That other building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If there was really a nuclear accident there twenty years ago , why build the new school right next to it ? OK , the building was sealed off , it was probably safe , but still it nags at me . " " Holz said they kept it as a memorial , " she said , " but I wonder . If a bunch of their kids had been killed by a sauroid from the wastelands , would the colonists stuff the damn thing and display it as a memento ? " " Exactly . And yet they keep that building . Why not run a decon on it and raze it to the ground ? And another thing : If the gravity is so harmful to the kids ' development , why do n't they just keep them in Earth-normal G until they grow up ? " Her hand came to rest on his back . " Mmm . Good point . Adults from off-planet seem able to acclimate . How , I ca n't imagine , but they do . So  | why not keep their kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acclimate ' em ? Maybe it has something to do with expense . Suppression is too expensive for most regular homes . It would mean giving up their kids to separate dorms , visiting them there instead of having them at home . " " Would n't you do that , before you let a child of yours become like what we saw ? " " Yes I would , " she said soberly . " Elias , what are you getting at ? " " I 'm not sure . " He felt a sudden exasperation . The paradoxes on this planet kept piling up : People who could work all day in 1.5 G 's , and have enough strength left over to kick up their heels half the night . Then those same hyperstrong , hyperactive people having weak , dull children . Having them even though they must know what would happen to them . Elias made up his mind suddenly . " I 'm going back to that school . What time is it ? " He raised himself to an elbow , looking over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock . " " Are n't you supposed to look at the mining books today ? " " I can still do that . " " Holz wo n't want to take you back there . " " I 'm not going with Holz . Have you got something in that medical bag of yours that will detect radiation ? " She turned on the light beside her bed , making him squint . " Elias , not that building . You ca n't go there . " Her voice was frightened . " I do n't think they had a radiation accident there . I think that building is in use . " " Why ? How ? " " I do n't know , damn it . But too many things do n't add up right . Has it occurred to you that all those kids we saw yesterday were at least nine years old ? They looked younger , but I 'm betting they were n't . So where are the five- and six-year-olds ? I think they might be in that building . And for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But how are you going to get in there ? Even if you 're right , they 'll stick to their story . " " I 'll sneak in . " " It 's light by now . Someone 'll see you . " " I 've got to go in during the day . That 's when the kids would be there . I 'll wear clay-colored clothes and dart from bush to bush . " He gave her a weak grin .  | " There are n't any bushes . And there is n't any darting , either , not on this planet . " " So 1 ' 11 crawl . " She shook her head . " Elias , maybe there is something strange going on with the kids on this planet . But even if there is , what could it have to do with the mines ? With rebels siphoning off beta-steel ore ? " Elias felt frustrated , knowing she was right , irritated that he could not refute her . " Does it have to be connected ? If these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know it . I want to do something about it . " He realized with embarrassment that he was almost shouting . But Martha only smiled . " I love you , too , Elias . And I 'm coming with you . " Elias looked at her in alarm . " No , two of us slithering around would just make it twice as hard . " You ca n't come , because the place might really be radioactive , and I ca n't let anything happen to you . She took his hands . " Elias . . . OK , what you say makes sense . It 'd probably be harder for two of us to get in . But you 're thinking something else , too , and you and I both know why . You loved Beth and she was killed . You 've been so afraid to risk it again , and now you 're beating that fear . Do n't slide back . " Elias brought her hands to his lips and kissed them , unable to speak , afraid , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was so hard . " You 're not going to lose me , " she said . " No , " he said with fierce determination . " I 'm not . " Elias walked out through the empty lobby of the guest quarters onto the street , feeling the extra gravity drop like a huge pack onto his back . The air was already warm and soupy , the sun a miserable reddish glow over the tops of the squat buildings . The streets were empty except for a large airtruck , filled with big men heading for the penetrator road out of the city . Miners on the way to work , no doubt . Elias waited several minutes for a cab . Sweat built up at his hairline , rolling down his face , as his calves began to work up to the familiar ache . Finally a cab cruised up . He gave the woman at the wheel an address several blocks from the school . If she recognized him and reported in , they 'd no doubt guess where he 'd gone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drove , she kept giving him odd looks in her mirror , and his heart sank . I 'm too thin , he thought . Everyone who 's been on this damned planet any length of time is built like a landing pad .  | " From what planet be you ? " the woman asked . He felt a small relief : she knew he was an off-worlder , but she did n't know he was from Earth . " Cerulyx , " he said , trying to give it the proper accent . " Good , " she said . " Ye be miners , too . " " But not like thee . " That did the trick . She held forth on the " devlish perils " of life on Cassiodorus . She pointed out each dead groundcar they passed and complained bitterly about the clay fouling everything . She was still talking when she pulled to a stop . He realized with sudden alarm that he had to pay her in cash and he had nothing but a few imperial credits . Damn ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't give her those . Might as well beg her to report him . He broke into a sweat , patting his pockets . Her face hardened . " Do n't tell me thou hast no money . " " Will'st take this watch ? " He slipped it off his arm and held it out to her . Her eyes widened . " That be from Earth ! " " I did n't think the imp who wore it would miss it . " She laughed . " Rogue ! ' T is too valuable . " " Not if thou wilt come back for me too , say , in three hours , at this spot ? " " Done , stranger . But even then , I 'll have to make thee some change . " She peeled off twenty Cassi credits from her roll , looked at the watch again and gave him another ten , each bearing the image of Cay Endor in his plain uniform . She drove off and Elias sighed with relief . He looked around him , trying to orient himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by warehouses and maintenance depots . According to the map Martha had got on her shopping trip , the school should be two blocks down , to the west of the warehouses . He began to slog down the street , wondering at its emptiness at nine o'clock in the morning . Probably there were tunnels below the street connecting everything , like those Holz had taken them through yesterday . That way the colonists could walk between the buildings in relative coolness . Coolness . He stopped to blot at his face with his sleeve . After the air-conditioning of the cab , the heat seemed even worse . He wished grumpily that he 'd had the cabbie drive him closer . Setting out again , he felt his extra weight dragging him down , flattening the cartilage in  | his knees and ankles , pumping rivulets of sweat down his back . God , you could never get used to this  --  not in a year , not in ten years . Two blocks brought him to a couple of hydroponics warehouses separated by a narrow alley . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ought to be the school . He cut through the alley , pressing his hands against the walls , easing some of the weight off his aching feet . Looking out the end of the alley , he saw the two squat school buildings surrounded by several acres of flat , hard-looking clay . He could see no one around outside , just what he needed for his approach , and yet somehow the air of desertion touched him with foreboding . The high , chain link barrier gleamed redly into his eyes as the sun found a gap in the endless heavy clouds . He patted his pocket , feeling the reassuring , pencil-shaped outlines of Martha 's laser scalpel and radiometer . Elias set out for the fence , trying to just stroll calmly , thinking how he would use the laser scalpel and . . . He caught movement shimmering through the corner of the fence and dropped flat , jarring his ribs and knocking his wind out . He sucked a hard breath and looked up . The moving thing winked through the fence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of dread , Elias recognized the massive , insect legs , the forward-leaning body with its double sets of arms , the vicious , mantis head . An Ornyl ! An instinctive terror crawled along Elias ' spine . He pressed himself flat . Damn it , why had n't he seen the Ornyl yesterday ? Because Holz had called ahead . What in God 's name could an Ornyl warrior be doing here ? A watchman he could understand  --  someone to warn away the ignorant or careless , but an Ornyl was born for one thing : to kill . Almost half again the size of a man , a keen sense of smell  --  and those eyes : multifaceted , insect eyes , the best in the universe for detecting movement . Elias thought of the times he 'd seen an Ornyl in action , the fighting arms striking faster than his eye could follow , tearing a man into bloody meat within seconds . If this thing caught him , he would have no hope against it . And it would show no mercy to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , now ! But if they have an Ornyl here , they 're hiding something important . Elias suppressed a groan . With infinite slowness , he raised his head and watched the thing prowl along the fence , its long , reverse-jointed  | legs stalking , the awful head swiveling in constant motion . 1 las it already caught my scent ? Elias wondered . Fear stabbed through him . He had the overpowering urge to spring up and run back into the alley , keep running , find someplace to burrow and hide . He held himself still and watched . The Ornyl moved toward him along the fence , pausing at the near corner and continuing on around , beginning to recede . It had n't smelled him . Elias watched the Ornyl until it rounded the next corner of the fence , winking along through the mesh then disappearing beyond the building itself . God , I 've got to do it , go , GO ! Elias pushed to his feet and began to lumber forward . A fresh sweat sprang up on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fence crept closer at an agonizingly slow pace . How long before the Ornyl rounded the corner again and saw him ? You 're not going to make it . He sank to his knees and lowered himself flat , his heart booming with dread and exertion . He could feel the answering beat of the Ornyl 's feet through the clay , growing , coming toward him . He had only one hope now : that those cold , insect eyes , so good at detecting movement , were poor at recognizing a static pattern . Elias willed himself to absolute stillness . His cheek pressed against the ground , his gaze fixed on the Ornyl . It walked down the fence toward him . Stopped . Its head stilled and pointed at him . Suddenly the small speech hands tucked back into the protected position and the massive fighting arms extended toward him . A horrifying image flared in Elias ' mind  --  of his own body , a reddish pattern of dots , registering now in the Ornyl 's savage brain . He felt a thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the Ornyl stood , looking toward him . Go away , Elias thought desperately . The Ornyl 's vocal hands reemerged , sawed across the contoured speech plate of the abdomen . " Man ? " Elias tried to empty his mind , to be a piece of clay . The Ornyl moved off . Limp with relief , Elias watched the Ornyl until it disappeared again . He got up and scrambled forward , covering the ground to the fence with frantic , adrenaline speed . He settled on his side against the fence , saw that it continued down into the dirt . Damn ! He pulled the laser scalpel from his pocket . Quick , now  --  hurry ! He activated the laser  | and started cutting the mesh at ground level , snipping with horrid slowness through link after link . Beyond the mesh he could see a ladder going up the side of the building , steel rungs set into the block . Get under , get to that ladder , and he might make it . Ten links . He cursed steadily under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed under head first , wriggling forward on his belly . The cut ends of the fence raked his back , drawing fiery tracks of pain into his skin . There  --  through ! He pushed up and lumbered to the ladder set into the building . Climbing straight up made the gravity seem to redouble . His shoulder and leg muscles burned with the effort . He rolled onto the roof , pulling his legs out of sight just as he heard the measured tread of the Ornyl below him . When the steps had gone again , Elias crawled across the rooftop to the nearest air stack , a big , circular duct topped by a mushroom-shaped hood . It seemed to be sealed with black metal , but as he neared it , he saw that the " sealing " was really a porous , black screen . The interior of the school was open to the air ! To make sure , he checked it with Martha 's radiometer . There was no sign whatsoever of radiation . He felt a rush of excitement and vindication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The laser sliced easily through the screen . He wormed down inside the vent , clinging to a strut , his legs dangling below him . At once he felt the blessed relief of gravity suppression . Chilled air flowed past him , clean and wonderful , drying his sweat and restoring some of his strength . He hung a moment on the strut until his eyes acclimated to the semidark of the ventilation shaft . He saw that the large vertical stack he was in turned at right angles under his feet . He eased himself down to it , finding there was enough room to crawl on all fours . Ahead he saw a grid of light thrown up through a vent grille from a room below . He crawled to it and peeked down through . Below him was a classroom , small desks lined around the walls . There was no one in the room . There was another grille ahead . As he crawled to it , he heard the growing murmur of a voice . A mixture of anticipation and unease filled him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into another classroom . Children  --  seated in the desks around the walls ! These kids were much smaller than yesterday 's lot . They were looking down at what appeared to be alphabet primers  --  Elias could see the large , single letters and colorful illustrations . This must be the earliest grade .  | A terrible sense of wrongness gripped Elias . The children were so still . Each little head bowed unmoving over its book . They almost looked asleep . But he knew they were not asleep . 1 le could detect just enough movement to be sure of that  --  a hand twitching , a head rolling sluggishly to the side . No normal child was ever that still . Were they drugged ? A woman 's head and shoulders came into view just below him and he froze . She walked up and down slowly , looking from side to side at the children along the walls . She walked over to a little girl who was moving feebly , fretting the edge of her page with one finger . " And what letter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . The child did not reply . " K. Can you say K , Marly ? " Elias heard the child say it , a voice so soft and weary that it tore at his heart . " Excellent ! " cooed the woman . " You see , you can do it . Everyone listen to Marly . Say it again , dear ! " But Marly did n't say it again . The teacher moved on . Elias felt a wrenching distress . What 's wrong with them ? A disease ? Dear God , they 're all so tiny , so still . He thought of the unborn child growing in Briana 's womb . How it would burst into life , squalling , beating its little arms and legs almost from the first day , filled with the wonderful energy of new life , so necessary to learning and growing and developing . Tears came to his eyes . And then he realized that the door to the room below had opened . He started to pull his head back , but he was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grille , the horrible compound eyes stared up at him . A cold shock went through him . " Man .. . " commanded the Ornyl . " Come down . Now . "  | THE CHILDREN ! ELIAS THOUGHT , TERRIFIED FOR THEM . But they seemed unaffected . A few raised their heads and stared dully at the Ornyl . The others did not even look up . Elias saw the Ornyl reaching up for him . He sprang over the grille opening . Metal screeched ; the duct slanted suddenly , and Elias felt himself sliding backward toward the Ornyl 's clutching hands . He scrambled with desperate energy , realizing that the warrior was yanking the duct down through the ceiling . The teacher screamed at it to stop , but it did not stop . Elias caught a duct joint and pulled himself up the slope , barely feeling the sharp , metal band tear at his fingertips . He made it into flat duct again and scrambled over the next room . It 's going to get you , he thought , but he scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made himself stop and listen . All he could hear was the rushing sound of the air . The Ornyl could be below him this instant , and he would n't know it . He heard a crash right behind him ; the Ornyl smashing up into the duct ! Elias sprang forward . A second later he heard the Ornyl slithering along behind him , Christ , it was in the duct ! Its acid , oily odor washed over him , striking him with terror . Then he heard a loud crash behind him . The Ornyl was too heavy ? it had fallen through the ceiling ! He laughed with savage glee and scuttled on . He lost track of time , hurrying through the dark , small space . The children sprang back into his mind  --  their utter indifference to the Ornyl . Incredible ! A gruesome , huge insect man bursting into their  | midst could not be an everyday occurrence for them . It should have triggered panic , or at least excitement . Elias felt a sick apprehension for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of here . Next time the Ornyl might strike up directly into him . Elias heard a distant crash . The ductwork shuddered . He realized the Ornyl was looking for him along the straight trunk line . He 'd thrown it off . Elation filled him . He realized that the air was rushing with more force now ; he could hear the low thrum of machinery . He must be near the school 's power plant ahead  --  Damn ! His fingers jammed down through a grille and he fell forward , spreading his feet , catching the edges of the duct , swinging head down in the dark . Sweat burst from his face and he felt queasy . He extended his hands and let himself go , dropping down into the room . Shocks of pain shot up his wrists as he hit and rolled , sprawling onto his side . He smelled dust and oil , heard the tick of metal contracting . He got up and groped ahead , his eyes peeling wide , straining to see in the darkness . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch . He hesitated . What if the switch shut down the air conditioner or the lights ? The Ornyl would know instantly that he was here . But he had to see . If he did not get some light , he might stumble around in here until he wasted his advantage and let the Ornyl get back on his trail . He flipped the switch . The lights came on . He blinked and squinted , his eyes adjusting slowly , making out the rest of a switch panel . Fresh sweat popped out on his face . He 'd been lucky ! There were rows and rows of rheostats only inches from the one he 'd thrown . They controlled the gravity suppression for various sectors of the building . If he 'd bumped the wrong one he could have dropped a huge , extra weight over a classroom of children . Or brought the Ornyl running . Elias looked for the door . There  --  through a forest of ducts and pipes , at the top of a short , cement staircase . As he headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Elias felt an overwhelming despair . Trapped ! The Ornyl would show him no mercy . He ran back into the room , trying to find another door , but there was no other door . He heard the Ornyl 's steps crashing behind him . No chance , I 'm dead , but he turned anyway and braced himself , thrusting his hands out . " Come on ! " The Ornyl stopped and stared at him with its fixed , mantis face . No  | expression  --  and yet he could feel its mocking amusement . His fear turned to rage . The chubby vocal hands slipped forward from their protected place under the fighting arms and caressed the contoured abdomen . " Do you think you . . . can fight me , human ? You were dead . . . from the moment . . . I smelled ? " Now ! Elias thought , lunging forward , seizing the Ornyl 's whirling hand in midsentence and crushing down with all his might . The warrior arched back as though riven by a huge jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflex , catching Elias at the hip , flinging him across the room . Elias hit on his side , feeling a burst of pain in his ribs as he slid into a cabinet , upending it , showering himself with tools . Pain raged in his chest . He could n't breathe , had to breathe ! He sucked at the air , knowing the Ornyl would recover and come after him . Get up , God , hurry ! Elias pushed to his knees , saw the Ornyl circling drunkenly , supporting its injured speech hand with the other one , its head still arched back to the ceiling . He knew he had only seconds . If he could rush around it He tried , but the warrior swatted him back against the wall . Pain rolled over him in waves , making the room go dim and spin around him . His legs felt paralyzed . He fought to stay upright against the wall , filled with fear as he saw the Ornyl 's head come down . It stalked toward him and he could sense its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He realized his hand was on the master switchplate . Gravity suppression ! He turned to the plate , scanned desperately for the rheostat marked POWER ROOM . There ! From the corner of his eye he saw the Ornyl leap for the kill . He twisted the rheostat to zero . The warrior 's leap sent it crashing against the ceiling . Rebounding , it smashed into the floor , then drifted up more slowly toward the ceiling again . Despite the two tremendous blows , its fighting arms reached out for him in passing . He shrank back , hooking his foot under a low pipe to hold himself against the floor ; waiting until the Ornyl touched ceiling again . It positioned its arms to fling itself down on him . As it pushed off , he reversed the rheostat , spinning it as far as it would go . The gravity struck him down , sprawling him on his side . The Ornyl rammed into the floor half a meter from him and lay still on its side , its head drooping over .  | Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got it ! 1w thought . Fighting the gravity , he pushed himself along the floor , putting several meters between himself and the Ornyl. 1 le stared at its huge body , afraid it would rise again . One of the huge fighting arms was bent at a crazy angle behind the body . The other arm was twisted and broken in several places , oozing green liquid . The Ornyl was helpless . Elias sat up against the wall . " Yeah , bastard , " he muttered . " I think I can fight you . " The Ornyl moved , sending a prickle along his spine , but he saw that it was only the injured speech hand , waving feebly . No doubt it still pained the Ornyl , even through its graver wounds . Elias remembered how Briana had taken Chuddath 's hands after her father had been gunned down in Chuddath 's presence . It had seemed like a consoling gesture . Later he 'd learned she 'd been inflicting excruciating pain on the Ornyl . He 'd felt sickened at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be dead now . Elias realized it was n't over  --  he had to get out of here . The teacher would have called for help . Police , or a rebel cadre , or maybe even more Ornyl might be arriving any minute . He hesitated . The Ornyl was helpless and conscious . It knew things he needed to know . An opportunity like this would not come again . " Who sent you to guard this school ? " Elias asked . The Ornyl gazed at him with its unnerving mantis eyes . Elias thought of another question  --  important : " Do you know who I am ? " The Ornyl 's uninjured speech hand struggled up to its abdomen . " Your speech ... is different . An off-worlder ? Earth ? " Elias nodded , digesting the implications : The Ornyl did not know him , had not been stationed here specifically to stop him . That meant that what was going on in this building was a secret to at least some of the citizens of Cassiodorus , too . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew their condition . So what was left to hide ? He worried at the conundrum , but no answer came . He felt a throbbing in his ribs and his back , where the Ornyl had flung him against the wall . The pain maddened him . " Who put you on guard here ? " he snapped . Again the Ornyl did not answer . " Why does this place need a guard ? " " That is not . . . my concern . "  | Elias swore . Time was passing . Help would be coming . If lie was going to get the answers , he had to get them fast . I ie pulled Martha 's laser scalpel from his pocket and slid across to the Ornyl . He took the injured speech hand gently in his , seeing the Ornyl 's body shudder . " If you live , " he said , " you 'll get over this pain . But what if I lase out your eyes ? " Hearing the words come from his mouth , he was revolted . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten an . . . Ornyl . " " Tell me what I want to know , or spend the rest of your life in the dark . How would that feel ? Your days as a warrior would be over . And what good are you for anything else ? " " I do n't fear death , " the Ornyl said , inflecting derision with a flip of its hand . " I 'm not talking death , I 'm talking blindness . " Elias felt sick to his stomach . " You could not force . . . me to live . " " Who stationed you here ? You have no S'edhite scar on your head , so I know you 're not linked to anyone . You can answer me . " The Ornyl made another contemptuous sound . " You insult me . What have I done . . . to make you think . . . I have no honor ? " Elias activated the laser and brought it close to the Ornyl 's eye . He felt sweat rolling down his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand hands trembling in the Ornyl 's brain , triggering its contempt , and yet he could n't make it stop . His reluctance exasperated him . This creature would have killed him without an ounce of remorse , but he could n't even take one of its eyes in cold blood , not even if it would solve the mystery of Cassiodorus . And it would be futile anyway : You could see mankind in the Ornyl 's body , but not in its soul . Where a human might have screamed for mercy , this Ornyl simply accepted , never even thinking it might have a choice . With a curse , Elias withdrew the laser scalpel . A huge relief filled him . " You are not like . . . other men , " the Ornyl observed . " The men I serve are . . . Ornyl in their hearts . They would have blinded . . . me . Why do you not ? " Its voice was subdued now . " Do n't push your luck , " Elias growled . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts . If this warrior is talking about rebels , he thought , then there is no hope for the empire . Elias Kane might unravel the dark conspiracies of this wretched planet , even defeat them . But in  | the end , Earth would lose to the colonists . Her own children . What had happened to those children , the adults of Cassiodorus ? Had the cold of space , the brutality of their new worlds , somehow seeped into their souls and transformed them ? Elias struggled up , feeling weary to his bones . He had to get out of here . It was past time to leave . " You fought well , " the Ornyl said . " Even though your heart . . . is soft . " Elias walked out without answering . The hallway outside the power plant was deserted . Gratefully he savored the physical lift of 1 G. He started down the hall , then realized that he had no idea how to get out of the building . Were there even any doors ? He searched his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a distance , and the back more closely as he 'd crept in today . There was no door in back , and the fence around the building had no gate . If there was a front entrance , the fence  --  and distance ? had kept him from seeing it yesterday . A tunnel , he thought . The children must go into the unfenced building and then are taken here through an underground passage . Should I try to find that passage ? He could n't decide . Tired , too much pain . Think , damn it : The teacher called for help , if anyone did . She 'll assume I came in the usual way and hid in the duct . Only the Ornyl knows I cut through the fence . So any reinforcements will expect to head me off in the tunnels  --  or whatever 's the usual way in . I 'll have to go back out through the roof . Elias groaned . He broke into a weary trot , trying to estimate his way back to the room where the Ornyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finding deserted classrooms , their ceilings intact . The third room was the right one , deserted now , its ceiling half shredded by the Ornyl 's furious attempts to get at him . He stood on one of the little desks , hoisted himself into the torn and bent duct and crawled back to the roof vent . His arms ached in protest as he grabbed the struts in the vertical shaft and pulled himself up . Protecting his bruised ribs as much as possible , he eased out from under the mushroom-shaped hood , back into the oppressive heat and weight of Cassiodorus . Sirens ! Damn ! He flattened himself on the hot roof and peered across at the unfenced building . A groundcar pulled up and spilled four men in blue uniforms . Militia ! He felt a dim surprise . Somehow , he 'd not really  | expected that . A colony 's militia was always under the direct command of the viceroy . Cay Endor had seemed loyal to the empire . Maybe I should just give myself up , Elias thought . Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Endor will give me a stiff lecture , but he 'll have to turn me loose . The idea lured him with almost irresistible force . To sit down , rest and wait passively until they took him someplace cool . His muscles cried out for it . Instead , he waited until the blue figures had rushed into the school building , then pushed up and staggered to the ladder . Back on the ground , he hurried to the spot where he 'd cut the fence and forced his way under . As he stood , he heard a shout and turned , his heart sinking . It was a militia man , heading over from the main building . They 'd thought of the fence after all . Elias cursed and broke into a lumbering run across the hard , red clay . He was much closer to the buildings along the border of the school grounds than the militiaman was to him . He should be able to get back into that alley with plenty to spare . But if the man started shooting The thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exertion . Sweat soaked him , and his ankles stabbed him with each step . He could feel a small , round spot spreading on his back , an imaginary target , making his skin flinch and crawl . But the man did not shoot . Right ! he thought . You do n't mind if an alien warrior tears me to pieces , but you do n't want a militia blaster wound to explain , do you ? As he entered the alley , Elias glanced back at the man . Only ten meters back . Damn it  --  how could anyone run that fast in this gravity ? It was uncanny , inhuman ! Elias staggered into the shadow of the alley and tried to set himself , to find some last strength to fight . The militiaman plunged into the alley , too rash , not expecting him . Elias hit him in the face with all his strength , sending a rocket of pain back up his arm . The militiaman 's eyes crossed and he rocked on his feet . Drop , damn you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man crashed over backward . The fury of adrenaline drained from Elias . Exhausted , he limped down the alley to the street beyond . He realized he was panting , but could not stop . He had to sit down soon , or he 'd fall down . How long had  | he been gone ? Would the cab be waiting ? I le tried to check his watch , then realized he 'd given it to the cabbie . A bitter laugh formed and died in his throat . Be there , please ! She was there . Elias crawled into the cab without a word . She said something as she started off and he grunted . Her head blurred . Just rest his eyes a minute . Someone shaking him . He struggled awake , feeling that a long time had passed . But no , he was still in the cab . They were stopped , back at the place where she 'd picked him up . " Here we be , sir . And I thank thee for the fine watch . " Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks to the viceregal guest quarters . Could n't he just have her take him there ? With an effort of will , he pulled himself from the cab . A terrible weariness gripped him as he walked back . Just a little farther , he kept telling himself . Then you can rest . By the time he reached his hallway in the guest quarters , he was walking hunched over , supporting himself with a hand on the wall . He thought with longing of his bed , waiting for him . Then saw that his door was standing open . He felt dim alarm , wondering if he should turn back . A fierce resentment welled up in him . No , damn it . Enough was enough . They had to let him rest . He paused in the doorway , seeing Pendrake sitting on his bed , wrapping his white hair in a headband  --  no , a bandage . Elias stared at him , trying to comprehend . Pendrake saw him , got up , hurried to him . Pendrake 's clothes were torn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A terrible dread seized Elias . " Martha ? " he said . Pendrake took him by the elbows , gripping him firmly . His black eyes shone with grief . " They have taken her , Elias . "  | ELIAS FELT DREAD FLOWING INTO HIM FROM PENdrake 's clutching fingers . They have taken Martha . No ! he thought . His room snapped into focus : Ransacked  --  his mattress ripped to shreds . All of the drawers torn open , some of them strewn around the floor . His head spun with the violence of it . He felt choked and breathless . Poor Martha  --  please , God , do n't let them hurt her . They had wanted the earphone . When they had n't found it , they 'd taken Martha . God damn them ! A surge of fury burned away his fear , driving out his weariness . But he knew the exhaustion would return and drag him down as soon as his rage faltered . He pried Pendrake 's fingers from his elbows and walked to the sink , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of water . His heart began to hammer with furious , shocky speed . Bastards ! He turned back to Pendrake , and this time Pendrake 's wounds registered fully , panging him , fueling his fury . " You 're hurt . " " Not as much as I ought to be , " Pendrake 's voice was heavy with self-contempt . Elias looked for a place to sit Pendrake down . The chair by the bed was strewn with clothes . Elias threw them to the floor and pulled Pendrake to the chair . He checked the bandage on Pendrake 's head , prodding gently at the wound . A trickle of orange blood was still seeping into the bandage and a huge , lavender bruise was spreading to either side of it , but he could detect no fracture . He examined Pendrake 's arm and stomach , finding shallow knife wounds , the kind made by slashing .  | Pendrake 's clothes around the wounds were soaked with blood , but the bleeding from them had stopped . Elias felt his rage blazing too hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you . He took a deep breath and let it out slowly . He said , " Tell me exactly what happened . " " I was in my room . I heard Martha screaming . I ran to her room , but she was not there . She was here , with the two men who helped Jost try to kill you the other night . They were trying to make Martha tell them where you had hidden the earphone . I tried to frighten them again , but someone must have been hiding behind the door . As I rushed in , I felt the knife stab me . Then something hit me , here . " Pendrake pointed to his head wound . " I lost consciousness . " His head sank down to his chest , and Elias saw that tears were trickling down his cheeks . " I failed her , Elias . And you . " Elias felt a rush of compassion for Pendrake . Those bastards had wounded him inside , too . " That 's not true . " Pendrake raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All this strength , " he said bitterly , " and what is it good for ? In the world of men , nothing . Why was I cursed with it and then put among you ? " " To show us that strength does n't have to turn into brutality . " Pendrake threw his head back . An agonized sound rasped from deep in his throat . " I let them take her . " Elias gripped Pendrake 's arm , suddenly frightened for him . He had never seen him like this . " Listen to me , Pendrake : Do n't ever think that you should become like us . " With relief , Elias saw the orange face firming , reclaiming some of its calm strength . " We 've both got to pull ourselves together , my friend . We 're going after Martha . We 're going to find her and take her from them . And then we 're getting off this planet . " Pendrake shook his head . " I am with you , Elias , but is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know ? " " It 's not hopeless . Just before we left the Seraphim , I heard Captain Streetham mention his K-scope . It 's a new device the navy uses to track down AWOLs  --  an imitation bloodhound , only much better . The pigs that kidnapped Martha left a trail and probably do n't even know it . Elias felt a savage determination giving shape to his fury : Find you , hunt you down , yes , and when I catch you , God help you all . Elias found the subspace radio Streetham had sent down with him lying on the floor , scratched but undamaged . He raised the Seraphim  | and asked Streatham to send a lander down with a K-scope . Then he hurried to Martha 's room . Her things , the smell of her perfume , struck into his heart , making him want to weep . He found the nightgown she 'd been wearing when he 'd left her that morning . Picking it up , he touched it only with a thumb and forefinger , interfering as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a specimen bag from Martha 's medkit . He got Pendrake and hurried out to the street to catch a cab to the spaceport . The sun was high now ; the street baked and shimmered with its heat . Groundcars and cabs flowed by steadily , and he flagged one almost at once . As he settled into the cab 's thick cushions , Elias realized he 'd barely felt the walk through outside gravity . The stims were working now . They 'd keep him going for about three hours . By then he should know whether the rebels had taken Martha out of the city . If they had , it might mean a long haul in a groundcar , and he could rest while Pendrake drove . Otherwise , he 'd take more stims , take them until he found Martha , or until the chemicals burned him into a twitching shell . He peered at the squat city sliding by , hating its ugliness , impatient to get to the spaceport . Rage flared again in him . They 've gone too far . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach down inside him and made it hard to breathe . You 're not going to lose me , Elias . And he 'd believed her . Dear God , he 'd had to , if he was ever going to love again . But she 'd been wrong . He had lost her , and it might be for good . And he should have seen it coming . Elias felt a choking tightness in his throat . All right , kidnapped , and he had to stop feeling and think : try to understand why they 'd done it . Was it really to get back the earphone ? Elias prodded his chest , feeling the perfect skin , the false but lifelike mat of hair ; wanting to tear the plastiflesh away , release the foul thing beneath , find the rebel bastards , fling it at them . .. . But it could n't just be the earphone . If that 's all they 'd wanted , they 'd simply have waited for him with a gun to Martha 's head . Give us our toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that . They wanted to control his report to the Imperator . His heart sank as he thought about it . If it was true , they 'd keep Martha captive for weeks or months . He 'd soon get a message warning  | him to go home and give a benign report on the mines . He 'd also no doubt be instructed to claim that Martha had died in some accident , so that no one back on Earth could know they were holding her life over him . To make him do it , they 'd promise that , after a certain amount of time , if he did nothing to contradict his false report , he 'd see Martha again . Otherwise , they 'd kill her . The amount of time they kept her would be the amount they needed to convert their ore to beta-steel , their beta-steel to dreadnoughts . And after that , they 'd either give her back or kill her . We were doomed , he thought . From the moment we came to this planet . Somehow they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt the choking sensation again , realized he was slipping out of control . He had to get hold of himself . The cab pulled to a stop and Elias realized they were at the spaceport . He paid with the Cassi credits the other cabbie had given him and got out . The two giant landing pads made empty white circles in the red clay . The control tower windows hemorrhaged red light from the sun . Elias was relieved at the spaceport 's emptiness  --  probably a normal day for a planet no one visited unless they had to . He looked around , spotting only two colonial officers , one at the gate and the other visible through the glass of the control tower , reading a book . The man at the gate was old  --  at least sixty . A large potbelly stretched his uniform . He looked surprised , but opened up when Elias showed him the Imperial carte blanche . As Elias hurried through , he saw the man pick up his phone . Never mind . Too late for that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the shuttle pad . After a minute , he located the orange , flaring burn of the Seraphim 's descending shuttle . He watched it with fierce impatience . " Elias , " Pendrake said . " The colonist from the gate is following us . He appears to be quite agitated . And a groundcar is pulling up outside the gate . It looks like a police vehicle . " Damn ! Elias thought . He checked the needler release below his elbow , hoping he would n't have to use it , readying himself with grim determination . The spaceport officer lumbered up , breathless and sweating in the heavy gravity . " Sir , sir , what be that ship ? We 've given no clearance to any ship to land . " " Do n't worry about it , " Elias said shortly . " It 's an imperial ship . "  | " But all ships must be cleared to land . They must go through normal procedures .. . . " " A pox on your normal procedures , " Elias snarled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Neues Eisen police trotted up , leading three uniformed cops . Krevvy 's coarse features were alight with anticipation . " Mr. Kane , I have orders from Cay Endor to bring you in for questioning on a breaking and entering charge . The school ? " " I countermand those orders . " Krevvy smirked . " Do you now ? " A sonic boom rolled over the spaceport , followed by the swelling roar of the shuttle . Elias glanced over his shoulder and located the craft . It looked much bigger now , and he could see its frontal shields shimmering in a corona of fire . Hurry ! Krevvy said , " I do n't recognize your authority to countermand the viceroy . I answer only to him . " " And what will the viceroy do to you if you shoot me ? " Krevvy looked suddenly uncertain . " No one said anything about shooting you , Mr. Kane . " " That 's the only way you 'll get me away from here . " Krevvy gestured to his men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needler . It dropped into his palm . " The first man that takes a step is going to have porcupines for eyeballs . " Krevvy 's face hardened . " This is a very serious matter , Mr. Kane . " He raised his voice , shouting above the descending roar of the shuttle . Then , as if noticing it for the first time , he turned toward it with a shocked expression . It was settling on the pad now , retros blasting up a storm of grit and dust . Krevvy turned back to Elias with an almost comic look of betrayal . " I ought to gun you down right now . " " But you wo n't . How long ago did you immigrate from Earth ? You still speak like one of us . That might help you survive in prison . " " You are directly defying the orders of the duly constituted government of this planet , " Krevvy yelled . The shuttle engines idled down and the sideport cycled open . Elias said , " Duly constituted by the Imperator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant who 'd presented his troops when Elias had first boarded the Seraphim brought his marines down the ramp of the shut
