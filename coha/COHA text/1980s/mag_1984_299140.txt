Virtually all agree on one thing about terrorism : they are against it . The trouble is in defining it . Secretary of State George Shultz ran into that difficulty with the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week when he testified in favor of Administration-backed proposals to combat the scourge . The legislators voiced few objections to a bill that would give rewards of up to $500,000 to those who provide information about terrorist acts . But they balked at one that would empower the Secretary to designate any government as " terrorist " and make it a crime for an American to furnish training or support for its activities or to act " in concert " with it . <P> Congressmen peppered Shultz with problematic cases . <P> Would Saudi Arabia be considered guilty of terrorism because it helps fund the Palestine Liberation Organization ? ( If so , might the U.S. Government fall prey to the bill 's criminal penalty for having sold the Saudis F-15 jets and other weapons ? ) What definitions would distinguish between Afghan rebels and Nicaraguan contras on one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hardly illuminating : " I think the concept must be different between an insurgency that is open and a terrorist organization and action . " The Congressmen seemed confused . " We have to proceed with care , " Shultz concluded . " That is the message being given to us in these hearings . "
