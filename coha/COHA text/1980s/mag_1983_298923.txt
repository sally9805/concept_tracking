The government tries to close the door on Western influence <P> When Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping decreed an " open door " policy for foreign capital and technology a few years ago , he somberly warned his people that " the penetration of bourgeois ideas is inevitable . " Sure enough , leggy beauties now glide along sleek runways in Peking modeling the latest Pierre Cardin fashions . Not far away , well-heeled tourists tuck into French cuisine at Cardin 's elegant new Maxim 's de Pkin . Even in rustic glades , jeans-clad teen-agers blast out punk rock from ubiquitous cassette players . Free enterprise has also brought in its wake less innocent forms of freedom . Earlier this year , Story , a tabloid filled with titillating tales of concubines and libertines , was attracting 2 million readers around the country and , according to one Chinese press report , subscriptions from 700 of the 800 pupils at a Shanghai middle school . <P> The inroads of Western decadence have apparently persuaded the government that it is time to start closing the door . Story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of China 's newest and most novel political campaign . For the past month authorities have been waging a war to eliminate " spiritual pollution , " a deliberately vague term that embraces every manner of bourgeois import from erotica to existentialism . According to Communist Party Propaganda Chief Deng Liqun , spiritual pollution includes " obscene , barbarous or reactionary materials , vulgar taste in artistic performances , indulgence in individualism " and statements that " run counter to the country 's social system . " Ostensibly aimed at those with a taste for capitalist pleasures , the purge has begun to descend on any artist or intellectual who seems reluctant to promote the orthodox Communist vision . <P> Many of the first signs of a cultural crackdown were exquisitely subtle . Premier Zhao Ziyang quietly forsook his Western suits for Mao jackets . The Peking municipal government ordered its employees to shave off their mustaches . The capital 's leading hairdressing salon announced that it would no longer give men permanents . Many of the first casualties were similarly obscure : a Peking shopworker who procured two illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative photos of their choicest scenes ; an enterprising commune in Fujian province that used its pooled resources to acquire twelve video recorders and 16 pornographic tapes , then charged viewers $5 admission ( about four days ' wages for the average urban worker ) . <P> But Western influence has apparently gone far beyond skin flicks and designer fashions , and last week the drive turned serious . Hu Jiwei , director of People 's Daily , was forced to resign , and Wang Ruoshui , one of the paper 's three deputy editors in chief , was dismissed . Their apparent crime : printing a scholarly article eight months ago that dared to suggest that " alienation , " a term reserved by Karl Marx for decadent capitalism , might actually be applicable to Chinese socialism as well .
