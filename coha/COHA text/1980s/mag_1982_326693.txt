Fanfani is asked to step in <P> Political crisis is as familiar to Italians as pasta , as regular as a strike , but the latest parliamentary high-wire act in Rome had even seasoned observers worried . His fragile five-party coalition government riven by infighting over economic policy , Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini had to try twice earlier this month before his resignation was accepted by an irritated President Sandro Pertini . In the resulting political vacuum , Pertini last week acted quickly , foregoing the usual ritual of extensive political consultations . Within 48 hours , he had made up his mind . Summoned to the Quirinale Palace for a trumpet fanfare and the mandate to form Italy 's 43rd postwar government was the Christian Democratic president of the Senate , Amintore Fanfani , 74 . <P> A political veteran , the stocky and pugnacious Fanfani received the call at a time when Italy 's feuding parliamentary factions seemed hopelessly deadlocked . The collapse of the Spadolini government , which had a prime minister from the tiny Republican Party and was the first postwar administration not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the U.S. Back in Rome , two contentious Cabinet members began trading public insults , and with that , the Prime Minister 's authority dissolved . Spadolini called for the resignation of the battling ministers . They balked ; in the tradition of Italian coalition politics , Cabinet members serve as representatives of parties , not at the pleasure of the Prime Minister . In despair , Spadolini resigned . Lamented Milan 's Corriere della Sera in a front-page editorial : " What we now have is not an ordinary government crisis . . . but the greatest of all . " <P> If anyone seemed capable of resolving the crisis , it was Fanfani . Four times Prime Minister in the 1950s and early ' 60s , the Tuscany-born Fanfani was known both as il Padrino ( the Godfather ) and , because of his ability to bounce back from political adversity , the Tuscan Pony . Despite his antiCommunist , anti-abortion stands , he gained a reputation as a pragmatist , forming the country 's first left-of-center coalition with the Socialists in 1962 . His ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present-day Socialists under Bettino Craxi . <P> At first , Craxi had insisted on either a short-term government with elections in the spring or else immediate elections ; either , he hoped , would strengthen the Socialists ' hand . But , after discussing the issue with Fanfani , Craxi apparently agreed not to raise the question for the moment and called on the Prime Minister-designate " to do quickly all that was possible to be done quickly . " <P> This week Fanfani may begin the daunting task of assembling a new coalition from the same fractious parties that tore apart the last government . Success is hardly assured : interparty feuding could quickly end a fledgling government or precipitate fresh elections before Fanfani can form a Cabinet .
