But first the unions have to get their actors together <P> Any movie or TV writer could have fashioned a conclusion that was more cheerful , or at least clearer . In fact , the apparent end of the two-month-long actors ' strike last week left about as many unanswered questions as the average episode of Dallas . After a marathon session , negotiators for the unions and the producers reached an agreement , but no one was certain when production would resume , or indeed if the 60,000 performers involved would ratify the contract at all . There were a few forced handshakes , but , as Industry Spokesman Philip Myers wryly phrased it , " there was no dancing on the tables . " <P> The biggest issue-how much the actors would receive from pay TV and from sales of video cassettes and video discs-remained the chief irritant to union dissidents . The contract guarantees actors 4.5% of gross revenues after the sale of 100,000 cassettes or discs , and 4.5% after each pay-TV outlet has shown a film or program for ten days . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of the profit from the first sale of the cassettes and discs and from a first showing on pay TV . There was less contention over other parts of the package : a 32.5% increase over three years in the minimum pay for actors , which would rise from the present $225 a day to $298 , and various improvements in fringe benefits . Said Union Negotiator Sanford Wolff : " I think that the economic aspects of the deal are sufficient and that the membership will and should approve the contract . " <P> That amiable curmudgeon Ed Asner , also known as Lou Grant , looked over the agreement and politely disagreed . " I think it stinks , " he said . " The results were n't even an approximation of our demands . " Dismissing the terms for pay TV , he added : " I do n't think any actor will get an appreciable amount of money out of it . " Asner may have a point : many pay networks typically show a film no more than ten times a year , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues are as unhappy as he is , but may vote to ratify anyway . The strike , which began July 21 , is the longest the actors have ever undertaken and has already cost many of them a good part of their yearly income . <P> Since much of the voting is done by mail and the results may not be known for two or three weeks , the union leadership may allow the actors to go back to work immediately . If that happens , production of TV series could resume as early as this week , and viewers could get to see the new shows by the end of October or beginning of November . A musicians ' strike , which has yet to be settled , will hold up work only if the actors refuse to cross the picket line . Film production may have to wait , and movie producers , who have big budgets to worry about , may not let the cameras roll again until the contract is finally approved .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
