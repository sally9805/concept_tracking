Mr. Papp called a lunch break , and the kingly posture dropped away . Peter MacNicol became himself - a gentle but driven 33-year-old actor , from Dallas by way of Minnesota , who has rarely lacked for work on the stage since he arrived in New York seven years ago. // Mr. MacNicol is the first major American actor to play Richard , according to Mr. Papp , the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival and the director of " Richard II , " which is currently in previews and opens officially on Thursday . " John Gielgud put a stamp on this role in his time - he was a younger man - and Maurice Evans , " said Mr. Papp . " I saw Jeremy Irons play it in London just a few weeks ago . But these are English actors , all part of that Gielgud tradition , kind of a sorrowful , Christlike portrayal , which I think , with all due respect to these fine actors , robs the play . Richard is a rapscallion who gets stronger the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bring something fresh to the play. " // Part of the difficulty of " Richard II " stems from the complexity of its poetry , which calls for an actor with the theatrical equivalent of an opera singer ' s range of expression . Mr. Irons , for one , was faulted by some critics for not having the melodic cadence the lines deserve , although he was otherwise congratulated for his performance. // Mr. MacNicol , said Mr. Papp , " has an extraordinary emotional capacity I ' ve seen in few actors . I ' ve never seen him do something false . He may make the wrong choice in an acting thing , and he sometimes takes enormous risks , but it ' s always truthful . It always comes from his insides. " // Mr. Papp will direct Mr. MacNicol again this summer , in " Henry IV , Part I , " which begins performances Aug. 21 . The play replaces " Titus Andronicus , " which was to have been directed by Charles Ludlam , who died last month. // Mr. MacNicol has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the open , achingly expressive face is most recognizable as Stingo , the post-adolescent , Southern narrator of the film " Sophie ' s Choice . " When Mr. MacNicol speaks , his intonations change with the part he is discussing : the gawky , gallant lawyer Beth Henley ' s " Crimes of the Heart " ; the despised defense attorney in Emily Mann ' s " Execution of Justice " ; Jake Seward , the naive spy of Keith Reddin ' s " Rum and Coke " ; Sir Andrew Aguecheek , whom he played in last year ' s Shakespeare in the Park production of " Twelfth Night , " and Richard II , the reluctant young king whose throne is usurped by his childhood companion. // Mr. MacNicol , who said he had not seen the play performed on stage , seemed puzzled by the suggestion that Richard II is a difficult role . " It ' s written entirely in verse , " he mused , " but I don ' t think that keeps the audience at arm ' s length one little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onstage action , but - and I ' m not just trying to be glib here - it has tremendous action of ideas. " // The play ' s central conflict is a psychological battle between King Richard and his archrival , the Earl of Bolingbroke , played in this production by John Bedford Lloyd . Mr. Papp faults British productions of " Richard II " for playing it too seriously . His own images of Bolingbroke and Richard are of King Kong ( Mr. Lloyd is a big , bearlike actor ) and Fay Wray . " Bolingbroke , " he said , " is awed by Richard , intimidated by him . He just doesn ' t know what to do with him , holding him in his hand there , he doesn ' t know whether to kiss him or crush him. // " There ' s also a lot of comedy in this play that ' s not generally played as comedy , " said Mr. Papp . " The British don ' t play it that way . They play it very solemnly . Peter can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In ' Henry IV , ' he ' ll have to play both comedy and seriousness . He ' ll have to deal with Falstaff , so he has to be a fast-talking , sharp kind of man . Peter can do that . He ' s highly educated in the art of acting. " // Mr. MacNicol ' s formal education as an actor came at the University of Minnesota and at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis , where he was a member of the repertory company for two years. // Kevin Kline , who starred with Meryl Streep and Mr. MacNicol in " Sophie ' s Choice " ( and who last summer played Richard III at the Delacorte ) , describes Mr. MacNicol as having " compassion , warmth and great wit . His comedy is very human , and the fearlessness he uses in his comedy work helps to make him suited to Shakespeare. " // " By inclination , I ' m a comedian , " acknowledged Mr. MacNicol . Indeed , he provided much of the comic relief in " Sophie ' s Choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siren Leslie Lapidus , from which he emerged frustrated and incredulous , face smeared with the wounds of passion . " Now I ' ve become this brooding thing . Aguecheek , give me Aguecheek , " he said , alluding to the comic knight he played in last summer ' s production of " Twelfth Night. " // Richard , in contrast , " stands tallest when he has been laid lowest . He ' s not a good king ; he was born to be a martyr . Most of us feel most alive when life is bestowing the very best of what it has - success in business and success in love . It takes these sorts of crests to feel anything like euphoria , but Richard , strangely , flourishes in the troughs . One senses at times a boredom with the affairs of state . As he is demolished , he becomes empowered and ennobled by the tragedy of the circumstances . As a king , he ' s just another king . As a martyr , he ' s exceptional. // " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Richard because we ' ve all been deposed at various times in our lives . He ' s the most human of Shakespeare ' s characters that I ' ve encountered , because he ' s rash , he ' s witty , he vacillates between magnificent courage and the most craven cowardice . He cherished his fineries , then in this moment of bleakness he ' s willing to give away his last thread . That range makes him so completely , recognizably human. " // Although work onstage and critical acclaim have come steadily to Mr. MacNicol , acting has often been so painful for him that he has run away - from New York and from acting - questioning whether to continue with it at all . He attributes part of that pain to the competitiveness of show business , but , he said , the roles themselves can also have a destructive effect. // Actors , he explained , " can be wonderful in a play , but they ' ve got to go out and be wonderful again . Excellence can be obsessive . On any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ' re like me - which is to say type triple A - I ' m the least merciful of all critics . And that sets up a tension that doesn ' t go away . You go home to someone who simply wants you to be you " - Mr. MacNicol was married last year to Marsue Cumming , a film producer - " and you pretend that you ' re there , like those townspeople in ' Invasion of the Body Snatchers , ' but there ' s always something under the surface , namely last night ' s performance . It ' s a cruel and dominating state of mind. // " There ' s no fire suit you canwear , " he continued . " Acting does pose dangers to people . You really , like Persephone , go down to hell for that flower - it ' s dangerous . I don ' t know how to do it without undergoing some identification with that character , and it goes far beyond some physical approximation. " // He described how , when he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Choice , " his role spilled over into his life : Like the three characters in the movie , " we did become great , great friends . " On the day of the scene " where I find them laying dead across the mattress , " after Sophie and Nathan have killed themselves , Mr. MacNicol recalled that the extras , playing the police officers on the scene , " were sort of lolling about , smoking cigars , not into the spirit at all , nor trying to be , and I had a rage that completely caught me unawares . Stingo , under these circumstances , would have felt much the same thing : These uncaring homicide cops - just another day for them . But the sense of loss was nothing I had to mimic. " // He snapped out of recounting the memory . " All this sounds so phony when actors are talking about this sort of thing . When I read articles about actors who are saying about how the character took over I just want to slap them and say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . You are not that character , you are you. ' // " But , " he added thoughtfully , " if you ' re doing it right , you ' re in store for some bruises. " // Mr. MacNicol has made only one movie since the 1982 " Sophie ' s Choice " : " Heat , " with Burt Reynolds , which came and went with the early spring . He said he is not particularly interested in working on film , but that when movie parts come , the financial freedom they bring is welcome. // His favorite roles are those in which he plays a friend , an " enabler , " as he put it , chalking up his preference to what he called an American desire to be liked . But with his role in " Execution of Justice " and that of the cynical Jack Burden in a recent production of " All the King ' s Men " in Providence , R.I. - both unlikable sorts - and with Richard , he " just really took the plunge and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hell with the nod and the grin . ' I don ' t care . All I care about is being good. " //
