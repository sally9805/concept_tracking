Raising his glass to propose a toast , U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci observed that the Swiss city of Bern was an appropriate setting for the round of talks about to get under way because it was the " capital of the capital of peace . " The observation was tinged with some irony , since Carlucci and his partner in discussion , General Dmitri Yazov , the Soviet Defense Minister , are responsible for the world 's two most powerful military machines . Yet at the end of their three-day meeting last week , the first full working meeting ever between U.S. and Soviet defense chiefs , both men agreed that the experiment had proved worthwhile . It was never intended to be a negotiation session for achieving breakthroughs . Said Carlucci : " The purpose is to start a military- to-military dialogue . " <P> One reason for Carlucci 's participation in this dialogue was his interest in forming a judgment on a matter of fundamental concern to U.S. defense planners : whether the Soviet Union 's basic military doctrine is evolving from an offensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first noted by some U.S. military scholars about two years ago . <P> Since at least World War II , Soviet doctrine has placed extraordinary emphasis on offense , specifically on the use of massive tank and artillery formations as well as swift-moving mechanized infantry units . The theory was born partly out of the determination never again to have to fight a war on home soil . While a switch to a defensive strategy could simply signify a shift of resources , with more being devoted to protection against attack , it might also mean that Moscow is determined to reduce overall military expenditures , perhaps as part of Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's drive to speed up development of the civilian economy . <P> U.S. experts who believe that a doctrinal change is in the works contend that since 1986 , Soviet analysts have largely ceased calling for military " superiority " and instead use such terms as " parity " and " reasonable sufficiency . " Other American experts deny that change is in the air . ) Summarizing that view , Harriet Fast Scott , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Reasonable sufficiency means whatever you want it to mean . " <P> During the Bern meetings , Yazov noted repeatedly that Soviet military doctrine was undergoing revisions but that it would take some time before the changes were reflected in defense exercises . Yet he signaled that the evolution was incomplete and would depend not on unilateral Soviet initiatives but on mutually negotiated reductions of forces by both superpowers . While not prepared to dismiss Moscow 's claims of a doctrinal shift , Carlucci concluded that the practical challenges facing the West from the Soviets remain undiminished . " There has been no change in their force structure or their strategic modernization program , " he said . " We need to keep our eyes open and look for those indicators , but in the meantime it behooves us to continue with our current NATO policies . "
