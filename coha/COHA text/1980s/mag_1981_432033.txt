 | Are you afraid to say no when someone in the crowd says , " Aw , come on , have a little drink ? " Do n't be afraid . If someone offers you a ginger ale and you do n't like ginger ale , you do n't hesitate a second to say " No thanks . " It 's just as easy to turn down beer , wine , or liquor ? and far , far wiser . Those in your crowd who really count will respect your refusal . Alcohol dissolves almost anything ? including your judgment . Under its influence , you may do things you should n't ? and would n't ? normally do . Most people think of an alcoholic as a smelly old bum sleeping it off in a doorway . But would you believe there are alcoholics as young as 10 years old ? Or that automobile accidents caused by drunken drivers are the number one cause of death among teenagers ? Or that teenage alcoholism is so bad a problem that many states are raising their drinking age limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , not a character flaw to be ashamed of . Just why one drinker becomes an alcoholic and another does n't is still a puzzle . But one thing is certain : Alcoholism is self-induced and self-destructive . This is not to say that a can of beer or an occasional cocktail will start you on your way to skid row . For the vast majority , they wo n't . But for a few , alcohol can be a bomb ? a time bomb . How can you tell if you may be an alcoholic ? If ... ? you have three drinks when others have one ... . ? you need a drink to make you feel more relaxed , comfortable . and at ease with people ... . ? you drink because it gives you self-confidence and courage ... . ? you turn to alcohol in times of stress or trouble ? in order to " forget " ... . ? you drink alone ... . ... you could be an alcoholic . and should n't drink at all . Even if you drink only beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you drink , but how much you drink . If you think you 've got a drinking problem , help is as near as your telephone . In every city . even in small towns , there 's an organization called Alcoholics Anonymous ( better known as AA ) , whose members ? all reformed alcoholics ? are ready to help you , night or day . And it 's free . It 's also " anonymous . " No one will say he saw you there . All right , let 's assume you are not an alcoholic . You 're a normal , healthy teenager who has just discovered that a beer or two ( or maybe a shot of vodka from the old man 's liquor cabinet )  | gives you a " lift , " makes you feel good , adds to your self-confidence , removes your inhibitions , and helps to make you more sociable . Maybe so ? for a while . But the effects of the " high " are bound to wear off , and when they do , you 'll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stimulant . Actually , alcohol is a depressant . Add to that the knowledge that the removed inhibitions may cause you to say and do things you would never have done otherwise . If you 're really unlucky , you can pass out , and when you come to , you 'll have to ask , " What did 1 do ? " Now , who would want to be in a mess like that ? I realize that a few lines from me will not keep you from having a drink or two if that 's what you want to do . I can only implore you to know your limits ? and never exceed them . And do n't drive while you are under the influence . Would You Like a Cigarette ? You certainly know by now what doctors say about smoking ? it contributes to lung cancer , heart disease , and emphysema ( impairment of breathing ) . In other words , smoking is bad for your health . Smoking also makes your breath smell , your clothes ( and you ) stink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly indoors . More and more , smokers are becoming social outcasts . Smoking is , to put it bluntly , a stupid habit . It does nothing for you , a lot of things to you , and drives others from you . And it 's expensive . If you want to smoke because you think it looks " grown-up " ? do n't . ( If you 're sneaking cigarettes , how " grown-up " are you ? ) Boys , if you begin smoking to prove you 're a man , 30 years later you will try to quit for the same reason . Girls , if my mail means anything , a startling number of boys ( and men ) have told me they prefer girls ( and women ) who do n't smoke . So your grandfather smoked like a chimney , and he lived to the ripe old age of 88 ? Well , good for Gramps . He was one of the lucky ones . Maybe you 'll inherit Grandpa 's luck . But maybe you wo n't . It 's a fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offends others . So what 's the sense ? Millions of smokers already have kicked the habit . If you smoke , quit . If you do n't , do n't start . Never mind that " everybody else " smokes . They do n't . And even if they did , why be as stupid as " everybody else " ? Are YOU Ready for Sex ? It may be hard to believe , but babies have been born to unwed mothers as young as 11 years old , so it should n't be a surprise to learn that some youngster , become sexually active at age 10 . The most difficult word to say in the English language is also one of the shortest . It 's " no . " Yet the inability to say that simple word can complicate your life in ways you ca n't even imagine . Particularly when it comes to sex . Sex among teenagers who are n't @#  | ready for it has had serious consequences in our society . ? Venereal disease is prevalent . ? Pregnancy is causing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A third of all abortions are performed on teenagers . ? Babies born to teenage mothers are more likely to be brain damaged or mentally retarded . ? There are more attempted suicides among pregnant teenage girls than among other groups . ? About 70 percent of all teen marriages end in divorce . What 's wrong with having sex ? Nothing . It 's normal . It 's natural . Everyone in this world ( except test-tube babies and those born through artificial insemination ) got here the same way ? as the result of a single sex act . So if you 're a healthy , normal person ( and I hope you are ) , you will have an instinctive craving for sex . Sex is a part of life , an important part . But it is only a part ? a part too much emphasized today in the movies , on TV , and in what we read . It is also a trap for those who do n't know what they 're getting into . The sex act is the most intimate relationship possible between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sex has emotional strings tied to it too . Almost always , one or the other ? boy or girl ? becomes possessive , jealous , angry , sometimes even violent . What you might have thought of as a single experience in " growing up " then becomes a problem that will place an adult burden on you before you 're adult enough to handle it . But I 'm not going to lecture you about sex . I 'll just point out a few things that will help you decide whether you are ready for it . Surveys show that half the teenagers in this country have already had sex . which means that half the teenagers in the country have n't , right ? So , half of you are saying " no " and avoiding a world of trouble and emotional upheaval at a time when you have to get your heat together to cope with such problems as growing up . continuing your education . and preparing for the rest of your life . If you do have sex on an impulse ? because you ge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to ) control yourself , it 's apt to be a disappointing and upsetting experience . You will fee guilty , ashamed , and ( oftentimes ) worried about it afterward . And that can harm your future sex life . If your partner is " using " you , or if you are " using " your partner , and you do n't really care deeply about each other , you 're not ready for sex . Of course , there are some teenagers who really do care deeply about their partners and are sure their are " in love . " But those who are sufficiently mature to handle a love-sex relationship will protect themselves ( and their partners ) from unwanted pregnancies as well as VD . When teenagers write and ask me if they should " go all the way , " 1 always say " Do n't . " The reason is obvious : Anyone who asks is not sufficiently mature to handle sex . The mature person realizes all the responsibilities that come with a lovesex relationship . Making love sometimes makes babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy occurs . Nature played a dirty trick on us . A male reaches his sexual peak in his  | teens . But a female reaches her peak in her twenties or thirties ! Boys in their teens are too young to marry and have families , but they have the strongest sex drive at this period in their lives . Unfair , is n't it ? But it 's true . And the sex drive is a strong natural instinct ? no matter what I say ? a lot of kids are going to have sex before they are in a position to get married . So I urge them to take precautions against unwanted babies as well as venereal disease . I am NOT condoning sex without marriage , I am merely being realistic on the subject . " Birth control " ( if you 're having sex for reasons other than having a baby ) is as much the girl 's responsibility as it is the boy 's . My mail tells me that an alarming number of teenagers find themselves in trouble ( VD or pregnancy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happened , " they say . Then they explain that if they go out on a date prepared to go all the way , " it 's wrong ? because then it 's lust , just plain raw sex for sex 's sake . But if you are n't prepared and the feeling just overwhelms you and you succumb to it , then it 's " love . " Rubbish ! When the desire to have sex overwhelms you and you succumb to it , his sperm and her egg do n't know ( or care ) whether it was " lust " or " love " ; the result is the same . You 're in trouble . When Parents Split The real victims of divorce or separation are too often the innocent bystanders ? the children . Teenagers can withstand the emotional shock of a divorce or separation a little better than younger children . But even so , it is a shattering experience to be torn between parents . If your parents are splitting up , you probably saw it coming . An impending divorce is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crunching is heard long before the final breakup . So perhaps you were n't taken entirely by surprise . But it will take all the maturity you can muster to handle the situation . Here are a few suggestions that may help you weather the storm : ? Do n't make your burden harder to bear by feeling in any way guilty about the split . Children are seldom , if ever , the cause or even a factor in a divorce or separation . ? Do n't make a snap judgment and take sides . The circumstances that led your parents to separate are far more complex than they may appear on the surface . Rarely is one party entirely to blame . Your parents have probably already been deeply hurt by each other . Do n't cause them more pain by blaming one or the other . A divorce is not the end of the world , although it may seem like it at the time . It is better to live between parents than to live with them in a house seething with bickering and quarreling or constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in choosing the parent with whom you 'll live . This can be an agonizing choice , but try to make it a reasoned one , not an emotional one . If , we 'll say , your father decides to move to another city , you 'd be wise to remain with your mother rather than uproot yourself from school , friends , and familiar surroundings . But this is just one example . I cite it to show you some of the factors you must consider in making a decision that only you can make . One more thing : Do n't feel sorry for yourself . And do n't feel guilty or ashamed . Divorce happens in the best of families .  | A Letter to Parents Dear Parents : I know this is supposed to be advice for teenagers , but there 's something that needs to be said . I 'm convinced that if every teenager 's house was really a home , the initials " J.D. " would come to stand for " just dandy " and not for " juvenile delinquent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociologists and psychologists have interviewed lots of them on what 's bugging them . Here is what these youngsters said : ? LOVE . We want parents who a love us , no matter what happens what we do . We want our dads arm .. more often . We want them home in ti for dinner so we can discuss the da . happenings with them . ? UNDERSTANDING . Maybe do n't even understand ourselves . we want parents who do , who will let explain and then listen to us . ? TRUST . We want to be put on own . We want our parents to expect best of us . . . not fear the worst . ? JOINT PLANNING . We want ents who will stand beside us , not o. us . We appreciate guidance in im tant matters , but after we 've pros ourselves to have fairly mature ju ment , we do n't want to be nagged a every little thing . ? PRIVACY . We need a place of own to retreat to and pursue our he bies . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters read or our phone co versations listened to . ? RESPONSIBILITY . We want o share of family tasks . But we 'd like know who 's to do what , and why . ? FRIENDSHIPS . We want the rigv to choose our own friends . And unless they have reputations for being " bac company , such as boozers or dopers we want them to be welcomed as gues. in our home . So ends the Teenage Bill of Right , How much of it applies to your home i for you to decide . But do n't ever say that you don ' ? understand what your children want Right or wrong , I think they 've made i. pretty clear . Do n't you ? Also a Parent
