' ' Birds Nesting ' ' is a large-format , slim volume bound ( by Mary Parry ) in a decorative ' ' English Bird fabric ca. 1800 , ' ' as the colophon states . Its text is a previously lost poem by 19th-century Northamptonshire poet John Clare , edited by Clare scholar Eric Robinson of Boston , Mass. // The London dealer in question knew and liked the Tern Press ' s highly individual kind of books . But this dealer also happened to be an expert on birds and books about birds . Before he saw ' ' Birds Nesting ' ' he was confident he could sell the entire edition - some 84 copies . But when he looked through it , Nicholas says , ' ' his jaw dropped . ' ' Mary offers that he was probably expecting zoologically accurate depictions of birds . But , says Nicholas , ' ' my favorite bird artist is Braque ! ' ' // // That French 20th-century artist was not at all concerned with ornithology . Nor is Nicholas Parry in his many colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Birds Nesting ' ' : He is clearly after the feel - more than strict observation - of the birds he has suggested in the subtle variations of silver-greens , misty grays , tree-branch browns , downy yellows , and sudden flashes of red or orange in his cuts. // With justice the prints have been described by Joshua Heller , who deals in rare books ( including the Parrys ' ) in Washington , D.C. , as ' ' hauntingly beautiful . ' ' Although Mr. Heller can be critical of some Tern Press books , he calls this one ' ' a watershed , ' ' a ' ' coming of age ' ' as the 50th title produced by the Parrys ' press since its founding in 1973. // It was the woman in charge of the antiquarian books department of the London shop who managed to save the day . She looked at ' ' Birds Nesting ' ' and said : ' ' Oh , it ' s all right - it ' s art , it isn ' t birds ! ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their two-person press are all about . They feel that this , above all , is what makes their efforts different from the 200-odd other private presses in Britain . The Parrys aim to ' ' bring the book up to the realm of art , I suppose , ' ' says Nicholas . Art , he feels , has to do with a more finely tuned balance of eye , soul , nature , and hands than ' ' craft , ' ' which usually emphasizes ' ' materials and techniques. ' ' // Visiting and talking with the Parrys in their home-cum-workplace here , one is soon aware that what this unpretentious but determined couple is managing to pull off is something much more than a ' ' cottage industry. ' ' // Their house goes back 300 years at least , is decorated ( not without significance ) with Morris-design wallpapers and , in the kitchen , curtains and a tablecloth in an oddly familiar ' ' English Bird fabric ca. 1800 ' ' ( left over after the book ) . // The Parrys combine extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment that , at best , communicates itself with fresh directness . People buy their books , the Parrys reckon , because they find them ' ' friendly ' ' - or so some have said . But Nicholas also maintains he would ' ' like to think people buy our books for the risk . ' ' Risk is finally what he feels differentiates between craft and art. // Many private presses settle for a formula , for a type face or a paper they can master and then use over and over again . Such automatic perfection is not the Parrys ' way : One critic , Roderick Cave , has faulted their earlier books for ' ' roughness ' ' and for being too ' ' hand crafted. ' ' // The Parrys do not believe this is a necessarily a negative thing , though . They say they have never once repeated themselves : Every book is different , worked out from scratch . This can lead to a certain amount of ' ' mess . ' ' Their subjects range from the gospels ( in unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five-book project ) , to early English verse ; from modern poets to translated Anglo-Saxon writings to short essays by 19th-century nature-writer Richard Jefferies. // With each new book - and both husband and wife choose the text - they try to find the form and texture and techniques best suited to it . ' ' In the past , ' ' Mr. Parry muses , ' ' two or three people have accused us of having ambitions beyond our abilities . Which is fair enough - but . . . . ' ' That qualifying ' ' but ' ' has to do with ' ' art ' ' versus ' ' craft , ' ' in his mind . ' ' Every time , you should take a chance , shouldn ' t you ? ' ' Parry asks rhetorically. // He displays a host of drawings and ideas in a sketchbook - things he has tossed around in his mind : echoes of Michelangelo , some of them , figures in action - background and preparatory thinking for his current project , the 5th-century ' ' Taliesin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for the Frankfurt Book Fair in October . ' ' At this moment , it ' s all risk . ' ' That word again. // BOTH the Parrys were artists before they took up the cause of the book . Mary is a trained lithographer , and her previous work in dress design has provided her with some fresh ideas , and materials , for clothing books - tailor ' s canvas , for instance , for binding. // The originality of the Tern Press books certainly comes in part from the Parrys ' not having had previous experience of making books : They have broken rules . Joshua Heller believes they ' ' purposely live on the fringes of the private press movement - and there ' s a lot of it going on now - in England , ' ' and he praises Nicholas Parry ' s determined streak of originality : ' ' He follows his muse. ' ' // Mr. Parry enjoys the whole idea of a book ' s privacy . On a more commercial note , he also points out that a buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pages of a Tern Press book for a price that is actually less than the cost of any one of those prints framed separately on a gallery wall . Books also very effectively preserve the fresh colors of their art work. // There is a market for such books , even if it is a slow one . The Parrys don ' t often now deliver their books by tandem bicycle as they used to . When they started , they thought they would have to do without a car . Still , running their press full-time is a cliff-hanging business , financially . In Britain , unlike the United States , there is nothing much available in terms of grants or prize money to support private presses. // Heller has sold some of their books to a number of leading libraries in the United States . But he says , ' ' I can ' t sell their books from the catalog . I ' ve always got to show the books , introduce them , and then people buy them and become absolute fans . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of texture , of unreproducible color , of form and feel that need to be experienced first-hand . Heller is convinced that ' ' down the line , in 50 years ' time , they will be recognized , in the revival of the artist ' s book in England as being something that is uniquely the Parrys ' .
