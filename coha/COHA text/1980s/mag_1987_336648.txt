For the first time in many months , Corazon Aquino wore her fighting color : yellow . It had been adopted as a trademark hue by the gigantic crowds that participated in her greatest triumph , the 1986 overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos . Now the Philippine President was taking up the color again as she launched a campaign against her gravest threat , a deep national malaise brought on by government ineptitude and the continuing threat of violent rebellion from left and right . <P> Speaking to a gathering of 1,300 supportive but nervous businessmen in Manila , Aquino was feisty , sarcastic and uncommonly firm . Said the President : " The question you all really want to ask is Can she hack it ? Is n't she weak ? " She proceeded to argue that she was strong . " Henceforth , I shall rule directly as President , " said Aquino . " To the ad hoc committees and commissions created to inform me on their special areas , I add one more : an action committee of one member  --  me . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle Communist insurgents , the President said her methods have " always been clear . First talk , and then fight . " When the talks failed last February , she said , " it was time to fight , and it is still fighting time . Am I also expected to take up an M-16 and do it myself ? " To respond to criticism that she was soft on the militant labor movement that had shut down numerous factories , she issued orders for the police to take down illegal strike barricades immediately . She castigated the military mutineers who sparked the current crisis with their nearly successful August uprising . " They fought me , I fought back . Surrender would have been neater , but it is not in me to yield .

Other papers rushed to publish Aquino 's full text . Despite her rightward swing against labor and the Communists , even some of the President 's supporters in the moderate left applauded the speech 's implications . Indeed , many had felt that her aura of saintliness had got in the way of her politics for too long . <P> Aquino immediately set about personally surveying her domain . Amid threats of imminent coups and assassinations , she visited Davao City on the strife- torn island of Mindanao . By week 's end the police were tearing down strike barricades . The moves are proving to be popular , so much so that even Aquino 's disaffected Vice President , Salvador Laurel , has begun to soften his criticism of her leadership . Earlier , Laurel admitted there was a tactical alliance between some of his supporters and those of Aquino 's archrival , Senator Juan Ponce Enrile . After the President 's speech , Laurel said his differences with her had " started to narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " beautiful platitudes on garbage disposals . "
