txt  | Then sang she incantations over Svipdag to protect him from danger and to heal his wounds , to give him courage and set him free from prisons . She also sang incantations to protect him against raging rivers he must needs cross , and against ocean 's perils and the perils of vast and high mountains over which he must climb . Nine incantations did Groa utter , and the last gave him security to traverse Nifel-hel and enter Mimer 's grove . Whereupon Groa 's voice was silent , and her spirit returned to the Underworld . Satisfied he would be indeed safe from all danger , Svipdag went northward towards the battleground of the giants . It was his desire to first avenge his grandsire 's death and his mother 's shame ere yet he would search to find Freyja . So he set himself to lead a giant host against the army of Halfdan , and a dread conflict was fought . Svipdag was in the midst of the battle , and with Halfdan he waged a duel , but he was overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the north . Deep was Halfdan 's admiration for the prowess of the young hero , and he offered him his friendship if he would become his ally and help him to continue the campaign against the giants with whom Ivalde 's sons were in league . But Svipdag scorned his friendship with defiance , and Halfdan in his wrath caused him to be bound to a tree in the midst of a thick forest , so that he might become the prey of wild beasts . Groa 's son , when he was alone , bethought him of the incantations which his mother had uttered , and one he repeated till the chains that bound him flew away and he was set free . Hither and thither he wandered discon-  | solately , nor giant nor foeman could he see , nor could he discover which way he should go . Then came he to the moon-god ere he rose on his path through the heavens , and by him was Svipdag told where he would find the Sword of Victory which ThjasseVolund had forged . In Mimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed , and thou must needs overcome the Keeper of Hela 's gate to obtain it . " Towards the trackless regions that lead by Hvergelmer 's mountain did Svipdag then journey , and over the caves in which giants guard their accursed hoards of treasure . Intense and bitter cold prevailed as he traversed over frostbound ways and wreaths of blocking snow . Now he had need to climb great precipices , and ofttimes he found himself on dizzy mountain ridges , while dread chasms yawned below him . Through many places of horror and peril did Svipdag traverse until he reached the borders of Hela . There he beheld a fair land that gleamed before him , full of flowers of rich fragrance . He crossed a dark valley , and a hel-hound pursued him , barking loudly . Then came he to the River of Blades , which was spanned by a bridge of gold , and beyond there was a stone door in Hela 's wall , guarded by a strong watchman .

Mimingus lay asleep , and Svipdag overcame him and  | bound him where he lay . He took from the wall the glittering Sword of Victory and the great Arm-ring which Thjasse-Volund had forged , and then hastened to return by the way he had come . So traversing again the mountains of snow and misty blackness , and escaping the dread perils about him , Svipdag returned with his treasures from the Underworld . Then without delay did the vengeance-seeking son of Groa open a new campaign against Halfdan . In Asgard it was known that he had secured the dreaded sword which Thjasse-Volund had made so that he might overcome the gods . Mighty Thor seized his iron hammer and went forth to help his son . Great was the battle which was waged . Svipdag mowed down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrow shot from the bow of Orvandel-Egil . Then did Thor press into the midst of the fray , fighting fiercely against the giants , who fell before him until he came against Svipdag . But the hammer which Sindre had made was of no avail against the young hero , for with the Sword of Victory it was struck by The Shining One and severed from the handle . When Thor was repulsed he fled from the field , and Halfdan went with him . Thus did victory come to Svipdag , and thus was the judgment of the gods defied , for they had placed the workmanship of Sindre 's kinsman above that of the sons of Ivalde . Halfdan died of his wounds , and Thor made haste to Asgard , where the gods awaited the coming of Svipdag with the Sword of Victory , which had been forged so that they might be utterly overcome and Asgard laid waste .  | Triumph of Love Freyja and Frey in Captivity ?

Then he prepared to set out with Ull , his stepbrother , towards the giants ' country ? cold and darksome Jotun-heim . But ere he went , Sith made for the twain the food of wisdom with the fat of three serpents , so that they might be rendered able to perform their long and perilous journey .

When far from shore the storm-giant came against him , but Svipdag overcame him in combat . Protected by the incantations of Groa did Svipdag with Ull make the voyage in safety , until they reached a harbour nigh to the bleak castle of  | Beli , " the howler " , in which Freyja and Frey were imprisoned . Three sons of the giant met them on the strand . Each of them had Grep for name , and one , who was a skald , desired to have Freyja for his bride . With Svipdag and Ull he entered into angry dispute , and sought to prevail upon them to return from whence they came . But this they scorned to do , and in the end the giants retreated from the strand . Then went Svipdag and Ull towards the castle to seek for Freyja and Frey . The giants were filled with anger , and sought to affright the young heroes by howling like beasts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed fearsome , and none but brave hearts could have ventured to make entry to that place of horror . Within the court Frey and Freyja came to meet them , and they were surrounded by giant attendants . Svipdag greeted Freyja with a kiss , and she knew that she would become his bride . But enchantments had been put upon her and upon Frey by the giants . They had been given to drink the potion of forgetfulness , so that they had but vague . memory of the past , while deep discontent and haunting misery were their dower . Frey had deep shame upon him , and he sought nor flight nor expected happiness any more . In dark despair he lived within the strong castle of Beli . Freyja was pale and sorrow-stricken . In her heart was keen loathing , which tortured her , against the Grep who would fain be her favoured suitor . Her golden locks were twisted hard above her forehead , for Beli had thus punished her when he took her captive . In vain she had endeavoured to comb them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell that was put upon her she could not break . Her eyes were vacant and sad . She rejoiced not that Svipdag and Ull had come to rescue her , for her heart was cold and passionless . Svipdag and Ull entered the wide hall of the castle amidst the bestial howlings of the dread giants . A great fire burned there because of the bitter cold that prevailed . With the giants they sat at feast , and Frey was on a high seat with pale , unhappy face , while the giants sang loudly and drank deeply about him . Now deeply were these fierce furies incensed against Svipdag and Ull , whom they sought to overcome and put to death . In sharp dispute they engaged . At length , the Grep who wooed Freyja flung himself upon Svipdag , but Ull cut him down with his sword and slew him . Then many fought against Egil 's sons , but they were driven back . In the end the heroes prevailed upon Freyja to flee with them , but on Frey they could not prevail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not again appear , he said , before the gods in Asgard . To Svipdag was Freyja cold and indifferent , nor did she ever raise her eyes to look at him or open her lips to speak . When they had crossed the magic sea , they set out to climb the great mountains towards Orvandel 's home , where Sith awaited them ; but Freyja showed neither joy nor gratitude at her escape from the giants . Then was the heart of Svipdag filled with anger , and he left Freyja to wander alone . She went towards a desolate land which was the abode of giantesses , and was found by one , who took her for a slave to tend her goats . But Svipdag repented , and when his anger passed away he went again in search of Freyja , for his heart was moved with deep tenderness towards her .  | From the giantess he rescued her , and they went together on their way . But that great Hag followed quickly , and swift was the flight of the lovers , running on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but suddenly the sun rose over the mountains , and she was turned into a great boulder at the sea 's edge . In Freyja 's heart there was yet no gratitude , because of the spells that were upon her . Nor answer would she make when Svipdag spoke , nor would she gaze in his eyes to reward him . One brief look was all he desired , and yet she stared upon the ground disconsolate and silent . Again did Svipdag wax wroth and leave her to wander alone ; and she went down among the rocks . Then took she the guise of a bird and flew over the mountains and over the river that separates that wild country from the land in which Svipdag had his dwelling . She reached the house of Orvandel . To Sith , who recognized her not , she said that she was a poor woman who had no home , and she was received with welcome . But Svipdag knew her and claimed her for his bride , and a wedding feast was set , and the marriage oath sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionless . To the bridal chamber they went , and in her hand Freyja held a candle . She stood motionless before Svipdag until the candle burned low ; and when the flame stung her hand , Svipdag spoke words of warning . But Freyja felt not the pain because of the greater pain within her heart . Then was the spell broken by fire , and she raised her face and looked with eyes of love upon him who had rescued her . Thus had Svipdag his exceeding great reward .  | But Freyja vanished from before him , and in falconguise she soared to Asgard , undefiled and pure , and was received with rejoicing by the gods . Then did Svipdag take his Sword of Victory and set forth towards Asgard to win Freyja . But a sorrow no greater than when Freyja was lured away had fallen upon Asgard because the goddess Idun was lost . For it was she who had in her keeping the golden apples of eternal youth . In her fast-shut casket she kept them , and for each one she drew forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods receive immortality , and when Idun was taken away they began to grow old . Well they knew that both giants and trolls had much desire to rob the golden apples from Asgard . So they were sore troubled , fearing that disaster would fall speedily upon them . On evil Loke did suspicion fall , and when Odin challenged him , for Idun had last been seen in company with him , he confessed that he had delivered her to Thjasse-Volund , her brother , who had forged the Sword of Victory so that the gods might be overcome . ' T was thus it fell that Idun was taken from Asgard . One day there went forth together on a journey Odin and Honer and Loke . It was their desire to visit the country of Ivalde and his sons , beside Hvergelmer and the rivers Evilagar , so as to cause the conflict to have end . Thjasse-Volund , who had escaped from the bonds of Mimer in the guise of an eagle , had knowledge of their coming and waited for them . In a valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herd of bears , and one they caught on which to feast , for they hungered and were weary . The bear they slew , and when a fire was kindled they roasted it for their feast . Near by lay a magic rod which Thjasse-Volund had forged with intent  | to , wreak his vengeance upon the gods , and especially Loke . Then a great eagle came towards them , and the gods knew it was Thjasse-Volund who had dominion there . Hard was the bear to carve , for Ivalde 's son had put enchantments upon it , and of this had Odin full knowledge . So he addressed Thjasse and said : " Why hast thou done this , thou maker of ornaments in eagle guise ? " Thjasse said that he desired his share . Odin had not , however , any knowledge of the evil intent of the eagle , and consented that he should divide the meal with them . Whereupon Thjasse flew down and sought to take so large a share that Loke , in his wrath , seized the magic rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the eagle 's power . He could not unclasp his hands from the rod , and the other end was fixed in the claws of the eagle , which flew high , carrying Loke with him . In vain did he seek to be released , and over the oak trees was he dragged and sorely beaten until he was near to being torn to pieces . Loke was heavy and the eagle sank to the ground . Then Loke offered Thjasse any ransom he would demand if he would but let him escape , for he was compelled to plead for his life . Thjasse demanded his sister Idun , who had been taken away by Loke when the sons of Ivalde were the willing servants of the gods . Loke promised to deliver her to him secretly , and was then released by his dread captor . The gods returned to Asgard together , and evil Loke fulfilled his promise , nor gave Odin knowledge of his doings . Thus it came that when he made confession of his deed the gods were moved to anger against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Loke made vows  | to restore Idun to Asgard , and flew forth towards the dominion of Thjasse-Volund in the bird-guise of Freyja . The loss of ldun had dread effect in Midgard as in Asgard . Cold winds blew from the north . The power of the Frost-giants increased , and they swarmed southward in great hosts . Halfdan , they knew , was slain , and that the gods had loss of power because that Idun had been taken away . Icy arrows were shot over the earth , killing man and beast and each thing that grew . The heavens were disturbed . Nearer sun and moon crept the giant wolves . From Urd 's fountain was slowly departing the power to give warmth to the World-tree Ygdrasil . Out of Jotun-heim rose songs of rejoicing and vengeance that were heard in Asgard , and the gods , growing old , feared that the end of all things was drawing very nigh . To Mimer 's grove were sent swift messengers , so that from the Norns might be received knowledge of the world 's fate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer because Idun , the goddess of regeneration , was taken away . The death-cold stormspears were turned against gods and men . The murderfrost held Midgard with iron grasp . Idun was found by Loke in Thjasse 's dwelling , and he put enchantments upon her and she became a nut . Then he flew with her in his claws towards Asgard . But ere he set off , Loke , the tempter , made known to Thjasse what he had done , and challenged him to follow . In eagle-guise angry Thjasse pursued the god . So swiftly did he fly that he came very nigh to Loke ere yet he had reached the safety of Asgard . Then he flew midst the vafer-flames in the kindling vapour cloud , and fell scorched within the walls . Thor seized his hammer , which Sindre had again forged , and slew him . Thus did Thjasse-Volund , who had shaped the Sword of Victory ,  | fall in his shame and perish because of Loke 's evil doings . Meanwhile in Asgard did Freyja await the coming of Svipdag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he carried the Sword of Victory . Svipdag 's heart was filled with longing for Freyja , nor could he sleep or rest until he found her . The protection of Groa 's incantations was still upon him , and it was Urd 's will that he should reach Asgard . So he went again on a perilous journey . Unto Hela he went , over bleak tremendous mountains and through storms and blinding mist , until he reached the foundations of Bif-rost . Heimdal , the shining sentinel , beheld him as he stepped upon the Bridge of the Gods with the gleaming Sword of Victory girdled by his side . But no warning did he sound , for it was the will of Odin that Freyja 's lover should stand before the gate of Asgard . So Svipdag ascended until he beheld the ramparts of the celestial city . There he perceived Odin nor knew who he was . Roughly did the god receive his greetings . " This " , he said , " is no place for beggars ; return by the moist ways whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality , being a weary traveller , and Odin made answer again that he could not enter , although less harshly , for the noble bearing of the youth gave pleasure to his eyes . " From here , " cried Svipdag , " I can not turn my eyes away because of its exceeding great beauty . Here would I find happiness and peace . " " Who art thou ? " Odin asked . " My name , " said Svipdag , " is Windcold , and I am the son of Springcold , whose sire was Very-cold . " Now Svipdag had caught a radiant glimpse of Asgard 's beauties . He saw its halls of glittering gold , and especially  | the Hall of Gladness , which is the dwelling of Freyja , and is nigh to the gate . He also beheld Freyja , whom he loved , sitting on the flower-decked Rock of Joy , which gives health to those who seek it with prayer . She was surrounded by her maids ? Eil , the healer ; Hlif , the protectress ; Bjort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fair ? they had power to give healing to men and women who called upon them from Midgard and offered up sacrifices . Freyja was silent and in deep thought . Like a graven statue she sat in virgin beauty , blue-eyed with golden hair ? she who has care of lovelorn maidens and mothers and their babes . She wore her gleaming necklace which the elf-smiths had made with sparkling jewels of the sky and bright spring-flowers , for the fair goddess was " The Lover of Ornaments " . Freyja sat beneath the branches of Ygdrasil , and these Svipdag beheld with wonder . He saw its magical fruit , and in the branches sat the cock Goldcomb , with feathers of gleaming gold . Svipdag turned his eyes upon Asgard 's wondrous gate , and saw before it the two great wolf-dogs which kept watch by night and by day , for when one slept the other was awake . They had power to kill giants and put to flight through the air the flying trolls that came against Asgard in the darkness . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odin . " No stranger can come within , " the god made answer , " unless he brings with him the Sword of Victory . " " How can the dogs be passed ? " asked Svipdag . Odin made reply that no one could pass the dogs unless he could give them to eat of the flesh upon the legs of Goldcomb . When Svipdag asked how the cock which sat on the  | World-tree could be killed , Odin said that there was but one sword with which it could be slain , and it had been kept in Hela 's cave , nor could it be obtained from the watchman unless he were given the ankle bones of Goldcomb . " Can no man enter the city and go unto Freyja ? " the hero asked . " No man can enter , " was Odin 's answer , " save Svipdag . " " Then open the gates , " the hero cried , " for I am he . Svipdag has come to seek for Freyja . " Then he crossed the river unscathed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dogs fawned to him and bayed joyous welcome . From the rock on which she sat hastened Freyja , and when she knew that it was indeed Svipdag who had come , she cried : " Welcome , my lover ! Now is my great desire fulfilled . Long have I waited , sitting on the rock , looking for you by day and by night . All my desires are indeed fulfilled because you are once again by my side . " ' T was thus that Svipdag entered Asgard , bearing with him the Sword of Victory which had been forged to bring ruin to the gods . Love had triumphed over hate , and the designs of Loke were thwarted , for Svipdag had Freyja for his wife and the sons of Ivalde were reconciled to the gods . Then was Ull brought to Asgard , and Sith also . The eyes of Thjasse-Volund were placed in heaven to shine as stars , and Orvandel , who was dead , was also raised among the star-heroes . Meanwhile Njord had journeyed to Jotun-heim , where he rescued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrath did Frey kill Beli , " the howler " , with a stag 's horn  | which he plucked from the wall when the spells that bound him were taken off . To Frey was given by Svipdag the Sword of Victory , and the joy of peace fell upon Asgard when he returned . But still the Hag abode among the gods in the guise of a maid who sat at Freyja 's feet . It was fated that she would cause yet another and greater war in Asgard and in Midgard ere her power would be overcome .  | The Lost Sword of Victory The Wrath of Skade ? The Demand for Vengeance ?

The gods took counsel together , and deemed that her cause was just . Thus it came that they spoke words of peace unto her , and , indeed , they desired not to slay one so fair . But she scorned their entreaties , and , raising her spear , demanded the life of him who had slain her father .

Amidst the gods thou mayest now dwell , and one thou canst choose to be thy husband . But , when this thou shalt do , thine eyes must be blindfolded , so that his feet only may be beheld by thee . " On the assembled gods she gazed with wonder and delight . Her eyes fell on Balder the Beautiful , and him she loved . In her heart she vowed he would be her choice . When her eyes were veiled , she beheld a foot that was beautiful , and she deemed it was Balder 's . Her arms went out , and , crying : " Thee 1 wed , " she snatched aside the veil , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fair was Njord , the summer sea-god , who stilled the tempests of ' Eger and the blast of Gymer , the storm-giant of the bitter east . But the heart of Skade took no delight in Njord . Yet was the Vana-god her choice , and with him was she wed in pomp and state in Asgard . Together they departed to Noatun , where Skade wearied of the sea and the cries of birds on the cliffs , which bereft her of sleep . Deep was her sorrow that she dwelt no longer in the forest of Thrym-heim , and she yearned for the thundering waterfall , the high mountains , and the wide plains where Footnote  | she was wont to follow the chase . And the love she bore to Balder was ever gnawing her heart . Then sought Frey a bride , and with love of her he was possessed to madness . One day he ascended the golden throne of Odin and looked over the worlds , seeing all things , and that was the day of his sorrow . Wondering , he gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then northward towards the land of giants he turned his eyes , and there shone before him a light of great radiance that filled with beauty the heavens and the air and the sea . A maiden , fairer than ever he beheld before , had opened the door of her dwelling . Divinely tall was she , and her arms gleamed like silver . For a moment he saw her , his heart leaping with love , and then she vanished , whereat his soul was stricken with deep sadness . So was he punished for sitting in Odin 's throne . Homeward went Frey , nor speak would he , nor would he eat , or drink , so great was his love for the giant-maid , whose name was Gerd , the daughter of Gymer . Much did the gods marvel because of his silence and his deep sighs . But none could find reason for the madness of Frey . To him came his father Njord , and Skade also , and as they found him so they left him , in melancholy and possessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Asgard , was named Skirner , " the shining one " , and entreated him to discover what caused his son to suffer , and to find a remedy whereby he would be restored to gladness . As reluctant was Skirner to go unto Frey as he was when Sith besought him to rescue Freyja from the giant Beli . Yet when he found Frey sitting alone in silence , and stricken with keen longing for her whom he loved , he spoke to him boldly and with confidence .  | " Together " , he said , " we have had adventures in other days , and faithful should we now be one to another . Nor should there be any secret between us . Speak , 0 Frey , and tell me why you grieve alone and refuse to eat and to drink . " Frey answered him : " How can I disclose , fond friend , the secret of my sorrow . Bright shines the sungoddess over heaven , but cheerless to me are her f9 rays . But Skirner pressed him to confide his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerd , the giantmaid . But his love , he said , was foredoomed to sorrow , for neither god nor elf would permit that they should dwell together . Then went Skirner to the gods and revealed the secret of Frey 's silence and despair . Well they knew that if Gerd were not taken to him the god of sunshine would pine and die , so to Skirner they made known their will that he should haste to Gymer 's abode and win his fair daughter for Frey . Then was Frey less sad , and he gave Skirner the Sword of Victory to be his defence , and from Odin he received Sleipner to ride through fire and over the heavens . The bridal gifts he bore when he set forth were the magic ring Draupner and eleven apples of immortal youth from Idun 's precious casket . A magic rod which subdues took he also with him . Over raging sea and bleak mountains rode Skirner , over chasms and the mountain caves of fierce giants , until he came to Gymer 's Castle , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance gate . On a mound sat a shepherd alone , and him Skirner addressed , beseeching how he could lull the fearsome  | hounds that kept constant watch , so that he might reach the giant-maid . " Whence come ye ? " asked the shepherd ; " for surely you are doomed to die . You may ride by night or by day , but never can you win nigh to Gerd . " Skirner had no fear . " Our fates , " he said , " are spun when we are born . Our doom we can never escape . Now was the voice of Skirner heard by Gerd , who was within , and she besought her maid-servant to discover who it was that spoke so boldly before the castle . Then Skirner spurred his horse , which rode over the hounds and the fiery moat , and the castle was shaken to the foundations when the door was reached . The maid-servant told Gerd that a warrior stood without and demanded to be admitted to her . " Then haste , " cried Gerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the sweet and ancient mead , for I fear that he who murdered Beli , my brother , is come at length . " Skirner entered and stood before the giant-maid whom Frey loved so well , and she spake to him and said : " Who art thou ? an elf , or the son of an Asa-god , or one of the wise Vans ? Daring , indeed , art thou , to come alone unto this our strong abode . " " Neither elf , nor god , nor Van am I , " Skirner made answer . " I am a messenger from the god Frey , who loves thee . From him 1 bring the ring Draupner as a gift , for he seeks thee for his bride . " Then was Gerd 's heart filled with disdain , and the bridal gift she refused to take . " While life remains in me , " she said , " Frey I shall not wed .

" Proudly did Gerd arise . " By force nor threat , " said she , " will I ever be led . My strong sire Gymer is armed and ready to punish thee for thy boldness . " Then Skirner said wrathfully : " With this blade 1 shall slay thy sire , the old giant Gymer , if he should dare to oppose me . And thee I can conquer with this magic wand , which shall subdue thy heart . If I must needs do so , no happiness will ever again come nigh thee . For thee it will remove to the regions of Nifel-hel , where nor god nor man can ever behold thee in beauty again . " Silent and pale sat Gerd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she continued to refuse to become the bride of Frey . The place in Nifel-hel to which she must go , he said , was a region of torture where dwell the spirits of the giants who were ground in the World-mill . Power to love she would not have , nor tenderness or sympathy . Alone she must live , or else as the fruitless bride of a monstrous three-headed giant . Gladness and enjoyment would be banished from her heart . Staring eyes would ever watch her coldly and with more hatred than do the Frost-giants regard Heimdal , the sentinel of Bif-rost , or do the Trolls the wolf-dogs of Odin . Nor would the demons ever leave her at peace . Evil witches would bow her to the rocks . Morn , who gives " agony of soul " , would fill her being . There in the place of torment prepared for her dwell the demons of sickness ,  | who would increase her sorrow .

" Fulfil not thy threat , " she pleaded , " and drink of this sweet and ancient mead . Never dreamed I that I should love a god of the Vans . " But Skirner would not be appeased until she gave to him a message to Frey .

" Slowly for Frey passed the days and nights that followed . Then at the appointed time he went to Gerd , who became his bride . Unto Gymer he gave for his daughter the Sword of  | Victory , which had been forged to bring disaster upon the gods . And in this manner was Asgard deprived of the fruit of the triumph which Freyja had brought thither when Svipdag 's wrath was turned aside and his love for her caused peace to be made between gods and elves . Long had the giants sought to possess the Sword of Victory , and especially the wife of Gymer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had still her dwelling in Asgard , where she ever strove to work evil . For with the Sword of Victory will Surtur be armed when he issues forth to avenge the wrong done to Gunlad by Odin . Thus did Loke taunt Frey . " Treasure gave you to Gymer with which to buy his daughter , and the Sword of Victory also . Lo ! when the sons of Surtur come over Ironwood , in sore distress you shall indeed be , for then you shall know not , 0 unhappy one , with what weapon to fight .

THE gods marvelled greatly at the disasters which had befallen them , and they sat in council together to discover how Freyja had been lured from Asgard , and who had plotted to work this evil . Suspicion fell upon Loke 's wife , Aurboda-GulveigHoder , the Hag of Ironwood , who dwelt among the gods in the guise of a maid-attendant to Freyja . Wife she was also to Gymer , who had become possessed of the Sword of Victory , and her son was Beli , the howler " , whom Frey had slain . So well did she act her part , while she schemed to work evil , that among the maids none seemed fairer or more faithful . Many missions did she perform for Freyja . Once , indeed , she was sent to confer divine favour upon mortals . A king and queen had long been married , and they had no children . Prayers they offered up to Freyja , and sacrifices made they that an heir to the kingdom might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aurboda was sent  | earthwards by Freyja in the guise of a crow , bearing with her the fruit of fertility from the branches of Ygdrasil . When the queen partook of it , her desire was fulfilled , and in due season an heir was born , whereat there was great rejoicing in the kingdom . Thus Aurbodai had fair repute in Asgard despite her evil character ? she who was mother of the wolves that pursue son and moon ; she who was Hag of Eastern Winds which bear the burden of her fearsome song and drive fair vessels into the very jaws of IEgir , the stormgod of western ocean . When the gods came to know she was indeed the Mother of Evil , and had lured Freyja from her secure abode , they were moved with ' great wrath and with horror against her . They found , too , that it was dread Aurboda who had filled the air with witchcraft and wrought evil spells that enchanted both gods and men . Black sorcery did she practise to stir up the evil passions with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the High Thingstead of the gods and went forth hastily to find her . By him was she seized and struck down . Then the gods burned her as punishment for her witchcraft . A great pyre they reared in Valhal , and they spitted her body with their spears , holding it over the flames until it was consumed . But she came to life again . Thrice they burned her and thrice was she restored , for evil is hard to destroy . The third time they flung her ashes away , but her heart , which is the seat of life , was but half-burned , and Loke found it and swallowed it . Thereafter he partook in still greater measure of the evil character of the Hag , who , however , came to life the third time in Ironwood , where she must ever dwell despite the vengeance of the gods and their Footnote  | wrathful desire to destroy her . But Asgard she could never again enter . Now the Hag was the mother of Gerd , the giant maid whom Frey the Vana-god had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was under the protection of the Vana-gods , although , like the Asa-gods , they had fear and hatred of her witchcraft . They therefore began to dispute with the Asa-clan because the Hag had been burned . Long and loud the quarrel waged , but suddenly it was brought to an end by Odin , who flung his spear into their midst to signify that the war of words must end and the war of arms ensue . Thus was the breach between the gods accomplished by the fearsome Hag . On earth , too , was a conflict begun between the tribes of men . Thus came to be waged , as skalds have sung , " the first great war in the world " . Whereat the primeval cold heart of " the old one in the Ironwood " was made glad . With her rejoiced Egther , " the swordguardian " , who is also named Gymer , and is shepherd of her foul herds . On the Day of Vengeance , when Surtur prepares to issue forth , Egther shall be visited by Fjalar-Suttung , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain from him the Sword of Victory with which to slay the gods . Now when the Vans became hostile to the Asa-gods , they issued forth from Asgard . With them went Njord . Skade , his wife , refused to dwell any more with him when she found she had no longer need to fear the Asagods . She wearied of the western seashore , for she loved Thrym-heim , the domain of Thjasse-Volund , her father , with its serene mountains and wide plains and forests of oak . For nine days and nine nights would Njord go with her to the mountains , and then for a time would she  | dwell with him beside the loud-voiced sea . Njord hated Thrym-heim as she did Noatun , and with heavy heart he sang : I am weary of the mountains , The barren plains and lone , And dismal chasms of the winds Where fettered demons groan ; I am weary of the forests And the wolves that howl by night , For I love the singing of the swans Upon the ocean bright , The flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the kingdom of Njord did Skade sing : 0 never mine eyes are closed in sleep On my lonesome couch by the sea , For the clamour the restless seagulls keep Is weary and strange to me . I pine for my mountains free , and the woods , For the snow-clad plains and the chase ; And I hate the cold-lipped shore that broods In the shifting sea 's embrace . So Skade parted with Njord and went towards her ancient home , from which she never returned . When the star-eyes of Thjasse-Volund are gleaming bright in heaven , and winds are abroad , she runs on her skees adown steep mountain slopes ; and with her arrows and her spear she hunts the bear and the wolf in dim forests and over snow-white plains . Mighty Njord was leader of the Vans in their war against the Asa-gods . And to the Vans was it given to triumph . In sore plight were Odin and his strong warriors , for the Sword of Victory was no longer theirs , and the hammer of Thor had been broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyr and all the gods of Odin 's clan defend Asgard . Loke usurped Honer , for he desired to rule over the Vana-gods . Mimer , in the Underworld , was ever faithful unto Odin . So the Vana-gods slew him , and to Odin they sent his head , and the great Asa-god embalmed it . Then sang he sacred runes , so that in after time Odin spake with Mimer 's head , and heard words of wisdom from it , and received guidance as of old . Honer was sent unto Mimer 's realm , where he spoke without confidence or clear knowledge , but he had not chosen his part . Asgard fell , and by cunning strategy was it taken . Unscathed by the vafer-flames did the Vans cross its fearsome river , for Njord burst open the mighty gate with his great battleaxe and caused it to fall . So did the Vans achieve gigantic triumph . It was thus that the gods were overcome . Before Asgard their foes assembled , and skirmishings there were when Odin 's warriors issued forth . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bridged the river , and a god rode forth upon Sleipner . But in ambush was he taken by Njord , and he leapt from his horse and hastened back to Asgard , crossing the bridge , which was hastily raised again . But Sleipner was captured , whereat there was sorrow and deep foreboding in Asgard . Next morning the gods found Odin 's horse outside the gate , and they rejoiced and took it within . The robes of Njord they saw also in the river , and what they thought to be his dead body , so they deemed themselves secure . But Njord was already in Asgard . He had gone to the river , horsed on Sleipner , in the darkness of night . There he slew his attendant and wrapped his own kingly robes about him , throwing the body into the dread waters .  | Whereupon he crossed over on Sleipner , unscathed by the vafer-flames , scaled the great wall , and concealed himself within the High Thingstead of the gods . When he came to know of the gods ' plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crept forth and struck the gate with his battleaxe . Across the river it fell like a bridge , and over it surged the conquering Vana-gods . Thus did they become possessed of Asgard , the celestial city . Njord was chief of heroes , and with him fought Frey and Ull , the warlike son of Sith , and Svipdag , Freyja 's husband . Frigg espoused the cause of the Vana-gods , her kinsmen , and remained in Asgard . l Odin made swift escape on the back of Sleipner , and Thor yoked his goats , and in his thundering car departed with those who remained faithful to his sire . Thus were the Asa-gods bereft of their power , and thus became the Vana-gods the world-rulers in Asgard . Ull was chosen as the chief , and to him did mortals offer up prayers and sacrifices . Then did wicked men , by reason of great offerings which they made , seek to win Hela 's secure abode . While the war was waged about Asgard there were mighty conflicts in Midgard , for Halfdan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ere the tale of the battles be told it must needs be known how the war upon earth came to be . When Halfdan was wounded unto death , in the great fight in which Svipdag overcame Thor with the Sword of Victory , his forces were driven hither and thither . He had two sons ? Hadding , whose mother was Signe-Alveig , and Gudhorm , whose mother was Groa . They were in Footnote  | great peril when Halfdan died , and Thor carried them unto Jotun-heim . Gudhorm he gave to the giant Halfe , and Hadding to the giant Vagnhofde , so that they might be cared for until they became great warriors . When the Vans conquered Asgard , Loke sought to win their favour . He perceived that they were scorned by Hadding 's tribe , whom Saxons called " the ' Heardings " , and he laid snares against Hadding . But there came to Hadding one day a tall old man with one eye , who rode a great horse . He lifted Halfdan 's son into his saddle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off with him . So swiftly did the horse travel , and yet so smoothly , that the lad was curious to know whither they were going . There was a small hole in the horseman 's mantle , and when Hadding peered through he saw the wide ocean far beneath and the clouds about him . Fear filled his heart and he trembled , and the rider bade him to look not forth again . For it was Odin who had rescued Hadding , and he bore him to the place of refuge which the gods had selected when they were driven out of Asgard . Odin trained Halfdan 's son to become a great leader of men . Over him he sang magical incantations which had power to free him from fetters and chains . He also gave him to drink of the Splendid Draught , which was called " Leifner 's Flames " . Its virtue was such that it imparted to Hadding strength beyond that of all men , and bravery that was unequalled . Then did Odin warn him that he would soon have need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Odin 's horse , as he had come , to the home of the giant Vagnhofde . But soon he fell into Loke 's snare . The evil god seized him and chained him in a forest , as Svipdag had been chained by Halfdan ,  | so that he might become the prey of wild beasts . Guards were set over him to prevent his escape . But when these allies of Loke kept watch , Halfdan sang an incantation which Odin had taught him , and they fell into a magic sleep . A great wolf came towards him to tear his body to pieces , and he sang the incantation which makes free , and his chains and fetters fell from him . Then he attacked the wolf and killed it , and its heart he did eat . With the might and ferocity of the wolf was Hadding then endowed , and the guards he slew , and went upon his way . He returned to the giants ' home , and prepared to depart so that he might raise his tribe to battle against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , loved him and besought him not to leave her . She had power to change her shape . Now she had stature which reached to the stars , and anon she was of human size . In vain did she remonstrate with Hadding because he scorned her love and sought to follow arms , thirsting for throats . But although at length she gained his love as a comely maid , he had still resolve to be gone . So she attired herself as a male warrior and went with him . Then did Svipdag come from Asgard , and he sought to make peace with the sons of Halfdan . To both he offered kingdoms , and his half-brother Gudhorm , son of Groa , he made ruler over the Danes . But Hadding refused his favours , and with anger and fierce scorn he vowed that he would avenge his father 's death and take no favour from the hands of his enemy . Until his life 's purpose was fulfilled he vowed to cut neither hair nor beard , and long were both and very fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the hairy " His eastern tribe of Swedes did the young warrior  | raise to battle against Svipdag 's tribe and their allies , and war he declared against his brother Gudhorm , King of the Danes . Between the two brothers did Loke work much evil . As a blind man he went to Hadding with words his brother uttered , and with Gudhorm he was Bikke , a leader of his army . So the brothers fought one against another . To Gudhorm 's aid went Halfe , the giant who had nourished him , and to Hadding 's went Vagnhofde . Svipdag 's Scandian tribe fought with the Danes . On the night before the battle the opposing armies beheld the great hairless giants contending in mid-air , the starlight gleaming on their bald , horrible heads . Monstrous were . the efforts of these foul gigantic warriors . When the dread conflict was ended , victory was with Halfe . On the morrow did Loke set in cunning battle array the forces of Gudhorm , which triumphed on the field as Halfe had in mid-air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugitive in the woods . With him was Hardgrep , the giant 's daughter , who was a constant protection to him . Great hardships did they endure together , and they were ofttimes in peril . But her aid he was doomed to lose . One night they entered a lonely dwelling to seek hospitality , and there they found that the master of the house was lying dead . His funeral rites were being performed . Now , it was Hardgrep 's desire to peer into the future , and she took a piece of wood and on it engraved magic runes , which she caused Hadding to place under the dead man 's tongue , so that he might speak . Angry , indeed , was the spirit thus compelled to make utterance . Nor did it reveal what was sought , but cursed  | the worker of the spell . Terrible was the voice that spoke and said : " Cursed be the one who dragged me back from the Underworld ! Let her perish by the demon who called a spirit out of bale ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge in the deep forest . Over the narrow path of a grove they made a shelter with branches of trees and concealed themselves there . In the middle of the night a rustling was heard in their secret dwelling , and a Great Black Hand was perceived to move about , groping with iron fingers for its prey . Hadding was stricken with terror , and he awakened Hardgrep and besought her to rescue him . Swiftly rose the giant-maid , and she assumed great stature to defend her lover . With strength of her kind she clutched the Great Hand round the ' wrist , and bade Hadding strike it with his sword . Many blows did he give , seeking to hew it off , and his blade rang noisily against the hard flesh . Blood flowed from the wounds he made , but more venom than blood came forth . Then suddenly was Hardgrep caught by the Hand , which clutched her in terrible embrace .

Soon again did Hadding appear in the east , leading his hosts to battle .  | The Gods Reconciled Svipdag leaves Asgard ? Hadding 's Strategy ? Fleet sunk by Odin ? Fate of Svipdag ?

SVIPDAG descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danes in their campaign against Hadding . Ing was he called by his people . They were ruled over by his son , Asmund , who had chosen to live among men . The fame of Hadding had already gone forth because of mighty deeds he had done . He had conquered King Hadvanus , although the city in which he was besieged was protected by strong battlements . The cunning warrior desired the speedy surrender of his foemen . He caused birds that nested within to be caught , and to their feathers slow-burning lights were attached , so that when they flew over the battlements they set the roofs aflame . The people hastened to quench the great fires that raged about them ; soldiers left the fortresses , and the guards ran from the gates . Then did Hadding make sudden and fierce assault and capture the town . Not until he gave payment of much gold was the stricken king ransomed and saved from death . A great fleet sailed eastward with Svipdag 's warriors.  | In one ship , the name of which was Gnod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all on board perished in the waves . There are some who tell that Svipdag was drowned with his warriors , and there are others who hold that he was punished by enchantments , for by reason of Groa 's incantations the sea could not harm him , and none there were who had power over him save the Asa-gods . Indeed he had reason to fear them greatly , for they were stirred with wrath against him because he would not permit the war to have end . He was Odur , the one " endowed with spirit " . It is told that enchantments were put upon Svipdag by the Asa-gods , and that he was transformed into a great sea-dragon which dwelt beneath a grey rock guarding much treasure . The heart of Freyja was sad because that Svipdag came not nigh to her with loving words and shining face . Deeply she yearned for him in Asgard , wondering what evil had befallen The Shining One . Then came she to know that he had suffered because of Odin 's wrath , and forth she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they became drops of pure gold , and those that showered into the sea were changed to amber . Through Midgard she went searching for Svipdag , and she roamed over hills and plains and over rivers and lakes enquiring of whom she met if her lost one had gone this way or that . And without ceasing she wept , so that her tears of gold may be found in all lands , and her tears of amber on the shores of wide seas . Faithful was she to Svipdag , and ever did she sorrow as she went because she found him not . At length she came to the shore of the sea where her  | husband sorrowed also in dragon-guise . Horrible was he to behold and of haggard seeming . She was neither repulsed nor was her love turned cold , for the eyes of the dragon were still the eyes of Svipdag , without change or lack of beauty . Then endeavoured she to comfort him , and wept more tears of gold . Great indeed did the dragon 's treasure become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spell she could not , for who can remove the curse of Odin ? Long she stayed nigh to Svipdag , nor sought to return unto Asgard . And when she entered the sea to comfort him her great necklace glittered through the waves , and in darkness fire flashed from it . Beneath the grey stone ' she left the necklace on the day when lasting sorrow was her dower . There came on that day to bathe in the sea Hadding , the vengeful son of Halfdan . But he wondered because his body was scorched with great heat and the waves boiled all around . Then suddenly he beheld the dragon coming against him . With haste he seized his sword and made fierce attack . Great was the might of Hadding , and by Odin was he given power to prevail . With many strong blows he slew the monster , and he bade his men to carry it to his camp . Now , as he went thither , a lady came towards him . She was of such great beauty that he was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming and blue were her eyes as the radiant , sun-kissed sea . But Hadding knew not that it was the goddess Freyja who stood before him . When she beheld the dragon she was stirred to divine wrath . Hadding she cursed upon sea and upon land . " Suffer shalt thou , " she cried , " the vengeance of  | the gods in Asgard . On battlefield and empty plain shall their wrath attend thee . On seas eternal tempests shall thee follow . Wherever thou dost wander thou shalt be accursed . Bitter cold shall follow thee to thy dwelling ; at its fire thou shalt be oppressed . Thy flocks shall die . All men shall shun thee , for through the world thou shalt go as foul and as hated as is the plague . Such is the wrath of the gods against thee , for with sacrilegious hands thou hast slain a dweller in Asgard who was enchanted in a form that was not his own . 0 slayer of the god I loved ! when thou art cast into the deep the wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under our curse until with prayers and sacrifice to the Vanagods our wrath is appeased . " All things that Freyja said came to pass . Stricken was Hadding by a tempest and cast into the raging sea . Despised was he by strangers when he was washed ashore , and shunned was he as if he were plague-smitten and foul . Many disasters , indeed , fell upon him , until he offered up dusky men in sacrifice to the god Frey . Then was the wrath of the Vana-gods melted and the curse removed . Each year did Hadding ever afterwards give Frey great offerings , as did also his sons and their sons for generations . Now Loke had watched the conflict between Hadding and the dragon while yet afar off . When he perceived that Svipdag was slain , he hastened to secure the treasure , and especially the necklace of Freyja , from below the grey rock . In seal guise did he enter the sea , and he saw gleaming through the dark waters the jewels of the divine Lover of Ornaments . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal guise was he also . Thus did Loke and he meet in the sea 's dim depths . By their  | eyes did each know the other , and fiercely they fought on the grey rock to be possessed of the jewels . Heimdal , son of the waves , was victorious . He drave off Loke , and possessed himself of Freyja 's necklace , which he kept secure until he returned to Asgard with the Asa-gods . Then came the day of great battle between Hadding and the tribes that were combined against him . Ere it began , he slew Henry , son of Asmund , son of Svipdag . Then was Asmund filled with great wrath , and he vowed to slay the warrior who had killed his sire and his son also . But Odin was with Hadding , and the great god caused his favoured warrior to marshal his army in wedge shape , so as to pierce and scatter the foe . For long years after did the descendants of Hadding enter battle in this manner . Now when the conflict was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of Asmund 's arm , which was made greater by his exceeding great wrath and desire for vengeance . Odin perceived his peril , and hastened from the battle to bring him aid . The Vana-gods gave help to Asmund , and over Hadding 's army there passed a fierce rainstorm and wreaths of mist that caused confusion . Then came Thor on a black thundercloud which drave back the rainclouds over the hills , and the sun broke forth in clear splendour . Hadding 's wedge-shaped army pressed forward , until Asmund was nigh to his enemy , whose death he sought above all else . Then did Hadding call upon the Asagods in his sore need . Asmund had flung his shield over his back , and with both hands grasping the hilt , he wielded his great sword so fiercely that he mowed down  | his enemies before him . Nigh to Hadding came he indeed , when Odin returned on his horse Sleipner , bearing with him the giant Vagnhofde . By Hadding 's side was the giant placed in the guise of a warrior bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant wielded he cried : " Thou mayest fight with a crooked sword , but my short sword and my javelin shall be thy doom this day . And thou , Hadding , holding thy shield against me , art foul with crimes . Thy bold lance shall I bear down , and thee shall I cover with shame . " But the giant engaged Asmund , and Hadding flung his lance , which pierced Asmund 's body so that he fell dying of his fierce wound . Yet was he not without strength to strike a last blow , for he grasped his javelin and flung it at Hadding , whose foot he pierced . Then died Asmund unrevenged , but ever afterwards did the slayer of his sire and his son limp with the wound he gave him in his last hour . When Asmund fell , Hadding became victorious , and his foemen he drave in confusion from the field . The body of Asmund was buried with pomp and state . Bitter was the grief of his queen Gunnhild , who desired not to live after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with him was she laid in the tomb . She loved him more than life , and with her arms around his body was she laid to rest in his tomb . The whole tribe mourned them , sorrowing greatly for many days . Now the Frost-giants and the giants of the mountains plotted together to conquer Asgard , and in Surtur 's deep dales and in larnvid there was promise and offer of help . Weak were the Vana-gods to resist the disaster which impended , nor did they know aught of the evil plans of their dread foes . But to Odin came full knowledge in  | his exile . Well he knew that disaster irretrievable would befall both gods and mortals if the high celestial city fell before the giants . Sleipner he mounted , and towards Asgard sped he , bearing the tidings of dread import . Then it was that the Vana-gods knew they had exceeding great need of his wise and constant counsel . Deeply moved were they towards the leader they had dethroned and driven into exile , because he had forewarned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who sat in Odin 's throne , and together they conferred . With eloquent words did the Thunder-god fill the heart of Ull with friendship towards the Asa-gods , so that he returned to Asgard to plead their cause . Nor long did he speak when the Vana-gods sent speedily unto Odin to beseech him to become once again their great chief ruler . So were the Asas and Vans reconciled , but on the day of Ragnarok , when Suttung comes forth to wreak vengeance , the wise Vans shall depart from Asgard . Soon after Odin had returned to sit supreme again upon his throne , the giants made vain attempt to overcome the gods , but great punishment was meted out to them for their presumption . Many were slain , and those that survived were driven back to Jotun-heim . Then peace unbroken reigned in Asgard . In Midgard , too , was peace restored , and men laid down their arms , weary with fighting . Odin then , remembering the evil wrought by the Hag of larnvid , issued decrees which condemned magic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by evil men did he also condemn , and he made known that not only by the quantity of offerings would the gods be appeased or the wicked recommended before the  | Thingstead of the Lower World . Those of his chosen warriors who were borne by the Valkyries to his place of exile were brought unto Asgard to share the joys of Valhal . So ended the first great war in the world . But the dread effects of Loke 's evil had not yet their end . When Mimer was slain , the fount of wisdom was without a watchman , and Ygdrasil , the World - tree , ceased to draw sustenance therefrom , so that it began to wither . Many leaves faded , and its branches knew swift decay . The seven sons of Mimer , who were guardians of the seven months of change , ' fell into deep stupor in their golden hall , which was heaped with great treasure . Clad in splendid robes , they lay upon the floor wrapped in magic sleep . Sindre-Dvalin was there in the midst ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reached Mimer 's realm have beheld them lying asleep beside their treasure , but they feared to enter ; for if anyone touched the robes , or sought to be possessed of the gold , his hand and his arm would wither . The Seven Sleepers shall awake not , as mortals have been told , until Ragnarok , " the Dusk of the Gods " . When Heimdal blows a thunder blast from Gjallarhorn on the day of the Last Battle , the sons of Mimer shall start from sleep . They shall then arm themselves and issue forth . On the wall have mortals beheld suspended and bright , seven long swords which none save the sons of Mimer can wield . Footnote  | Loke 's Evil Progeny Ironwood Brood ?

Now by divination did Odin come to know that in Ironwood the Hag , Angerboda ( Gulveig-Hoder ) was rearing the dread progeny of Loke with purpose to bring disaster to the gods . Three monster children there were ? Fenrer , the wolf ; Jormungand , the Midgard serpent ; and Hel . From these the Trolls are sprung . Together the gods took counsel , and a Vala revealed dimly the fate that would he theirs if these monsters were not overcome , for the wolf , it was foretold , would slay Odin , Thor would fall in combat with the serpent , and Hel would come with the hosts of destruction against the gods and men . So it was deemed of great import that the foul children of Loke and Angerboda should be brought to Asgard , and by Odin was Hermod sent to Ironwood to take them captive . That he did right speedily , bringing them one by one . When Odin beheld the foul serpent , which was yet young , but of great length and very fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far over the walls of Asgard.  | Yet by reason of its terrible weight it did not pass beyond the world 's edge , but fell into the depths of Ocean , where in after-days it grew and grew until it encircled the world of men . There on the sea bottom it lies , holding its tail in its mouth . When it shakes itself the waves rise in great fury and surge high upon the world 's shores . Next came Hel , and foul was she of aspect , for one-half of her body was of hue like to raw flesh , while the other was livid and horrible . In wrath did Odin seize her also , and he flung her afar . Beyond the edge of Ocean she went , falling through space , until she reached the black depths of Nifel-hel . There in the realms of torture became she a queen . High are the walls and strongly barred the gates of her habitation , which is named Hel-heim and also Elvidner , the Place of Storm . The doomed have terror of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About her are her servants , who do her will . Delay is her man servant and Slowness her maid servant ; Hunger waits at her table , and her knife is Starvation . The threshold of Hel 's home is Precipice , her bed is Care , while Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her apartment . Unto Elvidner , as it hath been told , went the doomed ere they were committed to the realms of torture . By Hel were their punishments ordered according to the judgments passed upon them . And especially to her came trembling , warmen who died without valour and were unworthy , as did also those who were traitors in the hour of trial . Now when the wolf Fenrer was brought to Odin , he sought not to destroy it . Indeed it was reared by the gods in Asgard ; but when it grew large , it became  | so fierce that none save brave Tyr had courage to feed it . The day fell when Odin perceived that the wolf must needs be overcome , or else it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terror in Asgard . Then the gods caused to be made an iron chain which was named Leding . Tyr bore it to Fenrer , who knew well its purpose . Without resistance was it bound , and when that was done the gods were well pleased . Then rose Fenrer to struggle with the chain , which it snapped right speedily . So the wolf again went free , and grew more ferocious than ever . Another chain , which was named Dromi , was thereafterwards made by the artisans of the gods . It had double the strength of Leding . Then went Tyr to the fierce wolf , and constrained it to be bound . " If this chain by thee is burst , " Tyr said , " then will thy mighty strength be proved indeed . " Well did the wolf know that the second chain was more powerful than the first , and that it could not easily be snapped . But much had Fenrer grown in bulk and in strength after Leding was broken . So the monster lay down , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The gods stood nigh and deemed the wolf secure forever . . . . They saw it rise and struggle fiercely without avail . Then it rolled upon the ground in monstrous strife , until at length the chain burst asunder and Fenrer was again free . More fierce than ever , and more terrible did the wolf become . Thus had origin the proverb that men use in dire straits when they know that wondrous efforts must needs be made : " I must now get loose from Leding , and burst free out of Dromi " . In despair were the gods when they saw Fenrer  | again at liberty , and they feared he would never be bound . Then did Odin give to Hermod his horse Sleipner , and him did the wise god send unto the Underworld , so that he might prevail upon the dark artisans of the gods to fashion the cord Gleipner , " the devourer " . Readily indeed did the cunning workers give Odin their service . Soft as silk was the cord they made , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no noise . Of six things was it made : A mountain 's root , A bear 's sinews , The breath of fish , A cat 's footfall , A woman 's beard , The spittle of birds . " Of all these things thou mayest not have heard before , " a skald has said , " yet a mountain hath no roots , fish breathe not , and cats make no noise when they run . Women have no beards , as thou halt seen . Soft and smooth was the cord indeed ; but yet of exceeding great strength . Hermod bore it to Asgard with great speed , and by Odin was he thanked for his service . Then did the gods challenge Fenrer to a supreme trial of strength . To the depths of Nifel-hel they went , and to the Gulf Amsvartner , which means " black grief " . In the gulf is an island , and on the island a misty grove , with trees shaped from jets of water sent forth by boiling springs . To the island did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord Gleipner . Each of them in turn tried its strength but could not snap it .  | " None but thee , 0 Fenrer , can break cord , " Odin said . The wolf answered : " Methinks no great fame can come to me from breaking such a cord , so light and slender does it seem . " Then with fierce eyes it spake thus : " If the cord is made with magic cunning , although it seems slender , never shall I permit it to bind my feet . " The gods answered , and said : " Surely Fenrer can burst asunder a cord both silken and light , when it hath already severed chains of iron . " The wolf made no answer , watching them sullenly with fiery eyes . " If thou canst break this cord , " Odin said , " then shall the gods know that they have no cause to fear thee , and then may well set thee at liberty . " The wolf answered sullenly , and said : " Much I fear that if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shalt not haste to unloose me . Loath indeed am I to be bound with this cord . But I am not without courage . Know now that I shall give consent to be bound if a god but place his hand in my mouth , as a sure undertaking that ye practise no deceit towards me . " At one another the gods looked in silence . No choice had they between two evils , and they knew that the wolf must needs be bound . Then stepped forth brave Tyr , the valiant god without fear , and between the fierce jaws of the monster wolf he placed his strong right hand . Thereupon the gods bound Fenrer with the soft silk-like cord of magic power . Securely they tied him ; his legs they fettered so that he could not rise . Holding Tyr 's right hand in its jaws , the wolf then began to struggle with purpose to break free from the  | magic bonds . Great wrath possessed its heart because its efforts were vain . No loop could be displaced , nor knot unloosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain , for the more it sought to be free , the tighter became the cords . Blood streamed from Tyr 's hand , and in the end Fenrer gnawed it off at the wrist . When the gods perceived that the wolf was bound indeed , all of them save Tyr shook with great laughter . A gallow-chain , named Gelgja , was then fixed to the cord , and the gods drew it through a black rock named Gjoll , which was sunk deep in the earth . The other end of the cord they tied to Thviti , a great boulder , which was buried still deeper . The wolf was then so well secured that it could not move . Yet it snapped its jaws , endeavouring to sever chains and cord ; and , perceiving this , the gods thrust in its evil mouth a great sword . It pierced the under jaw up to the very hilt , and the point touched the monster 's palate . Then did the wolf 's struggles come to an end , and horribly did it howl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to fall , which ever after fed the great and turbulent River Von . To guard the island of the Gulf of Black Grief the gods bound there , nigh to Loke 's monster son , the great watchdog Garm , which is greater than Hate-Managarm , the moon devourer , so that it might bark with loud alarm if Fenrer broke free . There , too , beside the fettered wolf , was Loke bound in after days . Now when Loke fell to dispute with Tyr he said : " Thy two hands thou canst not use , since thy right one was taken from thee by the wolf . " To him did Tyr make answer : " A hand I lack , but thou , 0 Loke , dost lack a good reputation . That is indeed a great defect . But the wolf fares not well .  | On the island of the Gulf of Black Grief it shall pine in fetters until the world 's end : " Loke was angered and spoke bitterly . " Thy wife " , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou mischief maker ! I see Fenrer , thy offspring , lying fettered at the source of Von , where it shall remain until the gods perish and all things have end . If thy tongue is not silent , then shalt thou be bound also . " It was then that Loke taunted Frey for giving unto the giant Gymer the Sword of Victory as a gift for Gerd . Wroth was Bygver , who served Frey , when he heard the words that Loke uttered . He it was who ground the barley for those who give honour to his master , the god of harvests . " Were I the honoured Frey , " he said unto Loke , " I would grind thee finer than sand , thou evil crow ! I would crush thee limb by limb . " But Loke turned , with wrinkling lips and cold disdain , and said : " What child is this ? What parasite starts up before me ? Ever in Frey 's hearing he clatters from under the millstone . " " My name is Bygver , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I called nimble . " Loke answered : " Be silent , Bygver ! never couldst thou divide fairly food between men . Ugly indeed is thy slave wife Beyla , who is ever filthy with dust and dirt . " Valiant was Tyr , whose sire was Odin and whose mother was a beauteous giantess of the deep . Brave men honoured him , and by Saxons was he called Saxnot . With Odin did heroes name him ere they entered battle , and when they were victorious they offered up to Tyr burnt sacrifices of war prisoners . On earth his temple  | symbol was the sun-flashing sword which he wielded , and on the swords of warriors were his runes graven . Thus hath a skald sung : The runes of Tyr give victory And these we needs must lilt When on the guard a sword we rist , Or on the blazing hilt . When we the magic words engrave , Twice name we Tyr , the wise , the brave .

How Thor was baffled ? The Broken Goblet ? Hymer 's Kettle captured ? Flight of Thor and Tyr ? A Running Battle ? Mead for the Feast . ) GIR , the Ocean Storm-god , had long heard of the fame and wisdom of Odin and his Asa clan , and there fell a day when he went to visit them . Thus it came that vows of lasting friendship were sworn between them . The gods were in due season invited to a harvest-end feast in the dwelling of the storm-god in the midst of the Western Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hall that Thor and Tyr set forth to do valiant deeds in the realm of the giant Hymer . The kingdom of IEgir is beyond Noatun , the safe ship haven of the god Njord , which ever had peace save when it was visited by Skade , " the stormy one " . A fierce and aged giant is IEgir , with long and foam-white beard , and black is his helmet . When he rises in the midst of Ocean , cold-hearted and turbulent , he shatters fair vessels in his wrath . Many ships has Angerboda , Hag of Ironwood , driven by her wild easterly winds into the very jaws of IEgir . In IEgir 's hall gold is used for fire , and his brewing kettles seethe and boil like stormy seas . His wife is  | Ran , the fair traitress . She is possessed of a great net , in which she catches seafarers when their ships are broken . So are men " drowned to Ran " . At the sea bottom is her home , which gleams phosphorescent and golden ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it unto the House of Death . Eager is Ran to make captives , and those who would win her favour must needs , when they are drawn down to her , take with them offerings of gold , for she loves treasure , and her hoard is great . To those whom she receives without anger she offers a seat and a bed . Nine giant maids are the chief daughters of Ran , and these are the mothers of Heimdal , the shining sentinel of beauteous Bif-rost . In gowns of blue they go forth . They have foam-white veils , and their locks are pale as sea froth . The sea maidens are ever at .1Egir 's command , and by him are they sent abroad to be ship-tossing billows . Great rocks they love to scatter and throw down , and the shoreland they devour . These giant maids at the beginning ground Ymer 's body on the World-mill . And ever do they turn the great mill at the sea bottom . Angeyja and Eyrgjafa grind mould ; Jarnsaxa is the crusher of the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gjalp , and Greip are fire maids , for from the World-mill is fire sparked forth , and there is fire in the sea ; Eistla , Eyrgjafa , and Ulfrun are also at work like the others . The sire of Gjalp and Greip was Geirrod , the fire-giant . Now when IEgir went to Asgard he was received by Odin and the other gods with pomp and in state . Together they drank mead , ancient and sweet , in spacious Valhal , which was adorned with burnished shields and made bright by shining swords . High sat the gods in their doom seats , and in full grandeur . By Bragi 's side  | was IEgir , and the sweet-voiced divine poet sang of Idun and her apples of immortal youth , and of Thjasse 's death , and of how Odin took from Suttung 's dwelling the skaldic-mead which Ivalde had stolen . Pleasant were the tales to IEgir , and the gods , as we have told , he besought to visit him in his Ocean kingdom . Thither at autumn equinox went Odin and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singing of skalds . But of mead there was not sufficient , because IEgir was in need of a brewing kettle large enough to give due hospitality to the gods . He besought Thor to fetch the greatest kettle in the nine worlds ; but nor Asa nor Vana-gods knew where it could be found until Tyr spake and said : " Hymer , the dog-headed , my foster-father , hath the great kettle , which is exceedingly strong and a mile in depth . His dwelling is beyond the Rivers Elivagar , nigh to the borders of Nifel-heim . " " Thinkest thou that the kettle can be captured ? " asked Thor . " Yes , " Tyr answered , " by stratagem it may be procured . " Then took Thor and Tyr the guise of young men , and they set forth in the thunder-god 's chariot drawn by the two goats Tanngnjoster and Tanngrisner over ocean and through air . Nearly all day did they travel thus until they came unto the dwelling of Orvandel-Egil . There did Thor leave the horn-strong goats and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast fishing ground of Hymer , whet-e he is wont to catch whales on great hooks . Then a great distance journeyed the gods on foot towards Hymer 's dwelling through dense mountain woods and past dismal rocky caverns where dwell the fierce giants and monsters of Hymer 's clan .  | When they came to their journey 's end , they entered the king giant 's great stronghold , and there Tyr saw his grandmother ? a giantess with numerous heads , who was fierce and awesome to behold . But his mother , who had great beauty , brought them mead to drink . When they were refreshed and strong again , she bade them hide behind a great post at the gable end , and beneath the Kettles of Hymer ; because , as she warned them , the giant was wont to give ill treatment to strangers who came nigh to his dwelling . At nightfall Thor and Tyr heard a mighty shout which was raised by the giant 's servants . Whereat Hymer entered , carrying , the whales he had caught . His long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou , indeed , 0 Hymer , " his wife said . " My son , for whom I have long waited , has come to thy hall , and with him is one who is an enemy of the giants and a friend of men . Behind yonder gable post have they with cunning concealed themselves . " Hymer was ill-pleased , and he turned fiercely towards the post , which suddenly went to pieces before his piercing gaze . Thereat the beam above it broke , and the Kettles fell down . Seven of them were thus broken , but one was so large and so strong that it was left whole , although it sank deep in the floor . Forth then came Tyr and Thor . The giant had no pleasure in receiving them , but he bade them be seated at his table . A great feast did he cause to be prepared . Three oxen were slain and roasted , and placed before the giant and the gods . Two of these did Thor eat , for he sought great strength . If the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal was ended , for it was his purpose to slay his guests , as was his wont , if they failed  | to eat an equal share with him ; but in this he was indeed thwarted . " Extravagant is our fare , " Hymer growled in his displeasure ; " on the morrow we must eat of fish . " Then to bed went they all , and sound was their sleep throughout the night . At dawn Thor rose , and from the window he perceived that the giant was making ready his boat to go fishing . Hastily did the Asa-god dress himself . He placed his great hammer in his belt . He went towards the shore , and then he besought the giant to allow him to row with him in the great boat . Hymer looked down upon him with contempt , and said : " Too small and frail art thou to be of help to me ; besides , I row so far and stay at sea so long , that thou wouldst be chilled to death . " Thor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast need of me , as far from land as is thy desire . Nor am I certain which of us twain would wish to return first . " The thunder-god was filled with wrath against the ice-giant because of his presumption , and was minded to strike him down with his hammer ; but he remembered that he had need of all his strength elsewhere , and must not do aught to lessen it . What bait hast thou for me ? " asked Thor . Hymer answered with surly voice : " If thou wouldst fish , find thine own bait . " That Thor did with impatience . He hastened towards the giant 's herd of great cattle , and seizing the largest bull , named Himinbrjoter , which signified " skycleaver " , he snatched off its head and carried it towards the shore . Hymer watched him and received him in silence , and together they entered the boat and put to sea .  | Both then seized the great billow-raising oars . At the bow rowed Hymer , and Thor was aft . So strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water with great swiftness , whereat the giant was amazed . Endeavour as he might , putting forth his utmost strength , Hymer could not pull with half the strength of the Asagod , who was still in youthful guise . The giant at length grew weary , and when they reached the grounds where he was wont to catch flat fish , he bade his companion cease rowing . But that Thor refused to do . " We have not yet , " he said , " gone far enough to sea . " Soon they came to the grounds where whales are caught , and again the giant bade Thor to take rest , but he would not consent to do so . " We must needs , " Thor said , " go much farther yet . Farther and farther out to sea they rowed with exceeding great speed . Then was the cold heart of Hymer filled with sharp alarm . " If we stop not now , " he cried , " we shall be in danger of the dread Midgard serpent . " But Thor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Not once nor twice did Hymer , resting wearily on his oars , remonstrate with him , but in vain . Far out to sea the boat still sped , and rapid and strong were the oarsweeps of Thor . Nor did he pause until they were a great distance from land . Then began the fishing . Hymer baited his hooks , and cast his line in the deep waters . Ere long he caught two great whales , and hauled them aboard . His eyes were bright with pleasure , and he turned towards Thor and challenged him to do as well .  | Then did the great thunder-god get ready his fishing tackle , which was of great strength . An immense hook he baited with the head of Hymer 's bull . Into the deep waters he flung his line , which , as it splashed , raised big billows , and he ran it out until the bait was dragged along the floor of the ocean . Now right below the giant 's boat lay the Midgard serpent , all slimy and horrible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail of its world-encircling body . When that great monster beheld the bait it was deceived , not perceiving that Thor 's hook was within . Greedily it seized the bull 's head and sought to devour it . Then did the great hook sink deep into its throat and stick there . Tortured was the serpent with terrible agony , and it began to writhe violently to be free ; but its struggle was without avail . So the line it tugged fiercely to draw angler and boat beneath the waves . But greater than the serpent 's was the strength of Thor . With both hands the god grasped the line , and against the side of the boat he placed his feet and began to pull , twisting the line round the oar pins as he did so , and now and again making it fast . Violently rocked the boat , and the waves rose high , as the great Midgard serpent struggled with the thunder-god . But Thor put forth his entire divine strength and he grew in stature as he pulled the line . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it tilted over , and they reached to the ocean floor . Harder and harder he pulled , and unwillingly the serpent , stung with fierce pain , was hauled through the deep , until its monstrous head came in sight . Awesome was the spectacle to Hymer , nor can words picture it . With fierce wrath did the thunder-god dart fiery looks at the serpent , while the great monster tossed  | on high its terrible head and spouted floods of venom upon him . Hymer trembled with fear ; his face was white as mountain snow . Scarce could he look upon the ferocious serpent , for ghastly it was , and bearded and venomspotted . Great waves washed over the gunwale , and the giant feared that the boat would be swamped . Still Thor struggled with the fierce monster until he dragged its head close to the edge of the boat . Then , twisting the line round the oar pin , he seized his great hammer and struck a mighty blow on the serpent 's head . The mountains shook with thunder , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole world shrank together , but the Midgard serpent was not yet killed . Thor prepared to strike another great blow , but Hymer in his fear cut the line , whereat the writhing monster sank back into the deep . The waves tossed high and the boat plunged with them . Angrily Thor turned upon Hymer , and with his great right fist struck him a resounding blow . Headlong plunged the giant into the sea , but speedily and in great fear he scrambled back again into the boat . Yet if his fear of the serpent was great , no less was his fear of Thor . Then set they to row back , and the boat went speedily . Thor spake not ; he sat in sullen silence . Deep indeed was his wrath because he had slain not the serpent which ever threatened the gods in Asgard . When the shore was reached the giant leapt out . Proudly he flung the two whales over his shoulder . But Thor carried the great boat , and went with it to the giant 's stronghold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyr  | beside them . Ill at ease was the giant because of Thor 's great deeds , and him did he challenge to perform another feat of strength . He brought forth a goblet , and asked him to break it . Without rising from his seat , Thor flung it violently against a post , which was shattered in pieces ; but the goblet remained whole , and it was brought back to the giant , who smiled well content . Then Tyr 's mother , whispering to Thor , bade him fling the goblet at Hymer 's forehead , which was harder than aught else there . Thor did that right speedily . He seized the goblet , and struck the giant with it midway between his eyes . Nor broken was the giant 's head , although the goblet fell shivered into small pieces on the table before him . " A great treasure have I lost , " Hymer cried . " Hot was the drink that came from my strong goblet . " The giant 's heart was filled with anger against Thor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged the Asa-god once again . " One feat of strength remains for thee yet to do , thou boastful one , " cried Hymer . " Seize yonder great kettle and carry it forth from my dwelling . " Tyr rose eagerly and ran to lift the kettle , which the gods waited for in IEgir 's hall ; but in vain did he try to lift it . Twice he made endeavour without avail . Then did Thor seize the kettle . He grasped it at the edge and shook it violently . Then he began to lift it . So heavy was it , and so great was the strength of Thor , that his feet went through the floor . Hymer watched him with angry eyes , fearing he would take with him the great treasure . That was what Thor did , for he lifted the kettle first upon his shoulder and then upon his head , while the rings fell round his feet . Then he darted outside , and Tyr went with him .  | Nor did they stay to await the giant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took also with him Hymer 's great boat . A great distance did the gods journey through the wooded mountain recesses , and then behind them there rose a great clamour . Hymer was hastening in pursuit . From the rocky caverns his foul and strange-headed clan were issuing forth , and following fast as well . They bellowed like winter tempests , and from hill to hill cliff their voices rang . Trees groaned and were bowed down , and the earth shook . Thor looked back , and when he beheld the host pursuing him he put down the boat and the kettle , and seized his hammer , Mjolner . That murderous weapon did he fling against the giants , and they were mowed down by it as oat straw is by a scythe . Not until he had slain all those who fled not did Thor swing high the boat and the kettle upon his shoulders , and with Tyr again pursue his way . Elivagar they could not have crossed in safety had they not had Hymer 's boat , for the waves ran high because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay wounded by hook and hammer on the rumbling floor of Ocean . In due time did Thor reach the hall of lEgir with the great kettle of Hymer . Then was brewed sufficient ale for the feast of harvest-end , and host and guests were made merry . But Thor rejoiced most because of the blow he had struck the great Midgard serpent . For thus was he avenged upon it for causing his shame in the dwelling of the giant Utgard-Loke , who had so cunningly deceived him . Of that , his most strange adventure , the tale must next be told .  | Thor 's Fishing On the dark bottom of the great salt lake Imprisoned lay the giant snake , With naught his sullen sleep to break .

THE Frost-giants were sending forth from Jotun-heim ice-cold blasts which blighted Midgard 's fields and arrested all growth . Thor , the friend of man , was made wroth thereat , and he caused his swift goats to be yoked to his sublime chariot , for he was resolved to punish the Jotuns for their presumption and evil workings . To him came Loke and made flattering address , praising the thunder-god for his valour and good intentions . Thor took Loke with him because he had knowledge of the northern wastes they must needs traverse . All day they journeyed from Asgard , and at nightfall they came to the dwelling of Orvandel-Egil on the banks of Elivagar , and fronting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set before them was meagre because of the plunder accomplished by the giants , so Thor slew his two goats , and when they were skinned he placed their flesh in a kettle . The feast that was thus prepared was abundant , and  | Thor invited Orvandel and his family to eat with Loke and himself , requesting them to throw each flesh-stripped bone into the skins of the goats . It was Loke 's desire to stir up enmity between Thor and Orvandel , who were fast friends , because at the house of the skilful archer did the thunder-god ever rest on his journeyings to and from Jotun-heim . The Evil One made Orvandel 's son , Thjalfe , the instrument of his designs . To him Loke whispered at the feast that the marrow of the bones was of exceeding sweetness , and he constrained upon the lad to break open the thigh bone of a goat 's hind leg . Next morning Thor arose and took his hammer , Mjolner , which he waved over the skins filled with loose bones . Then did the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hind leg was broken . Thor was moved to immense wrath , and with black brows , and with knuckles that grew white as he clutched the handle of his hammer , he turned upon Orvandel , who was stricken with much fear . The house shook because of Thor 's anger . But the evil designs of Loke were put to naught , for Thor consented to take for ransomservants , Orvandel 's son , Thjalfe , the swift runner , and his beauteous daughter , Roskva , the vivacious , and his love for them made stronger the bond of friendship between the thunder-god and Orvandel . Leaving his chariot and goats behind , Thor went on his journey with Loke and Thjalfe and Roskva . Soon they came to a great mountain forest , and through its immense depths they wandered until night came on . Fleet-footed Thjalfe carried Thor 's meat sack , but it was wellnigh empty because it was difficult to hunt the deer in that confusing forest . In the darkness they all sought a dwelling in which  | to rest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , for it opened up the whole side of the house . Within there was a vast hall . Beyond were five long rooms like to mountain caves ; but they entered them not . In the outer hall they prepared their couches and lay down to sleep . In the middle of the night a great earthquake made the forest tremble , so that the house shook with much violence . Then Thor arose and sought for his affrighted servants a place of greater safety . So they entered together the widest of the cave chambers in the vast house . Thor stood at the door on guard , with his great hammer in his hand , ready to strike down any fierce giant who would dare to enter . The others crept to the farthest end of the chamber , and , trembling greatly , again sought their couches . Then was heard a rumbling and a roaring that continued long and then ceased awhile , but began again . It was a night of blackness and great terror . At early dawn Thor went forth , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest and found that a great giant lay sleeping on the ground . He snored as loudly as roars the outer sea , and his breath burst forth like wild gusts of tempest . Then did the Asa-gods realize from whence came the clamour which had filled the night with terror . Around his waist Thor tightened his magic belt so that his great strength was increased , but as he grasped his hammer to strike , the mighty giant awoke , and rose hastily to his feet . High above Thor he towered , so that the thunder-god was filled with amaze at his great bulk and forgot to wield his hammer . " What is thy name , 0 giant ? " Thor asked .  | " My name is Skrymer , " was his answer , and he said : " Thine I need not ask , for I perceive thou art Asa-Thor . " Then the giant looked about him , and sneered : " But what hast thou done with my glove ? " Skrymer stretched forth his hand , and in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then with amazement did Thor perceive that it was the great dwelling in which , with his companions , he had found shelter for the night . The broad cave chamber into which they had crept was the thumb of the giant 's glove . Skrymer besought Thor to take him for his travelling companion through that vast country , and when the Asa-god gave his consent , the giant opened his meat sack and began to munch his morning feast . Thor and his companions did likewise in a place apart . Now when they had finished their meals and were satisfied , Skrymer said they should put their food together . Thor was willing that such should be done , and the giant thrust all the provisions into his own meat sack , which he threw over his back . All day long they travelled eastward with great speed , because of the rapid pace of the giant , and when darkness began to fall they rested under the branches of a vast and lofty oak tree . Skrymer said he was weary and must needs sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bade him feast with his companions . But Thor found that the sack was bound so securely that he could not untie it . Each knot defied him ; not one could he unloose ; and struggle as he might , he was unable to slacken any portion of the cord . Great wrath possessed the Asa-god because of the deceit which had been practised upon him ; so , casting  | the sack from him , he sprang up and seized his hammer . He went swiftly towards the giant as he lay snoring heavily , and on his skull struck a mighty blow . Skrymer awoke , and , rubbing his eyes , asked if a leaf had fallen down from the great oak . On Thor he gazed , and asked him if he had eaten his supper , and was ready for sleep . Thor made answer gruffly that he was about to lie down , and went towards another tree . But there he found that it was not possible to get sleep , for Skrymer snored so loudly that the woods were shaken with tempest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant he swung his great hammer and struck him flat on the forehead . So great was the blow that Mjolner sank down to the heft . Skrymer awoke suddenly and growled : " What hath happened now to disturb my slumber ? Did an acorn fall down from the branches ? Is that thee , Thor , standing nigh me ? How fares it with thee ? " " I have just awakened , " was Thor 's answer , as he turned , wondering greatly , and again lay down beneath his oak . But he sought not to sleep . He was resolved to be avenged on the giant for his deceit , and because his own rest was broken . As Thor lay there he was convinced that if he dealt but one more blow on the giant 's skull he would kill him . So he remained watching and waiting until Skrymer would again fall to sleep . Ere dawn broke his opportunity came , for the giant 's loud snoring once more made fearsome clamour in the forest . Thor arose and tightened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and seized his mighty hammer . Then he went towards the giant and  | struck so great a blow that Mjolner was buried in one of his temples . Skrymer sat up , rubbing his eyes . Then he stroked his chin in vacant wonder , and , seeing Thor beside him , said : " Do birds sit above me in the oak branches ? Methinks that some moss from a bird 's nest fell upon my forehead as I awoke . . . . So thou art also awake , O Thor . . . . The dawn has broken , and it is time to set forth upon your way , for a long journey lies before thee ere thou shalt reach the castle which is called Utgard ( outer-ward ) . Whispers I have heard between thee and thy companions that ye regard me as one of no mean stature , but larger men shalt thou find when thou dost reach Utgard . . . . Wilt thou take from me good advice ? When thou comest to Utgard , do not boast overmuch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from such insignificant beings as are thou and thy companions . . . . If my advice is not pleasant to thee , 0 Thor , thou hadst better turn back ; and , indeed , that is what thou shouldst do . . . . But if thou wouldst go farther , thy way lies eastward ; mine is to the north , towards yonder high mountains . Fare thee well ! " When he had spoken thus , Skrymer flung his meat sack over his shoulder and vanished amidst the trees . Nor was it ever known whether or not Thor desired to meet with him again . Thor and Loke went eastward upon their way , and with them went Thjalfe and Roskva . They journeyed until midday , when they came to a city in the midst of which was a great ice castle . So lofty were its towers that Thor and those with him had need to bend back their heads to survey it aright . They saw no one nigh to the castle , and its ponderous gate was shut and  | securely locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but being anxious to gain admittance he crept between the bars . The others followed him . They then perceived that the palace door was wide open , and they entered together . Round the hall many giants of immense stature were seated upon benches . No word was spoken nor greeting given , but Thor and his companions went past , and entering a wide room they stood before King UtgardLoke in his high throne , and to him they made obeisance . A cold look gave the monarch , nor did he return their salutations . After a long pause he spake with a voice of keen scorn , saying : " It would be wearisome to have tidings of your long journey . If I be not mistaken the greatest of the striplings who stand before me is the Asa-god Thor . " Upon Thor he gazed intently , and then addressing him , said : " It may be that thou art stronger than thou dost seem . What feats art thou able to perform ? Thou must know that no one can remain here who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings . " Wroth was Thor and made no answer . But Loke spoke and said : " I know a great feat , and am ready to perform it . I can eat quicker than anyone else , and I am now an-hungered and ready to give proof of that against him who may be chosen to contend with me . " " If thou shalt do as thou sayest , " Utgard-Loke said , " thou shalt perform a great feat indeed . Let us have trial of it without delay . " The king ordered Loge , one of his men , to come forward to compete with Asa-Loke . A great trough of meat was prepared , and the two were seated ? Loke at one end and Loge at the other .  | Then they began to eat with great speed , nor did they falter until they met at the middle . To neither seemed the victory , until it was found that Loge had consumed the bones as well as the flesh , and the trough also , while Loke had eaten but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then addressed Thjalfe , and asked him what feat he was able to perform , and the young man answered that he was a swift runner . He offered to run a race with anyone whom the monarch would select . " If thou dost win , " Utgard-Loke said , " thou shalt indeed perform a wondrous feat . But come without , for thine opponent awaiteth thee . " The king left his throne , and together they all went to a fine racecourse that lay nigh to the castle walls . A dwarf named Huge was called forth by UtgardLoke . Thrice did he run with Thjalfe . At the first contest the dwarf ran so fast that he met the other as he turned back . " Thou canst run well , " the king said to Thjalfe , " but thou must needs be more nimble-legged if thou art to win this contest , for there is no swifter runner than Huge . " At the second trial Thjalfe went speedier , but he was a bowshot space behind the dwarf when that swift runner made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if thou wouldst win the race , " said the king to Orvandel 's son ; " but another chance awaiteth thee . The third trial shall decide the contest . " Again the race was started ; but if Thjalfe went swiftly there was more speed in the dwarf , for he reached the goal ere yet his opponent was halfway . So was Thjalfe vanquished and put to shame .  | Together they all returned to the hall , and the king , turning to Thor , asked him if he could perform any wonderful feats that day . The Asa-god made prompt answer and said : " I shall hold a drinking contest with anyone thou mayest select . " " First , " said the king , " thy power must be tested . " To this condition Thor gave his ready consent . Then came a cupbearer carrying an immense drinking horn , which he gave unto the Asa-god . " He who trespasseth the laws of this place when at feast , " the king said , " must needs drink from that horn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a single draught . Some men , however , must make two attempts , but it is only the weakest who can not exhaust it at the third trial . " Now Thor was tortured with exceeding great thirst after his long journey , and at first he deemed the horn not to be too large , although it had great length indeed . To his mouth he raised it , and drank deep , until his thirst was quenched ; and he continued drinking until he was forced to cease and lower the horn . With great wonder he then perceived that the liquor seemed not to have diminished at all . " Thou hast drunken well , " the king said , " yet there is naught of which boast can be made . Had I been told that Thor would drink no more when in thirst I would not have believed it . But perhaps it is thy resolve to surpass thyself when thou shalt take the second draught . " Again did the Asa-god raise the horn with firm resolve to empty it . Ill-pleased was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before . But that was not so , for when he had done his utmost the horn could be carried without spilling . " Thou dost spare thyself indeed , " the king exclaimed ;  | " but if thou art resolved to empty the horn thou must pull with greater strength at thy third trial . If more skill at this feat is not shown by thee , methinks , " the king added with scorn , " thou shalt be accounted a lesser man here than thou seemest to be among the gods in Asgard . " Angry was Thor because of the words which UtgardLoke spake , and a third time he seized the horn and put forth all his power to empty it ; but long and deep as he drank , be seemed not to exhaust it any . He laid it down , and then he perceived that the liquor was slightly lower than before . " No further trial shall I make , " he said , as he thrust the horn back to the cupbearer . Ha ! thou'rt of less strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling grimly at the thwarted Asa-god . " Yet , mayhap , thou wouldst try another feat to prove thy power , although I am assured that thou shalt have no better success . " But Thor was ready for any other trial . " I shall contend with whom thou wilt , " he said . " Although I have failed with the horn , yet can I assure thee that the draughts which I have taken would not be counted meagre in Asgard . " " There is a trivial game which we play betimes , " the king said , " but I would not have asked thee to perform it , because among us here it is only an exercise for children . Yet as thou art , it seems , not of so great power as we deemed heretofore , thou hadst better try it . The game is merely to lift my cat from the floor . " As he spake , a big grey cat leapt forward and sat before the throne . Thor at once went towards it , and grasped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attempted to lift the cat , but it bent its great  | back , and although he put forth all his strength Thor could lift but one paw from the floor . Knowing well that he could not do better , he made no further attempt . " Thou hast failed , as I foresaw thou wouldst , " the king said . " The cat is too large for Thor , who is weakly and small compared with the men of my race . " " Say what thou wilt , " cried Thor , whose wrath was great because of the shame put upon him , " but I now challenge anyone here to wrestle with me whom ye call weakly and small . " Utgard-Loke looked calmly about him , and answered with chilling voice : " I see no one nigh me who would not deem it an unworthy thing to wrestle with Thor . . . . But let the old woman , my nurse , whose name is Elle , be called , and if Thor would perforce wrestle , let him try his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath Elle thrown down . " Then came into the hall an aged woman , who was toothless and heavily wrinkled . Her back was bent , and she walked slowly . Utgard-Loke bade her wrestle with Thor . There is little to tell . The firmer Thor clutched her the mightier she became ; the stronger his grip , the more securely did she stand . The struggle was long and violent , and although Thor realized ere long that he could not overcome the Hag , his endeavour was to prevent her from casting him down . Yet was he at length unable to keep his footing , and he was brought to his knee . Then did Utgard-Loke bid the wrestlers to cease , and walking forward he placed himself between them . To Thor he said : " Thou canst not ask now to wrestle with  | anyone else in the hall , for the hour is late and darkness is falling . " Nor did he seem to be eager that Thor should have further trial of skill . At dawn of next day Thor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle . Food and drink in plenty were placed before them , and they made hearty feast . Then went they to take leave of the king , and Utgard-Loke walked with them until they were without the gate of the city . Ere they bade one another farewell , the king asked Thor if he was satisfied with his journey and the results thereof , and whether there were any others among the Asa-gods who were stronger than he . " I can not deny , " Thor said , " that great shame has been put upon me . But what pains me most is that thou shouldst call me a man of little account . " " Be not mistaken , " the king said , " for we hold thee in greater account than thou dost deem . Now must the truth be told , seeing thou art no longer in the city which , if my will shall prevail , thou must never enter again . This I swear : if I had known that thy strength was so mighty thou shouldst never have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , didst thou bring me unto a great disaster . " Thou mayest now know , " the king continued , " that I have all along deceived thee greatly with my illusions . " Thor stared with much amaze at Utgard-Loke , who spake thus : " First , it was I whom thou didst meet with in the forest . My meat sack thou couldst not unloose because I had bound it securely with a rope of iron , and thou couldst not discover how the cunning knots were devised . " Thrice thou didst strike me with thy great hammer .  | From any of these blows of thine I would have received speedy death , but thee I deceived by creating an illusion and placing betwixt thee and me a great rocky mountain , which thou didst cleave with thy blows . On thy way back thou shalt see it , and the three broad valleys thou didst make , for thrice thou didst cut it asunder . " In my palace I did also deceive thee with illusions . Asa-Loke , like hunger , devoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent Loge , who is Fire , consumed not only the food , but the bones also , and the trough . " Huge the dwarf , with whom Thjalfe ran , is Thought . Swift indeed must the runner be who is more speedy than Thought . " Then came thine own feats , 0 mighty Thor . When thou didst attempt to drain the horn , thou didst perform a feat so wonderful , that if I had not beheld it with mine own eyes I should ne'er have believed it to be possible . For the horn was long , and one end reached out to the sea , which thou didst not perceive , and the sea filled it . When thou dost come to the shore thou shalt realize how much thou hast made the sea to shrink , for thy great draughts have caused what men shall henceforward call the ebb . " No less marvellous was thy struggle with the great cat . Much fear possessed us when we saw thee lift but a single paw from the floor , because the cat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . So high didst thou lift him that his head reached unto heaven . " Great indeed was thy feat also when thou didst contend against the old woman , my nurse . No man ever before prevailed so wrestling , nor shall any man ever again do as thou hast done , for Elie is Old Age ,  | and sooner or later she lays low all who await her coming . Still was Thor silent , for he was filled with great wonder by reason of the things of which Utgard-Loke spake to him . " Now , 0 Thor , " the king said , " we are about to part . This must I say unto you . It were better that we two should never again meet ; but if thou shouldst come against me any more I must needs defend myself with illusions as I have already done , so that thou shalt never seem to thyself to prevail . " When the king spake thus he vanished from before the eyes of Thor and his companions . Then was the thunder-god moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizing his mighty hammer he turned towards the city again to wreak his vengeance upon Utgard-Loke and his people . But he found that city and castle had vanished , and he beheld nothing save a broad level plain . So with his companions Thor then went gloomily on his way , and pondering over what had happened he resolved to combat with the Midgard serpent from Hymer 's boat . And of this adventure the tale has been told , but of how Thor lost his great hammer and the strange adventure that ensued , the story follows .  | Thor in Peril The Theft of Mjolner ? Loke 's Mission ? Thrym demands Freyja ? The Wrath of the Goddess ? Thor disguised ? Giant Bridegroom 's Amaze ? A Hungry Bride ? The Hammer recovered ? Vengeance of Thor ? Loke in Geirrod 's Castle ? Plot to capture Thor ? Grid intervenes ? Vidar the Silent ? Crossing Elivagar ? The High Flood ? Giant Maid is punished ? Geirrod 's Flaming Javelin ? Thunder-god 's Victory Now there was a king of giants whose name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauteous Asa-goddess , for his bride . A deep plot he laid , nor did the gods become aware of it until a grievous misfortune befell Thor . He was returning with Loke from Jotun-heim , and together they lay down to sleep . In great wrath was the thunder-god when he awoke because he could find not his hammer , Mjolner . He grasped his red beard and shook it , and fear crept over him as he searched around and about , because without his hammer he was powerless to contend against the giants . When the other awoke , Thor spoke to him , saying : " Listen to me , and I shall tell thee what is known not in heaven nor upon earth ? Mjolner is stolen ! " Speedily they took flight towards high Asgard , and to the dwelling of Freyja went they . Thor spake abruptly , and said : " Wilt thou lend thy falcon-guise to me , for my hammer hath been stolen , and I would fain find it . " " Gladly shall I give it thee , 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were made of silver ; yea , if it were of fine gold thou wouldst have it without delay . " To Loke gave Thor the falcon-guise , and he flew speedily from Asgard to the northern coasts of distant Jotun-heim . Nor did he pause or stay until he reached a high mountain on which sat Thrym , king of giants , twisting bands of gold for his dogs , and anon smoothing the gold mane of his horse . When he beheld Loke in falcon-guise he said : " How fare the gods , and how fare the elves ? Why dost thou come alone unto these shores ? " Loke answered : " Ill fares it with gods and ill fares it with the elves . Hast thou hidden the hammer of Thor ? " Thrym answered boldly and with gladness : " I have indeed done so . Nine miles below the ground have I buried Mjolner . Nor shall it ever be recovered or returned unto Thor until I am given the goddess Freyja for my bride . " Having spoken thus he smoothed leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew back towards Asgard . Thor awaited him on the battlements , and when the falcon drew nigh he cried : " Hast thou indeed performed thy mission , 0 Loke ? Tell me what thou knowest ere thou dost descend . What is spoken by one who sits is often of small worth . He who reclines is prone to utter what is untrue . " Loke answered and said : " I have discovered all that needs be known . Thy hammer hath been stolen by Thrym , King of Jotuns , and he bath buried it nine miles down below the mountains . Nor will he deliver it to thee again until Freyja is given him to be his bride . "  | Then Thor and Loke went unto Freyja and told her what the giant had said . Impatient , indeed , was the thunder-god , for he feared that if it became known to the Frost-giants that his hammer was lost they would fall upon Asgard and overcome the gods . " Right speedily thou must don thy bridal attire , O Freyja , " Thor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Freyja was filled with anger , and as she raged she broke her flashing necklace that gave her great beauty . " A love-sick maid , indeed , I would be , " she exclaimed , " ere I would hasten to King Thrym . " To the high Thingstead of Asgard went Thor , and the gods assembled there to hold counsel one with another and decide how the hammer should be recovered . To the hall Vingolf went the goddesses , to consult regarding the fate of Freyja . In the Thingstead , Heimdal , the wise Van , the shining god , spake with foreknowledge and cunning , and thus he advised : " Let Thor be dressed in the bridal robes of Freyja , and let him also don her sparkling necklace , which gives its wearer great beauty . In a woman 's dress let Thor go forth , with keys jingling at his waist . His hair must be pleated , and on his breast must be fixed great brooches . " But Thor made protest , and declared that the gods would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ill-pleased was he with Heimdal 's words . " Be silent , Thor , " Loke exclaimed ; " thou knowest well that if thy hammer is found not the Frost-giants will come speedily hither and build over Asgard a dome of ice . " The other gods spake likewise , and Thor consented to be attired as a bride . When this was done , Loke was dressed , at his own desire , as a maid attendant , and  | together they went forth from Asgard in Thor 's sublime car . The mountains thundered and fire swept from the heavens over Midgard as Thor journeyed to Jotun-heim . Thrym was sitting on the mountain top , and to the Jotuns about him he spoke , when he beheld Thor in female-guise coming nigh , saying : " Arise , 0 giants ! let the feast be spread , for Freyja comes hither to be my bride . " Then were driven before him into his yard his red cows with golden horns , and his great black oxen . " 1 have great wealth indeed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I lack naught save Freyja . " The feast was made ready , and at the board sat Thor , whom Thrym deemed to be Freyja , and Loke , who was " maid attendant " . Thor had great hunger , and he ate an ox , eight salmon , and all the sweets which had been made ready for the giantesses . Then he drank three great barrels of ancient mead . Wondering , Thrym sat and watched him . Then he cried : " Hath anyone ever beheld a bride so hungry ? Never have I known a maid who ate as Freyja hath eaten , or a woman who ever drank so great a quantity of mead . " Loke , the cunning one , fearing that Thor would be discovered , said : " For eight days hath Freyja fasted , so greatly did she long to come unto Jotun-heim . " Thrym was well pleased to hear what Loke said , and he rose and went towards Thor . He lifted the veil he wore and sought to kiss , but he shrank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he cried : " Why are the eyes of Freyja so bright and so fierce ? They seem to glow like hot embers . " Then spake cunning Loke again , and said : " Alas !  | 0 Thrym , for eight nights Freyja hath slept not , for she longed to be here with thee in Jotun-heim . Thus are her eyes a-fire . " Thrym 's sister then entered , and she went towards Thor humbly and with due respect , and asked to be given golden bridal rings from his fingers . " Thou shalt gift them to me , " she said , " if thou desirest to have my friendship and my love . " But naught did she receive from the angry and impatient god of thunder . Thrym then desired that the wedding ceremony should be held , but Loke asked that as proof of his friendship , and to complete the bargain the giant had made , Thor 's hammer should be laid upon the maiden 's lap . Then did Thrym order that Mjolner be lifted from its hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor 's heart there was great laughter when Thrym spoke thus , yet was his mind solemn , and he waited anxiously until Mjolner was laid upon his knees . A servant came forward with it , and Thor clutched the handle right eagerly . Then he tore off the bridal veil from his face and the woman 's dress from about his knees , and sprang upon King Thrym , whom he killed with a single blow . Around the feasting board he went , slaying the guests , nor one would he permit to escape from the hall , so fierce was he with long-restrained wrath . Thrym 's sister , who had begged from Thor the bridal rings , he slew with the others . A blow she received from the hammer instead of golden treasure . Cunning Loke watched with pleasure the devastation accomplished by the fierce thunder-god as he raged round the hall and through the castle , wreaking his fierce vengeance on the whole clan of Thrym.  | Then together hastened they to where the goats were bound at the home of Orvandel , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedily driven the black sublime car . Swiftly o'er mountain and sea it went , blotting out the sparkling stars . Mountains thundered and the wide ocean trembled with fear as the car rolled on . The earth was filled with fire . Thus did Thor return in triumph unto Asgard , because Mjolner was recovered and the King of Mountain Giants was slain . But although Loke had served Thor well when his hammer was stolen by Thrym , there came a time when he brought the god of thunder nigh to great misfortune . It was in the days ere the winter war was waged between the Asa-gods and the sons of Ivalde , and the cunning artisans were yet friendly with the dwellers in Asgard . Loke had gone forth in the falcon-guise of Freyja to pry round Jotun-heim , and especially the castle of King Geirrod , whose daughter he desired for a bride . He flew towards a window , and sat in it while he listened to the words that were being spoken , and surveyed the guests who were there . A servant beheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a real falcon . So , making cautious approach , he seized Loke and brought him before the king . The eyes of the falcon were still the cunning eyes of Loke , and he was recognized by Geirrod , who demanded ransom ere he would release him . In vain did Loke endeavour to escape . He flapped his wings , he pecked with his beak , but the servant held his claws securely . Silent was he before Geirrod , and no answer would he make when he was addressed . So to punish him the giant locked him in a chest , in which he was kept for three months . Then was Loke taken forth , and ready  | indeed was he to speak . To Geirrod he confessed who he was , and the giant constrained him to promise , by swearing a binding oath , that he would bring Thor to Jotun-heim and unto that strong castle without his hammer or his belt or his iron gloves . For greatly sought the giant to have the thunder-god in his power . Loke then flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thor , so that he secured his consent to visit the castle of Geirrod without taking with him his hammer and gloves and his strong belt . For Loke assured Thor that the castle stood on a green and level plain , and that they were invited to attend together a feast of friends . Thor set forth , and Loke went with him . All day they travelled on their way until they came to the borders of Elivagar in Alf-heim , where dwelt the sons of Ivalde . There dwelt also in that realm and in the midst of a deep wood a giantess who was friendly towards the gods . Her name was Grid . She was the mother of Odin 's son Vidar , the Silent One , whose strength was so mighty that none save Thor was his equal . A great shoe he had ; its sole was hard as iron , for it was formed of the cast-off leather scraps of every shoe that was ever made . This son of Grid was born to avenge his father 's death . When Odin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf Fenrer and tear its jaws asunder . Nor shall Surtur destroy him with his firebrands , for the wood-god perishes never in Nature 's deep solitudes . Now Grid , mother of Vidar , had power to work magic spells , and she possessed a magic rowan wand which was named Gridarvold . When she beheld Thor going unarmed towards Geirrod 's castle , she warned him  | that the giant was as cunning and treacherous as a wolfdog , and dangerous to meet without weapons . So to Thor she gave her magic staff , her belt of strength , and her iron gloves , and when he set out he took with him the sons of Ivalde . Together they travelled in safety until they came to Vimur , which is the greatest of the rivers Elivagar . The clouds drove heavily above them , and hailstones fell around . Wild and mountainous was the country which Loke had said was green and level . There were swift and treacherous eddies in the swollen waters . But Thor put on the belt of strength which Grid had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . Rapidly did the river rise as he entered it with his men . From the mountains icy torrents poured down with increasing strength , and the sons of Ivalde were soon in great peril . They thrust their spears into the shingle as they tried to ford the river , and the clinking of the steel mingled with the sharp screams of the waters . When they were but halfway across a high wave burst out from a great mountain torrent , and the waters rose to Thor 's shoulder . The others were swept down towards him ; for , perceiving their peril and desiring to be a protection to them , he had chosen the deepest part through which to wade . Orvandel leapt upon Thor 's shoulder , and there stood , bending his bow . Loke and the others clung to the belt of Grid , which was about Thor 's body . Towards the bank the thunder-god laboured , and when he came nigh to it he beheld at the torrent 's source a daughter of Geirrod , whose name was Gjalp . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the river to increase so that Thor and his followers might be drowned . The angry god seized a boulder and flung it towards her . Sure was his aim , for it struck her heavily , so that  | her back was broken . Thus was the Hag overcome and the torrent stayed . Then did Thor seize a rowan-tree branch which overhung the river , and with its aid he pulled himself up the bank . Thus had its origin the ancient proverb : " f Thor 's salvation , the rowan " . Up the steep mountain did the thunder-god climb with all his men . Against them came the giants who sought to destroy Ygdrasil , " the World-tree " . Bravely fought Thor , and the arrows of Orvandel sped fast until the horde of giants were put to flight . Speedily did the heroes follow them . They pressed onward and reached Geirrod 's castle amidst the clamour and the howling of the storm-giants and the giants that dwell within the caves of the mountains . When Thor entered Geirrod 's hall the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great pillar of wood . But with Grid 's iron gloves Thor caught it , and past Orvandel 's head he flung it back , so that it went through the pillar and through Geirrod , who was slain ; and it passed through the wall of his castle ere it sank deep into the earth . Then loudly thundered the din of battle in Geirrod 's hall , which was shaken to its foundations . With slings and boulders did the giants contend , but from Thor and his men they received their deathblows . Thus was Geirrod and his clan overcome in dread conflict ; but no less terrible was the battle which Thor waged against Hrungner , the stone-giant , the tale of which now follows .  | Thor I am the god Thor , I am the war god , I am the Thunderer !

THOR was in the east battling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling of Hrungner , the great stone giant of Jotun-heim . Hrungner watched him coming through the air in splendour and beauty , and he cried : " Who cometh towards me ? On his head is a helmet of gleaming gold . He rides over ocean and high upon the air . Swift indeed is his mighty steed . " Ere the giant was silent the ruler of Asgard was nigh to him , and he spake proudly . " In all Jotun-heim , " Odin said , " there is not a horse that is Sleipner 's equal . " Then twitching the reins , he turned Sleipner back towards Asgard , and he rode swifter than the wind . " Thy steed is fast indeed , " the giant bellowed , " but my nimble - footed Goldfax ( gold mane ) hath greater stride . " As he spake , Hrungner leapt upon his horse 's back and set out in swift pursuit of the Asa-god . But although he urged Goldfax to hasten , he could not win nigh unto Odin . Yet would the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was afire with ambition to prevail over the rider of Sleipner . Swiftly indeed he rode , and ere he was aware he found himself entering the gates of Asgard over the gate-bridge which had been set down for Odin . By the gods was he received with hospitality as he demanded . They took him to the great feasting hall , and there he drank ancient mead and sweet . The bowls from which Thor was wont to refresh himself were placed before him , and Freyja filled them . Each of the bowls the giant emptied in turn at a single draught . Indeed , so much did he drink that the mead surged in his veins and his eyes rolled with redness , for he was made drunk . Then was his tongue unloosened , and he gave forth loud boastings . " Valhal , " he cried , " shall be mine . . . . The warrior 's hall must I carry away with me to Jotun-heim . " More mead did Freyja pour out to him , filling the bowls of Thor . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cast down its wall and palaces . . . . " The gods , " he cried , " and all that are within the city shall I slay save Freyja and Sif . " As Freyja filled the bowls he said : " Ha ! all the mead in Asgard I must consume this day . None shall I leave for the gods . " Weary grew the gods of the braggart giant and his vain boastings , and Thor they named . . . . Immediately Thor was in their midst . Black were the brows of the thunder-god when he beheld Hrungner ; white were his knuckles as he clutched his great hammer . " Who hath permitted this Jotun , " Thor roared , " to drink the mead of Asgard ? Why doth Freyja pour it forth to him as if she were honouring a feast of gods ? "  | Evil was in Hrungner 's eyes as he scowled at Thor . " By Odin 's wish am I here , " he sneered , " and under his protection I remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thor growled sullenly , " thou mayest regret the invitation . " " Unarmed have I come , " Hrungner protested with sudden alarm , " and of little honour would it be to thee , O Asa-Thor , if thou didst slay me now . If thou wouldst fain put thy valour to proof , thee I dare to contend against me on the borders of my kingdom . " Thor cast at him defiant eyes , and the giant was troubled . " Alas ! " he cried ; " I have done foolishly to come hither , leaving my stone shield and my flint weapon in Jotun-heim . Were I armed , we might well fight . This shall I say unto thee , 0 Asa-Thor : I would brand thee as a coward if thou didst seek to slay me undefended . . . . I challenge thee to contend with me in an island duel . " Now never before had Thor been challenged thus . For the island duel ( Holmgang ) which Hrungner desired was fought by dealing blow for blow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was challenged by the other . In the contest each would have a shieldbearer . His consent did Thor give to the giant 's terms , and in silence they parted . Through Jotun-heim the duel challenge was gravely debated by the giants , and keen was their desire that Thor should be worsted , because Hrungner was their strongest and greatest warrior , and they feared that if he fell the thunder-god would do them more injury than heretofore . On an island on the borders of rocky Grjottungard. where Hrungner had his dwelling , the Jotuns made a giant of clay who was in height nine miles , and three  | in breadth between the shoulders . Him they called Mokker-kalfi ( Mist-wader ) , and they gave him a mare 's heart . He was shieldbearer to Thor 's enemy . Now Hrungner had a heart of stone ; his head was of stone also . Broad and thick was his stone shield , and in his right hand he grasped his great flint weapon , which he swung over his shoulder . A terrible combatant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His shieldbearer was his faithful Thjalfe , son of Orvandel , who ran swiftly to the place of combat . To Hrungner he cried : " Although thy shield is held in front , thou dost stand unprotected , for Thor cometh to attack thee from the earth beneath . " Then did Hrungner cause his shield to be cast down . Defiantly he stood upon it , while with both hands he grasped his great flint weapon . In fear and trembling was Mokker-kalfi . His mare 's heart quaked within him because Thor was coming , and sweat ran from his body in torrents . Thunder broke forth and lightning flashed before Hrungner . Then he beheld rushing swiftly towards him the black-browed thunder-god , who swung his hammer to strike . Nor did Hrungner wait till he was nigh . He raised his great flint weapon and flung it with might against Mjolner , which Thor , divining his purpose , hurtled simultaneously . In mid-air the weapons met and flashed forking fire that rent the heavens and covered the ocean with flame . The flint was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there to this day are the flint hills , and a great splinter pierced the forehead of the Asa-god , so that he was thrown down . Meanwhile the sublime hammer smote Hrungner and crushed his skull , and he fell also . The giant 's foot  | struck Thor and lay heavily upon his neck , so that he could not rise to his feet . On the affrighted Mokker-kalfi had Thjalfe flung himself , and him he overcame right speedily . Then ran he to help Thor , but in vain he strove to lift Hrungner 's foot from his neck . . . . He named the Asa-gods , and they hastened from Asgard to the place of combat . When they found that Thor was cast down , they put forth their strength to free him , but unable were they to lift the giant 's foot . Then came Thor 's son , Magni , whose mother was Jarnsaxa , the iron-crusher of the World-mill . He was but three nights old , but had already exceeding great strength . The giant 's foot he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " Alas ! I should have come sooner . Hrungner 's head would I have broken with my fist ! " Thor leapt up , and his arms he threw about his son , embracing him with great love . " To thee , 0 Magni , " he said , " I shall give Goldfax , Hrungner 's great steed But Odin was ill-pleased with Thor , and to him he said : " Thou halt done wrong to give unto a Hag 's son the speedy horse of the giant . ' T were better if thou hadst gifted it to thy sire . " in wrath he turned away with the gods of his clan , and went towards Asgard . Now the day of the great island duel was long ere the time when the sons of Ivalde waged the winter war against the Asa-gods . As Thor returned towards Orvandel 's dwelling , his resting place on the borders of Jotun-heim , where he was wont to leave his swift , strong goats and his sublime car , he met with Orvandel , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth to fight  | against the Frost-giants , but with ill success as it proved , for they pressed nigh to him and sought to take him captive . Thor rescued his friend speedily , and placed him in the meat basket , which he carried on his shoulders , as he waded through deep Elivagar . Orvandel thrust a toe through a hole , and a spell was put upon it by the giants , so that it was frozen . Then did Thor snap it off and fling it high in the heavens , where it became a bright star , which unto this day is called " Orvandel 's Toe " . Thus it was that the elfin archer ( Avo ) became a star hero . When he parted with Orvandel , Thor yoked his goats , and in his sublime car he hastened towards his dwelling in Thrud - Varg . In grievous pain was he because of the wound which Hrungner had given him . Deep in his forehead was the flint flake embedded . In vain did Sith seek to alleviate his sufferings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thor 's stronghold , as was her wont when her husband went forth against the Frost-giants . She had the power to work magic spells . She who was the " elf of growth " could make rocks to move , and she had power to arrest the turbulent floods . It was Groa who restored to strength those whom the Frost-giants had wounded , and it was she who gave beauty again to the places which they laid waste . Unto Thor she came to heal his wound , and take from his forehead the splintered flint which stuck fast there . Incantations she sang over him . First she charmed away the pain which afflicted the god . Then the stone quivered and grew loose . The heart of Thor leapt within him when he perceived that Groa would give him healing , and he was consumed with desire to reward her , and to gladden her  | heart without delay . So ere she sang further , he spake and she was silenced . Of Orvandel 's peril Thor gave Groa tidings , and of how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who encompassed him about . With joy was Groa 's heart filled , but the spell she wrought was broken , and the memory of the magic song passed away . Thus was she unable to take from Thor 's forehead the splintered flint , and there it ever remained because of his impatience to give premature reward . So there was ever after weakness in Thor . Nor must mortal fling across his dwelling a flint weapon , lest the stone in the Asa-god 's forehead be shaken , for then he would have suffering , and be moved to wrath against an offender . Great were the deeds of Thor , which brought security to gods and men , for by him were the giants driven back and their power suppressed . Unto him , therefore , was willing service at all times rendered . But there fell a day when Odin went forth from Asgard and towards the east . He saw Thor coming out of Jotun-heim , and sought to mock him so that he might have mirth . Elivagar ran deep , and Odin waited on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferryman . Thor called upon him , but Odin refused to cross , whereat there rose a dispute between them . The valour of Thor did Odin question , and his feats belittle . With scornful laughter , too , did he receive the angry threatenings of the thunder-god . " Nimble is thy tongue , " cried Thor , " but it would help thee little if I waded across to thee . Louder than the wolf thou wouldst howl if I struck at thee with Mjolner. "  | " Better wouldst thou be engaged , " Odin answered , " if thou didst hasten home ; because there is one there whom Sif loves better than thee . " Thor was wroth . " Well dost thou know , " he cried , " that thy cruel words sting me . A coward art thou who speakest what is untrue . " Odin answered : " Truly I speak indeed . . . . Thou art tardy in returning . Why art thou lingering on thy way ? ' T were better if thou hadst set forth on thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou who delayest me , villain , " Thor answered wrothfully . Odin smiled . " Can one of so little account as I am , " he said , " delay the journey of the great Asa-god Thor ? " " Cease thy bantering , " cried Thor ; " hasten hither with thy boat , and thou shalt have the friendship of the sire of Magni . " " Begone ! " cried Odin . " I shall not cross thee . " Then said Thor , with pleading voice : Show me the ford then , since thou wilt not come over . " Odin wagged his head . " That is easy to refuse , " he said . " The way is long . Thou canst go a little way this direction , and a little way in that ; then thou canst turn to thy left till thou dost reach No-man's-land . There wilt thou meet thy mother , who shall guide thee unto Odin 's land . " " Can I go thither to-day ? " Thor asked . Odin answered : " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . " " Mocker , " exclaimed Thor , " our talk is ended ! Thou hast denied me crossing this day , but by the holy waters of Leipter , 1 swear that I shall reward thee indeed when next we meet . "  | Odin smiled : " Begone ! " he cried ; " and may demons seize thee . " Then took Thor his departure in great wrath , nor did he ever discover again the ferryman Greybeard who had mocked him and put him to shame .  | Balder the Beautiful The Summer Sun-god ?

Like fine gold was his hair , and his eyes were radiant and blue . He was well loved by all the gods , save evil Loke , who cunningly devised his death . Balder , the summer sun-god , was Odin 's fairest son ; his mother was Frigg , goddess of fruitful earth and sister of Njord . His brother was blind Hodur . On Balder 's tongue were runes graven , so that he had great eloquence . He rode a brightly shining horse , and his ships , which men called " billow falcons " , were the sunbeams that sailed through the drifting cloudways . For wife he was given Nanna , the moon maid , the brave one who fought with him the light battles . On a bright horse she rode also , and tender was she and very fair . There came a time when Odin and Balder went forth to journey through a wood . A dread omen forewarned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  | horse ? the horse from whose hoofmarks bubbled forth clear wells . Charms were sung over the sun-god by Nanna and by her fair sister Sunna , the sun maid . Frigg also sang , and then Fulla her sister . Odin uttered magic runes to protect him from evil . But soon after Balder began to languish . The light went from his eyes , care sat on his forehead , and melancholy were his lips . To him came the gods beseeching to know what ailed him , and he told that nightly he dreamed fearsome dreams which boded ill , and revealed to him , alas ! that his life was in dire peril . Now Frigg , who had fore-knowledge of all things save Balder 's fate , sent forth her maid-servants to take oaths from all creatures living , from plants and metals , and from stones , not to do any hurt unto the god Balder . To her , in due time , the maidens returned , and she received from them the compacts and vows that were given . All things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmless , from which no vow was asked , for it clung , as was its need , to a strong tree for protection . Then was Frigg 's heart filled with comfort , and no longer did she fear the fate of her noble son . But the heart of Odin was filled with foreboding . He mounted his horse Sleipner , and went over Bif-rost towards the north , and descended unto darksome Nifelhel , where dwelt the spirits of the great giants who were crushed in the World-mill . On the borders of Hela , as he rode speedily , a great and fierce hel-dog came after him . There was blood on its breast , and in the darkness it barked loudly . When it could go no farther , it howled long with gaping jaws . Over a long green plain went Odin , while the hoofs of Sleipner rang fast and clear , until he came to a high  | dwelling , the name of which is Heljar-ran , of which the keeper is Delling , the Red Elf of Dawn . Therein have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their descendants who shall come at Time 's new dawn that shall follow Ragnarok to regenerate the world of men . To the eastern gate went Odin , where he knew there was the grave of a Vala ( prophetess ) . Dismounting from Sleipner , he chanted over her death chamber strange magic songs . He looked towards the north ; he uttered runes ; he pronounced a spell , and demanded sure response . Then rose the Vala , and from the grave chamber her ghostly voice spake forth and said : " What unknown man cometh to disturb my rest ? Snow has covered me in its deeps ; by cold rains have I been beaten and by many dews made wet . . . . Long indeed have I lain dead . " Odin answered : " My name is Vegtam and my sire was Valtam . Tell me , 0 Vala , " he cried , " for whom are the benches of Delling 's hall strewn with rings , and for whom are the rooms decked with fine gold ? " The Vala answered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure drink indeed . Over the cup shields are laid . Impatiently do the Asmegir await him and to make merry . . . . Alas ! by compulsion hast thou made me to speak . . . . Now must I be silent . " Odin said : " Silent thou must not be until I know who shall slay Balder ? who shall bereave Odin 's son of life . " The Vala answered : " Hodur shall send his brother hither , for Balder shall he slay , and Odin 's son bereave of life . . . . Alas ! by compulsion hast thou made me speak . . . . Now must I be silent . " Odin said : " Silent thou must not be until I know  | who shall avenge the deed on Hodur , who shall raise Balder 's slayer on the funeral pyre . " The Vala answered : " A son , Vale , shall Rhind bear in the halls of Winter . He shall not wash his hands nor comb his hair until to the funeral pyre he beareth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsion hast thou made me to speak . . . . Now must I be silent . " Odin said : " Silent thou shalt not be until I know who are the maidens that sorrow and throw high their veils with grief . Sleep not until thou dost answer . " The Vala spake and said : " Thou art not Vegtam , as I deemed , but Odin , ruler of all . " Odin said : " No Vala art thou , but the mother of three giants . " Then cried the Vala : " Return , 0 Odin , unto Asgard . Never again shall I be called upon until Loke escapes from bonds and the world-devastating Dusk of the Gods is at hand . " To Asgard did Odin return ; but there was no sorrow there nor foreboding , because of the vows which Frigg had taken from all creatures and all things that are , so that no harm might be done unto her fair son . And of this had the gods full proof . Balder they made to stand amidst a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him stones , others smote him with their swords ; yet was he not injured . Of Balder were they all proud because he was charmed against wounds . To honour him did they make fruitless attack on his fair body . Evil there was in the heart of Loke , and in woman 's guise he went unto Frigg , who spake and said : " Why do the gods thus assail my fair son Balder ? " Loke answered : " It is in sport they fling at him javelins and stones and strike him with swords , because they know full well that they can do him no hurt . "  | Frigg said : " By neither metal , nor wood , nor stone , can he be injured because of the world-vows which I have received . " " Have all things indeed sworn to protect Balder ? " Loke asked with downcast eyes . " All things save the mistletoe , " answered Frigg ; " and so slender and weak is the mistletoe that from it no vow was demanded . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he carried to a cunning elf-smith named Hlebard , whom he robbed of his understanding . With the mistletoe twig the smith shaped a magic arrow ? a deadly arrow of pain . . . . Loke made haste with it to Asgard , and he went to the green place where the gods assailed Balder and made merry . He saw blind Hodur standing apart , and to him he went and spake thus : " Why , 0 Hodur , dost thou not join the game and cast a missile at Balder also ? " " Alas ! " cried Hodur ; " am I not blind ? I can see not my fair brother , nor have I aught which I can throw . " " Come and do honour unto Balder like the others , " Loke urged him . " I shall give thee an arrow for thy bow , and hold thine arm so that thou mayest know where he stands . " Hodur then took from Loke the magic arrow which the elf-smith had made and placed it in his bow . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain aim . " Thou canst now share in the sport , " said the Evil One unto the blind god , and went to a place apart . The gods beheld Hodur standing with bent bow , and paused in their game . . . . Then did the arrow dart forth . . . . It struck Balder ; it pierced his fair body , and he fell dead upon the sward .  | In horror , and frozen with silence , the gods stood around . . . . Where there had been joy and merrymaking , dumb grief prevailed . . . . Alone stood Hodur wondering and in mute amaze . But ere long angry cries broke forth , and the gods sought to slay Death 's blind archer ; but the sward on which they stood was consecrated to peace , and unwillingly were their hands withheld . Then a loud voice cried through Asgard : " Balder is dead d e a d ! Balder the Beautiful is dead d e a d ! " Every voice was hushed and every face turned pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that black hour . Thereafter arose the sound of loud lamentations , and a tempest of grief swept over the Celestial City . Frigg wept in silence and alone . Odin grieved inwardly , and more than the rest he realized the great disaster which Balder 's death would bring unto the Asa-gods . The spirit of Balder descended to the Lower World and crossed the golden bridge over the River Gjoll . The Asmegir in their gold-decked hall awaited him , for they desired that he should be their ruler until the dawn of the world 's new age . But Frigg would not suffer that Balder should remain in Hela . She went forth when the gods ceased to cry aloud in their sorrow and said : " Who among thee hath longing to win my gratitude and my love ? For such shall be given unto him who rideth to Hela to find Balder . It is my heart 's desire , in this my hour of grief , that a great ransom be offered unto Urd , Queen of Death , so that she may permit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped Heimdal the Young . He was a messenger of the gods and a son of Odin . He spake forth  | and said : " Unto Hela shall I go , 0 Queen of Asgard , as thou desirest , to find Balder and to offer great ransom unto Urd , so that she may permit him to return unto thee once again . " Then was Sleipner taken forth for Hermod , who leapt nimbly into the saddle . Swift as the wind he went over the gate bridge , and through the air and across the seas he sped and descended unto Nifel-hel towards the north to search for Balder . The gods bore Balder 's body unto the bleak shore of Ocean , where lay his great ship , Hringhorn . On its deck they built a pyre covered with much treasure , and then they sought to launch it . But that they were unable to do , because the keel stuck fast in the sand and would not be moved seaward . So they sent unto Jotun-heim for the stormgiantess , Hyrrokin , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps wind-tossed ships into the very jaws of ' Eger . On a great wolf she came and the bridle was a writhing snake . She leapt on the beach and with disdain regarded the gods . To four giants were given the keeping of the wolf . Then went she to the ship and thrust it speedily into the sea . Fire blazed from the rollers and the earth shook . Angry was Thor when he beheld the Hag , and he swung his hammer to strike her down ; but him did the gods restrain , for they sought not bloodshed in that hour . Then was Balder 's body carried to the ship and laid upon the pyre , and his steed beside him . Beautiful was he in death . In white robes was Balder clad , and round his head lay a wreath of radiant flowers . On the shore were gathered the gods and goddesses of Asgard . Odin was there , and he went first . His  | ravens hovered over the ship , and his wolf-dogs wailed . Beside him was wise Frigg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelled wheel . Queen of Asgard was she and goddess of Maternal Love . She was robed in black who was erstwhile attired in cloudy whiteness ; on her golden head were the heron plumes of silence ; a golden girdle clasped her waist and on her feet were golden shoes . Tall was she and stately and surpassing fair . Dark-browed Thor was nigh to Odin , and Brage and Tyr also . Njord , black - bearded , and clad in green , strode his stately way . With his golden-bristled boar came Frey , and Heimdal , horsed on Gulltop , shone fair as sunshine . Beauteous Freyja , veiled in tears , rode her chariot drawn by great cats , and fair Idun was there also , and Sith with harvest hair . Loke stood apart with tearless eyes . The valkyries leaned on their spears . Frigg 's maids were nigh the Queen of Asgard , and these were Fulla , her sister , Hlin , who carries to Frigg the prayers of mortals ; Gna , the speedy messenger who passes to and fro over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lovers , in whose name vows are made ; Vjofr , the peacemaker , who unites lovers , and husbands and wives who have quarrelled ; Syn , the wise doorkeeper ; and Gefjon , guardian of maids who shall never wed . White elves were assembled on that sad shore to sorrow , and even black elves were there . Many Frostgiants and Mountain-giants gathered around , for there was sadness everywhere because Balder was dead . But none mourned more than Nanna , Balder 's wife . Silent was she ; her heart wept , and fire burned in her eyes . Then Odin mounted the pyre . On Balder 's breast  | he laid the gold ring Draupner , and bending low he whispered in Balder 's ear . . . . From that hour have gods and men wondered what said Odin in his son 's ear . When Odin whispered In Balder 's ear , Nor god nor man Was nigh to hear . What Odin whispered , Bending low , No man knoweth Or e'er shall know . In silence Odin returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer . A dwarf named Littur , who ran past him , he kicked into the boat , where he was burned with Balder . So ended the ceremony of grief , and the torch was placed to the pyre . High as heaven leapt the flames , and the faces of the gods were made ruddy in the glow . . . . Nanna cried aloud in grief , and her heart burst within her , and she fell dead upon the cold sea strand . Seaward swept the burning ship . . . . The whole world sorrowed for Balder . . . . Meanwhile Hermod made his darksome way through Nifel-hel towards Hela 's glittering plains . Nine days and nine nights he rode on Sleiptier through misty blackness and in bitter cold over high mountains and along ridges where chasms yawn vast S and bottomless . On Hela 's borders the terrible wolf dog of the giant Offotes followed him , barking in the black mist . . . . Then Hermod reached the rivers . Over Slid , full of daggers , he went , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerlogar , through which Thor wades when he goes to the Lower Thingstead of the gods . He crossed shining Leipter , by whose holy waters men swear oaths that bind . At length he came to the River Gjoll and its golden bridge . Modgud , the elf maid who watches the bridge , cried aloud : " Whence cometh thou who hath not yet died ? " Of her did Hermod ask who had crossed before him , Impatient was he to brook delay . " But five days since , " she said , " there passed five troops of warriors who rode over with valkyries , yet made they less noise than thee alone . . . . Whom seekest thou ? " Hermod answered and said : " Balder , my brother , son of Odin and Frigg , do I seek . If thou hast seen him , speak forth and tell me whither he hath gone . " In silence did Modgud point towards the north , whereat Hermod spurred Sleipner and went on . . . . Soon he came to Hela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and guarded by a great armed sentinel . To none was given entry save the dead who are brought to judgment . Hermod leapt to the ground . He tightened the girths of Sleipner . He remounted again . Then he spurred Odin 's horse towards the gate , and with a great bound it leapt over , nor ceased to go onward when it came down . . . . Swiftly rode Hermod until he came to the palace in which Balder dwelt with the Asmegir . From the saddle he leapt and went within . . . . There in a golden hall he saw Balder seated on a throne of gold . Wan was his face and careworn , for the gloom of death had not yet passed from him . On his brow was a wreath of faded flowers , and on his breast the ring Draupner . He sat listening , as if he still heard the  | voice of Odin whispering in his ear . Before him stood a goblet of mead , which he had touched not . Nanna sat by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigh unto them Urd , the queen of Hela . In cold grandeur she stood , silent and alone . Deathly white was her face , and hard and stern , and she looked downward . On her dark robe gleamed great diamonds and ornaments of fine gold . . . . To Balder spoke Hermod , and said : " For thee have I been sent hither , 0 my brother . In Asgard there is deep mourning for thee , and thy queen mother beseecheth thy speedy return . " Sadly did Balder shake his head , and to Nanna he pointed . But she leaned towards him and whispered : " Love is stronger than death , nor can the grave destroy it . . . With thee , 0 Balder , shall I ever remain . . . . " They would have wept , but in Hela there are no , tears . Throughout the night did Hermod hold converse with the twain , and when morning came he besought Urd to release Balder from death 's bonds . With eyes still looking downwards she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the gods sorrow for Balder , and on earth is he also mourned . All who have being and all things with life weep for Balder , and beseech thee that he may return again . " Urd made answer coldly : " If all who have being and all things with life weep for Balder and beseech his return , then must he be restored again . . . . But if one eye is without tears , then must he remain in Hela forever . " Hermod bowed himself before Urd in silence , and turned again to Balder and to Nanna , who went with  | him to the door . . . . Ere their sad farewells were spoken , Balder gave Hermod the ring Draupner to carry back unto Odin , for in Hela the ring was without fertility . Her veil Nanna did send unto Frigg , and a bride 's gold ring she gave for Fulla . To Asgard did Hermod make speedy return , bearing the gifts of Balder and of Nanna , and unto gods and goddesses assembled together he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world did Frigg then send messengers to beseech all who have being and all things with life to weep for Balder , so that he might be restored again . Then did sorrow indeed prevail . The frost of grief was broken , and the sound of weeping was heard like to falling streams . Men wept , as did also every animal , peaceful and wild . Stones had tears , and metals were made wet . On trees and plants and on every grass blade were dewdrops of mourning for Balder . But as the messengers of Frigg were returning to Asgard , they came to a deep dark cavern in which sat Gulveig-Hoder , the Hag of Ironwood , in the guise of Thok ( darkness ) . Her they besought to weep , so that Balder might return . She spake coldly and said : " 6 Thok shall weep tears of fire only because Balder is dead . No joy hath he ever given unto me living or dead . . . . Let Hela 's queen hold what is her own . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would weep not and free Balder from death 's bonds .

" When the Gods heard , they straight arose , and took Their horses , and rode forth through all the world ; North , south , east , west , they struck , and roam 'd the world , Entreating all things to weep Balder 's death . And all that lived , and all without life , wept . And as in winter , when the frost breaks up , At winter 's end , before the spring begins , And a warm west-wind blows , and thaw sets in ?

As the Vala had foretold , a son was born to Odin , who took vengeance upon Hodur because that he slew Balder . His mother was Rhind , Earth 's Winter Queen , whom Odin wooed in the time of ice . Cold-hearted was she , although of great beauty , and long she withheld her love . Her sire was Billing , the Elf of Twilight , whose dwelling was in the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whither fled the deities of sun and moon to find safety from the pursuing wolves of Ironwood . Strong-armed were the Varns , and when Sol sank into her golden bed , their chosen warriors , who guarded her , kept watch with burning brands . By day they slept , but when Sol again drave her chariot towards Billing 's gate ' . they lit their torches , which flamed with red fire and gold . When Odin went unto Billing he revealed his love for Rhind , but the stern maid spurned with scorn the Ruler of Asgard . Displeased with himself was Odin . Footnote  | Nor , as the skald hath sung , is there " a worse disease to afflict a wise man " . Among the reeds sat Odin all alone , awaiting Rhind , yet she would favour him not . Her heart was frozen and cold . A second time Odin went towards Billing 's dwelling . He bore with him a bracelet and rings of fine gold and radiant flower-gems , and these gifts of golden summer he offered to Rhind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed cold . Her lover she despised . A third time did Odin seek to woo the stern daughter of Billing . He went unto her attired as a young warrior , his helmet on his head and his sword by his side . Stately was he as is a viking who plunders on summer seas . But the warriors of Varn stood nigh unto Rhind . Their torches were in their hands , and she slept . Sun-bright she lay upon her golden couch . . . . At morn when all the household slumbered a hungry wolf-dog guarded her . Odin she again rejected . Contumely she heaped upon him , nor could he hope to gain her love . At length Odin went unto Rhind in Hag guise . Earth 's Winter Queen languished in sickness , and he promised to cure her . Over her then Odin muttered spells , so that she was moved to tempest madness . Then was she bound with ice chains . Thereafter did Odin reveal himself to her . He took off the spell . He released her from ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became his bride . Meanwhile in Asgard the gods sought to be avenged on silent-footed Hodur for slaying Balder . But him they could not discover . All day he hid in a deep forest , and in nighttime only was he abroad . A magic shield he bore , and a magic sword , and none would dare go nigh to him when darkness fell . Ever did he move restlessly  | and without sound through the forest , fearing that the avenger would come ; ever did he seek to make escape , for of his fate he had full foreknowledge . There came a day of brightness , and it was the May day of Vale 's coming . In the night was he born in full strength , and towards Asgard he went speedily and entered therein . He had the face of a child and a warrior 's body . Straight to Valhal strode Vale , and the watchman sought to hold him back , because his hands were unwashed and his hair uncombed . A strong bow he carried and three arrows . Vale spurned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast sat Odin and the rest of the gods , and about them were the fearless heroes , the sword-slain warmen whom the valkyries had chosen . Odin received Vale with pride , and to gods and heroes he announced : " Behold it is Vale , son of Rhind , who shall avenge the death of Balder . " The gods spake one to another and said : " How can this tender youth overcome night-haunting Hodur and escape his magic sword ? " Vale answered them saying : " But one night old am I , yet shall I avenge Balder , my brother . " Then sat Odin 's new-born son at the feast . With the sword-slain warriors he shared the joys of Valhal , and ate of the boar Saehrimnir which was devoured daily and became whole again each night . Odin sate in his high chair . But he partook not of the food , for he had no need of it . His portion he flung to his dogs Gere and Freke , and drank only of the mead which nourished him forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat Heidrun , which ate the leaves of Laerath , the tree which overshadows Valhal.  | When the warriors had feasted with Vale in their midst , they issued forth in vast numbers from Valhal 's doors , which numbered five hundred and forty . From each door eight hundred warriors came out , as they shall do at Ragnarok , to combat against the hordes of Surtur . Thus daily do the warriors go forth as on the morn of Vale 's coming . On a great field they fight battles , and one another they cut to pieces . On steeds they ride and the steeds fall . On foot they rush into battle to be slain.l Yet are they ever restored again . Vale beheld the heroes in conflict . He saw them slay one another . He saw them rising to return unto Valhal . When night fell , and Sol was laid on her golden couch in Billing 's hall , Vale went forth to seek silentfooted Hodur . Through the wood of blackness he went , for he had knowledge of where the blind god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The avenger cometh , 0 slayer of Balder . " Hodur held high his magic shield . His sword he drew , and went in silence towards the sound of Vale 's footsteps . The bow of Vale was bent . He shot an arrow towards Hodur and it went past him . A second he cast and it struck the magic shield . The third arrow pierced the heart of Hodur and he fell dead . Thus was the death of Balder avenged by Vale , son of Odin and Rhind , the young May-god with a child 's face and the body of a strong warrior . A pyre was built and the body of Hodur was burned Footnote  | thereon . The gods rejoiced that he was dead , but Balder awaited him in Hela . Loke was yet unpunished ; his day of doom was drawing nigh . Ere that time came , Odin went forth from Asgard and journeyed unto Jotun-heim . There he sought the dwelling of the ancient giant , Vafthrudner , to hear from him the secrets of the past . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was also a maker of riddles , and those who could answer them not he put to death . His head he wagered that none equalled him in wisdom . Odin went towards the giant 's dwelling in the guise of a mortal named Gangraad . " Why comest thou hither ? " Vafthrudner asked . His sword was in his hand . Odin answered : " I come hither to know whether thou art so wise and all-remembering as men say . " The giant was wroth , and to Odin he said : " If thou art not wiser than I am , and if thy knowledge is less than mine , thy head shall speedily be struck from thy shoulders . If thou art proved the wiser , mine own head is forfeit . " First the giant asked Odin if he had knowledge of who drave the chariots of night and of day , and if he could name the world-dividing rivers . Odin answered him . Then the giant asked where the last battle would be fought , and Odin gave ready response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the giant marvel . He besought Odin to sit by his side . When Odin was seated , he in turn put questions to Vafthrudner . He asked of the old giant how far back he remembered , and Vafthrudner said that he had beheld Ymer 's son , Bergelmer , who escaped the  | blood deluge , when he was laid on the World-mill to be ground . Of the beginning of things Odin did ask him , and of the end . The giant made answer with great wisdom . There was naught of which he could not speak with full knowledge . Then did Odin rise from his seat and say : " One last question shall I put thee , 0 Vafthrudner , and if thou canst not answer it , thy head is forfeit . " The giant was without fear . He listened , fully assured that he could make ready response . But Odin spake and said : " Tell me if thou canst , 0 maker of riddles , what did Odin whisper into Balder 's ear ? " Then was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger was none other than Odin himself . With trembling voice he confessed that he was vanquished . So he who sought to slay the stranger was himself slain . By Odin was his head struck off . By the gods was Odin called Jalk l when he slew the great giant . But although Odin brought judgment upon the tyrant Vafthrudner , as he was wont to do unto all evildoers , it was long ere he meted out just punishment to him who had in secret devised the death of Balder . But his hour was very nigh . His place beside Fenrer awaited him . Shunned was Loke in Asgard , and rarely he went thither ; for Balder he mourned not nor shared the grief of the gods , by whom he was suspect . The time came when ' Eger sent messengers to the high Celestial city to invite the dwellers there to the harvest-end feast of the autumnal equinox . Thither Footnote  | they journeyed , robed in state , to drink of ' Eger 's mead . Now , while they sat round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feast , entered with stealthy steps . Funafeng , the guardian of the door , sought to hold him back . " No seat awaits thee here , " he said . " Thou hadst better haste to Ironwood and feast with Angerboda , mother of the Fenrer wolf . " Wroth was Loke with Eger 's servant , and more wroth was he when he heard the gods praising Funafeng because of the words he had spoken . So he turned on the bold guardian of the door and slew him . The gods rose in anger , and seized their weapons to be avenged , but Loke fled forth in the darkness and concealed himself in a deep forest at the sea bottom . Then was the feast resumed . Mead flowed plenteously from Eger 's vessels , for , like the horn of UtgardLoki , they could never be emptied , and they were ever full . Again Loke returned . Eldir guarded the door . The Evil One spake freely to him and said : " Of what do the gods speak as they drink their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldir answered , " and the evil deeds thou halt done . " " Then shall I enter , " said Loke . " I shall revile them one after another until they are covered with shame . " Silent in their anger were the gods when they beheld Loke in their midst once again . But he demanded a seat at the board . " Am I not an Asa-god ? " he cried . " The golden mead I claim as my due . " Brage , god of music and song , spake fiercely and said :  | " Thou shalt never again be an equal of the gods . For thy villainy art thou become an outcast . For thee is now prepared a drink of revenge . " To Odin did Loke make stern appeal , saying : " Promised we not each to the other in olden days , when our blood we mixed together , never to drink mead that was offered not unto both ? " When Loke spake thus , Odin consented that he should sit at the board , for indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ancient vows . A goblet of mead did Loke receive , and he cried : " Hail to all who are here save Brage , who refused me hospitality . " When he drank from the goblet he taunted Brage with scorn , and the Song-god challenged him to combat ; but Loke heeded him not . He heard him with silent scorn . To Njord then turned Loke and flouted him because that he was but a hostage of the Vans . Njord answered and said that he was father of Frey , who was hated by none , whereat the Evil One heaped abuse upon the harvest-god . But Tyr said that Njord 's fair son was the best of all chiefs among the gods , and that his doings were ever benevolent , so that by mortals was he well loved . Loke cried : " Silence , 0 Tyr . Thou hast but one hand since the Fenrer wolf seized thee . " Tyr answered : " Better to lose a hand than a good reputation , for that thou hast not , Loke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not silent , with thy wolf son shalt thou be bound . " Then did Loke taunt Frey because he had given to Gymer the Sword of Victory with which to buy Gerd . Shame fell upon Frey and on all the gods whom  | Loke reviled in that hour . Then Frigg spoke angrily to the Evil One and said : " If I had here in ' Eger 's hall a son like to Balder , who is dead , thou wouldst never go from hither , for in wrath thou wouldst be slain . " " Ha ! " cried Loke , leaping to his feet ; " is it thy will , 0 Frigg , that I should speak further ? Now hear and know that I am the cause of Balder 's death . To Hela was he sent by me , for to Hodur did I give the mistletoe arrow that struck thy son down . " The gods seized their weapons to attack their evil reviler , when suddenly thunder pealed in the hall , and Thor stood there in their midst . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dwelling of ' Eger by shedding blood . So he went and stood before Thor , whom he addressed , saying : " Dost thou remember , 0 Asa-Thor , when thou didst hide with fear in the thumb space of Skrymer 's glove ? " " Silence , thou evil one , " roared Thor , " or else with my hammer shall 1 strike thy head off and end thy life ! " Then did Loke answer humbly : " Silent indeed I shall be now , 0 Thor , for I know well thou shalt strike . " So saying he left the hall . But the gods rose to pursue him , so greatly angered were they because that he had caused Balder 's death . But Loke assumed the guise of a salmon and escaped through the sea , and in vain they sought him . Never again could he enter Asgard . The gods took counsel together and decreed that Loke should be bound because of the many evils he had done , and especially because he devised the death of Balder . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him not , for a cunning retreat had Loke discovered . In a cliff he dwelt behind a great  | waterfall . Four doors there were in his cavern , and they were ever kept open , so that he might make quick and sure escape . There he devised plots to overcome the Asa-gods . But wearily passed the days of his solitude . One morning he took flax and yarn and fashioned a net with which to capture fish , and in the manner which he made it have fishermen ever since fashioned theirs . He took pride in his cunning work , but for what end he devised it no man knoweth . Meanwhile the gods sought greatly after him . Then Odin mounted his golden throne and looked over the nine worlds , searching for the place in which Loke was hidden . He saw the cavern behind the waterfall . He perceived Loke sitting within . Then he called the gods and told them where the Evil One could be found . Then set they forth and made cunning approach to the cavern . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but not until they were very nigh to him . Then he flung his net upon the fire , and in salmon guise leapt into the pool which was below the waterfall . There he concealed himself betwixt two stones . When the gods entered the cavern they knew that the Evil-worker whom they sought was not far distant , for the fire still smouldered . Kvasir , son of Njord , who was keen-eyed as Heimdal , at once beheld on the white embers the ashes of the net which Loke had made . So the gods sat down and speedily they wove another of like kind . When it was finished they threw it into the stream , knowing that he whom they sought was there . But the net went over Loke . Then did the gods take the net a second time , and weighted it with stones so that it could be dragged along  | the stream 's bed . Loke divined their purpose , and leapt over the net into the waterfall But the gods espied him , and Thor went into midstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the avengers drag the net towards the pool . Loke perceived that there were but two means of escape left to him . One was to again leap over the net ; the other was to swim out to the sea and brave the perils that are there . He chose to leap . But he escaped not , for Thor grasped him in his hand . In vain Loke sought to wriggle free , but Thor closed his strong fingers over his tail . That is why the salmon 's tail has been narrow since that day . When Loke found he could not escape , he assumed his wonted shape . Then did the gods do as Frey had threatened at Eger 's feast . Him they bore unto the place where his son the wolf Fenrer was already bound on the geyser-sprayed island in the gulf of Black Grief . Loke 's two sons , Vali and Narvi , followed him , as did also gentle Sigyn , his wife , whom he had despised and wronged . Incantations were sung over Vali , and he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tore him to pieces . Then did the gods lay Loke on three sharp-edged rocks next to the Fenrer wolf . With the sinews of Narvi ( the binder ) they made chains which were like iron , and with these they bound the Evil One securely . Skade came from her mountain home rejoicing because that he who had caused the death of her father , Thjasse , was at length overcome . She bore with her a poisonous snake , and bound it on the rock above Loke 's head . From its jaws dropped burning venom , which tortured the Evil One with great agony . Then took the avengers their departure , leaving Loke  | in torment . . . His faithful wife Sigyn remained behind . Over Loke 's head she is ever holding a goblet to receive the dripping venom . So does she constantly guard her evil husband . But when the vessel is filled to the brim she must needs bring it down , so that it may be emptied . Then do venom drops fall upon Loke 's face , burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles madly with his bonds , and the rocks shake and Midgard trembles to its foundations . . . . It is thus that earthquakes are caused . On the island of the Gulf of Black Grief must Loke and the Fenrer wolf remain until Ragnarok .

With his bright sword the watchman  | of Bif-rost takes his head . But even after death is the Evil One avenged , for his head strikes the body of Heimdal , who is grievously wounded thereby and brought to life 's end . " There is no longer fear in Hela ; the sons of Mimer rejoice because that Loke is dead . " Thor is engaged in fierce combat with the Midgard serpent . Long is the strife and uncertain . The serpent is coiled and uncoiled ; it writhes before Thor ; it avoids his hammer blows , and over him it pours floods of venom . Terrible is the wrath of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreading that he will be overcome . But at length he prevails . Thunder bellows loud and Mjolner flashes fire as Thor smites the deathblow , and the monster is stretched dying upon the plain . Great renown , indeed , hath the God of Thunder gained , yet pays he life 's cost for the victory . With its last fierce breath the serpent sends forth suffocating venom fumes , and Thor staggers back nine paces . Then with a thunder groan the victor falls dead . . . . " How fares Odin in this dread hour ? He combats with the ravenous wolf Fenrer , the avenging monster which broke free from its bonds . From earth to heaven its jaws gape . Fiery flames dart from its nostrils and from its eyes . Odin fights with his spear Gungner , and violent are his blows . He rides on Sleipner ; on his head gleams his helmet of gold ; his blue robe streams behind . Fearless is Odin and proud , and his form is stately in this his hour of doom . Naught can avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his splendour , and by the wolf is he devoured . " Yet shortlived is the triumph of Fenrer . Strong Vidar the Silent advances speedily to avenge his sire 's death . His iron-shod foot is stamped on the monster 's  | under jaw . He struggles fiercely with the terrible wolf , for he is stronger and must prevail . In the end he tears asunder the great jaws , and plunges his spear in Fenrer 's heart through that throat of fire . Thus Odin is avenged . . . . " How fares the Asa-hosts when Odin and Thor fall , and Tyr and Frey lie dead ? The heroes of Valhal are scattered , hordes of giants are killed , and the field is wet with blood . The black dragon Nidhog is soaring through the air with rustling wings . It flies towards the plain of battle and swallows the bodies of the dead . . . . Surtur alone prevails .

He casts his firebrands against the scattered Asa-hosts , and those who remain are burned up , save Vale and Vidar , sons of Odin , and Modi and Magni , sons of Thor . Midgard is swept by flame ; the smoke curls round mountain tops ; all things are burned up ; nothing with life remains . Asgard is scorched , and fire envelops the withering trunk of Ygdrasil . Even Nidhog is destroyed in its flight . . . . Earth , smouldering and black , sinks into Ocean ; the billows cover it . . . . " Now there is naught but thick blackness and silence unbroken .

Waited he also for the song 's end and the promise of Time 's new morning , when evil would cease to be and Balder would come back . The skylark soars till its song falls weakly ; at morn is its singing fresh and sweet . Sweet , too , and fresh was the song of the Vala when Odin heard , sitting in his throne , her voice falling through the stillness , afar off but clear . " In Hela 's realms there is sure defence . None goeth thither to conquer , and the long swords are unstained with blood . The fire hath reached not the Underworld . Mimer 's seven sons , who have awakened , sleep not again .

Midgard 's serpent they call to mind and the wolf Fenrer . They forget not the judgments of the  | gods and the antique mysteries . They remember the sacred runes of mighty Odin .

Waiting for Grendel ? Beowulf keeps Watch . To Ask and Embla , the first man and the first woman , did the gods impart divine attributes when they had but tree life , and were of little might and without destiny . Naked they stood before Odin at the seaway end . Perceiving their conscious shame , he gave unto them divine garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dwelt , on the shore edge of Western waters , and their children multiplied , and their children 's children . The lives of mortals were long in those days ; they were yet innocent , and dwelt together in peace . The Golden Age prevailed in Asgard , nor had the Evil One of Ironwood corrupted the gods . In after days Heimdal , son of Odin and of the nine Vana-mothers who were daughters of sea-dwelling Ran , was given from out of Gjallarhorn a wisdom draught of Mimer 's mead . Then became he a child in human guise . In a fair ring-stemmed ship was he laid , wrapped in soft slumber , and his pillow was a golden grain sheaf , the gift of Frey , god of harvest . Around him were heaped great treasures , war glaives and full armour , weapons and tools ,  | which the gods had made in Asgard . The sacred fireborer took Heimdal also with him ? he who was called Stigande , the journey-maker . There came a sunbright morn when men , looking westward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue sea a fair ship , and on the stem shone golden rings . Nigh it came , and it found a safe harbour and lay therein . With wonder the people beheld on the deck a man-child wrapped in soft slumber ; his pillow was a golden grain sheaf , and they named him Scyldl of the Sheaf . Him they took unto their chief 's home , and there he was nourished and fostered tenderly . The treasures that were in the ship gave great riches and power unto the tribe , and they received knowledge to grow grain and to use the sacred fire . When the child reached to wise manhood , he became a ruler among men , and long were his years . Of Heimdal have skalds sung that thrice were sons born to him of earth mothers . The first was Thrall , from whom thralls are descended ; the second was Churl , sire of freemen ; and the third Jarl , from whom all nobles have sprung . So when warriors assembled to feast together and drink mead , and ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give ear all ye divine races , great and small , sons of Heimdal " . Scyld of the Sheaf achieved great renown . He who was received as a helpless child became a great and good king . He drove invaders from the shores , he scattered ravaging bands , and among the tribes he was regarded with awed Indeed he waxed so powerful that tribute Footnote  | was paid to him by the people who dwell beyond the seaway of whales . A man-child was born unto Scyld . He was named Beowulf ' , and when he came to years of strength and knowledge he won fair repute . Among the followers of his sire he distributed many money gifts , so that he won their favour ; ready were they indeed to serve him in wartime . When Scyld was of great age , he departed at his fateful hour to go into the keeping of the Lord . According to his dying request his faithful subjects carried him down to the seabeach . There in the small harbour lay the ship in which as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go seaward , the vessel waited him in wondrous wintry beauty , glistening with hoar frost and ice . By the mast , on the broad bosom of the ship , the mourners laid down their well-beloved lord , the generous giver of golden money rings . Great treasures they heaped around him ? graven ornaments from distant lands , armour and weapons of war and bright swords ? and on his breast they put many gems . As rich and numerous were the gifts they gave as were those they had received with the child in other years . Over the dead king they hoisted a banner of gold . . . . Then was the boat let loose . . . . The tide bore it away to the heaving ocean . . . . Thus in deep sadness was the king given unto the sea , while his people sorrowed for him , watching from the shore . . . . No man can tell who received that fair ship 's burden Beowulf then reigned over the Scyldings , and was honoured and well loved . His son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warrior , and when he waxed old he was yet fierce in battle . Four children Footnote  | he had ? Herogar , a captain of war men ; Hrothgar , who became king ; Halga the Good ; and Elan , the queen of a Swedish chieftain . Hrothgar was a strong leader , and won many great battles . He received willing service , and under him the young war-men increased in numbers , until he commanded a mighty army . Then bethought he to have a great Hall built , with a larger feasting room than was ever heard of among men . For that purpose were workers from many tribes put in service , and in due season was erected the high , horn-gabled building which was called Heorot , and it awaited the devouring flames . There was much feasting and merriment in the great Hall . A fierce man-eating monster , which dwelt in darkness , was made angry by the revelry , the music of harps , and the cheerful songs of skalds . One ' was in the hall , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth in the midst of the encircling sea , and did set the sun and moon in the heavens to give light and cover the land with branches and leaves . Thus did war-men live happily indeed in the Hall , until the Hell-fiend began to work evil . Grendel was his name , and he hovered by night on the marches and held moorland and fen . By the Creator were he and his kind banished to their dark lairs , because they were the kindred of Cain , the slayer of Abel , whose evil progeny were monsters and elves and sea-demons , as well as the giants who fought with God , for which he paid them their reward . Now it happened that in the midst of the night the demon Grendel entered the silenced hall to discover who were lodged there after beer-drinking . He beheld a Footnote  | band of high war-men who had feasted , and were wrapped in deep slumber ; they had forgotten sorrow , that woeful heritage of men . With fury was the demon possessed , and thirty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exulting heart to his lair with that fill of slaughter . At daybreak there was grief and loud wailing in the Hall . The great and honoured prince sat moodily , stricken with great sorrow , and gazed at the blood track of the fierce demon . His distress was long-lasting , and deep . On the next night the demon Grendel returned , and did more murderous deeds . Nor had he any regret thereat , so much was he steeped in crime . Then was it easy indeed to find men who sought inner chambers by night . He alone who found farthest retreat escaped the fierce fiend . ' Then became Grendel the master indeed . For the space of twelve long winters Hrothgar endured because of the demon great sorrow and deep loss . Minstrels went abroad making known in song the ceaseless outrages and fierce strife . No offering would Grendel take , nor could the greatest war-man who was seized expect to escape his doom . He entrapped young and old ; on the mist-dark moorlands he seized his victims night after night . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray that the soul destroyer would give them release from the demon . So did the heathen , as was their custom , remember hell , for they knew not the Creator , the Judge of Deeds , the Lord God , nor could they praise the Lord of Glory .. Then did Beowulf , a thane among the Geats , come to hear in his fatherland of the deeds of Grendel . In his Footnote  | time he was the strongest among living men , and he was noble as he was indeed mighty . " Get ready my good wave-traverser , " he said . " I shall go unto Hrothgar over the swan-way ; he hath need of men . " The prudent , who depended on his aid , sought not to hold Beowulf back ; they urged on the stout-hearted hero , and looked eagerly for favourable omens . Beowulf selected fourteen of the finest war men to go with him , and took also a sea-skilled mariner , who knew the landmarks along the path of Ocean . Then to the ship they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The warriors , bearing their arms , walked on to the stem , while the sea waves were washed against the sand . The armour and ornaments were placed on board , and then the willing heroes pushed into deep water the strong timber-braced ship . Like to a bird was that swift floater , necked with white foam , driven by favourable winds over the sea waves . All night they sailed on , and next day they beheld high and shining cliffs , steep mountains , and bold sea-nesses . So came they to the seaway end ; the voyage was over and past . The heroes leapt speedily from the ship and made it fast to the shore . Their armour clinked as they turned inland , while they thanked God that the seaway had been made easy to them . Then there came towards them the Coast Guardian of the Scyldings , riding upon his horse along the shore . He shook his strong spear shaft as he drew nigh , and he spake , saying : CC Who are ye who in a high ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Know ye that I keep watch over the shore so that sea plunderers may not do harm to Denmark . Never have I beheld armed  | men landing more openly ; nor know ye the password of friends . Nor ever have I beheld a greater earl than this one among you . Unless his looks belie him , he is no home-stayer . Noble is his air . . . . Ere you advance farther to spy out the land , I must know who ye are . Now , listen to me , sea travellers from afar , my frank advice is that ye reveal at once from whence ye come . " That shore guardian did Beowulf answer thus : " We are Geats , the hearth friends of Hygelac . My sire Ecgtheow , the noble leader , was renowned among the people ; he is remembered by every wise man . Now know that we come seeking thy king , the son of Healfdene , protector of the people . Be thou our guide . A great mission is ours , nor need its purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thou knowest if it is true , that a malignant foeman works evil by night among the Scyldings . I can council Hrothgar how the fiend may be overcome and his misery have end . " On his horse sitting , the fearless shore guardian spake in answer , saying : " A shield war man shall judge well between your words and deeds . Friendly are you , I hear , to the ruler of the Scyldings . Then pass onward in armour carrying your weapons . I shall guide ye . My comrades shall guard thy ship , so that the well-loved man , thy leader , may return over the sea tides to the borders of the Weders . To him it is assured that he shall come unscathed through the battle crush . " Together they went on their way until they came to the high and gold-decked Hall of Hrothgar . The shoreguardian pointed towards it and said : " Now must I take my departure . May the Almighty protect you all in your adventure . To the seashore I must hasten to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the Hall . Sea-weary  | they all were , and they placed their shields and armour against the wall ; they put their spears together and rested on benches . A warrior , who was Hrothgar 's messenger , asked them whence they came . " Never , " said he , " have I seen bolder strangers . It would seem that ye have come to seek Hrothgar , not because of exile , but because of your bravery and noblemindedness . " Then did Beowulf reveal who he was and seek audience with the king , and his message did Wulfgar bear unto Hrothgar , who sat , grey-headed and old , among his peers . " As a youth I knew Beowulf , " the aged ruler said . " He comes to a sure friend . Of him have I heard that his hand hath the strength of thirty men . The holy God hath sent him hither as a help against the dreaded Grendel . " So he bade the messenger welcome Beowulf and his men and usher them to his presence . When Beowulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing before him in shining armour . " In my youth , " he said , " I have undertaken great exploits . In my fatherland heard I of the evil deeds of Grendel , and my people counselled me , knowing my great strength , that I should come hither . For they know well that I avenged the sorrow of the Weders , bound five of their foes , slew a brood of giants , and killed sea monsters by night . . . . Alone shall I go now against this demon , this giant Grendel ! " Then asked Beowulf as a boon that he alone with his warriors should be left to cleanse the hall of the monster . Having heard that Grendel had no fear of weapons , he also made known his desire to contend with him un-  | armed . " With the fiend , " he said , " I shall wrestle for life , foe against foe . " Hrothgar accepted Beowulf 's offer with gladness , and granted him the boon he sought . Then was a bench cleared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank of bright liquor . Songs were sung by a clear-voiced minstrel . There was much joy in the hall among the Danes and the Weders , who were no small company . When they had feasted , and the queen bore the cup round the heroes , young and old , she greeted Beowulf , who , when he had drunk , said he had vowed to slay Grendel or perish in his clutches . The old queen was much pleased to hear the words which the great hero spake . Loud revelry was heard in the hall once more until Hrothgar desired to go to his couch . Well he knew that the night-haunting monster would attack the hall when the sun 's radiance was dimmed and shadows fell , and dusky shapes were stalking under the clouds . Then the whole company arose and greeted the heroes . Hrothgar greeted Beowulf and wished him success and power in the hall . " Be mindful of thy renown , " the king said , " make known thy great might , be watchful against the foe . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou shalt survive this conflict . " Whereupon Hrothgar went forth with all his warriors , leaving the hall to Beowulf and his men . When he was thus left alone with his heroes , the chief of Geats took off his armour , and gave his decorated sword to his thane . Ere he lay down in bed he said : " No less in fighting strength than Grendel do I
