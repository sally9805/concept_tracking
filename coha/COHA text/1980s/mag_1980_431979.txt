 | 4 P.M. Sixteen-year-old Debbie Dubose skipped down the front steps of her Chicago home on a sunny April afternoon . She waved to her parents as she slid into her late 's yellow sports car . 4:30 P.M. The telephone call from the hospital sent Clyde and Naomi Dubose , Debbie 's parents , reeling in shock : " There 's been a terrible wreck and your daughter is in the hospital in a deep coma . " When the Duboses arrived at the hospital , they were told that Debbie had already been officially pronounced " dead . " Her brain was not functioning , and only a respirator was keeping her heart beating by forcing oxygen through her lungs . The grief-stricken parents recalled that Debbie had written a term paper on organ transplants and donations and had mentioned several times that she wanted her organs to be used in any way that could help others . Following their daughter 's wish , Debbie 's parents gave permission to use her organs . 5:10 P.M. The beeper Paul Taylor wears on his belt went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center at Denver . It had already been a long day for the transplant unit . A routine day frequently begins at 4 or 5 A.M. and the unit often works around the clock . The Denver center is one of only three hospitals in the world where livers are transplanted . ( The others are in Minneapolis , Minn. , and Cambridge , England . ) Charles Halgrimson , M.D. , professor of surgery and vice chairman of the department of surgery at Colorado 's Health Sciences Center , has removed more livers than any doctor anywhere . He handles the donor part of the procedure , making sure the living organs are taken out properly . A very tall man ? six feet , seven inches ? and in his mid40s , Dr. Halgrimson is of Norwegian extraction and grew up on a North Dakota farm . Thomas Starzl , M.D. , chairman of the department of surgery and director of the organ-transplant program , does the implantation in the recipients . Slightly built , he is 53 years old and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience gave him the background for writing more than 800 scientific articles since completing his medical training at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore , Md . Pioneers in organ transplants , these two doctors have 50 oncedoomed patients now walking  | around with donor-livers to attest to their success . At the center , the kidneytransplant team has performed 1,000 transplants and there are 600 people alive today because of the kidneys they received . The beeper told Taylor to call his operator for a message . He cradled the phone and wrote swiftly as he listened . A teenage girl in Chicago , whose parents had given blanket permission to donate her organs , was being kept on a respirator . Taylor took down all the essential information , including blood and tissue type . He then called Dr. Starzl to tell him about the donor . " Do n't stand there , " Dr. Starzl answered . " Get moving . " " Where 's Dr. Halgrimson ? " Taylor asked . " He 's on his way home . We started early today , " Dr. Starzl said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep on the plane . " 5:15 P.M. Taylor turned to a secretary : " Please make three reservations on the seven o'clock flight to Chicago . " A few minutes later , Taylor dialed Dr. Halgrimson . " We 've got a donor in Chicago and reservations for you on a seven o'clock plane . " On her phone the secretary was saying to the airline reservation clerk , " I do n't care if the plane is booked , we have to have three seats on that plane . " On his phone , Taylor asked Dr. Halgrimson , " Who do you want to assist ? All right . I 'll see if I can locate him . Do n't hesitate to call for a police escort to the airport if you 're running late . " Dr. Starzl burst into the office of the transplant unit . " Start pulling the files of those on the waiting list for livers and kidneys , " he told the secretary . " Find out who 's got the blood type and antigen profile that match the donor 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If not , contact California and Minnesota . " The transplant fellow chosen to assist Dr. Halgrimson found the keys to the storage room in the adjoining research building where special coolers , solutions and surgical bags are stored . He raced there , made a fast inspection and collected the necessary equipment ? including a wrench in the event the donor 's respirator needed repairs . 6 P.M. As members of the Denver team headed for their plane , eye specialists in Chicago were measuring Debbie 's corneas . Since corneas must be removed within two hours of death , the eye-bank program was already under way . 7:02 P.M. Dr. Halgrimson , his assistant and Taylor settled into their plane seats . Now they had to prepare themselves for the ordeal of facing Debbie 's grieving parents . As the father of five children , Dr. Halgrimson finds this one of the hardest parts of his job . He and his associates always make a point of explaining everything in precise detail because they want the family 's fully informed consent . Meanwhile in Denver , Dr. Starzl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafeteria , then went over the list of possible recipients for Debbie 's liver and kidneys . Her liver had to be transplanted within 18 hours at the most ? but eight hours would be better . The time limit for implanting kidneys is 36 hours , if they are simply preserved , more if they are kept alive by machine . Dr. Starzl thumbed through files . He remembered the recent desperate visit to Denver by a New York couple with their five-year-old daughter who had been born with a defective liver . For two years , she 'd lived in isolation to avoid contracting a disease her frail body could not combat . A liver transplant was her only hope of survival . When Dr. Starzl had told Howard Jennings , the father of the little girL that there was no liver donor for his daughter and he must take Shayla home to wait , Jennings had wept . Cathy Jennings , the girl 's mother , had cried too . Now , with growing hope , Dr. Starzl compared blood types and other characteristics . Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialed the Jennings ' number in New York . 7:25 P.M. As the Denver team flew eastward toward Chicago , the Jennings hastily packed and started for the airport ,  | their hopes soaring . Their small car crawled along the snarled expressway . Howard checked his watch for the tenth time and cursed at the heavy traffic . After all the obstacles Shayla had already hurtled , surely a traffic jam would n't now keep her from receiving the organ that meant the difference between life and death . Howard gripped the steering wheel , his knuckles white . Cathy repeatedly wiped tears from her eyes .. Their car inched along . 8 P.M. The phone rang in the Denver home of Dave Sadler . Dave had been on the kidney waiting list for many months . Once a productive member of society . Dave had lost so much time from work , been sick so often and spent so many hours on dialysis that he no longer held a steady job . His situation made it hard on his wife and four children . When he got his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath of hope and gratitude . Now maybe he could plan a future without the burden of being hooked up to a machine for 15 hours every week . 8:40 P.M. Alice Wiggington answered her phone in Cheyene , Wyo . Alice had about given up hope for a kidney and resigned herself to three-times-a-week dialysis . Now she hung up the phone with trembling hands . " John ! " she cried out to her husband , " I 'm going to get a kidney transplant . " Quickly , she packed her bag and , in a high state of exhilaration , hugged her two girls . " Keep your things picked up and take care of Daddy , " she admonished them . " When I get home , we can do things we 've never done before . . . . But as her husband sped her along the interstate to Denver , Alice began to cry . " There 's nothing to worry about , " John said reassuringly . " Someone had to die for me to get a kidney , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , Paul Taylor marveled at the number of persons who could benefit from the generosity of a single donor . Corneas , liver , heart , pancreas and kidneys could all be used to help others . Dentists could fill gum-line depressions , treat gum diseases and make properly fitting dentures for many persons with bone marrow from one donor . Burn victims could benefit from microscopic layers of surface skin taken from the abdomen and thighs with electric razors and rolled in antibiotic gauze sponges and refrigerated until needed . Growth hormone from the pituitary gland could help stunted youngsters . If needed , inner-ear structures could be taken at the same time the pituitary gland was removed . All this , and it could still be possible for the donor 's family to have an open-casket funeral . Taylor could n't help thinking that a greater educational program was needed to get more people to sign donor cards . 10:20 P.M. The three men hurried off the plane , hailed the first cab and sped across Chicago . It would be a long night . The operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whenever donor organs are offered and must be used immediately , the surgery is frequently performed at night ? sometimes after midnight ? and is finished well before scheduled operations begin the next morning . 11 P.M. Taylor talked gently to Debbie 's grieving family and got the needed signatures . Dr. Halgrimson and his assistant made preliminary examinations and arrangements for nurses and an operating room . There would be no OR available until 2:30 A.M. 3 A.M. Debbie lay on the operating table in front of the transplant-surgery team . Her blood circulated , her heart beat and she breathed with the aid of the respirator . She was a " living cadaver . " Dr. Halgrimson swiftly made an incision and studied her organs . " The liver is normal in size and appearance , " he told Taylor . With that pronouncement . Taylor rushed to call Denver . He 'd make another call when the liver and kidneys were out . At the airport . he 'd call again to reassure Dr. Starzl they were on schedule . Meticulously , Dr. Halgrimson isolated the arteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , if a single blood vessel was accidentally severed , the organ would be useless . He made the donor vessels ready to clamp . 4 A.M. Finally , Dr. Halgrimson carefully lifted Debbie 's liver , placed it in a thick , sterile plastic bag , twisted the neck of the bag and tied it . He placed this package inside another sterile plastic bag , repeated the sealing , then put a sterile towel over the ice in the cooler and placed the liver on top . Next Dr. Halgrimson began the tedious task of removing the girl 's kidneys . Two hours later , both shiny kidneys lay immersed in preservation fluid in their separate round plastic containers with tight fitting lids . Halgrimson 's assistant " burped " the lids to remove air bubbles and placed the containers in an outer insulated container that looked like a picnic cooler . Even though Debbie 's liver and both kidneys had been removed , the rhythmic whoosh , whoosh , breathing sound of the respirator continued . 6 A.M. Removing the organs had presented no unusual problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight back to Denver was scheduled for 8 A.M. There was time to get to the air terminal without requesting a police helicopter or escort . Bone marrow , the pituitary gland , inner ear structures and skin could all be taken after the respirator was turned off . Dr. Halgrimson let out a ragged breath . He looked at the clock once more , but this time as a delaying tactic . " That 's it , " the father of five said . " We do n't need the respirator any more . " At first no one moved . Then , slowly . Taylor found the lighted power button and turned off the machine . The respirator stopped . Silence enveloped the room . For a moment everyone stood still . Then Taylor picked up the cooler and the three men left .  | 7 A.M. Through Chicago 's early morning traffic , the yellow cab wove its way toward the airport . The three team members checked in at the ticket counter of O'Hare terminal . The two doctors passed through flight inspection . Taylor asked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection . The unsuspecting attendant opened the container . " What 's this ? " She asked . " Liver , " Taylor answered . " Yeecht ! " she said . " And this ? " she pointed a finger at the plastic bowls . " Kidneys . " " Yeecht ! " she said again . She looked at Taylor disbelievingly but waved him through . The three men dozed while their jet whisked them back to Denver . While Dr. Halgrimson and his associates were en route to Chicago 's airport , Dr. Starzl began preparing little Shayla for surgery in Denver . ( Yes , the Jennings made their plane . ) Taylor had phoned in the measurements of the donor liver . Shayla 's bad liver had caused her abdomen to stretch and swell , so the transplanted liver , although larger , would fit . Blood characteristics and tissue similarities looked promising . Dr. Starzl had not had much sleep , but he felt good . He was about to do what he did best . He made an incision from side to side under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time the plane from Chicago landed in Denver , he would have the child 's blood vessels isolated and stripped from their connective tissue . He used the same careful method to prepare Shayla that Dr. Halgrimson had applied in removing the liver from Debbie However . Shayla 's own liver would not be removed until Dr. Halgrimson arrived and Dr. Starzl was certain the transplanted liver would function . For this reason , Dr. Starzl never burns any bridges . At the last possible moment , he could still close Shayla and send her back to her room to await another donor liver . 9:35 A.M. Back at his Denver hospital , with no time to rest after his flight , Dr. Halgrimson scrubbed again for surgery . Every artery , vein and vessel leading to and from Debbie 's liver was indelibly printed on his mind . He would now assist in the implantation because his knowledge would save crucial time . 10 A.M. Dr. Starzl , Dr. Halgrimson and many associates , using powerful magnifying loupes , worked over Shayla for five hours , connecting tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. At last the doctors pushed the loupes up past the frames of their glasses and watched the liver take on color and firmness and begin producing bile . The doctors ' eyes met and they exchanged pleasant smiles . The two chief surgeons stepped back and mo- tioned for colleagues to take over the closure . Now Dr. Starzl and Dr. Halgrimson began their routine day of seeing patients , educating medical students , training residents and working on administrative details . 5 P.M. Dr. Starzl and Dr. Halgrimson joined Dr. Richard Weil and Dr. Lawrence Koep in surgery where Dave Sadler was to receive Debbie 's left kidney . In an adjoining operating room , Alice Wiggington was being prepared to receive the girl 's right kidney . 7 rm . The kidney specialists had already done preliminary vessel preparation and removed Alice 's nonfunctioning kidney . Now Dr. Weil slipped a chilled wet piece of gauze over the donor-kidney to get a better grip on it . Gently he removed the kidney from the preservation unit . The hours ticked away as the surgeons and nurses worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped up and down like a Yo-Yo . Then he bent to the task of assisting the other doctors connect the artery and vein . Finally the ureter was implanted in the bladder . Dr. Weil asked a nurse to check under the table to see if the catheter drained urine . It did . " That 's it , " he said . After the respirator was turned off , the comforting sound of the patient 's breathing continued . The surgeons closed the incision . 4 A.M. The two kidney transplants had taken 10 hours . It was 35 hours since this drama , this grim contest with time , life , and death had begun . Fatigue gnawed at all of them . " I 'm going to crash , " Dr. Halgrimson said . Dr. Starzle nodded . Crash was the only word to use when you 've gone that long without sleep . Each went to his home and slept round the clock . The next day , as the two surgeons made their hospital rounds in Denver , miles away in Chicago , Debbie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral home , the director asked if they preferred an open or closed casket service . " Closed , " they said , " but first we want to see her . " With tears rolling down their cheeks , they stood looking at their child . But their agony was eased with the knowledge that through Debbie others lived . Already they knew that a 14-year-old boy who had been blinded three years earlier had received one of their daughter 's corneas , and a child born with thinning corneas and glaucoma had received the other . A month later , as was Dr. Starzl 's custom , he contacted the Duboses . First he told them that their daughter 's liver was functioning in a five-year-old girl who had been bedridden and doomed to die . ( Minutes before he had made the phone call , little Shayla had run down the hospital corridor , grabbed Dr. Starzl around the legs and hugged him . ) Next he told the Duboses about the man and woman who received the kidneys giving them complete details except the recipients ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter 's identity would not be revealed as promised . The Duboses thanked Dr. Starzl for his report . " Thank you ! " Dr. Starzl said . And for years to come , people whom Clyde and Naomi Dubose will never meet will be saying , " thank you , " to their daughter , Debbie , and asking blessings on her ? without ever knowing her name .
