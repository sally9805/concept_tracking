Rarely a day goes by now that there is not a reference to Yuri Andropov in the President 's morning intelligence report . Fragments from spies , diplomats , generals and businessmen are eagerly collected and fitted into the giant mosaic that American experts are assembling . As Ronald Reagan prepares to do psychological battle over the deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe , no task is more important than understanding the mind of this protagonist . <P> The files in the veiled recesses of the Kremlin bulge with material on Reagan . The Soviets know everything from the size of his biceps to the way he conducts himself at closed-door meetings . By contrast , U.S. intelligence analysts do not even know whether Andropov drinks vodka . The Soviet leader at this point is little more than a neat , dark blue suit filled with cold air . But we have made a start in putting some flesh and blood under the suit . <P> He has a singular stoop that forces his chin down , perhaps the result of an injury . Part of his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does not appear weak , nor does he appear robust . He has a gracious manner with strangers . His handclasp is firm , his hair gray . He is less bulky than the stereotyped Soviet leader , but not thin . <P> We are not certain of his height ( 5 ft. 10 in. or 11 in. ) or his weight ( possibly 180 ) . We are not absolutely sure who his parents were , how much schooling he had ( he apparently never completed higher education ) , or whether his wife is alive or dead . Nor do we know for certain whether he speaks or understands English . We do know that a son speaks English and that a daughter writes stories for a Soviet culture magazine . Andropov 's affinity for the arts is hearsay because there are no confirmed reports of him at the theater or in museums . <P> The way he walks and carries himself indicates he is not physically agile . Disappearances from public life in the past suggest some bad health , probably cardiovascular trouble . Compared with Leonid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable . But those few Americans who have seen him face to face ( Vice President Bush and Secretary of State Shultz are two of only a handful ) report that he seems more fragile than most men his age . Shultz noted that Andropov acted like " a man who had been in charge . " Still , analysts are not yet convinced he has full control in the Kremlin . <P> Several stories suggest to the experts that Andropov has an ability to put people at ease , even those who might fear him . Still , there is no hint of the humanity that bubbled from Brezhnev when he was drinking vodka or hunting wild boar . Andropov has no record as a sportsman . He seems totally urban , in complete contrast to the rural flavor of Khrushchev and Brezhnev . It is assumed , but not proved , that Andropov spent his formative political years in Karelia , on the Finnish border . What he did during World War II is also sketchy . Presumably , Andropov was involved in the bitter fighting at Leningrad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
