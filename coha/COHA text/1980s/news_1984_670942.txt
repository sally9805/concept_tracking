Further complicating the process has been the position of the union representing hospital and nursing-home workers , District 1199 of the Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union , A.F.L.-C . I.O. // The union , which broke its affiliation with the national union in the spring under the leadership of its president , Doris Turner , is torn by internal strife . This put Mrs. Turner in the position of negotiating under severe pressure , knowing that her future would turn on the outcome. // One of the largest problems in the strike , in the estimation of those involved , was the stand taken by Governor Cuomo . He has refused to do what the state had done in the past - to guarantee the cost of the settlement . Despite repeated statements that he would not increase state aid to pay for a settlement , some of the hospitals thought he would ultimately bail them out , and they wasted time and energy trying to get him to do so . He did not. // " I don ' t think I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , " Basil A. Paterson , the special Federal mediator , said late Saturday night as he stood in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel , talking about the agreement reached upstairs minutes before. // " It was the longest , the most difficult , most intricate strike I ' ve been involved in , " said William Abelow , the chief negotiator for the hospitals . " It was the one with the most missing pieces , the one with the most outside parties involved. " // Victor Gotbaum , president of the city ' s largest municipal union , District Council 37 of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , was not at the negotiations , nor were the other municipal labor leaders. // Their formal talks with the city began in the spring but were stalled by the hospital strike . The contracts , covering 200 , 000 civilian workers and 54 , 000 uniformed workers , technically ended July 1 but by state law the contract provisions remain in force. // Although the leaders were not there , their influence was felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the negotiations of a consultant to the municipal unions . Mr. Gotbaum has said that the two sets of negotiations were related. // And just yesterday , Mayor Koch increased the city ' s offer to Uniformed Firefighters Association by a full percentage point , to 3 percent . The percentage is expected to rise more before settlement. // " There ' s always linkage , I ' ve never denied that , " said Mr. Gotbaum , who argued for some weeks that the strike was harmful and should be brought to an end. <> <> 6 Percent Is Sought // // Mr. Koch has told aides that he is convinced the strike could have been resolved sooner were it not for the influence of the municipal leaders . They are said to be seeking annual wage increases of 6 percent , and no less than 5 percent , for their members. // To suggest that anybody in the labor movement tried to influence Mrs. Turner is " idiocy , " said a municipal union consultant , Jack Bigel . His chief deputy , Allen Brawer , was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mrs. Turner , who rejected wage increases of 3 and 4 percent and agreed to 5 percent in each of the contract ' s two years , said that no one told her what to do . But , she added , " you can ' t separate everything from everything else. " // The most involved of the outsiders was the traditional insider : the state . <> <> Cuomo Departs From Past // // The state - which controls most of the hospitals ' income by regulating Medicaid and Blue Cross insurance rates - has in the past imposed health-care settlements and financed them by increasing the reimbursement rates. // But this year , Governor Cuomo said he was changing that . In line with legislation that controls reimbursements , he said , the hospitals would have to live within limits. // In other words , he was telling the union and the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes , the bargaining group for the hospitals , that they would have to do what they had never done before - negotiate a contract on their own. // They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many involved in the talks , the two sides did not know or trust each other . In many ways , the negotiators spent the first weeks of the strike getting to understand one anothers ' postures . The process was one marked by anger , mistakes and , most damaging , Mr. Paterson has suggested , distrust . <> <> No ' Bag of Money ' // // " Difficulties come when you ' re trying to change patterns , and the Governor was trying to change the pattern of the state coming in with a bag of money where there is an impasse , " Mr. Paterson said. // He and others wondered if the Governor ' s stand , though successful from Mr. Cuomo ' s point of view , resulted in such disruptive negotiations that Mr. Cuomo might have to reconsider the posture of nonintervention when the the next round of hospital negotiations begin in two years. // The Governor ' s top aides say no . His position - no more complicated than a push for cost-containment , according to his secretary , Michael DelGiudice - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner said she believed that the hospitals made their initial wage offer of 3 and 4 percent , which she said led to the strike , to get the state involved . The hospitals said their offer was made in good faith . <> <> Dr. Axelrod Is Assigned // // " The Governor kept telling them there would be no more state money , but I think it took them the first couple of weeks to believe it , " Mr. DelGiudice said . " I think both sides did not believe he really meant it. " // The Governor eventually sent in a state negotiator - later than he should have , some contend - but continued to reiterate that additional state money was not going to be available . The negotiator was Thomas Hartnett of the State Office of Employee Relations. // But at the same time , the State Health Commissioner , Dr. David Axelrod , whom the Governor had assigned to " stand by " the negotiations , announced at the request of the hospitals how much money the state thought the hospitals would have available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a panel of economists. // The guideline showed that insurance reimbursement rates would increase by about 6 1/2 percent next year . The union thought this meant the hospitals could afford wage increases of about 6 percent a year . As it turned out , the announcement made matters worse when the hospitals offered less. // Dr. Axelrod said he had had no choice but to respond to the hospitals ' request and given them the state ' s estimate . Others nonetheless fault him. // " He ' s a monumental guy but that , I think , was a mistake , " said Mr. Gotbaum . " You don ' t put in numbers when people are negotiating. " // Mrs. Turner said she had known of the estimate but had never seen it . She denied it had impact on the bargaining. // She placed the blame for the length of the strike on the hospitals . Others cite her problems within her union. // That Mrs. Turner ' s standing in the union has had some impact on the process seems clear . The day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her election that the court had no jurisdiction over the issue . But Mrs. Turner ' s opponents may still take their challenge to the Federal Department of Labor. // <> <> Much Second-Guessing // Some attribute the settlements that disintegrated to Mrs. Turner ' s status. // " She was probably as much concerned with her enemies in the union as with the package , " said one labor expert . " That probably caused a great deal of second-guessing. " // A week ago , for example , the union scheduled a ratification vote at Madison Square on a tentative settlement nearly identical to the one agreed upon over the weekend. // But the vote did not take place because the agreement had fallen apart. // That night , Mrs. Turner stood in the wings of the Garden , waiting for something in writing from the hospitals . She telephoned Mr. Paterson in his suite at the Roosevelt Hotel . He produced notes he had prepared as mediator , and got Mr. Abelow to initial them . They were delivered by messenger to the Garden , but there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the points that had been agreed upon , she said . It is usual at the end of a strike for parties to agree to general terms and then to work out the details of a contract over several weeks , sometimes months . Mrs. Turner said the hospitals had known she had wanted something in writing for days and had deliberately refused . <> <> Lack of Trust // // The reason for much of what happened , Mr. Paterson contended , was lack of trust on both sides - an atmosphere made worse by hospital administrators who boasted how well they were doing without their workers and workers who resorted to violence. // There were also staff problems during the negotiations - the fact that the union had a number of lawyers , that the hospitals included in the talks administrators whose institutions were not yet on strike because their labor contracts had not expired. // Even after the tentative settlement was reached , both sides were speaking ill of each other , Mr. Paterson pointed out . His own independence as a mediator was questioned by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably would want the support of the union . Not so , said Mr. Paterson , with a weary shrug. // " You know , ' he mused , " I doubt that everything is ever going to be told about this . At least not while the people involved are still in power . Nobody wants to hurt them. " // //
