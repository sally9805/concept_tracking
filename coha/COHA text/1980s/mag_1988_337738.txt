Most horror stories appeal to a collective memory of childhood , the sense of being small and vulnerable in a world filled with large , mysterious beings . Portrayals of innocence or helplessness stalked by danger produce responses that are largely involuntary and hence all but fail-safe : a reader 's skin crawls , a moviegoer looks away from the screen or screams . One variation on this formula is its mirror opposite : an evil child is born into an unsuspecting , defenseless society . This situation crops up in folk literature , with tales of changelings or of sleeping women seduced and impregnated by incubi , and occasionally appears in popular entertainments like The Bad Seed and Rosemary 's Baby . Not many serious writers have risked such a plot . It reeks of discredited superstitions and demonologies ; it suggests , contrary to liberal , enlightened opinion , that wickedness is inborn and intractable . <P> So perhaps it should not be surprising that the latest of Doris Lessing 's more than 30 books tells of the birth of a monster . Throughout her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her early fiction carried a strong , if artfully submerged , feminist message . Later , when the women 's movement gathered force , she did not join the parade but rather devoted her energy to a cycle of five science-fiction novels . She criticized the West when its power seemed paramount . When the enemies of democracy grew threatening , she changed her emphasis ; in The Good Terrorist ( 1985 ) she showed civilized London under siege by mindless anarchists . The Fifth Child admirably continues this iconoclastic tradition ; it is scary , engrossing and radically disturbing . <P> At a London office party in the mid-1960s , boy meets girl . David Lovatt , 30 , and Harriet Walker , 24 , share the same unfashionable dream of settling into married life and having lots of children . David , whose parents divorced when he was seven , wants to create the stable home he lacked while growing up ; Harriet , a virgin , hopes to replicate her untroubled childhood . They find a huge Victorian house within commuting distance of London . It costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his wealthy father agrees to take on the mortgage payments . <P> Despite the initial skepticism of relatives and friends , the Lovatts ' experiment gets off to a brilliant beginning . In quick succession , four healthy children are born . Over Christmas and Easter vacations and during the summers , the house overflows with in-laws : " People came and went , said they were coming for a couple of days and stayed a week . " Harriet 's chores and recurrent pregnancies are eased by the almost constant presence of her mother , whose labor subsidizes this enterprise just as thoroughly as the money from David 's father . But cost hardly seems to matter , measured against what it has helped to achieve : " Happiness . A happy family . The Lovatts were a happy family . It was what they had chosen and what they deserved . " <P> Immersed in the coziness of their own creation , sensing themselves admired by their less fortunate houseguests , David and Harriet succumb to smugness . " We are the center of this family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet and me . " Harriet chimes in , " This is what everyone wants , really , but we 've been brainwashed out of it . People want to live like this , really . "
