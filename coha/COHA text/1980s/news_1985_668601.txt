Bob Pulford ' s wife , Roslyn , said her heart can ' t take many more of these one-goal games . Her husband said he ' ll take as many as he can get . The Black Hawks continued to make up for lost time Thursday night to the dismay of the Pittsburgh Penguins and the delight of a crowd of 15 , 628 in the Stadium . They edged the Penguins 5-4 to score their fourth straight one-goal victory since Pulford , the team ' s general manager , gave coach Orval Tessier a pink slip that wasn ' t a Valentine and assumed command as interim coach . " As long as we keep winning them , it ' s great , " Pulford said . " There ' s not a game we go into that I don ' t think we can win . But I honestly didn ' t think we ' d win all four  --  I thought three out of four . " The winning streak is the Hawks ' longest this season , but the Norris Division-leading St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-place Hawks by trouncing the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 Thursday night . " Tonight we were fortunate , " continued Pulford . " We won on sheer effort . We weren ' t sharp . I don ' t think there was a person in our dressing room who felt we were playing well . " It helped that the Hawks were playing one of the dullest teams in the National Hockey League  --  at least in terms of its record . The Penguins haven ' t won since Jan. 19 , when they rallied to upend the Hawks 5-4 . Since then , they have an 0-9-1 record . But though the Penguins are dull on paper , they tend to be dynamic on the ice , thanks to rookie sensation Mario Lemieux . In this game , the 19-year-old center flaunted the skills that made him the No. 1 choice in June ' s National Hockey League draft and the Most Valuable Player in Tuesday ' s All-Star Game . Lemieux set up the Penguins ' first goal by fellow rookie Warren Young and scored their second and third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Bannerman and those Hawks entrusted with the responsibility of shadowing the elusive and resourceful rookie . " I didn ' t realize Lemieux is as good as he is , " said Pulford . " He ' s great , " said Hawk defenseman Jack O ' Callahan . " You ' ve really got to watch him . He ' s always in the openings . Then , when you try to go at him , he dishes the puck off . " Fortunately , we ' re getting the confidence to win the tight ones . When push comes to shove , we know we can win it . " This time it was O ' Callahan who unexpectedly provided the impetus . The defense-oriented defenseman scored the deciding goal  --  and his fourth goal of the season  --  on a shot from the blue line 29 seconds into the final period . " I was just trying to keep it low and just get it on the net , " said O ' Callahan . " Troy Murray , Curt Fraser and Ed Olczyk were charging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebound . " O ' Callahan ' s goal was insurance for Bannerman at the time , staking him to a 5-3 lead . It turned out to be essential when John Chabot scored for the Penguins with 2 minutes 23 seconds left in the game . The Hawks didn ' t lead until 14 seconds remained in the second period , when Murray scored off a dandy feed from Fraser to make the score 4-3 . Murray talked more about Lemieux than his own derring-do . " He ' s going to be a great player in a few years , " he said . " He has the size ( 6 feet 4 inches , 200 pounds ) , the hockey sense and he ' s great with the puck . Right now he ' s all offense , and that ' s the way it should be . If he starts worrying about defense , he won ' t be the same player . " There was another rookie front and center in the game , Hawk right wing Dan Frawley , the 204th pick overall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday against the Boston Bruins , when he was chosen the No. 2 star , Frawley scored the second and third Chicago goals to graduate to No. 1 star . Another conspicuous contributor was second-year man Ken Yaremchuk . The winger drew a pair of penalties and scored the Hawks ' first goal off Pittsburgh goalie Roberto Romano on a power play . Yaremchuk seems certain to remain on the roster . But Pulford soon will have to make a decision regarding Frawley . Should the rookie be sent back to the Hawks ' Milwaukee farm team when left wings Al Secord and Darryl Sutter come off the disabled list ? " I think Frawley has played very well , " Pulford said . " He ' s going to make some of the other guys work harder for their jobs . " Secord ( out since early December with a groin injury ) will be back this weekend . Then we ' ll get Sutter and ( defenseman ) Keith Brown back . Those two could play if we were going into a playoff game . " But the Hawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two games will be against one of the weakest teams in the NHL , the Detroit Red Wings . The teams will meet in a Saturday matinee in Detroit and in a Sunday-afternoon rematch in the Stadium .
