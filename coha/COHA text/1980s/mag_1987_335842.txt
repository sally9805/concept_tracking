Her grandmother Bettye Fisher received a bank statement indicating that the IRS had taken the girl 's money as partial payment for a delinquent tax bill of $21,182 owed by her grandfather Charles Fisher . Since the age of two , Carmin had been putting pennies into a coffee can labeled with another adage reflecting Franklin 's sentiments  --  A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED  --  and gradually transferring the money to the bank account . <P> When a local newspaper publicized the story , area residents collected enough pennies to refill her can and then some .
