This is the blunt message in various international disarmament forums from such Western countries as Australia and Sweden . It ' s also West Germany ' s more discreet message - to avoid offending the United States - at the current month-long conference reviewing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in Geneva. // There , as at the UN Committee on Disarmament earlier this year , Bonn is proposing installation of a world-wide seismic monitoring system even before any ratified underground test ban . The machinery would then be in place , it says , to supplement the nuclear powers ' own verification of compliance with any agreement . And it could be continuously upgraded to detect ever lower yields of explosions. // // The US , while supporting the West German proposal as part of a far-off comprehensive test ban ( CTB ) , sees little immediate utility in it . Washington argues that sensors outside the country in which tests are being conducted are not capable of quantifying yields accurately without on-site inspections . On these grounds it has never ratified the superpower Threshold Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests to 150 kilotons , nor has it ratified the companion 1976 treaty on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions ( PNE ) . // Both superpowers have pledged to observe the 150-kiloton ceiling anyway , but pending American ratification , the Soviet Union will not exchange data for calibrating sensors as stipulated in the treaty . Nor will Moscow proceed - until the US signs and ratifies a CTB treaty - with the unprecedented step of installing 10 American tamper-resistant ' ' black boxes ' ' on its soil. // This had already been agreed upon in the American-Soviet-British CTB negotiations that ran from 1977 until the West broke them off in 1980 in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. // Despite Bonn ' s soft language , West German documentation submitted in Geneva makes it clear that Bonn does not share the strong American skepticism about monitoring technology . According to the documentation , even 100-kiloton explosions - a third less than the 1974 treaty limit - are now identifiable by sensors outside the testing country , while swiftly improving technology will soon make 50-kiloton blasts equally identifiable . Out-of-country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-kiloton explosions within four to eight years. // These figures apply to tests in dry , unconsolidated rock , which softens explosions . The same blast in wet , hard rock could be monitored at 50- , five- , and one-kiloton yields respectively , according to the West German analysis . Japanese Ambassador to UN disarmament talks Ryukichi Imai , a nuclear engineer , identifies one-kiloton explosions as the lower limit at which marginal additional improvements in monitoring are far too costly to pay off . One-kiloton and smaller detonations can be used to test nuclear artillery , neutron warheads , and triggers for larger fusion or hybrid weapons. // The West German documentation does not quantify the uncertainty resulting from evasive actions like setting off detonations in salt mines or other large cavities , but notes that verification of such tests would require a supplemental network of in-country unmanned ' ' black-box ' ' sensors spaced 500-1 , 000 kilometers apart. // Imai says that evasive actions ( known as ' ' decoupling ' ' ) in a cave can muffle explosions by an additional factor of two to three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . Explosions in the Soviet test site of Kazakhstan , for example , take place in a major rock formation that extends directly to a measuring station in Uppsala , Sweden - and a 50-kiloton explosion in Kazakhstan is therefore identifiable in Sweden with a mathematical ' ' confidence level ' ' of 80 percent , Imai notes . He estimates at about 25 the total number of ' ' black boxes ' ' needed inside the Soviet Union for high confidence in measuring even low yields. // There has been dramatic improvement in the state of the art that is now producing high-level monitoring capability . Recent advances in US technology - as in the US seismic array installed in Norway last June - offer further refinements in measuring blasts. // Bonn ' s proposal , in the by now sleepy realm of nuclear test bans , is significant because of the current five-month Soviet moratorium on all nuclear tests - and the superpower public-relations duel prior to the November summit . The West German proposal thus puts to the test the commitment of the superpowers to the pieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past two decades. // The 1963 Soviet-American treaty forbidding all but underground nuclear tests , the 1968-70 NPT , the signed but unratified 1974 TTBT and 1976 PNE , and the Soviet-American-British CTB negotiations from 1977-80 all presumed a comprehensive test ban treaty as a goal . And a number of impatient third-world signatories of the NPT are beginning to ask why they should abide by their pledge not to acquire nuclear weapons if the superpowers aren ' t abiding by their pledge to reduce their stockpiles and the number of their nuclear tests. // For its part , Moscow still proclaims the goal of CTB . By contrast , the Reagan Administration never resumed the CTB negotiations that petered out in 1980 . In 1982 it made the explicit policy decision not to do so . While the administration says that CTB continues to be a ' ' long-term goal , ' ' it sets the priority in arms control on radical reductions of offensive nuclear weapons , and it pays little attention to the search for test bans. // When Moscow announced a unilateral five-month nuclear test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American government spokesmen said that a moratorium now would be unfair , since the Soviet Union had just completed three underground tests , while the US needed to finish its own planned series of tests. // President Reagan initially speculated that after these tests are completed next year , America might be willing to join the Soviets in a permanent test moratorium , with on-site inspection . White House advisers quickly quashed this notion , however , saying the President was ' ' not proposing any new initiative ' ' in testing . Follow-up press reports out of Washington indicate that the US wants to keep testing available in any case for the new MX and Trident and for future Midgetman missiles and also - more controversially - for nuclear pumped X-rays for the Strategic Defense Initiative. // As something of a counterproposal to the temporary Soviet moratorium , Washington invited Soviet representatives to observe American testing and calibrate any measuring instruments they might wish to . The Soviets , not wanting to reciprocate , have declined the invitation. // // // //         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
