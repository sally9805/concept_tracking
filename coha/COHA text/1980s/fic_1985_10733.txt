" How do you make a cave , Talut ? How do you make a place like this ? " Ayla asked , remembering how Brun had searched for just the right cave for his clan , and how homeless she had felt until she found a valley that had a livable cave . " If you want to know , I will tell you . It is not a big secret ! " Talut said , grinning with pleasure . He was delighted with their obvious admiration . " The rest of the lodge is made the same way , more or less , but for this addition , we started by pacing off a distance from the wall outside the Mammoth Hearth . When we reached the center of an area that we thought would be large enough , a stick was put in the ground  --  that 's where we would put a fireplace , if we decide we need a fire in here . Then we measured off a rope that same distance , fastenedone end to the stick , and with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go . " Talut acted out his explanation , striding through the paces and tying an imaginary rope to a nonexistentstick . " Next , we cut through the sod , lifted it out carefully , to save it , and then dug down about the length of my foot . " To further clarify his remarks , Talut held up an unbelievably long , but surprisingly narrow and shapely foot encased in a snug-fitting soft shoe . " Then we marked off the width of the bench  --  the platform that can be beds or storage  --  andsome extra for the wall . From the inside edge of the bench , we dug down deeper , about the depth of two or three of my feet , to excavate the middle for the floor . The dirt was piled up evenly all around the outside in a bank that helps support the wall . " " That 's a lot of digging , " Jondalar said , eying the enclosure . " I 'd say the distance from one wall to the one opposite is , maybe , thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes opened in surprise . " You 're right ! I measured it off exactly . How did you know ? " Jondalar shrugged . " Just a guess . " It was more than a guess , it was another manifestation of his instinctiveunderstanding of the physical world . He could accurately judge distance with his eye alone , and he measured space with the dimensions of his own body . He knew the length of his stride and the width of his hand , the reach of his arm and the span of his grasp ; he could estimate a fraction against the thickness of his thumb , or the height of a tree by pacing its shadow in the sun . It was not something he learned ; it was a gift he was born with and developed with use . It never occurred to him to question it . Ayla thought it was a lot of digging , too . She had dug her share of pit-traps and understood the work involved , and she was curious . " How do you dig so much , Talut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattocks to break up the Io:un ,  |p251shovels  to scoop it out , except for the hard-packed sod on top . We cut that out with the sharpened edge of a flat bone . " Her puzzled look made it plain she did n't understand . Perhaps she did n't know the words for the tools in his language , he thought , and stepping outside the door , returned with some implements . They all had long handles . One had a piece of mammoth rib bone attached to it , which had been ground to a sharp edge at one end . It resembled a hoe with a long curved blade . Ayla examined it carefully . " Is like digging stick , I think , " she said , looking to Talut for confirmation . He smiled . " Yes , it 's a mattock . We use pointed digging sticks , too , sometimes . They are easier to make in a hurry , but this is easier to use . Then he showed her a shovel made from the wide palmation of a giant antler of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shaped and sharpened . Antlers of young animals were used ; the antlers of mature giant deer could reach eleven feet in length , and were too big . The handle was attached by means of strong cord strung through three pairs of holes bored down the center . It was used , spongy side down , not to dig , but for scooping up and throwing out the fine loess soil loosened by the mattock , or , if they chose , for snow . He also had a second shovel , more scoop-shaped , made from an outer section of ivory flaked from a mammoth tusk . " These are shovels , " Talut said , telling her the name . Ayla nodded . She had used flat pieces of bone and antler in much the same way , but her shovels had had no handles . " I 'm just glad the weather stayed nice for a while after you left , " the headman continued . " As it is , we did n't dig down as far as we usually would . The ground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down deeper and make some storage pits , too , maybe even a sweatbath , when we get back from the Summer Meeting . " " Were n't you going to hunt again , when the weather got nice ? " Iondalar said . " The bison hunt was very successful , and Mamut is n't having much hick Searching . All he seems to find are the few bison we missed , and it is n't worthwhile to go after them . We decided to make the addition instead , to make a place for the horses , since Ayla and her horse were such a help . " " Mattock and shovel make easier , Talut , but is work . . . a lot of digging , " Avla said , surprised and a little overcome . " We had a lot of people to work at it , Ayla . Nearly everyone thought it was a good idea and wanted to help . . . to make you ' ( Iconic. , " Tlw voting woman felt a sudden rush of emotion and closed herp252eyes to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and turned aside out of consideration . Jondalar examined the walls , still intrigued with the construction . " It looks like you dug it out between the platforms , too , " he commented . " Yes , for the main supports , " Talut said , pointing to the six enormousmammoth tusks , wedged in at the base with smaller bones  --  parts of spines and phalanges  --  with their tips pointing toward the center . They were spaced at regular intervals around the wall on both sides of the two pairs of mammoth tusks , which were used for the arched doorways . The strong , long , curved tusks were the primary structural members of the lodge . As Talut of the Mammoth Hunters continued describing the construction of the semisubterranean earthlodge , Ayla and Jondalar becameeven more impressed . It was far more complex than either had imagined . Midway between the center and the tusk wall supports were six wooden posts  --  tapering trees , stripped of bark and crotched on top . Around the outside of the annex , braced against the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , supported by shoulder blades , hipbones , spinal bones , and several strategically placed long bones , legs and ribs . The upper part of the wall , consistingmainly of shoulder blades , hipbones , and smaller tusks of mammoth , merged into the roof , which was supported by wooden beams stretched across and between the outer circle of tusks and the inner circle of posts . The mosaic of bones , all deliberately chosen and some trimmed to shape , were wedged in and lashed to the sturdy tusks , creating a curved wall that fit together like interlocking pieces of a puzzle . Some wood was available from river valleys , but for building purposesmammoth bones were in greater supply . But the mammoths they hunted contributed only a small portion of the bones they used . The great majority of their building materials were selected from the prodigious pile of bones at the bend in the river . Some bones even came from scavenger-stripped carcasses found on the nearby steppes , but the open grasslands were more important for providing materials of another variety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make way for the next year 's rack , and each year they were gathered up . To complete the dwelling , the antlers of the reindeer were bound to one another to make a strong framework of interlaced supports for a domed roof , leaving a hole in the center for smoke to escape . Then , willow boughs from the river valley were tied together into a thick mat , which was laid across and bound securely over and around thep253antlers , and tapered down the bone wall , to create a sturdy base over the roof and the wall . Next , an even thicker thatch of grass , overlappedto shed water , was fastened to the willows all the way to the ground . On top of the grass thatch was a layer of dense sod . Part of the sod came from the ground that had been excavated for the addition , and part from land nearby . The walls of the entire structure were two to three feet thick , but one final layer of material remained to complete the annex . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed explanation of earthlodge construction . " I was hoping the weather would clear , " he said , making an expansive gesture toward the clear blue sky . " We need to finish it . Without finishing , I 'm not sure how long this will last . " " How long will a lodge last ? " Jondalar asked . " As long as I live , sometimes more . But earthlodges are winter homes . We usually leave in summer , for the Summer Meeting and the big mammoth hunt , and other trips . Summer is for traveling , to gather plants , to hunt or fish , to trade or visit . We leave most of our things here when we go , because we come back every year . The Lion Camp is our home . " " If you expect this part to be home to Ayla 's horses for very long , then we better finish it while we have the chance , " Nezzie interjected . She and Deegie set down the large , heavy skin of water they had hauled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying digging tools and dragging a large basketfull of compact wet soil . " I 've never heard of anyone making a lodge , or even part of one , this late in the season , " he said . Barzec was right behind him . " It will be an interesting test , " he said , setting down a second basket of slick mud , which they had dug from a particular place along the riverbank . Danug and Druwez appearedthen , each carrying additional baskets of the wet mud . " Tronie has a fire started , " Tulie said , picking up the heavy skin of water brought up by Nezzie and Deegie , by herself . " Tornec and some others are piling up snow to melt , once we get this water heating . " " I like to help , " Ayla said , wondering how much help she would he . Everyone seemed to know exactly what to do , but she did n't have any idea what was going on , much less what she could do to help . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , it 's for the horse , " Deegie commented , " but let me get you something old of mine to wear , Ayla . It 's a messy job . Does Taint or 1 ) anug have something for Jondalar ? " " I 'll find something for him , " Nezzie said.  | " If you are still so eager after we are through , you can come and help put up the new lodge Tarneg and I will be making to start our Camp . . . after I join with Branag , " Deegie added , smiling . " Has anyone started fires in the sweatbaths ? " Talut asked . " Everyonewill want to clean up after this , especially if we 're going to have a celebration tonight . " " Wymez and Frebec started them early this morning . They are gettingmore water now , " Nezzie said . " Crozie and Manuv have gone off with Latie and the young ones to get fresh pine boughs to make the baths smell nice . Fralie wanted to go , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down hills , so I asked her if she would watch Rydag . She 's watching Hartal , too . Mamut is busy doing something for the ceremony tonight , too . I have a feeling he 's planning some kind of a surprise . " " Oh . . . Mamut asked me , when I was coming out , to tell you that the signs are good for a hunt in a few days , Talut . He wants to know if you want him to Search , " Barzec said . " The signs are good for a hunt , " the big headman said . " Look at this snow ! Soft underneath , melting on top . If we get a good freeze , it will have a crust of ice , and animals always get stuck when the snow is in that condition . Yes , I think it would be a good idea . " Everyone had been walking toward the fireplace , where a large hide , filled with the icy water from the river , had been propped over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to start the process of melting the snow that was dumped in . As it melted , bas-I kets of water were dipped out and poured into another large , stained , and dirty hide that lined a depression in the ground . The special soil , taken from a bank near the river , was added and mixed with the water to form a thick slurry of gummy , slick clay . Several people climbed on top of the new sod-covered annex with waterproof baskets of the fine , smooth , runny mud , and , with scoops , began pouring it down the sides . Ayla and Jondalar watched , and soon joined them . Others at the bottom spread it around to make sure that the entire surface had a thick coat . The tough , sticky clay , washed and sorted into fine particles by the river , would absorb no water . It was impervious to water . Rain , sleet , melting snow , nothing could penetrate . Even when wet , it was waterproof . As it dried , and with long use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a handy place to store objects and implements . When the weather was pleasant , it was a place to lounge , to visit , to expound in loud discussion , or to sit quietly and meditate . Children climbed up when visitors came , to watch without being in the way , and everyone used the perch when an audience was needed or there was something to see.  |p255More  clay was mixed and Ayla carried a heavy basket up , slopping it over the edge , and spilling it on herself . It did n't matter . She was already covered with mud , just as everyone else was . Deegie was right . It was a messy job . As they finished the sides , they moved away from the edge and began coating the top , but as the surface of the dome became covered with wet slippery mud , footing became treacherous . Ayla poured out the last of the mud from her basket , and watched it oozing slowly down . She turned to go , not watching carefully where she was stepping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her . She fell with a plop into the fresh , soft clay she had just poured , and went slipping and sliding over the rounded edge of the roof and down the side of the horse annex , letting out an involuntary scream . The next instant she found herself caught by strong arms just as she reached the ground , and startled , looked at the mud-spattered , laughingface of Ranec . " That 's one way to spread it down the side , " he said , steadying her , while she regained her composure . Then , still holding her , he added , " If you want to do it again , I 'll wait here for you . " She felt warmth where he touched the cool skin of her arm , and she was entirely aware of his body pressing against her . His dark eyes , glistening and deep , were filled with a yearning that stirred an unbiddenresponse from the core of her womanness . She trembled slightly , and felt her face flush before she looked down , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confirming what she expected to see . He was angry . His fists were clenched and his temples throbbed . She looked away quickly . She understood his anger a little more now , realizing it was an expression of his fear  --  fear of loss , fear of rejection  --  butshe felt a touch of irritation at his reaction , nonetheless . She could n't help it that she slipped , and she was grateful that Ranec happened to be there to catch her . She flushed again , recalling her response to his lingering touch . She could n't help that either . " Come on , Ayla , " Deegie said . " Talut says it 's enough and the sweatbaths are hot . Let 's go clean this mud off and get ready for the celebration . It 's for you . " The two young women walked into the earthlodge through the new annex . As they reached the Mammoth Hearth , Ayla suddenly turned to the other young woman . " Deegie , what is sweatbath ? " " Have n't you ever taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . " Oh , you 'll love it ! You might as well take those muddy clothes off at the Aurochs Hearth . The women usually use the back sweatbath.  |p256The  men like this one . " As she spoke , Deegie indicated an archway just beyond Manuv 's bed as they passed through the Reindeer Hearth and into the Crane Hearth . " Is not for storage ? " " Did you think all the side rooms were for storage ? I suppose you would n't know , would you ? You feel so much a part of us already , it 's hard to remember that you really have n't been here that long . " She stopped then , and turned to look at Ayla . " I 'm glad you will be one of us , I think you were meant to be . " Ayla smiled shyly . " I am glad , too , and I am glad you are here , Deegie . Is nice to know woman . . . young . . . like me . " Deegie smiled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come sooner . I am going to be leaving after the summer . I almost hate to go . I want to be headwoman of my own Camp , like my mother , but I 'm going to miss her , and you , and everyone . " " How far away you go ? " " I do n't know . We have n't decided yet , " Deegie said . " Why go far ? Why not build new lodge nearby ? " Ayla asked . " I do n't know . Most people do n't , but I guess I could . I did n't think of that , " Deegie said , with a look of quizzical surprise . Then , as they reached the last hearth in the earthlodge , she added , " Take off those dirty things and just leave them in a pile there . " Both Deegie and Ayla peeled off their muddy garments . Ayla could feel the warmth radiating from behind a drape of red leather suspendedfrom a rather low mammoth tusk archway in the farthest back wall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayla followed , but stopped a moment before entering with the drape held aside , trying to see in . " Hurry in and close it ! You 're letting the heat out ! " a voice called from the steamy , dimly lit , somewhat smoky interior . She quickly scuttled in , letting the drape fall in place behind her , but , rather than cold , she felt the heat assault her . Deegie led her down a rough stairway made of mammoth bones placed up against the dirt wall of a pit that was about three feet deep . Ayla stood at the bottom on a floor that was covered with a soft , deep-piled fur of some kind waiting for her eyes to adjust , then looked around . The space that had been excavated was about six feet wide and ten feet long . It consisted of two circular sections joined together , each with a low domed ceiling  --  from where she stood , only three or four inches above her head . Hot bone coals scattered across the floor of the larger section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller section to join the others , and Ayla saw that the walls were coveredp257with skins , and the floor of the larger space was covered with mammothbones spaced carefully apart . It gave them a place to walk above the bits of burning coals . Later , when they poured water on the floor to make steam , or to wash , it would drain into the dirt below the bones , which would keep feet above the mud . More coals were piled up in the fireplace at the center . They furnishedboth heat and the only source of light , except for a faint outline of daylight around the covered smoke hole . Naked women sat around the fireplace on makeshift benches made of flat bones stretched across other mammoth bone supports . Containers of water were lined up along one wall . Large , sturdy , tightly woven baskets held cold water , while steam issued from the stomachs of large animals supported by frames of antlers . Someone picked a red-hot stone out of the fireplace with two flat bones and dropped it into one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enveloped the room . " Here , you can sit between Tulie and me , " Nezzie said , moving her ample body over one way , making room . Tulie moved the other way . She was a big woman , too , but most of her size was sheer muscularmass , though her full female shape left no doubt about her gender . " I want to wash some of the mud off first , " Deegie said . " Probably Ayla will , too . Did you see her slide down the side ? " " No . Did you hurt yourself , Ayla ? " Fralie asked , looking concerned , and slightly uncomfortable with her advancing pregnancy . Deegie laughed before Ayla could answer . " Ranec caught her , and did n't look at all unhappy about it , either . " There were smiles and nods . Deegie picked up a mammoth skull basin , dipped both hot and cold water into it , accidentally picking up a twig of pine from the hot water , and from a dark mound of some soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . " What is this ? " Ayla asked , feeling the luxuriously soft and silky texture of the material . " Mammoth wool , " Deegie said . " The undercoat they grow in winter . They shed it in big bunches every spring , right through the long outer hair . It gets caught on bushes and trees . Sometimes you can pick it up off the ground . Dip it in the water and use it to wash off the mud . " " Hair muddy , too , " Ayla said , " should wash . " " We 'll wash up good later , after we sweat awhile . " They rinsed off to billows of steam , then Ayla sat down between Deegie and Nezzie . Deegie leaned back and closed her eyes , sighingp258contentedly , but Ayla , wondering why they were all sitting together sweating , observed everyone in the room . Latie , sitting on the other side of Tulie , smiled at her . She smiled back . There was a movement at the entrance . Ayla felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked to see who was coming . Rugie and Tusie clambered down , followed by Tronie holding Nuvie . " I had to nurse Hartal , " Tronie announced . " Tornec wanted to take him for a sweatbath , and I did n't want him fussing . " Were men not allowed here , not even male babies ? Ayla wondered . " Are all the men in the sweatbath , Tronie ? Maybe I should get Rydag , " Nezzie said . " Danug took him in . I think the men decided they wanted all the males this time , " Tronie said . " Even the children . " " Frebec took Tasher and Crisavec , " Tusie mentioned . " It 's about time he started taking more interest in those boys , " Crozie grumbled . " Is n't that the only reason you joined with him , Fralie ? " " No , Mother . That 's not the only reason . " Ayla was surprised . She 'd never heard Fralie disagree with her mother before , even mildly . No one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women , Fralie did n't have to worry about seeming to take sides . Crozie was sitting back with her eyes closed ; it was amazing how much her daughter resembled her . In fact , she resembledher too much . Except for a stomach big with pregnancy , Fralie was so thin she looked almost as old as her mother , Ayla noticed . Her ankles were swollen . That was not a good sign . She wished she could examine her , then realized she might be able to , in here . " Fralie , ankles swell much ? " Ayla asked , somewhat hesitantly . Everyone sat up , waiting for Fralie 's reply , as though they all suddenly realized what had just occurred to Ayla . Even Crozie watched her daughter without saying a word . Fralie looked down at her feet , seeming to examine her swollen ankles , considering . Then she looked up . " Yes . They 've been swollen lately , " she said . Nezzie breathed an audible sigh of relief , which everyone else felt . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was n't sick this long with the first two . " " Fralie , will let me . . . look at you ? " Fralie looked around at the women . No one said a word . Nezzie smiled , and nodded at her , silently urging her to agree . " All right , " Fralie said . Avla quickly got up , looked at her eyes , smelled her breath , felt herp259forehead . It was too dark to see much , and it was too hot in the sweatbath to judge fever . " Will lie down ? " Ayla asked . Everyone moved out of the way to make a place for Fralie to stretch out . Ayla felt , and listened , and examined with thoroughness and obviousknowledge , while everyone else watched with curiosity . " Sick more than morning , I think , " Ayla said , when she was through . " I fix something , help make food not come up . Help feel better . Help swelling . Will take ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . I think he 's worried about me , but he wo n't admit to it . He 'll ask where it came from . " Crozie was sitting , tight-lipped , obviously biting back words she wanted to say , fearing if she said them , Fralie might take Frebec 's side and refuse Ayla 's help . Nezzie and Tulie exchanged glances . It was n't like Crozie to exercise so much self-restraint . Ayla nodded . " I think I know way , " she said . " I do n't know about the rest of you , but I 'm ready to clean up and go out , " Deegie said . " How would a quick plunge in the snow feel right now , Ayla ? " " I think good . I am hot . "  |p260ondalar  opened the drape that hung closed in front of the bed platform he shared with Ayla , and smiled . She was sitting crossleggedin the middle , naked , her skin pink and glowing , brushing her wet hair . " I feel so good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love it . Did you like the sweatbath ? " He climbed in beside her , letting the drape fall . His skin was pink and glowing , too , but he had finished dressing and had just combed his hair and tied it in a club at the back of his neck . The sweatbath had felt so refreshing he had even considered shaving , but just trimmed his beard instead . " I always enjoy them , " he said . Then he could n't resist . He took her in his arms , kissed her , and began caressing her warm body . She responded willingly , giving herself up to his embrace , and he heard a soft moan when he bent to take a nipple in his mouth . " Great Mother , woman , you are tempting , " he said as he pulled back . " But what will people say when they start arriving at the MammothHearth for your adoption , and find us sharing Pleasures instead of being dressed and ready ? " " We could tell them to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed out loud . " I believe you would , would n't you ? " " Well , you gave me your signal , did n't you ? " she said with a mischievousgrin . " My signal ? " " You remember . The signal a man gives a woman when he wants her ? You said I 'd always know , then you kissed me and touched me like that . Well , you just gave me your signal , and when a man gives her the signal , a woman of the Clan never refuses . " " Is it really true she never refuses ? " he asked , still not quite able to believe it . " That 's what she is taught , Jondalar . That 's how a proper woman of the Clan behaves , " she answered , with a perfectly matter-of-fact seriousness.  | " Hmmm , you mean the choice-is mine ? If I said let 's stay here and share Pleasures , you 'd make everyone wait ? " He was trying to be serious , but his eyes twinkled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only if you give me the signal , " she replied , in the same vein . He took her in his arms and kissed her again , and feeling her warm skin and warmer response , he was almost tempted to find out if she was joking or if she really meant it but , reluctantly , he let her go . " It 's not what I 'd rather do , but I think I 'd better let you get dressed . People will be here before long . What are you going to wear ? " " I do n't really have anything , except some Clan wraps , and the outfit I 've been wearing , and an extra pair of leggings . I wish I did . Deegie showed me what she 's going to wear . It 's so beautiful  --  I 've never seen anything like it . She gave me one of her brushes , after I started to brush my hair with teasel , " Ayla said , showing Jondalar the stiff mammoth-hair brush , tightly wrapped around one end with rawhideto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , tapering paint brush . " She gave me some strings of beads and shells , too . I think I 'll wear them in my hair , like she does . " " I 'd better let you finish getting ready , " Jondalar said , opening the drape to leave . He leaned over to kiss her again , then got up . After the leather drape closed , he stood looking at it for a moment , and a frown creased his brow . He wished he could have stayed with her and not had to worry about other people . When they were in her valley they could do what they wanted whenever they wanted to . And she would n't be getting ready to be adopted by people who lived so far from his home . What if she wanted to stay here ? He had a sinking feeling that after this night , nothing would ever be the same . As he turned to go , Mamut caught his eye , and beckoned him . The tall young man walked toward the tall old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use your help , " Mamut said . " I 'd be glad to help . What can I do ? " Jondalar asked . From the back of a storage platform , Mamut showed him four long poles . On close inspection , Jondalar realized they were not wood , but solid ivory ; curved mammoth tusks that had been shaped and straightened . Then the old man gave him a large , hafted , stone maul . Jondalarstopped to examine the heavy hammerlike tool since he had not seen one quite like it before . It was completely covered with hide . He could feel that a circular groove had been nicked around the large stone , and a flexible willow withe wrapped around the groove , then bound to a bone handle . The entire maul had then been wrapped with wet , unprocessed hide , which had only been scraped clean . The rawhide shrunk tight as it dried , encasing kith stone maul and handlep262in hard , tough leather , thus holding them firmly together . The shaman led him toward the firepit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , about six inches across , that was filled with small stones and pieces of bone . They removed them , then Jondalarbrought one of the ivory poles and dropped the end in the hole . While Mamut held it straight , Jondalar wedged the stones and bones around the pole , tamping them down firmly with a stone maul . When the post was firmly embedded , they put another post in , and then another , in an arc around , but somewhat away from , the fireplace . Then the old man brought out a package and carefully , with reverence , unwrapped it and withdrew a neatly rolled sheet of thin membranousmaterial of a parchmentlike quality . When it was opened , Jondalar saw that several animal figures  --  a mammoth , birds , and a cave lion among them  --  and strange geometric designs had been painted on it . They fastened it around the upright ivory poles creating a translucent painted screen set back from the hearth . Jondalar retreateda few steps to absorb the overall effect , then he looked closer , curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dried , were usually translucent , but this screen was made of something else . He thought he knew what the material was , but he was n't sure . " That is n't made of intestines , is it ? They would have had to be sewn together , and that is all one piece . " The Mamut nodded agreement . " Then it has to be the membrane layer from the inner side of the hide of a very big animal , somehow removed in one piece . " The old man smiled . " A mammoth , " he said . " A white female mammoth . " Jondalar 's eyes opened wide , and he looked again at the screen with awe . " Each Camp received a part of the white mammoth , since she gave up her spirit during the first hunt of a Summer Meeting . Most Camps wanted something white . I asked for this ; we call it the shadow skin . It has less substance than any of the white pieces , and it can not be displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that which is subtle can be more powerful . This is more than a small piece ; this encircled the inner spirit of the whole . " Brinan and Crisavec suddenly burst into the space in the middle of the Mammoth Hearth , running down the passageway from the Aurochsand Crane hearths , chasing each other . They tumbled together in a heap , wrestling , and almost ran into the delicate screen , but stopped when Brinan noticed the thin shank of a long leg barring their way . They looked up , directly at the drawing of the mammoth , and both gasped . Then they looked at Mamut . To Jondalar , the shaman 's face showed no expression , but when the seven- and eight-year-oldp263boys turned their gaze on the old shaman , they quickly got up , and carefully sidestepping the screen , walked toward the first hearth as though they had been severely scolded . " They looked contrite , almost scared , but you did n't say a word and they 've never been frightened of you before , " Jondalar said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon the essence of a powerful spirit , you see your own heart . " Jondalar smiled and nodded , but he was n't sure he understood what the old shaman meant . He 's talking like a zelandoni , the young man thought , talking with a shadow on his tongue , like those of his calling so often did . Still , he was n't sure if he wanted to see his own heart . As the boys walked through the Hearth of the Fox , they nodded at the carver , who smiled back . Ranec 's smile grew bigger when he turned his attention back to the Mammoth Hearth , which he had been observing for some time . Ayla had just appeared , and was standing in front of the drape tugging on her tunic to straighten it . Though it did n't show under his dark skin , his face flushed at the sight of her . He felt his heart pound and a tension in his loins . The more he saw her , the more exquisite she was . The long rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directed its shimmering light on her on purpose , or so it seemed to him . He wanted to remember that moment , to fill his eyes with the sight of her . He thought of her in ardent hyperbole . Her rich , luxuriant hair falling in soft waves around her face , was like a golden cloud playing with sunbeams ; her unselfconscious movements embodied ultimate grace . No one knew the anxiety he had suffered while she was gone , or the happiness he felt that she was becoming one of them . He frowned when Jondalar saw her , walked toward her and put an arm around her possessively , then stood between them , blocking his view . They walked together toward him on their way to the first hearth . She stopped to look at the screen , with obvious awe and admiration . Jondalar fell in behind her as they came to the passageway through the Fox Hearth . Ranec saw Ayla flush with warm feeling when she saw him , before she looked down . The tall man 's face flushed red when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye made it clear that there was no pleasure in his emotion . Each man tried to stare the other down as they passed by  --  Jondalar 's hard anger and jealousy apparent , Ranec trying very hard to seem self-confident and cynical . Ranec 's eyes automatically went next to the steady stare of the man behind Jondalar , the man who was the essence of spirituality to the Camp , and for some reason he felt a little abashed . They approached the first hearth , and went out through the en/trance foyer . Ayla began to understand why she had not noticed hecticpreparations for a feast . Nezzie was supervising the removal of wilted leaves and steaming grass from a roasting hole in the ground , and the smells that arose from the cooking pit made everyone 's mouth water . Preparations had begun before they went to get clay from the river , and the food had been cooking all the while they worked . Now , it only needed to be served to the Camp of hungry people . A certain variety of round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out first , followed by baskets of a mixture of bone marrow , blue bearberries , and a variety of cracked and ground seedspigweed , a mixture of grains , and oily pignon seeds . The result , after hours of steaming , had a heavy , puddinglike consistency that retained the shape of the basket after it was removed , and while not sweet , though the berries gave it a light fruit flavor , was deliciously rich . A full haunch of mammoth meat was brought out next , self-basted by the steam and the thick edge of fat , and falling apart with tenderness . The sun was setting and a sharp wind hurried everyone back inside the lodge , carrying the food with them . This time , when Ayla was asked to select first , she was n't as shy . This feast was in her honor , and though being the center of attention was still not easy for her , she was happy for the reason . Deegie came to sit with her , and Ayla caught herself staring . Deegie 's thick reddish-brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coil that was piled high on her head . A string of round ivory beads , each one carved and pierced by hand , had been coiled in with her hair and stood out as contrasting highlights . She wore a long , loose dress of pliable leather  --  Ayla thought of it as a long tunic  --  that draped in soft folds from the belted waist , dyed deep brown with a rather shiny , burnished finish . It was sleeveless , but wide at the shoulders , giving the appearance of short sleeves . A fringe of long , reddish-brown mammoth hair fell from her shoulders in back and from a V-shaped yoke in front , and hung to just below her waist . The neckline was outlined by a triple row of ivory beads , and around her neck she wore a necklace of conical seashells , spaced by cylindrical lime tubes and pieces of amber . Around her right upper arm was an ivory armband incised with an alternating chevron pattern . The pattern was repeated in colors of ochre reds , yellows , and browns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of it dyed . Attached to the belt by a loop was an ivory-handled flint knife in a rawhide sheath , and suspended from another loop , the lower section of a hollow black aurochs horn , a drinking cup that was a talisman of the Aurochs Hearth . The skirt had been cut on the diagonal , starting at the sides abovep265the knee , to a point both in front and back . Three rows of ivory beads , a strip of rabbit fur , and a second strip of fur that had been pieced together from the striped backs of several ground squirrels accentedthe diagonal hemline , and hanging from it was another fringe of the long outer guard hairs of the woolly mammoth , reaching to her lower calf . She was not wearing leggings , and her legs showed through the fringe , as well as dark brown high boots , moccasinlike at the feet , burnished to a waterproof shine . Ayla found herself wondering how they made leather shine . All of her hides and pelts had the soft natural texture of buckskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thought she was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen . " Deegie , that is beautiful . . . tunic ? " " You could call it a long tunic . It 's really a summer dress . I made it for the Meeting last year , when Branag first declared for me . I changed my mind about the outfit I was going to wear . I knew we 'd be inside , and with all the celebrating , it will get warm . " Jondalar came to join them , and it was obvious that he thought Deegie was quite attractive , too . When he smiled at her , the charisma that made him irresistibly appealing not only communicated his feelingbut somehow intensified it , and provoked the invariable response . Deegie smiled warmly and invitingly at the tall handsome man with the intense blue eyes . Talut approached them with a huge platter of food in his hand . Ayla gaped , staring . He wore a fantastic hat that stood so high on his head it brushed the ceiling . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fur , including a long , bushy squirrel tail hanging down his back , and the front ends of two relativelysmall mammoth tusks jutting straight up from both sides of his head , and joined together at the tips like the entrance archways . His tunic , which fell to his knees , was a deep maroon  --  at least the parts of it she could see were maroon . The front of it was so richly decoratedwith a complex pattern of ivory beads , animal teeth , and various shells , it was difficult to see the leather . In addition , around his neck was a heavy necklace of cave lion claws and a canine tooth , interspersed with amber , and suspended from it down his chest was an ivory plaque incised with enigmatic marks . A wide black leather belt , worn low , circled his waist and fastened in front with ties that hung down in tassels . Hanging from it by loops was a dagger , made by sharpening the tip of a mammoth tusk , and crosshatching the grip for better purchase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round , wheel-shaped object with spokelike divisions front which were suspended , by thongs , a pouch ,  |p266some  canine teeth , and most prominent , the brushy tip of a cave lion tail . A fringe of long mammoth hair that nearly swept the ground , revealed when he moved that his leggings were as ornamented as his tunic . His shiny black footwear was particularly interesting , not for its decoration , because it had none , but for its lack of any visible seam . It appeared to be a single piece of soft leather shaped exactly like his foot . It was one more of several puzzles Ayla wanted to find answers to , later . " Jondalar ! I see you 've found the two most beautiful women here ! " Talut said . " You 're right , " Jondalar said , smiling . " I would n't hesitate to wager that these two could hold their own in any company , " Talut continued . " You 've traveled , what would you say ? " " I would n't argue with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen any more beautiful than right here , " Jondalar said , looking directly at Ayla . Then he smiled at Deegie . Deegie laughed . She enjoyed the byplay , but there was no doubt where Jondalar 's heart lay . And Talut always paid her extravagant compliments ; she was his acknowledged offspring and heir , the daughter of his sister , who was the daughter of his mother . He loved the children of his hearth and provided for them , but they were Nezzie 's , and the heirs of Wymez , her brother . She had adopted Ranec , as well , since his mother was dead , which made him both the child of Wymez 's hearth and his legitimate offspring and heir , but that was an exception . All the people of the Camp welcomed the opportunity to show off their finery , and Ayla kept trying to avoid staring at one or another . Their tunics were of various lengths , with and without sleeves , and in a variety of colors , with individual decorations . The men 's tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually wore headwear of some kind . Women generally favored the V-shaped hemline , though Tulie 's was more like a belted shirt worn over leggings . It was covered , in intricate and artistic designs , with beads , shells , teeth , carved ivory and , particularly , heavy pieces of amber . Though she did n't wear a hat , her hair was so elaborately arranged and decorated , she might as well have been wearing one . But , of all , Crozie 's tunic was the most unusual . Instead of coming to a point in front , it was diagonally cut all the way across the front , with a rounded point on her right side , and a rounded cutout on her left . Most stunning , though , was its color . It was white , not off-white or ivory , but true white , and fringed and decorated with , among other things , the white feathers of the large northern crane.  |p267Even  the children were dressed for a ceremony . When Ayla saw Latie standing at the edge of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latie to come and show her outfit , in effect inviting her to join them . Latie commented on the way Ayla was wearing the beads and shells Deegie had given her , and thought she 'd try them that way . Ayla smiled . She had n't been able to think of a way to wear them , and finally just twisted them together and wrapped them around her head , across her forehead , the way she carried her sling . Latie was quickly included in the general banter , and smiled shyly when Wymez told her she looked nice  --  an extravagantcompliment from the laconic man . Once Latie joined them , Rydag was quick to follow . Ayla held him on her lap . His tunic was modeled after Talut 's , but much less ornamented . He could n't have begun to carry the weight . Talut 's ceremonial outfit weighed several times what Rydag did . Few people could have worn his headdress alone . But Ranec was slow to make an appearance . Several times Ayla noticed his absence and looked for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise . Everyone had enjoyed showing Ayla their dress-up clothing just to see her reaction ; she was so delighted and impressed and made no pretense about it . Ranec had been observing her and wanted to create an especially memorable effect , so he returned to the Fox Hearth to change . He had been watching from the Lion Hearth , and slipped up beside her while she was involved in conversation . When she turned her head , suddenly he was there , and by her amazed look , he knew he had achieved his desired effect . The cut and style of his tunic were unusual ; its tapered body and wide flaring sleeves gave it a distinctly different look and betrayed its foreign origin . It was not a Mamutoi tunic . It was one he had traded for  --  and paid dearly  --  but he knew he had to have it from the first moment he saw it . One of the northern Camps had made a trading expedition a few years before to a western people that were distantly related to the Mamutoi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutual ties and future friendly relations . He was not inclined to give it up , but Ranec had been so persistent , and finally offered him so much for it , he could n't refuse . Most of the garments worn by the people of the Lion Camp had been dyed shades of browns , deep reds , and dark yellows , and heavily decorated with light-colored ivory beads , teeth , seashells , and amber , enhanced with fur and feathers . Ranec 's tunic was a creamy ivory , nearly as light , but richer than true white , and he knew it made a stunning contrast to his dark skin , but even more stunning was the decoration . Both front and lack of the shirt had been used as a back/ground for a picture created with porcupine quills and fine cords which had been dyed strong , bright , primary colors . On the front of the shirt was an abstract portrayal of a seated woman , made out of an arrangement of concentric circles in shades of true reds , oranges , blues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly , two more were her breasts . Arcs of circles within circles indicated hips , shoulders , and arms . The head was a design based on a triangle , with a pointed chin and a flat top , with enigmatic lines instead of features on the face . In the middle of the breast and stomach circles , obviously meant to represent navel and nipples , were bright red garnets , and a line of colored stones  --  green and pink tourmalines , red garnets , aquamarines  --  had been fastened along the flat top of the head . The back of the shirt showed the same woman from the back view , with concentric circles or portions of them representingbuttocks and shoulders . The same series of colors was repeated several times around the flared ends of the sleeves . Ayla just stared , unable to speak . Even Jondalar was amazed . He had traveled far , had met many different people with many different ways of dressing , both for everyday and for ceremonial purposes . He had seen quill embroidery , and understood and admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had never seen quite so impressiveor colorful a garment before in his life . " Ayla , " Nezzie said , taking her dish from her , " Mamut wants to see you for a moment . " As she got up , everyone began to clear away food , scrape plates , and prepare for the ceremony . During the long winter ahead , a numberof feasts and ceremonies would be held to add interest and variety to a relatively inactive period  --  the Celebration of Brothers and Sisters , the Feast of the Long Night , the Laughing Contest , several festivalsand celebrations in honor of the Mother  --  but Ayla 's adoption was an unexpected occasion , and therefore all the more welcome . While people began moving toward the Mammoth Hearth , Ayla prepared the materials for fire-making , as Mamut had requested . Then she waited , suddenly feeling nervous and excited . The general ceremony had been explained to her , so she would know what to expect and what would be expected of her , but she had n't grown up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not second nature to her , and though Mamut had seemed to understand and tried to calm her fears , she worried that she might do somethinginappropriate . She was sitting on a mat near the firepit watching people . Out of the corner of her eye she saw Mamut drink something in one gulp . She noticed Jondalar sitting on their bed platform alone . I le seemedp269worried , and did n't look very happy , and she found herself wondering if she was doing the right thing to become a Mamutoi . She closed her eyes and sent a silent thought to her totem . If the Spirit of the Cave Lion had not wanted it , would he have given her a sign ? She knew the ceremony was about to begin when Talut and Tulie came and stood on either side of her , and Mamut poured cold ashes on the last small fire left burning in the lodge . Even though it had happened before , and the Camp knew what to expect , waiting in the dark for fire was an unnerving experience . Ayla felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a chorus of relieved sighs . When the fire was well established , she stood up . Both Talut and Tulie stepped forward , one on either side , each holding a long ivory shaft . Mamut stood behind Ayla . " In the name of Mut , the Great Earth Mother , we are here to welcomeAyla into the lodge of the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi , " Tulie began . " But we do more than welcome this woman into the Lion Camp . She came here as a stranger ; we wish to make her one of us , to make her Ayla of the Mamutoi . " Talut continued , " We are hunters of the great woolly mammoth , given to us by the Mother to use . The mammoth is food , is clothing , is shelter . If we honor Mut , She will cause the Spirit of the Mammoth to renew herself and return each season . If ever we dishonor the Mother , or fail to appreciate the Gift of the Spirit of the Mammoth , the mammoth will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . " The Lion Camp is like the great cave lion ; each of us walks fearlesslyand with pride . Ayla , too , walks fearlessly and with pride . I , Talut , of the Lion Hearth , headman of the Lion Camp , offer Ayla a place among the Mamutoi in the Lion Camp . " " It is a great honor she is offered . What makes her worthy ? " a voice called out from the assembled group . Ayla recognized it as Frebec 's , and was glad she had been told that it would be part of the ceremony . " By the fire you see , Ayla has proven her value . She has discovered a great mystery , a stone from which fire can be drawn , and she has offered this magic freely , to each hearth , " Tulie responded . " Ayla is a woman of many gifts , many Talents , " Talut added to the response . " By the saving of life , she has proven her value as a skilled I Icaler . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skilled hunter with a sling , and with a new weapon brought with her when she came , a spear-thrower . By the horses beyond that arch , she has proven her value as a Controller of animals . She would bring esteem to any hearth , and value to the Lion Camp . She is worthy of the Mamutoi. "  | " Who speaks for this woman ? Who will be responsible for her ? Who will offer her the kinship of Hearth ? " Tulie called out , loudly and clearly , looking at her brother . But before Talut could answer , another voice spoke out . " The Mamut speaks for Ayla ! The Mamut will be responsible ! Ayla is a daughter of the Mammoth Hearth ! " the old shaman said , his voice deeper , stronger , and more commanding than Ayla ever would have thought possible . Surprised gasps and murmured conversations could be heard from the darkened area . Everyone thought she was going to be adopted into the Lion Hearth . This was unexpected . . . or was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she wanted to be ; she did n't behave like a person familiar with the unknown and unknowable ; she was not trained to control special powers . Yet , she was a Healer . She did have extraordinary control over horses , and maybe other animals . She might be a Searcher , perhaps even a Caller . Still , the Mammoth Hearth represented the spiritual essence of those Earth 's children who called themselves the mammoth hunters . Ayla could n't even express herself completely in their language yet . How could someone who did not know their ways , and who had no knowledge of Mut , interpret the needs and wishes of the Mother for them ? " Talut was going to adopt her , Mamut , " Tulie said . " Why should she go to the Mammoth Hearth ? She has not dedicated herself to Mut , and is not trained to Serve the Mother . " " I did n't say she was trained , or that she ever will be , Tulie , though she is more gifted than you can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sake . I did not say she will be a daughter of the Mammoth Hearth . I said she is a daughter of the Mammoth Hearth . She was born to it , dedicated by the Mother Herself . Whether or not she decides to be trained is a choice only she can make , but it does n't matter in the least . Ayla does not have to dedicate herself , it is out of her hands . Trained or not , her life will Serve the Mother . I speak for her not to accept her into training , unless she wants it . I wish to adopt her as the daughter of my hearth . " As Ayla listened to the old man , she felt a sudden chill . She did n't think she liked the idea that her destiny was ordained , out of her hands , chosen for her at birth . What did he mean that she was dedicatedby the Mother , that her life would Serve the Mother ? Was she chosen by the Mother , too ? Creb had told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason why the Spirit of the Great Cave Lion had chosen her . He said she would have need of powerful protection . What did it mean to be chosen by the Mother ? Was that why she needed protection ? Or did it mean if she became Mamutoip271the Cave Lion would no longer be her totem ? No longer protect her ? It was a disquieting thought . She did n't want to lose her totem . She shook herself , trying to dispel her sense of foreboding . If Jondalar had been feeling uneasy about her adoption , this sudden turn of events made him even more uncomfortable . He heard the whispered comments of the people around him and wondered if it was true that she was meant to become one of them . She might even have been Mamutoi , before she was lost , if Mamut said she was born to the Mammoth Hearth . Ranec was overjoyed . He had wanted Ayla to become one of them , but if she was adopted to the Lion Hearth , she would be his sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to join with her , and brother and sister could not join . Since both would be adopted , and obviously did not have the same mother , he was prepared to find another hearth that would adopt him so he could pursue his suit , much as he would hate to give up his ties with Nezzie and Talut . But if she was adopted into the Mammoth Hearth , he did n't have to . He was particularly pleased that she would be adopted as the daughter of Mamut , and not as One dedicated to Serve , although even that would not have deterred him . Nezzie was a little disappointed ; she already felt as though Ayla were a daughter . But most important to Nezzie was that Ayla stay with them , and if Mamut wanted her , it would just make her all that more acceptable to the Council at the Summer Meeting . Talut glanced at her , and when she nodded , he conceded to Mamut . Tulie had no objection , either . The four of them quickly conferred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define , it pleased her to be the daughter of Mamut . As the darkened lodge quieted again , Mamut held his hand up , palm backward , facing him . " Will the woman , Ayla , step forward ? " Ayla 's stomach churned and her knees felt weak as she approached the old man . " Do you wish to be one with the Mamutoi ? " he asked . " Yes , " she whispered , her voice cracking . " Will you honor Mut , the Great Mother , revere all Her Spirits and , especially , never offend the Spirit of the Mammoth ; will you strive to be worthy of the Mamutoi , to bring honor to the Lion Camp , and always respect Mamut and the meaning of the Mammoth Hearth ? " " Yes . " She could hardly say more . She was n't sure what she was supposed to do to accomplish all of it , but she would certainly try . " Does this Camp accept this woman ? " Mamut said to the assembly . " We accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any here that reject her ? "  |p272There  was a long pause , and Ayla was n't at all sure that Frebec would n't speak out in objection , but none replied . " Talut , headman of the Lion Camp , will you inscribe the mark ? " Mamut intoned . As Ayla saw Talut withdraw his knife from the sheath , her heart beat fast . This was unexpected . She did n't know what he was going to do with the knife , but whatever it was , she was sure she would n't like it . The big headman took Ayla 's arm , pushed up her sleeve , and poised the flint knife , then quickly cut a straight mark on her upper arm , drawing blood . Ayla felt the pain , but she did n't flinch . With the blood still wet on the knife , Talut incised a straight mark on the piece of ivory hanging as a plaque around his neck , held by Mamut , making a red-stained gouge . Then Mamut said some words Ayla did not understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ayla is now counted among the people of the Lion Camp , numberedamong the Mammoth Hunters , " Talut said . " This woman is and will forever be Ayla of the Mamutoi . " Mamut picked up a small bowl and poured stinging liquid on the cut on her arm  --  she realized it was an antiseptic cleansing solution  --  then he turned her around to face the group . " Welcome Ayla of the Mamutoi , member of the Lion Camp , daughter of the Mammoth Hearth . " He paused for a moment , then added , " Chosen of the Spirit of the Great Cave Lion . " The group repeated the words , and Ayla realized it was the second time in her life that she had been taken in , accepted , and made a member of a people whose ways she hardly knew . She closed her eyes , hearing the words echo in her mind . Then it struck her . Mamut had included her totem ! Even though she was not Ayla of the Clan , she had not lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cave Lion . But even more , she was not Ayla of No People ; she was Ayla of the Mamutoi !  |p273You  may always claim the sanctuary of the Mammoth Hearth , Ayla , wherever you are . Please accept this token , daughter of my hearth , " Mamut said as he removed a circlet of ivory carved with zigzag lines from his arm and tied the pierced ends together on Ayla 's arm , just below her cut . Then he gave her a warm embrace . Ayla had tears in her eyes when she went to the bed platform where her gifts were laid out , but she wiped them away before she picked up a wooden bowl . It was round , strong , but of uniformly fine thinness . The bowl boasted neither painted nor carved design , only a subtle pattern of the wood grain , but that was symmetrically balanced . " Please accept gift of medicine bowl from daughter of hearth , Mamut , " Ayla said . " And if you allow , daughter of hearth will fill bowl every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and knees . " " Ah , I would welcome some relief from my arthritis this winter , " he said with a smile , taking the bowl and passing it to Talut , who looked it over , nodded , and passed it to Tulie . Tulie examined it critically , at first judging it to be simplistic because it lacked the additional design , either carved or painted , that she was accustomed to . But as she looked more closely , running her fingertipsover the remarkably smooth finish , noting the perfect shape and symmetry , she had to concede that it was certainly a finely crafted piece of work , perhaps the finest piece of workmanship of its kind she had ever seen . As the bowl was passed around , it aroused the interest and curiosity about the other gifts Ayla had brought even more as each person wondered if every gift would be as beautifully unusual . " I'alut came forward next and gave Ayla a big hug , then presented her with an ivory-handled flint knife in a red-dyed rawhide sheath which was carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore on her belt . Ayla took the knife out of the sheath , and immediatelyguessed that the blade had probably been made by Wymez , and suspected that ILtnec had carved and shaped the handle . Ayla brought out a heavy pile of dark fur for Talut . I le grinnedp274wide when he shook out the mantle made from an entire bison hide , and flung it over his shoulders . The thick mane and shoulder fur made the big man seem even bigger than he was , and he enjoyed the effect . Then he noticed the way it clung to his shoulders and hung down in pliant folds , and examined the soft and supple inside of the warm cloak more closely . " Nezzie ! Look at this , " he said . " Have you ever seen softer hide on a bison pelt ? And this is warm . I do n't think I want this made into anything , not even a parka ! I 'm going to wear it just as it is . " Ayla smiled at his delight , pleased that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking over several heads that were crowding in closer , enjoying Talut 's reaction , too . He 'd anticipated it , but was glad to see his expectations borne out . Nezzie gave Ayla a warm hug , and then a necklace of matched and graduated spiral shells , each one separated by carefully sawed small sections of the hard hollow leg bones of arctic fox and , suspended as a pendant in front , a large canine tooth of a cave lion . Ayla held it on while Tronie tied it in back , then she looked down and admired it , holding up the cave lion tooth , and wondering how they had managed to pierce the hole through the root . Ayla pushed the drape in front of the platform aside and brought out a very large covered basket , and set it down at Nezzie 's feet . It seemed quite plain . None of the grasses out of which it was made had been dyed , and no colored patterns of geometric designs or stylized figures of birds or animals graced the sides or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtle design , and saw how expertlyit was made . It was watertight enough to be a cooking basket , she knew . Nezzie lifted the cover to examine it , and the whole camp voiced its surprise . The basket , divided into sections by flexible birchbark , was full of food . There were small hard apples , sweet and spicy wild carrots , peeled , gnarled roots of starchy groundnuts , pitted dried cherries , dried but still green day-lily buds , round green milk vetch dried in the pod , dried mushrooms , dried stalks of green onions , and some unidentifiable dried leaves and slices . Nezzie smiled warmly at her as she examined the selection . It was a perfect gift . Tulie approached next . Her embrace of welcome was not lacking in warmth , but more formal , and her presentation of her gift to Ayla , while not exactly done with a flourish , demonstrated a proper sense of ceremony . The gift was a small container , exquisitely decorated . It had been carved out of wood into the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish were both carved and painted on it , and pieces of shell glued on it as well . The overall design gave thep275impression of water alive with fish and underwater plants . When Ayla lifted the lid , she discovered the purpose of so precious a box . It was filled with salt . She had some idea of the value of salt . When she grew up with the Clan , who lived near Beran Sea , she had taken salt for granted . It was fairly easy to obtain , and some of the fish were even cured with it , but inland , when she lived in her valley , she had had no salt , and it had taken some time to get used to it . The Lion Camp was farther away from the sea than her valley . The salt , as well as the seashells , had to be transported over a long distance , yet Tulie had given her this whole box of it . It was a rare and costly gift . Ayla felt properly awed as she brought out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been right in his suggestion of what would be appropriate . The fur she had selected was the pelt of a snow leopard , one that had attempted to snatch a kill away from her the winter she and Baby were learning to hunt together . She had just planned to scare it off , but the adolescent cave lion had other ideas . Ayla had stunned the mature , though smaller , cat with a stone from her sling when it looked like a fight would ensue , and then finishedit off with another . The gift was obviously unexpected , and Tulie 's eyes showed her pleasure , but it was n't until she succumbed to the temptation to throw the luxurious , thick winter fur around her shoulders that she noticed its unique quality , the same quality Talut had remarked upon . It felt unbelievably soft on the inner side . Furs were usually stiffer than hides . By its nature , fur could only be worked on one side with the scrapers used to stretch and soften . While it made a longer-lasting , sturdier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , the Mamutoi method of preserving skins made the leather less soft and pliable . Tulie was more impressed than she had expected to be , and decided she would find out what Ayla 's method was . Wymez approached with an object wrapped in a soft skin . She opened it , and caught her breath . It was a magnificent spear point , like the ones she had so admired . It sparkled in the firelight like a faceted gem , and was more valuable . Her gift to him was a sturdy grass floor mat for him to sit on when he worked . Most of Ayla 's gasket and mat weaving had no colored designs , but the last winter in her cave she had begun to experiment with different grasses that had natural color variations . The result , in combination with her usual weaving patterns , was a mat with a subtle but distinctive starburst pattern . She had been quite pleased when she made it , and when she was selecting gifts , its pointed rays extending out from the center remindedher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small ridges of fine slivers he flaked off . She wondered if he would notice . After he examined it , he gave her one of his rare smiles . " This is beautiful . It reminds me of the work done by Ranec 's mother . She understood weaving with grasses better than anyone I ever knew . I suppose I should save it , hang it on the wall , but I will use it instead . I will sit on this when I work . It will help me keep my purpose in mind . " His welcoming hug had none of the reticence of his verbal manner . She realized that beneath his quiet exterior Wymez was a man of friendly warmth and perceptive feeling . There was no special sequence or order to the gift giving , and the next person Ayla noticed , standing near the platform waiting to get her attention , was Rydag . She sat down near him , and returned his fierce hug . Then he opened his hand and held out a long round tube , the hollow leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She took it from the boy , and turned it around in her hands , not sure of its purpose . He took it back , held it to his mouth , and blew . The whistle emitted a loud , piercing sound . Ayla tried it and smiled . Then she gave him a warm , waterproof wolverine hood made in the style of the Clan , but she felt a wrenching pain when he put it on . He reminded her too much of Durc . " I gave him a whistle like that to call me if he needs me . Sometimes he does n't have breath enough to yell , but enough to blow a whistle , " Nezzie explained , " but he made that one himself . " Deegie surprised her with the outfit she had planned to wear that evening . When she saw the look in Ayla 's eyes at the sight of it , Deegie decided to give it to her . Ayla was beyond words , and just stared at it until her eyes filled with tears . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She gave Deegie her gift then , a stack of baskets and several beautifullyfinished wooden bowls of various sizes , which could be used as drinking cups or for soups , or even to cook in , for her to use at her hearth after she joined with Branag . In a region where wood was relatively rare , and bone and ivory more commonly used for utensils , the bowls were a special gift . They were both delighted , and hugged with the warmth of sisters . To show that he did not begrudge her a decent gift , Frebec gave her a pair of knee-high fur boots , decorated and quilled near the top , and she was glad she had selected some of her best summer reindeer pelts for him . The hair of the reindeer was hollow , a minute air-filled tube , and naturally insulating . The summer hide was both the warmestand the lightest weight , the most practical and comfortable to wear during cold weather hunting of any animal 's fur , and therefore thep277most valuable . From the pieces she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be made that would be so warm only a single additional outer garment would be needed even during the coldest weather , freeing him from bulky weight . He noticed the softness of her finished skins as the others had , but he did not remark on it and his hug of welcome was stiff . Fralie gave her fur mittens to match the boots , and Ayla gave the pregnant woman a beautiful wooden cooking bowl , filled with a pouch of dried leaves . " I hope you like this tea , Fralie , " she said , giving her a direct stare , as though to emphasize her words . " Is good to drink cup in morning when first wake up , and maybe another at night , before sleep . If you like , I will give more when this gone . " Fralie nodded agreement as they embraced . Frebec looked at them suspiciously , but Ayla was only giving a gift , and he could hardly complain about Fralie 's gift from the newest member of the Lion Camp , could he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have preferred to treat Fralie directly and openly , but the subterfuge was better than not helping her at all , and Fralie refused to be put into a situation where it might seem that she was making a choice between her mother and her mate . Crozie came forward next and nodded approvingly at Ayla . Then she gave her a small leather bag , sewn together around the sides and gathered at the top . The pouch was dyed red , beautifully decorated with small ivory beads , and embroidered in white with downward pointing triangles . Small white crane feathers were arrayed around the circular bottom edge . Ayla admired it , but when she made no move to do so , Deegie told her to open it . Inside were cords and threads made of mammoth wool , sinew , animal fur , and plant fibers , all carefully wound into circles or around small phalanges of bone . The sewing sack also contained sharp blades and awls for cutting and piercing . Ayla was delighted . She wanted to learn the Mamutoi ways of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small wooden bowl with a close-fittinglid and gave it to the old woman . When Crozie opened it , she looked at Ayla with a puzzled expression . It was filled with pure white marbleized softened tallow  --  tasteless , colorless , odorless animal fat that had been rendered in simmering water . She smelled it , and smiled , but was still puzzled . " I make rose water , from petals . . . mix with . . . other things , " Ayla started to explain . " That 's what makes it smell nice , I suppose , but what is it for ? " Crozie asked . " Is for hands , for face , elbows , feet . Feel good . Make smooth , "  |p278Ayla  said , taking a small dab and rubbing it on the back of the woman 's dry , chapped , wrinkled old hand . After it was rubbed in , Crozie touched her hand , then closed her eyes , and slowly felt the smoother skin . When the old harridan opened her eyes , Ayla thought they glistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the woman gave her a hard hug of welcome , Ayla felt her shaking underneath . Each gift exchanged made everyone anticipate the next one more , and Ayla was enjoying the giving as much as the receiving . Her gifts were as unusual to them as theirs were to her , and it was as much fun to see her gifts well received as it was to feel overwhelmed by the gifts presented to her . She had never felt so special , had never been made to feel so welcome , so wanted . If she let herself think about it , tears of joy threatened . Ranec was hanging back , waiting until all the other gifts were exchanged . He wanted to be last so his gift would not be confused with all the others . Among all the special and unique gifts she had received , he wanted his to be most memorable . Ayla was putting her things away on the platform that was just as full as when she began , when she saw the gift she had chosen for Ranec . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't exchanged gifts with him yet . With it in her hands , she turned around to look for him , only to find herself looking into the teeth of his teasing smile . " Did you forget one for me ? " he said . He was standing so close she could see large black pupils and , for the first time , converging faint streaks of light within the dark brown of his eyes  --  his deep , liquid , compelling dark eyes . She felt a warmth emanating from him that disconcerted her . " No , ah . . . did not forget . . . . Here , " she said , remembering the gift was in her hands and holding it up . He glanced down and his eyes showed his pleasure at the thick , lush , winter-white pelts of arctic foxes she held out to him . The moment of hesitation gave her the chance to compose herself , and when he looked back at her , her eyes held a teasing smile . " I think you forget . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch on and play along with his joking as because it gave him an appropriate opening to present his gift . " No . I did not forget . Here , " he said , and brought out the object he had been hiding behind his back . She looked at the piece of carved ivory cradled in his hands , and almost did n't believe what she saw . And even when he relieved her of the white furs she held in her hands , she did n't reach for it . She was almost afraid to touch it . She looked up at him with sheer wonder.  | " Ranec , " she breathed , reaching , then hesitating . He had to urge it on her , and then she held it as though it might break . " This is Whinney ! Is like you take Whinney and make small , " she exclaimed , turningthe exquisite , carved ivory horse , no more than three inches in length , over in her hands . A touch of color had been applied to the sculpture : yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs , the stiff mane and along the spine to the tail to match Whinney 's coloring . " Look , little ears , just right . And hooves , and tail . Even markings like her coat . Oh , Ranec , how you do it ? " Ranec could n't have been happier as he gave her a warm embrace of welcome . Her reaction was exactly what he had been hoping for , even dreaming of , and the look of love in his eyes when he watched her was so obvious , it brought tears to Nezzie 's eyes . She glanced at Jondalarand knew he saw it , too . Anguish was etched on his face . She shook her head knowingly . After all the gifts were exchanged , Ayla went with Deegie to the Aurochs Hearth to change into the new outfit . Ever since Ranec had acquired the foreign shirt , Deegie had been trying to match the color . She had finally come close , and from the cream-colored leather she had made a short-sleeved V-neck tunic with a V-shaped hemline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bright colors similarto the colors of the designs on the shirt . The summer spent outsideleft Ayla 's skin deeply tanned , and her blond hair lightened , almost the color of the leather . The outfit suited her as though it had been made especially for her . With Deegie 's help , Ayla put back Mamut 's ivory armband , then added Talut 's red-sheathed knife , and the necklace from Nezzie , but when the young Mamutoi woman suggested that she remove the worn , dirt-stained , lumpy leather pouch from around her neck , Ayla adamantly refused . " Is my amulet , Deegie . Holds Spirit of Cave Lion , of Clan , of me . Little pieces , like Ranec 's carving is little Whinney . Creb told me , if I lose amulet , totem can not find me . I will die , " Ayla tried to explain . Deegie thought for a moment , looking at Ayla . The whole effect was spoiled by the grubby little leather bag . Even the thong around her neck was frayed , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do when it wears out ? That thong looks like it will break soon , " Deegie asked . " I make new bag , new thong . " " Then , it 's not the bag that is so important , but what 's inside it , right ? " " Yes . . Deegie looked around and suddenly spotted the sewing sack Croziep280had given Ayla . She picked it up , emptied the contents carefully onto a platform , and held it out to her . " Is there any reason you ca n't use this ? We can fasten it to a string of beads  --  one from your hair will be fine  --  and you can wear it around your neck . " Ayla took the beautiful , decorated bag from Deegie , looked at it , then wrapped her hand around the familiar old leather pouch and felt the sense of comfort the Clan amulet gave her . But she was n't Clan any more . She had n't lost her totem . The Spirit of the Cave Lion still protected her , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was Mamutoi now . When Ayla went back to the Mammoth Hearth , she was every inch a Mamutoi woman , a beautiful , well-dressed Mamutoi woman of high status and obvious value , and every eye had approving looks for the newest member of the Lion Camp . But two sets of eyes showed more than approval . Love and longing gleamed from dark laughing eyes full of eager hope no less than from the miserably unhappy eyes of an impossibly vivid shade of blue . Manuv , with Nuvie on his lap , smiled warmly at Ayla as she passed by on her way to put her other clothes away , and she beamed back , so full of joy and happiness she did n't think she could contain it all . She was Ayla of the Mamutoi , and she was going to do everything she could to be completely one of them . Then she saw Jondalar talking to Danug , only from the back , but felt her elation collapse . Perhapsit was his stance , or the way he held his shoulders , but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happy . But what could she do about it now ? She hurried to get the firestones . Mamut had told her to wait until later before giving them away . Appropriate ceremony would invest the stones with proper significance , and enhance their value . She picked up the small , yellow-gray metallic-colored nodules of iron pyrite and brought them with her to the hearth . On her way , she passed behind Tulie , who was talking to Nezzie and Wymez , and overheard her speaking. " ... but I had no idea she had so much wealth . Just look at the furs alone . The bison hide , and the white fox pelts , and this snow leopard  --  youdo n't see many of these around . . . " Ayla smiled as her feeling of joy returned . Her gifts had been ac ceptable , and appreciated . The old man of mystery had not been idle . While she was changing , Mamut was changing , too . His face was painted with zigzag lines that accented and enhanced his tattoo , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same cave lion whose tail Talut sported . Mamut 's necklace was made of short hollowed-out sections of the tusk of ap281small mammoth interspersed with canine teeth of several different animals , including one of a cave lion that matched hers . " Talut is planning a hunt , so I will Search , " the shaman told her . " Join me , if you can  --  and want to . In any case , be prepared . " Ayla nodded , but her stomach churned . Tulie came toward the hearth and smiled at her . " I did n't know Deegie was going to give that to you , " she said . " I 'm not sure if I would have approved earlier ; she worked hard on it , but I must admit it becomes you , Ayla . " Ayla just smiled , not sure how to respond . " That 's why I gave it to her , Mother , " Deegie said , approaching with her skull instrument . " I was trying to work out the process of getting finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make anotheroutfit . " " I 'm ready , " Tornec announced as he arrived with his mammoth bone instrument . " Good . You can start as soon as Ayla starts handing out the stones , " Mamut said . " Where 's Talut ? " " He 's been pouring his brew , " Tornec said , smiling , " and he 's being very generous . He said he wants this to be a suitable celebration . " " And it will be , too ! " the big headman said . " Here Ayla , I brought you a cup . After all , you are the reason for this occasion ! " Ayla tasted the drink , still finding the fermented flavor not entirely to her taste , but all the rest of the Mamutoi seemed to enjoy it . She decided she would learn to enjoy it , too . She wanted to be one of them , to do what they did , to like what they liked . She drank it down . Talut filled her cup again . " Talut will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strike each one and get a spark just before you give it , " Mamut instructed . She nodded , looked at the cup in her hand , then drank the contents , shaking her head at the potent beverage , and put the cup down to pick up the stones . " Ayla is now counted among the Lion Camp , " Talut said , as soon as everyone settled down , " but she has one more gift . For each hearth , a stone to make fire . Nezzie is the keeper of the Lion Hearth . Ayla will give the firestone to her to keep . " As Ayla walked toward Nezzie , she struck the iron pyrite with flint , drawing a bright spark , then she gave her the stone . " Who is the keeper of the Fox Hearth ? " Talut continued as Deegie and Tornec began beating on the bone instruments . " I am . Ranec is the keeper of the Fox Hearth . " Avia brought him a stone , and struck it . But when she gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " The fox furs are softer and more beautiful than any I have ever seen . I will keep them on my bed and think of you every night when I feel their softness against my bare skin . " He touched her face , only lightly , with the back of his hand , but she felt it as a physical shock . She backed away , confused , as Talut asked for the keeper of the Reindeer Hearth , and had to strike the stone twice to get a spark for Tronie . Fralie took the stone for the Crane Hearth , and by the time Tulie took hers , and she gave one to Mamut , for the Mammoth Hearth , Ayla was feeling dizzy , and more than willing to sit down near the fire where Mamut indicated . The drums began to have their effect . The sound was soothing and compelling at the same time . The lodge was darkened  --  a small fire diffused through the screen was the only light . She could hear breathing , close by , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the fire , was a man  --  or was it a lion ? The breathing became a low growl , almost , but not quite  --  to her perceptive ear  --  like the warning growl of a cave lion . The vocalized drumming picked up the sound , giving it resonance and depth . Suddenly , with a savage snarl , the lion figure leaped , and the silhouetteof a lion moved across the screen . But it almost jerked to a stop in a startled response to Ayla 's unintentional reaction . She challengedthe shadow lion with a growl so realistic and so menacing it brought a gasp from most of the people watching . The silhouette recoveredits lion stance and answered with the soothing growl of a lion backing down . Ayla voiced an angry snarl of victory , then began a series of " hnk , hnk , hnk " grunts that faded as though the lion were walking away . Mamut smiled to himself . Her lion is so perfect it would fool a lion , he thought , pleased that she had spontaneously joined him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that after her first impromptuchallenge , it was fun to talk like a lion with Mamut . She had n't done anything like it since Baby left her valley . The drums had picked up and enhanced the scene , but now were following the silhouettemoving sinuously across the screen . She was close enough to see that it was Mamut creating the action , but even she became caught up in the effect . She wondered , though , how the normally stiff and arthritic old man could move with such ease . Then she remembered seeing him gulp something down earlier , and suspected it might have been a strong painkiller . He would probably suffer for this the next day . Suddenly Mamut leaped out from behind the screen and squatted by his mammoth skull drum . Ile beat on it rapidly for a short time , then stopped suddenly . I le picked up a cup Ay la had n't noticed be/fore , drank from it , then approaching her , offered it . Without even thinking about it , she took a small sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , musky , and unpleasant . Encouraged by the talking drums , she soon began to feel the effects . The leaping flames behind the screen gave the animals painted on it a feeling of movement . She was entranced by them , concentrated her entire attention on them , and heard only in the distance the voices of the Camp beginning to chant . A baby cried , but it seemed to come from some other world as she was drawn along by the strange flickeringmotion of the animals on the screen . They seemed almost alive , as the drum music filled her with pounding hooves , bawling calves , trumpeting mammoths . Then , it was dark no longer . Instead , a hazy sun overlooked a snowy plain . A small herd of musk-oxen was huddled together , a blizzardswirling around them . As she swooped low , she sensed she was not alone . Mamut was with her . The scene shifted . The storm was over , but wind-driven whirling snow-devils wailed across the steppes like ghostly apparitions . She and Mamut moved away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing stoically on the lee side of a narrow valley , trying to stay out of the wind . She was racing ahead , darting along the river valley that cut deep ravines . They followed a tributary that narrowed into a steep-walled canyon ahead , and she saw the familiar side path up the dry bed of a seasonal stream . And then she was in a dark place looking down at a small fire and people huddled around a screen . She heard a slow chant , a continuous repetition of sound . When she flickered her eyelids and saw blurred faces , she saw Nezzie and Talut and Jondalar looking down at her with worried expressions . " Are you all right ? " Jondalar asked , speaking Zelandonii . " Yes , yes . I 'm all right , Jondalar . What happened ? Where was I ? " " You 'll have to tell me . " " How do you feel ? " Nezzie asked . " Mamut always likes this tea , afterward . " " I am fine , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . A little tired , and a little dizzy , but not bad . " I do n't think it was as frightening for you this time , Ayla , " Mamut said , coming toward her . Ayla smiled . " No , I am not frightened , but what we do ? " " We Searched . I thought you were a Searcher . That 's why you are a daughter of the Mammoth Hearth , " he said . " You have other naturalTalents , Ayla , but you need training . " He saw her frown . " Do n't worry about it now . There is time to think about it later . " Talut poured out more of his brew for Avla and several othersp284while Mamut told them about the Search , where they went , what they found . She gulped it down  --  it did n't seem so bad that way  --  then tried to listen , but it seemed to go to her head quickly . Her mind wandered and she noticed that Deegie and Tornec were still playing their instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her want to move with them . It reminded her of the Women 's Dance of the Clan , and she found it hard to concentrate on Mamut . She felt someone watching her , and glanced around . Near the Fox Hearth she saw Ranec staring at her . He smiled and she smiled back . Suddenly Talut was filling her cup again . Ranec came forward and offered his cup for filling ; Talut complied , then turned back to the discussion . " You 're not interested in this , are you ? Let 's go over there , where Deegie and Tornec are playing , " Ranec said in a low voice , leaning close to her ear . " I think not . They talk about hunt . " Ayla turned back to the seriousdiscussion , but she had missed so much of it she did n't know where they were , and they did n't seem to notice if she was listening or not . " You wo n't miss anything . They 'll tell us all about it later . Listen to that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsing musical sounds coming from the other side of the hearth . " Would n't you rather see how Tornec does that ? He 's really very good . " Ayla leaned toward the sound , pulled by the rhythmic beat . She glanced at the group making plans , then looked at Ranec and broke into a full beaming smile . " Yes , I rather see Tornec ! " she said , feeling pleased with herself . As they got up , Ranec , standing close , stopped her . " You must stop smiling , Ayla , " he said , his tone serious and stern . " Why ? " she asked with deep concern , her smile gone , wondering what she had done wrong . " Because you are so lovely when you smile , you take my breath away , " Ranec said , and he meant every word , but then he continued , " And how will I walk with you if I 'm gasping for breath ? " Ayla 's smile returned at his compliment , then the idea of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a joke , of course , she thought , though she was n't entirely sure he was joking . They walked toward the new entrance to the Mammoth Hearth . Jondalar observed them as they approached . He had been enjoying the rhythms and music while he was waiting for her , but he did not enjoy seeing Ayla walking toward the music makers with Ranec . He felt jealousy rise in his throat , and had a wild urge to strike out at the man who dared to advance on the woman he loved . But Ranec , for allp285that he looked different , was Mamutoi , and belonged to the Lion Camp . Jondalar was only a guest . They would stand up for their own , and he was alone . He tried to exert control and reason . Ranec and Ayla were only walking together . How could he object to that ? He had had mixed feelings about her adoption from the beginning . He wanted her to belong to some group of people , because she wanted it , and , he admitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen how happy she was when they were exchanging gifts , and he was pleased for her , but felt distant from it , and more worried than ever that she might not want to leave . He wondered if he should have allowed himself to be adopted after all . He had felt a part of Ayla 's adoption in the beginning . But he felt like an outsider now , even to Ayla . She was one of them . This was her night , her celebration , hers and the Lion Camp 's . He had given her no gift , and had not received one in exchange . He had n't even thought of it , though now he wished he had . But he had no gifts to give , to her or anyone . He had arrived here with nothing , and he had not spent years making and accumulating things . He had learned many things in his travels and had accumulated knowledge , but he 'd had no opportunity to benefit from his acquisitions , yet . All he had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jondalar watched her smiling and laughing with Ranec , feeling like an unwanted intruder.  |p286When  the discussion broke up , Talut doled out more of his fermented beverage , made from the starch of cattail roots and various other ingredients , which he was constantly experimenting with . The festivities centered on Deegie and Tornec became more lively . They played music , people sang , sometimes together and other times individually . Some people danced , not the energetic kind of dance Ayla had seen earlier , outside , but a subtle form of body movement made standing in one place in time to the rhythm , often with a singing accompaniment . Ayla noticed Jondalar often , hanging back somewhat , and started toward him several times , but something always interrupted . There were so many people , and all of them seemed to be vying for her attention . She was not entirely in control of herself from Talut 's drink , and her concentration was easily distracted . She took a turn on Deegie 's musical skull drum , with enthusiastic encouragement , and remembered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , to the Lion Camp , unusual and intriguing . If Mamut had any doubts left about Ayla 's origins , the memories triggered by her playing eliminated them completely . Then Ranec stood up to dance and sing a humorous song full of innuendo and double meanings about the Pleasures of Gifts , directed at Ayla . It brought broad grins and knowing glances , and was obvious enough to make Ayla blush . Deegie showed her how to dance and sing the satirical response , but at the end , where a hint of acceptance or rejection was supposed to finish it , Ayla stopped . She could do neither . She did n't quite understand the subtleties of the game , and while it was n't her intention to encourage him , she did n't want him to think she did n't like him , either . Ranec smiled . Disguised as humor , the song was often used as a face-saving means of discovering if interestwas mutual . Not even a flat rejection would have stopped him ; he considered anything less , promising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attention . Everyone wanted to include her , everyone wanted to talk to her , to listen to her , to put an arm around her and feel close . She couldn'tp287remember ever having so much fun , or feeling so warm and friendly , or so wanted . And every time she turned around , she saw an enraptured , gleaming smile and flashing dark eyes concentrated on her . As the evening wore on , the group began to diminish . Children dropped off to sleep and were carried to their beds . Fralie had gone to bed early , at Ayla 's suggestion , and the rest of Crane Hearth followed soon after . Tronie , complaining of a headache  --  she had n't been feelingwell that evening  --  went to her hearth to nurse Hartal , and fell asleep . Jondalar slipped away then , too . He stretched out on the sleeping platform , waiting for Ayla , and watching her . Wymez was uncommonly voluble , after a few cups of Talut 's bouza , and told stories and made teasing remarks first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women . Tulie began to find him suddenly interesting , after all this time , and teased and joked back . She ended up inviting him to spend the night at the Aurochs Hearth with her and Barzec . She had n't shared her bed with a second man since Darnev died . Wymez decided it might be a good idea to leave the hearth to Ranec , and perhaps not so unwise to let it be known that a woman could choose two men . He was not blind to the situation that was developing , though he doubted that any agreement could be reached between Ranec and Jondalar . But the big woman did seem particularlyattractive this evening , and she was a highly valued headwoman who had a great deal of status to bestow . Who could tell what changes he might want to make if Ranec decided to change the composition of the Fox Hearth ? Not long after the three of them headed toward the back of the lodge , Talut teased Nezzie to the Lion Hearth . Deegie and Tornec got involved in experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ayla thought she heard some of her rhythms . Then she realized she and Ranec were talking alone , and it made her self-conscious . " I think everyone go to bed , " she said , her voice a little slurred . She was feeling the effects of the bouza , and weaved back and forth where she stood . Most of the lamps were gone , and the fire had burned low . " Perhaps we should , " he said , smiling . Ayla felt the unspoken invitationgleaming in his eyes , and was drawn to it , but she did n't know how to deal with it . " Yes . I am tired , " she said , starting toward her bed platform . Ranec took her hand and held her back . " Ayla , do n't go . " His smile was gone , and his tone was insistent . She turned back , and the next instant , his arms were around her , and his nwuth was hard on hers . She opened hers slightly , and his re/sponse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her neck , her throat . His hands reached for her breasts , then caressed her hips , and her thighs , and cupped her mound , as though he could n't get enough of her and wanted her all at once . Unexpected shocks of excitementcoursed through her . He pressed her to him , and she felt a hard hot lump against her , and a sudden warmth of her own between her legs . " Ayla , I want you . Come to my bed , " he said with commanding urgency . With unexpected complaisance , she followed him . All evening , Jondalar had watched the woman he loved laughing and joking and dancing with her new people , and the longer he watched , the more of an outsider he felt . But it was the attentive darkskinnedcarver , in particular , that galled him . He wanted to vent his wrath , step in and take Ayla away , but this was her home now , this was the night of her adoption . What right did he have to interfere in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance , if not pleasure , but he felt miserable , and went to the bed platform wishing for the oblivion of sleep that would not come . From the dark enclosed space , Jondalar watched Ranec embrace Ayla and lead her away toward his bed , and felt a shock of disbelief . How could she be going with another man when he was waiting for her ? No woman had ever chosen someone else when he wanted her , and this was the woman he loved ! He wanted to jump up , grab her away , and smash his fist into that smiling mouth . Then he imagined broken teeth and blood , and remembered the agony of shame and exile . These were not even his people . They would surely turn him out , and in the freezing cold night of the periglacialsteppes there was no place to go . And how could he go anyplacewithout his Ayla ? But she had made the choice . She had chosen Ranec , and it was her right to choose anyone she wanted . Just because Jondalar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had n't . She chose a man of her own people , a Mamutoi man who sang and danced and flirted with her , and with whom she had laughed and had fun . Could he blame her ? How many times had he chosen someone with whom he had laughed and had fun ? But how could she do it ? This was the woman he loved ! How could she choose someone else when he loved her ? Jondalar anguished and despaired , but what could he do ? Nothing but swallow his bitter gorge of jealousy , and watch the woman he loved follow another man to his bed.  |p289Ayla  was n't thinking clearly , her mind was muddled from Talut 's brew , and there was no question that she was attracted to Ranec , but those were n't the reasons she went with him . She would have gone no matter what . Ayla was brought up by the Clan . She was taught to comply , without question , with any man who commanded her , who gave her the signal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Clan gave the signal to any woman , she was expected to render the service , just as she would bring him food or water . Though it was deemed a courtesy to request a woman 's servicesof her mate , or the man she was usually associated with , first , it was not required , and would have been given as a matter of course . A man 's mate was his to command , but not exclusively . The bond between a woman and a man was mutually beneficial , companionate and often , after a time , affectionate , but to show jealousy , or any strong emotion , was unthinkable . It did n't make a man 's mate any less his because she rendered a small service to someone else ; and he did n't love the children of his mate any less . He assumed a certain responsibility for them , in terms of care and training , but his hunting provided for his clan , and all food , gathered and hunted , was shared . Ranec had given Ayla what she had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a command to satisfy his sexual needs . Like any properly raised woman of the Clan , it did n't even occur to her to refuse . She looked toward her bed platform once , but did not see the blue eyes full of shock and pain . It would have surprised her if she had . Ranec 's ardor had not cooled by the time they walked to the Fox Hearth , but he was more controlled once Ayla was within its boundaries , though he could hardly believe it . They sat down on his bed platform . She noticed the white furs she had given him . She started to untie her belt , but Ranec stopped her . " I want to undress you , Ayla . I 've dreamed of this , and I want it to he just right , " Ranec said . She shrugged , agreeably . She had already noticed that Ranec was different from Jondalar in certain ways , and it made her curious . It was n't a matter of judging which man was better , just noting differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are so beautiful , " he said , finally , as he leaned over to kiss her . His mouth was soft , though it could be hard when he kissed her hard . She noticed his dark hand outlined by the white fur , and rubbed his arm gently . His skin felt the same as any other skin . He started by taking off the beads and shells she had in her hair , then he ran his hands through it , and brought it to his face to feel andp290smell . " Beautiful , so beautiful , " he murmured . He unfastened her necklace , and then her new amulet bag , and put them carefully beside her beads on the storage bench near the head of the bed . Then he untied her belt , stood up , and pulled her up beside him . Suddenly , he was kissing her face and her throat again , and feeling her body underneathher tunic , as though he could n't wait . Ayla felt his excitement . His fingertips brushing her nipple sent a current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up to him . He stopped then , and taking a deep breath , lifted the tunic up over her head , and folded it neatly beside her other things . Then he just looked at her , as though he was trying to memorize her . He turned her one way , and then another , filling his eyes as though they , too , needed satisfaction . " Perfect , just perfect . Look at them , full , yet shapely , just right , " he said , running a fingertip lightly along the profile of her breast . She closed her eyes and shivered from the tender touch . Suddenly a warm mouth was sucking on a nipple , and she felt a shock deep inside . " Perfect , so perfect , " he whispered , changing to the other breast . He pressed his face between them , then with both hands held them togetherand suckled both nipples at once , making little grunting noises of pleasure . She arched her neck back and pressed toward him , feeling twin surges of sensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so full and tightly curled , let her hands enjoy the new experience . They were still standing when he backed away and looked at her , a smile on his face , while he untied the waist cord and lowered her leggings . He could n't resist feeling the texture of her curly blond hair , and cupping her mound to touch her warm moistness , then he sat her down . He quickly removed his own shirt , and put it beside hers , then he kneeled in front of her and removed one moccasin-type indoor shoe . " Are you ticklish ? " he asked . " Little , on bottom . " " How does this feel ? " He rubbed her foot , gently but firmly , applyingpressure on the instep . " Feel good . " Then he kissed her instep . " Feel good , " she said again , with a smile . He smiled back , then took off her other shoe , and rubbed her foot . He pulled the leggings off , and put them and the shoes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up again so she stood naked in the last light of the dying coals from the Mammoth Hearth . He turned her again , from front to back , looking at her . " 0 Mother ! So beautiful , so perfect . Just like I knew you would be , " he crooned , nwrc to himself than to her.  | " Ranec , I am not beautiful , " she chided . " You should see yourself , Ayla . Then you would not say that . " " It is nice you say , nice you think , but I am not beautiful , " Ayla insisted . " You are lovelier than anyone I 've ever seen . " She only nodded . He could think so , if he wanted . She could n't stop him . After filling his eyes , he began to touch , first lightly , all over , outliningher with his fingertips from different angles . Then in finer detail , he traced the muscle structure under her skin . Suddenly he stopped and peeled the rest of his clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his arms , wanting to feel her body with his . She felt him as well , his warm compact muscular body , his hard upright throbbing manhood . She inhaled his pleasant masculine smell . He kissed her mouth , then her face and her neck , nipping her shoulders with gentle bites that made her quiver , and murmuring under his breath , " So wonderful , so perfect . Ayla , I want you in every way . I want to see you and touch you and hold you . 0 Mother , so beautiful . " His hands were on her breasts again , his mouth on her nipples , sucking , then nipping lightly , then sucking both , making his little pleasure noises . He suckled one breast , trying to take as much in his mouth as he could , then the other . He got down on his knees in front of her , nuzzled her navel , and wrapped his arms around her legs and smooth round twin mounds , caressing them , then the split between . He nuzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slit with a wet tongue . She moaned , and he felt her quivering response . He stood up then , and eased her down to his bed , to the utterly soft , luxurious , caressing furs . He crawled in beside her , kissed her with soft biting lips , not teeth , suckled and nibbled her breasts , and with his hand , fondled and rubbed the folds and crevices of her womanhood . She moaned and cried out as he seemed to touch every place at once . He took her hand and put it on his firm , fully engorged organ . She sat up , curled around and rubbed her cheek against it , to his delight . In the dim light , she could see the outline of her light hand against his darkness . He felt smooth . His man smell was different , though , similarbut different , and his hair was wiry and tight . He moaned with sweet ecstasy when he felt a warm wetness enclose his maleness , and a drawing , pulling sensation . This was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared dream . He thought he 'd never contain himself when she began to use techniques she had so recently learned , quickly circling her tongue , drawing him in and releasing , adding firm strokes to the upright shaft . " Oh , Avla , Ayla . You are She ! I knewou were . You honor tne.  |p292Suddenly  , Ranec sat up . " I want you , and I ca n't wait . Please , now , " he said , in a throaty , strained whisper . She rolled over and opened to him . He mounted and entered , voicinga long , shuddering cry . Then he pulled back and drove in again , and again , and again , his voice rising in pitch with each stroke . Ayla arched to meet him , trying to match his pace . " Ayla , I am ready . Here it is , " he cried , straining , then suddenly , he moaned a great sigh of relief , pushed in and out a few more times , and relaxed on top of her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , Ranec pulled himself up , disengaged himself , and rolled over on his side and , propping himself up on an arm , looked down at Ayla . " I 'm afraid I was n't as perfect as you are , " he said . She frowned . " I do not understand this perfect , Ranec . What is perfect ? " " It was too fast . You are so wonderful , so perfect in what you do , I was ready too soon . I could n't wait , and I think it was n't as perfect for you , " he said . " Ranec , this is Gift of Pleasure , right ? " " Yes , that is one name for it . " " You think it was not Pleasure for me ? I had Pleasures . Many Pleasures . " " Many , but not the perfect Pleasure . If you can wait , I think with a little time , I will be ready again . " " Is not necessary . " " Maybe not necessary , Ayla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending down to kiss her . " I almost could now , " he added , caressing her breast , her stomach , and reaching for her mound . She jumped at his touch , and still quivered . " I 'm sorry , you were almost ready . If I could only have held off a little longer . " She did n't answer . He was kissing her breast , rubbing the small knob within her slit , and in an instant , she was ready again . She was moving her hips , pushing against him , crying out . Suddenly , with a surge and a cry , the release came , and he felt a warmth of wetness . She relaxed then . She smiled at him . " I think now perfect Pleasures , " she said . " Not quite , but next time , maybe . I hope there will be many next times , Ayla , " he replied , lying on his side beside her , his hand resting on her stomach . She frowned , feeling confused . She wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could see his dark hand on her light skin , and smiled . He always did like the contrast his deep coloring made against the lightness of the women he Pleasured . It left an impression no other man could make , and women noticed . They always remarked ,  |p293and  never forgot him . He was glad the Mother had chosen to give him such dark color . It made him distinctive , unusual , unforgettable . He liked the feel of her stomach under his hand , too , but even more he liked knowing she was there beside him in his bed . He had hoped for it , wished it , dreamed it , and even now , with her there , it seemed impossible . After a while he moved his hand up to her breast , fondled a nipple , and felt it harden . Ayla had begun to doze , tired and a little headachy , and when he nuzzled her neck , and then put his mouth on hers , she realized he wanted her , had given her a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant felt an urge to refuse . It surprisedher , almost shocked her , and brought her fully awake . He was kissing her neck , stroking her shoulder and arm , then feeling the fullnessand roundness of her breast . By the time he took a nipple in his mouth , she was no longer annoyed . Pleasurable sensations coursed through her depths reaching her place of perfect Pleasure . He changed to her other breast , fondling both and suckling each in turn , making his little pleasure noises in the back of his throat . " Ayla , beautiful Ayla , " Ranec murmured . Then he sat up and looked down at her on his bed . " 0 Mother ! I ca n't believe you 're here . So lovely . This time it will be perfect , Ayla . This time I know it will be perfect . " Jondalar lay rigid on the bed , jaw clamped shut , desperately wanting to use his clenched fists on the carver , but forcing himself not to move . She had looked directly at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes he saw her face , looking directly at him , then turning away . It 's her choice ! It 's her choice , he kept telling himself . She said she loved him , but how could she even know ? Of course , she might have cared about him , even loved him , when they were alone in her valley ; she did n't know anyone else then . He was the first man she ever met . But now that she had met other men , why could n't she love someone else ? He tried to convince himself that it was only fair for her to meet others and choose for herself , but he could not get it out of his mind that , on that night , she had chosen someone else . Ever since he 'd returned from his stay with Dalanar , the tall , muscular , almost beautifully handsome man had had his choice of women . A look of invitation from his unbelievable eyes , and any woman he ever wanted was his . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , hungered after him , wished he would invite them . And he did , but no woman could match his memory of his first love , or overcome his burden of guilt over it . Now , thep294one woman in the world he had finally found , the one woman he loved , was in another man 's bed . The mere thought that she had chosen someone else brought pain , but when he heard the unmistakable sounds of her sharing Pleasures with Ranec , he muffled a moan , pounded the bed , and doubled up in agony . It was like a hot coal was boiling in his belly . His chest felt tight , his throat burned , he breathed in muffled gasps as though chokingon smoky steam . Pressure forced hot tears out at the corners of his eyes though he squeezed them shut as tightly as he could . Finally it ended , and when he was sure , he relaxed a little . But then it started again , and he could n't stand it . He jumped up , stood irresolutefor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annex . Whinney 's ears perked up and turned toward him as he ran past and through the exterior arch to the outside . The wind buffeted him against the earthlodge . The sudden cold took his breath away and startled him into awareness of his surroundings . He looked out across the frozen river , and watched clouds streaming across the moon , trailing ragged edges . He took a few steps away from the shelter . Knives of wind tore through his tunic , and it seemed , through his skin and muscle to the marrow of his bone . He went back inside , shivering , plodded past the horses and into the Mammoth Hearth again . He tensed up , listening , and heard nothing at first . Then came the sounds of breathing and moaning and grunting . He looked at his bed platform , then turned back toward the annex , not knowing which way to go . He could n't stand it inside ; he could n't stay alive outside . Finally he could n't bear it . He had to go out . Grabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archway to the horses ' annex . Whinney snorted and tossed her head , and Racer , who was lying down , lifted his head off the ground and nickered a soft greeting . Jondalar headed toward the animals , spread his furs out on the ground beside Racer , and got in them . It was cold in the annex , but not nearly as cold as outside . There was no wind , some heat filtered through , and the horses generated more . And their breathing covered up the sounds of other heavy breathing . Even so , he lay awake most of the night , his mind recalling sounds , replaying scenes , real and imagined , over and over again . Ayla woke as the first slivers of daylight stole through cracks around the cover of the smoke hole . She reached across the bed for Jondalar , and was disconcerted to find Ranec . With the memory of the night before came the knowledge that she was going to have a bad headache ; the effects of " Faint 's bouza . She slipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly , and hurried to her own bed . Jondalar was not there , either . She looked around the Mammoth Hearth at the other beds . Deegie and Tornec were sleeping in one , and she wondered if they had shared Pleasures . Then she recalled that Wymez had been invited to the Aurochs Hearth and Tronie was n't feeling well . Perhaps Deegie and Tornec had just found it more convenientto sleep there . It did n't matter , but she wondered where Jondalarwas . She remembered that she had n't seen him after it grew late the night before . Someone said he had gone to bed , but where was he now ? She noticed Deegie and Tornec again . He must be sleeping at a different hearth , too , she thought . She was tempted to check , but no one else seemed to be up and about , and she did n't want to wake anyone . Feeling uneasy , she crawled into her empty bed , pulled the furs around her , and after a while , slept again . When she awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside and bright daylight beamed in . She started to get up , then , feeling an enormous throbbing pain in her head , dropped back down and closed her eyes . Either I am very sick , or this is from Talut 's bouza , she thought . Why do people like to drink it if it makes them so sick ? Then she thought about the celebration . She did n't have a clear memory of it all , but she did recall playing rhythms , dancing and singing , though she did n't really know how . She had laughed a lot , even at herself when she found she had little voice for singing , not minding at all that she was the center of attention . That was n't like her . Normally she preferred to stay in the background and watch , and do her learning and practicing in private . Was it the bouza that changed her normal inclination and caused her to be less careful ? More forward ? Is that why people drank it ? She opened her eyes again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She relieved herself in the indoor night basket  --  a tightly woven basket about half full of the dry pulverized dung of grazing animals from the steppes , which absorbed liquid and fecal matter . She washed herself with cold water . Then she stirred up the fire and added hot cooking stones . She dressed in the clothing she had made before she came , thinking of it now as a rather plain everyday outfit , though when she made it , it had seemed very exotic and complex . Still moving carefully , she took several packets from her medicine hag and mixed up willow bark , yarrow , wood betony , and chamomile in various proportions . She poured cold water into the cooking basket die used for morning tea , added hot rocks until it boiled , then the tea . Him hunkered in front of the fire with her eyes closed while sheaitcd for the tea to steep . Suddenly , she jumped up , feeling her head throb but ignoring it , : Hid reached tint her medicine hag again.  |p296I  almost forgot , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraceptive herbs . Whether it helped her totem fight off the spirit of a man 's totem , as Iza thought , or somehow resisted the essence of a man 's organ , as she suspected , Ayla did not want to take the chance of starting a baby now . Everything was too unsettled . She had wanted a baby started by Jondalar , but while she was waiting for the tea , she began to wonder how a baby , who was a mixture of her and Ranec , would look . Like him ? Like me ? Or a little of both ? Probably both , like Durc . . . and Rydag . They were mixtures . A dark son from Ranec would look different , too , except , she thought with a trace of bitterness , no one would call him an abomination , or think he was an animal . He would be able to talk and laugh and cry , just like everyone else . Knowing how Talut had appreciated her headache remedy the last time he drank his brew , Ayla made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went out to look for Jondalar . The new annex leading out directly from the Mammoth Hearth was proving to be quite a convenience , and for some reason she was glad she did n't have to go through the Fox Hearth . The horses were outside , but as she walked through , she noticed Jondalar 's traveling sleeping fur rolled up next to the wall and wondered , in passing , how it got there . As she pushed aside the drape and stepped through the second arch , she saw Talut , Wymez , and Mamut talking with Jondalar , whose back was to her . " How is head , Talut ? " she asked as she approached . " Are you offering me some of your magic morning-after medicine ? " " I have headache , and make tea . There is more , inside , " she said , then turned to Jondalar with a full , happy smile now that she had found him . For an instant her smile brought a like response , but just for an instant . Then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a look she had never seen there before . Her smile left her . " You want tea , too , Jondalar ? " she asked , confused and distraught . " Why do you think I need it ? I did n't drink too much last night , but I do n't suppose you noticed , " he replied in a voice so cold and distant she hardly recognized it . " Where you go ? I look for you early , but not in bed . " " Neither were you , " he said . " I hardly think it mattered to you where I was . " He turned and walked away from her . She looked at the other three men . She saw embarrassment on Talut 's face . Wymez looked uncomfortable , but not entirely unhappy . Mamut had a look she could n't decipher . " Ah ... I think I 'll go get some of that tea you offered , " Talut said , quickly ducking into the lodge.  | " Perhaps I 'll try a cup , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wrong ? Ayla thought , and the uneasiness she had been feeling grew into a hard knot of distress in the pit of her stomach . Mamut studied her , then said , " I think you should come and talk to me , Ayla . Later , when we can have a moment alone . Your tea may bring several visitors to the hearth now . Why do n't you get something to eat ? " " I am not hungry , " Ayla said , her stomach churning . She did not want to start out with her new people doing something wrong , and she wondered why Jondalar was so angry . Mamut smiled reassuringly . " You should try to eat something . There is mammoth meat left over from your feast , and I think Nezzie saved one of those steamed loaves for you . " Ayla nodded . As she walked toward the main entrance of the longhouse , upset and worried , she looked for the horses with the part of her mind that was always concerned for them . When she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small sense of relief . She had often drawn comfort from the animals when she was troubled , and while not a completely formed thought , she hoped that turning to them would eventually make Jondalar feel better . She passed through the foyer and into the cooking hearth . Nezzie was sitting with Rydag and Rugie , eating . She smiled when she saw Ayla and got up . For all that she was amply proportioned , Nezzie was active and graceful in her movements and , Ayla suspected , probably quite strong . " Get yourself some meat . I 'll get the loaf I put aside for you . It 's the last one , " Nezzie said . " And get a cup of hot tea , if you want . It 's fireweed and mint . " Ayla broke off pieces of the firm , moist loaf for Rydag and Rugie when she sat down with them and Nezzie , but only picked at her own ' hod . " Is something wrong , Ayla ? " the woman asked . She knew there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her with troubled eyes . " Nezzie , I know Clan ways , not Mamutoi ways . Want to learn , want to be good Mamutoi woman , but not know when I do wrong . I think last night I do something wrong . " What makes you think so ? " " When I go out , Jondalar angry . I think Talut not happy . Wymez , too . They leave , quick . Tell me what I did wrong , Nezzie . " " You did n't do anything wrong , Ayla , unless being loved by two men is wrong . Some men feel possessive when they have strong feelings for a woman . They do n't want her to be with other men . Jon/dalar feels he has a claim on you and is angry because you shared Ranec 's bed . But it is not just Jondalar . I think Ranec feels the same way , and would be just as possessive if he could . I raised him since he was a boy , and I have never seen him so taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show how he feels , but he ca n't help it , and if he showed his anger , it probably embarrassed Talut and Wymez . That might be why they left in a hurry . " Sometimes we yell a lot , or tease each other . We take pride in hospitality and like to be friendly , but the Mamutoi do not show their deepest feelings too much . It can cause trouble , and we try to avoid disputes and discourage fighting . The Council of Sisters even frowns on the raids the young men like to make on other people , like the Sungaea , and are trying to ban them . The Sisters say it just invites raids in return , and people have been killed . They say it 's better to trade than raid . The Council of Brothers is more lenient . Most of them did a bit of raiding in their youth , and say it 's just a way to use young muscles and make a little excitement for themselves . " Ayla was no longer listening . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused . Was Jondalar angrybecause she had responded to another man 's signal ? Was that a reason to get angry ? No man of the Clan would indulge in such an emotional response . Broud was the only man who had ever shown the least interest in her , and then only because he knew she hated it . But many people wondered why he was bothering with such an ugly woman and he would have welcomed interest by another man . When she thought about it , she realized that Jondalar had been bothered by Ranec 's interest from the beginning . Mamut came in from the entrance foyer walking with discernible difficulty . " Nezzie , I promised to fill Mamut 's medicine bowl with help for arthritis , " Ayla said . She got up to help him , but he waved her away . " You go ahead . I 'll be there . It will just take me a little longer . " She rushed through the Lion Hearth and the Fox Hearth , relieved to find it empty , and added fuel to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her medications , she recalled the many times she had applied poultices and plasters , and made painkilling drinks to ease Creb 's aching joints . It was one aspect of her medicine she knew very well . She waited until Mamut was resting comfortably , sipping a warm tea after she had drawn off and soaked away most of his ancient aches , before she asked any questions . It was soothing for her as well as the old shaman to apply her knowledge , skill , and intelligence in the prac/tice of her craft , and it relieved some of the stress she had been feeling . Yet when she picked up a cup of tea and sat opposite Mamut , she did n't quite know where to begin . " Mamut , did you stay long with Clan ? " she finally asked . " Yes , it takes awhile for a bad break to heal , and by then , I wantedto know more , so I stayed until they left for the Clan Gathering . " " You learn Clan ways ? " " Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Ayla , I know about the signal a man gives a woman . " He paused , seeming to consider , then continued , " I will tell you something I have never told anyone else . There was a young woman who helped to take care of me while my arm was mending , and after I was included in a hunting ceremony and hunted with them , she was given to me . I know what the signal is , and what it means . I used the signal , though at first I was not comfortable about it . She was a flathead woman , and not very appealing to me , particularly since I 'd heard so many stories about them while I was growing up . But I was young and healthy , and I was expected to behave like a man of the Clan . " The longer I stayed , the more appealing she became  --  you have no idea how appealing it can be to have someone waiting on your every need or desire . It was n't until later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second woman , her first mate had died so one of the other hunters took her in , a little reluctantly since she came from a different clan and had no children . When I left , I did not want to leave her behind , but I felt she would be happier with a clan than with me and my people . And I was n't sure how I would be welcomed if I returned with a flathead woman . I have often wondered what happened to her . " Ayla closed her eyes as memories flooded over her . It seemed uncannyto be learning bits and pieces about her clan from this man whom she had met such a short time ago . She fitted his story together with her own knowledge of the history of Brun 's clan . " She not ever have children , always second woman , but always someone take in . She die in earthquake , before they find me . " He nodded . He , too , was glad to have an important bit of his past filled in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed . Is true ? " " I think that 's true . " " lout Ranec give me signal ! How can Jondalar be angry if Ranec give me signal ? " " Where did Ranec learn the Clan signal ? " Manna asked , surprised. p 300 " Not Clan signal . Signal of the Others . When Jondalar find my valley , and teach me First Rites and Gift of Pleasure from Great Earth Mother Doni , I ask what his signal is ? He put mouth on mine , make kiss . Put hand on me , make . . . feel Pleasure . He say that is how I will know when he want me ; he tell me his signal . Ranec give me signal last night . Then he say , I want you . Come to my bed . ' Ranec give me signal . He make command . " Mamut looked up at the ceiling , and said , " 0 Mother ! " Then he looked back at her . " Ayla , you do n't understand . Ranec certainly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't a command . " Ayla looked at him with intense puzzlement . " I not understand . " " No one can command you , Ayla . Your body belongs to you , it 's your choice . You decide what you want to do and who you want to do it with . You can go to any man 's bed you choose , so long as he is willing  --  and I do n't see much problem there  --  but you do n't have to share Pleasures with any man you do n't want to , ever . " She stopped to think about his words . " What if Ranec commands again ? He said , wants me again , many times . " " I do n't doubt that he wants , but he can not command you . No one can command you , Ayla . Not against your will . " " Not even man I mate ? Not ever ? " " I do n't think you 'd remain mated for very long under those circumstances , but no , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not own you . Only you can decide . " " Mamut , when Ranec gave me signal , I not have to go ? " " That 's right . " He looked at her frown . " Are you sorry you went to his bed ? " " Sorry ? " She shook her head . " No . Not sorry . Ranec is . . . good . Is not rough . . . like Broud . Ranec . . . care for me . . . make good Pleasures . No . Not sorry about Ranec . Sorry about Jondalar . Sorry Jondalar angry . Ranec make good Pleasures , but Ranec is . . . not Jondalar. "  |p301Ayla  turned her head to the side as she leaned into the screaming wind , trying to shield her face from the raw blast of galedrivensnow . Each careful step forward was violently opposed by a force made visible only by the swirling mass of frozen white grit hurled against her . As the angry blizzard raged , she faced the lash of stinging pellets and squinted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . Buffeted by the fierce storm , she looked again . The smooth rounded shape ahead beckoned , and she was relieved finallyto touch the solid ivory arch . " Ayla , you should n't have gone out in that blizzard ! " Deegie said . " You can lose your way a few steps beyond the entrance . " " But it has been blowing like that for many , many days , and Whinneyand Racer go out . I want to know where they go . " " Did you find out ? " " Yes . They like to feed at place around bend . Wind does not blow so hard , and snow does not cover dry grass too high . Blows drift on other side . I have some grain , but have not grass left . Horses know where is grass , even when blizzard blows . I will give water here , when they come back , " Ayla said , stamping her feet , and shaking the snow off the parka she had just pulled off . She hung it up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her way in . " Can you believe it ? She went outside . In this weather ! " Deegie announced to the several people who were congregated at the fourth hearth . " But why ? " Tornec asked " horses need to eat , and I . . . " Ayla started to reply . " I thought you were gone a long time , " Ranec said . " When I askedMamut , he said he had last seen you go into the horse hearth , butwhen I looked you were n't there . " " Everyone started looking for you , Ayla , " Tronie said . " Then Jondalar noticed your parka was gone , and the horses , too . He thought you might have gone out with them , " Deegie said , " so we decided we 'd better look for you outside . When I looked out to see how the weather was , I saw you coming . "  | " Ayla , you should let someone know if you are going out when the weather is bad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make people worry when you go out in a blizzard like this ? " Jondalar said , his tone more angry . Ayla tried to answer , but everyone was talking at once . She looked at all the faces watching her , and flushed . " I am sorry . I did not mean to make worry . I live alone long time , have no people to worry . I go out and come in when I want . I am not used to people , to have someoneworry , " she said , looking at Jondalar , then at the others . Mamut saw Ayla 's brow knit in a frown as the blond man turned away . Jondalar felt himself flush as he walked away from the people who had been worried about Ayla . She was right , she had lived alone and taken care of herself just fine . What right did he have to question her actions , or take her to task for not telling anyone she was going out ? But he had been fearful from the moment he discovered she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen bad weather  --  winters where he grew up were exceptionally cold and bleak  --  but he had never seen weather so severe . This storm had raged without letup for half the season , it seemed . No one had been more fearful for her safety than Jondalar , but he did n't want to show his deep concern . He 'd been having difficulty talking to her since the night of her adoption . At first , he was so hurt that she had chosen someone else , he had withdrawn , and was ambivalentabout his own feelings . He was wildly jealous , yet he doubted his love for her because he had been ashamed that he brought her . Ayla had not shared Ranec 's furs again , but every night Jondalar was afraid she might . It made him tense and nervous , and he found himself staying away from the Mammoth Hearth until after she was in bed . When he did finally join her on their sleeping platform , he turned his back and resisted touching her , afraid he might lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love him . But Ayla did n't know why he was avoiding her . When she tried to talk to him , he answered in monosyllables , or pretended to be asleep ; when she put an arm around him , he was stiff and unresponsive . It seemed to her that he did n't like her any more , especially after he brought separate furs to sleep in , so he would n't feel the searing touch of her body next to his . Even during the day , he stayed away from her . Wymez , Danug , and he had set up a flint-working area in the cooking hearth and Jondalar spent most of his waking hours there  --  he could n't stand working with Wymez at the Fox Hearth , across the passageway from the bed Ayla had shared with Ranec . After a while , when her friendly advances had been rebuffed toop303often , she became confused and hesitant and drew back from him . Only then did he finally begin to realize that the growing distance between them was his own doing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced and knowledgeable as he was about women , he had no experience with being in love . He found himself reluctant to tell her how he felt about her . He remembered young women following him around , declaring their strong feelings for him , when he did n't feel strongly about them . It had made him uncomfortable , made him want to get away . He did n't want Ayla to feel that way about him , so he held back . Ranec knew they were not sharing Pleasures . He was excruciatinglyconscious of Ayla every moment , though he tried not to make it obvious . He knew when she went to bed and when she woke , what she ate and with whom she spoke , and he spent as much time as he could at the Hearth of the Mammoth . Among those who gathered there , Ranec 's wit , sometimes directed at one member or another of the Lion Camp , was often the cause of raucous laughter . He was scrupulouslycareful , however , never to denigrate Jondalar , whether Ayla was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way with words , but such cleverness had never been Jondalar 's strong point . Ranec 's compact muscularity and insouciant self-confidence had the effect of making the tall , dramatically handsome man feel like a big oaf . As the winter progressed , Jondalar and Ayla 's unresolved misunderstandingkept getting worse . Jondalar was becoming afraid that he would lose her entirely to the dark , exotic , and engaging man . He kept trying to convince himself that he should be fair , and let her make the choice , that he did n't have any right to make demands on her . But he stayed away because he did n't want to present her with a choice which would give her the opportunity to reject him . The Mamutoi did not seem disturbed by the harsh weather . They had plenty of food stored , and busied themselves with their usual winter diversions , snug and secure inside their semisubterranean longhouse . The older members of the Camp tended to gather around the cooking hearth , sipping hot tea , telling stories , reminiscing , gossiping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bone , when they were not busy on some project . The younger people congregatedaround the Mammoth Hearth , laughing and joking , singing songs and practicing musical instruments , though there was a great deal of intermixing among everyone , and the children were welcome everywhere . This was the time of leisure ; the time to make and mend tools and weapons , utensils and jewelry ; the time to weave basketsp304and mats , to carve ivory , bone , and antler ; to make thongs , ropes , cords , and nets ; and the time to make and decorate clothing . Ayla was interested in how the Mamutoi processed their leather and , especially , how they colored it . She was also intrigued with the colored embroidery , quill and beadwork . Decorated and sewn clothingwas new and unusual to her . " You said you would show me how to make leather red after I make skin ready . I think bison skin I am working on is ready , " Ayla said . " All right , I 'll show you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ayla went to the storage platform near the head of her bed and unfolded a complete hide , and spread it out . It was incredibly soft to the touch , pliable , and nearly white . Deegie examined it critically . She had watched Ayla 's process without comment , but with great interest . First Ayla had cut off the heavy mane close to the skin with a sharp knife , then she beamed it ; draped it over a large smooth mammoth leg bone and scraped it , using the slightly dulled edge of a flint flake . She scraped the inside to remove clinging bits of fat and blood vessels , and the outside , against the lay of the hair , taking off the outer layer of skin , which included the grain of the leather , as well . Deegie would have rolled it up and left it near the fire for a few days , allowing it to begin to decay , to loosen the hair . When she was ready , the hair would come out , leaving behind the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather . To make the softer buckskin , as Ayla had done , she would have tied it to a frame to scrape off the hair and the grain . Ayla 's next step incorporated a suggestion from Deegie . After soakingand washing , Ayla had planned to rub fat into the hide to soften it , as she was accustomed to doing . But Deegie showed Ayla how to make a thin gruel of the putrefying brains of the animal to soak the hide in instead . Ayla was both surprised and pleased at the results . She could feel the change in the hide , the softening and elasticity which the brain tissue imparted , even while she was rubbing it in . But it was after thoroughly wringing out the hide that the work began . It had to be pulled and stretched constantly while it was drying , and the quality of the finished leather depended upon how well the hide was worked at this stage . " You do have a good hand for leather , Ayla . Bison hide is heavy , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided what you want to make out of it ? " " No . " Ayla shook her head . " But I want to make leather red . What do you think ? Footwear ? " " It 's heavy enough for it , but soft enough for a tunic . Let 's go aheadp305and color it . You can think about what to make with it later , " Deegie said , and as they walked toward the last hearth together , she asked , " What would you do with that hide now ? If you were not going to color it ? " " I would put over very smoky fire , so leather will not get stiff again , if it gets wet , from rain , or even from swimming , " Ayla said . Deegie nodded . " That 's what I would do , too . But what we are going to do to the hide will make the rain slide off . " They passed by Crozie when they walked through the Crane Hearth , which reminded Ayla of something she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how to make leather white , too ? Like tunic Crozie wear ? I like red , but after that , I would like to learn white . I think I know someone who would like white . " " White is hard to do , hard to get leather really snowy white . I think Crozie could show you better than I could . You would need chalk .. . Wymez might have some . Flint is found in chalk , and usually the pieces he gets from the mine up north have a covering of chalk on the outside , " Deegie said . The young women walked back to the Mammoth Hearth with some small mortars and pestles , and several lumps of red ochre coloringmaterial in various shades . Deegie set some fat to melting over the tire , then arrayed the colored bits of material around Ayla . There were bits of charcoal for black , manganese for a blue-black , and a bright sulphurous yellow , in addition to ochres of many colors : browns , reds , maroons , yellows . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the frontal bone of a deer , or pecked out of granite or basalt , just as the stone lamps were . Pestles were shaped out of hard ivory or bone , except one , which was an elongated natural stone . " What shade of red do you want , Ayla ? Deep red , blood red , earth red , yellow red ; that 's sort of a sun color . " Ayla did n't know she would have so many choices . " I do n't know . . . red red , " she replied . Deegie studied the colors . " I think if we take this one , " she said , picking up a piece that was a rather bright earth red , " and add a little yellow to it , to bring out the red more , it might be a color you would like . She put the small lump of red ochre in the stone mortar and showed Ayla how to grind it very fine , then had her grind up the yellow color in a separate bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors until she was satisfied with the shade . Then she added the hot tat , which changed the color , and brightened it to a shade that made Ayla smile.  | " Yes . That is red . That is nice red , " she said . Next Deegie picked up a long deer rib , which had been split lengthwiseso that the porous inner bone was exposed at the convex end . Using the rib burnisher with the spongy side down , she picked up a dab of the cooled red fat , and rubbed the mixture into the prepared bison skin , pressing hard as she held the hide in her hand . As she worked the mineral coloring into the pores of the material , the leather acquired a smooth sheen . On leather with grain , the burnishing tool and coloring agents would have given it a hard shiny finish . After watching awhile , Ayla picked up another rib bone and copied Deegie 's technique . Deegie watched her , offered a few corrections . When a corner of the hide was finished , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , sprinkling a few drops of water on the hide as she held up the corner . " It runs off , see ? " The water beaded up and ran down , leaving no mark on the impervious finish . " Have you decided what you are going to do with your red piece of leather , yet ? " Nezzie asked . " No , " Ayla said . She had unfolded the full bison hide to show Rydag and to admire it herself again . It was hers , because she had dressed and treated the hide , and she had never owned so much of anything that was red , and the leather had turned out to be remarkablyred . " Red was sacred to Clan . I would give to Creb . . . if I could . " " It is the brightest red I think I have ever seen . You would certainly see someone coming for a long way wearing that . " " It is soft , too , " Rydag signed . He often came to the Mammoth Hearth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deegie showed me how to make soft with brain , first , " Ayla said , smiling at her friend . " I use fat before . Hard to do , and stains , sometimes . Better using brain of bison . " She paused with a thoughtful expression , then asked , " Will work for every animal , Deegie ? " Then , when Deegie nodded , " How much brain should use ? How much for reindeer ? How much for rabbit ? " " Mut , the Great Mother , in her infinite wisdom , " Ranec replied instead , with the hint of a grin , " always gives just enough brains to each animal to preserve its hide . " Rydag 's soft guttural chuckle puzzled Ayla for a moment , then she smiled . " Some have enough brains , do not get caught ? " Ranec laughed , and Ayla joined him , pleased with herself for understandingthe joke hidden in the meaning . She was becoming much more comfortable with the language.  |p307Jondalar  , just walking into the Mammoth Hearth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churn into a knot . Mamut saw him close his eyes as though in pain . He glanced at Nezzie and shook his head . Danug , who had been following behind the visiting flint worker , watched him stop , clutch a post , and drop his head . The feelings of Jondalar and Ranec for Ayla , and the problem that was developing because of them was apparent to all , though most people did not acknowledgeit . They did n't want to interfere , hoping to give the three of them room to work it out for themselves . Danug wished he could do something to help , but he was at a loss . Ranec was a brother , since Nezzie had adopted him , but he liked Jondalar and felt empathy for his anguish . He , too , had strong , if undefined , feelings for the beautifulnew member of the Lion Camp . Beyond the inexplicable flushes and physical sensations when he was near her , he felt an affinity with her . She seemed to be as confused about how to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications in his life . Jondalar took a deep breath and straightened up , then continued into the area . Ayla 's eyes followed him as he walked over to Mamut and handed him something . She watched them exchange a few words , then Jondalar left , quickly , without saying a word to her . She had lost the thread of the conversation going on around her , and when Jondalarleft , she hurried to Mamut , not hearing the question Ranec had asked her , or seeing the fleeting look of disappointment on his face . He made a joke , which she also did not hear , to cover his dismay . But Nezzie , who was sensitive to the subtle nuances of his deeper feelings , noticed the hurt in his eyes , and then saw him set his jaw and square his shoulders with resolution . She wanted to advise him , to give him the benefit of her experience and the wisdom of her years , but she held her tongue . They must work out their own destinies , she thought . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , they had to learn to tolerate each other . There was no real privacyin the earthlodge , except the privacy of each person 's thoughts , and they were very careful not to intrude into another 's private thoughts . They shied away from asking personal questions , or pressinguninvited offers of assistance and advice , or intervening in private squabbles unless they were asked , or if the squabbles got out of hand and became a problem for everyone . Instead , if they saw a troubling situation developing , they quietly made themselves available and waited with patience and forbearance until a friend was wanted to discuss worries , fears , and frustrations . They were not judgmental or highly critical , and they imposed few restrictions on personal behaviorp308if it did not hurt or seriously disturb others . A solution to a problem was one that worked , and satisfied everyone involved . They were gentlewith each other 's souls . " Mamut . . . " Ayla began , then realized she did n't know exactly what she wanted to say . " Ah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine for arthritis . " " I would not object , " the old man said , smiling . " I have not had as comfortable a winter in many years . If for no other reason , I am glad you are here , Ayla . Let me put away this knife I won from Jondalar , and I will put myself in your hands . " " You win knife from Jondalar ? " " Crozie and I were wagering with the knucklebones . He was watching and looked interested , so I invited him to play . He said he would like to , but he had nothing to wager . I told him as long as he had his skill , he always had something , and said I 'd bet against a special knife that I wanted to be made in a certain way . He lost . He should know better than to wager against One Who Serves . " Mamut chuckled . " Here 's the knife . " Ayla nodded . His answer satisfied her curiosity , but she wished someone could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The group of people who had been admiring Ayla 's red leather hide broke up and left the Mammoth Hearth , except for Rydag , who joined Ayla and Mamut . There was something comforting about watching her treat the old shaman . He settled himself on a corner of the bed platform . " I will make hot poultice for you first , " she said , and began to mix ingredients in a wooden bowl . Mamut and Rydag watched her measuring , mixing , heating water . " What do you use in the poultice ? " Mamut asked . " I do not know your words for plants . " " Describe them to me . Maybe I can tell you . I know a few plants and some remedies ; I 've had to learn some . " " One plant , grows higher than knee , " Ayla explained , thinking about the plant carefully . " Has big leaves , not bright green , like dust on them . Leaves grow together with stem first , then get big , then come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur . Leaves good for many things , and roots , too , especially broken bones . " " Comfrey ! That must be comfrey . What else is in the poultice ? " This is interesting , he thought . " Other plant , smaller , does not reach knee . Leaves , like small spear point Wymez makes , dark shiny green , stay green in winter . Stem comes up from leaves , has little flowers , light color , small red spots inside . Good for swellings , rash , too , " Ayla said.  |p309Mamut  was shaking his head . " Leaves stay green in winter , spotted flowers . I do n't think I know that one . Why not just call it spotted wintergreen . " Ayla nodded . " Do you want to know other plants ? " she asked . " Yes , go ahead and describe another . " " Big plant , bigger than Talut , almost tree . Grows on low ground , near rivers . Dark purple berries stay on plant even in winter . Young leaves good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sick . Dried root in poultice is good for swelling , red swelling , too , and for pain . I put dried berries in tea I make for your arthritis . Do you know name ? " " No , I do n't think so , but as long as you know the plant , I 'm satisfied , " Mamut said . " Your remedies for my arthritis have helped , you are good with medicine for elders . " " Creb was old . He was lame and had pain from arthritis . I learn from Iza how to help . Then I help others in clan . " Ayla paused and looked up from her mixing . " I think Crozie suffer pains of age , too . I want to help . You think she object , Mamut ? " " She does n't like to admit to the failings of age . She was a proud beauty in her younger years , but I think you are right . You could ask her , especially if you can think of a way that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left now . " Ayla nodded . When the preparation was ready , Mamut removed his clothing . " When you are resting , with poultice , " she said , " I have root powder of other plant I want to put on hot coals for you to smell . Will make you sweat , and is good for pain . Then , before you sleep tonight , I have new wash for joints . Apple juice and hot root . . . " " You mean horseradish ? The root Nezzie uses , with food . " " I think , yes , with apple juice and Talut 's bouza . Will make skin warm , and inside skin warm , too . " Mamut laughed . " How did you ever get Talut to let you put his bouza outside on the skin , and not inside ? " Ayla smiled . " He likes magic morning-after medicine . ' I say I will always make for him , " she said while she applied a thick , gummy , hot healing plaster to the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " This arm look good , " Ayla commented , working on the arm that had been broken . " I think was bad break . " " It was a bad break , " Mamut said , opening his eyes again . He glanced at Rydag , who was quietly taking everything in . Mamut had not spoken of his experience to anyone but Ayla . He paused , then nodded sharply with decision . " It 's time you knew , Rydag . When I was a young man on a Journey , I fell down a cliff and broke my arm.  |p310I  was dazed , and finally wandered into a Camp of flatheads , people of the Clan . I lived with them for a while . " " That is why you quick to learn signs ! " Rydag smiled . " I thought you very smart . " " I am very smart , young man , " Mamut said , grinning back , " but I also remembered some of them , once Ayla reminded me . " Rydag 's smile widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lion Hearth family , he loved these two people more than anyone in the world , and he had never been so happy since Ayla came . For the first time in his life , he could talk , he could make people understand him , he could even make someone smile . He watched Ayla working on Mamut , and even he could recognize her thoroughness and knowledge . When Mamut looked in his direction , he signaled , " Ayla is good Healer . " " The medicine women of the Clan are very skilled ; she learned from them . No one could have done a better job on my arm . The skin was scraped , with dirt ground in , and it was torn open with the brokenbone poking through . It looked like a piece of meat . The woman , Uba , cleaned it and set it right , and it did not even swell up with pus and fever . I had full use when it healed , and only in these later years have I felt a little ache now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arm . I was told she was considered the best , " Mamut announced , watching Rydag 's reaction . The boy looked at both of them quizzically , wondering how they could know the same people . " Yes . And Iza was best , like her mother and her grandmother , " Ayla said , finishing up . She had n't been paying attention to the silent communicationbetween the boy and the old man . " She knew all her mother knew , had mother 's memories , and grandmother 's memories . " Ayla moved some stones from the fireplace closer to Mamut 's bed , scooped up a few live coals with two sticks and put them on the stones , then sprinkled powdered honeybloom root on the coals . She went to get covers for Mamut to keep the heat in , but while she was tucking them around him , he got up on one elbow and looked at her thoughtfully . " The people of the Clan are different in a way that most people do n't realize . It 's not that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . It 's that the way they think is a little different . If Uba , the woman who took care of me , was the grandmother of your Iza , and she learned from her mother 's and grandmother 's memories , how did you learn , Ayla ? You do n't have Clan memories . " Mamut noticed an embarrassed flush , and a quick little gasp of surprise before Ayla looked down . " Or do you ? "  |p311Ayla  looked up at him again , then down . " No . I do not have Clan memories , " she said . " But . . . ? " Ayla looked back at him . " What do you mean , but ' ? " she said . Her expression was wary , almost frightened . She looked down again . " You do not have Clan memories , but . . . you have something , do n't you ? Something of the Clan ? " Ayla kept her head bowed . How could he know ? She had never told anyone , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she had never been quite the same afterward . There were those times , that came on her . . . " Does it have something to do with your skill as a medicine woman ? " Mamut asked . She looked up and shook her head . " No , " she said , her eyes pleadingfor him to believe her . " Iza teach me , I was very young , I think I was not yet age of Rugie when she begin . Iza knew I did not have memories , but she make me remember , make me tell her again and again until I do not forget . She is very patient . Some people tell her , is foolish to teach me . I can not remember . . . I am too stupid . She tell them no , I am just different . I do not want to be different . I make myself remember . I say to myself , over and over , even when Iza is not teaching me . I learn to remember , my way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am so stupid . " Rydag 's eyes were opened big and round . More than anyone , he understood exactly how she had felt , but he did n't know anyone had ever felt the same way , especially someone like Ayla . Mamut looked at her with amazement . " So you memorized Iza 's Clan memories . ' That 's quite an accomplishment . They go back generation after generation , do n't they ? " Rydag was listening closely now , sensing something very important to him . " Yes , " Ayla said , " but I did not learn all her memories . Iza could not teach me all she knew . She told me she did not even know how much she knew , but she teach me how to learn . How to test , how to try carefully . Then , when I am older , she said I was her daughter , medicine woman of her line . I ask , how can I claim her line ? I am not her true daughter . I am not even Clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I have something else , as good as memories , maybe better . Iza thought I was born to line of medicine women of the Others , best line , like her line was best . That is why I am medicine woman of her line . She said someday I would he best . " " Do you know what she meant ? I ) o you know what you have ? " Mamut asked  | " Yes , I think so . When someone not well , I see what is wrong . I see look of eyes , color of face , smell of breath . I think about it , sometimes know just looking , other times , know what to ask . Then make medicineto help . Not always same medicine . Sometimes new medicine , like bouza in arthritis wash . " " Your Iza may have been right . The best Healers have that gift , " the Mamut said , then a thought occurred to him , and he continued , " I have noticed one difference between you and the Healers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other treatments to heal , Mamutoi Healers call upon the assistance of the spirits as well . " " I do not know world of spirits . In Clan only mog-urs know . When Iza want help of spirits , she ask Creb . " The Mamut stared hard into the eyes of the young woman . " Ayla , would you like to have the help of the spirit world ? " " Yes , but I have no mog-ur to ask . " " You do n't have to ask anyone . You can be your own mog-ur . " " Me ? A mog-ur ? But I am a woman . A woman of the Clan can not be a mog-ur , " Ayla said , stunned at the suggestion . " But you are not a woman of the Clan . You are Ayla of the Mamutoi . You are a daughter of the Mammoth Hearth . The best Mamutoi Healers know the ways of the spirits . You are a good Healer , Ayla , but how can you be the best if you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a great knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach . She was a medicine woman , a good medicine woman , and Iza said someday she would be the best . Now Mamut said she could not be the best withoutthe help of the spirits , and he must be right . Iza always asked Creb to help , did n't she ? " But I do not know world of spirits , Mamut , " Ayla said , feeling desperate , almost panicky . Mamut leaned close to her , sensing the moment was right , and drawing from some inner source a power to compel . " Yes , you do , " he said , his tone commanding , " do n't you , Ayla ? " Her eyes flew open in fear . " I do not want to know spirit world ! " she cried . " You only fear that world because you do n't understand it . I can help you to understand it . I can help you to use it . You were born to the Hearth of the Mammoth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you were born or where you go . You can not help yourself , you are drawn to it , and it seeks you . You can not escape it , but with training and understanding , you can control it . You can make the mysteries work for you . Ayla , you can not fight your destiny , and it is your destiny to Serve the Mother . "  | " I am medicine woman ! That is my destiny . " " Yes , that is your destiny , to be a medicine woman , but that is Serving the Mother , and someday , you may be called to serve in another way . You need to be prepared . Ayla , you want to be the best medicine woman , do n't you ? Even you know that some sickness cannotbe healed by medicines and treatments alone . How do you cure someone who no longer wants to live ? What medicine gives someone the will to recover from a serious accident ? When someone dies , what treatment do you give the ones left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known what to do for her when Iza died , she might not have lost her milk and had to give her son to the other women with babies to nurse . Would she know what to do if that happened to someone she was taking care of ? Would knowledge of the spirit world help her to know what to do ? Rydag was watching the tense scene , knowing he had been forgottenfor the moment . He was afraid to move , afraid it would distract them from something very important , though he was n't sure what it was . " Ayla , what is it you fear ? What happened to make you turn away ? Tell me about it , " Mamut said , his voice persuasively warm . Ayla got up suddenly . She picked up the warm furs and tucked them around the old shaman . " Must cover , keep warm for poultice to work , " she said , obviously distracted and upset . Mamut lay back , allowedher to complete her treatment of him without objection , realizingshe needed time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes unfocused , staring into space or at some internal scene . She spun around and faced him . " I did not mean to ! " she said . " What did n't you mean to do ? " Mamut said . " Go into cave . . . see mog-urs . " " When did you go into the cave , Ayla ? " Mamut knew the restrictionsagainst women participating in Clan rituals . She must have done something she was n't supposed to , broken some taboo , he thought . " At Clan Gathering . " " You went to a Clan Gathering ? They hold a Gathering once very seven years , is n't that right ? " Ayla nodded . " How long ago was this Gathering ? " She had to stop , think about it , and the concentration cleared her mind a bit . " Durc was just born then , in spring . Next summer , will be seven years ! Next summer , is Clan Gathering . Clan will go to Gathering , bring Ura hack . Ura and Durc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Is that true , Ayla ? He will be only seven years when he mates ? Your son will be a man so young ? " Mamut asked . " No , not so young . Maybe three , four more years . He is . . . like Druwez . Not yet man . But mother of Ura ask me for Durc , for Ura . She is child of mixed spirits , too . Ura will live with Brun and Ebra . When Durc and Ura old enough , will mate . " Rydag stared at Ayla in disbelief . He did n't entirely understand all the implications , but one thing seemed certain . She had a son , mixed like him , who lived with the Clan ! " What happened at the Clan Gathering seven years ago , Ayla ? " Mamut asked , not wanting to let it drop when he had seemed so close to getting an agreement from Ayla to begin training , although she had brought up some intriguing points he would like to ask her about . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential , for her own sake . Ayla closed her eyes with a pained expression . " Iza is too sick to go . She tell Brun I am medicine woman , Brun make ceremony . She tell me how to chew root to make drink for mog-urs . Tell only , can not show me . Is too . . sacred to make for practice . Mog-urs at Clan Gathering not want me , I am not Clan . But no one else knows , only Iza 's line . Finally say yes . Iza tell me not swallow juice when I chew , spit into bowl , but I can not . I swallow some . Later , I am confused , go into cave , follow fires , find mog-urs . They not see me , but Creb knows . She became agitated again , paced back and forth . It is dark , like deep hole and I am falling . " She hunched her shoulders , rubbed her arms , as though she was cold . " Then Creb come , like you , Mamut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . take me with him . " She was silent then , pacing . Finally she stopped and spoke again . " Later , Creb is very angry and unhappy . And I am . . . different . I never say , but sometimes I think I go back there , and I am . . . frightened . " Mamut waited , to see if she was finished . He had some idea what she had gone through . He had been allowed at a Clan ceremony.They used certain plants in unique ways , and he had experienced something unfathomable . He had tried , but he had never been able to duplicate the experience , even after he became Mamut . He was about to say something when Ayla spoke again . " Sometimes I want to throw root away , but Iza tell me is sacred . " It took a moment for the meaning of Ayla 's words to register , but the shock of recognition nearly brought him to his feet . " Are you saying you have that root with you ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I leave , take medicine bag . Root is in medicine bag , in specialred pouch . " " But is it still good ? You say it 's been more than three years since you left . Would n't it lose potency in that time ? " " No , is prepared special way . After root is dried , keeps long time . Many years . " " Ayla , " the Mamut began , trying to phrase his words just right , " it could be very fortunate that you have it still . You know , the best way to overcome a fear is to face it . Would you be willing to prepare that root again ? Just for you and me ? " Ayla shivered at the thought . " I do not know , Mamut . I do not want to . I am frightened . " " I do n't mean right away , " he said . " Not until you have had some training and are prepared for it . And it should be a special ceremony , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of new life . " He saw her shake again . " It 's up to you , but you do not have to decide now . All I ask is that you allow me to begin training and preparation . When spring comes , if you do n't feel ready , you can say no . " What is training ? " Ayla asked . " First , I would want you to learn certain songs and chants , and how to use the mammoth skull . Then there is the meaning of certain symbols and signs . " Rydag watched her close her eyes and frown . He hoped she would agree . He had just learned more about his mother 's people than he ever knew , but he wanted to learn more . If Mamut and Ayla planned a ceremony with Clan rituals , he was sure he would . When Ayla opened them , her eyes looked troubled , but she swallowedhard , and then nodded . " Yes , Mamut . I try to face fear of spirit world , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't notice Ayla clutch the small decorated bag she wore around her neck.  |p316Hu  ! Hu ! Hu ! That 's three ! " Crozie cried out , chuckling shrewdly as she counted the discs with the marked side up that had been caught in the shallow woven bowl . " Your turn again , " Nezzie said . They were sitting on the floor besidethe circular pit of dry loess soil , which Talut had used to map out a hunting plan . " You still have seven to go . I 'll bet two more . " She made two more lines on the smoothed surface of the drawing pit . Crozie picked up the wicker bowl and shook the seven small ivory discs together . The discs , which bellied out slightly so that they rocked when they were on a flat surface , were plain on one side ; the other side was carved with lines and colored . Keeping the wide , shallowbowl near the floor , Crozie flipped the discs into the air . Then , moving it smartly across the red-bordered mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the discs in the basket . This time four of the discs had their marked side up and only three were plain . " Look at that ! Four ! Only three to go . I 'll wager five more . " Ayla , sitting on a mat nearby , sipped tea from her wooden cup and watched the old woman shake the discs together in the bowl again . Crozie threw them up and caught them once more . This time five discs had the side with marks carved into them showing . " I win ! Do you want to try again , Nezzie ? " " Well , maybe one more game , " Nezzie said , reaching for the wicker bowl and shaking it . She tossed the discs in the air , and caught them in the flat basket . " There 's the black eye ! " Crozie cried , pointing to a disc that had turned up a side which was colored black . " You lose ! That makes twelve you owe me . Do you want to play another game ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nezzie said , getting up . " How about you , Ayla ? " Crozie said . " Do you want to play a game ? " " I am not good at that game , " Ayla said . " I do not catch all the pieces sometimes . " She had watched the gaming many times as the bitter cold of thep317long season deepened , but had played little , and then only for practice . She knew Crozie was a serious player who did not play for practice , and had little patience with inept or indecisive players . " Well , how about Knucklebones ? You do n't need any skill to play that . " " I would play , but I do not know what to bet , " Ayla said . " Nezzie and I play for marks and settle it out later . " " Now or later , I do not know what to bet . " " Certainly you have something you can wager , " Crozie said , somewhatimpatient to get on with the game . " Something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value ? " The old woman nodded brusquely . " Of course . " Ayla frowned with concentration . " Maybe . . . furs , or leather , or something to make . Wait ! I think I know something . Jondalar played with Mamut and bet skill . He made special knife when he lost . Is skill good to bet , Crozie ? " " Why not ? " she said . " I 'll mark it , here , " Crozie said , smoothing the dirt with the flat side of the drawing knife . The woman picked up two objects from the ground beside her and held them out , one in each hand . " We 'll count three marks to a game . If you guess right , you get a mark . If you guess wrong , I get a mark . The first one to get three , wins the game . " Ayla looked at the two metacarpal bones of a musk-ox which she held , one painted with red and black lines , the other plain . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . " That is right , " Crozie said , a crafty gleam in her eye . " Are you ready ? " She rubbed both palms together with the knucklebones inside , but she looked over at Jondalar sitting with Danug in the flintworkingarea . " Is he really as good as they say ? " she said , cocking her head in his direction . Ayla glanced toward the man , blond head bent close to the redhairedboy 's . When she looked back around , Crozie had both hands behind her back . " Yes . Jondalar is good , " she said . Had Crozie purposely tried to direct her attention elsewhere , to distract her ? she wondered . She looked at the woman carefully , noticingthe slight tilt of her shoulders , the way she held her head , the expression on her face . Crozie brought her hands in front of her again and held them out , each closed into a fist around a bone . Ayla studied the wrinkled face , which had become blank and unexpressive , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a trifle closer to her chest ? Avla picked the other.  | " You lose ! " Crozie gloated , as she opened the hand to show the bone marked with red and black . She drew a short line in the drawing pit . " Are you ready to try again ? " " Yes , " Ayla said . This time Crozie began humming to herself as she rubbed the bones together between her palms . She closed her eyes , then looked up at the ceiling and stared , as though she saw something interesting near the smoke hole . Ayla was tempted to look up to see what was so fascinating , and started to follow Crozie 's gaze . Then remembering the cunning trick that had been used to divert her attention before , she quickly looked back , in time to see the crafty old woman glance between her palms as she snatched her hands behind her back . A knowing smile of grudging respect flitted across the old face . The movement of her shoulders and arm muscles gave the impression of movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpsed one of the bones , and was she exchanging the pieces ? Or did Crozie just want her to think so ? There was more to this game than guessing , Ayla thought , and it was more interesting to play than to watch . Crozie showed her bonyknuckledfists again . Ayla looked at her carefully , not making it obvious . It was n't polite to stare , for one thing , and on a more subtle level , she did n't want Crozie to know what she was looking for . It was hard to tell , the woman was an old hand at the game , but it did seem that the other shoulder was a shade higher , and was n't the other hand pulled in slightly this time ? Ayla chose the hand she thought Crozie wanted her to pick , the wrong one . " Ha ! You lost again ! " Crozie said , elated , then quickly added , " Are you ready ? " Before Ayla could nod in agreement , Crozie had her hands behind her back , and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . Ayla resisted , smiling . The old woman was always changing something , trying to keep from giving any consistent signal . Ayla chose the hand she thought was right , and was rewarded with a mark in the drawing pit . The next time , Crozie changed her position again , lowering her hands , and Ayla guessed wrong . " That 's three ! I win . But you ca n't really test your luck with only one game . Do you want to play another ? " Crozie said . " Yes . Would like to play again , " Ayla said . Crozie smiled , but when Ayla guessed correctly the next two times , her expression was much less agreeable . She frowned as she rubbed the musk-ox knucklebones together a third time . " Look over there ! What 's that ? " Crozie said , pointing with her chin , in a blatant attempt to distract the young woman.  |p319Ayla  looked , and when she looked back , the old woman was smilingagain . The young woman took her time selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided quickly . She did n't want Crozie to feel too upset , but she had learned to interpret the unconscious body signals the woman made when playing the game , and she knew in which hand the plain bone was as clearly as if Crozie had told her . It would not have pleased Crozie to know she was giving herself away so easily , but Ayla had an unusual advantage . She was so accustomed to observing and interpreting subtle details of posture and expression , it was almost instinctive . They were an essential part of the language of the Clan that communicated nuances and shades of meaning . She had noticed that body movements and postures also expressedmeaning among these people who communicated primarily with verbal sounds , but that it was not purposeful . Ayla had been so busy trying to learn the spoken language of her new people she had n't made any real effort to understand their unconsciousunspoken language . Now that she was comfortably , if not precisely , fluent , she could expand her communication to include languageskills that were not normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Crozie made her realize how much she could learn about her own kind of people by applying the knowledge and insight she had learned from the Clan . And if the Clan could not lie because body language was impossible to hide , the ones she had known as the Others could keep secrets from her even less . They did n't even know they were " talking . " She was n't fully able to interpretthe body signals of the Others , yet . . . but she was learning . Ayla chose the hand that held the plain musk-ox knucklebone , and with a jab of irritation , Crozie marked a third line for Ayla . " The luck is yours , now , " she said . " Since I won a game , and you won a game , we might as well call it even and forget the bets . " " No , " Ayla said . " We bet skill . You win my skill . My skill is medicine . I will give you . I want your skill . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at gaming ? That 's what I dobest these days , and you already beat me . What do you want me for ? " " No , not gaming . I want to make white leather , " Ayla said . Crozie gaped in surprise . " White leather ? " " White leather , like tunic you wear at adoption . " " I have n't made white leather in years , " Crozie said . " But you can make ? " Ayla asked . " Yes . " Crozie 's eyes softened with a distant look . " I learned as a girl , frunr my mother . At one time it was sacred to the Hearth of the Crane , or so the legends say . No one else could wear it ... " The oldp320woman 's eyes hardened . " But that was before the Crane Hearth fell into such low esteem that even Bride Price is a pittance . " She looked hard at the young woman . " What is white leather to you ? " " It is beautiful , " Ayla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes again . " And white is sacred to someone , " she finished , looking down at her hands . " I want to make special tunic the way someone likes . Special white tunic . " Ayla did n't notice Crozie glance toward Jondalar , who happened at that moment to be staring at them . He looked aside quickly , seeminglyembarrassed . The old woman shook her head at the young one , whose head was still bowed . " And what do I get for it ? " Crozie said . " You will teach me ? " Ayla said , looking up and smiling . She noticeda gleam of avarice in the old eyes , but something else , too . Something more distant , and softer . " I will make medicine for arthritis , " she said , " like Mamut . " " Who says I need it ? " Crozie snapped . " I 'm not nearly as old as he is . " No , you are not so old , Crozie , but you have pain . You do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know , because I ami medicine woman . Medicine can not cure aching bones and joints , nothing can make it go away , but can make you feel better . Hot poulticewill make easier to move and bend , and I will make medicine for pain , some for morning , some for other times , " Ayla said . Then sensingthe woman needed some way to save face , she added , " I need to make medicine for you , to pay my bet . It is my skill . " " Well , I guess I should let you pay your bet , " Crozie said , " but I want one more thing . " " What ? I will do , if I can . " " I want more of that soft white tallow that makes dry old skin feel smooth . . . and young , " she said , quietly . Then she straightened up and snapped , " My skin always did get chapped in winter . " Ayla smiled . " I will do . Now , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will ask Nezzie what is in cold rooms . " " Deerskin . Reindeer is good , though it is best to use it as a fur , for warmth . Any deer will do , red deer , elk , megaceros . Before you get the hide , though , you will need something else . " " What is that ? " " You will need to save your water . " " My water ? " " The water you pass . Not only yours , anyone 's , though your own is best . Start collecting it now , even before you thaw out a deerskin . It must be left out where it 's warm for a while , " Crozie said.  | " I usually pass water behind the curtain , in the basket with mammothdung and ashes in it . It is thrown out . " " Do n't go in the basket . Save it , in a mammoth skull basin , or a tight basket . Something that wo n't leak . " " Why is that water needed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " I 'm not getting any younger , " she said , finally , " and I have no one , except Fralie . . . any more . Usually a woman passes her skills on to her children and grandchildren but Fralie has no time , and not much interest in working leather  --  she likes stitching and beadwork  --  and she has no daughters . Her sons . . . well , they 're young . Who knows ? But my mother gave me the knowledge , and I should pass it on . . . to someone . It 's hard work , treating hides , but I 've seen your leatherwork . Even the furs and skins you brought show skill , care , and that is necessary to make white leather . I have n't even thought of making it for many years , and no one else has shown much interest , but you asked . So I will tell you . " The woman bent forward and clutched Ayla 's hand . " The secret of white leather is in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is true . After it is left in a warm place for a while , it changes . Then , if you soak hides in it , all the bits of fat that might be left come out , and any grease stains . The hair will come out more quickly , it wo n't rot easily , and it stays soft even without smoking , so it wo n't be tan or brown . In fact , it whitens the hide , still not true white , but close . Afterward , when it is washed and wrung out several times , and worked dry , it is ready for the white color . " If someone had asked her , Crozie could not have explained that urea , which was the major component of urine , would decompose , become ammoniacal , in a warm environment . She only knew that if urine was allowed to go stale , it became something else . Something that would both dissolve grease and act as a bleach , and in the same process , help to preserve the leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , or call it ammonia , she only had to know that it worked . " Chalk . . . do we have any chalk ? " Crozie asked . " Wymez does . He said the flint he just brought back came from a chalk cliff , and he still has several stones coated with it , " Ayla said . " Why did you ask Wymez about chalk ? How did you know I would agree to show you ? " Crozie asked suspiciously . " I did not . I have been wanting to make a white tunic for a long time . If you did not show me , I would try myself , but I did not know about saving the water , and I would not have thought of it . I am happy you will show me to do it right , " Avla said.  | " Hmmf , " was Crozie 's only comment , convinced , but not wanting to admit it . " Be sure you make that soft white tallow . " Then she added , " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be good to mix with the chalk . " Ayla held the drape aside and looked out . The late afternoon wind moaned and keened a dreary dirge , a fitting accompaniment to the drab , bleak landscape and the gray , overcast sky . She longed for some relief from the confining bitter cold , but the oppressive season seemed as though it would never come to an end . Whinney snorted and she turned around to see Mamut coming into the horse hearth . She smiled at him . Ayla had felt a deep respect for the old shaman from the beginning , but since he had begun training her , her respect had grown into love . Partly , she perceived a strong similarity between the tall , thin , incrediblyold shaman , and the short , crippled , one-eyed magician of the Clan , not in appearance but in nature . It was almost as though she had found Creb again , or at least his counterpart . Both exhibited a deep reverence and understanding for the world of the spirits , though the spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , though each was physically frail ; and both were wise in the ways of people . But perhaps the strongest reason for her love was that , like Creb , Mamut had welcomed her , helped her to understand , and taken her in as a daughter of his hearth . " I was looking for you , Ayla . I thought you might be here , with your horses , " Mamut said . " I was looking outside , wishing it was spring , " Ayla said . " This is the time most people start wishing for a change , for something new to do or see . They are getting bored , sleeping more . I think that 's why we have more feasts and celebrations in the last part of winter . The Laughing Contest will be coming soon . Most people enjoythat one . " " What is the Laughing Contest ? " " Just what it sounds like . Everyone tries to make everyone else laugh . Some people wear funny clothes , or wear their clothes backward , make funny faces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , play tricks on each other . And if anyone gets angry about it , they get laughed at all the more . Almost everyone looks forward to it , but no celebration is as eagerly anticipated as the Spring Festival . In fact , that 's why I was looking for you , " Mamut said . " There are still many things you should learn before then . " " Why is the Spring Festival so special ? " Ayla was n't sure she was anticipating it.  | " For many reasons , I suppose . It is both our most solemn and our happiest celebration . It marks the end of the long deep cold , and the beginning of warmth . It is said that if you watch the cycle of seasons one year , you will understand life . Most people count three seasons . Spring is the season of birth . In the gush of Her birth waters , the spring floods , the Great Earth Mother brings forth new life again . Summer , the warm season , is the time of growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spring , life is renewed again , reborn . Three seasons are enough for most purposes , but the Mammoth Hearth counts five . The Mother 's sacred number is five . " In spite of her initial reservations , Ayla found herself fascinated by the training Mamut had insisted upon . She was learning so much : new ideas , new thoughts , even new ways of thinking . It was exciting to discover and think about so many new things , to be included insteadof excluded . Knowledge of spirits , knowledge of numbers , even knowledge of hunting , had been kept from her when she had lived with the Clan ; it was reserved for the men . Only mog-urs and their acolytes studied them in depth , and no woman could become a mogur . Women were not even admitted to discussions about such conceptsas spirits or numbers . Hunting had been taboo for her , too , but they did n't bar women from listening ; they had just assumed no woman could learn . " I would like to go over the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin showing you something special . Symbols . I think you will find them interesting . Some are about medicine . " " Medicine symbols ? " Ayla asked . Of course she was interested . They walked into the Mammoth Hearth together . " Are you going to do anything with the white leather ? " Mamut asked , putting mats by the fire near his bed . " Or are you going to save it , like the red ? " " I do n't know about the red yet , but I want to make a special tunic with the white . I am learning to sew , but I feel very clumsy . It turned out so perfect , I do n't want to spoil the white until I get better. ) cegie is showing me , and Fralie , sometimes , when Frebec does n't snake it difficult for her . " Ayla slivered some bone and added it to the flames while Mamut brought out a rather thin oval section of ivory with a large curved surface . The oval outline had been etched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated until it was a deep groove . A sharp blow accurately placed at one end detached the flake of ivory . Mamut licked out a piece of bone charcoal from the fire as Ayla got a mammothskull and a hammer-shaped drumstick made of antler and sat down beside hint.  | " Before we practice with the drum , I want to show you certain symbols that we use to help us memorize things , like songs , stories , proverbs , places , times , names , anything that someone wants to remember , " Mamut began . " You have been teaching us hand signals and signs , and I know you 've noticed that we use certain gestures , too , though not as many as the Clan . We wave goodbye and beckon to someone if we want him to come , and it is understood . We use other hand symbols , particularly when we are describing something , or tellinga story , or when One Who Serves is conducting a ceremony . Here is one that will be easy . It is similar to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , palm facing outward . " That means all , ' everyone , everything , " he explained , then picked up the charcoal . " Now , I can make the same motion with this piece of charcoal on the ivory , see ? " he said , drawing a circle . " Now that symbolmeans all ' and any time you see it , even if it is drawn by another Mamut , you will know it means ' all . " The old shaman enjoyed teaching Ayla . She was bright and quick to learn , but even more , her pleasure at learning was so transparent . Her face showed her feelings as he explained , her curiosity and interest , and her sheer wonder when she comprehended . " I never would have thought of that ! Can anyone learn this knowledge ? " she asked . " Some knowledge is sacred , and only those pledged to the MammothHearth may be told , but most things can be learned by anyone who shows an interest . It often turns out that those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sacred knowledge is often hidden behind a second meaning , or even a third meaning . Most people know this "  --  he drew another circle on the ivory  --  " means all , ' but it has another meaning . There are many symbols for the Great Mother , this is one of them . It means Mut , the Creator of All Life . Many other lines and shapes have meaning , " he continued . " This means water , " he said , drawing a zigzag line . " That was on the map , when we hunted the bison , " she said . " I think it meant river . " " Yes , it can mean river . How it is drawn , or where it is drawn , or what it is drawn with can change the meaning . If it is like this , " he said , making another zigzag with some additional lines , " it means the water is not drinkable . And like the circle , it has a second meaning . It is the symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hate . It can also be a reminder for a saying we have : the river runs silent when the water is deep . " Ayla frowned , sensing some meaning for her in the saying . " Most Healers give the symbols meanings to help them remember ,  |p325like  reminders for sayings , except the sayings are about medicine or healing , and are not usually understood by anyone else , " Mamut said . " I do n't know many of them , but when we go to the Summer Meeting , you will meet other Healers . They can tell you more . " Ayla was interested . She remembered meeting other medicine women at the Clan Gathering , and how much she had learned from them . They had shared their treatments and remedies , even taught her new rhythms , but best of all was having other people to share experiences with . " I would like to learn more , " she said . " I know only Clan medicine . " " I think you have more knowledge than you know , Ayla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , at first . Some could learn from you , but I hope you understand that it may take some time before you are completely accepted . " The old man watched her frown again , and wished there was some way he could ease her initial introduction . He could think of several reasons why it would not be easy for her to meet other Mamutoi , especially in large numbers . But no need to worry about that yet , he thought , and shifted the subject . " There is something about Clan medicine I 'd like to ask you . Is it all just the memories ' ? Or do you have ways to help you remember ? " " How plants look , in seed , and shoot , and ripe ; where they grow ; what they are good for ; how to mix , prepare and use them ; that is from memory . Other kinds of treatments are remembered , too . I think about a new way to use something , but that is because I know how to use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any symbols or reminders ? " Ayla thought for a moment , then , smiling , got up and brought back her medicine bag . She dumped out the contents in front of her , an assortment of small pouches and packets carefully tied with cords and small thongs . She picked up two of them . " This one has mint , " she said , showing Mamut one , " and this one has rose hips . " " How do you know ? You have n't opened them , or smelled them . " " I know because mint has a cord made from the stringy bark of a certain bush , and there are two knots on one end of the cord . The cord on the packet of rose hips is from the long hair of a horse tail , and it has three knots in a row , close together , " Ayla said . " I can smell difference , too  --  if I do n't have a cold , but some very strong medicine has little smell . It is mixed with strong-smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be used . Differentcord , different knots , different smell , sometimes different packet . They are reminders , right ? " " Clever . . . very clever , " Manua- said . " Yes , they are reminders.  |p326But  you have to remember the cords and the knots for each one , do n't you ? Still , it 's a good way to make sure you are using the proper medicine . " Ayla 's eyes were open , but she lay still and did n't move . It was dark except for the dim nightlight of banked fires . Jondalar was just climbing into bed , trying to make as little disturbance as possible as he moved around her . She had thought of moving to the inside once , but decided against it . She did n't want to make it easy for him to slip quietly in and out of bed . He rolled up in his separate furs and lay on his side , facing the wall , unmoving . She knew he did not go to sleep quickly , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been rebuffed before and did n't want to chance it again . It had hurt when he said he was tired or pretended to be asleep , or did not respond to her . Jondalar waited until the sound of her breathing indicated that she had finally fallen off to sleep . Then he quietly rolled over , got up on an elbow and filled his eyes with the sight of her . Her tousled hair was strewn across the furs , and one arm was flung outside the covers , baring a breast . A warmth emanated from her and a faint womanscent . He could feel himself shaking with wanting to touch her , but he felt certain she would n't want him bothering her when she was sleeping . After his confused and angry reaction to her night with Ranec , he feared she did n't want him any more . Lately , every time they accidentally brushed together , she flinched back . Several times he 'd considered moving to a different bed , even a different hearth , but as difficult as it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep away from her . A wispy tendril of hair lay across her face and moved with each breath she took . He reached over and gently moved it aside , then carefully lowered himself back down to the bed , and allowed himself to relax . He closed his eyes and fell asleep to the sound of her breathing . Ayla awoke with the feeling that someone was looking at her . The fires were built up and daylight was coming in through the partially uncovered fireplace hole . She turned her head to see Ranec 's dark intense eyes quietly watching her from the Fox Hearth . She smiled sleepily at him , and was rewarded with a big , delighted smile . She was sure the place beside her would be empty , but she reached across the piled-up furs just to make sure . Then she pushed back her covers and sat up . She knew Ranec would wait until she was up and dressed before coming into the Mammoth Hearth to visit.  |p327It  had made her uncomfortable when she first became aware that he watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering and she knew there was no malice in his attention , but within the Clan , it wag considereddiscourteous to stare across the boundary stones into another family 's living area . There had been no more real privacy in the cave of the clan than there was in the earthlodge of the Mamutoi , but Ranec 's attention felt like a mild intrusion upon her privacy  --  such as it was  --  and accentuated an undercurrent of tension she felt . Someone was always around . It had been no different when she lived with the clan , but these were people whose ways she had not grown up with . The differences were often subtle , but in the close proximity of the earthlodge , they were heightened , or she was more sensitive to them . Occasionally , she wished she could get away . After three years of loneliness in the valley , she never imagined the time would come when she would wish to be alone , but there were times when she longed for the solitude , and the freedom , of loneliness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few bites from the food left over from the night before . The open smoke holes usually meant it was clear outside , and she decided to go out with the horses . When she pushed aside the drape that led to the annex , she saw Jondalar and Danug with the horses , and paused to reconsider . Tending to the needs of the horses , either inside the annex , or when the weather allowed , outside , gave her some respite from people when she wanted a moment to herself , but Jondalar also seemed to like to spend time with them . When she saw him with them , she often stayed away because he left them to her whenever she joined them , with mumbled comments about not wanting to interfere in her time with her horses . She wanted to allow him time with the animals . Not only did they provide a connection between her and Jondalar , their mutual care of the horses required communication , however reserved . His desire to be with them and sensitivity toward them made her think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Ayla went on into the horse hearth . Perhaps with Danug there , Jondalar would n't be so quick to leave . As she approached them , he was already backing away , but she rushed to say something that would keep him engaged in conversation . " Have you thought , yet , about how you are going to teach Racer , Jondalar ? " Ayla asked . She smiled a greeting at Danug. ' leach him what ? " Jondalar asked , a little disconcerted by her question . " ' Leach him to let you ride him . " He had been thinking about it . In fact , he had just been making ap328comment to Danug , in what he hoped was a casual way . He did n't want to betray his increasingly strong desire to ride the animal . Particularlywhen he felt thwarted by his inability to deal with Ayla 's apparent attraction to Ranec , he imagined himself galloping across the steppes on the back of the brown stallion , as free as the wind , but he was n't sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride Whinney 's colt , now . " I have thought about it , but I did n't know if . . . how to begin , " Jondalar said . " I think you should keep doing what we started in the valley . Get him used to things on his back . Get him used to carrying loads . I 'm not sure how to teach him to go where you want him to go . He will follow on a rope , but I do n't know how he can follow a rope when you are on his back , " Ayla said , talking fast , making suggestions on the spur of the moment , trying to keep him involved . Danug watched her , then Jondalar , wishing he could say or do something that would suddenly make everything right , not only betweenthem , but for everyone . An awkward moment of silence settled uneasily around them when Ayla stopped speaking . Danug rushed to fill the gap . " Maybe he could hold the rope from behind , while he 's sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane , " the young man said . Suddenly , as though someone had struck a piece of flint with iron pyrite in the dark lodge , Jondalar could visualize exactly what Danug had said . Instead of backing away , looking as though he was ready to sprint off at the first opportunity , Jondalar closed his eyes and wrinkledhis forehead in concentration . " You know , that might work , Danug ! " he said . Caught up in his excitement about an idea that might be a solution to a problem he had been worrying about , he forgot for a moment his uncertainty about his future . " Perhaps I could fasten something to his halter and hold it from behind . A strong cord . . . or a thin leather strap . . . two of them , maybe . " " I have some narrow thongs , " Ayla said , noticing that he seemed less strained . She was pleased about his continuing interest in training the young stallion , and curious how it might work . " I will get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her through the inner arch into the Mammoth Hearth . Then stopped suddenly as she went to the storage platform to get the thong . Ranec was talking to Deegie and Tronie , and turned to flash his winning smile at Ayla . Jondalar felt his stomach churn , closed his eyes and gritted his teeth . He started edging back toward the opening . Ayla turned to give him a narrow roll of flexible leather.  | " This is lashing , it is strong , " she said , giving it to him . " I made it last winter . " She looked up into the troubled blue eyes that revealed the pain , the confusion , and the indecision that tormented him . " Beforeyou came to my valley , Jondalar . Before the Spirit of the Great Cave Lion chose you , and led you there . " He took the roll and hurried out . He could n't stay . Whenever the carver came to the Mammoth Hearth , he had to leave . He could n't be nearby when the dark man and Ayla were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched from a distance when the younger people gathered in the larger space of the ceremonial area to spread out their work , share ideas and skills . He heard them practice music and sing , listened to their jokes and laughter . And every time he heard Ayla 's laughter coupled with Ranec 's , he winced . Jondalar put the roll of lashing down near the young animal 's halter , took his parka from the peg in the annex , and went outside , smiling bleakly at Danug on his way . He slipped it over his head , pulled the hood tight around his face , and stuffed his hands in the mittens dangling from the sleeves , then walked up to the steppes . The strong wind blowing a gray rack across the sky was no more than normal for the season , and the sun shining intermittently between the high broken clouds seemed to have little effect on the temperaturethat remained well below freezing . The snow cover was scant , and the dry air crackled and stole moisture from his lungs in clouds of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the cold calmed him with its insistent demand to put survival ahead of every other consideration . He did n't know why he reacted so strongly to Ranec . Part of it , without doubt , was his fear of losing Ayla to him , and part was visualizing them together in his imagination , but there was also a nagging guilt about his own hesitation in accepting her fully and without reservation . Part of him believed Ranec deservedher more than he did . But one thing at least seemed certain . Ayla wanted him and not Ranec to try to learn to ride Racer . Danug watched Jondalar start up the slope , then let the drape fall hack , and walked slowly back inside . Racer neighed and tossed his head as the young man walked past , and Danug looked at the horse and smiled . Nearly everyone seemed to enjoy the animals now , pattingand talking to them , though not with Ayla 's familiarity . It seemed so natural to have horses in an annex of the lodge . How easy it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time he had seen them . He passed through the second archway , and saw Avla standing beside her bed platform . He paused , then joined her. " lie 's taking a walk on the steppes , " he said to Ayla . " It 's not ap330good idea to go out alone when it 's cold and windy , but it 's not as bad out as it can be sometimes . " " Are you trying to tell me he will be all right , Danug ? " Ayla smiled at him , and he felt foolish for a moment . Of course Jondalar would be all right . He had traveled far , he could take care of himself . " Thank you , " she said , " for your help , and for wanting to help , " reaching over and touching his hand . Her hand was cool , but her touch warm , and he felt it with that special intensity she aroused in him , but on a Ileeper level , he felt that she had offered something more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check some snares I set , " he said . " Try it this way , Ayla , " Deegie said . Deftly , she poked a hole near the edge of the leather with a small bone , a hard , tough bone from the leg of an arctic fox which had a natural sharp point , that had been made even sharper with sandstone . Then she laid a fine piece of sinew thread over the hole , and with the point of the sewing awl , pushed it through the hole . She grabbed it with her fingers from the back side of the leather and pulled the sinew through . At a corresponding place on another piece of leather which she was sewing to the first piece , she made another hole and repeated the process . Ayla took the practice pieces of leather back . Using a square of tough mammoth skin as a thimble , she pushed the sharp arctic fox bone through the leather , making a small perforation . Then she tried to lay the thin sinew over the hole and push it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique , and again felt thoroughly frustrated . " I do n't think I 'll ever learn this , Deegie ! " she wailed . " You just have to practice , Ayla . I 've been doing this since I was a girl . Of course it 's easy for me , but you 'll get it , if you keep trying . It 's the same idea as cutting a little slit with a flint point and pulling leather lashing through to make working clothes , and you can do that just fine . " " But it is much harder to do with fine sinew and tiny holes . I ca n't get the sinew to go through . I feel so clumsy ! I do n't know how Tronie can sew on beads and quills like she does , " Ayla said , looking at Fralie , who was rolling a long thin cylinder of ivory in the groove of a block of sandstone . " I was hoping she would show me , so I could decorate the white tunic after I made it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it the way I want . " " You will , Ayla . I do n't think there is anything you ca n't do if you really want to , " Tronie said.  | " Except sing ! " Deegie said . Everyone laughed , including Ayla . Though her speaking voice was low-pitched and pleasant , singing was not one of her gifts . She could maintain a limited range of tones sufficient for the lulling monotony of a chant , and she did have an ear for music . She knew when she was off and she could whistle a melody , but any facility of voice was beyondher . The virtuosity of someone like Barzec was sheer wonder . She could listen to him all day , if he would consent to sing so long . Fralie , too , had a fine , clear , high , sweet voice , which Ayla loved to hear . In fact , most members of the Lion Camp could sing , but not Ayla . Jokes were made about her singing and her voice , which included comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than accent . She laughed as much as anyone . She could n't sing and she knew it , and if they joked about her voice , many people had also , individually , praised her speech . They took it as a compliment that she had become so fluent in their language , so fast , and the joking about her singing made her feel that she belonged . Everyone had some trait or characteristic that the others poked fun at : Talut 's size , Ranec 's color , Tulie 's strength . Only Frebec took offense , so they joked about that behind his back , in sign language . The Lion Camp had also become fluent , without even thinking about it , in a modified version of the language of the Clan . As a result , Ayla was n't the only one feeling the warmth of acceptance . Rydag , too , was included in the fun . Ayla glanced toward him . He was sitting on a mat with Hartal on his lap , keeping the active baby occupied with a pile of bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling after his mother and scatter-the beads she was helping Fralie make . Rydag was good with the babies . He had the patience to play with them and entertain them as lung as they wished . He smiled at her . " You not only one can not sing , Ayla , " he signed . She smiled back . No , she thought , she was not the only one who could not sing . Rydag could not sing . Or talk . Or run and play . Or even live out a full life . In spite of her medicine , she did n't know how lung he would live . He could die that day , or he could survive severalears . She could only love him each day that he lived , and hope she could love him the next . " Hartal can not sing , either ! " he signaled , and laughed with his odd guttural laugh . Ayla chuckled , shaking her head with bemused delight . He had known what she was thinking , and made a joke about it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched them . Maybe you do not sing , Rydag , but you can talk now , she thought . He was stringing several vertebrae on a heavy cord through the spinal cord hole , and rattling them together for the baby . Without the hand-signal words , and the increased awareness they had brought of Rydag 's intelligence and understanding , he would never have been allowed the responsibility of tending Hartal so his mother could work , not even right beside her . What a difference Ayla had brought to Rydag 's life . This winter , no one questioned his essential humanity , except Frebec , and Nezzie was sure that was more out of stubbornness than belief . Ayla continued to struggle with the awl and sinew . If she could only get the fine threads of sinew to go into the hole and out the other side . She tried to do it the way Deegie had shown her , but it was a knack that came from years of experience , and she was a long way from that . She dropped the practice pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others making ivory beads . A sharp blow to a mammoth tusk at the proper angle caused a fairly thin , curved section to flake off . Grooves were cut in the large flake with chisellike burins by etching a line and retracing it several times until the long pieces broke off . They were shaved and whittled into rough cylinders with scrapers and knives that peeled off long curled slivers , then they were rubbed smooth with sandstone kept wet to be more abrasive . Sharp flint blades , given a sawtooth edge and hafted to a long handle , were used to saw the ivory cylinders into small sections , and then the edges of them were smoothed . The final step was to make a hole in the center , to string them on a cord , or to sew them to a garment . It was done with a special tool . Flint , carefully shaped into a long thin point by a skilled toolmaker , was inserted into the end of a long narrow rod , perfectly straight and smooth . The point of the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory and then , similar to the process of making fire , the rod was rotated back and forth between the palms while exerting downwardpressure , until a hole was bored through . Ayla watched Tronie twirl the rod between her palms , concentrating on making the hole just right . It occurred to her that they were going to a lot of work to make something that had no apparent use . Beads were no help in the securing or preparing of food , and they did not make the clothing , to which they were attached , more useful . But she began to understand why the beads had such value . The Lion Camp could never have afforded such an investment of time and effort without the security of warmth and comfort , and the assurance of adequate food . Only a cooperative , well-organized group could plan and store enough necessities ahead to assure the leisure to make beads.  |p333Therefore  , the more beads they wore , the more it showed that the Lion Camp was a flourishing , desirable place to live , and the more respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She picked up the leather in her lap and the bone awl , and made the last hole she had made a little bigger , then she tried to poke the sinew through the hole with the awl . She got it through , and pulled it from the back , but it did n't have the neat look of Deegie 's tight stitches . She glanced up again , discouraged , and watched Rydag thread a backbone segment on a rope through the natural hole of its spinal cord . He picked up another vertebra and poked the rather stiff rope through its hole . Ayla took a deep breath , and picked up her work again . It was n't so hard forcing the point through the leather , she thought . She almost pushed the whole bone through the hole . If only she could attach the thread to it , she thought , it would be easy . . . . She stopped and examined the small bone carefully . Then she looked at Rydag tying the ends of the rope together and shaking the backbone rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her palms , then turned to look at Fralie smoothing an ivory cylinder in the groove in a small block of sandstone . Then she closed her eyes , recalling Jondalar making spear points out of bone in her valley the previous summer . . . . She looked at the bone-sewing awl again . " Deegie ! " she cried . " What ? " the young woman answered , startled . " I think I know a way to do it ! " " Do what ? " " Get the sinew to go through the hole . Why not put a hole through the back end of a bone with a sharp point and then put the thread through the hole ? Like Rydag put that rope through those backbones . Then , you can push it all the way through the leather and the thread will follow it . What do you think ? Would it work ? " Ayla asked . Deegie closed her eyes for a moment , then took the awl from Ayla and looked it over . " It would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tronie is making in those beads are small . Would it have to be much smaller ? " " This hone is very hard , and tough . It would not be easy to make a hole in it , and I do n't see a good place for a hole . " " Could n't we make something out of mammoth tusk , or some other kind of bone ? Jondalar makes long , narrow spear points out of bone , and smooths and sharpens them with sandstone , like Fralie is doing. could n't we make something like a tiny spear point , and then drill a hole in the other end ? " Avla asked , tense with excitement . Decgic considered again . " We 'd have to get Wyniez or someone top334make a smaller drill , but . . . it might work . Ayla , I think it might work ! " Nearly everyone seemed to be milling around the Mammoth Hearth . They were gathered together in groups of three or four , chatting , but expectancy was in the air . Word had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new thread-puller . Several people had worked on developing it , but since it had been her idea originally , Ayla was going to be the first to use it . Wymez and Jondalar had worked together to devise a way to make a flint borer small enough to make the hole . Ranec had selected the ivory , and using his carving tools , had shaped several very small , long , pointed cylinders . Ayla had smoothed and sharpened them to her satisfaction , but Tronie had actually bored the hole . Ayla could sense the excitement . When she got out the practice leather and the sinew , everyone gathered around , all pretense that they were only casually visiting forgotten . The hard , dry deer tendon , brown as old leather and as big around as a finger , resembled a stick of wood . It was pounded until it became a bundle of white collagen fibers that separated easily into filaments of sinew , which could be coarse strings or thin , fine thread depending upon what was wanted . She felt the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally pulled a thin filament away . She wet it with her mouth to soften it , and bind it together , then holding the threadpullerin her left hand , she examined the small hole critically . This could be difficult , getting the thread through the hole . The sinew was starting to dry , and harden slightly , which made it easier . Ayla carefullypoked the sinew thread into the tiny hole , and breathed a small sigh of relief when she pulled it through , and held up the ivory sewingpoint with thread dangling from the end . Next she picked up the piece of worn leather she was using for practice , and near an edge , she jabbed in the point , making a perforation . But this time she pushed it through , and smiled when she saw it pulling the thread after itself . She held it up to show , to exclamations of wonder . Then she picked up another piece of leather that she wanted to attach , and repeated the process , though she had to use the square of mammoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker , tougher hide . She pulled the two pieces together , and then made a second stitch , and held the two pieces up to show . " It works ! " Ayla said , with a big smile of victory . She gave the leather and needle to Deegie , who made a few stitches . " It does work . Here , Mother , you try it , " she said , handing the leather and the thread-puller to the headwoman.  |p335Tulie  also took a few stitches and nodded approvingly , then gave it to Nezzie , who tried it out , then let Tronie take a turn . Tronie gave it to Ranec , who tried pushing the point through both pieces at once , and discovered that thick leather was hard to penetrate . " I think if you made a small cutting point out of flint , " he said as he passed it to Wymez , " it would make it easier to poke this through heavy leather . What do you think ? " Wymez tried it and nodded agreement . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in the Camp tried the new implement , and agreed . It did make sewing much easier to have something that pulled , rather than pushed , the thread through . Talut held the small sewing tool up and examined it from all angles , nodding his head with admiration . A long slender shaft , point at one end , hole at the other , it was an invention whose worth was recognizedinstantly . He wondered why no one had thought of it sooner . It was simple , so obvious once it was seen , but so effective.  |p336Two  sets of hooves pounded in unison across the hard ground . Ayla crouched low over the mare 's withers , squinting into a wind burning cold on her face . She rode lightly , the controlling interplay of tension in her knees and hips in perfect accord with the powerful , striving muscles of the galloping horse . She noticed a change in the rhythm of the other hoofbeats , and glanced at Racer . He had pulled ahead but , showing unmistakable signs of tiring , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the young stallion halted , as well . Enveloped in clouds of steam from their hard breathing , the horses hung their heads . Both animals were tired , but it had been a good run . Sitting upright and bouncing easily in rhythm with the horse 's gait , Ayla headed back toward the river at a comfortable pace , enjoying the opportunity to be outside . It was cold , but beautiful , with the glare of an incandescent sun made brighter by sparkling ice and the white of a recent blizzard . As soon as Ayla had stepped outside the earthlodge that morning , she decided to take the horses for a long run . The air itself enticed her out . It seemed lighter , as though an oppressive burden had been lifted . She thought the cold was not as intense , though nothing was visibly changed . The ice was just as frozen , the tiny pellets of winddrivensnow just as hard . Ayla had no absolute means of knowing that the temperature had risen and the wind blew with less force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been interpreted as intuition , a feeling , it was in reality an acute sensitivity . To people who lived in climates of extreme cold , conditions even a little less severe were noticeable , and often greeted with exuberant good feelings . It was n't yet spring , but the relentless grip of the deep grinding cold had eased , and the slight but noticeable warming brought with it the promise that life would stir again . She smiled when the young stallion pranced ahead , his neck arched proudly and his tail held out . She still thought of Racer as the baby she had helped deliver , but he was n't a baby any more . " Though stillp337not filled out completely , he was bigger than his dam , and he was a racer . He loved to run , and he was fast , but there was a difference in the running patterns of the two horses . Racer was invariably faster than his dam in a short run , easily outdistancing her at the start , but Whinney had more endurance . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any distance , she inevitably caught up and surged ahead of him . Ayla dismounted , but stopped momentarily before pushing aside the drape and entering the earthlodge . She 'd often used the horses as an excuse to get away , and on that morning she had been particularly relieved that the weather felt right for a long run . As happy as she was to have found people again , and to be accepted as one of them and included in their activities , she needed to be alone occasionally . It was especially true when uncertainties and unresolved **27;13961;TOOLONG tensions . Fralie had been spending much of her time at the Mammoth Hearth with the young people , to Frebec 's growing annoyance . Ayla had been hearing arguments from the Crane Hearth , or rather , harangues by Frebec complaining of Fralie 's absence . She knew he did n't like Fralie to associate too closely with her , and was sure the pregnant woman would stay away more to keep the peace . It bothered Ayla , particularly since Fralie had just confided that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could lose the baby if she did n't rest , and promised her some medicine , but now it would be more difficult to treat her with Frebec hovering disapprovingly . Added to that was her growing confusion about Jondalar and Ranec . Jondalar had been distant , but recently he seemed more like himself . A few days before , Mamut had asked him to come and talk to him about a particular tool he had in mind , but the shaman had been busy all day , and only found time to discuss his project in the evening , when the young people usually gathered at the Mammoth Hearth . Though they sat quietly off to the side , the laughter and usual banter were easily overheard . Ranec was more attentive than ever , and had been pressing Ayla lately , in the guise of teasing and joking , to come to his bed again . She still found it difficult to refuse him outright ; acquiescence to a man 's wishes had been too thoroughly ingrained in her to overcome easily . tike laughed at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the serious intent it sometimes masked  --  but skillfully evaded his implied invitation , to a chorus of laughter at Ranec 's expense . I le laughed as well , enjoying her wit , and she felt attracted to his easy friendliness . I lc was comfortable to he with . Mamut noticed that Jondalar smiled , too , and nodded his head ap/provingly . The flint knapper had avoided the gathering of young people , only watching the friendly joking from a distance , and the laughter had only increased his jealousy . He did n't know that it was often sparked by Ayla 's refusals of Ranec 's offers , though Mamut did . The next day , Jondalar smiled at her , for the first time in too long , Ayla thought , but she felt her breath catch in her throat and her heart speed up . During the next few days , he began coming back to the hearth earlier , not always waiting until she was asleep . Though she was reluctant to push herself on him still , and he seemed hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was getting over whatever had been bothering him . Yet she was afraid to hope . Ayla took a deep breath , then pulled back the heavy drape , and held it aside for the horses . After shaking out her parka and hanging it on a peg , she went inside . For a change , the Mammoth Hearth was nearly empty . Only Jondalar was there , talking to Mamut . She was pleased , but surprised to see him , and it made her realize how little she had seen of him lately . She smiled and hurried toward them , but Jondalar 's scowl pulled down the corners of her mouth . He did not seem very happy to see her . " You 've been gone all morning , alone ! " he blurted . " Do n't you know it 's dangerous to go out alone ? You worry people . Soon someonewould have had to go looking for you . " He did n't say he had been the one who was worried , or that he was the one who was considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his vehemence . " I was not alone . I was with Whinney and Racer . I took them for a run . They needed it . " " Well , you should n't have gone out like that when it 's so cold . It is dangerous to go out alone , " he said , rather lamely , glancing at Mamut , hoping for support . " I said I was not alone . I was with Whinney and Racer , and it is nice out , sunny , not as cold . " She was flustered by his anger , not realizing that it masked a fear for her safety that was almost unbearable . " I have been out alone in winter before , Jondalar . Who do you think went out with me when I lived in the valley ? " She 's right , he thought . She knows how to take care of herself . I should n't keep trying to tell her when and where she can go . Mamut did not seem overly concerned when he had asked where Ayla was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should have paid more attention to the old shaman , Jondalar thought , feeling foolish , as though he had made a scene over nothing . " Uh . . . well . . . maybe I should go look at the horses , " he mumbled , backing away and hurrying toward the annex.  |p339Ayla  watched him go , wondering if he thought she was n't looking after them . She was confused and upset . It seemed impossible to understand him at all . Mamut was watching her closely . Her hurt and distress were plain to see . Why was it that the people who were involved found it so hard to understand their own problems ? He was inclined to confront them and force them to see what seemed obvious to everyone else , but he resisted . He had already done as much as he felt he should . He had sensed from the beginning an undercurrent of tension in the Zelandoniiman , and was convinced that the problem was not as obvious as it seemed . It was best to let them work it out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if left to find their own solutions . But he could encourage Ayla to talk to him about it or , at least , help her to discover her choices , and know her own wishes and potential . " Did you say it is not as cold out , Ayla ? " Mamut asked . It took a moment for the question to find its way through the maze of other pressing thoughts that worried her . " What ? Oh . . . yes . I think so . It does n't really feel warmer , it just does n't seem as cold . " " I was wondering when She would break the back of winter , " Mamut said . " I thought it should be getting close . " " Break the back ? I do not understand . " " It 's just a saying , Ayla . Sit down , I 'll tell you a winter story about the Great Bountiful Earth Mother who created all that lives , " the old man said , smiling . Ayla sat beside him on a mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth Mother took a life force from Chaos , which is a cold and unmoving emptiness , like death , and from it She created life and warmth , but She must always fight for the life She created . When the cold season is coming on , we know the struggle has begun between the Bountiful Earth Mother who wants to bring forth warm life , and cold death of Chaos , but first She must care for Her children . " Ayla was warming to the story , now , and smiled encouragingly . " What does She do to care for Her children ? " " Some She puts to sleep , some She dresses warmly to resist the cold , some She bids gather food and hide . As it gets colder and colder , death seems to be winning , the Mother is pushed back farther and farther . In the depths of the cold season , when the Mother is locked in the battle of life and death , nothing moves , nothing changes , everything seems to be dead . For us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stored , death would win in winter ; sometimes , if the battle goes on longer than usual , it does . No one goes out much , then . People stake things , or tell stories , or talk , but they do n't movep340around much and they sleep more . That 's why winter is called the little death . " Finally , when the cold has pushed Her down as far as She will go , She resists . She pushes and pushes until She breaks the back of winter . It means spring will return but it is not spring , yet . She has had a long fight , and She must rest before She can bring forth life again . But you know She has won . You can smell it , you can feel it in the air . " " I did ! I did feel it , Mamut ! That 's why I had to take the horses for a run . The Mother broke the back of winter ! " Ayla exclaimed . The story seemed to explain exactly how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a celebration , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes . I think so ! " " Perhaps you would be willing to help me arrange it ? " He waited only long enough for Ayla to nod . " Not everyone feels Her victory , yet , but they will soon . We can both watch for the signs , and then decide when the time is right . " " What signs ? " " As life begins to stir again , each person feels it in a different way . Some get happy and want to go outside , but it 's still too cold to go out very much , so they get edgy , or irritated . They want to acknowledge the life stirrings within them , but there are many big storms yet to come . Winter knows all is lost and gets angriest at this time of year , and people feel it and get angry , too . I 'm glad you have alerted me . Between now and spring , people will be more restless . I think you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best . It gives people a reason to express happiness instead of anger . " I knew she would notice , Mamut thought , when he saw her frown . I have barely begun to feel the difference , and she has recognized it already . I knew she was gifted , but her abilities still astound me , and I 'm sure I have not yet discovered her full range . I may never know ; her potential could be far greater than mine . What did she say about that root , and the ceremony with the mog-urs ? I 'd like to get her prepared . . . the hunting ceremony with the Clan ! It changed me , the effects were profound . It lives with me still . She , too , had an experience . . . could that have changed her ? Enhanced her natural tendencies ? I wonder . . . the Spring Festival , is it too soon to bring up the root again ? Maybe I should wait until after she works with me on the Back Breaking Celebration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be many between now and spring . . . . Deegie walked down the passageway toward the Mammoth Hearth carrying heavy outer wear.  | " I was hoping I would find you , Ayla . I want to check those snares I set to see if I caught any white foxes to trim Branag 's parka . Do you want to come with me ? " Ayla , just waking up , looked up at the partially uncovered smoke hole . " It does look nice out . Let me get dressed . " She pulled back the covers , sat up , stretched and yawned , then went to the curtained-off area near the horse annex . On her way , she passed by a platform bed on which a half-dozen children were sleeping , sprawled on top of each other in a heap , like a litter of wolf pups . She saw Rydag 's large brown eyes open , and smiled at him . He closed them again , and snuggled down between the youngest , Nuvie , almost four years , and Rugie , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in the pile , and lately , she had seen Fralie 's youngest , Tasher , who was not yet three , beginning to take notice of the other youngsters . Latie , verging on womanhood , Ayla noticed , played with them less and less . The children were benevolently spoiled . They could eat and sleep where and when they wanted . They seldom observed the territorial customs of their elders ; the entire lodge was theirs . They could demandthe attention of adult members of the Camp , and often found it was welcomed as an interesting diversion ; no one was in any particularhurry or had anyplace to go . Wherever their interests led the children , an older member of the group was ready to assist or explain . If they wanted to sew skins together , they were given the tools , and scraps of leather , and strings of sinew . If they wanted to make stone tools , they were given pieces of flint , and stone or bone hammers . They wrestled and tumbled , and invented games , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small hearths , and learned to use fire . They pretended to hunt , spearing pieces of meat from the cold storage chambers , and cooked it . When playing " hearths " extended to mimicking the copulating activities of their elders , the adults smiled indulgently . No part of normal living was singledout as something to be hidden or repressed ; all of it was necessary instruction to becoming an adult . The only taboo was violence , particularly extreme or unnecessary violence . Living so closely together , they had learned that nothing could destroya Camp , or a people , like violence , particularly when they were confined to the earthlodge during the long , cold winters . Whether by accident or design , every custom , manner , convention , or practice , even if not overtly directed at it , was aimed at keeping violence to a minimum . Sanctioned conduct allowed a wide range of individual differencesin activities that did not , as a rule , lead to violence , or that might he acceptable outlets for draining off strong emotions . Personalp342skills were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while understood , was discouraged . Competitions , including arguments , were actively used as alternatives , but were ritualized , strictly controlled , and kept within defined boundaries . The children quickly learned the basic rules . Yelling was acceptable ; hitting was not . As Ayla checked the large waterbag , she smiled again at the sleepingchildren , who had been up until late the night before . She enjoyed having children around again . " I should get snow before we leave . We are low on water , and it has n't snowed for a while . Clean snow nearby is getting hard to find . " " Let 's not take the time , " Deegie said . " We have water at our hearth , and so does Nezzie . We can get more when we come back . " She was putting on her warm winter outdoor clothes while Ayla was dressing . " I have a waterbag , and some food to take with us , so if you 're not hungry , we can just go . " " I can wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot tea , " Ayla said . Deegie 's eagerness to leave was infecting her . They were still just beginning to stir around outside the lodge , and spending some time alone just with Deegie seemed like fun . " I think Nezzie has some hot tea , and I do n't think she 'd mind if we had a cup . " " She makes mint in the morning ; I will just get something to add to it . . . something I like to drink in the morning . I think I will get my sling , too . " Nezzie insisted that the two young women eat some hot cooked grains as well , and gave them slices of meat from her roast of the night before to take along . Talut wanted to know which way they planned to go , and the general location of Deegie 's snares . When they stepped outside the main entrance , the day had begun ; the sun had risen above a bank of clouds on the horizon , and begun its journey across a clear sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame them . Deegie showed Ayla the quick twist of the foot that turned the leather loop , attached to the elongated circular frame woven across with sturdy willow withes , into a convenient snowshoe hitch . With a little practice , Ayla was soon striding across the top of the snow alongside Deegie . Jondalar watched them leaving from the entrance to the annex . With a frown , he looked at the sky and considered following them , then changed his mind . He saw a few clouds , but nothing to portend danger . Why was he always so worried about Ayla whenever she left the earthlodge ? It was ridiculous for him to follow her around . She was n't going out alone , Deegie was with her , and the two youngp343women were perfectly able to take care of themselves . . . even if it did snow . . . or worse . They 'd notice him following after a while , and then he 'd just be in the way when they wanted to be off by themselves . He let the drape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shake his feeling that Ayla might be in danger . " Oh , look , Ayla ! " Deegie cried , on her knees examining the frozen solid white-furred carcass dangling from a noose pulled tight around its neck . " I set other traps . Let 's hurry and check them . " Ayla wanted to stay and examine the snare , but she followed after Deegie . " What are you going to do with it ? " she asked when she caught up . " It depends on how many I get . I wanted to make a fringe on a fur parka for Branag , but I 'm making him a tunic , too , a red one  --  not as bright as your red . It will have long sleeves and take two hides , and I 'm trying to match the color of the second skin to the first . I think I 'd like to decorate it with the fur and teeth of a winter fox . What do you think ? " " I think it will be beautiful . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " What do you think would be best for a white tunic ? " " It depends . Do you want other colors or do you want to keep it all white ? " " I think I want it to be white , but I 'm not sure . " " White fox fur would be nice . " " I thought about that , but . . . I do n't think it would be quite right , " Ayla said . It was n't so much the color that was bothering her . She remembered that she had selected white fox furs to give to Ranec at her adoption ceremony , and did n't want any reminders about that time . The second snare had been sprung , but it was empty . The sinew noose had been bitten through , and there were wolf tracks . The third had also caught a fox , and it had apparently frozen hard in the snare , but it had been gnawed at , most of it was eaten , in fact , and the fur was useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be trapping foxes for wolves , " Deegie said . " It looks like only one , Deegie , " Ayla said . Deegie was beginning to fear she would not get another good fur , even if one had been caught in her fourth snare . They hurried to the place where she had set it . It should he over there , near those bushes , " she said as they approached a small wooded copse , " hut I do n't see . . . "  | " There it is , Deegie ! " Ayla shouted , hurrying ahead . " It looks good , too . And look at that tail ! " " Perfect ! " Deegie sighed with relief . " I wanted at least two . " She untangled the frozen fox from the noose , tied it together with the first fox , and slung them over the branch of a tree . She was feeling more relaxed now that she had trapped her two foxes . " I 'm hungry . Why do n't we stop and have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that you say it . " They were in a sparsely wooded glen , more brush than trees , formed by a creek that had cut through thick deposits of loess soil . A sense of bleak and weary exhaustion pervaded the small vale in the waning days of the long harsh winter . It was a drab place of blacks and whites and dreary grays . The snow cover , broken by the woody underbrush , was old and compacted , disturbed by many tracks , and seemed used and grimy . Broken branches exposing raw wood showed the ravages of wind , snow , and hungry animals . Willow and alder clung close to the earth , bent by the weight of climate and season to prostrate shrubs . A few scrawny birch trees stood tall and thin , scrapingbare branches noisily together in the wind , as though clamoring for the fulfilling touch of green . Even the conifers had lost their color . The twisted pines , bark scabbed with patches of gray lichen , were faded , and the tall larches were dark and sagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope was a mound of snow armed with long canes spiked with sharp thorns  --  the dry , woody stems of runnerswhich had been sent out the previous summer to claim new territory . Ayla noted it in her mind , not as an impenetrable thicket of thorny briars , but as a place to look for berries and healing leaves in their proper season . She saw beyond the bleak , tired scene to the hope it held , and after the long confinement , even a winter-weary landscape looked promising , especially with the sun shining . The two young women piled snow together to make seats on what would be the bank of a little stream if it were summer . Deegie opened her haversack and took out the food she had packed , and even more important , the water . She opened a birchbark packet and gave Ayla a compact cake of traveling food  --  the nutritious mixture of dried fruits and meat and energy-giving essential fat , shaped into a round patty . " Mother made some of her steamed loaves with pine nuts last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening another packet and breaking off a piece for Ayla . They had become a favorite of hers . " I will have to ask Tulie how to make these , " Ayla said , taking a bite before she unwrapped the slices of Nezzie 's roast , and put some down beside each of them . " I think we are having a feast out here . All we need are some fresh spring greens . "  | " That would make it perfect . I can hardly wait for spring . Once we have the Back Breaking Celebration , it seems to get harder and harder to wait , " Deegie replied . Ayla was enjoying the companionable outing with just herself and Deegie , and was even beginning to feel warm in the shallow depression , protected from winds . She untied the thong at her throat and pushed back her hood , then straightened her sling around her head . She closed her eyes and tipped her face up to the sun . She saw the circular afterimage of the dazzling orb against the red background of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After she opened her eyes again , she seemed to see with greater clarity . " Do people always wrestle at Back Breaking Celebrations ? " Ayla asked . " I have never seen anyone wrestle without moving his feet before . " " Yes , it 's to honor . . . " " Look , Deegie ! It is spring ! " Ayla interrupted , jumping up and rushing toward a willow shrub nearby . When the other woman joined her , she pointed to the hint of swelling buds along a slender twig , and one , coming into season too early to survive , that had burst forth in bright spring green . The women smiled at each other in wonder , full of the discovery , as though they had invented spring themselves . The sinew snare loop still dangled not far from the willow . Ayla held it up . " I think this is a very good way to hunt . You do not have to look for animals . You make a trap and come back later to get them , but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will catch a fix ? " " It 's not hard to make . You know how sinew gets hard if you wet it and let it dry , just like leather that is not treated ? " Ayla nodded . " You make a little loop at the end , " Deegie continued , showing her the loop . " Then you take the other end and put it through to make another loop , just big enough for a fox 's head to go through . Then you wet it , and let it dry with the loop open so it will stay open . Then you have to go where the foxes are , usually where you 've seen them or caught them before . My mother showed me this place . Usually there are foxes here every year , you can tell if there are tracks . They often follow the same paths when they are near their dens . To set the snare , you find a fox trail , and where it goes through bushes or near trees , you set the loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads , and fasten it , like this , here and here , " Deegie demonstratedas she explained . Ayla watched , her forehead furrowed in concentration . " When the fox runs along the trail , the head goes through the loop , and as he runs , it tightens the nurse around his neck . The more thep346fox struggles , the tighter the noose gets . It does n't take long . Then the only problem is finding the fox before something else does . Danug was telling me about the way people to the north have started setting snares . He says they bend down a young sapling and tie it to the noose so that it comes loose as soon as the animal is caught , and jerks it up when the tree springs back . That keeps the fox off the ground until you get back . " " I think that 's a good idea , " Ayla said , walking back toward their seats . She looked up , then suddenly , to Deegie 's surprise , she whipped her sling off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone ? " she whispered . " There ! " With a movement so swift Deegie could hardly follow , Ayla picked up the stone , set it in her sling , whipped it around and let fly . Deegie heard the stone land , but only when she got back to the seats did she see the object of Ayla 's missile . It was a white ermine , a small weasel about fourteen inches long overall , but five of the inches was a white furry tail with a black tip . In summer the elongated , soft-furred animalwould have a rich brown coat with a white underbelly , but in winter the sinuous little stoat turned pure silky white , except for its black nose , sharp little eyes , and the very tip of its tail . " It was stealing our roast meat ! " Ayla said . " I did n't even see it next to that snow . You 've got good eyes , " Deegie said . " And you 're so quick with that sling , I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A sling is good for hunting when you see what you want to hunt , but a snare can hunt for you when you are not even there . Both are useful to know , " Ayla replied , taking the question seriously . They sat down to finish their meal . Ayla 's hand kept returning to rub the soft thick fur of the little weasel as they talked . " Ermines have the nicest fur , " she said . " Most of those long weasels do , " Deegie said . " Minks , sables , even wolverines have good fur . Not so soft , but the best for hoods , if you do n't want frost clinging around your face . But it 's hard to snare them , and you ca n't really hunt them with a spear . They 're quick and vicious . Your sling seemed to work , though I still do n't know how you did it . " " I learned to use the sling hunting those kinds of animals . I only hunted meat eaters in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Deegie asked . " I was not supposed to hunt at all , so I did not hunt any animals that were food , only those that stole food from us . " She snorted a wry chuckle of realization . " I thought that would make it all right . " " Why did n't they want you to hunt ? " " Women of the Clan are forbidden to hunt . . . but they finallyp347allowed me to use my sling . " Ayla paused for an instant , remembering . " Do you know , I killed a wolverine long before I killed a rabbit ? " She smiled at the irony . Deegie shook her head in amazement . What a strange childhood Ayla must have had , she thought . They got up to leave , and as Deegie went to get her foxes , Ayla picked up the soft , white little ermine . She rubbed her hand along the body all the way to the tip of the tail . " That is what I want ! " Ayla said , suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " Deegie said . " No . I mean for the white tunic . I want to trim it with white erminefur , and the tails . I like those tails with the little black tips . " " Where are you going to get enough ermine to decorate a tunic ? " Deegie asked . " Spring is coming , they will be changing color again soon . " I do not need very many , and where there is one , there are usually more nearby . I will hunt them . Now , " Ayla said . " I need to find some good stones . " She started pushing snow out of the way , looking for stones near the bank of the frozen creek . " Now ? " Deegie said . Ayla stopped and looked up . She had almost forgotten Deegie 's presence in her excitement . She could make tracking and stalking more difficult . " You do not have to wait for me , Deegie . Go back . I will find my way . " " Go back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can be very quiet ? " Deegie smiled . " I have hunted before , Ayla . " Ayla blushed , feeling she said the wrong thing . " I did notmean . . . " I know you did n't , " Deegie said , then smiled . " I think I could learn some things from someone who killed a wolverine before she killed a rabbit . Wolverines are more vicious , mean , fearless , and spiteful than any animal alive , including hyenas . I 've seen them drive leopards away from their own kills , they 'll even stand up to a cave lion . I 'll try to stay out of your way . If you think I 'm scaring the ermine off , tell me , and I 'll wait for you here . But do n't ask me to go hack . " Ayla smiled with relief , thinking how wonderful it was to have a friend who understood her so quickly . " Ermine are as bad as wolverines . They are just smaller , Deegie . " " Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have roast meat left . It might be useful , but first we must find tricks . . . after I get a good supply of stones . " When Ayla had accumulated a pile of satisfactory missiles and putp348them in a pouch , which was attached to her belt , she picked up her haversack , and slung it over her left shoulder . Then she stopped and studied the landscape , looking for the best place to begin . Deegie stood beside her and just a step behind , waiting for her to take the lead . Almost as though she was thinking out loud , Ayla began speaking to her in a quiet voice . " Weasels do not make dens . They use whatever they find , even a rabbit 's burrow  --  after they kill the rabbits . Sometimes I think they would not need a den , if they did not have young . They are always moving : hunting , running , climbing , standing up and looking , and they are always killing , day and night , even after they have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , squirrels , rabbits , birds , eggs , insects , even dead and rotten meat , but most meat they kill and eat fresh . They make stinky musk when they are cornered , not to squirt like a skunk , but smells as bad , and they make sound like this . . . " Ayla uttered a cry that was half-strangled scream and halfgrunt . " In the season of their Pleasures , they whistle . " Deegie was utterly astonished . She had just learned more about weasels and ermine than she had learned in her entire life . She did n't even know they made a sound at all . " They are good mothers , have many babies , two hands . . . " Ayla stopped to think of the name of the counting word . " Ten , more sometimes . Other times , only few . Young stay with mother until almost grown . " She stopped again to eye the landscape critically . " This time of year , litter might still be with mother . We look for track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started toward the mound of snow that covered , more or less , the tangled mass of stems and runners that had been growing from the same place for many years . Deegie followed her , wondering how she could have learned so much , when Ayla was n't much older than she was . Deegie had noticed that Ayla 's speech had lapsed just slightly  --  it was the only sign of her excitement  --  but it made her realize how well Ayla did speak now . She seldom spoke fast , but her Mamutoi was close to perfect , except for the way she said certain sounds . Deegie thought she might never lose that speech mannerism , and rather hoped she would n't . It made her distinctive . . . and more human . " Look for small tracks with five toes , sometimes only four show , they make the smallest tracks of any meat eater , and the back paws go in the same tracks that front feet paws were in . " Deegie hung back , not wanting to trample delicate spoor , watching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her with every step she took , the snow-covered ground and each fallen log , each twig on each bush , the slender boles of bare birches and thep349weighted boughs of dark-needled pines . Suddenly her eyes stopped their constant vigilance , stilled by a sight that caught her breath . She lowered her foot slowly while reaching into the haversack for a large piece of rare roast bison , and laid it on the ground in front of her . Then she backed off carefully , and reached into the pouch of stones . Deegie looked beyond Ayla without moving , trying to see what she saw . Finally she noticed movement , and then focused on several small white shapes sinuously moving toward them . They raced with surprisingspeed though they were climbing over deadfall , up and down trees , through brush , in and around small pockets and cracks , and devouring everything they found in their path . Deegie had never taken the time to notice the small voracious carnivores before , and she watched in rapt fascination . They stood up occasionally , shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but drawn unerringly by scent to their hapless prey . Squirming through nests of voles and mice , under tree roots for hibernating newts and frogs , and darting after small birds too chilled and hungry to flee , the ravaging horde of eight or ten small white weasels closed in . Heads weaving back and forth , black little beads of eyes eager , they pounced with deadly accuracy at the brain , the nape of the neck , the jugular vein . Striking without compunction , they were the most efficient , bloodthirsty killers of the animal world , and Deegie was suddenly very glad they were small . There seemed no reason for such wanton destruction but a lust to kill  --  except the need to keep a continuously active body fueled in the way they were intendedand ordained by nature to do. iThe ermine were drawn to the slab of rare meat , and without hesitationbegan to make short work of it . Suddenly there was confusion , hard-flung stones landed among the feeding weasels , striking some down , and the unmistakable scent of weasel musk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the animals she had missedAyla 's carefully controlled preparations and swift casts . Then , out of nowhere , a large black animal bounded among the white weasels , and Ayla was stunned to hear a menacing growl . The ww off went after the slab of bison , but was held off by two bold and tearless ermine . Backing off only a bit , the black carnivore spied an ermine recently made harmless , and grabbed for it instead . But Ayla was not about to let the black wolf steal her ermine ; she had put in too much effort to get them . They were her kills and she wanted them for the white tunic . As the wolf was trotting away with the small white weasel in its mouth , Ayla went after it . Wolves were also meat caters . She had studied them just as closely as weasels when she was teaching herself to use a sling . She understood them , too . Shep350picked up a fallen branch as she ran after the animal . A single wolf usually gave way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ermine . If it had been a pack , or even just two wolves , she would not have tried such a reckless assault , but when the black wolf paused to repositionthe ermine in its mouth , Ayla went after it with the branch , hauling back to give it a solid blow . She did n't think of the branch as much of a weapon , but she planned only to scare the wolf off , and startle it into dropping the small furry animal it held . But Ayla was the one who was startled . The wolf dropped the ermine at its feet , and with a mean and ugly snarl , sprang straight for her . Her instant reaction was to throw the branch across her as a defense , to hold off the attacking wolf , and her quick surge of energy said run . But in the wooded copse , the cold and brittle branch broke as she pulled it around and hit a tree . She was left holding a rotten stump , but the broken end flew into the wolf 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf had been bluffing , too , and was n't very eager to attack . Stopping to pick up the dead ermine , the wolf climbed out of the wooded glen . Ayla was frightened , but angry , and in shock , too . She could n't just let that ermine go like that . She chased after the wolf once more . " Let it go ! " Deegie shouted . " You 've got enough ! Let the wolf have it . " But Ayla did n't hear ; she was n't paying attention . The wolf was heading for open ground and she was close behind . Reaching for anotherstone , and finding only two left , Ayla ran after the wolf . Though she expected that the large carnivore would soon outdistance her , she had to give it one more try . She loaded a stone in her sling and hurled it after the fleeing canine . The second stone that followed soon afterward finished what the first had begun . Both found their mark . She felt a sense of satisfaction when the wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing anything from her again . As she ran to get the ermine , she decided she might as well take the wolf pelt , too , but when Deegie found her , Ayla was sitting beside the dead black wolf , and the white ermine , and had n't moved . The expression on her face gave Deegie cause for concern . " What 's wrong , Ayla ? " " I should have let her have it . I should have known she had a reason for going after that roast meat , even though the ermine wanted it . Wolves know how vicious weasels are , and usually a lone wolf will back down without attacking in an unfamiliar place . I should have let her have that ermine . "  | " I do n't understand . You got your ermine back , and a black wolf pelt besides . What do you mean you should have let her have it ? " " Look , " Ayla said , pointing to the black wolf 's underbelly . " She 's nursing . She 's got pups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Deegie asked . " Yes . She 's out of season . And she 's a loner . That is why she was having so much trouble finding enough to eat . And why she came for the roast meat , and wanted the ermine so much . Look at her ribs . The pups have been taking a lot out of her . She 's hardly more than bones and fur . If she lived with a pack , they 'd be helping her feed those pups , but if she lived with a pack , she would not have had pups . Only the female leader of a pack has pups , usually , and this wolf is the wrong color . Wolves get used to certain colors and marks . She 's like that white wolf I used to watch when I was learning about them . They did n't like her either . She was always trying to make up to the female leader and the male leader , but they did n't want her around . After the pack got so big , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Ayla looked down at the black wolf . " Like this one did . Maybe that 's why she wanted to have pups , because she was lonely . But she should n't have had them so early . I think this is the same black wolf I saw when we hunted bison , Deegie . She must have left her pack to look for a lone male to start her own pack , new packs get started that way . But it 's always hard on the loners . Wolves like to hunt together , and they take care of each other . The male leader always helps the female leader with her pups . You should see them sometimes , they like to play with the babies . But where is her male ? Did she ever find one ? Did he die ? " Deegie was surprised to see that Ayla was fighting tears , over a dead wolf . " They all die some time , Ayla . We all go back to the Mother . " " I know , Deegie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She should have had something while she lived , a mate , a pack to belong to , at least some babies . " Deegie thought she was beginning to understand why Ayla was feeling so strongly about a scrawny old black wolf . She was putting herself in the wolf 's place . " She did have pups , Ayla . " " And now they are going to die , too . They do n't have a pack . Not even a male leader . Without a mother , they will die . " Suddenly Ayla jumped up . " I 'm not going to let them die ! " " What do you mean ? Where are you going ? " " I 'm going to go find them . I 'm going to track the black wolf back to her den . "  | " That could be dangerous . Maybe there are other wolves around . How can you be sure ? " " I 'm sure , Deegie . I just have to look at her . " " Well , if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , Ayla . " " What ? " " If you expect me to tramp all over the place chasing after wolf tracks with you , you can carry your own ermine , " Deegie said , dumping out five white weasel carcasses from her haversack . " I 've got enough to carry with my foxes ! " Deegie was grinning with delight . " Oh , Deegie , " Ayla said , smiling back with warmth and affection . " You brought them ! " The two young women hugged each other out of their fullness of love and friendship . " One thing is certain , Ayla . Nothing is ever dull around you ! " Deegie helped load Ayla 's haversack with the ermine . " What are you going to do about the wolf ? If we do n't take her , something else will , and a black wolf pelt is not too common . " " I 'd like to take her , but I want to find her pups , first . " " All right , I 'll carry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . " If we have time later , I 'll skin it out . " She started to ask one more question , then changed her mind . She 'd find out soon enough exactly what Ayla planned to do if she found any wolf pups left alive . They had to go back to the vale to pick up the correct set of tracks . The wolf had done a good job of covering her trail , knowing how precarious was the life she was leaving untended . Several times , Deegie was sure they 'd lost it and she was a good tracker herself , but Ayla was motivated to persist until she found it again . By the time they had found the place that Ayla was sure was the den , the sun was showing late afternoon . " I have to be honest , Ayla . I do n't see any signs of life . " " That 's the way it should be if they are alone . If there were signs of life , it would just invite trouble . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , how are you going to get them to come out ? " " I guess there is only one way . I 'll have to go in after them . " " You ca n't do that , Ayla ! It 's one thing to watch wolves from a distance , but you ca n't go into their dens . What if there are more than pups ? There could be another adult wolf around . " " Have you seen any other adult tracks besides the black 's ? " " No , but I still do n't like the idea of you going into a wolf 's den . " " I have n't come this far to go away without finding out if there areany wolf pups around . I have to go in , Deegie. "  |p353Ayla  put down her haversack and headed for the small dark hole in the ground . It was dug out of an old lair , abandoned long before because it was not the most favorable location , but it was the best the black wolf could find after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too-early heat , died in a fight . Ayla got down on her belly , and started to wriggle in . " Ayla , wait ! " Deegie called . " Here , take my knife . " Ayla nodded , put the knife in her teeth , and started into the dark hole . It sloped downward at first , and the passage was narrow . Suddenlyshe found herself stuck and had to back out . " We better go , Ayla . It 's getting late , and if you ca n't get in , you ca n't get in . " " No , " she said , pulling her parka off over her head . " I 'll get in . " She shivered with the cold until she was inside the den , but it was a tight fit through the first tunnel section , where it sloped down . Near the bottom , where it leveled out , there was more room , but the den seemed deserted . With her own body still blocking the light , it took awhile for her eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she started to back out that she thought she heard a sound . " Wolf , little wolf , are you here ? " she called , then remembering the many times she had watched and listened to wolves , she voiced a pleading whine . Then she listened . A tiny soft whimper came from the deepest , dark recess of the den , and Ayla felt like shouting for joy . She wormed her way closer to the sound , and whined again . The whimper was closer , and then she saw two shining eyes , but when she reached for the pup , he backed up and hissed a little snarl , and she felt sharp needle teeth bite her hand . " Ow ! You 've got some fight in you , " Ayla said , and then smiled ; " some life in you , yet . Come on now , little wolf . It 's going to be all right . Come on . " She reached for the wolf pup again , making her pleading whine , and felt a fuzzy ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pup , spitting and fighting all the way , toward her . Then she backed up out of the den . " Look what I found , Deegie ! " Ayla said , grinning triumphantly as she held up a little gray fuzzy wolf puppy.  |p354Jondalar  was outside the lodge , pacing back and forth between the main entrance and the horse annex . Even in the warm parka he wore , an old one of Talut 's , he was feeling the drop in temperature as the sun closed with the horizon . Several times he had climbed the slope in the direction Ayla and Deegie had taken , and was considering climbing it again . He had been trying to quell his anxiety ever since the two young women left that morning , and when he first began his worried pacing early in the afternoon , others in the earthlodge smiled condescendingly , but he was no longer alone in his concern . Tulie had hiked up the slope a few times herself , and Talut was talking about getting a group together to go look for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the brilliant fire in the west slid behind a bank of clouds hanging near the edge of the earth , it emerged as a sharply defined bright red circle of light ; an otherworldly circle without depth or dimension , too perfect , too symmetrical to belong to the natural environment . But the glowing red orb lent color to clouds and a tinge of health to the pale partial face of the other unearthly companion , which was low in the eastern sky . Just as Jondalar was about to climb up the slope again , two figures appeared at the top , silhouetted against a vivid lavender background that shaded into deep indigo . A single star glinted overhead . He breathed a great sigh and slumped against the arched tusks , feeling light-headed with the sudden release of tension . They were safe . Ayla was safe . But why were they gone so long ? They should know better than to make everyone worry so much . What could have kept them out so long ? Maybe they were in trouble . He should have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Latie was shouting . People ran out of the earthlodge half-clothed ; those that were out and dressed raced up to meet them . " What took you so long ? It 's almost dark . Where were you ? " Jondalardemanded as soon as Avla reached the lodge.  |p355She  looked at him in astonishment . " Let 's get them inside first , " Tulie said . Deegie knew her mother was not pleased , but they had been out all day , they were tired , and it was getting colder fast . Recriminations could come later , after Tulie made sure they were all right . They were hustled in , straight through the foyer and into the cooking hearth . Deegie , grateful to unload , lifted off the carcass of the black wolf , which had stiffened to the shape of her shoulder . When she dropped it on a mat , there were exclamations of surprise , and Jondalar blanched . There had been trouble . " That 's a wolf ! " Druwez said , eying his sister with awe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you see what Ayla has , " Deegie said , taking the white foxes out of her haversack . Ayla was dumping frozen ermine out of her carrier with one hand , holding the other carefully against her midriff on top of her warm , hooded fur tunic . " Those are very nice ermine , " Druwez said , not nearly as impressed with the small white weasels as he was with the black wolf , but not wanting to offend . Ayla smiled at the boy , then she untied the thong she had belted around her parka , and reaching under , withdrew a small gray ball of fur . Everyone looked to see what she had . Suddenly it moved . The wolf puppy had slept comfortably against Ayla 's warm body underneath her outer garment , but the light , and the noise , and the unfamiliar smells were frightening . The pup whimpered and tried to snuggle against the woman whose smell and warmth had become familiar . She put the small fuzzy creature down on the soil of the drawingpit . The puppy stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made a puddle that was quickly absorbed by the soft , dry dirt . " It 's a wolf ! " Danug said . " A baby wolf ! " Latie added , her eyes filled with delight . Ayla noticed Rydag hunkering close to look at the small animal . He reached out a hand , and the puppy sniffed it , and then licked it . Rydag 's smile was pure joy . " Where you get little wolf , Ayla ? " the boy signed . " Is long story , " she signaled back , " will tell later . " She quickly pulled off her parka . Nezzie took it and handed her a cup of hot tea . She smiled gratefully and took a sip . " It does n't matter where she got it . What is she going to do withit ? " Frebec demanded . Ayla knew he understood the silent language , though he claimed he did n't . He had obviously understood Rydag . She turned and faced hint.  | " I am going to take care of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with defiance . " I killed its mother "  --  she motioned toward the black wolf  --  " and I 'm going to take care of this baby . " " That 's not a baby . That 's a wolf ! An animal that can hurt people , " he said . Ayla seldom took such a strong stand with him or anyone , and he had discovered she would often give in on small issues to avoid conflict if he was nasty enough . He did n't expect the direct confrontation , and he did n't like it , especially when he could sense it was not likely to go his way . Manuv looked at the wolf puppy , and then at Frebec , and his face split into a wide grin . " Are you afraid that animal is going to hurt you , Frebec ? " The raucous laughter made Frebec flush with anger . " I did n't mean that . I mean wolves can hurt people . First it 's horses , now it 's wolves . What next ? I am not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , " he said . Then he stomped away , not ready to test whether the rest of the Lion Camp would rather have him or Ayla and her animals if he forced them to make a choice . " Do you have meat left from that bison roast , Nezzie ? " " You must be starving . I 'll fix you a plate of dinner . " " Not for me . For the wolf puppy , " Ayla said . Nezzie brought Ayla a slab of roast meat , wondering how such a small wolf was going to eat it . But Ayla remembered a lesson she had learned long ago : babies can eat whatever their mothers eat , but it must be softer and easier to chew and swallow . She had once brought an injured young cave lion cub to her valley and fed him meat and broth instead of milk . Wolves were meat eaters , too . She recalled that when she was watching wolves to learn about them , older wolves often chewed up food and swallowed it to bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppies . But she did n't have to chew it up , she had hands and a sharp knife , she could cut it up . After mincing the meat to a pulp , Ayla put it in a bowl and added warm water , to bring the temperature closer to mother 's milk . The puppy had been sniffing around the edges of the drawing pit , but seemed afraid to venture beyond its boundaries . Ayla sat down on the mat , held out her hand and softly called to the wolf . She had taken the baby from a cold and lonely place and brought it warmth and comfort , and her scent was already associated with security . The fuzzy fur ball waddled toward her outstretched hand . She picked it up first to examine it . Close scrutiny revealed the little wolf was a male , and very young , probably no more than one full cycle of moon phases had passed since he was born . She wondered if he 'd had siblings , and if he did , when they died . Ile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not seem to be malnourished , though the black wolf had certainly been scrawny . When Ayla thought about the terrible odds the black had fought to keep this one pup alive , it reminded her of an ordeal she had once faced and it strengthened her resolve . If she could , she was going to keep the mother wolf 's son alive , whatever it took , and not Frebec or anyone else was going to stop her . Holding the pup in her lap , Ayla dipped her finger in the bowl of finely minced meat and held it under the baby wolf 's nose . He was hungry . He nosed it , licked it , and then licked her finger clean . She scooped up another fingerful , and he eagerly licked that off , too . She held him on her lap , and continued to feed him , feeling his little belly round out . When she felt he had enough , she held a little water under his nose , but he only sampled . Then she got up and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find some old baskets on that bench over there , " Mamut said , following behind her . She smiled at him . He knew exactly what she had in mind . She rummaged around and found a large woven cooking container , falling apart at one end , and put it on the platform near the head of her bed . But when she put the wolf in it , he whimpered to get out . She picked him up and looked around again , not sure what would work . She was tempted to take him into her bed , but she 'd been through that with growing baby horses and lions . It was too hard getting them to change their habits later , and besides , Jondalar might not want to share his bed with a wolf . " He 's not happy in the basket . He probably wants his mother or other puppies to sleep with , " Ayla said . " Give him something of yours , Ayla , " Mamut said . " Something soft , comfortable , familiar . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her small assortment of clothes . She did n't have much . Her beautiful outfit from Deegie , the one she had made in the valley before she came , and some used odds and ends given to her by other people for changes . She 'd had plenty of spare wraps when she lived with the Clan , and even in the valley . . . She noticed the backframe she had brought from the valley put aside in a far corner of the storage platform . She looked through it and pulled out Durc 's cloak , but after holding it for a moment , she folded it and put it back . She could n't bear to give it up . Then she found her old Clan wrap , a large old hide of soft leather . She had worn one like it , wrapped around her and tied with a long thong , for as long as she could renumber , until the day she first left her valley with Jondalar . It seemed so long ago now . She lined the basket with the Clan wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffed around , then quickly snuggledin and was soon sound asleep . Suddenly she realized how tired she was , and hungry , and her clothes were still damp from the snow . She took off wet boots , and the lining made of felted mammoth wool , and changed into one of her dry outfits and the soft indoor footwear Talut had shown her how to make . She had been intrigued by the pair he had worn at her adoption ceremony , and prevailed upon him to show her how they were made . They were based on a natural characteristic of elk or deer : the hind leg bends so sharply at the gambrel joint it conforms to the natural shape of a human foot . The skin was cut above and below the joint and taken off in one piece . After curing , the lower end was then sewn with sinew to the desired size , and the upper part wrapped and laced above the ankle with cords or thongs . The result was a seamless , warm , and comfortable leather stocking-shoe . After she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses , and reassure them , but she noticed a hesitation and a resistancefrom the mare when she went to pet her . " You smell the wolf , do n't you , Whinney ? You will have to get used to it . Both of you . The wolf is going to be here with us , for a while . " She held out her hands and let both horses sniff them . Racer backed off , snorted and tossed his head , and sniffed again . Whinney put her muzzle into the woman 's hands , but her ears flattened back and she bobbed indecisively . " You got used to Baby , Whinney , you can get used to . . . Wolf . I 'll bring him out here tomorrow , when he wakes up . When you see how little he is , you will know he ca n't hurt you . When Ayla went back in , she saw Jondalar by the bed looking at the wolf puppy . His expression was unreadable , but she thought she saw curiosity and something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and his forehead furrowed in a familiar way . " Ayla , why did you stay out so long ? " he said . " Everyone was getting ready to search for you . " " We did n't plan to , but once I saw that the black wolf I killed was nursing , I had to see if I could find her pups , " Ayla said . " What difference did it make ? Wolves die all the time , Ayla ! " He had started out talking to her in a reasonable tone , but his fear for her safety was putting an edge on his voice . " It was stupid to go tracking after a wolf like that . If you had found a wolf pack , they could have killed you . " Jondalar had been beside himself with worry , but with relief came uncertainty , and a touch of frustrated anger . " It made a difference to me , Jondalar , " she flared , jumping to the defense of the wolf . " And I am not stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know wolves . If there had been a pack , I would not have backtracked to her den . The pack would have taken care of her pups . " " Even if she was a lone wolf , why did you spend all day chasing after a wolf puppy ? " Jondalar 's voice had gotten louder . He was releasinghis own tensions as well as trying to convince her not to take such chances again . " That puppy was all that mother wolf ever had . I could not let him starve because I killed his mother . If someone had n't cared about me when I was young , I would not be alive . I have to care , too , even for a wolf puppy . " Ayla 's voice had risen , too . " It 's not the same . A wolf is an animal . You should have better sense , Ayla , than to threaten your own life for the sake of a wolf puppy , " Jondalar shouted . He could n't seem to make her understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in all day . " " I have good sense , Jondalar , " Ayla said with anger flashing in her eyes . " I was the one who was out . Do n't you think I know what the weather was like ? Do n't you think I know when my life is in danger ? I took care of myself before you came , and faced far worse dangers . I even took care of you . I do n't need you to tell me I am stupid and do n't have sense . " People who were gathering at the Mammoth Hearth were reacting to the quarrel , smiling nervously and trying to make less of it . Jondalarglanced around and noticed several people smiling and talking among themselves , but the one who stood out was the dark man with the flashing eyes . Was there a hint of condescension in his broad smile ? " You 're right , Ayla . You do n't need me , do you ? For anything . " Jondalar spat , then seeing Talut approaching , he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearth , Talut ? I 'll try to stay out of everyone 's way . " No , of course I do n't mind , but ... " " Good . Thank you , " he said , and grabbed his bedding and belongingsfrom the bed platform he shared with Ayla . Ayla was stricken , beside herself to think he might really want to ' Jeep away from her . She was almost ready to beg him not to leave , hut her pride held her tongue . He had shared her bed , but they had n't shared Pleasures in so long she was sure he had stopped loving her . If he did n't love her any more , she would not try to force him to stay , though the thought of it wrenched her stomach into a knot of liar and grief . " You 'd better take your share of food , too , " she said , as he stuffed things into a hack carrier . Then , trying to find a way to make          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
