They also worry , and with good reason . Compared to the rich century of recordings that now exists , and even , in the case of older people , with their own youthful memories , classical vocalism seems in a perilous state . True , critics have complained about vocal decline in every golden age , and there are in fact plenty of superb opera singers yet among us. // But singing isn ' t so much in decline as in transition ; furthermore , singing has always been in transition , responsive to shifts of fashion and underlying currents that transcend music itself . And as we look at what is actually happening in music as a whole , we can better understand the kind of singing we encounter , singing that has been shaped by modern technology and all the ethnic and cultural subcurrents that make up American life. // Operatic singing ( which I use as a synonym for classical singing , although there are subtle differences between opera and lieder singing ) is the product of at least four centuries of evolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing are actually a frozen moment in that evolution , the state of the vocal art at the turn of this century. // With centuries-old instruments , we have pictures and often the actual violins or trumpets to instruct us as to how the music sounded back then . With the voice , before the advent of recordings , we have only second-hand description . Still , summarized quickly , it would seem that singing before the advent of opera was almost a folkish affair , closer in technique to everyday amateurism than polished professionalism . That style may even have prevailed into the early years of opera , after that form had been invented by a group of Florentine aristocrats around 1600. // Their ideal was for a rebirth of the lost art of Greek tragedy , which was sung or chanted rather than merely spoken . Early opera was a word-oriented , almost conversational art , with modest instrumental accompaniment. // But soon things changed , as mankind ' s seemingly inexorable yen for virtuosic accomplishment asserted itself . The 17th and 18th centuries were the great age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male power with the pealing brilliance of a female soprano. // In the 19th century , the castrato was finally shunned by moral fashion ( except at the Vatican , which made a place for castrated male singers into the early years of this century ) . But the need for vocal brilliance was soon satisfied by the cultivation of an altogether more muscular , stentorian style of singing , typified by the practice of singing high notes " from the chest . " Before 1830 , high notes were routinely achieved by floating out a mixture of falsetto and " head tone , " something similar to what countertenors do today . The new technique , codified in different ways by Italian verismo singers ( Enrico Caruso , Luciano Pavarotti ) and Wagnerian " heroic " sopranos ( Birgit Nilsson ) , tenors ( Lauritz Melchior ) and baritones ( Hans Hotter ) , made possible the ringing top notes we favor today . Regional variations - especially the softer , subtler French style that has now largely vanished - persisted , but the tendency was toward trumpeting operatic assertion. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . Conservatives would argue that refined aristocratic taste had been overrun by vulgar bourgeois love of spectacle . Less perjoratively , opera houses were growing and so were orchestras , and they needed big voices to match. // Ironically , however , traditional opera - both its composition and its singing - seems to have been arrested in its growth at precisely the moment that the phonograph came along to immortalize it . It was as if this ultimate act of self-consciousness - the eternal contemplation of preserved sound - both froze the creative process and fixated opera-lovers on the singing style that prevailed as the phonograph became popular. // But the same technology that provided the phonograph also provided radio , television and electronic amplification , as well as the jet plane to bring the world closer together . At the same time , new social classes muscled their way into the cultural arena ; now , it ' s the formerly vulgar bourgeoisie that thinks of itself and its operatic passions as refined , and disdains the unspeakable vulgarities of Broadway , jazz and pop as beneath it. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds impinge upon one another , just as busy New Yorkers jostle one another on the sidewalk . Singing hardly stopped evolving in the 20th century ; it just evolved so rapidly that people perceived it as a rupture . The evolution took place in areas that opera lovers failed to recognize as relevant to their sacrosanct art , and thus persist in judging , inappropriately , by the standards of the past . Conservatives have always dismissed the new by the rigidly applied criteria of the old . Now , the new and the old had diverged so widely that lovers of the old retreated into their own world , content in their isolation , but concerned about its loss of vitality. // Nevertheless , while traditionalists dreamed of the past , those seemingly disparate worlds were rushing together in the actual present . And the results of their convergence on classical singing styles can be heard everywhere - perhaps most dramatically on the stage of the New York State Theater , when the New York City Opera ' s 1987 season gets under way in a few days. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that the movie camera changed 19th-century acting . In both cases , the new technology stripped the older styles of rhetorical emphasis and stressed a conversational naturalism . Henry Pleasants , the London-based American critic , has argued that the typical microphone singer , as in the crooning of a Bing Crosby or a young Frank Sinatra , represented a rebirth of the text-centered singing favored by the Florentine inventors of opera . As it happens , people still enjoy virtuosic display and the image of effortful exertion , even when amplified - witness the popularity of rock belters like Rod Stewart and Bruce Springsteen and gospel-inflected shouters and rhetorical balladeers like Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. // But more and more , music-lovers of many sorts are showing signs of resistance to the overly fruity , throbbing , blasting sound - that ' s how they hear it - of the stereotypical opera singer . Conversely , there is clearly a fresh interest in , not to say preference for , quieter , subtler singing than a typical verismo-style opera singer can offer . While we may regret the decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best young singers are Mozartians and Straussians ( Kiri Te Kanawa , Kathleen Battle , Dawn Upshaw ) . // The new enthusiasm for early music has provided a more extreme vocal model of this sort , as with Emma Kirkby ( and she is rather violently dismissed in some traditional operatic quarters as a pale half-voice ) . The entire genre of soft rock is a latter-day extension of crooning . And the rich , microtonal subtleties of Indian music - which only found an audience beyond the intimacies of the maharajahs ' courts with the advent of amplification - has made a profound impact on Western avant-garde composers ( La Monte Young and Terry Riley have spent years studying with Pandit Pran Nath , and Philip Glass ' s fascination with Kathakali drama informs his operas , " Satyagraha " especially ) . But traditional operatic singing styles aren ' t under siege just from hushed mewlers . More extroverted singing has been irrevocably altered by non-European traditions , starting with the all-powerful influences of American blacks and their African cultural ancestry . Since the days of outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blacks have in many ways been integrated into European-derived American culture - the triumphant success of so many black opera singers is proof of that. // But in the popular realms , black singing styles , linked with both black songwriting ( spirituals , the blues ) and instrumental music ( jazz , with its instrumentally shaped singing styles , as practiced today by such flamboyant vocal virtuosos as Al Jarreau ) , have made a profound impact , first on America and long since on the world. // Traditional vernacular black vocal production and style , with its throatier , hoarser timbre , expressive pitch-shadings and openly emotional fervor , made an enormous impression on Tin Pan Alley and rock and also on Broadway musicals . They , in turn , had been previously affected by Irish balladry , Jewish melisma and a whole panoply of ethnic influences that had been precluded by the barrier of tradition and snobbery from a similarly immediate impact on operatic singing. // Much ink has been spilt on the supposedly profound differences in singing technique between a Broadway belter , pushing up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " opera singing . Clearly , however , both represent a rhetorical , extroverted technique , compared with softer , subtler approaches . And clearly , now , Broadway singing is well on its way toward a fusion with older operatic styles . The City Opera is the most visible New York forum for the broader trend whereby not just operettas but musicals are being incorporated into the operatic repertory . This has long taken place in Germany , and now it has been institutionalized here by the combined Opera/Music Theater division of the National Endowment for the Arts , the National Institute for Music Theater and by the eager exploitation of musicals by our regional opera companies - of which the City Opera might claim to be the leader. // What this means as far as singing is concerned are the now-regular appearances at the City Opera of singers like Cris Groenendaal , who made his career on Broadway and who boasts a soft , grainy , easily produced high-tenor/low baritone that wouldn ' t necessarily suit verismo-style Italian opera , but which works just fine for Leonard Bernstein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers in last season ' s City Opera production of Anthony Davis ' s " X " quite naturally inflected their operatic training with black vernacular elements , as Mr. Davis ' s score demanded . In fact , young American opera singers as a rule have a theatrical vivacity and a brashness of vocal manner less suitable for stand-and-sing grand opera but eminently desirable for more theatrically oriented modern works , especially those from the Braodway tradition. // The City Opera also more or less subtly mikes its musicals and operettas , and - though most opera fans will howl with grief , and perhaps legitimately so - will conceivably one day reinforce its opera performances in a similar manner . Such amplification is now so routine on Broadway , and is becoming so much more sophisticated and effective than it used to be , that one suspects that the time for widespread miking of all forms of music theater is only a few years away. // Some classical composers , like William Bolcom and David Del Tredici , already specify it in their scores . Amplication , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful impact on classical singing style - perhaps coarsening the purity of the sound , but perhaps also letting singers revert to expressive subtlety after too many years of pushing for volume and brilliance above all other vocal virtues. // The overwhelming presence in our culture of vocal models based on jazz and rock must inevitably affect our very conception of classical singing ; it already has , with the opera singer a cartoon symbol for fuddy-duddy social pretension . That emphatically does not imply that the best music is the most popular music . We live in a democratic culture . That means not just that the majority rules , but that we make room for minorities . It means that our best art speaks not to everyone , but to the most artistically involved among all classes and cultural subgroups . Americans will continue to perform and enjoy European-derived high art , vocal and otherwise . But such art will be inevitably - and beneficially - altered and extended by the culture in which it has taken root. // So the next time lovers of classical singing lament its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terrible singers in the past ; recordings naturally preserve the selective best . Second , that the vitality of past operatic singing owed much to its closeness to its own time and place , and was always shifting and changing. // With that firmly in mind , they can start listening for the best of today ' s singing , in light of what it has positively to offer , rather than how it negatively fails to live up to the past . Maybe Ms. Houston couldn ' t sing Tosca , but she sure can sing her own music . Maybe Mr. Groenendaal is no Caruso , but would you want to hear Caruso sing " Sweeney Todd " ( not to speak of Jose Carreras in " West Side Story. " ) ? . // There will always be a place for elite art in even the most aggressively democratic of cultures - a kind of art , and a kind of singing , that is the best medium for the best composers of the day . But in the United States in the late 20th century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in any previous human culture , that highest standard need not - can not - be verismo Italian opera of a century ago . Given Western culture ' s increasing historicism , singers will continue to be trained to perform the great art of the past , and what they must lack in instinctive sympathy they may partly make up in scholarly knowledge , as musicologists involve themselves ever more deeply with their preparation. // But our best and most representative singers , those closest to the creative vitality of the present , must sing for us , of our needs and our aspirations , not those of some long-past time and place . And they ' re already doing that , triumphantly . What ' s interesting now is how the hidebound but willing world of classical singing is finally becoming aware of its own , ongoing evolution. //
