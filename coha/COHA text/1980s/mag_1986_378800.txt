After covering the past 16 Super Bowls , Sport Writer Tom Callahan qualifies as an expert on America 's football classic . To get a unique perspective on these near mythic contests , as well as round out his cover stories on the mighty Chicago Bears as they head into Super Bowl XX against the New England Patriots , Callahan compiled vignettes on 19 former participants , one from each game . For some , Super Sunday has receded in memory as just another day on the job ; for others , it has made the rest of life anticlimactic . Taken together , says Callahan , their tales convey " a feeling for the many roads that lead away from that game . " <P> Rounding up photographs of these old Boys of Autumn proved to be a daunting task for Picture Researcher MaryAnne Golon . " Finding historical shots from the games themselves was practically impossible , since many of the men Tom talked to did not play starring roles on those days , " she says . " So we decided to take pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Easier said than done , however . Former Minnesota Viking Alan Page of Super Bowl XI , now a special assistant to the Minnesota attorney general , and former Los Angeles Ram Fred Dryer of Super Bowl XIV , now an actor on the TV series Hunter , were not interested in re-creating their gridiron days . " I appealed to Dryer 's sportsmanship and persuaded Page by telling him to pretend he was being photographed for the Pro Football Hall of Fame , " says Golon . <P> Others could not come up with the requisite team jerseys . Former New York Jet Johnny Sample of Super Bowl III was unable to find his , and even the team could not help out : today 's Jets jerseys are designed differently from those of 17 years ago . Golon finally had to commission a sporting-goods firm to make up a facsimile of a 1969 jersey . <P> Golon 's biggest challenge , and only partial disappointment , was former Miami Dolphin Mercury Morris of Super Bowl VIII , now serving a 15-to-20-year prison sentence on drug charges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Dade County correctional institution , I had to phone the head of the Florida state department of corrections , the penitentiary superintendent and Morris ' lawyer , many of them several times , " she says . " Four hours before the shoot they decided we could take the pictures , but Morris could n't wear the jersey . " Though the prison permitted Photographer Red Morgan to cart in lights , cameras and pounds of paraphernalia , Morris ' jersey was deemed to be contraband . To authorities , apparently , Morris is no longer No. 22 . He is No. 088586 . <P> Richard B. Jhonas
