When it comes to facial features , mouths and eyes are as solemn as you like , while ears can be pretty amusing , but it is noses that are unavoidably hilarious . At their very mildest , noses rarely escape a chuckle. // // Somebody with Chesterton ' s skill in the mock-serious ought to make a study of noses in art and literature . All I can do is make a few pointers . . . Indeed , Chesterton himself does make some definitive points about noses in his ' ' Song of Quoodle , ' ' a dog ' s-nose view of the world . The opening verse states : // They haven ' t got no noses , // The fallen sons of Eve ; // Even the smell of roses // Is not what they supposes ; // And more than mind discloses // And more than men believe. // This five-stanza poem , a favorite in compilations of nonsense poetry , offers a wonderful appreciation of the ' ' brilliant smell of water ' ' and the ' ' smell of dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' even ' ' the smell of Sunday morning . ' ' Quoodle ' s final comment epitomizes the essential difference between the canine and the human realms : ' ' Goodness only knowses/ The noselessness of Man. ' ' // Cyrano de Bergerac , comic-sad hero of Rostand ' s play , had a nose so noticeable that he was forced into a pose of pride in it - and scorn for others with smaller olfactory appendages . What could he do but boast ? // Others might snigger , but Cyrano took his nose seriously : ' ' My nose is huge ! Vile snub-nose , flat-nosed ass , flat-head , let me inform you that I am proud of such an appendage , since a big nose is the proper sign of a friendly , good , courteous , witty , liberal and brave man , such as I am. ' ' // But it was Edward Lear , grand master of the Victorian vogue for authentic nonsense , who was the great exponent of the nose as silliness itself . He was - unnecessarily - self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth line of his Self-Portrait in verse , ' ' How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear ! , ' ' does he remark : ' ' His nose is remarkably big. ' ' // And then throughout his prolific output of lovable nonsense , noses simply abound . ' ' O My aged Uncle Arly ! , ' ' he sings , in one of his bitter-sweetest lyrics , // O My aged Uncle Arly // Sitting on a heap of Barley // Thro ' the silent hours of night , - // Close beside a leafy thicket : - // On his nose there was a Cricket , - // In his hat a Railway-Ticket ; - // ( But his shoes were far too tight. ) // True nonsense , which this is , nevertheless implies - by inversion - SENSE , and Lear ' s poems have sensical undercurrents , make of them what you will . Surely he is himself his ' ' Uncle Arly , ' ' and it is he himself who ( as the later verses explain ) fantasizes that he had a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stooped to pick up a first-class railway ticket off the ground. // Never - never more - oh ! never // Did that Cricket leave him ever , // Dawn or evening , day or night ; // Clinging as a constant treasure , // Chirping with a cheerious measure , // Wholly to my uncle ' s pleasure , // ( But his shoes were far too tight. ) // Lear is of course the author of ' ' The Owl and the Pussy-Cat , ' ' that children ' s favorite , and even in this delicate love ditty , his imagery does not fail to include a nose : // And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood // With a ring at the end of his nose , // His nose , // His nose , // With a ring at the end of his nose. // And his limericks ! Lear was not the inventor of the limerick , but he was certainly one of its definitive exponents . Some people find his limericks disappointing . This is because their humor is genuinely nonsensical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enigmatic bathos - often it is almost a repetition of the first line but with a single , significantly insignificant change , catching you by surprise . For this reason I believe Lear ' s limericks are much subtler , and stand the test of time better , than those of some more self-consciously brilliant limerickers . His nonsense is deftly witless , not deliberately witty. // For instance : // There was an Old Man , on whose nose , // Most birds of the air could repose ; // But they all flew away , // at the closing of day , // Which relieved that Old Man // and his nose. // Or : // There was an Old Person of Tring , // Who embellished his nose with a ring ; // He gazed at the moon , // every evening in June , // That ecstatic Old Person of Tring. // That ' s ecstasy , yes. // The limericks of Lear are as full of extraordinary fantasy about noses as anything else he wrote ( and we shouldn ' t overlook the chap whose nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cassel ) and in his glorious line drawings to illustrate them he wildly makes visible the noses his wordplay proposes . ( Lear was , in fact , a serious , fastidious landscape painter . But in his nonsense drawings , as in his nonsense writing , he let his hair down with careless imaginativeness. ) // His drawing of a Young Lady with a nose that ' ' reached to her toes ' ' speaks volumes about the need we sometimes feel for the cheerful and willing assistance of others : ' ' So she hired an Old Lady , whose conduct was steady , / To carry that wonderful nose . ' ' But the drawing suggests otherwise . This nose-bearing assistant prances forward with a gleeful abandonment , born , no doubt , of the unusually exhilarating nature of her employment , and the Young Lady looks as though she is finding herself . . . led by the nose. // The nose recurs yet again in Lear ' s longer poem about ' ' The Pobble Who Has No Toes ' ' - which isn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is his Aunt Jobiska ' s theory that his toes would not have been lost as he swam the channel if he hadn ' t first managed to allow the piece of scarlet flannel she had given him to protect his NOSE to be carried away by a sea-green porpoise. // What further can be made of literary noses ? Not much . Even Shakespeare has little memorable on the subject , except perhaps ' ' A nose by any other name would smell as sweet , ' ' and inexplicably Gertrude Stein did not ( as might have been expected ) write , ' ' Nose is a nose is a nose is a nose . ' ' No , when it comes to the nose , Lear ' s the man. // //
