THE FIRST LADY OF HOME INTERIORS While Mary C , Crowley has made a lucrative career of brightening up pizzazzless houses , she 's also made it her business to do the same for people 's lives . by Holly G. Miller S upersaleswoman Mary C. Crowley may be the brains and heart behind Home Interiors and Gifts , Inc. , but to her 38,000-member all-female sales force , she 's one of the girls . Like them , she came by way of the case . The display case , that is . Twenty-five years after launching the lucrative direct-sales business from her back porch in Dallas , she sits atop a multimillion-dollar industry . Hardly a remote chief executive officer , she keeps a well-manicured hand on the pulse of the business by making frequent swings into the field . Ask her when she last attended a Home Interiors sales party and you 'll get a quick reply , usually measured in days . Last year , Mary and company opened their cases at more than 100,000 neighborhood decorating parties a week , touted their wares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a lot of wall plaques , sconces and lotus bowls . " Phenomenal , is n't it ? " asks Mary C. , as she 's known within the sisterhood . " Especially since the highest-priced piece we have is $65 . Most of our items sell for $10 , $15 or $30 . " Equally phenomenal are the rewards that are paid to the legions of ladies who demonstrate the Home Interiors line of decorating accessories over morning coffee , afternoon tea and evening punch . " If it is to be , it is up to me , " quotes Mary , who motivates her girls with catchy axioms . She proudly cites one sales rep who set a goal of $50,000 in commissions last year and made it . Territorial managers within the Home Interiors networkboast annual incomes that stretch upwards from $75,000 to $200,000 . But the Dallas-based company provides much more than just Texas-sized livelihoods . It 's a way of life , say the girls . The good life . " Mary has to be the most generous woman in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . " The first year I was in Home Interiors I won a mink and a trip to Hawaii . But the spiritual leadership she 's given me has been the most precious gift of all . She 's available to everyone who needs her . " " When Mary says I can do something , I know I can , " says Barbara Hammond , vice president of sales . " In some small way , I like to think I 'm an extension of her . " " She 's exciting , " adds Pearl Burns , a Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , resident and veteran of 23 years of Home Interiors service . " You can always expect great things to happen when you 're with Mary Crowley . She 's given us hope . " " After you 've talked with her for 20 minutes , you try to remember when you must have known her before , " says Dave Crowley , Jr. , her husband of 35 years . " She 's the warmest , most fascinating person I 've ever met . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , president and founder of the booming business . Only she 's rarely sitting . At age 67 , she 's a working chief executive whose warm personality permeates every aspect of the company . Her appearance , pleasant but not glamorous , enhances her image as one of the girls and underscores her **25;4357;TOOLONG attitude . Softly attractive , she has dark hair that is neat but not lacquer perfect , a smile that crinkles her nose and ignites her eyes and a figure she keeps in check via old-fashioned Baptist discipline and dry-toast breakfasts . " I once heard a wonderful lady say that from the neck up we tell the world what we think of the world , but from the neck down we tell the world what ' we think of ourselves , " says Mary . " At Home Interiors , we teach our girls to be physically attractive , mentally alert , financially intelligent , emotionally stable and spiritually dynamic . " She shares this philosophy when she personally trains her managers on location in Texas , pops up at regional sales meetings around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission checks and phones messages of encouragement whenever a cog in the well-tended sales machine threatens to break down . " I think all women are geniuses , " she says flatly . " And I 'm dedicated to bringing out the genius in every one of them . " Neither a feminist nor an advocate of the **36;4384;TOOLONG school of thought , she defies labels . Ruth ( Mrs. Billy ) Graham jokes that women 's lib would have to run to catch up with Mary C. Yet Mary believes a man 's home is his castle , and it 's up to his little woman to decorate it as royally as the family budget allows . Enter Home Interiors sales representative . With display case . " We 're in the business of making things attractive , " explains Mary . " I 've found that all women love pretty things . That 's why we invite customers to touch , hold and get acquainted with our accessories at Home Interiors parties . Psychologists say people actuallyoperate better in surroundings that have a certain amount of serenity . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he goes to bed and the first thing he sees in the morning can influence his life . We encourage mothers to hang a pretty little plaque , a shelf and maybe a candle in a child 's room . Saying prayers by candlelight can become a memory-making time . " She 's quick to admit that neither she nor her sales force are certified interior deco-rators . They do n't design rooms , specify carpet and cur-tains or order furniture . Their area of expertise is the ac-cessory line  --  the little splash of color or bit of whimsy that adds personality to a wall or warmth to a corner . Their display cases are jammed full with cure-alls for pizzazzless homes : planters , baskets of flowers , porcelain figurines , pictures and mirrors . What ca n't be touched or held at a Home Interiors party can be viewed . Catalogs depicting the entire line of decorative goodies are passed to each guest along with tips , courtesy of the displayer , on how to ar-range a wall grouping , which item should be purchased first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " We invest a lot in training our people , but it pays off , " says Mary . " We teach them the fundamentals of design  --  the basics of form , scale , balance and color  --  so they can speak with some kind of authority . They need the know-how ; it builds their confidence . " The message she stresses to her displayers is that no home in America needs to be dull or unattractive . Her own sprawling Dallas residence stands as an elegant example . The 50year-old English-style house smacks of good taste and comfort . Home Interiors sales reps who visit Mary by the busload every year agree that , if the Crowley estate is an indicator of their leader 's decorating talents , her success at beautifying America may surpass that of sister Texan Lady Bird Johnson . From the pleasantly cluttered bookshelves in the family room , to the huge adjoining country kitchen , to the mounds of needlepoint pillows scattered across overstuffed chairs , to the private Chapel in the Wood in the backyard , the home reflects Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treasures from the Far East are items from the " Home Interiors and Gifts Happy House Ideas " catalog  --  bisque birds , a ceramic planter , artificial flowers . " I selected everything myself , " she says . " As you can tell , I love books , music , color , warmth , good cooking and cleanliness . These are the things that form the background of a home . " As opulent as her lifestyle is , it 's never taken for granted . Mary is a comparative newcomer to life at the top and , happily , she has n't lost her appreciation for the smallest comfort . Too many struggles , endured for too many years , have left their impression . She suffers no scars from the past , but feels increased gratitude for the present . Early tragedies , such as the death of her mother , several unhappy years in the home of an uncaring stepmother , a teen-age marriage that ended in divorce and a bout with cancer just a year after launching her own business , served to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . It was this quiet sense of self-assurance that led her into the sales profession during the Great Depression . As a single parent with no particular job skills and a son and daughter to support , Mary decided to join the rest of out-of-work America in search of employment . She went to downtown Sherman , Texas , surveyed the shops , chose the most impressive of the lot and in-formed its owner she had selected his store as a place to work . The flabbergasted merchant admired her nerve enough to give her a one-day trial . Result ? She outsold every clerk on the floor , earned a permanent place on the payroll and soon was bolstering the family coffers with the store 's weekly one-dollar high-sales bonus . More importantly , she was hooked on selling as a career . " Enthusiasm and excitement can make up for other shortcomings , " she tells her sales reps today . " When enthusiasm lags , you have to work harder . Most people fail just before they succeed . Direct sales do n't depend on the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recites a favorite poem : " If you work for the things you believe in , you 're rich though the way is rough ; if you 're working only for money , you can never make quite enough . " As much as she enjoyed the sales profession , she soon found she never made quite enough ( $8 a week with bonus ) to meet the financial needs of her children , Don and Ruthie Carter . A series of night classes in accounting qualified her for a post with an insurance company and later with a furniture business . But selling was still her first love , and when girlfriend Mary Kay Eckman  --  who later founded Mary Kay Cosmetics Co. ? suggested that Mary C. join her as a demonstrator for Stanley Home Products , no arm twisting was required . She signed onto Mary Kay 's sales unit and soon surpassed her salary as an accountant . Much of what she learned as a Stanley demonstrator and later as sales manager for an imports company was put to good use when Home Interiors and Gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , 1957 . Still , success did n't come overnight . Convincing a bank to loan operating capital to a new business run by a woman was no easy task . More than one loan officer who accepted the unorthodox presence of a female CEO balked at the next revelation : The future of this new company depended on the efforts of a network of housewives who displayed decorative accessories at parties conducted in other housewives ' homes . " Yes , it was a struggle , " recalls Mary , 25 years later . " But that 's the blessed thing about memory . You tend to remember the good things . It 's kind of like the labor pains of having a baby . You just look at the baby and are so grateful . " The " baby " practically bypassed the crawling stage and immediately took off at a sprinter 's clip . Area manager Pearl Burns , who now oversees several thousand displayers , joined the company in 1959 and , after a month on the job , knew , " I had a tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , " she says . " I used to start in the morning about 7 o'clock and work through to the next day . It was a commitment . Mary always talks about the commitment to excellence and how any job worth doing is worth doing well . 1 knew that she trusted me and believed in my potential , and that 's a neat feeling . " Remembering the difficult years when she wore the dual hats of breadwinner and mother , Mary urged her salesgirls to arrange their workdays to accommodate the needs of their families . Young mothers could stay home with tod dlers during the day and schedule parties at night , while moms with school-age children might prefer morning get-togethers that concluded long before the dismissal bell . " We thought of flex time long before the government did , " she quips . The chance to operate as an independent contractor appealed to many women who did n't want the obligation of a 9-to-5 job . Branch manager Betty Goertzen remembers hearing about Home Interiors from a fellow employee at the telephone company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cerebral palsy and required a lot of daily therapy , yet we were head over heels in debt , " says Betty . " So I went to work at the phone company and literally cried all the way to the office each day because I had to leave my children . A woman in the office told me about Home Interiors and said it might be just right for me. " continued on page 87 or educational . To do that , she must look and act like a professional . We have a dress code and a behavior code . We offer training and help the girls set and meet their goals . It 's our responsibility to assist them in becoming achievers and feeling like winners . I tell them I can not accept mediocrity because it 's the greatest negative force in the world . " The work is hard , the hours are long , but the rewards are great . Mary and her son Don Carter , who serves as executive vice president of Home Interiors , delight in spreading the wealth among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation trips await the industrious salespersons who excel in Mary 's organization . " It 's the best-paying hard work in the world , but it 's hard work , " says Mary . " We do n't kid our people by telling them it 's easy , because it 's not . We believe in the dignity , excitement and glory of work . We give people an opportunity to feel good about themselves . Our goal is that everyone who comes in contact with us , whether it 's a supplier , employee , customer or displayer , will feel better about himself . " High performance standards are set not just for the sales force , but also for workers in the company-owned factories that manufacture Home Interiors products , the scores of handicapped employees who work in the home office and even for the members of the family who are carrying on the tradition in the business . All of Mary 's grandchildren have done tours of duty in the warehouse . " One reason we worked so hard this summer was we were determined that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America was built on the philosophy that everyone must be productive , and hat 's the way we can rebuild the country . " She 's doing her part in that rebuilding . In celebration of the company 's silver anniversary she 's planning a gala seminar that will draw some 19,000 displayers and managers to Dallas . Final plans are still taking shape on the drawing board , although Mary has made her recommendations : lots of beautiful flowers , a party atmosphere and plenty of gifts . Of course , sales ideas will be exchanged , business updates given and new products discussed . But learning should be fun , and growth can best be achieved in an environment of tender loving care . That 's been the Home Interiors tradition for 25 years now . Why argue with success ? " In most companies , P &; L means Profit &; Loss , ' " says a little sign in the office of one of Home Interiors ' vice presidents . " In Home Interiors , that means ' People &; Love . ' " Those words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A
