While some might object to Mr. Aragon ' s statement as hyperbolic or chauvinistic , few would deny him his point altogether . For it is true that the Mexican mural movement did not grow out of the usual European influences but sprang full blown , like Athena from the head of Zeus , from a combination of indigenous traditions and national necessity. // // As the Mexican Revolution chipped away at the repressive oligarchic regime and gradually brought about agrarian , educational , and labor reforms during the second decade of this century , a wave of populist fervor swept over Mexico and found pictorial expression in the hands of the muralists - Rivera , Jose Clemente Orozco , and David Alfaro Siqueiros . Rivera put their philosophy in the following perspective : ' ' Mexican muralism has not brought anything new to the universal plastic arts , nor to architecture , and even less to sculpture . But Mexican muralism - for the first time in the history of monumental painting - ceased to use gods , kings , chiefs of state , heroic generals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in the history of art , Mexican mural painting made the masses the hero of monumental art . That is to say , the man of the fields , of the factories , of the cities , and towns . When a hero appears among the people , it is clearly as part of the people and as one of them. ' ' // Of the triumvirate , Rivera ( 1886-1957 ) had the greatest influence on North American artists , such as Thomas Hart Benton , Ben Shahn , and Works Progress Administration muralists during the 1930s , because of the several mural and fresco cycles he executed in the United States . The most celebrated of these are in San Francisco at the Pacific Stock Exchange , the City College , the Art Institute , and in Detroit at the Institute of Arts , which boasts a 27-panel tribute to the city ' s industry. // The idea for a Rivera exhibition originated in Detroit , when the cartoons for the cycle were discovered in the basement and gradually evolved into a full-fledged retrospective commemorating the 100th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit , highlighted by a display of 13 cartoons and the fresco cycle itself . The traveling exhibition that is currently at the Philadelphia Museum is necessarily a somewhat less dramatic version , without the frescos and all the cartoons . It comprises , nevertheless , an impressive 100 paintings , 140 words on paper , three cartoons , two portable panels from the museum ' s collection , and about 100 photographs. // It is ironic that , despite the fact that Rivera flung himself with such passion into the Mexican mural movement , his painterly roots were in the European tradition . Rivera studied in Spain , France , and Italy for almost 15 years before returning to Mexico in 1921 . During those years he assimilated the influences of such divergent painters as El Greco and Picasso , Cezanne and Gauguin , Ingres , and Modigliani . In fact , a discussion of influences upon Rivera is almost pointless , as the first part of this exhibition illustrates , because Rivera segued with such facility and rapidity from school to school , style to style , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon them all , except for the occasional evocation or experiment . These early paintings also demonstrate , however , that this was truly a protean genius . They compel those who might be tempted to toss him off as a mere muralist or proletarian painter to acknowledge his status , not as an imitator , but as an original interpreter of European movements on a par with their masters. // Like a gourmet chef , Rivera tasted and digested European cuisine and then went on to make up his own native recipes . He took his inspiration directly from Mexico , from ' ' that inexpressible beauty of that rich and severe , wretched and exuberant land , ' ' as he put it , not only in terms of his subject matter but his style . He abstractly interprets the square , massive bulk of the peasants and work he so lovingly portrays , as if they were solid geometry or icons derived from the pre-Columbian age . Similarly , his palette is a kaleidoscope of the earth tones and brilliant hues of the Mexican landscape . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious in his paintings of achieving structural balance. // Rivera had a tendency to idolize peasants and workers , even the tools and machinery they used in their labor , and at times throughout his life belonged to the Communist Party . His political leanings were the most controversial aspect of his life and resulted in the loss of at least one commission - a mural at Rockefeller Center in which he had painted a figure that resembled Lenin . It is important to bear in mind , however , that he resigned from the Communist Party as often as he joined it , and just as the US deplored his left-wing tendencies , the Communist Party press denounced him as ' ' an agent of American imperialism . ' ' A sensitive study of his murals and of his perceptive , compassionate portraits of individuals suggests that the only fair label to affix to Rivera is humanist . His admiration and respect for human beings from all walks of life , from the factory worker to Edsel Ford , was profound , and he felt it his mission to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition itself is a mural of sorts , presenting the panorama of Rivera ' s oeuvre . The highlight is the three monumental cartoons for the Detroit fresco cycle , and there is another very interesting section consisting of drawings , plans , and photographs on the ' ' Liberated Earth with Natural Forces Controlled by Man ' ' frescos at the university chapel at Chapingo , near Mexico City . Unfortunately , there is no opportunity to view the actual frescos and murals . There is , however , a 35-minute film , ' ' The Frescos of Diego Rivera , ' ' that helps fill the gap , and the catalog also reproduces and deals comprehensively with the frescos. // Organized by Linda Downs , curator of education , and Ellen Sharp , curator of graphic arts at the Detroit Institute of Arts , the exhibition was funded by the Ford Motor Company Fund with the assistance of the National Endowment for the Arts . After it closes here Aug. 10 , the exhibition will travel to museums in Mexico City , Madrid , and West Berlin. // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
