' ' The comradeship that is evolving among chefs and restaurateurs toward the issue of people less fortunate than ourselves is really great , ' ' he says . ' ' This is not a quick fix , like Band Aid or Live Aid , ' ' Mr. Cunningham adds . ' ' This is a long-term commitment that each year is becoming bigger and bigger. ' ' // // In addition to raising money , SOS raises awareness of the problem of hunger and what can be done - like taking food to shelters instead of throwing it out. // ' ' In the past , when a company had a big dinner , I don ' t really know what happened to the extra 50 dinners , ' ' says Cunningham . ' ' But now there ' s a program . People are much more aware of the options . When they have food left over , they bring it down to the shelters themselves. ' ' // SOS was founded in 1984 by Bill Shore , a former Senate legislative aide , in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonprofit group is run by a staff of five. // Today the network reaches into more than 60 cities across the United States , tapping resources from restaurants and helping distribute them to more than 120 hunger programs - community food banks , shelters , and soup kitchens . Some money is also given to overseas relief groups , like Oxfam America , based in Boston , and Grassroots International in the Philippines . The most recent SOS program , ' ' Fight Food Waste , ' ' provides funds for groups that salvage leftovers from restaurants , caterers , and institutions. // What ' s unique about SOS is the way they raise money by ' ' creative donating. ' ' // ' ' What we ' ve discovered , ' ' says Mr. Shore , ' ' is people would rather do anything than write a check , even if it ' s more expensive. ' ' // Such contributions include : // *Fine dishes from the best restaurants , which are served at an annual fund-raising banquet. // *Pictures from food photographers , which are made into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s best writers ( Anne Tyler , Louise Erdrich , Mona Simpson , Tobias Wolff , Ethan Canin , for example ) , which has been collected into an anthology , ' ' Louder Than Words , ' ' on sale this month . ( So far the book has already earned several thousand dollars for SOS from the sale of first serial rights to magazines. ) // The way Shore has organized the restaurant industry is not typical of most groups . ' ' They ( SOS ) know how to mobilize communities quickly and to carry off big events , ' ' says Westy Egmont , executive director of the Boston Food Bank . ' ' In that sense they come with a very different contribution to the cause. ' ' // Shore credits his organizing success to the ' ' theory of concentric circles , ' ' which he learned working on Gary Hart ' s presidential campaign in 1984. // ' ' When you organize , ' ' Shore says , ' ' there are some people at the core who are opinion leaders . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next level or circle , . . . and so on and so on. ' ' // Why rely on restaurants rather than big corporate donors ? Not only because it ' s a logical connection , says Shore , but also because of their local base . ' ' Restaurateurs are , at least at a certain level , pretty active - community involved , civic minded , ' ' says Shore . ' ' They ' re more involved in their communities on a grass-roots level , almost at a neighborhood level . ' ' And they make their living selling food . ' ' One of the premises of our organization is people want to - if they can understand a way in which they can be helpful - they want to do the right thing . . . Most restaurateurs really feel very uncomfortable about how much food they throw away. ' ' // In its new program , SOS gives funds to groups that redistribute perishable foods to the needy . This is just beginning to catch on : Food banks and transfer programs salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution centers ( soup kitchens and homeless shelters ) . So far SOS provides money for transportation and refrigeration , and is active in 32 cities where transfer programs are already operating. // Although SOS currently works with upscale , ' ' white linen ' ' restaurants , Shore expects to extend the network over the next 10 years into smaller communities across the country . ' ' It ' s going to take time , ' ' he says. // Not everyone agrees with the approach . In Providence , R.I. , for example , restaurant owner Guy Abelson says waste in restaurants is sporadic and usually too little to bother saving. // Further , those with the most to offer - institutions like schools and hospitals - are worried about liability . Though there are Good Samaritan laws that protect food donors from liability in every state , ' ' they ' re not really enforced in Rhode Island , ' ' says Mr. Abelson. // The picture is different in the Boston area , where two perishable-food programs are operating around the city . ' ' Second Helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes daily trips to collect food from corporate kitchens and deliver it to shelters like Project Place in the South End section of the city. // A smaller group , Food For Free in Cambridge , Mass. , received $2 , 200 from SOS after the ' ' Taste of the Nation ' ' event last spring . This money was used to buy food at the Food Bank and help operate the van that picks up perishable produce from city food co-ops and grocery stores . These supplies are delivered to neighborhood food pantries , where needy families can ' ' shop ' ' for free . Some foods are delivered directly to homes and shelters. // ' ' Our priority is to be able to serve people so they can stay in their homes and not have to go to shelters , ' ' says coordinator Suzanne Motheral . Most clients are families . ' ' By enabling people to come to the pantry and then go home and eat ( helps ) maintain their integrity as a family. ' ' // Hunger relief on such a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping people instead of letting them get drawn into welfare or falling over the edge . It keeps people on the edge . . . , which isn ' t great , but it ' s a lot harder to climb out ( if ) you ' re homeless. ' ' // Tufts professor J. Larry Brown , who chaired the Physician Task Force on Hunger In America , cautions that emergency relief efforts shouldn ' t be viewed as the ultimate solution . ' ' They ' re very necessary and very helpful . But they have a job that shouldn ' t exist. ' ' // What ' s needed , says Dr. Brown , is political action . ' ' These feeding facilities , if they want to be responsible , have to put pressure on Congress to provide a lasting solution to hunger rather than rely on the interim solution of handouts.
