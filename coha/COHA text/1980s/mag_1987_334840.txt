Never have the stakes in a corporate battle been higher . After losing a crucial decision in the U.S. Supreme Court last week , Texaco faced the disastrous prospect of having to post a $10 billion bond in its epic legal fight with Pennzoil . As its stock plummeted and its credit began to dry up , the company was thrown into a financial crisis . Over the weekend , Texaco 's board of directors gathered for an emergency meeting at the firm 's White Plains , N.Y. , headquarters . Following a marathon discussion , the directors chose a stunning course : the eighth largest U.S. industrial corporation ( 1986 sales : $32.6 billion ) and the third-ranking oil firm filed for Chapter 11 protection on Sunday . Texaco suddenly became the biggest company in American history to go into bankruptcy . <P> Texaco made that dismal choice only after frantic , repeated efforts to reach a settlement with Pennzoil produced no results . Within hours following the Supreme Court 's ruling , Texaco Chairman Alfred DeCrane , 55 , and Chief Executive James Kinnear , 59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pennzoil 's home city of Houston . But Pennzoil 's combative chairman , J. Hugh Liedtke , 65 , who has stayed on past retirement age to fight the case , steadfastly refused at least ten settlement offers from Texaco . At the start of the talks , Texaco apparently had a figure of $500 million in mind , but Pennzoil was believed to have held out for at least $3 billion . <P> The dispute had taken on historic proportions in November 1985 , when a Texas jury issued a $10.5 billion judgment against Texaco for inducing Getty Oil to break a merger agreement with Pennzoil . After more than 17 months of intricate legal maneuvers , the battle came down to a test of strength and nerve between resolute executives at two powerful corporations . In the end , neither side was willing to move far enough from its initial negotiating stance to reach an agreement . <P> Texaco left itself an escape hatch . Officials said that if a settlement was reached soon or a large reduction of the bond granted , then the company could withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texaco could be using its bankruptcy as the ultimate pressure tactic against Pennzoil . Liedtke flew to New York City on Sunday . <P> Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law , Texaco will be allowed to continue normal business operations . Its cash flow could actually improve because it will still receive sales revenue and yet be afforded relief from interest payments on its $9.1 billion in debts . But it could also lose a great deal of business because of uncertainty surrounding the Pennzoil case . Many of the jobs held by the company 's 52,000 employees could be threatened . Moreover , Texaco will be under the strict supervision of a federal court . It will , for example , be forbidden to buy major oil reserves or other substantial assets without the approval of Texaco 's creditors , or failing that , of the judge . Such restraints could hamstring the planning and undermine the future of a once mighty corporation .
