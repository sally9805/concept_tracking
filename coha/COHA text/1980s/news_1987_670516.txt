Whether they saw it or not - and , in the sometimes murky nighttime skies of New York , they may not have - the moon was officially sighted yesterday by reputable witnesses in Mecca , Saudi Arabia. // And so today many of New York City ' s more than 50 , 000 Moslems began the monthlong fast of Ramadan . Until the next new moon is sighted , which could be in 30 days , they will abstain from eating and drinking from the first light of each day until sundown. // Those who choose not to abide only by the sightings in Mecca , but also rely on astronomical calculations that say that the first cresent of the moon will be visible tonight , will start the fast tomorrow . <> <> Holiest Period of Calendar // Ramadan , the holiest period of the Moslem calendar , marks the month in which the Koran was revealed to the prophet Mohammed . It is a time of repentance and impassioned prayer , of good deeds and charity , and it is a time when Moslems act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be different than other months , " said Ghiath Moustapha , a 39-year-old Syrian immigrant who runs the Oriental Pastry and Grocery at 170 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn . " If someone takes advantage of you , that ' s O.K. But you shouldn ' t take advantage of other people. " // Naji Almontaser , manager of the Morocco Star restaurant at 205 Atlantic Avenue , said : " This is the month when you see people who don ' t come to the mosque , come to the mosque . People who never donate , now donate . People who never smile can ' t get a smile off their faces. " // The holiday imposes many changes along downtown Brooklyn ' s western-most stretch of Atlantic Avenue , where Arabic merchants predominate and bazaars are lined with burlap bags of couscous , bulgur wheat , lentils , chick peas , dark-roast coffee and melon seeds. // Mr. Moustapha , who sells dates as fat as plums and a dozen varieties of olives , said he sold more dates during Ramadan because Moslems often ended the day ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have done . However , Henry Halaby , an owner of Damascus Bakery at 195 Atlantic Avenue , said he sold about 30 percent less walnut and pistachio baklava because people had difficulty eating such heavy desserts after their daylong fasts. // Mr. Halaby , an American-born Catholic whose grandfather was a Syrian Moslem , said his bakery ' s productivity suffers during Ramadan . " My workers are sweating and they can ' t drink , " he said . " It slows them down . " <> <> Business Continues // On Atlantic Avenue , lunchtime business at many restaurants is slower , though it does not drop dramatically since many year-round customers are Christians and Jews who work in nearby law offices and government buildings . Surprisingly , Mr. Almontaser said his business actually increases - a phenomenon he believes is a divine " trial " of his devotion to the fast. // Mr. Moustapha looks forward to Ramadan all year . He said he then appreciates the suffering that the poor and hungry experience most of the year . He also discovered a special side-effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year , " he said . " It cures most of your stomach diseases , and you feel real good . " <> <> A Regimen Developed // Like most observant Moslems , Mr. Moustapha , who is called Gary by his American friends , has a regimen for breaking the fast . After the sun sets , he starts with something light - a soup of chicken , rice or vegetables . The main course is usually vegetables rather than meat. // " You shouldn ' t eat fast , " he cautioned. // When he finishes his meal , he says his last of five daily prayers and then sleeps . He does not , as some Moslems do , rouse themselves about 3 or 4 A.M. , before daybreak , to have a snack to stand them for at least 16 hours of fasting. // " When you eat after a day of hunger , you feel how important food is , " Mr. Moustapha said . " You feel the enjoyment of food , how food is good. " #5 Pillars of Islam The fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar , is among the five pillars of Islam . The others are belief in the oneness of God and the prophethood of Mohammed , prayer five times daily , the giving of charity , and the hajj - the pilgrimage to Mecca that an observant Moslem must make at least once. // Fasting is believed to purify the heart - particularly when accompanied by prayer . During Ramadan , a prayer for forgiveness is added to the nighttime prayer and additional portions of the Koran are read. // Fred Habib , owner of the Bourock Restaurant at 172 Atlantic Avenue , prays in a small room in his restaurant . Other merchants walk to the Islamic Mission of America at 143 State Street , one of two nearby mosques. // There , in the basement of a whitewashed , three-story brownstone on a leafy Brooklyn Heights block , the Moslems pray , shoeless and crouched on their knees . They often bow their heads to the floor and face the far corner of the room in the direction , a compass has told them , where Mecca lies . <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bey , the mosque ' s imam , or spiritual leader - an Indonesian Moslem whose lean , pale face ends in a thin goatee - said most Moslems do not find the obligations of Ramadan an ordeal . " There ' s a special belief that we get some special strength during Ramadan , " he said . " It is a month full of blessings. " // In recent years , more American Moslems have been observing Ramadan and other rituals , said Dawud Assad , the director of a national association of mosques . Moslems from disparate countries , he said , are finding that in America they can establish ties around their religion rather than their nationality. // Perhaps the rituals that are most fretted over are the astronomical ones . Moslems believe they must start each day ' s fast at the first light of day , which is determined when a black thread can be distinguished from a white one. // While some old-timers try to sight the new moon themselves and others simply locate the time in newspapers ' astronomical tables , many Moslems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Mecca . <> <> Awaiting Call From Mecca // Indeed , yesterday Mr. Assad was standing by his midtown office telephone waiting for a call from Mecca that would tell him whether two witnesses had signed affidavits in front of Saudi Arabia ' s Minister of Islamic Affairs certifying the sighting of the moon . Although Mr. Assad told his member mosques of the early Mecca sighting , many New York Moslems planned to start the fast tomorrow , relying on calculations from astronomical tables. // When the next new moon is sighted , Ramadan ends , and the next day will be id al-fitr , the festival of the breaking of the fast . Observant Moslems usually take the day off , dress up , visit relatives and friends and eat with great zest. // Mr. Moustapha ' s customers will buy generous quantities of sweets such as baklava and dried fruits . By eating such desserts , they express their pleasure and gratitude to God for having survived another Ramadan. //                  @ @ @
