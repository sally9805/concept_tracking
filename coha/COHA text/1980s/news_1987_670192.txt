WASHINGTON  --  The General Accounting Office charged that Lockheed Missiles &; Space Co. personnel attempted to alter recent flight-test scores of the Aquila reconnaissance drone . The GAO , an investigative arm of Congress , said the activity involving recent Aquila test flights in Fort Hood , Texas , " raises questions of compliance " with federal statutes prohibiting defense contractors from manipulating the results of such tests . The Lockheed Corp. subsidiary is the sole contractor for the pilotless vehicle , which has been drawing fire from Congress because of its shaky performance and escalating costs . Sen. William Roth ( R. , Del. ) , who commissioned the report , sent it to the office of the Pentagon ' s inspector general with a demand for an investigation . " I find the possibility of a military contractor influencing the Army ' s estimation of a weapon to be shocking and highly unethical , " Sen. Roth said . Spokesmen for Lockheed Missiles &; Space in Austin , Texas , said the company hadn ' t seen the GAO report , but added that Lockheed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve done nothing wrong . " Lockheed Corp. is based in Calabasas , Calif . The GAO said it observed the alleged manipulation while surveying Army testing of the Aquila between November 1986 and March 1987 . The report raised the broader issue of how a 1986 federal statute limiting the participation of contractor personnel in weapons testing should be interpreted . In January , Sen. Sam Nunn ( D. , Ga. ) , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and his House counterpart , Rep. Les Aspin ( D. , Wis. ) , told Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger that Congress intended the law to be strictly interpreted . But the Pentagon , which at times needs help from contractor personnel in conducting tests of complex weapons systems , is known to be resisting a very rigid interpretation of the statute . The Army insisted that employees of Lockheed Missiles didn ' t go beyond their " usual role of technically advising and assisting the Army " on the Aquila tests and didn ' t " unduly influence the Army ' s scoring . " But the GAO claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockheed personnel often argued for scores that would indicate higher reliability . In some cases , the contractor ' s employees " provided misleading information to support their arguments , " the GAO said . Separately , Lockheed Missiles &; Space said the Army selected it for a five-year Strategic Defense Initiative laser experiment with a potential value of $500 million to $600 million . The company said the program , to be conducted at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , involves developing technology for a laser system that could destroy incoming enemy missiles and warheads . Lockheed said it will design , develop , build , integrate and operate a beam-control system for the program , called the Ground-Based Free Electron Laser Technology Integration Experiment . Lockheed Missiles &; Space , which now will negotiate a formal contract with the Army , won the work in competition with the Electro-Optical &; Data Systems Group of Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft Co. , a unit of General Motors Corp . A spokesman for the Lockheed unit said part of the experiment would involve placing " some type of target in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to penetrate the atmosphere to hit the target . The award catapults Lockheed Missiles &; Space toward the top ranks of contractors with work under President Reagan ' s so-called Star Wars program . The Lockheed spokesman said the latest award brings the value of the company ' s SDI contracts to more than $1. 6 billion.  --  - Roy J.
