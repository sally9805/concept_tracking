Ah , Hollywood ! Barbara Boyle , former senior vice president at Orion Pictures , dubs the place " Boys Town . " Director Martha Coolidge calls it " the land of the starlet . " Hollywood , though , has always been an industry in which powerful men made films starring beautiful women . The guys ran things  --  as producers , directors , bosses  --  and the highest-paid females were so much screen sirloin . The very job descriptions were sexist : cameraman but script girl . And ruling the set , in his safari jacket and jodhpurs , was the director  --  an amalgam of Da Vinci and De Sade , Patton and Hemingway . A man 's man . No girls needed apply . <P> They are now , though . Women have started demolishing Hollywood 's most honored typecasting : the macho movie director . They have done it the old-fashioned way , by making movies that make money . Amy Heckerling 's National Lampoon 's European Vacation earned some $50 million at the box office and finished among 1985 's top-ten-grossing pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million on a $5 million budget and graced many a ten-best list . Now that , as Seidelman notes , " women directors are no longer looked at as novelty items , " their more established sisters can get back into the act . Barbra Streisand , 43 , the all-around auteur of 1983 's Yentl , will soon direct an adaptation of the AIDS play The Normal Heart . And Elaine May , 53 , an early- ' 70s trailblazer with her comedies A New Leaf and The Heartbreak Kid , is currently directing Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman in Ishtar  --  at $30 million , the most expensive film ever entrusted to a woman . <P> Women are scoring in the low-budget action and independent markets as well , directing movies that can serve as calling cards to the major studios . Penelope Spheeris , 40 , has two grungy , turbulent melodramas in release this month , Hollywood Vice Squad and The Boys Next Door . At the other end of the fringe , Donna Deitch , 40 , won the Jury Prize at this year 's U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in Reno that plays like The Women hyped on estrogen . The festival 's Grand Prize went to Joyce Chopra 's Smooth Talk , which opened in New York City recently to critical raves . <P> Smooth Talk , based on a Joyce Carol Gates short story , illuminates the traditional contours of a woman director 's film  --  the leisurely portraiture of an ordinary family  --  then shockingly reveals a mysterious fable of fear and longing . Connie ( Laura Dern ) is a coltish California girl trying to cope with her brand-new woman 's body and its desperate urgencies . She sasses her angry mom , cruises the mall with her girlfriends and dreams of a boy who will hold her close and sing to her . Enter Arnold Friend ( Treat Williams ) , an older man whose silky threats mesmerize the girl into taking his dare . Arnold is Connie 's demon lover , a nightmare image of every male she has ever vamped , and the price he exacts is her realization that 15 is too young to grow up and old .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
