NEW YORK  --  Chemical New York Corp. posted a 7. 5% drop in fourth-quarter earnings , largely because of a bigger provision for loan losses and higher operating expenses . Chemical , parent of Chemical Bank , the nation ' s sixth-largest bank , said net income was $97. 6 million , or $1. 82 a share , compared with $105. 5 million , or $2. 03 a share , a year earlier . An 80% rise in foreign-exchange trading profit , to $33. 5 million , and a resumption of interest payments by Argentina prevented a steeper slide in earnings . Analysts noted that Chemical raised its loss reserve in a period of strong trading profit and thus was able to offset part of the negative impact on earnings that comes from an increase in those reserves . Other banks are expected to follow a similar strategy , analysts said . " Some of the volatile areas ( such as foreign exchange and bond trading ) will present opportunities to strengthen loan-loss provisions , especially for the New York banks , " said James McDermott Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chemical said its fourth-quarter provision for loan losses was $75. 6 million , 45% more than the year-earlier provision of $52. 1 million . Its total allowance for loan losses was $567. 9 million at year ' s end , up from $540. 7 million Sept. 30 and $454. 2 million at the end of 1984 . Net loan write-offs in the latest quarter were $50. 8 million , up from $38. 3 million a year earlier . Staff expenses fell 2. 8% to $181 million in the fourth quarter because a new accounting standard allowed Chemical to reduce its pension-fund contributions by $12. 3 million . But other expenses , including rent and equipment , rose 20% to $217. 6 million in the quarter . Chemical said the increase reflected " business expansion and the continuing process of upgrading delivery systems . " For the year , Chemical ' s net rose 14. 5% , to $390. 2 million , or $7. 33 a share , from $340. 5 million , or $6. 48 a share , in 1984 . Chemical said that $159 million of its Argentine public-sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renegotiated loans fell to $1. 19 billion at year ' s end from $1. 43 billion Sept. 30 and $1. 2 billion at the end of 1984 . Chemical said $67 million of private-sector Argentine loans are still nonaccruing , meaning that interest hasn ' t been paid on them for at least 90 days . Its total Argentine loans were about $390 million at year ' s end . Chemical was the first major bank holding company to report fourth-quarter results . Mr. McDermott said fourth-quarter earnings of several other New York banking companies , including Manufacturers Hanover Corp . , J.P. Morgan &; Co. and Chase Manhattan Corp. , also are expected to benefit from Argentina ' s resumption of payments . At year ' s end , Chemical ' s provision for loan losses was equal to 1. 45% of loans outstanding , compared with 1. 4% Sept. 30 and 1. 22% at the end of 1984 . Chemical ' s gains from sales of investment securities , such as government bonds , remained strong at $32. 5 million , up from $29. 2 million in the year-earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close at $45. 125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . Other bank stocks also fell as interest rates rose . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
