 | When Israeli armored columns invaded Lebanon 's Bekaa valley in 1982 , a reserve tank battalion advanced rapidly toward a hamlet called Sultan Yakoub . The commander 's plan was to capture the village and establish a defensive position there against an anticipated Syrian counterattack . But the battalion met with a surprise . " The hamlet turned out to be the staging area for a Syrian mechanized brigade , " says Samuel M. Katz , author of several books on Israel 's defense forces . " Advancing into the village , the small Israeli force found itself surrounded . In the fierce fight that erupted , the Israelis were eventually able to break through and escape , but a few of their disabled M-60 Patton tanks were captured by Syrian troops . " Lost along with the tanks was a valuable new type of armor enhancement called " Blazer " Manufactured and first tested in combat by the Israelis , Blazer is a reactive armor that bolts on top of a tank 's existing steel hull and turret . It explodes outward to blunt the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warheads ) widely used against tanks . In service , Blazer armor has enabled Israeli tanks to take multiple direct hits and keep on fighting , where unprotected tanks would have been seriously damaged or destroyed . Shaped-charge weapons exploit a phenomenon called the Monroe effect , using a high-explosive charge to generate an armor-piercing jet of metal ( see illustrations ) . When the warhead is detonated at the correct distance from the target , it can penetrate armor plate five times as thick as its own diameter . Soviet tanks get reactive armor A development that has caused consternation among U.S. and European defense planners is the sighting of large numbers of recent-model reactive-armor-equipped Soviet tanks on maneuvers in central Europe . The technology captured from Israel is believed to have quickly made its way from the Syrians into the arms plants of the U.S.S.R. Because NATO strategy relies heavily on large numbers of shaped-charge missiles to counter the Soviet Union 's  | formidable tank forces , weapon designers are scrambling to keep up with the Joneses , as it were . A product of this effort is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . " It defeats reactive armor and kills the enemy tank , " Maj. Gen. Wilson A. Shoffner of the U.S. Army told a Congressional Military Reform Caucus forum last summer . The Army is also equipping its Bradley fighting vehicles and older M-60 series tanks with reactive armor . But Pentagon consultant Phillip A. Karber , vice president for national security programs at BDM Corp. , a Washington , D.C. , think tank , is n't sure the tandem warhead will be a sure-fire solution . The Soviets , he says . are already known to be mounting multiple layers of reactive armor on their T-64B tanks to counter the new missile 's double whammy . The armor race NATO 's 60-ton main battle tanks ? the American M-1 , the British Challenger , and the West German Leopard II ? are felt to be tough enough to withstand shaped-charge warheads without any reactive armor . The latest-generation Soviet T-64B . T-72M , and T-80 tanks weigh a svelte ( as tanks go ) 45 tons . They use multilayered composite armor that 's about 75 to 80 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping smaller shaped-charge warheads . But there is n't room on a Soviet tank to add enough composite armor to counter NATO 's heaviest HEAT weapons Faced with this situation , Soviet designers must have seen reactive armor as a bargain , Karber observes . It can help protect their current tanks against an array of anti-tank weapons and avoid the expense of designing and building completely new tanks . Needless to say , reactive armor 's demonstrated ability to steal the thunder from shaped-charge warheads has quickened the pace of research into new ways to knock out tanks . Karber says one idea being explored is " active armor that senses an incoming warhead and spits out pellets that damage the warhead before it strikes Another possibility is an electromagnetic rail gun Aug. ' 87 that would overcome armor with ultra-high-velocity penetrators . The arrival of reactive armor does n't mean there 's currently no way to stop an oncoming tank , however . Largecaliber guns firing finned tungsten " darts " are still able to penetrate robust combinations of armor .
