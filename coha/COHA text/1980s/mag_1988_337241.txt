Charles Waterton was just another typical eccentric . In his 80s the eminent country squire was to be seen clambering around the upper branches of an oak tree with what was aptly described as the agility of an " adolescent gorilla . " The beloved 27th lord of Walton Hall also devoted his distinguished old age to scratching the back part of his head with his right big toe . Such displays of animal high spirits were not , however , confined to the gentleman 's later years . When young , Waterton made four separate trips to South America , where he sought the wourali poison ( a cure , he was convinced , for hydrophobia ) , and once spent months on end with one foot dangling from his hammock in the quixotic hope of having his toe sucked by a vampire bat . <P> James Warren Jones , by contrast , was something of a weirdo . As a boy in the casket-making town of Lynn , Ind. , he used to conduct elaborate funeral services for dead pets . Later , as a struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow tie and tweed jacket , selling imported monkeys . After briefly fleeing to South America ( a shelter , he believed , from an imminent nuclear holocaust ) , the man who regarded himself as a reincarnation of Lenin settled in Northern California and opened some convalescent homes . Then , one humid day in the jungles of Guyana , he ordered his followers to drink a Kool-Aid-like punch soured with cyanide . By the time the world arrived at Jonestown , 911 people were dead . <P> The difference between the eccentric and the weirdo is , in its way , the difference between a man with a teddy bear in his hand and a man with a gun . We are also , of course , besieged by other kinds of deviants  --  crackpots , oddballs , fanatics , quacks and cranks . But the weirdo and the eccentric define between them that invisible line at which strangeness acquires an edge and oddness becomes menace . <P> The difference between the two starts with the words themselves : eccentric , after all , carries a distinguished Latin pedigree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the center ; weird , by comparison , has its mongrel origins in the Old English wyrd , meaning fate or destiny ; and the larger , darker forces conjured up by the term  --  Macbeth 's weird sisters and the like  --  are given an extra twist with the slangy , bastard suffix -o . Beneath the linguistic roots , however , we feel the difference on our pulses . The eccentric we generally regard as something of a donny , dotty , harmless type , like the British peer who threw over his Cambridge fellowship in order to live in a bath . The weirdo is an altogether more shadowy figure  --  Charles Manson acting out his messianic visions . The eccentric is a distinctive presence ; the weirdo something of an absence , who casts no reflection in society 's mirror . The eccentric raises a smile ; the weirdo leaves a chill .
