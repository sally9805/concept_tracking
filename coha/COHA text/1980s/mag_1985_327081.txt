Privately , too , he was doing well ; the couple had a net worth of about $4 million , stemming largely from his New York real estate business . But in the glare of the Ferraro campaign , his financial dealings came under harsh scrutiny . Last week Zaccaro was arrested and ushered into Manhattan Criminal Court , where he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge . An indictment accused Zaccaro of scheming to defraud during a deal in which he and a partner tried to buy five Queens apartment buildings . In a plea-bargaining arrangement , Zaccaro admitted to two specific allegations : that he had tampered with a copy of an appraisal and that he had kited his net worth to $21.6 million . He could be fined up to $1,000 . There is a chance that his real estate license might be suspended . <P> Ferraro , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the violations " technical . " But some political consultants thought she had been damaged . " She 's in great difficulty , " said New York 's David Garth . " But it 's possible to come back . "
