Reagan has some talented prospects to run his Administration <P> You want to know what the Administration will be like ? " asks William Casey , Ronald Reagan 's campaign manager . " It will be very much like Eisenhower 's . You 'll see people of experience , people of heavier weight than have been around since then . More authority will be delegated to the Cabinet , and the White House staff wo n't have such a heavy hand . " <P> The President-elect , who is famed for keeping reasonable hours and not getting bogged down in details , is expected to act pretty much like a chairman of the board who makes the big decisions but delegates day-to-day operations to others . Thus the people Reagan brings into office are likely to have larger-than-usual roles in running the Government . For several weeks , a group headed by Reagan 's attorney , William French Smith , has been putting together a list of possible appointees for the main posts . Leading candidates for some of the top jobs : <P> Secretary of State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the Treasury under Nixon , is favored for the post . Shultz has had considerable experience in government and the academic world , and is now vice chairman of Bechtel Inc. , the giant construction company . Shultz has never held a diplomatic post , but a Reagan adviser notes that " diplomacy is applied common sense . " Another possibility for State : General Alexander Haig , who as chief of NATO demonstrated diplomatic ability , as well as a firm grasp of geopolitics . <P> Although Reagan says that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger does not want a regular job in the new Administration , he is still considered a long-shot candidate for his old post . Reagan now consults Kissinger on foreign policy , although he used to criticize his policies . But by appointing Kissinger , Reagan would risk outraging his right-wing supporters , who are already upset by the re-emergence of the architect of dtente . <P> Secretary of Defense . Since Reagan needs at least one big-name Democrat in his Cabinet , a natural choice ( Nixon also considered him for the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a strong military . Another like-minded Democrat is Georgia Senator Sam Nunn . Still another possibility is Haig , although there would have to be a change in the law that prohibits any officer from becoming Defense Secretary until he has been off the active-duty list for ten years . Haig retired in June 1979 . <P> Secretary of the Treasury . Alan Greenspan , who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford and helped reduce double-digit inflation to less than 5% , is a leading contender . Another is Caspar Weinberger , who was Reagan 's first finance director in Sacramento and who also served as Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare under Nixon .
