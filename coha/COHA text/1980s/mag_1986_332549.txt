China took another step in its long march toward a market economy last week . Signaling its desire to become a full-fledged member of the world economic community , Peking officially announced that it would seek to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the 91-nation group that works to lower trade barriers and sets the rules of international commerce . Western companies eager to crack the vast Chinese market are delighted . Says Bruce Vernor , executive vice president of the National Council for U.S.-China Trade , a group of 400 American firms : " We certainly believe this is another indication of China 's commitment to an open-door policy . " <P> When GATT was formed in 1947 , China was a member of the Geneva-based organization , but the country dropped out in 1950 , after its Communist revolution . The move to return to the fold is part of Deng Xiaoping 's bold campaign to decentralize the Chinese economy . Under his leadership , China has boosted its imports and exports from $29 billion worth in 1979 to $59 billion last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Soviet bloc countries , but now 80% of it is with the non-Communist world , especially the U.S. and such Asian neighbors as Japan and Hong Kong . China has become a significant exporter of oil , textiles , clothing and spices , while importing such goods as steel , factory equipment and heavy-duty construction machinery . <P> Even in the Deng era , though , Chinese trade remains encumbered by protectionist regulations . All imports of machine tools , for example , must be approved by a special committee , which determines if the equipment could be manufactured in China . If it could , the import is not permitted . Tariffs can be equally tough : the levy on foreign autos is 230% . At the moment , China is strictly limiting imports because of concern about its trade deficit , which ballooned from $1.4 billion in 1984 to $13.7 billion last year . Moreover , Peking two weeks ago devalued its currency by 15.8% against the U.S. dollar . That could discourage imports by making them more expensive . <P> No one thinks that Peking 's bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western diplomat in Peking : " We all know the Chinese are not interested in facilitating trade . They are interested in facilitating exports . " Trade experts think that several years of delicate negotiations lie ahead before GATT members admit China to the club . The Chinese , for instance , may request special treatment as a developing nation . Nevertheless , the fact that China has asked to sit down at the bargaining table with its trading partners is a promising omen .
