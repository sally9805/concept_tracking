 | Not long ago , a popular way to dismiss a painting was to stare for a moment , shrug and then murmur , " Decorative . " Artists today might consider that a compliment . In the last few years the decorative has become fashionable . Feminists have championed the work of women , who have traditionally been confined to the decorative arts , and a strong decorative current has emerged in painting . This makes the retrospective in Buffalo , N.Y. , of the art of Sonia Delaunay especially timely . Delaunay , who died in Paris last year at the age of 94 , has often been dismissed for being too decorative ; her husband , Robert , who painted in a similar style , has overshadowed her . Organized by Robert T. Buck Jr. , director of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery , this exhibif offers a fresh look : it includes more than 200 of Sonia Delaunay 's works , ranging from paintings to tapestries and costumes . DeIaunay was not a great artist ; she Dance costume : A talent to amuse could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transcendent sense of form color . But she was important . Her work elegantly embodied the conviction that should welcome wholeheartedly the modern machine age , while also drawing closer to life itself . As a result , her varied work seemed all of a piece : an ambitious painting such as " Rhythm " ( 1946 ) speaks in the same tone of voice as a costume for a Diaghilev ballet . This did not diminish painting : it elevated the decorative arts . With her husband , Sonia developed a style , sometimes called orphism , that was a spin-off of cubism . The Delaunays broke down light into its constituent colors and then , by contrasting the colors , created a shimmering sense of light and movement . This was essential to their view of the mission of art . They were inspired , not frightened , by the flux of modern life . They loved airplanes , electric lights and the Eiffel Tower . The word they thought best described their art was " simultaneity . " Expressionist Edge : Sonia was raised in Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avant-garde circles . She married Robert in 1910 . Her early work was influenced by the Fauves ; some of her pictures from this period have an expressionist edge that contrasts with the gaiety of her later work . Her first show was in 1908 ; she did not exhibit her paintings again in any number until 1953 , twelve years after her husband 's death . Although she would not compete with her husband , Sonia painted throughout her life . The paintings reflect her study of the shower of electric light on Parisian boulevards and the rhythm of dancers at the Bal Bullier , a Parisian dance hall . The paintings often contain a number of circles or half-circles , reminiscent of the sun or glowing lights . Lines of color radiate from these centers like light that has been splintered by a prism . The pictures are carefully balanced , however , and not only through the weighting of color . An orb of color , within a concentric circle , may be slippery , but it is also a center of gravity , like a revolving planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sonia applied the theories to their daily life : she decorated everyday objects around them ? a wooden box , for example ? according to the principles of simultaneity . Her natural painting style , which was flatter than Robert 's , was well suited to this . In 1911 , she sewed a quilt for her child that some people consider a brilliant precursor of cubist collage . " Before World War I broke out , Robert had shot off rockets in every way , " she said . " I , on the ground , had lit more intimate and ephemeral fires in everyday life , all the while silently pursuing the profound work . " The Delaunay household also became a " simultaneous " work of art : it was a gathering place for the avant-garde . Sonia often collaborated with poets , making book bindings or adding accents of color and form around their words , as in her brilliant collaboration with the poet Blaise Cendrars in his " Prose of the Trans-Siberian Express . " In the ' 20s and ' 30s , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed Robert in a " simultaneous " outfit that included different-colored shoes . In her later life , she designed everything from playing cards to plates . What she called " the sensuous song of color " was meant to " make homes livable , bodies alive . . . it can be the dress of books , the skin of objects , the harlequin driving away ugliness . " Abstraction : Delaunay 's art partakes of many of the contrary obsessions of artists in this century . She was part of the radical drive to purify and elevate art through abstraction ; at the same time , she helped direct art toward the gently decorative ? a natural development , since decoration is itself generally abstract . She was part of an avant-garde that often disdained the bourgeoisie , yet she also became , for a time , a great commercial success . She celebrated the modern , yet loved folk art . She prized individual genius , but she wanted , like the artists of the Bauhaus , to make art broadly useful . " I always painted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " But this amusement took my whole life . " @# @#
