OLD HANDS // Phoenix wide receiver J.T. Smith , who turns 34 on Sunday , not only leads the league in catches , with 54 so far this year , but also has more receptions since the start of the 1986 season than anyone else . Yet in 1985 , Kansas City thought he was at the end of the line . Smith was being used mainly as a punt returner and had caught only 25 passes over the three previous seasons . Chiefs coach John Mackovic heeded Smith 's pleas and waived him in the team 's next-to-last preseason cuts of ' 85 . He was almost 30 . Smith then sat by the phone . " That was the worst couple of weeks of my life , " he says . " I did n't sleep well . " After the Cardinals suffered a spate of injuries , they signed Smith on Sept. 17 , 1985 , and the results have been phenomenal . Since then , according to the Elias Sports Bureau , Smith has caught more passes after turning 30 than all but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kansas City , I rested , " says Smith . " I added at least two years to my career . " Here are the league 's leading receivers after their 30th birthday : // Player // Receptions // Yards // Avg.Yards Per Catch // Age at Retirement // 1 .

Pete Retzlaff // 294 // 4,946 // 16.8 // 34 // THE PLAYERS VOTE // NFL players are conservative when it comes to football-related issues , according to an SI poll of 617 of the league 's veterans . Largely because of statements by leaders of the NFL Players Association , the public perception is that the players oppose random drug testing and that their top priority in negotiations with management is liberalizing free agency . But our survey contradicts that impression . Seventy-two percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than free agency , should be the NFLPA 's No. 1 bargaining priority , and 59% said they supported random testing for drugs . // Those views should n't be taken to mean there 's a revolt brewing against the union . Although the players have gone 26 months without a collective-bargaining agreement with team owners , 68% said that they rated the NFLPA 's overall performance as good . And by a 51%-39% margin , players said they approved of the job Gene Upshaw was doing as the union 's executive director . " I think your poll shows we 're not going to go away and the league 's not going to eat us up , " says Upshaw . " I think it says the union 's doing very well . " // In the unscientific survey , which was taken in August and early September , SI asked an average of 23 nonrookie players per team to answer 11 questions about their sport ( box , right ) , three of which directly concerned their views of the performance of the NFLPA . The questions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jets and the Giants , to ask their teammates not to respond to the poll , and they complied . Thus 26 of the 28 NFL teams are represented . Here is a further sampling of what we found out : // ? The players have mixed views on Upshaw , but they do n't blame the NFLPA for the lack of a bargaining agreement . " I think if you 'd taken this poll last week , you 'd have gotten a different result , because I 've visited 10 teams in the last two weeks , " said Upshaw last Friday . " I believe the players tell me the truth when I 'm alone in rooms with them . They know I 'm in there fighting for them . " Still , the players are frequently said to be apathetic about union affairs , and Upshaw says , " I do n't know how many of the players really know what I do . " // ? The players are ambivalent about free agency . When Upshaw held private team meetings before calling the 1987 strike , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , after going two years without an agreement and knowing that the latest figures of the NFL Management Council show that the average NFL playing career is only 4.05 years , the players seem to be more benefits conscious . Already the average player 's deductible for medical benefits is about $200 a year more than it was before the expiration of the collective-bargaining agreement , and as of this season the teams have cut off their contribution of roughly $10,000 a year toward severance pay for each vested veteran . Those factors may explain why only 19% called free agency the most important issue . ' That really surprises me , " says Upshaw . " What that whole question says to me is they do n't understand the problem . I do n't think they truly understand what they gain with free agency . " // But Jack Donlan , executive director of the Management Council says , " This poll is not surprising . What we 've heard all along from players and clubs is that free agency is n't the will of the players but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their support for random drug testing . " Let the public see that 98 , 99 percent of the players are n't taking drugs , " says Packer center James Campen , echoing a sentiment expressed by many of his peers . Even the union seems to be softening its stand . Last Thursday , Upshaw came away from a meeting with a drug-testing firm encouraged that new methods might satisfy the NFLPA 's concern over the reliability and security of drug tests . The union has said it does n't trust the league 's present testing system . // The NFL now tests players once a year , in the preseason , with further tests permitted only if a player has already tested positive or if a team can demonstrate reasonable cause for suspicion . The league would like more frequent testing but is prohibited from instituting it by an arbitrator 's ruling in 1986 . " If that 's all that 's going to be done , it 's a paper tiger , " says Falcon linebacker Tim Green , referring to the current once-a-year system . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin , the players favor retaining instant replay as an aid to officials . Their support for the system may be even stronger than the owners ' . // ? The players strongly favor the NFL 's plan to create an international league , because it would mean additional jobs . // ? Although the players showed no consensus when asked to name the premier offensive player in the game and which coach they would most like to play for , they cited Eagle end Reggie White by a stunning three-to-one margin as the league 's best defensive player . // JUST WIN NOW , BABY After Sunday 's 23-12 defeat of the Bengals , the Colts were 19-14 in the two years since they decided to play for today . In the last 24 months , Indy obtained running back Eric Dickerson from the Rams , linebacker Fredd Young from the Seahawks and linebacker Chip Banks from the Chargers . To get them , the Colts gave up their rights to linebacker Cornelius Bennett ; No. 1 draft picks in ' 88 , ' 89 and ' 90 ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came from San Diego on Oct. 17 after missing the first six weeks of the season in drug rehab  --  is perhaps the strongest indication of Indy 's win-now mind-set . Most teams would n't have touched Banks , who started Sunday . Here are the particulars of the deal : If he stays drug free until April 10 , 1990 , and the Colts decide to keep him , Indianapolis will have the choice of sending San Diego a second-round pick in ' 91 or a third-round pick in ' 90 . If Banks is waived by that date , the Colts will send San Diego a fourth-round pick in ' 90 . " There 's no question we 're rolling the dice , " says Colt general manager Jimmy Irsay . " But to me , the downside is n't that big . If he plays well , it 's a great deal for us . If he does n't , he 'll cost us just one of three fourth-round picks we have in 1990. " // DISPATCHES In Sunday night 's conclusion to ESPN 's computer-based NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the ' 78 Steelers for the mythical title of best team ever . Tight end Jim Mandich is the only guy to have played for both teams . He went to Pittsburgh after Miami waived him in ' 78 . " I have no doubt the Dolphins were superior , " says Mandich , now a construction-company executive and sportscaster in Miami . " Those two teams did play , sort of . We went to Pittsburgh in December 1972 , and the Steelers ' nucleus was in place . They were playing great football . We beat them 21-17 . " Mandich may think Pittsburgh 's nucleus was in place by ' 72 , but Lynn Swann , John Stallworth , Mike Webster and Jack Lambert were all two years away from joining the team .... Will Green Bay tackle Tony Mandarich be switched to the defensive line , as some observers have speculated recently ? " I do n't know where that one came from , but it 's absolutely untrue , " says Packer coach Lindy Infante .... In 1983 , the Broncos obtained the rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , the trade still has n't been completed . Indy received quarterback Mark Herrmann , offensive lineman Chris Hinton and a first-round draft selection in ' 84 for Elway . The Colts used the pick to get guard Ron Solt , whom they traded last season to Philadelphia for a first-round draft pick in ' 89  --  which they used to choose wide receiver Andre Rison  --  and a fourth-rounder in ' 90 . So it will be at least seven years after the Elway trade before we 'll be able to evaluate it fully .... What a Long Strange Season It 's Been Dept. : The Dolphins have three guys with more sacks than anyone on the Bears has .
