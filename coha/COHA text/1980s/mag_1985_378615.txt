Elsewhere , the demonstration would barely have attracted notice . Several hundred university students , singing broken choruses of their national anthem and shouting slogans like " Long Live the Great People , " massed in a corner of Peking 's Tiananmen Square last week . They were protesting among other things Japanese " economic aggression , " Tokyo 's reputed flooding of China with defective and overpriced goods under the open-door economic policies of Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping . Security officials with loudspeakers ordered the protesters to disperse , and after about two hours they did . <P> It was the second anti-Japanese student protest in two months . In both cases , the ostensible purpose was to refresh Chinese memories of Japan 's harsh military presence in China from 1931 to 1945 . The events were also timed to coincide with two Sino-Japanese competitions in volleyball and an Oriental game called go . But the dissident students gave their protest an additional twist by dubbing the rally Democracy ' 85 . In a manifesto circulated before the demonstration , organizers declared that " it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducive democratic atmosphere . " University authorities responded with a series of public meetings to criticize the manifesto and discourage students from joining the protest . <P> The fact that so many demonstrators showed up despite the official pressure is a sign that campus discontent in Peking goes beyond anti-Japanese sentiments . Many students resent the fact that the benefits of Deng 's reformist economic policies have gone to members of a Chinese elite that includes the well-connected children of Communist officials . The favored youth have a far better chance than most of getting good jobs or traveling abroad after graduation . Faced with a steep rise in the cost of living as a result of the reforms , many students are finding their already spartan daily lives less and less tolerable . Says a Peking university student : " Peasants are getting rich , workers get bonuses , but we still get our measly fixed allowance . " <P> Some diplomats believe that the protests have been encouraged by Communist Party conservatives who are still fighting a rearguard action against Deng 's reforms . Others accuse the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever the reason , it may not have been a coincidence that the Peking government last week announced plans to remove , in the interests of beautification , the large billboards that advertise Japanese products along the capital 's main avenue .
