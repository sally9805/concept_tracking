Because he publicly criticized the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Dissident Physicist Andrei Sakharov spent nearly seven years of internal exile in the closed city of Gorky . At a ceremony in Moscow last week inducting him into the French Academy of Sciences , Sakharov , who was allowed to return home last December , accused fellow members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences of spreading " cock-and-bull stories " about his supposedly " tranquil life " in Gorky . On the contrary , he said , he suffered psychological torture and frequent harassment while in exile . Despite the current policy of glasnost ( openness ) , a newspaper account of the ceremony did not mention Sakharov 's remarks .
