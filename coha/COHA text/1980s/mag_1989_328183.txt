If a computer were to design the ideal President to deal with Mikhail Gorbachev , it might whir and buzz and come up with George Bush . As Ambassador to the United Nations , Bush got to know the folkways of the world forum where Gorbachev has been concentrating much of his genius for public diplomacy . As the U.S. 's man in China , Bush had a crash course in Communism and geopolitics . As director of Central Intelligence , he learned what KGB networks and Soviet missile warheads could do to the West on a bad day . As Vice President , he met as many General Secretaries as he helped bury ( three ) . <P> Bush is genuinely fascinated by Soviet affairs . He has frequently held private weekend seminars with experts on the subject , and he chose card- carrying Kremlinologists for the top two jobs on the National Security Council staff . One of the first documents Bush signed as President was an order to the Executive Branch to reassess relations and recommend a strategy that looks ahead to the next century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gorbachev 's " new thinking . " Yet to meet that challenge , the study may have to work its way free of attitudes and assumptions that could make fresh initiatives difficult . <P> Part of the problem is that Bush 's Administration came into office on probation in the eyes of the Republican hard right and wary of appearing susceptible to Gorbomania . Some members of the new team seem to relish the chance to sound tougher than their predecessors . A number of Bush aides have privately derided Ronald Reagan for his arm-in-arm stroll through Red Square with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last June and for proclaiming the Evil Empire a thing of the past . <P> Some of these advisers also seem convinced that what forced the Soviet Union to begin mending its aggressive , repressive ways was U.S. pressure of the past 40 years , so no change in U.S. policy is in order now . This line of argument underestimates the internal origins of Soviet reform . Gorbachev is not so much saying " uncle " to Uncle Sam as he is addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so in a way that is earning him worldwide credit for being flexible and forward-looking , while the U.S. is in danger of appearing sluggish and uncertain . <P> Yet the Bush Administration seems eager to play down the importance of Gorbachev himself . It is only prudent , of course , to hedge against the possibility of Gorbachev 's demise . But the Administration risks going too far in assuming , imprudently , that favorable trends in Soviet domestic and foreign policy are irreversible  --  no matter who the General Secretary is  --  and not far enough in taking advantage of the immediate opportunities that Gorbachev himself represents . For example , his willingness to trim Soviet military muscle might give the U.S. a welcome chance to rethink some of its own more expensive superweapons . <P> The Administration needs and deserves time to prepare its approach . The policy review is still a work in progress . But it would be a shame if it ended up being a rationalization for American old thinking and an all-purpose , platitudinous prescription for dealing not with Gorbachev but his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
