" The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and as a people , " it declared . " If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today , we might well have viewed it as an act of war . As it stands , we have allowed this to happen to ourselves. " // The commission was appointed in August 1981 by T.H. Bell , the Secretary of Education , to address what he termed " the widespread public perception that something is seriously remiss in our educational system . " The project , which cost $785 , 000 , was financed by the Department of Education. // Mr. Bell said the department would now " hold meetings all across the country " to promote a " commitment to excellence " in education . These were some of the changes the commission urged : // - High schools should tighten requirements in the " new basics " - English , mathematics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and universities should raise their admissions requirements in these areas as well as in foreign languages. // - Students should spend more time in school . School boards should consider extending the school day from six to a total of seven hours and increasing the school year from 180 to as many as 220 days. // - High school students should be given " far more homework. " // - Salaries for teachers should be increased , and their contracts should be extended from 9 to 11 months to allow time for curriculum planning and helping students with special needs. // - Financial incentives should be used to attract " outstanding students " into the teaching profession , and " master teachers " should be used to train them. // The commission did not offer recommendations in several areas that have been priorities of the Reagan Administration , including tuition tax credits , prayer in the schools and abolition of the Department of Education. // In his remarks late this afternoon at a White House ceremony in which he was given a copy of the report , however , President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the months ahead for passage of tuition tax credits , vouchers , educational savings accounts , voluntary school prayer and abolishing the Department of Education. " // The commission urged American citizens to provide " the fiscal support and stability " necessary to bring about these reforms . " Excellence costs , " it declared . " But in the long run mediocrity costs far more. " // Beyond this appeal , the report did not address the question of how to pay for changes such as higher teachers ' salaries . " We were not asked to offer any advice on how to finance education , " said David P. Gardner , president of the University of Utah and chairman of the commission , at a news briefing . <> <> Comments About Financing // Much of the initial reaction to the 36-page report focused on how the proposed reforms might be financed . The National Education Association , the country ' s largest teachers organization , called the document " exciting " and said the panel ' s recommendations would require " additional billions of dollars - and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping objectives. " // Representative Carl D. Perkins , the Democrat from Kentucky who is chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee , said he was glad to see recommendations such as increasing teachers ' salaries but added that the report came " after three years of Administration efforts to cut back on education programs. " // " I believe the President ought to take a signal from this report and put an end to his questioning of whether the Federal Government should be involved in education , " he said . <> <> Responsibilities Discussed // The report said state and local officials have the " primary responsibility for financing and governing the schools " but added that the Federal Government shares responsibility for meeting the needs of gifted , handicapped , disadvantaged and bilingual students . The Federal Government also has " the primary responsibility to identify the national interest in education , " it said. // At the ceremony this afternoon , Mr. Reagan interpreted the commission ' s position as a " call for an end to Federal intrusion , " adding that that " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education. " // The commission staff , which was headed by Milton Goldberg , surveyed existing educational research and commissioned its own studies on topics such as curriculum trends and how American students fare in relation to those of other countries . It also held hearings at which students , teachers , school officials and other citizens were invited to testify. // In its report , entitled " A Nation at Risk : the Imperative for Educational Reform , " the commission presented a wide range of evidence that the quality of American education has been deteriorating over the last two decades . <> <> Declining Test Scores // The document noted , for example , that achievement test scores of both high school and college graduates have been declining consistently and that there has been a " steady decline in science achievement scores of American 17-year-olds as measured by national assessments of science in 1969 , 1973 and 1977. " // The report said that " some 23 million American adults are functionally illiterate by the simplest tests of everyday reading , writing and comprehension , " and it quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its recent recruits can not read at the ninth-grade level , the minimum needed simply to understand written safety instructions. " ' // The commission said low educational standards constitute a serious problem when the United States must compete against other countries with sophisticated economic and educational systems . " Learning is the indispensable investment required for success in the ' information age ' we are entering , " it stressed. // Copies of " A Nation at Risk " may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents , U.S. Government Printing Office , Washington , D.C. 20402 .
