DETROIT  --  General Motors Corp. ' s decision to reorganize the way it makes and sells cars has touched off a race for the presidency between two of the company ' s most respected and fastest-moving executives : Robert Stempel and Lloyd Reuss . " The pistol at the starting line just went off , " a senior GM official said yesterday . " And there are only two guys in the race . " Mr. Stempel and Mr. Reuss yesterday each were named to head one of the two new groups that will be responsible for developing , manufacturing and selling GM cars . Mr. Stempel , the 50-year-old general manager of GM ' s Chevrolet division , was picked to head the company ' s new **25;0;TOOLONG group , which will be responsible for regular and large-size cars . Mr. Reuss , 47 , will move from his job as head of GM ' s Buick division to take charge of the new Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada group , which will make small cars . Insiders at GM speculated that whichever of the two executives does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into line to succeed F. James McDonald , GM ' s 61-year-old president . GM traditionally has chosen its president from the ranks of executives with operating experience , while its chairman has been selected from among candidates in the finance staff . The heir apparent to Roger Smith , GM ' s chairman , is F. Alan Smith , who at age 52 is already the fourth highest ranking officer in the company as executive vice president , finance . Although Mr. Stempel and Mr. Reuss get almost equal praise from within the company , their operating styles are quite different . While Mr. Stempel is more introspective and deliberate , Mr. Reuss is hard-charging and direct . Mr. Stempel gained his first wide attention in GM when , as a transmission design engineer , he was instrumental in leading the development of GM ' s first front-wheel-drive car , the Oldsmobile Toronado . That experience later helped make him an invaluable executive as GM and the industry began its broad conversion to front-wheel-drive vehicles . In 1978 , Mr. Stempel became one of GM ' s youngest-ever division heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also gained important international experience two years later when he was sent to Germany to help turn around GM ' s sagging Adam Opel division . There , he guided the launching of a new subcompact and new minicar that have since gained significant increases in market share for Opel . " Bob has an incredible grasp of the automobile from the ground up , " said one subordinate . " He ' s one of the few people in the corporation who has the knowledge and the ability to practically design a car all by himself . " As head of GM ' s Buick division for the past three years , Mr. Reuss has rapidly enhanced his image as a quick-thinking and forceful executive with a strong taste for new ideas . During that time , Buick ' s sales gains have significantly outpaced the industry  --  a fact that many GM insiders attribute to Mr. Reuss ' s efforts to give the division ' s cars a more sporty and less stodgy appeal . He also impressed his superiors with his plans for Buick City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Reuss hoped to convert to Japanese-style inventory methods . The two executives were told in early November that they each would head one of the two groups , but neither knew until recently which one . " They were interchangeable individuals , " Roger Smith , the chairman , said at a news conference yesterday . Nevertheless , of the two assignments , Mr. Reuss seems to have been given the more difficult . GM has had a long history of difficulties in the small-car market and the competition there is the toughest . " We are going to have to reexamine and change every link in the chain for small-car development , " Mr. Reuss said in an interview . " It is going to be a major challenge . " Curiously , the one dark moment in Mr. Reuss ' s career involved small cars . In 1970 , he was chief engineer for the Chevrolet Vega  --  one of a string of disappointing small cars from GM . The reorganization moves GM announced yesterday also involved a number of other top level changes . Alexander Cunningham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president in charge of North American passenger car operations and a director of the company . Mr. Cunningham , who previously was vice president and group executive in charge of the body and assembly group , will be succeeded by Charles Katko , 58 , who will remain general manager of the Fisher Body division as it is phased out . The new head of Chevrolet will be Robert D. Burger , 59 , who moves over from general manager of Cadillac . Replacing Mr. Reuss at Buick will be Donald E. Hackworth , 46 , formerly general manager of General Motors of Canada Ltd . The Canadian job will go to John F. Smith Jr. , 45 , previously director of GM ' s world-wide product planning group . John O. Grettenberger , meanwhile , was named the new general manager of Cadillac . Mr. Grettenberger , 46 , formerly was director of product , strategic and business planning at Oldsmobile .
