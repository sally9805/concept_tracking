" It was n't my intention for him to do it as a film , " recalls Nora Ephron , 44 . " I just wanted him to read it . " But Director Mike Nichols , 53 , thought Heartburn , Ephron 's best-selling novel that resembles the breakup of her marriage to Watergate Journalist Carl Bernstein , 41 , would make a good movie , and the rest , as they say , is history , or maybe her-story . Now filming in New York City , Heartburn stars Meryl Streep , 35 , as the jilted cookbook writer , and Jack Nicholson , 48 , as the man who gives her marital indigestion . Nicholson is replacing Mandy Patinkin , 32 , who departed suddenly after " artistic differences " with the director . So what is the movie based on the book based on the breakup about ? Says Nichols : " It 's about how tough and funny it is to live in a big city and try to love somebody . " Not to mention make a movie . <P> Even rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth the Queen Mother celebrated her 85th birthday . Accompanied by her daughters Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret , the birthday girl started her various celebrations at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham , where the organist ended the service by striking up a rousing Happy Birthday . The next day , the traditional 62-gun birthday salute was fired at Hyde Park and the Tower of London . But the best present came when the Queen Mum got her long-standing wish to fly aboard the Concorde . During her nearly two-hour specially chartered flight over Britain , she dined on Scottish lobster and Angus beef and sipped her favorite champagne . Then she was strapped into a seat behind the pilot as he accelerated beyond the sound barrier to 1,340 m.p.h . Mum 's word : " Incredible . " <P> The idea clicked last December in Rio de Janeiro , where Supermodel Jerry Hall was posing for Photographer Annie Leibovitz for the March ' 85 cover of Vanity Fair . The session went so well that the pair decided to do a 1986 pinup calendar . There was no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of the photographs . Hall 's seasonal poses run from a vision in lace ( January ) to Aunt Sam ( July ) to a Christmas gift ( December ) . Observes Leibovitz of Mick Jagger 's lady : " Jerry loves the camera . " And vice versa . <P> He looks wise , or at least wised-up , beyond his years , and why not ? If anyone should be used to life in the passing lane , it is Bret Easton Ellis , 21 . Since his first novel , Less Than Zero , was published in May , it has sold 50,000 copies and made several best-seller lists . Ellis , meanwhile , has become a cult celebrity , showing up on Today , Firing Line and MTV . Not bad for someone who just completed his junior year at Bennington College in Vermont . Ellis ' book , set in the affluent Los Angeles suburbs where he grew up , chronicles a few days in the lives of a group of teenagers burned out on sex and drugs . " It can be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he concedes . " A lot of teenagers hunger to be in that kind of group . " As for the grownup pressures of his new success , he says straitlacedly , " You just have to keep writing . If you let stuff like that get in your head , you 'll never write another word .
