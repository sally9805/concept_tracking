After weeks of earnest prodding from the Vatican , the Rev. Billy Graham has decided to accept an invitation for a joint September speaking appearance with Pope John Paul II in Columbia , S.C . The meeting , which will be attended by two dozen other ecumenical leaders , will mark the first time that Graham , the world 's best-known Protestant , has preached alongside a Pope . It will also be John Paul 's first important acknowledgment of the evangelical movement . Some conservative Protestants who are hostile to Roman Catholicism urged Graham to stay away ; indeed , the president of Graham 's denomination , the Southern Baptist Convention , is bypassing the event . But Graham may feel an obligation toward the Pope , who , as Karol Cardinal Wojtyla , permitted the evangelist to speak in a major Cracow church in 1978 . Graham faces a tight schedule : a week after the ecumenical encounter , he will pay his first visit to China .                   @ @
