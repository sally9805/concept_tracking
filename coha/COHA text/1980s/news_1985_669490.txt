Mr. DeBolt , a political consultant , devised strategy for the GOP candidate for governor , Wyatt Durrette , in last month ' s elections in Virginia . Mr. Durrette lost . But it was no ordinary defeat , in the view of some politicians , both Democrats and Republicans . This was something special. // // In winning , Virginia ' s Democrats achieved three things where others have failed. // First , they avoided cozying up to all those special-interest groups , like labor unions and those who are pro-choice on abortion. // Second , they did everything they could to fracture Virginia ' s Republican Party by splitting conservatives and moderates. // Third , they wrapped their arms around the political center , and wouldn ' t let go. // It worked . And the results have sent a small tremor through Republican ranks across the United States. // DeBolt , president of the DCM Group , a consulting firm in Arlington , Va. , had a front-row seat for the battle and concedes that the Democrats ran a first-rate show . But Republicans should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic victory here was seen as crucial . The party is looking for ways to counter the next Republican offensive , which GOP officials have dubbed , ' ' The Reagan Revolution , Part II. ' ' // Republicans are hoping to grab governorships ( they now have only 16 ) , state legislatures , and county courthouses . All these would be stepping stones to taking control of the House of Representatives in 1992. // Democrats , staggered by their 49-state loss in the Reagan-Mondale election , are searching for ways to fight back . Virginia may have provided some of the answers. // One reason is that Virginia highlighted a GOP weakness . If the noisy , demanding right wing of the party , led by such conservatives as the Rev. Jerry Falwell , can be split away from the larger Republican center , the result can wreak all sorts of damage. // It also shows Democrats are getting smarter. // To DeBolt ' s chagrin , these Democrats - 1985-style - talk like Republicans , walk like Republicans , and look like Republicans . And they win. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from President Reagan , Virginia Democrats swept the races for governor , lieutenant governor , and attorney general. // DeBolt ' s Republican candidate , Durrette , managed to narrow the gap with Democrat Jerry Baliles as the race came to an end . But it wasn ' t enough. // What happened ? Have the Democrats found a new secret victory formula ? Is it something they could package and sell across the United States in 1986 - and 1988 ? // Well , even liberal Democrats , such as national party chairman Paul Kirk , have taken note . Mr. Kirk told reporters at breakfast the other day that Virginia showed that Democrats can win if they emphasize issues of broad , common interest , rather than narrow ones. // Earlier , Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. , the Republican national chairman , had warned his party ' s governors that GOP hopes across the country could be dashed next year if other Democrats follow Virginia ' s lead. // DeBolt , a veteran of many campaigns , explains what happened . And what Republicans can do about it. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . But the lessons of Virginia could give Democrats a running start for 1986 and ' 88 . He says the Democratic victory here had two key elements. // // * Democrats , led by their incumbent governor , Charles Robb , played good old-fashioned moderate Southern Democratic politics . They grabbed the political center where most voters are and carefully steered clear of liberal activists such as labor unions. // // * Republicans allowed the right wing , led by the Rev. Mr. Falwell and former Gov . Mills Godwin , to dominate strategy for too long . By September , the Republicans were too far behind to recover . A quarter-million Republicans and Republican-leaning independents , unimpressed by the GOP campaign , failed to vote. // Political insiders considered both candidates to be moderates . But the public view was less clear-cut. // Republican Durrette found himself linked in Democratic TV ads with Mr. Falwell - a distinct minus in Virginia politics . The image hit home . Meanwhile , Democrat Baliles went all-out with TV ads and joint appearances to become closely associated in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrewdest moves by Democrats , DeBolt says , was to avoid any association with the party ' s left wing . And that , he adds , took courage . DeBolt explains : // Baliles ' ' quietly passed the word to the AFL-CIO that he did not want their endorsement . Very , very smart in a state that doesn ' t like AFL-CIO . . . . Later , he made every effort to make sure he was not encumbered with ( pro-choice ) abortion group support , and he wasn ' t encumbered with . . . some of the environmentalists who cause trouble. ' ' // There ' s little doubt that if other Democrats copy what happened here , it will make the GOP ' s job much harder , DeBolt says . Yet what happened here is not that new . Democratic leaders merely returned their party to its roots among millions of conservative and moderate Democrats . Those Democrats have often been ignored since the Vietnam war as the party leadership tried to mollify activist liberals . Conservatives in the party turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle will now be over the center , where most votes are , DeBolt says . This means Republicans , just as Democrats did in Virginia , will have to say ' ' no ' ' to the more radical elements in their party. // Another DeBolt candidate in Virginia , US Sen. John Warner , did that , and got 70 percent of the vote in his last election . ' ' We did not cozy up to the Falwells , ' ' DeBolt says . ' ' We retained our independence on many issues that revolved around race. . . . ' ' // ' ' You need the courage to confront those people , ' ' DeBolt says . ' ' If they say , ' I ' m not going to support you , ' then say , ' Sayonara . ' . . . It ' s not easy to tell your friends to take a walk ( but ) until the Republican Party has the courage to tell its splinter groups that they can ' t dominate the entire animal . . . we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // //
