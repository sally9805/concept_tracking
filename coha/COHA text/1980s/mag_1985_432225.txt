 | This is the drug that LSD was supposed to be , coming 20 years too late to change the world . It is called MDMA ? or " Ecstasy " ? and users say it has the incredible power to make people trust one another , to banish jealousy and to break down the barriers that separate lover from lover , parent from child , therapist from patient . Yet unlike LSD , it does not also break down one 's ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy , so that it appears free of many of that drug 's unfortunate side effects . A New York writer who tried it compares it to " a year of therapy in two hours . " A Benedictine monk from Big Sur , Brother David Steindl-Rast , says " a monk spends his whole life cultivating the same awakened attitude it gives you . " Of course , not everyone is taking it for the insights it provides . It has become popular over the last two years on college campuses , where it is considered an aphrodisiac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or more doses a day to achieve an amphetaminelike high . Apparently the nation is on the verge either of a tremendous breakthrough in consciousness or a lot more kids too strung out to come in from the rain . Thinking : Ecstasy is another drug that has escaped from the laboratory into the streets . It began in the 1970s as a therapy ( like LSD did in the 1950s ) and was picked up by healthy people because it felt so good . Although the drug has never received FDA approval , a handful of psychiatrists ? about 30 , according to one authority ? either make it themselves or have it custom-manufactured within their own states . A larger number of therapists are believed to obtain it clandestinely , and these same underground sources , rumored to be in Berkeley , Calif. , Cambridge , Mass. , or Colorado , supply the pills and powder that people take in their living rooms . Ecstasy is not a hallucinogen , and it does n't interfere with thinking . It is not a " party drug , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Casablanca . " Most recreational users take it with friends . They say it relaxes inhibitions and enhances communication ? and sex , though they insist that is not the point of it . Chemically , MDMA ? **29;699;TOOLONG ? is related to both the amphetamines and mescaline , and especially to a potent stimulant known as MDA . Until recently it was of no particular interest to the Drug Enforcement Administration , but with the recent upsurge in street use , the agency has proposed listing MDMA as a " Schedule I " controlled substance ? the category for drugs with no accepted medical use and a high abuse potential , including heroin , LSD and MDA . Therapists fear this would make it virtually impossible to continue using it , even experimentally , and they protested the proposal ? catching the agency by surprise . The doctors working with MDMA have been , if not secretive , at least discreet . Says DEA pharmacologist Frank Sapienza : " We had no idea psychiatrists were using it . " The therapists will have their say at hearings in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MDMA are a little vague about its precise benefits . " It helps people to get in touch with feelings which are ordinarily not available to them , " says Dr. Lester Grinspoon , a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School . " It appears to help people recall things from their past . . . If this is an accurate picture , you might just be able to break up some logjams in therapy with it . " Dr. Rick Ingrasci of Cambridge , who has given the drug to more than 500 patients , says he finds it most useful in " healing fear , " citing one woman with a phobic dread of infections who was cured in one two-hour session with MDMA. -A Santa Fe psychiatrist . Dr. George Greer , says the drug " makes it easier to look at the issues in your life and it brings about a quality of acceptance .

He reported numerous benefits including euphoria , increased energy , greater self-esteem and less use of alcohol and other drugs . Impressionistic results like that only emphasize how untested MDMA really is . Abuse : The therapists report almost no negative side effects when MDMA is taken under supervision ; although , like all amphetamines , Ecstasy is probably bad for people with circulatory or heart disease . Most also seem to agree with Grinspoon 's Harvard colleague Dr. Norman Zinberg. who says he has never seen " a single bad reaction " to MDMA ; " it has quite a low potential for abuse . " Nevertheless , the street kids of San Francisco have figured out how to abuse it , according to Dr. David Smith , director of the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic . It is available on the street , in gelatin capsules or as a loose powder that is sometimes mixed with juice , for between $10 and $30 a 100-milligram dose . Says Smith : " I 'm seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . " The therapists agree that some controls are needed over MDMA ? but they still want it available for clinical use . There is , however , another school of thought , which holds that MDMA ought to be made available for everyone to use . It is the drug of choice of those who identify with the global consciousness and romantic ecology of the " New Age " movement . The Earth Metabolic Design Foundation , a New Age think tank in Berkeley , is backing several research projects on the drug and hopes to have results for the DEA hearings . " I guess , " said Rick Doblin of the foundation , " you can say it 's part of a social movement . " Ecstasy promotes an emotional union with the world at large that users say stays with them long after the drug itself has worn off . This leads some of them to conclude that if everyone took it the world would be a better place . They are aware of the irony that many of the same claims were made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grinspoon believes that the alarm over LSD may have caused people to turn against psychedelic drugs before their value was established .
