Ever since the airlines were deregulated nine years ago and fierce fare wars erupted , some passengers have been concerned that cost-conscious carriers might feel compelled to cut corners on the maintenance of their aircraft . Such fears have reached a new peak amid the recent burst of publicity about airline problems , including numerous unscheduled landings caused by mechanical failures . The Federal Aviation Administration and the airlines firmly deny that safety standards have generally deteriorated under deregulation . But an unflattering spotlight is now being focused on the maintenance practices of one major carrier : Eastern Air Lines . Eastern 's mechanics say they are under enormous pressure from management to work fast on the ground so that planes can spend more time in the air earning money . Supporting that charge , the airline 's pilots since June have written more than 1,000 letters of complaint to the FAA and hundreds to Congress about Eastern 's allegedly sloppy maintenance . <P> Serious accusations have been made by John King , a twelve-year veteran mechanic at Eastern 's Logan Airport maintenance base in Boston , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints he had made to the FAA . Last week King described three incidents that he said occurred in Boston in May : <P>  --  When a new engine was put on Eastern Airbus No. 208 , the normal equipment- installation tests , which typically take several hours , were skipped to free the plane for service . Despite that , King says , the foreman signed a work sheet indicating that the engine had been checked out . <P>  --  Mechanics servicing another Airbus spotted a fuel leak in a pylon connected &lt; to an engine and recommended that it be repaired quickly because of the potential of fire . But a foreman , saying he had not seen the leak , overruled the employees , according to King , and the plane took off . Since the reported leak was not cited in the aircraft 's maintenance record , mechanics at other airports were not alerted to double-check for the problem . <P>  --  At a departure gate , mechanics discovered that a loose bolt had punched a hole in a 727 's fuel tank , causing a leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quick-hardening plastic sealer so that the plane could depart . A supervisor concealed the improper patch job by not recording it in the aircraft 's logbook . The hole was not correctly repaired with a metal plate until later that week . <P> According to King , Eastern foremen have a good reason to defer maintenance : they can earn bonuses for getting planes out of the hangar fast . Under an Eastern incentive program started in January , the airline 's employees set performance goals for themselves , subject to management approval . In the case of the Boston maintenance station , the goal is to make sure that less than 4% of all flights miss their scheduled departure times because of delays resulting from repairs , preflight loading , cleaning or the like . King says one supervisor earned an extra $800 through the incentive program in the first three months of the year . While some airlines offer performance incentives to employees like reservation clerks , Eastern seems to be the only one extending such a program to its mechanics .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
