Acequia Madre may be loosely translated as Mother of Irrigation Ditches : a logical name in a town where water is so precious that to have an irrigation ditch running by your house has historically been a status symbol. // To drive down Acequia Madre , with its tawny pink adobe walls on each side , interrupted by an occasional heavy wooden gate and overhung at intervals with the feathery silver-green of gambel oaks , is to feel how Spanish this city really is . For you can only glimpse the houses of residents on Acequia Madre . They are private , secluded , protected by peaceful desert gardens , by sand-colored walls often three feet thick , by wrought iron bars covering windows in elegant , simple patterns . On this stretch you can glimpse the varied , vivid charm of Santa Fe. // Santa Fe is foreign yet American , sunbaked yet cool , primitive and earthy yet sophisticated and chic : stark simplicity amid a wealth of art , culture , and consumerism. // It was founded when Shakespeare was alive , the tallest buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that glowing , yet delicate , tawny salmon pink. // History buffs , lovers of Indian crafts , gallery-hoppers , window-shoppers , and theater and concert enthusiasts will all be attracted by Santa Fe , proudly described by its tourist board as the City Different. // Santa Fe is ' ' foreign ' ' in that it is more a Spanish , Mexican , and Indian city than an American one . The Spaniards , through their rich and prosperous colony of Mexico , or New Spain , had begun sending explorers and missionary friars into New Mexico before the end of the 16th century . New Mexico was a Spanish colony during the entire 17th and 18th centuries , became Mexican with the independence of that country in 1821 , and only became one of the United States in 1912. // But long before the Spaniards , Mexicans , or Americans , it was the 19 tribes of Pueblo Indians to whom New Mexico belonged . They have been there for at least a thousand years , cultivating the land , building their fortified adobe ' ' apartment ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their incomparable handicrafts. // The very sight of Santa Fe will corroborate this multi-cultured history . Just about every building is of adobe , that sunbaked mud material adopted by the Pueblos centuries ago . It makes for low-lying , flat-topped structures embellished with nothing but the ends of rough-hewn beams . The corners of adobe houses are gently rounded , as if worn down by the persistent desert winds . Many signs of the 20th century , such as billboards and neon , are simply not there. // The temptation to dawdle in the shops around Santa Fe ' s historic square Plaza , or linger among the Indian jewelry-sellers at the Palace of the Governors , is strong . This terrific town boasts more top-flight art than many larger cities , and it literally gleams with silver and turquoise , exquisitely crafted in infinite variations by the Pueblo Indian tribes . You can also be charmed by wonderful Indian pottery and rugs , with ' ' primitive ' ' designs that are timelessly classic and modern all at once . But for all their abundance , rock-bottom bargains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fe tend to be well heeled , and sellers generally ask what the market will bear. // If you can tear yourself away from the Plaza with its venerable low-lying buildings and swarms of eager tourists , you can actually do some serious museum-visiting in this , the nation ' s oldest city that serves as a state capital . Just off the Plaza is the Museum of Fine Arts , with its large permanent collection of the works of promi-nent Southwest artists . Along one side of the Plaza itself is the famous Palace of the Governors , built in 1609 and successively occupied by Spanish , Indian , Mexican , and American ( including Confederate ) governments . It now houses exhibits tracing the colorful and turbulent history of the state . And along its Plaza side , of course , is the ubiquitous line of Indians displaying their jewelry in the shade of its portal , or porch. // There is something about this sight that is so colorful , exotic , and dramatic that it has come to personify the charm of Santa Fe . The Plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows under the portal will be a river of silver jewelry spread on cloths upon the ground , studded with flashes of turquoise . And sitting with their backs to the palace wall will be the Indians , their faces serious and proud , yet gentle , too , their jet-black hair gleaming like their silver handiwork . The Indians selling there monitor the authenticity of their wares , and every item must either have been made by the seller or a member of his immediate family . The photographing of these Indians at the Palace of the Governors is strictly prohibited. // To find the primitive , untouched aspect of Santa Fe , simply take any road in the center of town and drive for about 10 minutes in any direction . The endless Southwestern landscape will stretch out all around you . Where the town ends , the wilderness begins . To the north will be the towering Sangre de Cristo mountains , really the tail end of the Rockies . It is said they were named ' ' Blood of Christ ' ' because of the blood-red glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your left , beyond a wide plain , are more mountains , but very different from the Sangre de Cristos . They are extinct volcanoes , and with their gradual conelike shape , they look it . Geologically they are a much older group than the higher Sangre de Cristos. // The ground around you outside of Santa Fe will be pale pink , studded with rotund pinon and juniper bushes about four feet high . At any distance , these bushes take on the look of dark green polka dots against the pink background of the hills . And always , except in the early morning when the sky is nothing but a blaze of blue , you will be accompanied by the giant , bulbous , gleaming white cloud formations of the Southwest. // With such powerful scenic surroundings , it is only natural that Santa Fe should have long attracted artists . They have come here and stayed , enchanted by the mystery and poetry of the place. // Fine art galleries abound here , but I found that one in particular gave me a wonderful introduction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 128 West Palace , just off the Plaza . The owners and staff are so friendly , the many chairs and seats so inviting , the large and small exhibition spaces so peaceful , intimate , and conducive to uninterrupted gazing , and the quality of art so outstanding , that one can spend hours there and come away inspired and refreshed. // When I visited , the large landscapes of Laurence Sisson were among the most impressive paintings , though perhaps my favorites were the impressionistic pastels of Albert Handell , the luminous watercolors of James Kramer , or the romantic and delicate still lifes of Caroline Norton. // It is telling to note , by the way , that Laurence Sisson and Caroline Norton are originally from New England , Albert Handell is from New York , and James Kramer from Ohio . But the pull of the Southwest has been such a powerful influence on them that here they remain. // What else is there for the tourist to do in Santa Fe ? You can take a highly informative walking tour of 21/2 hours , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town . Or you can hop the ' ' Roadrunner ' ' open bus for a shorter but still instructive tour . In the evening you can attend the world-famous Santa Fe Opera a few miles north of the city ; the Santa Fe Festival Theatre , which presents three productions ( one a world premiere ) every summer ; the Desert Chorale ; or the Santa Fe Chamber Orchestra , to name but a few. // Christmas is a particularly lovely time in Santa Fe . Snow is usually plentiful on the surrounding mountains , and the skiing is reported to be excellent . In town , farolitos - lighted candles standing in sand at the bottom of paper bags - are everywhere , giving out a soft yellow glow . A musical procession known as Las Posadas begins every evening at 7 : 30 during mid-December . Santa Fe ' s restaurants , always festive and always serving superb New Mexican food , are especially inviting . In winter there are fewer tourists , and the town can seem to belong to you , to reveal some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its special charm. // In fact , lingering is so easy to do in Santa Fe , one wonders how many residents originally came as visitors , and never managed to tear themselves away. // // - 30// //
