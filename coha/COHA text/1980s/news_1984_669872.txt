BONN  --  In the last few months , redistributionist proposals threatened to stop a growth-oriented tax cut for West Germans . But on June 20 , a group of financial experts of the ruling parties met in Bonn under the chairmanship of Chancellor Helmut Kohl to announce a 20. 2 billion deutsche mark ( $7. 18 billion ) tax package , thus ending the long West German quarrel about tax reform . According to Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg , it represented " by far the biggest tax reduction in the history of West Germany . " ( The June 28 resignation of Economics Minister Otto Lambsdorff is not expected to affect the tax program . ) Under the new program , a married couple with two children and a taxable income of DM34 , 000 ( $12 , 100 ) would receive a cut of between $249 and $267 in 1986 and a much smaller one later . A single person with the same taxable income would receive $53 in 1986 , and $124 in 1988 . In most ways the government ' s package is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply-side emphasis on growth . The primary difference between the two is that the West German tax cut includes provisions for families , raising the gross deduction per child from $154 to $853 . This family allowance takes place in 1986 , the first year of the cut , which means families will benefit most from the first stage . In October 1982 the ruling coalition of Christian Democrats , Christian Socialists and Liberals took power with promises of a growth-oriented economy . Mr. Stoltenberg ' s proposal thus involved a softening of the tax progression , after an initial flat rate of 22% . The cost of this improvement is $7. 1 billion ; $1. 8 billion was set aside for family benefits . Though Mr. Stoltenberg originally asked for an offsetting tax rise  --  for example , an increase in value added tax ( VAT ) and alcohol and tobacco duties  --  the recent decision specifically excluded such increases . As yet there is no word on how the cut will be financed . The reduction did not come without heavy internal debate . Back in March , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income-tax system . In line with Chancellor Kohl ' s policy , the priority was on the reduction of the tax burden of middle-income people , with some extra relief for families . Due to inflation , more and more middle-income workers had entered higher and higher tax brackets . The top rate of 56% , which will remain the same , is reached for a single person with a taxable income of $46 , 200 a year ; for a couple it is $92 , 400 . The new tax cut ' s importance lies in the boost it will give to both consumer confidence and the business recovery . Anything less than $7. 1 billion wouldn ' t have worked : Too gradual a reduction would yield nothing in terms of growth . That the decision last month was aimed in this direction is welcome news . The tax proposal kicked off an immediate debate , both inside and outside Parliament . Three main points were made . First , the impressive reduction of the budget deficit had caused some deep cuts in the standard of living . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seemed to be some room for fiscal maneuvering for the first time since the change in government a year and a half ago . After more than two months of discussion the debate became confused . The original aims of Mr. Stoltenberg ' s idea had almost vanished , the warnings regarding financing largely forgotten . Understandably , but unfortunately , most of the debate was on which group should benefit from the tax break : In the language in vogue , this was who " deserved " the relief . The answer , of course , is that , given the low increases in wages , high taxes and social security costs , almost everyone deserves it . Most politicians would like the proposals to become effective soon , say , 1986 . Those like Mr. Stoltenberg argued that , given the tight budget , the tax break should have been reduced to between $3. 55 billion and $4. 98 billion . Others suggested that the family benefits should be adjusted later on . As for financing , many felt that the substantial reduction in budget deficits achieved since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic upswing will automatically lead to higher tax receipts ; if necessary , public borrowing could be increased easily . This idea was threatened by those who focused on redistribution . Given the present state of the German economy , there should be little doubt about priorities : The emphasis ought to be on a growing economy . Thanks to the new spirit in economic and financial policy , the economy as a whole and the government budget in particular are in much better shape than expected . Economic growth has picked up . It is expected to reach between 2. 5% and 3% in real terms during 1984 from 1. 3% in 1983 and a 1. 1% contraction in 1982 . Net government borrowing is likely to drop to $8. 9 billion this year from $11. 4 billion in 1983 . Yet uncertainties still exist . Puzzling forecasts about a cooling down of economic tempo in the U.S. damped expectations of the German business community for 1985 and beyond , and uncertainties about the effects of the strikes in the machine-building industry have to be taken seriously . Expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt crisis . This would hit the German economy , which exports almost a third of its production , especially hard . Interest rates are expected to rise further in the U.S. With no restrictions on current payments or on capital movements , the Bundesbank could be forced to increase even further the level of interest , now comparatively low . The interest gap between the U.S. and West Germany has reached 5. 5% . This unprecedented gap would have to be narrowed soon as the strength of the deutsche mark and the belief that the American dollar is currently overvalued are doubted . Last but not least , there is a pressing need to fight unemployment , which stands at about 2. 1 million ( 8. 6% of the labor force ) and imposes growing social pressure . In this environment the economy needs to be carefully tended . Everything should be done to stimulate growth . If the still fragile recovery came to a halt , much stronger incentives would be necessary to accelerate the pace again . The only instrument for the foreseeable future is fiscal policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cut accompanied by budgetary discipline could be . The financing is less important . To raise the already high VAT by one percentage point would , however , damp growth and further strengthen the trend toward the underground economy . Somewhat higher public borrowing would create no danger at all for the financial markets . Politically speaking , however , Mr. Stoltenberg deserves full support for his hesitation to deviate from his course of consolidation , the trademark of his successful financial policy . Any relaxation would send a totally wrong signal.  --  - Mr. von Wartenberg is a Christian Democratic member of the West German Bundestag and co-chairman of his party ' s finance committee.
