@#  | T he continents are drifting . Detroit , the heartland of North America 's auto industry , is inching ever closer to Italy , France , Japan , and Korea . And unlike the past , when international influences were felt most in the biggest and smallest cars , the changes for 1987 will also affect the bread-andbutter cars that are the economic soul of the domestic industry . New domestic sedans are becoming sportier . Flush headlights and aerodynamic styling abound . Cars sold by the Big Four ca n't help but reflect the increased competition ? and cooperation ? of the auto industry worldwide . Within two years , cars carrying domestic nameplates will be built in France , Germany , Italy , Korea , Canada , and Mexico . Even cars built here will have a more international flavor . Consider American Motors Corp. , which practically invented the American-made small car . For 1987 , AMC reenters the compact market by importing the new Renault R21 from Europe . The version sold here will likely have a two-liter four-cylinder engine mounted lengthwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot four-wheel-drive version of the R21 is in the works . For 1988 , a Canadian-built intermediate-size Renault will go on sale . Unlike the R21 , which will be much the same on both sides of the Atlantic , the larger car will be tailored specifically for the tastes of North American buyers . At General Motors Corp. , another full-size car switches to front-wheel drive with the introduction of the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville . The Bonneville will be similar to the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile 88 introduced in 1986 , and the three will share drive trains and suspension systems . For 1987 , Chevrolet will add a pair of sporty compacts to its line . The Beretta name goes on the two-door coupe , while the sedan will be called Corsica . Chassis are similar to those of the N-body ( Somerset , Grand Am , etc. ) sold by Buick , Pontiac , and Olds . A two-liter four will be standard , and a 2.8-liter V8 optional . The Beretta and Corsica fill the gap left by the demise of the Citation . Ford 's Thunderbird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later by an all-new front-drive model that will be be based on the Taurus/Sable chassis . Ford 's Mustang also will receive a face lift for 1987 , and the turbocharged SVO model will be dropped .

It will be built @# on a 99-inch wheelbase and have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder , available with or without turbo . Chrysler 's J-car , a new sporty intermediate , will seek to revive the spirit of the old Cordoba . Reports say that the car will be called the LeBaron GTC .

Also due is a Mitsubishibuilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide something for every buyer , Detroit will also import new cars in both the subcompact and superluxury classes . Even more so than the bread-and-butter cars , these immigrants form the automotive equivalent of the melting pot . Ford 's new Festiva subcompact will be imported from Korea in 1987 , just as Pontiac starts importing the LeMans , an Opel Kadett that also will be built in Korea . Chevy , meanwhi will add zip to its Sprint by tur charging its tiny three-cylinder e gine . The Sprint is made in Japan Suzuki . To meet the anticipated onslaught of Japanese and Korean econocar .. Volkswagen , once king of the European imports , is considering selling subcompact from Brazil . The car lA i. be based on the Glacel , which is cur rently on sale in South America . The Glacel looks similar to the Jetta , but is actually smaller than the Golf . Next year , Ford 's new Mexican plant is expected to begin supplying LincolnMercury with a new subcompact , codenamed Tracer . This car will replace the Lynx in the 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through its Merkur franchise . The German-built Scorpi which was named Europe 's car of tn. - year , will land in the U.S. in Januar. 1987 . Scorpio will be powered by 2.9-liter V6 , and anti-lock brakes wi be standard . The question is , How we . will it sell in a showroom next to th. less expensive Sable ? Luxury two-seaters The priciest new entries for 1987 will be the Cadillac Allante anc Chrysler-Maserati . The Allan-Le is d two-passenger version of the Curren : E-car ( Eldorado ) , with a body built in Italy and air-freighted to Detroit for final assembly . The 4.1-liter Cadillac V8 will provide the power . Price ? More than $40,000 . Chrysler 's two-seater will also be built in Italy . Some floor-pan stampings and power-train parts will be shipped over ; the boat will return with complete cars . There is still uncertainty about which version of the 2.2-liter four will be used , but at this writing , word is that the car will have a Maserati-built four-valve head and a turbocharger . Chrysler hopes to undercut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the family-car business , 1988 will bring the new GM-10 intermediates . scheduled to replace the A-car ( Celebrity , 6000 ) and G-special ( Monte Carlo . Cutlass Supreme , Regal ) . The program will create a basic car for five GM divisions , and is said to be the biggest model change in GM history . Finally , Ford will introduce a 1988 Continental based on the Taurus chassis . Look for it to be the first of a line of aerodynamic luxury cars that will use the company 's new front-wheeldrive chassis and three-liter V6 .
