The next shuttle orbiter that astronauts clamber into on the Kennedy Space Center launching pad will probably include a crude but effective escape system for them to use in case disaster strikes again. // Its landing brakes will be improved . Its main liquid fuel engines will be upgraded , and for the first time astronauts may fly without harboring the seldom-spoken fear that a malfunction in a simple 17-inch valve could choke off the craft ' s liquid fuel supply and send it crashing into the sea . <> <> Much Safer Craft Is Seen // The safety changes being made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration thus go far beyond the redesigning of the solid-fuel booster rocket whose failure killed seven astronauts 73 seconds into the flight of the Challenger last Jan. 28 . While the debate over how to redesign those boosters has drawn much attention , both agency officials and outside experts are concerned that other critical elements of the shuttle may have been neglected amid the pressures to keep flying that contributed to the Challenger ' s destruction. // Most experts agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it will be far from fully repaired . Long-term overhauls are scheduled for about half a dozen major subsystems , and most will not be complete until the mid-1990 ' s . Thus , the craft that is scheduled to fly in about a year will be a shuttle of transition , a 1970 ' s model that engineers are patching up for 1988 but know they need to virtually redesign for 2000 . <> <> Role of the Shuttle // " The hard truth , " said Arnold D. Aldrich , the NASA engineer overseeing the multibillion-dollar effort , " is that the really major changes take years. " // How those changes proceed may also be linked inextricably to both the politics and the future role of the shuttle . Even after the trauma of the accident , the shuttle is widely regarded as scientifically valuable and essential to the more ambitious military projects of the next two decades . But there is rising debate on how much the nation should rely on a shuttle system made safe for man to fly - at extraordinary cost and complexity. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also include unmanned rockets to lift commercial and military payloads ? How much should be invested in an aging shuttle technology ? When should the agency turn its attentions to a new generation of shuttles ? // Most experts agree the shuttle should no longer serve as a regular freight and passenger train to space , the role NASA once considered central in selling the shuttle program to Congress and the public. // " Is the shuttle ever going to be an ' operational ' system again , or is it always going to be a test vehicle ? " asked Eugene E. Covert , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who was a key member of the Presidential commission that investigated the accident . " It must always be regarded as experimental , its use limited to professional astronauts. " // The redesign effort has itself raised some new worries , chiefly from engineers concerned that a whole new class of hazards may be introduced as others are eliminated . The new escape system , for example , puts explosives in the crew cabin for the first time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off only on command . <> <> Some of the Findings Thus Far // Interviews with agency officials and outside experts over the last month about the effort to get the shuttle flying have also revealed these points : // * The escape mechanism , which can be used only after the booster rockets have burned out two minutes into flight , will enable astronauts , each harnessed to a miniature rocket , to blast out of the cabin and then parachute to earth. // * The complexity of tasks ahead , particularly testing , casts severe doubt that flights will resume by February 1988 as planned , some agency officials say. // * Construction of an orbiter to replace the lost Challenger will not begin until next August , and some NASA officials say the builder , Rockwell International , is watching helplessly as many key engineers leave the project for more immediate tasks , often with other companies . Rockwell executives declined requests for interviews. // * For reasons of safety , NASA has quietly scrapped plans to use the shuttle ' s main engines at 109 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * After saying for weeks that they had " reproduced the failure " of the Challenger ' s booster rockets in ground tests , NASA engineers now concede that they recreated only the first second of the malfunction . The full 73-second sequence may never be recreated and fully understood , they said. // No matter how exhaustive the shuttle ' s revamping , outside experts and even some NASA officials agree that another accident may well occur in the next decade . The only real question , one senior space agency official conceded recently , is whether the next accident will truly be an accident , unavoidable and unforeseeable. // " If instead it looks like another Challenger , " he warned , referring to the cascade of miscommunications and mismanagement , ignored warnings and startingly bad judgment that the Presidential commission said led to the disaster , " the shuttle could well go the way of the dirigible . Another Challenger could mean the end of American manned space flight . " Now , a Plan For Escape From the earliest days of the shuttle program , NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be far safer staying inside the spacecraft than bailing out . So the crew has been extensively trained in how to make an emergency landing at runways at Kennedy Space Center and around the world . And if all else failed , But the image of seven trapped astronauts trapped aboard the Challenger radically changed that thinking . Some individual emergency air supplies for the crew had been turned on , strongly suggesting that a few crew members were alive for at least part of a terrifying plunge into the Atlantic . And the flattened and fractured condition of the reIndeed , " NASA has now concluded that ditching the shuttle in the ocean is not survivable , " said William A. Chandler , who holds the new position of manager of crew escape systems at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. // In ditching , " we are talking about coming into the water at 200 knots , " he said . " The Navy has never had any survivors ditching at that speed . " <> <> ' We Needed an Alternative ' // " We realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative. " // But designing an escape system that has a reasonable chance of saving the crew in a variety of emergencies has proved no easy task . And the system NASA is now working on has one major shortfall , as did virtually all other designs considered : It is useless in the first two minutes of powered flight , when all engines are burning and disaster is thus most likely to strike. // Early hopes that it would be possible to build an egg-like " escape pod " that could be ejected at almost any time have been dashed , at least in the short term . " It would require enormous restructuring of the shuttle , " said Mr. Aldrich . " Just installing the pods would probably take each orbiter out of service for a year , maybe more. " // Ejection seats were also rejected as unmanageable ; some astronauts are usually on the mid-deck level , too far inside the craft for ejection . And an astronaut who simply bailed out with a parachute would probably hit the shuttle ' s giant wing. // So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for either the first or second post-Challenger shuttle mission , is a version of a system used in some fighter planes and experimental aircraft : a $50 million " tractor rocket " system that would pull an astronaut from the craft at high speed , then automatically deploy a parachute. // When an emergency arises , and assuming " that you could stabilize the craft , " Mr. Chandler said , a " jumpmaster " - an astronaut charged with directing the evacuation - would blow out the entry hatch , to be equipped with explosive bolts . Then he would fold down a ladder to serve as a launching sled , and the astronauts would lie on it , The jumpmaster would take a rocket from a magazine and tether it to the harness each survival-clad astronaut will be wearing , along with emergency oxygen , a life raft and a radio beacon . The rocket would pull the astronaut through the hatch and beyond the orbiter ' s wing . After the rocket drops away , a parachute would open auto " Rockwell has run some simulations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door in 112 seconds , " said Mr. Chandler . Outside experts said they doubted it would be possible to escape that quickly in the chaos surrounding an emergency. // The system appears to meet the Presidential commission ' s call for an escape mechanism usable " during controlled gliding flight . " But Mr. Chandler concedes , " It assumes that you survive the initial trouble , " adding that it would probably not help crew members if the orbiter was spinning into the sea - as the Challenger did - because Perhaps more important , NASA officials say they will not have time to test the system as a whole , although they are testing individual components , before putting it aboard the shuttle when flights resume . And the escape system still requires the formal approval of Adm . Richard H. Truly , the associate administrator of space flight. // Meanwhile , more sophisticated escape systems are being studied for the mid-1990 ' s . Main Engines : Power vs . Risk By almost any engineering standard , the shuttle ' s three liquid-fuel engines are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the craft . Designed to be compact and lightweight , they operate at a higher chamber pressure than any engine on earth - twice as much pressure as the giant engines used in the Saturn V rockets that took man to the moon . And along with the high performance , experts agree , goes high risk : For hours after the shuttle accident , dozens of NASA engineers believed it was the far more complex main engines , not the seemingly well-understood solid-fuel booster rockets , that would ultimately be held culpable. // As it turned out , the engines worked perfectly . But the accident inquiry renewed and widened a long-simmering debate : Are troubles with the main engines a question of durability and economics , as NASA insists , or another another accident waiting to happen ? // Without question , the engines have fallen far short of NASA ' s specifications for durability . The high-pressure turbopumps for hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen , probably the engine ' s most critical components , were designed to last 55 flights , or about seven and a half hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few minutes of flight . In fact , the turbopumps must be replaced after four or five flights , less than 10 percent of the goal . <> <> Problems in Ground Tests // Perhaps more importantly , a series of problems in ground tests - most notably cracked turbine blades , unexplained vibrations and several valve failures - have led many to question the engines ' safety . " The fear , " one member of the Presidential commission said recently , " is that NASA could do the same thing again that they did with the booster - never discover what the real margins are. " // Mr. Aldrich agrees . " If there is a lesson from the tragedy that we have to use throughout the shuttle system , " he said , " it ' s that we always have to listen to what the hardware is telling us. " // But deciphering those messages is never an easy task in such a complex system . In about 60 hours of ground testing through last year , there were roughly 16 serious failures . A recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Five of those failures would probably have been catastrophic if they had occurred in flight. " // Already eight of 13 major problems encountered with the engines in recent tests appear to have been solved . But continuing turbine blade cracks , along with more subtle problems , have led to a two-stage NASA plan to solve the problems . Rocketdyne , the Rockwell subsidiary that makes the engines , is vastly stepping up testing and making what Bob Paster , the company ' s manager of the project , calls " minor modifications " in an essentially good design . The shape of the turbine blades has been changed , for instance , and they have been insulated against thermal shock . <> <> An Alternative Turbopump // Meanwhile , the Pratt &; Whitney division of United Technologies was awarded a $198 million contract this month to start from scratch in redesigning the engine ' s turbopumps . " You simply can ' t make wholesale changes in an operational program , " insists Joe Lombardo , in charge of the main engine project at NASA ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine will give us an alternative . " But the alternative will probably not be ready until 1991 , when the shuttle is expected to again be flying more than a dozen missions a year. // Meanwhile , NASA is taking no chances . During most shuttle flights , the engines are run at 104 percent of their rated power of 470 , 000 pounds of thrust . There had been plans to go up to 109 percent of thrust , starting with missions last summer that were canceled after the accident , for boosting some particularly heavy payloads into space. // But " before we run at 109 percent , " Mr. Lombardo said , " the thought was that we should run the engine even harder to assure that we had some margin . " Still unresolved is whether NASA should test one engine to its limits - destruction - at a cost of $45 million . Some say that is the only way to learn the engine ' s true limits ; others , including NASA , say it is a waste of money because it only shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surprises If hints of accidents-to-come can be found in the shuttle , agency officials say , they are probably buried in the " Critical Items List , " the compendium of parts whose failure could result in the loss of a mission or - in the case of nearly a thousand " Crit 1 " parts - the loss of the vehicle and its crew. // NASA ' s first review of those potential failures raised 262 problems , some involving proposed hardware changes , some new software and some simply calling for more tests and analysis. // But most of those are now resolved , agency officials say , and subsequent reviews still under way at each of NASA ' s flight centers have yielded a surprisingly low number of surprises . " We don ' t see any show-stoppers , " said Mr. Aldrich . " That ' s why I think we can hit the February 1988 launch date , " though he said it would be " very tight. " // On Capitol Hill and among oversight groups , however , there is concern over whether NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorize some systems as " redundant " - meaning there is a backup system - when there is little assurance that the backup would work . " It ' s easy to forget , " said one member of a National Research Council group reviewing the list , " the O rings were redundant , too. " // But Mr. Aldrich and other engineers are equally concerned that NASA may make too many changes , not too few . " We are by no means changing everything on the shuttle , " Mr. Aldrich said . " Making a change always implies some risk that it may not be better . " <> <> Tank Valve to Be Changed // First among the modifications will be a redesign of a part that has never failed in flight : the disconnect valves on the external fuel tank that have long been a source of worry among shuttle experts . The valves sit in the center of the 17-inch ducts that feed liquid hydrogen and oxygen from the tank to the shuttle ' s main engines . And they close milliseconds before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the valve could close unexpectedly during flight , " said Thomas Redmond , who is involved in the Johnson Space Center ' s review of the critical items list . " That has never happened , but if it did it would be catastrophic , " because the three engines would suddenly be starved of all fuel. // Before the first flight , NASA engineers will probably put a device on the valves to prevent accidental closing . But the seemingly small change is expected to cost millions of dollars . Another long-term solution is under study . Juggling The Money " For the first time in my engineering career , " John W. Thomas , the head of NASA ' s effort to redesign the shuttle ' s flawed solid rocket boosters , " money is not a problem. " // In fact , throughout the agency engineers and administrators , often to their own surprise , said they had plenty of funds - but often not plenty of engineering talent - to get the shuttle back into orbit . Just a few months ago , plentiful funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of a replacement orbiter , it never said how it would pay for it . Many feared that NASA once again would be forced to juggle the need to build a new shuttle and with the need to fix its old one. // In the last days of the Congressional session , however , the agency ' s budget was increased more than 30 percent , to $10. 43 billion . That included $2. 1 billion , transferred over the Pentagon ' s objection from its budget , for the new orbiter . But because of efforts to cut the Federal budget deficit , the money can not be spent until next summer , putting Rockwell a full year behind its original schedule and delaying delivery of the Challenger ' s replacement until April 1991. // It also raises questions about what kind of engineering talent will build the craft . The B-1 bomber program , for which Rockwell is the contractor , is tapering off , and Rockwell engineers suspect this orbiter is the company ' s last . " People are bailing out every week , going elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA , Mr. Aldrich said : " There is an issue about retaining Rockwell ' s engineering and production team . We still don ' t know how big an impact that will have . " <> <> Long-Term Prospects Unclear // NASA plans to spend $440 million in preparing for the resumption of flights this year , about the same amount that was saved with the cancellation of more than a dozen flights this year . Along the way , the agency says it is spending $10 million to add about 120 quality assurance engineers to the Johnson and Marshall centers , $125 million to fix any surprise problems that emerge in the review of " critical items " and millions more to replenish the supply of spare parts , which has been badly depleted. // Long-term financing for the shuttle program is more doubtful . President Reagan has ordered that NASA abandon commercial payloads and many military payloads are being shifted to unmanned rockets , moves that will cost the agency more than $800 million in 1987 and cut more deeply into its revenues after that. // " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one senior NASA official said recently , recalling how the program was sold to Congress . " No more . Now it ' s a budget item like everything else . " The Fears Of Landing When the designers of the space shuttle first assembled the craft ' s landing gear and brakes , they never envisioned the approach speeds or landing weights that have become routine for shuttle flight . Nor did they know that the astronaut corps would be so afraid of a failure in the steering system , keyed to the shuttle ' s forward wheel , that they would refuse to use it at all . Instead , they have steered the shuttle at landing by applying different levels of pressure on the brakes. // As a result , a House investigating committee concluded this fall , " Orbiter landings appear high-risk even under ideal conditions , which seldom occur . " The Presidential commission on the Challenger accident agreed , complaining that the landing systems " do not have sufficient safety margin , particularly at abort landing sites , " places where the shuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , no one at NASA is able to quantify how big those margins are , or even if they exist . The problems have been twofold : Unexpected virbrations have caused chipping on the carbon pads of the disc brakes , and the tremendous heat generated in applying the brakes at landing has caused cracks in the beryllium components that press against each other inside the landing gear assembly . The beryllium is being replaced with heavier carbon brakes , but even those have not been free of troubles on some commercial airplanes. // " I wouldn ' t call the brakes a great danger , " says Wayne Miller , the director of the orbiter project and logistics at NASA headquarters in Washington . " We ' ve always felt we could stop the vehicle. " // But astronauts say the question is when and where the vehicle stops . Investigators say some shuttle pilots have been instructed never to let up on the brakes once they have been applied , for fear of triggering a brake failure. // Some time after flights resume , Mr. Miller said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure occurs the shuttle will automatically point straight ahead , rather than spin to the side . That should make pilots less leery of using the steering system . In the meantime , he said , the shuttle would land only at Edwards Air Force Base in the California desert , " where there ' s lots of room to make an error . " Meanwhile , The Booster It was 7 o ' clock in the morning and the sun had not yet risen over the giant rocket test stands at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , but Gerald W. Smith had already been at his desk for some time . " At times it ' s exhausting , " said Mr. Smith , NASA ' s new head of the booster rocket office . " We spend all day going all the way down the structure of the rocket , trying to figure what could fail. " // Ever since NASA began redesigning the booster rockets , whose flaws - and those of the agency that built them - became the subject of endless analysis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of it centers on whether NASA is simply seeking a " quick fix " for expediency or the best solution. // " There is no question in my mind , " said Mr. Smith , his desk piled high with engineering reports and diagrams of the now-familiar joint that failed in one of the Challenger ' s boosters . " I am now pretty confident in the design. " // So are most outside experts , who say that if the redesigned joints between segments survives the testing regime , there is little chance it could fail again . A third O ring has been added to each joint to prevent the escape of hot gases ; a " capture feature " prevents the joint from bulging open as the rocket pressurizes ; putty that gave way between insulation segments has been eliminated . Another joint , where the rocket nozzle connects to the fuel case , which has been a source of major worry since before the disaster , has been similarly redesigned . <> <> Questions on Tests // Still , there are concerns . A National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new design - in a full-size rocket mirroring conditions at launching - are enough ; NASA insists the tests are sufficient . Competitors of Morton Thiokol Inc. , the rocket ' s builder , have expressed worries about new stresses on metal parts arising from the redesign , and say the rocket segments may be difficult to assemble. // NASA officials concede that if it was starting from scratch , it would probably adopt an entirely different design for joining rocket segments , in which the segments are bolted together through flanges , rather than interlocking as they are now . But that design could probably not be adapted to 72 steel rocket cases that were ordered before the accident . A flange design may be favored , however , when NASA soon chooses a contractor to supply a new generation of boosters for the 1990 ' s. // Meanwhile , Mr. Smith is directing the booster program in what he termed " a glass house " of intense scrutiny . He seems acutely aware that his predecessor , Lawrence J. Mulloy , was widely faulted for communications gaps and misjudgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism as 20-20 hindsight and doubts he would have acted any differently . In picking up the pieces , " all I can do is give it my best shot , " he says . " I can ' t work any harder - I can ' t try any harder. " //
