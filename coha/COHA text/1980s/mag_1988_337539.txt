As President Reagan was putting the last touches on his eighth budget proposal to Congress last week , a similar exercise was taking place three blocks north of the White House , in our Washington bureau . TIME correspondents , playing the roles of the Cabinet officers they are normally assigned to cover , decided to try their hands at chopping the $150 billion federal deficit . The result , which appears in this week 's Economy &; Business section , may not revolutionize the budget process , but it is likely to encourage more than a few taxpayers to pick up a pencil and try it themselves . <P> National Economics Correspondent Richard Hornik conceived the project as a way of illustrating why Congress and the President have not gone far enough to solve the deficit crisis . Hornik grew increasingly alarmed by the problem upon returning to the U.S. ten months ago after two years as bureau chief in Beijing , where budget decisions are not hindered by public opinion . " As a nation , we have been living beyond our means , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ensured unless the budget deficit is reduced . " <P> Hornik and his colleagues interviewed experts , assessed the worthiness of costly weapons systems , debated tax increases and piled up enormous personal deficits on late-night coffee and takeout cheeseburgers . Like the policymakers in the White House and on Capitol Hill , they quickly learned that there is no free lunch , takeout or otherwise . National Security Correspondent Bruce van Voorst selflessly suggested deep cuts in spending at the Pentagon , but Correspondents Ricardo Chavira , Glenn Garelik and Dick Thompson and Reporter Jerome Cramer had a tougher time slicing the nondefense areas they cover . " We had hoped to crunch numbers dispassionately , " recalls Correspondent Ted Gup , who covers Congress . " But the numbers are merely symbols expressing values . Passions are aroused when values come into conflict . If a roomful of journalists found it so difficult to agree , you can imagine how hard it is for lawmakers . " <P> Senior Editor Charles Alexander , who supervised the project with the help of Associate Editor Stephen Koepp , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that will work . " We wanted to stimulate discussion , " he says . Of course , he adds with a wry smile , " cutting the deficit was a little easier for us . We do n't have to run for re-election .
