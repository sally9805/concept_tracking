/ To the naked eye , the object mounted on a postage stamp-size wafer and held aloft by a pair of tweezers is all but invisible . Even under a bright light , it looks like nothing more than a speck of dust . But magnified 160 times in an electron microscope , the speck begins to take on shape and function : a tiny gear with teeth the size of blood cells . " You have to be careful when handling these things , " warns Kaigham Gabriel , an engineer at AT &T; Bell Laboratories . " I 've accidentally inhaled a few right into my lungs . " <P> The miniaturization of technology , having made extraordinary progress in the 40 years since the invention of the transistor , is about to make another shrinking leap . Adapting the chipmaking equipment used to squeeze millions of electrical circuits onto slivers of silicon , researchers are creating a lilliputian tool chest of tiny moving parts : valves , gears , springs , levers , lenses and ball bearings . One team at the University of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wider than an eyelash that can rotate 500 times a minute . <P> Welcome to the world of microtechnology , where machines the size of sand grains are harnessed to do useful work . Huge numbers of microscopic sensors are already employed to measure the temperature , air pressure and acceleration of airplanes and automobiles . Delco Electronics alone sells 7 million silicon pressure sensors a year to its parent company , General Motors , for use in power-train controls and diagnostics . But scientists at Berkeley , Stanford , M.I.T. , AT &T,; IBM and a handful of other research centers around the world see much broader possibilities for minuscule machines . They envision armies of gnat-size robots exploring space , performing surgery inside the human body or possibly building skyscrapers one atom at a time . " Microelectronics is on the verge of a second revolution , " says Jeffrey Lang , a professor of electromechanics at M.I.T. " We 're still dreaming of applications . " <P> A report to the U.S. National Science Foundation last year listed dozens of near-term uses for the new micromachines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz saws to assist doctors performing microsurgery . <P>  --  Micro-optical systems to focus lasers to the precision required for fiber- optic communication . <P>  --  Miniature machine parts that could drive a new generation of tiny tape recorders , camcorders and computers . <P> Engineers and industrialists are rushing to put the new technologies to use . M.I.T. has invested $20 million in a new fabrication facility for micromachining and microelectronics . Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry is considering allocating nearly $70 million for the development of medical microrobots . " I 'm absolutely amazed at how fast this field has progressed , " says George Hazelrigg , a program director at the NSF , the Government agency spearheading the U.S. 's micromechanics effort .
