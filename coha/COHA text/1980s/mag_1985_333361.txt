In a small courtroom in Orange County , Calif. , last week , Attorney Allen Millstone pointed sadly to his wheelchair-bound client . In 1983 James Higgins had been a vigorous young man of 18 when he went to Disneyland and took a ride on Space Mountain . As the roller coaster rounded a bend , the youth was suddenly thrown from the rocket car . Through Disney 's negligence , argued Millstone , Higgins is a paraplegic . Twenty-four hundred miles away in Florida , in another Orange County courtroom , an equally sad story was unfolding . While Marietta and Harry Goode listened closely , Lawyer Philip Freidin recounted a tragic 1977 family outing to Disney World during which the couple 's four-year-old son slipped away and drowned in the moat in front of Cinderella Castle . The amusement park , charged Freidin , had failed to guard the waterway properly . <P> Normally , sympathy-evoking cases like these are prized by personal-injury lawyers , who usually win a healthy majority of their suits  --  and collect a third of any winnings . But even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendant is Walt Disney Productions . Against the huge entertainment complex , personal-injury specialists are hardly ever victorious . The company 's astonishing success is the result of a combination of safety-minded care and case-hardened lawyering . <P> Disney refuses to disclose the annual number of injuries at the California and Florida parks , which draw more than 30 million visitors a year , but there is little doubt that thousands occur . The majority never result in suits at all , thanks to quick soothing from Disney . Says Mike McCray , Disneyland 's lawyer since 1955 : " If people get wet , we 've got clothes dryers , and we dry them off . Before they know it , they 're back out there having fun . " <P> Once a suit is filed , however , Disney takes a tough stance , rarely settling out of court for large sums . There are exceptions : the family of a 57-year-old man who drowned after skimming down a River Country slide at Disney World , although a lifeguard was on duty , got $250,000 . But generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a lot of money , they 're gon na have to fight for it . If we did n't take that attitude , we 'd maybe have as many as 100 times the lawsuits . " <P> Today , Disney says , fewer than 100 lawsuits are filed each year , and plaintiffs ' attorneys concede that all are uphill battles . In the Higgins case , Disney contends the youth had been drinking and caused the roller-coaster accident himself . In Orlando , the company argues that the moat in which the boy drowned was safeguarded by at least two fences . <P> The advantage , lawyers maintain , is Disney 's right from the time of the accident . Employees quickly summon supervisors and " security hosts " to round up witnesses and interview the injured , who are often their own worst enemies . Says Orlando Attorney John Overchuck : " It 's your dignity that really is on the line , and God knows what you 'll say at the time : ' I should have been looking where I was going . How stupid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down .
