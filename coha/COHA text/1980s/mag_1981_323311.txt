COCKTAIL MOLOTOV Directed and Written by Diane Kurys <P> VOYAGE EN DOUCE Directed and Written by Michel Deville <P> Around the time they discovered blue jeans , Europeans discovered another American invention , the open road , and gave the genre some local twists , such as the persistence of class conceits . Bertrand Blier ( Going Places ) and Wim Wenders ( Kings of the Road ) established the itinerary ; now Diane Kurys , whose Peppermint Soda took a fresh , funny look at growing up Jewish in Paris , follows that road . Cocktail Molotov is set in May 1968 , when French students and workers virtually shut down their country . Alas for Anne ( Elise Caron ) , that is the moment she chooses to defy her bourgeois mother and take off with her lower-class lover Frederic ( Philippe Lebas ) and his friend ( Franois Cluzet ) . The trio have a vague plan : they will ship out from Venice and find happiness on a kibbutz in Israel . <P> Reality , of course , intrudes , in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull of events taking place back in Paris . Most of the film is devoted not to the young people 's efforts at escape , but to their attempt to return and link up with what seems to them a generational rite of passage . That is original , and Director Kurys has a shrewd and sympathetic eye for adolescent foibles . In Caron the director has found a youngster who , though she has never acted before , has vulnerability and intelligence . Still the film seems inconsequential . Anne and her friends learn a few things and grow up a notch or two , the way people always do in stories of this kind . C'est la vie , c'est l'ennui . <P> Voyage en Douce insinuates itself much more memorably into one 's mind . In it , two women who may well have taken part in the events of 1968 attempt to come to grips with the issues of grownup existence . Lucie ( Geraldine Chaplin ) is slightly the older , and definitely the less stable . Helene ( Dominique Sanda ) discovers her on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving her husband because he has imaginary affairs and permits their dog to watch them making love . These may not be grounds for divorce , but they do indicate that a change of scene is in order . Since Hlne is off to look at vacation homes , she takes her friend on the expedition . <P> Through several days of house hunting they reminisce and fantasize about their love lives . These incidents include everything from casual encounters ( both successful and not ) to rapes . It is impossible to determine which ones are true , which are entirely fanciful and which are a little of both . Some are ironic , many are wistful . The exchange of confidences between two women who have known each other since school days leads to a deepening of their relationship that is very moving . As they become more open with each other emotionally , they become more open physically . This does not lead to a lesbian encounter , but it does give the film a distinct erotic charge . <P> It would , however , be wrong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tease . Voyage en Douce is about longing - for sexual connections that are some thing other than briefly poignant or lengthily quotidian . There is a real feeling of regret when the two women complete their voyage en douce and return to their separate lives . <P> - By Richard Schickel
