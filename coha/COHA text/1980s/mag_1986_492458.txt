Not to be outdone by cereal manufacturers , the American Institute of Baking has found in a study : " The calcium in bread ( both white and whole-wheat ) appeared readily available and has a biological value only slightly less than calcium in milk .

The Post was recently invited to at  --  tend a symposium of leading authori  --  ties on the subject of osteoporosis and how to avoid it . A moderator for the meeting in Hawaii was Dr. William Peck , professor of medicine at the Washington University School of medicine and physician-in-chief of the Jewish Hospital of Saint Louis . Dr. Peck observed : " There is a large amount of evidence to indicate that osteoporosis is in many in  --  dividuals a preventable disease , and that 's good news and bad news . The good news is that it is preventable . The bad news is that a lot of people  --  and I mean physicians as well as the lay public  --  do n't know how to go about preventing it . " The female panelists expressed par  --  ticular concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen-age female population as the group at highest risk for developing osteoporosis in the future . Unfortu  --  nately , the " fly now , and pay later " philosophy translates into " fly now , and perhaps pay later " for many young people . Much concern was voiced regarding the sedentary , TV-watching customs of youth , who fail to get the exercise that would help them deposit bone during their tee  --  age years , when 90 percent of bone calcium is acquired . Milk drinking is not an " in " thing among the youth culture , and caffeinated beverages not only contain no calcium but in  --  crease the excretion of calcium that might be available from other sources . The doctors pointed out that dieters avoiding milk should use other dairy products such as yogurt , cot tage cheese , and 2 percent milk , all high in calcium and not high in calories . Dr. Charles Chesnut , professor of medicine and radiology and di  --  rector of the Osteoporosis Re  --  search Center at the University of Washington , concurred : " Lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For exam  --  ple , just take the macrobiotic diet , and the number of people who are on it . If you are a strict vegetarian , you can be without milk products and be seriously deficient in calcium . I recall the professional basketball player Bill Walton , whose fractures did n't heal because of his diet . Even though he saw a large num  --  ber of physicians , nobody took a nutritional history on him be  --  cause he looked so healthy . " I do have a very real concern about the teen-age pregnancy that we see so commonly in this country today . Here is a young woman who has not yet completed her bone mass and is still in her most formative years , adding pregnancy with an additional level of need for the baby . What does this do to her ? I do n't think we have enough informa  --  tion yet . But in the diets of these young women , as for all women in pregnancy , it is very important to in  --  crease their calcium intake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone mass , Dr. Everett L. Smith , director of the Biogerontology Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin Department of Preventive Medicine , reported : " There have been some animal studies in which monkeys were im  --  mobilized for as long as six months , and these monkeys were found to lose anywhere from 25 to 30 percent of their bone mass . It took them as many as 40 months to get that bone back . So , the research seems to in  --  dicate that you can lose bone mass , and it can be regained . " Dr. Donaldson did a study of put  --  ting three young men at bed rest for a period of time . They were volunteers . They could volunteer to go to Korea or to go to bed for a while . They chose to go to bed for a period of 36 weeks . In the process of being in bed , they lost approximately one percent of their bone mass per week from their heel bones . At the end of the time , they were reambulated , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space flights , the Skylab situa  --  tions , and such . With loss of weight-bearing activities , you see a loss in bone mass . " Regular physical activity pre vents fractures . Those individuals that fall , especially in the older years , have a significant decline in flexibility and muscular strength . We have found with our research that we can increase muscular strength and flexibility with exercise . We did research on a population of 71-year-old wom en . We showed as much as a 21 percent general increase in flex ibility of the body functions , and one of these areas that we found was the ankle . We saw a 48 per cent increase in flexibility at the ankle . Now , when you translate that into prevention of falls , you will see that increased flexibility will help tremendously in some of the fall reductions . At the same time , we looked at muscular strength . The muscles that usually go first are the quadriceps muscles in the legs . In continued on page 110 irhe clicking of the roulette wheel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth rif  --  fle of blackjack decks as I went down into the pit . Behind me came the crank-whir-clunk of slot machines , where customers with a lost look in their eyes methodically fed their metallic tormentors and listened absently for the occasional rattle of returning coins . The casino 's vast , well-lit pit area had no windows through which dawn 's early light might whisper its shocking reality . The dice players might have been at these tables for hours . It was five minutes to eight on Sun  --  day morning , and I was on my way to a worship service in the ballroom of Las Vegas ' biggest and glitziest hotel . As I approached the ballroom , the sounds of gambling were replaced by the familiar strains of " How Great Thou Art . " Some 400 persons were already there , and as I took a seat in the back and joined in the singing , I tried to get a fix on the personality of this congregation . Some , in coats and ties , were Easterners , like me ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply dressed  --  middle-class folks from all back  --  grounds and walks of life . All had a fresh-scrubbed look about them , and they were unquestionably glad to be there . Attendance was optional at this service , the first entry on the agenda of the A.L . Williams Company 's na  --  tional convention , and I smiled to re  --  call how I happened to be there . I had never heard of A.L . Williams when the Post called and asked me if I would do an update on him . In 1977 , Williams had founded an insurance company based on the then-radical philosophy of " buy term and invest the difference . " It was apparently an idea whose time had come , for in  --  credibly , in the year ending Decem  --  ber 1985 , the company had written insurance with a face value of more than $65 billion ! Surely , this was a great American success story of the ' 80s , with new chapters being writ  --  ten almost daily . I was interested . Several years before , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying life insurance annually , like car insurance ) , instead of the whole life I was carrying . I did , and I discovered that my whole-life policies were accruing cash value at an annual rate of 3.2 per  --  cent . That may have been reason  --  able back when I had first taken the policies out , but in the interim interest rates had soared . Certifi  --  cates of deposit and government treasury bills , to say nothing of mutual funds , had begun yielding more than three times that amount . There were as yet , however , no such things as IRAs  --  the retire  --  ment accounts that defer taxes on those high-interest yields . So today , the idea of buying term , as long as one invests the difference between the cost of term and of whole life , makes even more sense to me , especially for young families with heavy financial responsibilities and little equity . So there I was in Las Vegas , at  --  tending a Sunday-morning service that kicked off a four-day A.L . Williams Company conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RVPs had brought their wives or husbands , for the com  --  pany emphasizes family life . Why Las Vegas , then ? Because there are n't many locations in the country with the capacity to handle so large a gathering . And because its RVPs pay their own way , the company alter  --  nates conference sites between the East and the Far West . Another plus : Provided one stays out of the casino area , food and lodging are surprising  --  ly inexpensive . The main event of the day was an all-hands-on-deck rally that evening . The mountains to the west were sil  --  houetted against a fiery red sky with dark swirls of clouds as I walked to the auditorium . I arrived just as play the next day  --  no matter who we faced , we 'd win . What we did have the next morning was another general meeting in the auditorium , this one strictly business . As I waited for it to begin , I reviewed what I had learned about the man who would be running it . A former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance in 1967 to supplement his coach 's salary . Insurance had special meaning for him : His fa  --  ther , like Art a successful high-school football coach , had died suddenly of a heart attack while Art was still in college . Art 's fa  --  ther had faithfully paid through  --  out his life into policies that he had presumed would take care of his family  --  but that in reality proved far from adequate . Art struggled to help his moth er support their family ; later , as he called on friends and the par ents of the boys he coached , he was determined to sell them enough coverage to prevent the same thing from happening to them . His solution : term insurance , combined with a solid investment program . In 1971 , he moved his family to Atlanta and began selling insurance full-time , and six years later , with 85 people , he founded a company based on the prin ciple of buying term , not whole life , and investing the difference . Today , more than 100,000 people represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was grow  --  ing up , to be a lady was to be seden  --  tary , to sew . Fortunately , I did n't abide by those so-called rules . I loved sports and did a lot of good things for my skeleton . We ought to encourage young women to be active in sports : weight-bearing activity , muscle work , which helps create a positive calcium balance . If you put someone to bed , be it a child , a teen-ager or an adult , and especially the older person , there is no question what happens to their calcium . They have a big loss . " Comments from other symposium speakers will be included in future ar  --  ticles . In the meantime , even if your local medical facility is n't equipped to screen for bone loss , there is something very easy that you can do at home . Look at the wall where you last recorded family heights if you are in the habit of doing this . ( When our fam  --  ily has a gathering of the clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards between reunions by making marks with initials on the wall . ) If you have such marks , look at the wall and remeas  --  ure all the adults to see if anyone is losing ground . Then leave a mark on the wall where you can easily compare height periodically . All family members need to be sure that they are getting adequate calcium to prevent or reverse bone loss . A Fishing Lesson continued from page 51 else ' car and it is not your transmis  --  sion that is going to get torn out on a big rock . Even Finley seemed to be enjoying himself . Then we came to the road that leads up to the headwa  --  ters of the Big Muddy . " Hang a left there , " I told Finley . " A left where ? All I see is that rock slide coming down off the mountain . " " That 's it , buddy , " I said . We arrived at the Big Muddy with  --  out incident , and aside from the fact that Finley went about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still gripping a steer  --  ing wheel , we were all in fine fettle and high spirits . Finley even commentedthat he did n't know how he had man  --  aged to get through 43 years of life without fishing , he was having so much fun . " You ai n't seen nothing yet , " Retch told him . " Just wait till you ac  --  tually start fishing . " " I can hardly contain myself , " Finley said . Retch and I helped Finley rig up his tackle , and then we all cut down through the brush toward the Big Muddy . It was rough going , and the mosquitoes came at us like mess call at a fat farm . I led the way and did the best I could to point out the obstacles to the other two , but ap  --  parently I stepped right over one beaver hole without noticing it . Sud  --  denly I heard a strange sound and turned around to see what it was . I was shocked . There was Finley 's head resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was about as horrible a thing as I 've ever seen . Then the head spoke to me . " You gluteus maximus , " it said . " Why did n't you tell me about this hole ? " " I did n't see it , head , " I replied . " It looks pretty deep though  --  we better warn Retch about it . " " Ha ! " Finley said . " Whose shoul  --  ders do you think I 'm standing on ? " That was about the only real catas  --  trophe to befall us . The rest of the day was pretty much your routine fishing trip . Oh , Finley did lose his sack lunch and made quite a fuss about that , but it was nothing , really . As far as we could figure out , the lunch apparentlywashed out of the pocket in the back of his fishing vest . There was a pretty strong current at the place where he was trying to swim to the north bank of the Big Muddy , and that was prob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tually , I had thought there were good odds that Finley would make it all the way across that high log over the riv  --  er , even if he was running . But before Retch and I could shake hands on our bet , he ran right off into space and dropped like a shot into the river . Of course , I had n't taken into account that he was holding up his pants with one hand and had all those yellow-jackets swarming around him . I had told Finley that yellowjackets some  --  times hole up in old brush piles and do n't like to be dis  --  turbed , but he did n't listen . I wo n't go into how he was dis  --  turbing them or why he was holding up his pants with one hand , because it is n't espe  --  cially interesting . Anyway , to hear Finley tell it , you would think he was the only fisher  --  man to have such an experi  --  ence . You would think Retch and I had personally put those yellowjackets under that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , " it 's no big deal . Fish  --  ermen lose their lunches all the time . " I dug a sandwich out of my own fishing vest and gave it to him , and patted him on the shoulder . " Looks like peanut butter and jelly , " he said . I did n't have the heart to tell him it was supposed to be just peanut but  --  ter , even though I could have put those salmon eggs to good use . A difficult thing about introducing a guy to the sport of fishing is deter  --  mining whether it has taken hold of him . As we were driving back into town , I decided to ask him . " I 'm of two minds about it , " he replied . " One bad and one good . " " What 's the bad ? " " I wo n't be able to get out of bed for a week . " " What 's the good ? " " Next time we 're taking his car . " " Whose car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's whose , " he said . I could see Finley was hooked . Al  --  ready he had picked up one of the most important techniques . A
