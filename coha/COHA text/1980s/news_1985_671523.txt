Though replacing a tunnel ceiling may seem a relatively simple concept , the planning , design and execution of the $78. 3 million project may be every bit as significant as the construction of the tunnel itself. // No other motor vehicle tunnel in the world has undergone such major renovation , according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which operates the tunnel . If the Holland Tunnel ceiling project is successful - and the Port Authority fully expects it to be - it is expected to become the model for rebuilding other aging tunnels. // " Nothing like this has ever been done in any of our tunnels or any tunnel that I know of , " said Joseph P. Zitelli , manager of the Project Engineering Division of the Port Authority ' s Tunnels and Bridges Department. // An important element of the Port Authority ' s plan allows it to keep the tunnel open during the day . <> <> An Economic Limitation // " We ' ve come up with a way to replace a major component working just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most of it is going to be built offsite and trucked in . In the world of tunnels , what we ' ve done is almost equivalent to reinventing the wheel. " // In theory , the project does not seem to be quite as spectacular as Mr. Zitelli ' s description . All that it involves , in essence , is taking down the ceilings in the tunnel ' s two tubes - which have seriously deteriorated since they were built almost 60 years ago - and putting up new ones. // But engineers were faced with a key economic limitation . The Holland Tunnel - with a two-lane , 29. 5-foot diameter , 8 , 500-foot long tube going in each direction between Canal Street in lower Manhattan and Jersey City - is one of the city ' s lifelines , used by 80 , 000 vehicles each workday . Port Authority officials said they believed keeping the tubes open from dawn to dusk was vital to the economic well-being of lower Manhattan. // Three years ago , Port Authority officials began pumping design proposals and engineering calculations into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuilding the ceilings while keeping the road open. // The construction plans have attracted the attention of officials throughout the world who maintain aging tunnels . The site has been inspected by engineers from other American and European cities. // The Port Authority ' s concept is based on a modular design . The new ceilings will be made up of nearly 4 , 000 steel-reinforced , concrete panels . Each measures roughly 20 feet by 5 feet . Because each is built to fit a specific spot , no two panels are exactly alike. // The precast , five-inch thick panels with rows of white tiles on one side are being manufactured in Morehead City , N.C. , and shipped by truck to a staging site at the entrance to the tunnel in Jersey City. $600 , 000 for Tests The general contractor , the Morrison-Knudsen Company of Boise , Idaho , built two strange-looking , $150 , 000 , self-propelled vehicles to lift , turn and put the 8 , 000-pound panels into place . The lift trucks , counterbalanced by steel weights , are designed to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block the movement of other equipment. // The Port Authority spent $600 , 000 on tests , including videotaped demonstrations , to insure that the system would work . The first panels are scheduled to arrive in Jersey City early next month and be put into place before Thanksgiving. // " We expect the new roof to outlast the old one , " said Enoch Lipson , a design engineer with the Port Authority . " When it ' s finished , the tunnel is going to be in better shape than when it was first built. " // Completed in 1927 at a cost of $48. 4 million , the Holland Tunnel was the world ' s first mechanically ventilated , underwater , vehicular thoroughfare . Its ventilation system , the model for all succeeding vehicular tunnels , carries fresh air into the tunnel through chambers beneath the roads and draws exhaust fumes off through chambers above the ceilings . It uses 84 fans to keep air circulating . <> <> Cracks in the Ceilings // Widely regarded as one of the 20th century ' s great engineering achievements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical engineering landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers. // Though the tunnel ' s cast-iron exterior and reinforced concrete roads are in excellent condition , time has taken its toll on the ceilings , key facets of the ventilation system . Decades of exposure to exhaust gases and moisture have developed extensive cracks and other structural weaknesses in the concrete ceilings , officials said. // Without the ceilings , which protect the tunnel ' s shell in the case of fire as well as forming the channels for exhaust gases , the ventilation system will not work properly . After many attempts at patching the ceilings , it became apparent to Port Authority engineers in the early 1980 ' s that they would have to be replaced . <> <> Dusty , Noisy Work // Since December 1983 , the tunnel has been closed on weeknights and reopened before dawn . Each evening , construction vehicles line up at the Jersey City entrance , then move in under police escort . Workmen clad in white suits , dust masks , ear plugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tile and concrete . Within the tiled interior , the sound of steel punching stone is like the constant explosions of shotgun shells. // After more than a year of demolition , preparation work for replacing the south tube ceiling began last summer. // The Port Authority has also signed contracts to replace the tunnel ' s electrical and communication systems . In November , when crews begin installing up to 28 panels a night , more than 100 men will be working in the tunnel. // The south tube will be finished first , by next August . The north tube ' s ceiling is expected to be completed by September 1987. //
