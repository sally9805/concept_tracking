The great watering hole beneath the Great Plains is going dry <P> There are two documentary images of the Great Plains . The first is a black-and-white photograph of the ' 30s Dust Bowl , with windblown homesteaders treading the cracked earth . The second : a glossy color shot of the same land 40 years later , showing the lush checkerboard farms of America 's breadbasket . Now , as if through a strange reversal in time , the second image threatens to fade into the first . For in another 40 years , the territory could backslide into dust and despair . The Ogallala Aquifer , the vast underground reservoir of water that transformed much of the Great Plains into one of the richest agricultural areas in the world , is being sucked dry . <P> The aquifer is a California-size deposit of water-laden sand , silt and gravel . It ranges in thickness from 1,000 ft. in Nebraska , where two-thirds of its waters lie , to a few inches in parts of Texas . Although it was first tapped in the 1930s , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps after World War II . The Ogallala 's estimated quadrillion gallons of water , the equivalent of Lake Huron , have irrigated farms in South Dakota , Nebraska , Wyoming , Kansas , Colorado , Oklahoma , Texas and New Mexico , changing a region of subsistence farming into a $15 billion-a-year agricultural center . <P> For the past three decades , farmers have pumped water out of the Ogallala as if it were inexhaustible . Nowadays they disperse it prodigally through huge center-pivot irrigation sprinklers , which moisten circular swaths a quarter-mile in diameter . The annual overdraft ( the amount of water not replenished ) is nearly equal to the yearly flow of the Colorado River . Like all aquifers , the Ogallala depends on rain water for recharging , and only a trickle of the annual local rainfall ever reaches it . Gradually built up over millions of years , the aquifer is being drained in a fraction of that time . The question is no longer if the Ogallala will run dry , but when . <P> W.B. Criswell has been raising cotton on his 1,700-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the camel of crops because it requires little water , yet Criswell is now in trouble . His water table has dropped 100 ft. since he started farming . Nine years ago , he paid $4 an acre to water his cotton ; today he pays more than $45 . " It 's like a disease , " he says . " You just accept it and go on . " Gerald Wiechman farms 6,000 acres and feeds 2,500 head of steer near Scott City in western Kansas . When his farm 's first well started pumping , it tapped water at 54 ft . Today he has to go 130 ft . " I 've got another 20 years , maybe , " he reckons . On the High Plains of eastern Colorado , the water level has dropped as much as 40 ft. since the 1960s . In parts of Oklahoma , it has dipped that much in four years . Texas , the thirstiest of the eight states , has consumed 23% of its Ogallala reserves since World War II .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
