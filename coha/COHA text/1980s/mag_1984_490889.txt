Notes and Comment HE wide sea that seems to separate most of us from the der- elicts and the dirty street people and the homeless is really about as broad as the Harlem River up at 145th Street , where a good heave will land a rock safely in the Bronx  --  and this is not to speak of moral and sentimental , every-man-a-brother , children-of-one-God considerations . In purely practical terms , our lives are not nearly so far away as most of us imagine from those of the men with the matted beards who wander through Astor Place , those of the eternally tired women with their Shopwell plastic hags . It is the rare person who could not conceivably be reduced to the same raggedy shape by a combination of plausible circumstances  --  the loss of a job , the breakup of a marriage , an encounter with alcoholism , a bout of mental illness , a sudden disability . For most of us , misfortunes like these are mere catastrophes ; for some people , such events are enough to turn them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them think of the Port Authority bus station as home , enough to leave them happy to tat the congealed remains of a dinner that someone else tossed in the trash can . One reason for the different outcomes  --  maybe the main reason  --  is that most of us , when we fall , are saved by people who care enough to catch us , and who have the strength . A young Yale divinity student , Sam Todd , disappeared from a Mulberry Street party on New Year 's Eve . In the weeks since , his family and friends have staged a citywide hunt for him . His parents and brothers dropped their work and found an office in a Greenwich Village church , which they filled with city maps and lists of places to look . More than two hundred of his classmates and friends have come to New York and gone out to search . They have had posters made that show three photographs of Todd , and have plastered them on lampposts and mailboxes all over the city , even in the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelters for the city 's estimated forty thousand homeless and the soup kitchens that serve its numberless hungry  --  all places they think he might , perhaps suffering from amnesia , have gone . Though there are no firm leads , the effort continues , buoyed by police speculation that if Todd had been murdered his body would by now have surfaced . It is a sad , noble , and in every way inspiring search . It is also , to many of the down-and-out in this city , a baffling search . One night last month , we ourself happened to be in a small church shelter where ten otherwise homeless men were spending the night . Over a supper of bologna sandwiches , the discussion covered topics like who had cigarettes to spare and ( a crucial topic ) how cold it would get the next day . Someone noticed a news item in the paper about the Todd case , and the chat turned in his direction . AU the men knew about the search ; several had been questioned by Todd 's friends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave them about ten spots to look , but then again he might be a lot of places , " one man said . As happy as they all were to help  --  who would n't be ? ? it was clear that something essential about the huge effort eluded them . " I been missing twenty years , " said one grizzled man , " and no one come looking for me . " How could that be ? Is it perhaps that his mother loved him less the day he was horn ? That he never had friends who cared what happened to him ? Not likely , for the love of parents and the regard of friends are two of the very few things that do not change with income level , or years of schooling , or whether or not you have a job . It is not the love that is missing ; it is , first of all , the means to make that love count . Most of the people on skid row in New York or any other city come from backgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have jobs they can leave , or any resources to throw into the search , or even any understanding that such a thing is possible . If you 've spent your life in the clutches of the welfare system , say , or working for three bucks an hour off the books , it is less likely that you will have the gumption to make lists of places to visit , or to print up flyers . It is more likely that you will ask around , and that you will cry at night in bed . And even if you did find your son , your husband , your brother  --  what then ? What could you offer him save the same overcrowded apartment , the same stack of unpaid bills , the same hopelessness that drove him crazy , or to drink , or to despair , in the first place ? In fact , the entire idea of searching for a missing person makes little sense in this context . Most of the people on the Bowery did not end up there overnight , like Sam Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them are products of the sad fraction of our society where destitution is a perfectly plausible career . Unemployment among black young people is near fifty per cent ; is it so strange , then , that many of them have no place to sleep ? If Sam Todd had graduated from divinity school and got a call to some distant pulpit , his parents would not have had to go to his new home to search for him ; it would have been natural for him to move away . The parents of a child born in huge stretches of this city in these times must similarly regard as natural the chance that their son or daughter will end up homeless and distraught ; the calmness with which they must accept that fact defines their place in our society . Walking past a homeless person , especially when you 're on the way home , can make you uneasy . Just the concrete fact that you have something in abundance that that person needs so badly seems to demand some action . One thing to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't breed such despair . But that , if history is any guide , may take a little while , and in the meantime there are so many of these sad people  --  more every day . They are all , in some sense , missing persons , and they can all , each individually , be found  --  be fed , be clothed , be welcomed into shelter . That they are not in literal truth your brother or son or mother should perhaps make less difference than it usually does . ? FRIEND writes : In his speech to the nation declaring his willingness to spend another four years in the White House , President Reagan listed five areas in which " our work is not finished . " He told us , " We have more do in creating jobs , achieving control over government spending , returning more autonomy to the states , keeping peace in a more settled world , and seeing if we ca n't find room in our schools for God . " This last point was the most interesting ; it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before there was the bumper sticker ( even before there was the bumper ) , politicians were insisting that God was on their side . Now Reagan seems to he saying that he is on God 's side , ready to help Him out where he can . According to most theologies , God can go anywhere He wants . The situation is n't like the one back in the late nineteen-fifties , when white politicians ( who surely thought God was on their side ) blocked the doors of Southern schoolhouses so children who happened to be black could not get by . Those children had to wait for federal help . But God 's not like that , and neither is He like the superintendent making the teacher nervous by sitting at a desk in the back of the room and taking notes . What Reagan presumably meant was that he hoped to see schoolchildren allowed to pray during homeroom . Even aside from the fact that schoolchildren can pray now if they 're so moved , Reagan 's point seems completely backward , and almost disrespectful . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Mexico reciting the Lord 's Prayer , He certainly would n't have had to leave the classroom because the secular humanists and other latter-day devils prevented such a spectacle . And it 's not as if His movements were regulated by the Supreme Court , or the Kremlin , say . Everyone else may need the President 's help ; everyone else must venerate his office and acknowledge his authority and hope he uses his power wisely . Probably even God hopes he uses his power wisely . But God is not waiting for his invitation to drop in on the schools . Sentiment WE were window-shopping along Fifth Avenue the other morning on our way to work . The day had been glum and cold and gray , and then , all of a sudden , it turned pink . Every imaginable shade of pink . Pale pink , warm pink , hot pink , Shocking pink , red pink . Pink hearts . Pink balloons . More hearts . We were in front of the Hallmark Gallery . Valentines , of course . We walked in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the music stopped before we could make out which symphony it was . We heard the sound of spouting and fall ing water . We bent over the edge of a curving staircase and looked down onto a brightly lit circular fountain on the floor below . The wall to our right , almost fifty feet long , was a giant collage of valentine cards in a riot of primary colors . Facing the wall stood a single row of people bundled in dark overcoats , boots , mufflers , hats . Silent , heads bent , absorbed , reading . We spotted Teddy bears , Miss Piggys , owls , puppies , kittens , Snoopys , Mickey Mouses , and baby chicks . The cards were aligned in horizontal columns , nine high and from eight to twelve thick . Above most of the columns , a title was listed . We started at the back of the room with Aunt . After Aunt came Niece . Niece was followed by Nep . " What 's Nep ? " we asked a dour man in a fur cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nep is nephew , " he said without looking up . We walked past Brother , Sister , Son , Grandson , Granddaughter , Daughter , Grandparents , Dad , Mother and Dad , Mother , Husband , Sweetheart ( Sweetheart claimed the widest outpouring of sentiment : ten columns instead of the usual two or three ) , Wife , Baby , Juvenile , Miscellaneous . What was miscellaneous about a valentine ? We picked up a lacy Victorian heart and read , " On Your Valentine Birthday . " A row and a half of Miscellaneous was given over to cards in Spanish . " Para In. ; Esposa con anwr " ( " For my wife with love " ) . " Para ti , flbuelita " ( " For you , dear Grandmother " ) . " Salo pare ti " ( " Just for you " ) . Next came Our Wish , then Religious . We opened a card at random but found no religion . It began , like so many others , " For someone special . " We moved to General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his arm . " Meet me in the fiction section of the library , " he said . And , finally , Humorous . We picked two sardines sitting in a tin . " Love you ? " asked the caption above the tin . We opened the card . " I sardine-ly do , " it said . That did it . And we were going to he late for work . There was a long line at the checkout counter . We looked down at the fountain on the floor below . Four silent people were hastily putting up a cordon around it . Had somebody waded in ? Fallen in ? Nothing seemed to make any sense . Then we brushed past a very young , very skinny Hispanic boy with just a trace of a mustache . He was addressing a salesTHE NEW YORKER man with his hands . They were both silent . Then the boy broke into a Spanish litany . The salesman interrupted him to ask , in despair , " But what sentiment are you looking for ? " A hystanding young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , if she could be of help . " Es pro mi abuela por el dia de San Valentin , " he said , and smiled . Suddenly , everything fell back into place . The young woman guided him to Miscellaneous and handed him exactly the card he had been looking for  --  the one that began " Para ti , Abuelita . " Restoration WE have heard from a Manhattan friend who had some medical work done in Boston a few months ago , at Massachusetts General Hospital ( he could n't walk , and they got him walking again ) , and who went back to Boston recently for a brief checkup and a happy visit : Whenever I feel especially peppy , I go to Boston . Would have a hard time explaining this , but there it is . Boston is the only place I know that uses the words " scrod " and " schrod " interchangeably . They both mean a young cod or haddock . I merely throw this in for local color . Took the Metroliner from Penn Station . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , and not having to worry about a socked-in LaGuardia or a socked-in Logan . A purely personal prejudice , this , and not to be taken seriously by upwardly mobile executives . Had to mail letter in Penn Station before departure . Just try to find a mailbox in the hideous , claustrophobic warren that is now Penn Station . Just try . Searched everywhere . " Over by the orange juice , " said one man . " Behind the newsstand , " said another . " There is no mailbox in this station , " said a third . Finally , found an obscure slot in a brick abutment adjoining a ? ? stairwell in the waiting room . Mailed letter . Onto train . Lovely , roomy car , with ample legroom . Stewardess offered Continental breakfast , on the house . " Juice , Danish , and coffee , Hon , " she said . " Or tea , Hon.

Industrial intrusion near Route 128 , with windowless red warehouses . Into South Station at precise moment of expected arrival : 12:09 . Boston a manageable , proportional city . Extraordinary sense of freedom and restoration at being able to walk again , so I walked . Took long , confident strides to Massachusetts General , where miracle doctors pronounced joy at my recovery . Walked all over the place  --  along Charles Street , admiring bookstores , pub fronts , food shops . Old-fashioned storefronts that anywhere else would , appear to be spurious , but not in Boston . Took the T. This is the subway . So many young people , so many beards , so many heavily booted feet , but no graffiti . Seemed everybody a student , including girl violinist sawing away in Park Street Station . Paid brief visit to Harvard Square ( Red line ) and to the old Yard  --  quite romantic in the snow . Dropped in at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot to the Common , entering Common from dry land in area ( known two centuries ago as Round Marsh ) where , on April 18 , 1775 , eight hundred British troops took off in barges and boats for Cambridge and the beginning of some Real Troubles . Common and adjoining Public Garden a winter delight . No swan boats , of course , or flower beds , but proper sparrows , chickadees , and blue jays . Sat , bewitched , in room overlooking snow-covered Public Garden . A perfect Glackens , with delicate iron fence , shovelled paths , and Beacon Hill and the rest of city misty-blue behind . Seeing imaginary pictures propelled me to Museum of Fine Arts , FEBRUARY 13 , 1984 that Millet was a fussy , nervous , anxious painter , who went over and over his pictures , cropping them , repainting them , being dissatisfied . He was an uncertain man in many things ; when giving directions to friends coming to visit him in Barbizon , for instance , had a tendency to repeat the directions many times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Stebbins , who is in his forties , wearing brown suit , yellow shirt , green tie . An expert on American art and the author of , among other works , a book on Martin Johnson Heade . Recently organized much-acclaimed exhibition of celebrated American paintings that opened in Boston , went to the Corcoran , and is headed for the Louvre  --  first exhibition entirely of American paintings at Louvre in fifty years . Stebbins has given good deal of thought to the intensity of revival of interest in American paintings  --  especially paintings of nineteenth century , including the works of Frederick Church . " I think that the trauma of Vietnam made people go back to the earlier American pictures and take another look , " he said . " People had a feeling they were missing something , and a new sensibility developed . " Also , looking at some of the beautiful nineteenth-century landscapes made them realize the dreadful ravages inflicted upon the countryside by industrial encroachment .

Gol drac h explai ned New Clothes A time passes , opportunity narrows . We 're never going to have our own rock-and-roll combo  --  never smash instruments onstage , never be dragged from our limo by screaming groupies , never have the guardians of traditional American values burn our records in bonfires . Slowly , we 've made our peace with those sad truths . Late last month , in an effort to quell another fantasy  --  one that recurs every four years  --  we drove out on Long Island , to the Marriott Hotel in Uniondale , where the people who will be competing in the winter Olympics were picking up the outfits they 'll be wearing this week in Sarajevo . Wherever we looked in the hotel lobby  --  in the Caf ? Lido , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potted ficus trees  --  we saw wellTHE NEW YORKER muscled , handsome young men and women radiating the sort of happy confidence that comes from knowing you are able to skate faster than other people . The crowd was even thicker on the hotel 's third floor , where Levi Strauss , which is the outfitter of this year 's winter and summer Olympics , was handing out the duds . As soon as we got off the elevator , we were taken in tow by Nancy Peterson , a company public-relations woman , who used to publicize the Stanford football team . She showed us a rack holding the thirty-two specially designed items  --  from a fleece-lined sheepskin jacket to red polypropylene long johns  --  that each athlete will receive . " They are , for the most part , color-coOrdinated , " Nancy said . " The colors  --  red , white , and royal blue  --  were sort of chosen in advance for us . This parka here is what they 'll wear if they win a medal . The front is blue and red , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast with the underarm area , which is white . All our clothes are designed to photograph well . " Nancy introduced us to Mary Ann Buxton , who is in charge of the entire Olympics-outfitting process for Levi Strauss . ( The company , before the year is up , will have handed out some seven hundred thousand garments . ) She told us it had been difficult to design clothes that looked nice on all the Olympians . " You take a gymnast , a basketball player , and a weight lifter ? it is hard to imagine three more different body types , " she said . " Also , sometimes there are special problems . Fencers , for instance  --  they 're likely to have one leg that 's much more developed and larger than the other , because they 're always lunging . " Mary Ann , who lives just north of San Francisco , competes in the non-Olympic discipline known as the triathlon , the worst variety of which requires a swim of two and a half miles , immediately followed by a bicycle race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no rest , a regulation marathon . " Long Island is O.K. , " she told us , " but I went out to run and there was all this crusty ice . And no hills . " While we were talking over the triathlon with Mary Ann , up walked Lyle Nelson , who is competing in his third straight Olympics in the biathlon , a somewhat puzzling event that requires him to ski long distances cross-country , shoot at targets with a rifle , and then ski some more . Nelson , who , at thirty-five , is the veteran of the biathlon squad , said he plans to compete at the Calgary , Alberta , Olympics in 1988 and then retire . " I train less and less each year , and I get better and better , " he told us , without a trace of boasting in his voice . " I try to train efficiently , and to apply my sports-psychology program really well  --  my goal-setting , my attitude-control , that sort of thing . If I 'm hitting the target with seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' I 'm not going to blink , I am going to hit eighty per cent . ' I have to find out why I see myself as a seventy-fiveper-cent shooter . " Nelson lives in Serene Lakes , California , a town that he said lived up to its name . " It 's a great place , just where I-80 crests going into California . I ca n't think of a better place to live  --  the snow just dumps on us . All winter long , it 's shovel , shovel , shovel , so it drives the fainthearted away . " As we were heading back toward the lobby , Nancy offered us an Olympic T-shirt for our own . What we really wanted , of course , was a red wool sweater with blue and white stripes and the Sarajevo emblem , and a blue velour warmup suit with " U.S.A. " on the back , and a round-trip ticket to Yugoslavia , and the chance to cross-country ski a little and shoot a little , and win some medals for our country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride during the national anthem , and go to the White House to shake hands with the Reagans , and endorse a certain breakfast food ( one we actually liked , and could recommend in good conscience ) , and hang our medals over the fireplace , and acquire some grandchildren to show them to . But do n't get us wrong  --  we took the T-shirt .
