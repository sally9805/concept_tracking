At the climax , we ' re teetering from the edge of a blasted-out penthouse . Our heroes , with ' ' unlicensed nuclear accelerators ' ' strapped to their backs , are valiantly rescuing New York from a giant advertising figure made of marshmallow and somehow mixed up with ancient Sumeria. // And that ' s ' ' Ghostbusters ' ' in a nutshell . It starts with the sort of lowbrow , smart-aleck farce you ' d expect from Murray and Dan Aykroyd , who star along with Harold Ramis and Sigourney Weaver . It ends with the wildest explosion of plot twists and visual effects this side of Steven Spielberg ' s fantasy factory . The treat of this ambitious comedy is that it values flamboyant imagination as well as earthy ( sometimes coarse ) humor . If the Three Stooges met ' ' The Exorcist , ' ' this is what it would be like. // It ' s interesting that other current hits , like ' ' Gremlins ' ' and the ' ' Indiana Jones ' ' epic , also make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same scene and even the same image . ' ' Ghostbusters ' ' puts the accent on laughs rather than shivers , of course , given the comedy credentials of its writers ( Ackroyd and Ramis ) and its stars . But the science-fantasy element is played for all it ' s worth , too , actually stealing the farce ' s thunder now and then . Credit goes largely to Richard Edlund ' s extravagant camera effects , and to the screenplay ' s knack for pushing outlandish ideas a big step farther than expected. // In both the funny and the ( mildly ) scary moments , the cast does itself proud . I ' ve never been a fan of Aykroyd or Murray , but I enjoyed seeing them as restrained as they are here - hamming it up in the big scenes , true , but also pulling off sly jokes with small gestures and changes of expression . Ramis makes a nicely deadpan foil for them , and Sigourney Weaver has a great time with a role that ' s both playfully romantic and wackily demonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods : Rick Moranis as the world ' s worst party-giver , Annie Potts as a bored receptionist , Ernie Hudson as an assistant who ' ll believe in spooks if there ' s a paycheck in it , and William Atherton as a Fed who tries to bust the ghostbusters. // The picture was directed by Ivan Reitman , who can sink to the most obvious kind of four-letter humor , then rebound with a clever touch or even a lovely one , as when Murray celebrates an upturn in his love life by spinning in ecstatic circles on a sunny Manhattan plaza . Although the project reportedly cost more than $30 million to complete , Reitman keeps the mood airy and light with only a few portentous lapses , mostly avoiding the temptation to grandiosity that spoiled such past disappointments as ' ' 1941 ' ' and ' ' The Blues Brothers . ' ' This is a silly movie , not delicate or subtle , but generally fun . I expect it will be with us for a very large part of the still-young summer season. // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mark as a slam-bang director of empty action pictures . His latest , ' ' Streets of Fire , ' ' is particularly slam-bang and empty , even by his high standard . You can see it as a tawdry melodrama or an exercise in pure cinema , but nothing in between . It ' s so stylized it ' s almost abstract. // The plot starts when a bad guy named Raven kidnaps a rock singer he has a crush on . Her old boyfriend and her mercenary manager ( their names are Tom Cody and Billy Fish ) go to the rescue , helped by a macho woman named McCoy . Near the beginning , Tom Cody burns down a section of the city . Near the end , he and Raven slug it out with sledgehammers . Yet the picture has a PG rating , so adept is director Hill at glossing over mayhem with a slick cinematic sheen. // The secret of watching ' ' Streets of Fire ' ' - subtitled ' ' A Rock &; Roll Fable ' ' - is to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can find a goggle-eyed pleasure in its bizarre plot twists and rock-video rhythms . Some of the performances are also enjoyable in a rude sort of way , especially Willem Dafoe as the deftly demonic villain . It ' s a minor picture and sometimes a nasty one . But its energy is impressive. // // ' Coalfields ' // Though its title suggests a dry documentary , ' ' Coalfields ' ' is an offbeat movie poem . Using a number of visual devices , including his own method of combining different images in one frame , filmmaker Bill Brand explores the industrial terrain of West Virginia with attention to political , economic , and personal matters while advancing his own film idiom at the same time. // The result is a dense and stimulating work , if a somewhat mysterious one . It will have its premiere tomorrow night at the Collective for Living Cinema in New York. // On one level , ' ' Coalfields ' ' deals with very objective subjects , including the problems of coal miners and the political difficulties of solving them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , though - he admits to being known as a ' ' formal purist ' ' - and over this footage he places a layer of complex , essentially abstract imagery that both interrupts and complements the basic material . This imagery is fragmented into crisp , angular shapes that suggest anything from lumps of coal to swarming birds . ( Brand ' s father and grandfather were ornithologists , and his earlier film ' ' Chuck ' s Will ' s Widow ' ' has strong bird associations. ) // Adding still more layers to ' ' Coalfields ' ' is a poem by Kimiko Hahn , ' ' sound composition ' ' by Earl Howard , and narration by a politically active miner . Brand tells me the film ' s objective content doesn ' t signal a move away from aesthetic purism and toward more socially oriented filmmaking , but it is rather a supplement to the formal concerns that still interest him most . Be that as it may , ' ' Coalfields ' ' is an inventive and visually provocative achievement. // //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
