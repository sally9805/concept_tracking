Search for U.S. General Dozier <P> Wearing bulletproof vests and carrying machine guns , a 2,000-man Italian force combed northern Italy last week as the massive manhunt continued for kidnaped U.S. Brigadier General James Dozier . Acting on a tip , scores of officers swarmed over tiny Ponte Alto ( pop . 91 ) , searching dozens of houses and stopping cars on snowy roads , but they found no trace of the 50-year-old Army general who was abducted from his apartment in Verona on Dec. 17 . The Italian government sent hundreds of reinforcements and alpine troops to join the search . At a roadblock near Padua , four suspected terrorists were arrested at gunpoint and held for interrogation , though any connection with the abduction of the American general was not revealed . <P> The Italian government , with U.S. support , restated its policy of " inflexible firmness " in refusing to negotiate with the terrorists for the return of Dozier , the deputy chief of staff for logistics and administration at NATO 'S southern Europe land forces headquarters in Verona . However , police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $167,000 , for valuable information on the case . Moreover , by week 's end a group of Dozier 's friends had put up a $1.6 million reward for information leading to the general 's release . <P> Italy 's Prime Minister , Giovanni Spadolini , called the Red Brigades ' action " a quantum leap in which the terrorists are trying to transform their armed movement into an armed party . " He said that the Italian secret service was investigating possible ties between the Red Brigades and West Germany 's Red Army Faction , a band of left-wing terrorists mentioned as potential allies by Dozier 's captors . The West German group has been linked by authorities to the September attempt near Heidelberg on the life of General Frederick Kroesen , commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe . Said Spadolini : " The explicit attack on NATO , the connection with the attack in Germany , demonstrates that in the new strategy of terrorism there is a prevailing international objective . " <P> Meanwhile , police experts were analyzing copies of a photograph distributed by the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding a placard inscribed with leftist slogans . It read , in part : " The crisis of capitalism generates an imperialist war . Only an anti-imperialist civil war can end the war . " A communiqu , the second that authorities have received from Dozier 's captors , and a separate 188-page document accompanied the photo . The rambling tract , titled " Strategic Directives December 1981 , " was the first discussion of the Red Brigades ' new policy of violent confrontation with NATO . It also called on other left-wing terrorist groups to unite in the struggle and implied that efforts had been made to infiltrate the pacifist movement in Italy .
