A runner is a small-boned loner , built for flight and fantasy .  --  DR . GEORGE SHEEHAN . // Twenty years ago , Gerry Lindgren was America 's finest distance runner , a beloved and cheerful man . When his racing career ebbed , he settled with his wife Betty in Taco-ma , Wash. , where he opened a running store . They had three children . Then , in 1980 , he vanished . // Over the years , there were rumors of widely separated " sightings "  --  in Texas , in Hawaii  --  but Lindgren eluded all attempts by family , friends and reporters to find him . Where he had gone , and why , evolved into a perplexing mystery . // Lindgren was always delicate . Injuries kept him from two Olympics . An ulcer gnawed at him for most of his career . Yet he seemed to respond to every setback with jests and looniness . He was mysterious long before he disappeared , and central to his mystery , then and now , was the question of whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1963 . He was breaking away from the start of an all-star high school mile in Eugene , Ore . I stood on the infield and I laughed at him , a sparrow of a kid in oversized purple shorts . His limbs were doughy white and went all blotchy as he sprinted the first quarter in a sacrificial 60 seconds flat . // I was 19 and a University of Oregon runner . I knew what that pace would do . The kid would die . The favorite , the fastest schoolboy miler in the west , Tracy Smith , was poised behind , tan and relaxed , almost bored by this pathetic bid for a little temporary notice . // And sure enough , toward the half mile the kid slowed . Smith , with all sense and right on his side , moved wide and went around . But the kid jumped as if he had been slapped , and dashed back into the lead . // Smith tried again . Once more the kid flew into an outlandish sprint . The crowd saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the final lap you could see Smith swear to himself that this scrawny creature was going to stay passed . He dropped his arms and launched an all-out kick . He drew even . The kid reacted . They sprinted a wild last 220 , neck and neck . Smith frantically dived for the tape and fell to the dusty cinders . For a while , no one knew who had won . // Smith just lay there , scraped and dazed . Lindgren trotted around wheezing and finally flopped down on the grass near me . He was jug-eared and had rodent teeth . When it was announced that he had won in 4:12.9  --  Lindgren 's fastest time by 5.4 seconds  --  he came out with a high-pitched , awestruck voice and said how lucky he was that all these super runners had let him win the race . // He was 17 , a senior at John R. Rogers High School in Spokane , and his person was an affront to bedrock beliefs . Runners were lean and corded . Runners took years to develop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible muscle . Moreover , what I had just seen him do had to have made him suffer . But he did n't look it . The gulf between his appearance and performance was so immense that it seemed something outside of nature had happened , something surreal and disturbing . // The following winter he set high school records at two and three miles indoors . Then , in the summer of 1964 , he ran against the Russians . // The annual U.S.- U.S.S.R. dual meets that had begun in 1958 were charged with Cold War dread . The great crowds that turned out in both nations accorded these events the gravity of history . // On July 25 , 1964 , eight months after John F. Kennedy was assassinated , his brother Robert was among the 50,519 in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . In the 10,000 meters , the Soviet Union entered Leonid Ivanov and Nikolai Dutov . The U.S. entered Lindgren and one other runner . An American had never won this race . // It was 93 ? on the track . The Soviets set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? miles , he was still there , flushed and frightened . The U.S. coach , Sam Bell , called to him to lead , if he could . // Lindgren obeyed . He sprinted an entire lap , pulling to a 15-yard lead . The move seemed too hard , too early . But again he showed that feral ability to keep going after a killing burst . He ran the last mile through cheers so loud he thought he was being challenged . When he crossed the line , he turned to see he had won by 150 yards . In the crowd , Robert Kennedy 's face was wet with tears . // Asked how he had kept going near the end , Lindgren said , " I knew people would judge our system by this one race . I could n't let America down . I had to do my best . " // No running boom echoed on after him , as it would when Frank Shorter won the Olympic marathon eight years later , because the celebration of Lindgren was not , at its heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous fulfillment of a ravenous national wish of the moment . // Lindgren shared in the astonishment , saying , " Think of it . I 'm just a little boy . " He turned out to be a playful , chatty one . He had n't noticed the heat , he said , because he had been running in the shade of the taller Russians . " I thought it was raining until I realized it was drops of sweat off their brows . " He was a hero , and a character . // That fall he went to the Tokyo Olympics , turned an ankle in training and finished a disappointing ninth in the 10,000 . The race was won , in a spectacular upset , by his U.S. teammate Billy Mills . // Lindgren enrolled at Washington State in 1965 , and was at once caught up in the war between the NCAA and the Amateur Athletic Union . The colleges developed the most athletes . But the AAU governed international competition for all U.S. track athletes , and allowed the NCAA no role in this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordered all its athletes out of AAU races , on pain of losing their scholarships and collegiate eligibility . // Lindgren defied the NCAA boycott and ran the 1965 AAU six-mile in San Diego . When he and Mills raced to a shared world-record 27:11.6 , he was a hero again , and those of us who had knuckled under to the NCAA had a lesson in courage . // At Congressional hearings on the NCAA-AAU feud two months later . Lindgren said his decision to run had been one of conscience . " I just remembered why I was a runner , " he said . " That was to be the best representative I could be . So it was wrong to be forced to choose between my country and my school . " He kept his scholarship . And now he was a moral front-runner as well . // At WSU he won 11 NCAA championships in cross country and indoor and outdoor track , breaking the record of 8 set by Jesse Owens at Ohio State in 1935 and ' 36 . But a strained Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In 1969 , Lindgren , Shorter and I roomed together on an AAU tour of European meets . Lindgren was always bursting out in Russian , his college minor ( his major was political science ) . He was clearly bright , but so lightheartedly offbeat , so off-subject , that he was sometimes hard to take seriously . // Our hotel in London was near a finishing school for American girls . I remember Lindgren borrowing a broom from the maid 's cart and standing on the steps of the school and saying to every girl going in or out , " Hey , doll , you get a broom and I 'll get a broom and we 'll be broommates and sweep together . " // After he graduated , he had a teaching position lined up in Marysville , Wash. , but lost it when he was drafted . He spent 47 miserable days at Fort Lewis , Wash. , before the Army finally believed that he had a serious ulcer and discharged him . I happened to be a PFC working in the public information office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Lindgren put it ) , and we shared quarters under the post stadium . // Lindgren looked the same sick or well , but he looked especially sick in Army green . I remember him as a passive , pale waif in stiff , oversized fatigues , carrying his little carton of half-and-half around the snowy base . Still , against my pleading , he tried to run two or three times a day . // " The army episode seems pivotal , " says Bob Payne , who for years watched and wrote about Lindgren for The Spokesman-Review in Spokane . " It kind of knocked him off course , and led to the Glenn Turner stuff . " // Ah , yes , the Dare to Be Great phase . In the early ' 70s , Lindgren embraced the nationwide cosmetics franchising and motivational schemes that were the brainchild of Florida supersalesman Glenn Turner . Turner 's operation was eventually shut down in assorted court actions because of the fraudulent nature of its endlessly pyramiding structure of franchises , but not before Lindgren became an " international motivational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilling one 's potential . // This was especially curious . In 1964 he had carefully removed and returned the film , deodorant and other toiletries that were in the kit given to each U.S. Olympian . " Commercial tie-ins are deceptive , " he had said . " They imply that Chap Stick and this other junk actually help you make the team . " How could a guy like that align himself with a shark like Turner ? // Lindgren trained hard with an eye to Munich , a staggering 50 miles a day during one stretch in 1971 . Two weeks before the Olympic trials , he had a collision with a car and injured his knee . Nevertheless , he went to the trials in Eugene , where " Go Pre ! " was the crowd 's chant for the local favorite , Steve Prefontaine . Lindgren incited bedlam when he warmed up in a STOP PRE T-shirt , knowing he had no chance to do so . Prefontaine won the 5,000 in an American record 13:22.8 , ran his victory lap in Lindgren 's T-shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the International Track Association , the fledgling pro track tour . He had always considered under-the-table payments to " amateurs " to be hypocritical and had never accepted them . Now as a pro he could take money openly , but he ran poorly . The ITA folded in 1976. // After that , I lost touch with him . I heard he had opened a running store in Tacoma named , with typical grandeur , Gerry Lindgren 's Stinky Foot . // And then , suddenly , in 1980 , I read that he had disappeared . There seemed to be no hint of foul play . He had left a note for Betty to do what she wanted with the business . // This was serious . But it was n't unbelievable . " If you 'd asked us whether anyone on the U.S. team would find it necessary to vanish without a trace and start a new life , we 'd have said no way , " said Shorter . " But if you said one of us was going to do that , we 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all kept an eye out for him . Anyone who had seen him race would recognize that stride at 300 yards . In 1981 a cross-country runner from the University of Hawaii , Becky Russell , saw Lindgren in Honolulu , selling shoe soles out of a pushcart . He was using the name Gale Young . I was in Hawaii that same year for the Honolulu Marathon and got a number for Lindgren from the cancelled check of one of his customers . // When I called the number I thought a girl had answered . I said who I was , and that I had just hoped to chat with an old friend who might be going by the name of Gale Young . The voice on the phone dropped into a keening wail of what seemed recognition and then said hesitantly , " No , no , I think ... I think you probably have the wrong guy . " // I knew it was Lindgren . He went on in a rush about how he occasionally was mistaken for that runner , what was his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that guy could run .... // And then , suddenly , he was speaking to me in his natural voice . " You just over for the marathon ? Things in Eugene the same ? " That lasted for a few sentences , then the first , strained tone cut back in . " No , no , " he said . " I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I hope you find the guy you 're looking for but I 'm not him . " // He hung up . I sat there , shaken . The conversation had been so strange and his rejection so full of agony that it paralyzed me. // The next day Shorter and I talked about what , if anything , we should do . We thought we probably could locate him , but we hesitated . We did n't know the reason for his flight . If it was illness , then would pressing ourselves on him make him worse ? We could n't answer . So we went home to wait until he might be more approachable . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oahu . Brian Clarke , an old Oregon teammate of mine , assured me Lindgren was in or near Honolulu , still calling himself Gale Young , and got his telephone number from a marathon entry form . I called and left a message with a person who spoke with a mock Oriental accent . I said that I hoped Mr. Young might call me back . // So what did he do ? He called me back , as Gerry Lindgren , all squeaky and matter-of-fact , asking if I wanted to take a run . We jabbered , both breathless , of our respective injuries . He seemed to drink in news of mutual friends . // He came to dinner one evening , appearing jauntily at the door , pale even in the tropics , carrying a plate of sashimi , raw fish . " This is special , " he deadpanned . " It came from the last blue whale . " // His face was a little more lined , but he was still trim and gave me the sense of being the same man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , had he been unhinged . When I asked him about our phone conversation five years earlier , he said he did n't know what I was talking about . // I finally worked up the nerve to say that those he had left behind were anxious to know what had become of him . He was surprisingly revealing in his response . One of the things he said before the evening was over was that the controlling fact of his running career was grave self-doubt . " I began out of feeling worthless , " he said . " I was the classic wimp . I was told by my first coach that being good was out of the question , but if I devoted myself and ran hard , I could be an example to the other guys , who could be good . " // So he ran , he said , to explore the limits of devotion , to be of service . // He was desperate still to inspire . " I was filled with all these lemons , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wanted to show that even of these I could make lemonade . " // Over the following months he popped up at my house at odd intervals and poured out his story . // All I can tell you with certainty is that I , for one , have no self .... What I have instead is a variety of impersonations I can do ....  --  PHILIP ROTH , The Counterlife // He was born on March 9 , 1946 , the third son of Eleanor and Myrl Lindgren . " I almost lost Gerry at birth , " says Eleanor Lindgren Roullier over coffee in her spare frame house in Spokane . She passed to Gerry the shape of his nose and timbre of his voice . // " He was transverse . They did n't want to do a cesarean section , so they turned him around the best they could , to a breech position . They broke his arm doing it . I did n't see him for two weeks . When I finally did , the nurse told me she was happy he 'd made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the incubator . He was almost black from the ordeal of his birth . I knew then he was special . An extra hand helped me bring him into the world . " // The child soon found himself snarled in mixed signals . His mother loved him , but he felt his father resented him . " My husband was sometimes like a baby himself , " says Eleanor . " He picked on Gerry , and I would n't stand for it , although I did let him pick on the older boys . That caused friction . I imagine Gerry 's memory of growing up was pretty raw . " // " My father rejected me because I was weak , " Lindgren says now . " He was the tough drinker . I could n't be his son . " // His mother has told this story . When Gerry was three or four , and a vocal , alert child , he sat in a chair in the kitchen and began to sing a little children 's song . " Open all the windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // His father backhanded him off the chair . Gerry climbed back on , fixed his eyes on his father and sang again . Again his father struck him to the floor . // A third time Gerry climbed up and sang , and again he was knocked away . Then Eleanor came running in , trying to defend him . When the blows finally ended and Myrl Lindgren had stormed out , there on the chair stood Gerry , red-faced and furious , screaming out his song . " Open all the windows ! Open all the doors ! ... " // The scene reaches across his life . In being torn from his mother 's womb , he had learned animal pain . Now , in this home 's unpredictable strife , his consciousness worked at forming who he was . He blamed himself for the fighting . He was at the center of it . If he were not here , it would not happen . Each new skirmish hardened the idea into an inner sword . Never in his life would he be sure of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there the instinct to fight back . He sensed two traps . He had no strength , so he could not win . And if he fought , he would be caught up in fighting , in the thing he hated . So he would endure the pain and not be reached by it . He would stand and sing , but he would not fight back . And in the singing he would insist on how the world ought to be . He would will reality . // Lindgren says he was afraid of his father and came to avoid him . Myrl Lindgren denies the incident and says he was never unnecessarily hard on him . He asserts that the issue was Eleanor 's favoritism toward Gerry . " I tried to push him to responsibility , " Myrl says . " The trouble was , the wife and I were trying to hurt each other . We both did a good job of it . The kids were in the middle . " // Growing up , Gerry was not on intimate terms with his brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . In school , people laughed at him . So he played for laughs , accentuating his voice with unearthly yodels , adopting a pun-filled manner . " I think I got a lot of it from watching The Bull-winkle Show , " says Lindgren now . // He ran everywhere , at a time when this was thought abnormal . In junior high Gerry did a 2 ? - mile afternoon newspaper route on the run , then ran with the track team at Shaw Junior High . " Later he would n't get his driver 's license , " says Eleanor . " He said he did n't want to get lazy and stop running . But he 'd run miles and miles and then would n't take the garbage out . ' Mom , ' he 'd tell me , with that sparkle , ' it 's the short trips that kill a guy . ' " // When he reached high school , Lindgren found , at long last , a father figure . Tracy Walters , track coach and guidance counselor at Rogers High , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discipline . Lindgren imprinted on him as he had on no human . " I was enraptured , " Lindgren says . " He filled my head with ideas a wimp should never hear . He had an athletic code of honor that I was really ready to adopt . Live to make the world a better place . Be unselfish . " // Lindgren insists that it was Walters who at first encouraged him to run less to win than to be an exemplary stable-mate . But Walters , now 56 and retired to a vigorous orchardist 's life , says that might have been in Lindgren 's thoughts , but he did n't put it there . " The idea of telling someone he 'll never be good himself , just a good example , is foreign to me , " Walters says . " That 's the worst thing for a guy like Gerry to hear . " // Walters held to the rare belief that it was fine for a boy to work as hard as a seasoned man . " You cheat yourself if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Here , at last , was someone asking for what Lindgren could give : the endurance of pain in exchange for a new reality . Running would be his song . // He trained in every weather . His runs were escape and mastery combined . " I could never get used to the feeling that I , a kid with absolutely no athletic ability , could force my body to go so surely , " he says . " I was in ecstasy . " // The rapture made him feel purified . Again and again he had to go through this fire . Always he had to burn in order to feel worthy . When he ran , ran supremely hard , he was a changeling . // He found a friend . " There is no greater gift to a runner than a running partner , " says Len Long , now a high school teacher and championship cross-country coach in Spokane . He is classically gaunt and a head taller than his old teammate . // Long called Gerry " Lingerman , " and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mornings , racing ten miles at night , running in cloth wrestling shoes until they fell off our feet , with no acknowledgment that volume of work causes injury , " Long says , putting the heel of his hand to his forehead . " It was ridiculous . Gerry was immune to heat , cold , hills . I died off at everything . " // Only Lindgren 's prodigious recuperative powers kept him from being crippled . Even so , he had two stress fractures in his first two years of high school . // " He was known as the funny little guy who even mowed the lawn while running , " says Long . " He liked that . It was his persona . He was n't like Jim Ryun , who avoided fame . He enjoyed it . He was somebody . And making his mark in running gave him the confidence to try other things . " // Enter girls , a trainload of girls . " He was always happiest when he had a lady friend , " says Long . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of girls , from all of the schools . A lot of our summer mileage was in what Gerry called ' girling workouts . ' He would say , ' I 'll come over and see you on Saturday , ' to a number of girls , and then we would run between their houses , and after four or five you got a sideache because of all the punch and cookies and potato chips . Later in life , though , his inveterate flirting was an irritant . Even after he married , he would still caress the hand of the girl giving change at the register . " // His first state championship cross-country race , around Seattle 's Green Lake in 1961 , was , like Lindgren himself , a jumble of the comic and heroic . Four hundred runners sprinted away from the start , and in the melee someone pulled Lindgren 's shorts down . By the time he got them up , he was buried in the pack . He ran extra yards over higher ground in order to reach the front . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through hundreds of ducks and geese that had moved in off the lake . The other runners let him flail , buffeted and bitten , to clear a path . Lindgren held on to finish second , a revealing success . // But he had a different view of this success than anyone else . " I could n't make it understood that what was memorable was those damn ducks , " he says . " Friends and even coach saw only my high finish . " They saw his merit . He would not . // This was the beginning of a deepening cycle of self-effacement . The next spring , as a high school junior , Lindgren outkicked a runner named Jim Simons to win the state mile , and felt " ashamed . " // " Jim was a senior , " he says . " He deserved to win . I felt I 'd cheated him . " // His peculiar logic had become airtight . If he won , he was unhappy , for he had defeated others more worthy . If he lost , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " says Walters , looking back . " I mistook it for modesty . He was never a great taker of compliments . He relished the competition and strategy , but not the victory itself . " // Even running 8:40 for two miles indoors , faster than anyone his age ( he was 17 ) had ever run , could not convince Lindgren of his athletic worth . " If I 'd seen someone run 8:40 when I was in junior high , I 'd have thought it superhuman , " he says now . " But when I 'd run it , " I did n't think it was such a big deal because I was n't a big deal . " // Then he beat the Soviets , and came to glory . And when he read the newspaper stories , he cringed . " The more distant from me people were , the more they seemed to attribute my success to something in a secret place , deep inside my cells , " he says . In other words , they called him talented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of that . He rejects it still . He believes he accomplished what he did because of intelligent goals , devoted work and staunch belief . Other people may have talent . He may not . // A year later , when the NCAA ordered him out of the AAU championships , the pressures were remarkable . " Run that race , " Lindgren recalls his Olympic coach , Bob Giegengack of Yale , cautioning him , " and you 'll never get into another NCAA school . " He got 300 calls a week , one of which included a threat to burn down his mother 's house if he ran . // Lindgren , in turmoil , went to Walters , who told him only to follow his " heart . Lindgren 's heart , naturally , said to stand and sing and take the consequences . " Had I been normal , I think I could have bowed to all the pressure , " says Lindgren . " But I had a mission . " // He ran . Mills , the Olympic champion , got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hit the home stretch together . " I suddenly felt guilty , " recalls Lindgren . " Billy had led , Billy had been tough . It was wrong to steal his just reward . Mentally I let up . But when he was beside me , my selfish , Totten attitude returned , and I poured it on all the way to the tape . " // Though Mills outleaned him , both were credited with a world record 27:11.6 . When a friend gushed , " I 'm so impressed that you broke that record , " Lindgren replied , " Well , I did n't like it much . It was an Elvis Presley . " Once he had used puns to parry derision . Now they deflected praise . // Lindgren 's great victories confirmed the lesson of his life . He became convinced that if he gave of himself wholly and perfectly , he must succeed . Not may succeed . Must . Guaranteed . " He was used to miracles , you know . " says his mother . // But the world seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Achilles tendon cost him the ' 68 Olympics . Then came Dare to Be Great . A concerned Walters got an accountant to sit down with Lindgren and discuss the ethics of selling franchises to sell franchises . " Gerry brought along a Turner man , " says Walters . " And it was an ugly meeting . Gerry and I were at a distance then . " // " He had a great knack for justifying what he wanted to do , " says Lindgren 's estranged wife , Betty . " He did n't like conflict . He would run from it . In a way , it 's simple . He never grew up . " // Lindgren had met Betty Caley at Washington State . " I did n't like him at first , " she says . " I thought he was a pest . " But she could sense his need . " He grows on you , T guess , " she says . " That goofy flirting . " They were married in 1970 , and had their first son , Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of the Munich Olympics , says Betty , " Gerry could n't make it back up to world class . He was constantly disappointed about it . " // They were a strange pair , a cockeyed optimist and a practical woman who could n't understand his striving and thrashing . " Everything was positive or negative , " she says . " He did n't see that he needed me to keep his feet on the ground , only that I was being negative . There was n't a thing we did n't look at differently . " // Betty put up with Gerry 's habitual flirting and his way of casually stringing together business trips . " Once he was supposed to be gone for a week , but ended up spending a month in Australia or New Zealand , " she says . " I got used to it , but I sure did n't tell anybody what he was doing . I liked being married to him . I liked being home with my kids . But it seemed sometimes that he was living a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family was in Oxnard , Calif. , where Gerry managed a Straw Hat Pizza restaurant . A second son , Jeremy , was born there . // " Then one day in 1976 , " says Betty , " he did n't come home . " // Some months earlier , Lindgren had been served with papers charging him with fathering another woman 's child . " I went to the Ventura Calif . County courthouse to read the complaint , " he says . " On the dates I was alleged to have gotten her pregnant , I had been in Japan . The prosecutor told me to forget it . " But the authorities soon came after him again . He treated it the way he had before . He stripped it from his consciousness . // The woman , Paulina Oseguera , had given birth to a daughter , Griselda , on Aug. 21 , 1975 . In fact , that was the only date listed in the complaint . On Dec. 14 , 1976 , upon Lindgren 's default , a judgment of paternity was entered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child support . But by then he had disappeared . // Efforts to reach Oseguera for this story were unavailing . But Lindgren says , " I never slept with her . I never met her . I was n't guilty . It was negative . I ignored it . I thought it was a joke . It was n't real . " He also says , " Even though it was not true , I was morbidly ashamed . I felt people would believe it . I could n't even tell my wife . " // A couple of months later Betty , who learned about the paternity suit secondhand , traced him to San Francisco through his contact with a running magazine , and they were reunited . Lindgren was contrite . He promised to do better . They moved to Tacoma , and he opened the Stinky Foot . // " We lived there four more years , had our daughter Mandy , and then he decided to go again , " says Betty . // Lindgren says that his marriage was crumbling . " Betty had gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her I should n't run anymore . I resisted that . " // " The kids loved him , " Betty says . " My deepest heartbreak is that my boys now 16 and 121 do n't know him . And even though his priorities were out of whack , I never asked him to stop running . " // The deciding factor , Lindgren says , was the long arm of the law . Washington 's Pierce County pursued him for the child support owed in California . He served 10 days in jail in 1978  --  he told Walters it was the most peaceful time he had had in years  --  but never submitted a blood test nor did he file a legal challenge to the California ruling . He did not have a lawyer . Predictably , his was a psyche quickly overwhelmed by contact with the judicial system . " I hate the idea of lawyers , " he says . " I have a complete lack of faith in the system . Here were all these horrible people with absolutely no interest in right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would have been easy to pay $75 a month , " he cries . " Betty said I was an idiot not to just live with it . But I could n't . I was n't made that way . " He was made to run . // In January 1980 , he took a bus to Los Angeles , where he provided himself , by means he will not discuss , with new ID in the name of Gale Young . " I did n't choose the name , " he says . " It just worked out that way . " // He brooded over abandoning his children . " I thought of the sadness of kids I 've seen , when their parents fight and fight , " he says , remembering his own childhood . " It was easier , in my mind , not to prolong things . " He had decided that it would be best if they grew up with one parent , and peace . // " I 'm sure Gerry figured the world would be better off without him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , kids and mom would be devastated , or his coach absolutely out of his mind with worry . I know his mom worried about him washing up on some beach . " // Oddly , Lindgren uses a similar image , but as a metaphor for a fresh start . " I 've always thought if I were dropped onto a desert island , I could learn the language , make myself useful and survive , " he says . " In this case , changing environments would be as simple as changing shoes . I had no joy in it , but I knew I could do it . I was n't running well , and people never paid any attention to me aside from my running . I did n't think for a minute it 'd cause hardships . " // Of course , it did . After his departure the store descended into bankruptcy . Betty Lindgren now works part-time at a dry cleaners and is a substitute teacher . Her children 's questions about why their father left remain unanswered . // Thus Lindgren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there had never been anyone but strangers . " One reason disappearing appealed to me , " he says , " was because he , Gerry Lindgren , the name , the image , was bigger than I was . His reputation had grown into a superhuman 's . " That was anathema . " To me , my name was ruined the first time I ran well . It was n't me anymore . " // He got on another bus in mid-1980 , woke up in downtown Houston and found a job at a Burger King . After a time , he says , he was a candidate for the store 's manager of the year . " My style was ' Be fast , not serious , ' " he says , with the old sparkle . He also says that while he was living in Houston he had a blood test , on the advice of a friend , and sent it , through channels , to Ventura County . Authorities there , however , say there is no record of such a test in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honolulu until late 1982 , though local observers swear they saw him earlier . He still bubbles about his first business . " A friend in L.A. made water-filled inner soles . I called them Hawaiian Happy Feet and sold ' em out of a cart by the International Marketplace . ' Are your feet sore ? Walk on water ! ' " Over the years , Lindgren worked at several other fast-food outlets and at Goodwill Industries . Lately , he has gotten into wholesale jewelry . He says it was little trouble to go unrecognized . " A few times people , reporters I guess , called about finding me . I just said they had the wrong number . " // A movie producer tracked him to Honolulu , hoping to include Lindgren in the making of Running Brave , Billy Mills 's film biography . " I never knew that , " says Lindgren . " Once a lady took my picture at Goodwill and sent it to my mom . That was the only real recognition . " // He moved frequently and left no forwarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them of his past . He covered his trail with fabrications , a fundamental irony for a man on record as believing so staunchly in truth . // In late 1983 , Dan Weaver , a reporter for The Spokesman-Review , located a young woman named Dolly who said she was Gale Young 's girlfriend . She said her boyfriend had left when she thought she was pregnant ; it had turned out she was n't . Dolly identified a picture of Lindgren as Gale Young . Lindgren swears she was not his girlfriend but the girlfriend of a roommate . // At about the same time , Walters went to Hawaii . " It haunted me to think of him alone , " the former coach says . " My quest is to sneak up behind him , and say I love him . " Walters patrolled Honolulu 's tracks and parks but never saw him . " I conceived of him as a victim of his coach , " Walters says . " I hear myself in his words . I did tell him to leave the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did n't remember the part about not being afraid to make mistakes and learn , to forgive yourself and go on . " // Always Lindgren ran , or tried to . Often his savage track workouts left him with strained thigh muscles . Clarke , a coach , marveled at his furious effort . " Occasionally someone would ask if he was the Gerry Lindgren , " says Clarke . " He used to deny it . But recently he 's said a soft little yes . I think the closer he gets to being able to compete well , the more willing he is to acknowledge who he is . " Running as identity . His first and best song . // It would not be Lindgren if his " exile , " as he terms it , were without its wacko touches . He called his mother once , to say he was all right . " But it was the middle of the night and he used such a strong Australian accent that it threw me off-balance , " she says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Eventually , some of that message seeped through . Lindgren began to wish to reclaim a few bits of his old life . When I called last fall , he was ready to take a run . When it became clear to me that he still revered Walters , I gave the coach his phone number . " I have chills hearing that he 's finally made contact , " Walters said . // Walters called Lindgren with an emotional outpouring of good wishes . " Oh coach , coach , " said Lindgren . " It 's such a relief to hear you . " At Walters ' urging , Lindgren said he would hire a lawyer to negotiate a settlement of the old child-support obligation , or , if possible with a blood test , to overturn it . " If he is innocent , " Walters says , " what a travesty it will have been . What a travesty if he 's not . " // Lindgren acted upon what must be everyone 's occasional , idyllic daydream : to cancel the past , to remake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that , a daydream . But once you know something of what led Lindgren to be the curiously crazed character he is , you know he has n't cancelled anything . His story is one of estrangement , of a man cut off , by his own hand , from self , from others . // And so the fundamental mystery persists . Is he suffering ? He appears not to be . He can speak of his interest in operating a restaurant catering to children without apparent regret that he has no contact with his own children . " Maybe he hurts so much that he can not bear to think of them , " says Walters , who hopes Lindgren is moving toward a reconciliation . But a letter that Betty sent in March to Lindgren 's current address was returned to her , unopened . // Lindgren 's exile may be delivering him into a kind of battered wisdom . " I live a very sedate , homebody life now , " he says . " I enjoy nature . I am without social or political activism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't matter . If I can eat well , and sleep , that 's enough . I do n't need a sea view and a big lawn . " // He reflects a moment . " If on my deathbed I can say I 've helped and given something , O.K. If I can only say I got it all for myself , that would be terrible . I 'd be dying in hell . " // Surely he will never escape his defining contradiction . He wants to do some service . Yet he wants to retreat from those he would serve . And by retreating , he may continue to wound . // Lindgren turned 41 in March and says he intends to race contemporaries Jim Ryun and Tracy Smith on the newly popular masters circuit . His first chance will come May 16 , in the Bud Light Legends Mile , on the same Eugene track where he held off Smith and sprinted into the spotlight 24 years ago . // " I 'd like to run , and run really well , to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice edging into the old song . " And maybe talk to kids afterward about how if they believe and work , they can do anything . And then ... then ideally I could go ' Poof .... ' " // He tosses up his hands , as if filling the air with magic smoke . " ... And be back in my secret , simple place . "
