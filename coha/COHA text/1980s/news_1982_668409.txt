A number of journalistic post-mortems on this year ' s moose hunt in Maine share a common theme . Sooner or later , the scribe gets around to discussing the dangerousness of the moose . Last week ' s Wall Street Journal has the most recent example of the assumption that there is some connection between the moose ' s personality and the hunting season . A quotation will illustrate : " The debate ( over the propriety of a moose season* centers on whether the almost tame , slow-moving and allegedly slow-witted animal is fair game . . .. A few people have told of being charged by a bull moose during the rutting , or mating , season , but such tales are hard to verify . " It is at least implied that if the moose were dangerous to human beings it would therefore be " fair game . " This is a very interesting line of thinking . A fair prize fight , for example , implies that both boxers are equally likely to suffer brain damage . The contestants are roughly matched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse shoe in his boxing glove . However , since the earliest man sharpened the end of long stick , there has been almost nothing resembling a fair contest between man and beast . The other factor in the reasoning process that leads journalists to calculate the dangerousness of the moose is the implied thought , if not hope , that an occasional moose will trample the odd hunter . We tend to root for the underdog , of course , and if the underdog can never win , we root to no purpose . People who suddenly realize they have been rooting to no purpose are likely to become very upset , as any number of promoters of boxing matches can attest . When it appears that one of the fighters has taken a dive , the mayhem outside the ring is usually worse than inside . There is a long tradition of emphasizing the character of the prey as an excuse for shooting it . The most famous person who played that tune was Ernest Hemingway . A large number of people who wouldn ' t read ten consecutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches of Hemingway in which he did in large numbers of big cats , buffalo and blue marlin . Actually , the most dangerous aspects of big game hunting and big game fishing are booze and sunshine . Booze leads to despondency and excessive sunshine to disfiguring skin diseases . Hemingway ' s last shot at fair game was that lonely night in Idaho . There are very few animals with pugnacious personalities , provided you haven ' t poked them with a sharp stick . Grizzly bears will evidently chew on people , but , unfortunately , grizzly bears chew on almost anything they find , from ants ' nests to elk . There is very little reason to assume that a killer bear is anything but hungry and no reason at all to assume it has a character disorder . If dangerousness were actually the test of whether or not there should be a hunting season , the only animal in North America that would meet the standards is the dairy bull . The excessive over-breeding of dairy cattle , the constant search for animals that can produce milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , has produced large placid cows who are in touch with themselves , and large angry bulls who are crazier than bedbugs . It must be the hormones . Every dairy farmer I have ever met has had a run-in with a dairy bull . And every dairy farmer I know can tell a story of someone in his county who was killed by a bull . These tales can be related with unusual accuracy as to the type of bull and time of day and other contributing circumstances . This is not because it happens all the time , but because you never forget it after you hear about it . Relationships between man and moose are never transactions - there is no give-and-take whether it is sight-seeing or gun- sighting . This is the nature of most encounters between man and beast , and all encounters between man and wildlife . There is certainly much reason to argue about the propriety of shooting moose , but it doesn ' t help much to argue about the equity of it . Equity between man and man is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
