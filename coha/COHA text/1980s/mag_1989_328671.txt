Something is abroad in the games people play , or about to go abroad , anyway . Suddenly the globe is ready to play ball , with the Soviet Union leading off . In their hearts , the Soviets probably still think they invented baseball , or lapta , an innocent steppes-child that supposedly predates both British rounders and Tommy John . But the bench jockeying has quieted considerably since the Reds dropped an April game to the U.S. Naval Academy , 21-1 , and their coach was heard to mutter , " Throw to second , not first . Second is the one in the middle . " <P> At the moment , Western sports pages are lousy with Soviets , who are lousy only at baseball . Three more hockey players from the vaunted Red Army team resigned their commissions last week . By the grace of a fresh understanding between Moscow and the National Hockey League , stars Vyacheslav Fetisov , Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov are now free to negotiate with the teams that drafted them : the New Jersey Devils , Vancouver Canucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only one Soviet applicant has felt the need to defect . Alexander Mogilny saw Buffalo and just could n't live anywhere else . Shrugging everything off , Soviet authorities have invited the Flames and the Washington Capitals to play a revolutionary series in Moscow and Leningrad come September . <P> In the tennis community too , freethinking Soviets are multiplying . Olga Morozova , the pig-tailed pioneer who occasionally popped into grand-slam finals during the ' 70s , now coaches a raft of promising young countrymen and - women known as the Glasnost Gang . The most precocious gangster is Natalia Zvereva , 18 , who is also the most perestroika-emboldened . She has won $515,000 professionally , but since much of it has been diverted into state coffers , she gripes , " I still do n't have enough money for a Mercedes . " When last seen , Zvereva was stomping back to the Kremlin to have it out with her agents . " If you do n't see me at the French Open , " she giggled in parting , " you 'll know what happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new picture . Cleared to participate in the next Olympics , the National Basketball Association plans to contribute one team to a Milan tournament in October and assign two others to open next season in Tokyo . Japan 's association with American baseball , of course , goes back to Babe Ruth . Just last November , on a typical All-Star tour , the Dodgers ' Orel Hershiser capped his nearly scoreless autumn by yielding a Ruthian homer to Fujio Tamura of the Nippon Ham Fighters ( " I was told he could n't hit a curve ball " ) . But Japan is importing all sports now , and the Los Angeles Rams will confront the San Francisco 49ers there in August . <P> The most daring development , as usual , is coming from the National Football League . Tex Schramm , the exiled general manager of the Dallas Cowboys , has been forming an international spring league that will announce its franchises any day now . " And they 'll be kicking off next April , " Schramm says . <P> Montreal and Mexico City will likely join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-game season leading to a summertime World Bowl . Towns tired of hoping for N.F.L. expansion franchises ( Jacksonville , Memphis , Oakland and Baltimore ) would seem the prime American candidates for the auxiliary league . London , Dublin , Frankfurt and Milan are among the European possibilities .
