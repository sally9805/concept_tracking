Old animosities fall away on a historic mission of mourning <P> There had been nothing quite like it in American history : three former Presidents sharing the cabin of an Air Force jet as they flew to the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Cairo . From talks with many of the dignitaries aboard the plane , TIME 'S Washington Contributing Editor Hugh Sidey put together the following account of their extraordinary mission of mourning . <P> <P> By mid-afternoon on the day of Sadat 's assassination , White House aides had decided that Ronald Reagan could not risk attending the services . The hazard to Vice President George Bush might be just as grave . Out of necessity came a unique act of national unity and historical significance : the launching of the plane of Presidents toward Cairo . <P> Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon had already signaled the White House that they wanted to attend the funeral . Reagan decided to make it a full house . White House staffers tracked down Gerald Ford in New York , and he eagerly signed on . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult job of selecting the rest of the official party and assigning the 52 seats for guests and crew on board SAM ( for Special Air Missions ) 26000 . ( The code name Air Force One is reserved to any Air Force plane with the incumbent President aboard . ) The aircraft was the same Boeing 707 on which Lyndon Johnson was sworn in , and which carried the body of John Kennedy from Dallas to Washington , D.C. Pleas for space came in by the dozens , including one from <P> Plains , Ga. , for Rosalynn Carter . Wives had initially not been invited , but Rosalynn felt so strongly about Sadat that the Carters said they would travel to Cairo on their own if there was no space for her . A seat for Rosalynn was set aside . There was also one for 14-year-old Sam Brown , of Liberty , S.C. , who had written a touching letter to Sadat . <P> The Air Force dispatched two Jet-Stars and a C-9 transport to gather the Presidents .

Secretary of State Alexander Haig was official leader of the party , so he got the " Presidential Suite " on board 26000 ( " The diplomatic way out , " joked Haig ) . Irony flashed through the minds of the arrangers . Two cabins behind Haig would ride Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , for whom Haig had worked as a lesser aide . Such is the span of fleeting power . <P> First behind Haig 's suite came the lounge assigned to staff . The Presidents came next in a cabin with two tables . Nixon and Ford were placed side by side facing Kissinger and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger . On the other side of the aisle were the Carters and Mr. and Mrs. Ashraf Ghorbal . Egypt 's wise Ambassador to the U.S. was heading home on the most somber journey he had ever undertaken . In other seats were military and diplomatic dignitaries , Senators and Congressmen and a three-man press pool . <P> They came together for their flight late Thursday afternoon . Canzeri made certain that the Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared a helicopter to the White House for Reagan 's eloquent farewell .
