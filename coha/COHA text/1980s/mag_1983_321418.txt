ATTACKING HEART ATTACKS <P> A single aspirin a day can help keep heart attacks away for hundreds of thousands of Americans , according to a striking new report from the Veterans Administration . The study involved 1,266 male patients suffering from unstable angina , an extremely painful condition that is often a harbinger of heart attacks . About half the men ( 625 ) took one dose of aspirin daily in the form of an Alka-Seltzer solution ( used because it is less upsetting to the stomach than plain aspirin ) . The other patients were given a fizzy placebo . <P> At the end of twelve weeks , the rate of both heart attack and mortality was 51 % lower among aspirin users than among the group taking placebos . Though aspirin is thought to interfere with potentially dangerous clotting of blood , earlier tests showed it to be of limited help to patients who have already had a heart attack . The new data , however , clearly demonstrate that small doses are very effective in preventing heart attacks in people who have had the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANCER <P> Three years ago , researchers announced the discovery of human genes that were capable of turning ordinary cells into malignant ones . The news met with some skepticism . Experts asked how a single gene could cause such a dramatic change . Why does cancer take years or even decades to develop if it is caused by such a simple and direct process ? In last week 's issue of the British journal Nature , three research teams answered those questions by setting forth a new model for understanding the role of oncogenes in cancer . <P> Each group found that it does in fact take more than a single cancer gene to produce cancer in normal cells . Teams at M.i.T. and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island , N.Y. , reported that they could induce cancer in normal rat cells only by inserting at least two types of oncogenes into the cells . " A single oncogene produced some changes , but not cancer , " explained Molecular Biologist Robert Weinberg of M.I.T. " It took two genes acting cooperatively to produce a tumor . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> A British team confirmed the multi-step cancer scenario by showing that a particular oncogene caused a tumor in hamster cells only if they had first been exposed to a carcinogenic chemical . The chemical alone and the oncogene alone did not cause cancer ; both were necessary . While the discovery has no immediate implication for treatment of cancer , it helps explain why the disease develops slowly and why its incidence rises with age . " Even if one part of the process occurs , " says Weinberg , " you might not have the second step for another 20 years . "
