 | MANY YEARS AGO , when I was a boy in the Deep South , the family often used to sit out in the yard in the evening . The adults sat on canvas lawn chairs and talked ; the children lay on the grass , listened , and watched the stars come out . Once each evening a single airplane passed over , its pale lights flickering . Now and then relatives would come back from far-off places for a visit . I can remember meeting them at the railroad station : the silent platform , a distant throbbing , the sudden and splendid appearance of the locomotive . With a whoosh of steam , the great train would be beside us , relatives descending . Those who came back from " up North , " from New York City , I remember , were always changed : They spoke differently , dressed differently , even their faces were somehow changed . And the things they had seen ! The stories they could tell ! And then they were gone again , on the same silver rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there arose the image of not just one unglimpsed but near-mythic city , Jerusalem , the city of God , but also the image of a second , New York , the city of human possibilities . When recently I was able to spend time in that great city myself , I was forewarned that I had come too late . " Shudda been here in the ' 40s , " one man said . " Ai n't the same . " I wondered . " HI YA , FATHER . " " Hi , Eddie . " " Hi ya , Father . " " How ya doing , Rita ? " I was walking down West 42nd Street  | with Father Robert Rappleyea , pastor of Holy Cross Church . The parish reaches from Broadway and Times Square to the Hudson River , and from 36th to 46th Streets . The church is 113 years old . It has seen the coming of the great immigrant tides , the flourishing of breweries , granaries , slaughterhouses , the bustle of rail yards and docks ? all now vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . I had read about this part of Manhattan , and wondered what was happening now . " For a time , " Father Rappleyea said , " it seemed it could all go under . In the past four years things have been turning around . " He pointed out the problems he and others had been combating : Peep shows , bars , adult bookstores , prostitution , drug dealers ' hangouts , hard characters , abandoned buildings , tourist hotels converted into residences for discharged mental patients . " Some , " he sighed , " are nightmares . " But the signs of renewal were clear . A block of old buildings , once part of a tenderloin district , had been converted into small off-Broadway theaters and a restaurant . A second block was being similarly revitalized . The city , the state , the federal government , foundations , banks , and nonprofit corporations had joined hands to rejuvenate 42nd Street . Their plans included a revived Times Square with a new 292-million-dollar hotel , a great pedestrian plaza , even a trolley line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . There were other signs : On the small side streets old buildings and houses , laced with fire escapes , were being bought and restored by young people who wanted to live in the heart of the city . And there was Manhattan Plaza , two 45-story apartment towers between Ninth and Tenth Avenues . The complex had been built to house upwardly mobile , two-income  | families , but by the time it was completed , rising costs had driven rents out of reach of the intended market . A Manhattan-type solution was found . The towers became federally subsidized housing , with 70 percent of the units set aside for performing artists with limited incomes . " A great asset , " Father Rappleyea said . " You have 3,500 people , shops , cafes , a swim club . You have people coming , going at all times ? most young , with the future in mind . " There was another reason for the comeback . We stopped by the Poseidon Bakery on Ninth Avenue . The store was redolent of Greek pastries baked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their three sons lived over the store . " People tend to forget , " Lili said , " that this has traditionally been a family neighborhood . Things began to deteriorate about 12 years ago ; five years ago was the worst . It was the prostitution . " Then people began to become part of block associations , began to call the police , began to realize they had to get involved . We had many rallies : schools , business people , the Broadway theater people . We had a huge stage built right on Times Square . " The city began to be aware that there was a community here that cared . They set up a police substation on Times Square and assigned more police to the street at night . Things are 80 percent better . " Families like the Fables worked in other ways to improve the neighborhood . When they finally got a small park on 46th Street . an outside gang took it over . The neighborhood boys drove them out . " There must have been 300 kids racing from block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police cars and ambulances . Now during the day , if there 's enough of our kids coming , its OK . In the late afternoon , we lose it to outsiders . " The struggle was far from over , but Lill gave no thought to leaving the city . " It 's the greatest place in all the world ? and the boys , they do n't talk about moving to the country any more . " When I last saw Father Rappleyea , some months later , he said , " If you have a moment , stop by and see the church . " I did . Inside were the familiar statues , burning candles , a handful of petitioners . But there was something new : The interior glistened and smelled of fresh paint . Holy Cross , like the old neighborhood , was freshening up . I LIVED FOR A TIME in an old hotel at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street . All day long there was the trump of blasting as workmen gouged into the Manhattan schist to lay foundations for new skyscrapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : twelve under construction , two more planned , sixteen under consideration . They included six hotels , a residential tower over the Museum of Modern Art , a corporate headquarters for AT &T,; an office building for IBM . So dense was planned construction between 39th and @#  | 60th Streets that some Manhattanites organized to resist it , saying the towers would cut off the last of the sunlight . Nevertheless , the towers symbolize both le city 's economic gains in the past four ears and the shape of the future . The gains were largely confined to Manhattan . They lay in the areas of finance , banking , national and international corporations , and all the businesses that serve them , in tourism , and in movement back to the center of the city by middle-class and high-income people . Manhattan , it seemed , was shaping itself even more into a society of the knowledgeable , the talented , the affluent . Among the developers building the skyscrapers is Donald Trump , 34 , president of the Trump Organization . Donald 's father had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boroughs ; Donald had moved to midtown . " It 's incredible , " he said . " Five years ago New York was in trouble ; today it 's the hottest city in the world . Every block somebody 's fixing , restoring , building something . Look at the West Side ? it 's a boomtown ! Young people are coming back to the city , and new shops and restaurants are following right along . " Donald 's company was restoring the exterior of Grand Central Terminal ; stripping the old Commodore Hotel down to its frame and rebuilding it as a hundred-milliondollar Grand Hyatt Hotel ; promoting the sale to the state of a 750,000-square-foot site on 34th Street for a 375-million-dollar convention center . But his proudest achievement was on Fifth Avenue . He had paid ten million dollars for the old Bonwit Teller building there . In its place will rise Trump Tower , a 150-million-dollar , 68-story goliath . " I 'm a young guy , " Donald told me , " but I 'll never be able to get another site like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Tiffany 's . " The building 's lower floors would be devoted to shops and offices ; the upper floors to apartments . Base price : $500,000 . Who would live there ? Those with a taste for Luciano Pavarotti at the Metropolitan Opera , for Mikhail Baryshnikov of the American Ballet Theatre ; for museums like the Metropolitan , the Guggenheim , the Whitney ; for art galleries and auction houses ; for shops like Tiffany 's ; for the yeast that comes from mixing young Greenwich Village film-makers with Columbia University scholars , and those on the way up with those on the way down . In short , for what only a great city can provide . Manhattan 's economic gains had been bolstered by an influx of foreign money ; in the process , it was becoming more and more an international city . Foreigners were buying apartments for personal use , real estate for investment , old-line companies for profits . Gimbels , Saks Fifth Avenue , the New York Post , even the great toy store F.A.O . Schwarz now sail under foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Swiss hands . The flow of overseas money could be measured by the number of branches and agencies of foreign banks : Five years ago there were 96 ; today 170 , with combined assets of 138 billion dollars . Foreign companies have also been busy establishing offices here . The Japanese alone have 480 corporations in the city . Specialty businesses have arisen to cater to their executives , among them sushi restaurants and another Ginza favorite , the piano bar . THE JAPANESE PIANO BAR was just off Park Avenue . A long cabinet held patrons ' bottles , almost all expensive Scotch . My Japanese friend and I were seated by the mamma-san and joined  | by two hostesses . One girl was from Japan ; she wore the traditional kimono and white face powder . The other was from Oregon , a hopeful actress . While we talked , Japanese businessmen took turns at the microphone beside the piano . They sang old Japanese songs , recalling their faraway homeland : " When the wind blows , the leaves turn silver .... " When one finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The piano bar , the songs , the effort to sing them properly seemed to restore each man , reconnecting him with his heritage . As we left , my Japanese friend and I passed a small plaza . On each of its concrete benches lay a sleeping form , bundled against the chill night . Farther along we saw flattened boxes leaning against the side door of a church . A hand reached out and adjusted a piece of cardboard . If there is a touch of Tokyo in Manhattan , there is also a hint of Bombay , the sleeping forms in the streets . THE CITY HAS CHANGED , of course ; the numbers collected by economists and the census tell you that . From 1950 to 1969 , New York remained stable in jobs and population , the unrivaled metropolis of the nation . In ' 69 came the break . National trends caught up with the city : the shift to the suburbs and the Sunbelt , gains in communications and transportation that made a central location less important , the decline of central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500,000 jobs , mainly in manufacturing , and 825,000 people . Financial crisis followed . The present city administration does not expect to regain that lost population or most of those jobs . It has cut its suit for a smaller city . The city work force has been chopped by 60,000  | services have been curtailed , schools and libraries judged redundant closed . For two years the city budget , now carefully audited , has been in balance . And this year , for the first time since 1975 , the city sold some long-term bonds on its own ? without using the special system set up with state and federal help . " There will be problems down the road , " one banker told me , " but we 've turned around . We 're back from the precipice . " AMONG THE INDUSTRIES affected by these changes are the proud designer shops and dress manufacturers of Manhattan 's Seventh Avenue . They still dominate the nation 's styles and sales , but regional markets and imports now challenge them , and they have lost a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . I boarded the freight elevator at 41 Elizabeth Street in Chinatown and rode up to Eddie Leung 's shop on the fourth floor . Eddie was in his office , a small man with a high voice , a garment contractor for 22 years . When Eddie had started out , there were 15 shops in Chinatown ; now there were 475 , employing 15,000 people . Eddie explained : " China has begun to let people out ; many come here , a new source of labor . So manufacturers uptown may bankroll bright young men here who can set up and run shops . " We walked out into the sewing room . " All immigrants , " Eddie said above the hammering of the machines . " Most are from south China , Canton . Maybe a girl here says she wants to bring her family over . I promise jobs . When they come , the girl and I teach them together . They send a lot of money back to the homeland . " The increased immigration has brought problems as well as payrolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protection rackets , shootings , drugs , charges of sweatshops . Some Chinese are moving away to avoid these . Still , Chinatown grows , spreading into Little Italy , which is declining as its younger people move out . All over the city , ethnic patterns are shifting as people come and go . City Hall plots it all on a great map , a dazzling kaleidoscope of reds , blues , greens , purples , chartreuses , oranges , browns , blacks , grays . I asked the man in charge of the map about immigration today . " Seventy-three thousand legal immigrants into the city each year , perhaps as many more illegally . They come these days mainly from the Dominican Republic , Italy , China , Jamaica , Ecuador , Colombia , Cuba , the U.S.S.R. , Trinidad and Tobago , Greece , India , the United Kingdom , Guyana , Korea , Haiti , and the Philippines . As they tend to live together , they also tend to seek the same jobs : Koreans are strong in fresh-fruit and vegetable markets ; Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic mix flavors and enriches the city , and the newcorners provide willing hands for jobs others may spurn . SLOWLY , DAY BY DAY , Manhattan began to yield some secrets . The horse-drawn carriage swung past the Mall , the one great formal space in Central Park designed long ago for promenades . " This stand of elms , " Betsy Barlow said , " and a stand in East Hampton are among the finest left in America . See the overreachmg , arching limbs , like a cathedral . " Betsy scanned the trees for " flagging , " the yellowing of leaves that signals Dutch elm disease . Betsy is administrator of the park and spends time looking for private , state , and federal funds to maintain its natural amenities ; the city does not have enough money . Private funds were found to combat the Dutch elm disease , state funds to resod the battered Sheep Meadow . The pounding of millions of feet alone did damage . A concert was scheduled that eveping ; 200,000 would attend . There would be wear and tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflict on the park . For one festival , I had learned , people used to come into the park the night before , dig holes , roast pigs . On the day of the festi-val itself , things became so frenetic that by 3 p.m. police concentrated only on heading off violence or injury , and made little attempt to control gambling , drinking , drugs . The carriage clattered on : past the Bethesda Terrace and down by the model-boat basin , where we bought ice-cream cones . Then to the boathouse by the lake . Birdwatchers keep a log there of sightings in the nearby Ramble . Betsy , herself a bird-watcher , wanted to see what had been spot-ted that week . She read aloud : " Yellow warbler . Northern water thrush . Baltimore oriole ? two young ; one took its first flight . "  | In Central Park , as throughout Manhattan , I was learning , you can find what you want : quietude or frenzy . Last year 71 feature films were photographed in New York City . Little wonder : Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jugglers , mimes , peddlers , actors , gamblers abound ? the last , three card monte men who carry cardboard boxes to serve as tables . They set up anywhere ; everybody knows it 's a sucker 's game , yet many of them play . It is a city of images glimpsed : the spider web of Brooklyn Bridge cables , aglow in the setting sun ; the black beards and hats of the Hasidic Jews on 47th Street , diamond cap ital of the nation ; burly meat-packers on the Lower West Side taking a break in blood smeared smocks ; yellow cabs fighting the traffic up Eighth Avenue , like salmon strug gling upriver to spawn . I spent an evening with four chamber musicians in a nook at the Hallmark Cards store on Fifth Avenue . They were out of work for the summer and needed money . A small crowd collected ; people came and went . " Any Vivaldi ? " one woman asked , dropping a quarter into their box . " Turn that off ! " demanded a young rogue . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elegant couple on roller skates paused , skated on . Around the corner a man selected another Hallmark nook , lay down on the sidewalk , and went to sleep . " It 's like Dickens , " said Chris , one of the musicians . " I like Dickens . Maybe that 's why I like New York . " So do I , I thought , so do I. Few days lacked a surprise . I bought a newspaper at a sidewalk kiosk . " Got your morning Times , eh , " observed a well dressed woman nearby . " Well , stick it in your ear ! " I smiled and scurried on , never to learn the source of her feelings . It 's an outspoken town . One Sunday morning I was walking with Mayor Edward Koch in Greenwich Village , his neighborhood , discussing his achievements so far . His Honor was saying that his administration had begun to reverse the ill wind that had shaken the city , that the middle class now had a friend at City Hall , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sophisticate , and that he wanted to be mayor for three terms ? " it will take that long to clean up this place . " A garbage truck passed ; the worker on the back yelled , " Hi ya , Mayor ! " " Hi ya , " the mayor shot back . " How 'm I doing ? " " You 're doing great , keep it up , " the worker shouted . The truck rattled on . TIME and again the theme of change reappeared . Roseland ballroom on West 52nd Street ; Wednesday night . The $12 ticket entitles you to a free buffet and the ceaseless music of two big bands . I made my way past display cases holding the dancing shoes of the great and once great ? Joan Crawford , Fred Astaire , Paul Hartman ? and found a table . Charlotte was a widow from Flushing . She raised her finger to chin level . " When I get up to here with the house , I come . Everybody in New York knows Roseland . It 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types . I try to dance only two dances with any one man . " Abby was retired and lived in an apartment house in the West 80s . " My room used to be a maid 's room , but the super enlarged it by making a little more space in the hall for me . It 's small , but it 's a bargain , and I got safety ? two doormen in the lobby all the time . " Abby too was a regular . The bands played " Star Dust , " " Begin the Beguine , " " Spanish Eyes " as a tango . As we moved across the dance floor , beneath the 333  | glittering chandeliers and streamers , it seemed in time as if we were all on some great cruise ship slipping away from Manhattan , away from lonely rooms . Charlotte and Abby departed separately , Cinderella-like , before 11 ; then Roseland transformed itself into a disco , catering to a younger crowd , moving with the times . THE POLICE OFFICER was tall and Irish , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , I knew your father-in-law , " he told my companion . " Had a jewelry shop , did n't he , upon 106th ? I was walking a beat then . Things were different then . If someone was harassing a merchant , we 'd go sit in the back of the store with a beer and wait for the guy to come around again . When he did , we 'd take him out and do a number on him . He would n't come back . It was efficient ; no court . " The officer thumped the papers on his desk . The station house was air-conditioned , fortlike ; the streets outside humid , alien . One day , talking with a Broadway mogul , I mentioned that the theater now seemed to lack an O'Neill , an Odets . " Look , " he said matter-of-factly , " nothing is what it was ; nobody is what he was ; not me , not you . They wrote in a certain time about certain problems and are remembered for their contributions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and problems in a world that is very different . So we have a Pinter , a Neil Simon , an Albee . Today more people are going to the Broadway theater and spending more money than at any time in its history . In that way , the theater is better off . Times change , you adapt , and the bottom line is always in economic terms . " I spent 24 hours with Ladder Company Three down on 13th Street . In the morning we inspected buildings ; in the late afternoon  | the alarms began . We rushed to a great department store ; no fire , an alarm malfunction . The assembled firemen put their oxygen tanks , axes , and hoses back on the trucks with relief ; two had died in such a building the week before . Through the night we leaped from our beds and roared through empty streets ? a woman reported a tenement on fire ( it proved to be a charcoal grill on a fire escape ) ; a woman reported smelling smoke in her apartment ( a neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of smoke ( nothing found ) . In time the dark buildings , with their sleeping populations , took on a sinister look : A fireman could die in any of them . With morning we rushed to Union Square to extinguish a trash fire near a subway entrance . And now we sat , tired , coffee in hand , in the station house . I asked a couple of the men what changes they had noticed in the city in recent years . Two shrugged their shoulders . One replied : " It 's a year older . " MORNINGS : Sometimes a yellowbrown haze , sometimes a metallic gray haze . Sometimes a sharpness of light and shadow that takes your breath . and you can smell the sea and see clear down the island . On such a day I headed down to Wall Street . I sought not change but abidingness . I was reassured when I met Bob Enslein , a member of the New York Stock Exchange , in the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club . There were wood-paneled walls , mounted moose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | counter , a small room where members checked their street shoes and slipped into more comfortable shoes for the long hours of trading . We went down into the pit . The day was typical : An opening " bulge , " a midday lull , a closing bulge ; 45 million shares traded . Between buys and sells , Bob talked . " A few years ago we considered a new building . This floor was a reflection of the 1920s . We needed tons of electronic gear to computerize and provide instant communication for the emerging national market system . A new building proved too costly ; we decided to rebuild the inside of this one , without stopping trading . " Thirty-nine million dollars later , the floor has been rebuilt , its new trading posts festooned with blinking electronic boxes . Thus the venerable New York Stock Exchange building , symbol of American capitalism for nearly a century , endures ? thanks to the careful measuring of a dollar . " THE PROBLEM with New York City , " a deputy mayor told me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Manhattan south of 96th Street , which is doing great , and all the rest . " I headed uptown . On 103rd Street , between Third and Lexington Avenues , a stool sits on the sidewalk . On the stool is a large goldfish bowl , filled with water and covered by a piece of cardboard with a slot cut in it . The bottom of the bowl holds a saucer . If you can drop a coin through the slot so that it drops into the saucer , you win money . Though surrounded by coins , the saucer remains empty . In a way , the fishbowl symbolizes East Harlem , Spanish Harlem , the heart of the Puerto Rican population in Manhattan . Few other parts of Manhattan have greater unemployment or social distress . * Father Javier Irurtia pulled a bottle of brandy from the cupboard in the rectory of @# Holy Agony Church and filled two glasses . The brandy , like the priest , was from Spain . " This is a ghetto from which people want only to escape . The moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Many think always of retirement , of returning to Puerto Rico . Even people in their 40s . " So , as in the South Bronx across the Harlem River , people were moving out , leaving blocks pocked by abandoned and burnedout buildings , littered lots , broken dreams . Some fought back . I met Maria on 103rd Street , by the vacant lots she wanted to turn into a playground . She had grown up across the street ; she remembered when the lots held a supermarket , houses , a synagogue . She had earned dimes turning out the lights for the last . Now she was a social worker . The kids she supervised , paid by several agencies , scraped away at the rubble . She and the kids had written to the owners of the lots , asking that titles be transferred to the city ; to foundations , asking for money for playground equipment ; and to politiasking for support . Now they awaited the replies . Maria was angry : Despair was too often her neighbor . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think , we have five senses just like everybody else . We have people here who need jobs , and you look around and you see all the work that needs to be done , but nothing happens . " TENEMENT WINDOWS indicate life or abandonment on 103rd Street . Bricks and sheet metal close the windows of abandoned buildings , like pennies on a dead man 's eyes . In the windows of occupied buildings you will glimpse a wooden birdcage , a flowerpot , pillows propped in  | the sun , an old man staring , a child reaching through the metal grill . I entered the tenement at 156 with Anna Salazar . " I 've finally gotten people to use a key , to keep this outside door locked for their own protection . Now you can walk in and up the stairs without being afraid of anyone being behind you . " We went up five flights , and out on the roof . " You can see the destruction , " Anna said . The buildings on both sides had been burned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is abandoned , she said , sometimes people go in them and set fires ? to cook , to keep warm , perhaps to burn . " I 've pulled this building out of abandonment twice , " Anna said . " I 've lived here almost 35 years . Thirty-five years ago it was beautiful . Like little private homes . " I asked Anna when she had taken over the building last . " About a year and a half ago . The landlord was n't paying his taxes and he was n't paying his utilities . They were going to turn off electricity for the common areas . The landlord owed them $17,000 . That got me all fired up . " So I organized this building . I held back my rent to show the other people they should n't be frightened . " We went to court , " Anna continued , " and we signed a petition . Article 7-A of the state 's real property act . As a matter of fact , you can take over and act as the landlord . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . " Anna had more plans . In her apartment she showed me an architect 's drawing . A local community group had applied for federal assistance to rehabilitate 15 buildings . The 117 apartments defined in the architect 's plan would again be like little private homes . " I just keep plugging along , " she said . " But how long can I do it ? " @# ON ONE OF MY LAST NIGHTS in Manhattan , I went to Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center . Leonard Bernstein was returning to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra as guest conductor . The concert ended with a profoundly moving rendering of a Mahler symphony . The audience rose to its feet . A woman in my row shouted : " Atta way , Lenny , sock it to ' em : " Sock it to whom , I wondered . Life , perhaps ? Never mind ; that combativeness , that willingness to engage is as much a part of Manhattan as the great music , the great buildings , perhaps its essence . I departed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Jersey flats . Looking back , I could see the towers of Manhattan poking above the bluffs along the river . It was an image very much like the one I had fashioned so long ago . The larger city , I knew now , had changed : It had lost jobs , people , financial resources ; for many . the human possibilities had narrowed . Yet in one sense New York had not changed . With Manhattan as its heart , it remains the greatest of cities , capable of inspiring wonder . Here as in ancient Rome , a poet could truly write : " Nothing human is alien to me . " I remembered talking with an investment banker in an office above Rockefeller Center . He had grown up in Paris , lived now on the Upper East Side , traveled often on busi-ness to London and Paris . " Manhattan , " he had said , " is the only place in the world to live . The only place that 's really civilized in the sense of the 1980s . Maybe not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter part of the 20th century ? in terms of the intellect and the arts , in science , in the sense of what 's good and bad in the world ? is here .
