That ' s how she likes it . That ' s how her husband of three years likes it , too. // " He says we should keep a low profile , " Mrs. Trump said recently. // That ' s rather difficult when you ' re part of the news-making Trump family , when your husband is executive vice president of the Trump organization , when you socialize with New York ' s partygoing set and when the attentions of the paparazzi spark rumors of a cool relationship with Donald ' s wife , Ivana. // Blaine Trump is upset by those rumors , maintaining that the family is close . She and Ivana have been observed laughing over lunch at Le Cirque , and the two couples are often together at social functions. // Mrs. Trump ' s desire to keep a low profile stems in part from spending her adolescence in Japan , where her father worked for I.B.M. She was a typical Southern girl , having grown up in South Carolina , Florida and Alabama . But in Japan , where she lived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blondness and height made her a curiosity. // " I was 5 feet 9 inches tall when I was 12 years old , " she said with a grimace , " and the other kids always made fun of my big feet. " // A low profile is out of the question this week , when Mrs. Trump steps into the spotlight as the chairwoman of tonight ' s salute to Christian Lacroix by Bergdorf Goodman at the World Financial Center , and as a co-chairman of tomorrow night ' s " An Evening of Magic " at the Waldorf-Astoria to benefit Lenox Hill Hospital. // After the back-to-back galas , she said , she will return to her roles of wife and mother . " Robert said , ' I hope you ' re not doing any more of these anytime soon , ' " she said. // But Robert also said , to quote his wife , who quotes him all the time : " You have to help your friends , and your friends help you. " // That is how her involvement with the two parties came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beige-and-peach living room ( in a Trump building , of course ) on the 36th floor in midtown Manhattan . Although her chair was heaped with cushions , she sat the way she stands , the well-bred way of a woman who attended finishing schools in Switzerland and France : back straight , head held high . She wore beige pants with a matching turtleneck , an emerald-cut diamond ring of modest size , a simple watch and fake tortoise-shell earrings. // " We went to a wedding last May , " she said , " and Jim McMullen , who ' s a good friend , was sitting at the same table . Toward the end of the night , he asked me to co-chair the Lenox Hill benefit with him . I said , ' No ! No ! No ! ' And he said , ' It ' s really important to me . ' So I looked at Robert and he said , ' This is a tough one.

' And Robert said , ' I guess you ' re going to do it. ' " // Mrs. Trump and Mr. McMullen have worked as a team on the Lenox Hill benefit . " She calls me every morning at 8 , " he said , " and tells me what she thought of at 2 in the morning . I ' m going to miss those calls. " // What came out of their talks was a decision that the party should attract younger people ( Mrs. Trump admits to being in her early 30 ' s ) , without offending the stalwarts who have supported the benefit for 50 years . The pair set a goal of 600 tickets ; they sold 950. // Tonight ' s party will be be held in the unfinished World Financial Center at Battery Park City , far from the usual haunts of the Mortimer ' s set . A showing of Mr. Lacroix ' s famous poufs in the marble courtyard will be followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid 45-foot-tall palm trees. // When Bergdorf ' s approached her in midsummer , Mrs. Trump said , " I told them I couldn ' t do both parties , but then Robert said I could get it all over with for the season . " She also felt a commitment to the evening ' s beneficiary , the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , where her grandmother had been a patient. // Explaining the choice of Mrs. Trump as a chairwoman , Dawn Mello , Bergdorf ' s president , said , " She possesses the charm that represents Lacroix ' s style , but she turned out to be an incredibly hard worker. " // Arnold Scaasi said : " Some people may think she ' s too sweet , but I like her . You can talk straight to her , and she ' ll come back with an honest answer . " He recalled saying to her once : " You ' re getting to be like Mary Tyler Moore - I ' ve never heard anything bad about her either . There must be something wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t all family and parties . She also works at a part-time paying job , checking in new acquisitions for the Christie ' s auction house . Indeed , she met Robert Trump at a Christie ' s fund-raiser. // " I try to keep that world separate and private , " she said . " I sign everything ' Miss Blaine ' or ' Blaine Beard , ' my maiden name . I once signed a receipt ' Blaine Trump ' and the man wanted me to send my husband to visit his bathroom fixture showroom. " // Her full name is Martha ( after a grandmother ) Lindley ( for a great-great aunt ) Blaine ( a great-great grandfather ) Beard . " I ' ve always been called Blaine , " she said . " I never liked Martha. " // Even her weekends are fairly private . " You never hear from us , " she said . " Robert and I both love to go to the movies . Robert rates theaters on the quality of the popcorn . We get our popcorn fix and rev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president of Yves Saint Laurent of America , said that when she calls the couple on Sunday night , they ' re usually in bed , watching television with Christopher , Mrs. Trump ' s 9-year-old son from her previous marriage. // During the week they rarely go out more than three nights . " When we don ' t have a social commitment , " Mrs. Trump said , " we almost always stay home or meet another couple for dinner at Jim McMullen ' s restaurant. " // Marriage has its moments , however . According to Ms. Henderiks , when Mrs. Trump ' s younger sister , Jean Otey Beard Barden , comes to visit , the two speak Japanese . " Robert goes absolutely wild , " Ms. Henderiks said. // Although Mrs. Trump ' s closets hold clothes by all the top American designers ( " Living in Japan made me very patriotic " ) , she said she hates to shop . " I was so happy when Carolyne Roehm went into business , " she said . " We ' re the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . So I just call and tell her what I need. " // Mrs. Trump plans to wear a Carolyne Roehm dress of pink satin to the Lenox Hill party . She asked Mr. Lacroix to make a dress for tonight ' s event . She refused to describe it , however , saying , " It was a surprise to me , and it ' s going to be a surprise to everyone else. " // Whatever she wears , she ' s certain to be the delight of the paparazzi . Mr. Scaasi said he told her : " Now it ' s your turn , and you have to accept it . By next year there ' ll be someone else. " //
