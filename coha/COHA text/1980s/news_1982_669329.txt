The occasion was last weekend ' s two-day ' ' Fete de l ' Humanite , ' ' the carnival organized here every year by the French Communist Party . That the party could put on such a massive affair with such high attendance shows how strong and imbedded the party remains in French society. // But the festival only masked profound problems facing the party . In many ways , French Communists are on the defensive , isolated and divided. // This might seem odd for a party that came to power in 1981 in France ' s first leftist government in more than two decades . As the junior partner in President Francois Mitterrand ' s Socialist-dominated coalition , though , the Communists are facing a dilemma. // The party wants to show it can help govern responsibly . But that means supporting a government that has made fighting inflation and increasing faltering industrial investment more of a priority than easing the plight of the country ' s 2 million plus unemployed. // Even before it entered the government , the Communist Party was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the vote in the 1981 election. // The decline forced the Communists to relinquish to the Socialists the dominant position in the French left that they have held for most of the postwar era , and accept the junior role in the Socialist-led government . There are only four Communist ministers in Mr. Mitterrand ' s government , and they hold such relatively low-profile posts as transportation and health. // Today , polls show that the party ' s share of the vote would fall to 12 percent if elections were held now . This further reduced role was illustrated by the attitude of many who attended the festival. // ' ' I am not a militant , ' ' one young man said , echoing the statements of many others who were enjoying the sunshine and music . ' ' I came to have a good time. ' ' // While this working-class youth might very well have been an active Communist a few years back , he now says the French Communist Party no longer relates to his needs. // ' ' I am not looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many political analysts , this sentiment illustrates the party ' s problems . Its doctrinaire approach has become outdated in an increasingly modern France. // Unlike fellow Italian and Spanish Communists who have embraced an ill-defined ' ' Eurocommunism , ' ' the French party under Georges Marchais has stuck to a pro-Soviet line , refusing to condemn Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and martial law in Poland. // At the same time , while other European parties have become more flexible and less vitriolic in defining their communism , the French Communists have remained firmly tied to overthrowing the entire capitalist system . This point of view does not sit well with many workers who have become better off during France ' s rapid post-World War II industrialization. // Mr. Marchais has also retained the principle of ' ' democratic centralism , ' ' requiring members to accept the leadership ' s decisions without question. // This centralism , internally and externally , has splintered the party . Several thousand dissidents have left the party and are publishing a weekly journal , Rencontres Communistes , that demands more democracy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally decided it was time to dissociate ourselves from the authoritarian , secret practices that have come to characterize the party , ' ' Henri Fiszbin , Rencontres Communistes ' leader , told the Monitor . ' ' The party is unable to take a stand independent of the Soviet Union. ' ' // All the same , Fiszbin and his followers refused to join the Socialist Party . ' ' The history of France reveals that workers ' movements have always had their political opinions expressed by the Communist Party , ' ' Fiszbin explained. // To be sure , the French Communist Party is firmly rooted in French history . It benefited from its undeniably courageous resistance record during the Nazi occupation . Through the 1940s and ' 50s , it maintained a distinct image amid the political fragmentation and factionalism of the Fourth Republic. // While the Socialist Party struggled to shed its reputation as a Parisian parlor reformer , the Communists earned high marks as honest , efficient administrators responsive to local needs , and provided a sense of ' ' belonging ' ' for their working-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitterrand , the Socialists have succeeded in painting themselves as much more reasonable than the Communists . As a result , they have attracted millions of votes away from the Communists , reversing the balance of power on the left. // But one can not write off the Communists . They continue to hold tremendous power in the trade unions through their domination of France ' s largest union , the Confederation Generale du Travail ( CGT ) . // It was this power that forced Mr. Mitterrand to include the Communists in his government . He preferred to keep the party safely under his wing rather than see it wreck Socialist rule with a series of strikes. // For the most part this strategy has worked so far . The Communists have been loyal partners , rarely raising their profile to criticize the government. // Recently , though , the Communists have begun to distance themselves somewhat from the Socialists as France ' s economic difficulties have increased . Mr. Marchais pointedly criticized the government for imposing a wage freeze. // But Mr. Marchais is not ready to pull his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fete de l ' Humanite , he reaffirmed his support in general for the government ' s austerity program. // ' ' No one can honestly deny that the new majority elected in 1981 has a positive balance sheet , ' ' he said . This statement echoed the recent restrained language of Henry Krasucki , the Communist secretary-general of the CGT , who has refrained from calling for strikes because of the government ' s wage freeze. // Observers say the Communists will not stay tamed and tied up forever in a minor role in the government . The success of Mitterrand ' s government may depend on the result of a possible Socialist-Communist split. // //
