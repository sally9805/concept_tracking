Gulf + Western slims down <P> Charles Bluhdorn was one of the earliest and flashiest corporate conglomerateurs , a master of the unfriendly takeover . Starting with a small auto-parts company in 1958 , he assembled an incredible array of disparate businesses into Gulf &; Western Industries ( 1982 sales : $5.3 billion ) . Bluhdorn eventually bought some 100 companies large and small , ranging from Paramount Pictures to publisher Simon &; Schuster to New York City 's Madison Square Garden . In one six-year period , he brought 80 firms into what became jokingly known as " Engulf and Devour . " Bluhdorn died in February at 56 after a heart attack , and his successors are in no mood to keep up that pace . They are contracting Gulf &; Western almost as fast as Bluhdorn expanded it . <P> Last week the new management team headed by Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Martin Davis , 56 , announced a major streamlining program to rid the company of low-profit operations . Among the cast-off candidates : Arlington Park race track near Chicago and Roosevelt Raceway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's video-game-making unit . The moves would save the company about $470 million in tax write offs , but produce a loss of $215 million this year . <P> The divestitures were just the latest ordered by Davis , who went to Gulf * Western from Paramount in 1969 and took over immediately after Bluhdorn 's death . Davis had earlier moved to sell off $650 million of company-owned stock in 30 companies , leaving the conglomerate with some $150 million in such holdings . The money was used to bring down the company 's mountain of debt to $1.2 billion . Davis then also sold Gulf + Western 's 21.4% stake in Brunswick , the sports-equipment manufacturer , for $97 million . <P> Davis has likewise chopped away at the company 's work force , reducing it by about 10,000 , to 47,000 . Two weeks ago , 35 managers were dropped . An earlier casualty was David Judelson , Gulf &; Western 's president , who was passed over for Bluhdorn 's job and resigned . Judelson had overseen the disastrous multimillion-dollar investment in developing batteries for an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dimmed . <P> Gulf * Western officials believe that Bluhdorn would have approved the breaking up of the empire he built . Says Executive Vice President Neil Call : " He would be concerned about how fast we 're doing it . " Bluhdorn sensed that the conglomerate had got out of control and sold Brown , a paper-products firm , insurer Providence Capitol and cement producer Marquette . Davis completed the sale of Consolidated Cigar for $120 million . <P> Pointless mixing of dissimilar firms now seems finished at Gulf &; Western . Says Shearson/American Express Analyst Scott Merlis : " Few of their businesses were related to their other businesses . " Instead , the company now seems determined to focus sharply on a few areas : consumer products ( apparel , Kayser-Roth ; home furnishings , Simmons ) , entertainment ( Paramount ) and financial services ( Associates Corp. )
