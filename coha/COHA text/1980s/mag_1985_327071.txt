The attack was carefully timed and meticulously planned . Shortly after midnight under a full moon , small-arms fire began to crackle around the Kampuchean refugee camp and guerrilla base known as Ampil , hard by the border with Thailand . The shooting eventually died away , only to be replaced , just after sunrise , by a thunderous artillery barrage . Plumes of smoke rose from the dusty thatch-and- bamboo compound as heavy Vietnamese guns poured thousands of rounds into the area  --  " a huge rumbling , " as one witness described it , " an explosion not every minute but every second . " A dozen Soviet-built T-54 tanks and nearly two dozen armored personnel carriers added to the cacophony as they nosed into battle ahead of some 4,000 Vietnamese infantrymen . <P> Unnerved by the concentration of firepower , many of Ampil 's 5,000 defenders , all members of the anti-Communist Khmer People 's National Liberation Front ( K.P.N.L.F. ) , broke and ran . Some managed to regroup for counterattacks , but eventually most of the lightly armed guerrillas scrambled to safety across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vietnamese had mopped up all significant resistance at Ampil , in the process sending small detachments of regular troops across the ill- defined Thai border . At one point , a Vietnamese officer walked up to a Thai army checkpoint to inquire where the frontier was . During a brief argument , a Thai sergeant said , " If you fire at us , we 'll fire back . " Replied the Vietnamese , " If you fire at us , we 'll invade Thailand . " In the end , the Vietnamese pulled back into Kampuchea after being warned that the Thai government would " take action . " Thai soldiers set out orange sticks marking the frontier , and the two forces agreed to establish a 22-yd. demilitarized zone on each side of the line . <P> So ended the latest phase of the annual dry-season effort by Hanoi to stamp out forces opposed to the Kampuchean regime of Heng Samrin , who is widely considered to be a Vietnamese puppet . From Hanoi 's point of view , the operation was a success : between 89 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Vietnamese casualties were presumed to be much lighter . Moreover , the attack dealt a blow to the Khmer Front , the major non-Communist element in the close to 60,000-member guerrilla coalition that is continuing to resist the 1978 Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea . <P> The Vietnamese launched the initial phase of their offensive in November , and on Christmas Day attacked Rithysen , the biggest of eight Khmer Front guerrilla bases that dot the Kampuchean side of the border . The Christmas onslaught drove some 62,000 civilian refugees into Thailand ; the threat to Ampil added 23,000 more . Many of the guerrillas are expected to filter back into Kampuchea , but the Vietnamese have made public statements indicating that they intend a permanent occupation of the border region , depriving the guerrillas of their comfortable zone of sanctuary . If the K.P.N.L.F. intends to fight on , it will probably have to abandon static defenses in favor of more classic guerrilla tactics , dispersing its strength and moving deeper into the Kampuchean countryside . Said one analyst in Thailand : " If you 're going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed bodies of civilians . "
