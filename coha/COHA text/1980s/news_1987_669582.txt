A baldish , round-faced man with ruddy cheeks , Mr. Fitzwater was chosen three months ago by former chief of staff Donald Regan to replace longtime spokesman Larry Speakes , who left to take a job with Merrill Lynch . But unlike some Regan-appointed aides who are now on their way out of the White House , Fitzwater got a nod of approval from his new boss , chief of staff Baker. // The White House press corps is relieved. // // ' ' He has lightened the atmosphere , ' ' says Helen Thomas , the veteran correspondent with United Press International . ' ' He ' s balanced and reasonable . When you put a question to him , he thinks about it , and he isn ' t hostile and confrontational. ' ' // ' ' He ' s doing a fine job , ' ' remarks CBS correspondent Bill Plante . ' ' He ' s handled difficult questions forthrightly , and he hasn ' t tried some of the more lubricious forms of evasion. ' ' // Ellen Hume of the Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Speakes ever did . He ' s known for being fair , and he handles himself professionally. ' ' // The job of chief White House spokesman , who tells the world what a president does , says , and thinks , is difficult under the best of circumstances . It is fraught with political and diplomatic mine fields when a president is fighting for his political life because of a scandal . A White House spokesman has to impart accurate information ( if he can get it ) and be careful not to mislead the press , while protecting the president from damaging statements and putting the best light possible on his actions and policies. // Fitzwater brings to the job 20 years of experience as a government press officer and speech writer . He is a native of Kansas who worked as a reporter while studying journalism , and he began his government career at the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965 . Early in the Reagan administration he served as a public affairs aide at the Treasury Department. // Later he became deputy to Mr. Speakes and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Even with this background , Fitzwater is being forced to be a quick learner , absorbing as much as he can on everything from the tangled events of the Iran-contra operations to the intricacies of arms control . It is a hectic , demanding exercise. // ' ' I like my job , ' ' says Fitzwater after two months of genial combat with the press . ' ' It forces an intellectual exercise in a way I ' ve never had before . The challenge to learn about issues in a fast and thorough way is greater than I ever anticipated. ' ' // At this point the challenge is still one of finding out himself what is going on at the White House and keeping a jump ahead of the reporters. // ' ' I have to know more than I talk about , ' ' he remarks . ' ' It ' s like running down an alley on every issue - you know you will get to the end and you will have to say , ' I don ' t know any more . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It remains to be seen how closely clued in to the Oval Office and how influential Fitzwater will be . After a shaky start , Speakes ultimately got fairly high marks on this score . But to the relief of the horde of journalists covering the White House on a daily basis , Fitzwater has appreciably changed the circuslike atmosphere in the West Wing briefing room. // Larry Speakes thrived on verbal repartee and confrontation . His style was combative , and the daily briefings resembled theater more than the kind of professional briefings given at the State Department . Speakes fed a show-biz atmosphere in which he and reporters often ended up exchanging insults as well as witticisms . It was not , of course , a style discouraged by Speakes ' s superiors. // ' ' All the personal sniping and attacks have stopped , ' ' says ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson . ' ' He does not call us names and we do not call him names . . . . When I talk to Marlin , he clearly wants to be helpful , and doesn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor. ' ' // With the Iran-contra affair still threatening , the White House naturally has an interest in lowering the level of conflict and tension with the press . ' ' That ' s the reason they picked Fitzwater , ' ' says Martha Kumar , a communications expert at Towson State University . ' ' By the end of an administration they do not find any value in fighting with the press and the President tends to withdraw more. ' ' // If the sharp edge is gone , the humor is not - a quality essential to surviving briefing-room pressures . Rare is the session that passes without some levity . After Howard Baker moved into the White House , for instance , Fitzwater told reporters Mr. Baker would require no wholesale firings or requests for resignations and that he , Fitzwater , would be allowed to stay. // Reporter : ' ' So you have the job , is that it ? I mean , you have the job permanently ? ' ' // Fitzwater : ' ' He said I would be staying , yes. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Laughter. ) // Fitzwater : ' ' It may be his first lapse in judgment. ' ' // Print reporters are especially pleased with the change . It was Speakes ' s style to play to the television correspondents , who have assigned seats in front . ' ' When you deal with what our target audience is , it ' s the dozen or so people who are most influential in the White House briefing room , ' ' he told the Monitor in 1985 . ' ' Clearly that ' s the network and major newspapers in Washington . . . because that ' s where people get their information. ' ' // Fitzwater is careful not to criticize his predecessor , but from the start he has set a practice of calling on journalists in the back rows as well as the front . ' ' Everyone has a right to ask a question , ' ' he says . ' ' The half-a-million-dollar stars are in the front row , and I ' ll see that they get their questions answered , but I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // He has also opened his office door to reporters , who in the past were frustrated by limited access and unanswered telephone calls . ' ' Marlin ' s more dedicated to openness , ' ' says Mr. Donaldson . ' ' But ( the lack of it ) was not all Speakes ' s fault - he took with him a policy that Don Regan put in place. ' ' // How much access does Fitzwater have to President Reagan , an access that measures how much he really knows ? // ' ' In terms of how he manages , I ' m as close as I need to be , ' ' Fitzwater says . ' ' Jody Powell under Carter had the closest access , but it didn ' t mean better information because of that . I ' m very pleased with my access and conversations . He calls me , he watches the news - and suggests when there ' s a better way to say things. ' ' // But in terms of his relationship with the press , Fitzwater indicates , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does see the President. // Judging from his performance to date , Fitzwater will not seek the television limelight . He is in fact acutely conscious of the power of the medium and how it can distort the meaning of words . He says that several months ago he was asked to go on TV with a quotation that appeared in a newspaper . He refused. // ' ' With print the words are there , and I have to consider that the reader believes them and makes an interpretation , ' ' he says . ' ' But on television I have to consider the story line , my face , and the narrator ' s presentation . Those issues are far more important than the words. ' ' // //
