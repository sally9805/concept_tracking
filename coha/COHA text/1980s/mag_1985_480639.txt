Crime is a social problem ; in a sense it is the social problem , because it breaks the bond of trust that makes society possible . But that 's about as far as the consensus on the subject goes . On March 3 , for example , the Justice Department released a study showing that 40 percent of the people who entered state prisons in 1979 were on probation or parole for previous crimes ? and thus would not have been free to commit new crimes had they served full terms for their earlier ones . The following day , the Eisenhower Foundation issued a report denying the efficacy of punishing criminals and urging that public policy address the " real " causes of crime , such as high unemployment among minority youth . These two reports neatly illustrate the philosophical dispute that runs through the debate about crime . If our actions are a product of causes outside our control , then it is unfair ? and ineffective ? to blame criminals for what is really the fault of society , or their parents , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and use punishment solely as a means of rehabilitation . If our actions are freely chosen , howDavid Kelley is the author of The Evidence of the Senses , a philosophical work on perception . ever , then society can hold us responsible for them and refuse to indulge the kinds of excuses that determinism offers . Punishing wrongdoers is then a form of retribution , and a way of removing them from our midst . For more than a decade , the public has been moving steadily into the free will camp . Outrage over the trial of John Hinckley led Congress to tighten the insanity defense . Earlier , in the 1960s , the sight of social theorists fiddling with determinism while the cities burned helped elect Richard Nixon on a law-and-order platform . The crime rate , despite a recent dip , is well above the level of two decades ago and remains high on the list of public anxieties . Politicians across the spectrum have long since learned the electoral advantages of being ( or seeming to be ) tough on crime , and on criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , where the goal is to explain criminal behavior . The most powerful models of explanation we have are drawn from the physical sciences . The social sciences have not abandoned the hope of finding laws that govern human action in the way that the law of gravity governs the motion of a stone ; and journalists who set out to explain particular crimes , to get behind the " story , " arc drawn ineluctably into the search for causes . But the search always runs into problems , problems that arise from the very assumption that criminal behavior is solely a product of causes beyond the criminal 's control . Thus to solve the social problem of crime , we must first confront a philosophical one . We need to acknowledge the inadequacy of determinism . The first 610 pages of Joe McGinniss 's Fatal who has never confessed to the crime ; the second is a mass of psychiatric testimony , along with McGinniss 's own speculations , as to why and how MacDonald could have committed so brutal a crime . Though the psychological account has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac , Donald was a hardworking , dedicated , and ( to all appearances ) compassionate doctor . But he had an intense desire to control others and showed great hostility toward anyone who stood in his way , or even disagreed with him . He was remarkably unperceptive about his own behavior , and in several haunting scenes in the book ? as when he worries about which uniform he should wear to meet the press after be- ing cleared of murder charges by the military ? he reveals an incredible poverty of feeling . McGinniss caught MacDonald in a number of lies , many of them serving no ostensible purpose . And despite MacDonald 's protestations that his marriage was happy , he had had a series of casual affairs , apparently fueled by worries about his masculinity . MacDonald had no history of violence . But if , on the night of the murder , he and his wife had an argument ( there is seine evidence that they did , and that their relationship had grown increasingly tense in the preceding months ) ; and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her usual passive role ; and if MacDonald saw her as a threat to his masculinity , to his very sense of self ( defined as it was by his ability to control others ) ; and if , having worked for thirty-six hours straight , he was unable to exert his normal control over his feelings ? if all this was so , then perhaps we can begin to understand the murder ( of his wife , at least ) as a form of self-defense . On page 610 , however , we are given another explanation , a physiological one : MacDonald had been taking diet pills containing amphetamines . McGinniss conjectures that MacDonald took the pills in doses larger than he has admitted ? doses large enough , according to the medical literature , to cause psychosis , hallucinations , and delusions of persecution . Yet neither the psychological nor the physiological explanation of the crime is very satisfying ? not , at least , if we are looking for causal explanations . Psychology tends to explain an action by reference to underlying beliefs and goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make an action intelligible . If MacDonald believed that his wife was challenging his authority , and if his goal was to avoid such challenges at all costs , then the act of removing the threat follows by a kind of brutal logic . Often , an explanation of this sort is enough . But in the case of a murder it is not . The violent destruction of one 's wife and children is not only awful and repellent ; it wears its awful and repellent character on its face , visible to anyone not wholly deranged . For most of us , the enormity of such an act would function as a kind of barrier reef : the rides of personality would crash against it and rebound , shaking loose the grip of whatever desires had tempted us . So we turn with relief to the diet pill hypothesis , not only because it is clear and simple but because it gives us a real cause , one that might have compelled MacDonald to act . No one , after all , chooses the way his neurons react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for we have purchased causal necessity at the cost of intelligibility . We do not yet understand why orthe natural ally of determinism . Science , after all , trades in causal explanations . Immanuel Kant , two centuries ago , argued that the scientific perspective leads inevitably to determinism , that freedom could be defended only by opposing the authority of science . In Walden Two , R. F. Skinner claimed that the increasing success of a science of behavior would make determinism more and more plausible . But the progress of science has not borne out Skinner 's prediction . The problem is not that scientists have n't discovered any causal influences on human behavior . The problem is that they have found too many . No category of human action has been studied in as much depth , or from as many angles , as crime . Here is some of what we have learned from that inquiry : q Young males are disproportionately responsible for crimes of violence and property crimes . The Baby Boom partly explains the massive rise in crime from the early 1960s to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the country , the murder rate in those years went up ten times faster than demographic changes alone would have led one to predict . q Psychologists have found that criminals tend to fall outside the normal range on a number of personality traits . These include some we might expect , such as disrespect for authority and diminished capacity for empathy . But among them are also such unexpected traits as hyperactivity and slower response to aversive stimuli . q There is a link between poverty and crime , but it is a complex one . Crime rates are higher in poor areas than in wealthy ones ( for violent crimes , at least ) , and poor people are more likely to be arrested and convicted . But the rates are higher in urban slums than in rural areas of equal poverty , and they vary widely among ethnic groups of the same economic status ; poverty per se may not be the crucial variable . There is also some evidence that crime rates fluctuate in accordance with the business cycle , suggesting a correlation , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delinquents are much more likely to have been abused as children than nondelinquents. 1=l The incidence of alcoholism ? and , especially since the 1960s , of drug use ? is much greater among criminals than among the population at large . There is also some evidence that about a third of all serious crimes are committed by people under the influence . q When a criminal has a twin , that twin is at least twice as likely to he a criminal himself if he is an identical rather than a fraternal twin . And among adopted children who commit crimes , the biological parents are more likely to be criminals than the adoptive parents . This criminological sampler , brief as it is , shows that no single factor is sufficient to explain criminal behavior . This should not come as a surprise : no social scientist expects to find a single explanation for any human action . It is precisely the job of theory to explain how various causal influences interact . But this raises another , deeper problem . The factors mentioned above are of diverse types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is far from clear how one should go about explaining the interaction of causes at such different levels . The existing theories typically solve this problem by denying it . A good example is E. H. Sutherland 's theory of " differential association , " which evolved through the ten editions of Criminology , by Sutherland and D. R. Cressey ( Sutherland , who died in 1950 , published the first edition in 1924 ; the tenth edition was published in 1978 ) . This theory is still perhaps the best known in the field . Sutherland and Cressey hold that criminal behavior is determined by one 's participation in a number of gfoups : family , school , neighborhood clique . We tend to adopt the attitudes of groups we belong to , in proportion to the strength of our ties to these groups . We are all pulled in different directions by competing attitudes toward criminal behavior , by different " definitions " ( to use Sutherland 's term ) of the law as something to be respected or flouted . Thus " a person becomes delinquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law over definitions unfavorable to violation of law " among the groups he belongs to . The theory of differential association can take into account a number of factors relevant to crime , but only those having to do with social conditions . The theory is essentially a form of environmental determinism , based on the samemodel of causality as Skinner 's behaviorism . To maintain such a reductionist , " single-level " explanation of human action , any causes that are not social must be explained away . If there is a link between alcohol and criminal violence , for example , Sutherland and Cressey suggest that perhaps the offenders have " learned from associations with others certain ways of acting when intoxicated . " There may actually be something to this It is very difficult to reproduce in the laboratory the types of behavior that alcohol induces ; social setting does seem to he a factor . But it is a sign of sociological desperation to claim that it is the only causal factor . In some cases , at least , the criminal 's intent seems to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerving himself for the act . It is also likely that alcohol use and crime are related effects of underlying psychological causes . And what of the effect of alcohol on the brain Another example : Many social scientists would explain the fact that males commit a higher proportion of violent crimes than females by treating gender as something purely social . Social norms encourage violence in boys , discourage it in girls . That is surely part of the explanation . It is just as surely not the whole explanation ; gender is a physiological as well as a social condition . As Melvin Konner points out in The Tangled Wing , studies with animals have shown that testosterone levels during key periods in maturation affect the degree of aggressiveness in adults . And an increase in testosterone lowers the threshold of firing in a nerve bundle called the stria tenninalis , which is part of a neural circuit known to be involved in violent behavior . Or consider the appalling incidence of child abuse in the families of delinquents . Dorothy Otnow Lewis and her associates divided the youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the severity of their crimes . As she reports in Vulnerabilities to Delinquency , 75 percent of the more violent offenders had been abused as children , as against 33 percent of the less violent . And 79 percent of the first group ( compared with 20 percent of the second ) had witnessed extreme violence : they had seen their mothers slashed , their siblings burned with cigarettes . It would be hard to find more compelling evidence that one 's environment can have devastating effects . But it is likely that the violent behavior of these youths flowed from physiological as well as emotional damage they suffered as children . Virtually all of the more violent offenders had neurological disorders , and 30 percent of them ( as against none of the less violent offenders ) had grossly abnormal electroencephalograms and/or histories of grand mal seizures . Environmental determinists are aware that between the stimulus and the response lies a very complicated piece of equipment ? the human organism . But they regard the internal properties of that organism as mere " intervening variables , " to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stream of environmental forces . The Tangled Wing is an exhaustive demonstration that this view is false . Pulling together evidence from genetics , biochemistry , ethology , and neurophysiology , Konner shows that the intervening variables are in fact the controlling ones . An animal 's genetic endowment determines which stimuli it can respond to and the kinds of responses those stimuli are most likely to elicit . Even among humans , action flows in large part from emotions that have their origins in the interplay of hormones and neural structures that were shaped by selection pressures over the course of a million years . This is not to say , of course , that the environment is irrelevant , merely that environmental determinism is as narrow and simple-minded as genetic determinism . As Konner writes , " Any analysis of the causes of human nature that tends to ignore either the genes or the environmental factors may safely be discarded . " But such ecumenism has a cost that Konner does not fully appreciate . The evolution of the nervous system , from the simplest reflex arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interposing longer and more complex loops between stimulus and response . As control of behavior moves inward , action replaces reaction , the organism becomes an agent , and we have to consider the possibility that the whole is more than the sum of its parts . Despite its sophistication , The Tangled Wing is still reductionist , filled with confidence that a scientific understanding of the parts will add up to an understanding of the whole . " When we have characterized the biology of moods , " Konner suggests , in one of many such statements , " we will have characterized the major forces behind behavior . " But the riches that await us in biological research , and doubtless they are many , will leave Konner 's account of human behavior overdrawn , his confidence in reductionism insufficiently funded by the evidence . Indeed , a number of prominent biologists , such as Nobel Prize winner Roger Sperry , have concluded that behavior will never be understood fully at the neuronal or biochemical level ; and they have revived the view that qualitatively new and irreducible properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the human brain , the massive expansion of the frontal lobes made possible two traits that have always seemed to distinguish man from other animals : the capacities for self-awareness and for abstract , conceptual thought . Konner has almost nothing to say about these capacities , or about the fact that they enable us to modify and override the more primitive responses of evolutionarily older parts of the brain . Yet if Sperry and his allies are correct , these capacities are examples of " emergent " properties beyond the reach of any reductionist explanation . The only hope of understanding them lies in a more holistic approach , one that crosses the mind-body divide and examines them as traits of a conscious self . The result of such an examination could be merely a more complex deterministic account of human action . But it could also be that the capacities for conceptual thought and self-awareness represent an evolutionary change of kind , not merely degree . They do not , of course , break the bonds of determinism altogether : we are still constrained by our genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our social environment . But if the human agent , the self , is more than the sum of its parts , then our actions may be more than the sum of their antecedents ; we may have room to maneuver within the causal net . procity . It was as if a human intelligence had been planted in the brain of an innocently predatory animal . The psychologists called these individuals " moral imbeciles . " The classic clinical portrait of the psychopath was drawn by Hervey Cleckley , who was a therapist in private practice , in Mask of Sanity ; some researchers still use his list of sixteen traits as a diagnostic tool . Cleckley 's subjects exhibited the normal range of intelligence ; many were well informed , many were talented . They were not delusional , and seemed entirely free of anxiety . Yet they seemed unable to learn from experience , making the same mistakes over and over , even after they had recognized them . His subjects were chronic liars , even when no clear gain was involved . Cleckley came to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he studied them more closely , he was struck by the concreteness and fragmentation of their thinking , reflected in their complete lack of interest in long-range planning for their lives . Most of his patients , especially those with criminal records , were able to size up people quickly ; they were good at manipulating others and mimicking conventional feelings and attitudes when it served their purposes . Yet at other times their actions revealed an inability to anticipate how others would react . ( One woman , in applying for jobs , routinely gave as references people whose trust she had repeatedly violated . ) Cleckley was most struck by the poverty of feeling these people exhibited . Primitive emotions ? spite , vanity , sentimental affection , flashes of violent anger ? came and went like New England weather , but there was no indication that they experienced deeper , more complex emotions , such as grief , pride , joy , despair , or love . His patients were often witty , but never revealed any genuine sense of humor . Their egocentricity was so profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite their indifference to the suffering they caused others , their obliviousness to moral standards , and their incapacity for feeling shame , humiliation , or regret , they were quick to blame others and to defend themselves when criticized . Moral evaluation mattered to them in a way that belied the appearance of amorality . Cleckley 's patients were not all criminals , nor do all criminals fit the pattern he described.The degree of overlap is hard to estimate . Researchers using the Minnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory have found that prison inmates score well above the general population on the " psychopathic deviate " scale ; however , that scale is a fairly cnide measure . The psychopath is perhaps best seen as a prow-type to which criminals conform more or less closely . Any doubts about the existence of a link between crime and psychopathy have been dispelled by the work of Stanton Samenow and Samuel Yochelson , who conducted a fifteen-year study of criminals at St. Elizabeths Hospital , a federal psychiatric facility in Washington , D.C. Their two-volume work , The Crimincd Personality ( summarized in Sainenow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clinical portrait remarkably similar to Cleckley 's . Yochelson and Samenow found the same concreteness in thinking that others have noticed . Their patients ' short attention spans made it next to impossible for them to take a long-range view of their lives . They rarely learned from experience . Their non-integrative cognitive style made it difficult for them to see any contradiction between their violent , predatory behavior and the sentimentality they often expressed toward the helpless . The career criminals Yochelson and Samenow studied tended to view " straight " life as a series of concrete acts , most of them boring . These people lived in the moment , and did not see the value of the longterm rewards of a family or a career . These cognitive traits have a common root : an anti-conceptual mode of thinking . For it is the power to conceptualize that makes us able to act on principles , to think in terms of long-range goals , and to learn from experience . The psychopathic syndrome also involves a certain self-conception . The psychopath was traditionally considered less susceptible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the basis for one explanation of the syndrome : psychopaths ' insensitivity to punishment hinders the process of socialization . In the course of their interviews , however , Yochelson and Samenow. found their subjects to he intensely fearful . Their greatest fear , Yochelson and Samenow found , was that of " the zero state . " This sense of complete and profound worthlessness was something all of their patients had experienced , and went to great lengths to repress . They protected themselves against it by a kind of grandiosity , a conception of themselves as supermen , as effortless heroes able to achieve great ends by unconventional means . Their chief method of sustaining this self-image was to exert control over others . By forcing others to bend to his will ? intimidating them , manipulating them through lies and cons ? the psychopath makes society affirm a view of his potency that he can not affirm by looking within . Conversely , anything that suggests a lack of control over the world threatens to bring on the zero stare . According to Samenow , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he wo n't achieve unusual distinction , the chance that things will not go as he wants constitute a major threat to the criminal , almost as though his life were at stake . From his standpoint it is , because the puncturing of his inflated self-concept is psychological homicide . " Anyone trying to understand the case of Jeffrey MacDonald should find that a chilling observation . Theories about the causes of psychopathylike those about the causes of crime ? are numerous and varied . Most if not all of the traits of the psychopath have been observed in people with neurological damage . And it is hard to believe that neural damage had nothing to do with the violent behavior of the delinquents studied by Dorothy Otnow Lewis . But as the eminent neurologist Frank A. Elliott has noted , " organic disorders tend to produce a ' partial ' psychopath rather than the fully fledged classical picture . " There are also sociological explanations . In Criminal Violence , Criminal Justice , Charles Silberman describes the brutality of crimes committed by juvenile delinquents , often without remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so brutalized in their own upbringing . " More generally , he suggests that crime usually springs from an impoverished self-conception , caused in turn by economic poverty : In a society that rewards success and penalizes failure . . . to be poor is to live with continual self-doubt . " But this can not be the whole story , unless we assume ? and the assumption is often made by social scientists , ally without benefit of evidence ? that the individual derives his self-esteem exclusively from the responses of others . That assumption leaves no way to account for the fact that people differ in precisely this respect : the autonomy of their self-estimates . Cleckley , for his part , held that psychopathy is a deeply rooted disorder , an abnormality more profound even than schizophrenia . Though the psychopath presents a mask of sanity to the world , his actions reveal that the mask " disguises something quite different within , concealing behind a perfect mimicry of normal emotion , fine intelligence , and social responsibility a grossly disabled personality . " Yochelson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , in patterns of thinking that are accessible to consciousness and ? with some effort ? subject to conscious control . They have discovered , for example , a phenomenon they call " cutoff , " a severe form of anti-conceptual thinking that allows someone on the threshold of committing a crime to blank out all of his fears and doubts . This act of blanking out is voluntary : " Even though cutoff is so rapid and automatic , it is still a mental process that is under the criminal 's control . Whether he invokes the cutoff is his choice . " As evidence of volition , they note that criminals learn nor to shut off their fears ton soon , lest they dull themselves to signs of danger . By the time of Yochelson 's death in 1976 , thirteen of the thirty patients in the special therapeutic program at St. Elizabeths were leading responsible lives ? a major achievement , given the dismal record of criminal rehabilitation , and a sign that patterns of thinking are amenable to change . The agent of change , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient learn to monitor his thoughts and to prevent his fragile self-image from blocking out his awareness of what he has done , of who he is . Yochelson and Samenow came to believe that crime is a voluntary act for which the criminal is fully accountable . This is not , to say the least , the majority view in criminology , but it is not surprising that they adopted it . For in tracing the roots of crime to problems in the criminal 's ability to think conceptually and to form a self-conception , they arrived at the two uniquely human traits to which anti-determinists in all fields have always appealed . he conflict between free will and determinism first arose in philosophy , and most of the philosophical arguments for human freedom have been variations on a common theme . Because we are capable of self-consciousness , it is claimed , we can focus attention on an impulse or feeling and examine it from a kind of inner distance that can weaken its aura or grip . Because we are capable of conceptual thought , we can evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on others , their compatibility with our principles ? and choose whether to act on them . We are free agents because those capacities give us veto power over the forces that move us . Determinists have always found this argument naive : science . they say , will show that behavior is governed by causes beyond the reach of conceptual thought and self-awareness . But in the case of crime , at any rate , the trail of scientific inquiry keeps circling back to those very capacities . It would be too much to say that science can establish human freedom . That will always be a philosophical issue . But the old assumption that science is a witness against free will is not true , either ? it will not survive a close look at what scientists have actually discovered . Human beings have turned out to be far more complicated than the sciences of man anticipated . We may just turn out to be as complicated as we always thought .                  @ @ @
