U monists who are counting on " industrial policy " to save their industries and their jobs would be advised to examine how well the Chrysler bailout has achieved its " public goals " and how it has affected the labor movement . The United Automobile Workers , which has come up with its own version of industrial policy ( as have the machinists and the A.F.L. -C I.O. ) , points with pride to the bail-out as an example of the cooperation between business , labor and government that is a key feature of most industrial policy proposals . " It 's a success story worth proclaiming to the mountaintops , " said the union newsletter , " Washington Report . " In the same issue , Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca was nominated as " our latest candidate for folk hero . " Another view was expressed by Pete Kelly , president of U.A.W. Local 160 and a veteran leader of the union 's militant faction : " If the U.A.W. saved 43,000 jobs at Chrysler , they were the most expensive 43,000 jobs the labor movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by labor ? Let 's briefly look at the terms of the bail-out agreement and at the $1.1 billion worth of concessions the union made as its part of the bargain . During contract negotiations in November 1979 , U.A.W. representatives told Chrysler management that the union would accept $203 million less than it received from Ford and General Motors . At that time Congress was discussing a $1.5 billion bail-out plan for Chrysler , and the union expected it would be asked to make concessions . To the union 's chagrin , Congress demanded an additional $243 million in union cuts as the price for passing the Chrysler Corp . Loan Guarantee Act . The U.A.W. agreed : the concessions were necessary to get the loan guarantees , and the loan guarantees were necessary to insure Chrysler 's survival . In December 1979 , the bill was passed ; one year later , Chrysler went back to the government for a third installment of loan guarantees . This time the U.A.W. agreed to $622 million worth of pay and benefit cuts , including a pay cut of $1.15 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour than their counterparts at G.M. and Ford . To justify spending public money to aid a private corporation , the bill 's proponents argued that it would serve " public purposes . " The cost of a Chrysler shutdown , they Jane Slaughter is the author of Concessions ? And How To Beat Them ( Labor Notes , P.O. Box 2001 , Detroit , Michigan 48220 ) . said , in terms of unemployment and welfare benefits , would be much greater than the cost of the loan guarantees . Former U.A.W. president Douglas Fraser was fond of saying that the bill was not a corporate bail-out bill but a ) ( lips bill It was also argued that a Chrysler bankruptcy would , , , devastating to blacks and to the city of Detroit . In 1979. blacks made up 28.6 percent of Chrysler 's U.S. blue-collar work force . And twenty-two of its thirty-nine plants were located in the metropolitan Detroit area . But the bail-out was in tended to enable Chrysler to " down-size " ? to restructure itself and make itself more efficient so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rationale , it was inevitable that Chrysler would close its oldest plants first . Most of those were in Detroit , where most of the company 's black employees lived and worked . At the end of 1979 , 22,674 blacks worked for Chrysler in the United States ( this was down from a peak of 35,868 in 1977 ) . By the end of 1982 , black employment at the company had fallen to 14,046 ? a decline of 38 percent in three years . In 1980 Chrysler received a $150 million loan from the State of Michigan . How did the company repay its benefactor ? Twenty Chrysler plants in the United States have been closed . Sixteen of those were in the Detroit area ; four were in other states . That left the corporation with ten plants in Detroit and fourteen elsewhere , reversing the pre-bail-out proportion . In 1977 , 57.5 percent of Chrysler 's workers lived in the Detroit area . By June 1983 , 50.9 percent did . Thus the bail-out was not a smashing success at saving jobs : total employment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its peak , in 1977 , and only about two-thirds what it was before the loan guarantees . It was , of course , a smashing success at saving the company , as Chrysler 's much-trumpeted profit figures show . Chrysler made a record $482 million in the first half of this year , and analysts predict it will make more than $1 billion in 1984 . It can be argued that the 43,000 jobs saved by the bail-out are better than none , and that most of those 43,000 U.A.W. members are better off today than they would have been if Chrysler had folded . But there is another dimension to the bail-out , and that is the precedent the U.A.W. concessions set for the , labor movement . As an official of the Unit- . ' , Food and Commercial Workers Union , which was hit with a tidal wave of concession demands in 1981 , told me , " After Chrysler , everything changed . " Employers have faced hard times before without demanding concessions from their unions . In the 1974-75 recession , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many companies were losing money hand over fist , employers did n't ask for them . They did n't think the unions would let them get away with it . Before the Chrysler bail-out , union resistance to employer demands for give-backs was determined and often successful . The United Mine Workers struck for 110 days from December 1977 to March 1978 and succeeded in resisting some of the coal operators ' far-reaching demands . In 1978 employees at three companies working under " me-too " versions of the Basic Steel Agreement struck for five , six and nine months , respectively , rather than make concessions on work rules . In 1979 the U.A.W. struck Caterpillar for eleven weeks and In- , ternational Harvester for twenty-four weeks , and a coalition of unions struck Westinghouse for seven weeks . As a resit of all these strikes , management withdrew its demands fot .. kive-backs . The Chrysler agreement changed the meaning of the term " reopener , " which used to refer to a clause giving unions the right to ask for more during the term of a contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year , Detroit 's Mayor Coleman Young remarked , " We are closely examining the recent Chrysler contract , because it contains a principle which I believe we may be forced to adopt . " Detroit city workers agreed to a two-year wage freeze later that year . In May , Ford exacted work-rule concessions from employees at its Cleveland stamping plant by threatening to shut it down if they refused . The Rubber Workers Union made $27 million worth of concessions in the contract it negotiated with Uniroyal in June , breaking with the industrywide contract . In August , 12,000 workers at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel agreed to defer some raises , and Wheeling-Pittsburgh withdrew from the nine-company Basic Steel Agreement . In September , the teamsters ' union rejected Trucking Management Inc. ' s demand that it do without 49 cents of its cost of living allowance , but agreed to consider local or regional changes in the National Master Freight Agreement . The U.A.W. 's third set of Concessions to Chrysler , negotiated in January 1981 , turned the snowball into an avalanche , The union had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " not a product of free collective bargaining . " But the exception quickly became the rule as General Motors , which made three-quarters of a billion dollars on its U.S. operations in 1981 , also demanded , and received , concessions . Other economic sectors , in which companies have won concessions from their unions include the airlines , agricultural implements , aluminum , coal , construction , copper , glass , meatpacking , oil refining , rubber , steel and trucking . Profitable companies such as Kroger , Iowa Beef . Gulf , Texaco , United Parcel Service and Caterpillar have not been bashful about asking for give-backs . In 4 June 1982 Business Week poll , 19 percent of executives frk . n large companies admitted that " although we do n't need concessions , we are taking advantage of the bargaining climate to ask for them " How could the U.A W. have acted differently ? It could have told Congress and Chrysler , Hell , no It could have taken a stand not just for its members at Chrysler but for the rest of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could have argued its case to its members and to leaders of other unions , and pushed the labor movement to take a united position against concessions , as the Canadian Labor Congress did in May 1982 . That might not have discouraged other employers from demanding them . Somewhere , some union would have given in  --  if not the autoworkers , the teamsters ; if not the teamsters , the steelworkers . But , because of the U.A.W. 's historic role in the labor movement , a stand ( or a capitulation ) by it means more than a similar move by any other union . The U.A.W. had long been a pioneer in bargaining  --  it was the first major union to win a cost of living allowance , for example . But by 1982 , it was leading in the wrong direction . It was not simply the U.A.W. 's agreement to concessions but the attitude it took in negotiations that emboldened employers . Bob Weissman , president of U , A.W . Local 122 at Chrysler 's Twinsburg , Ohio , stamping plant and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the union 's point of view , concessions were logical and unavoidable . But the way in which they were given was totally inappropriate . " The union , Weissman says , should have insisted that its contract with Chrysler be restored to parity with the U.A.W. contracts at Ford and G.M. by a certain date , while retaining the option of granting the company an extension if it was still in hot water . " If we had done that , we would n't have had to push the company to reopen the contract this summer ; the company would have been begging us , " Weissman says . But the union did n't even put such a proposal on the bargaining table . Union insiders say that some members of the negotiating committee raised the possibility of doing so with Fraser in January 1980 . According to the sources , Fraser blew up at the suggestion and told the negotiators they were being unrealistic . Was the concessions plan worth it ? Weissman says , " In the form in which it was done , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs and the punishment of the remaining workers through excessive concessions And it opened a trend in the labor movement that has proven nothing short of disastrous . " The labor movement 's first experiment with " industrial policy " left it in a weakened condition . Whether union leaders know it or not , the tripartism that was a key part of the Chrysler bail-out was designed to do just that . Winning concessions is only the most obvious part of employers ' long-term strategy for shifting the balance of power permanently in their favor If labor 's best response to that strategy is to agree to be the junior member of an employer-run " partnership , " prospects for saving companies without sacrificing jobs or union leverage are slim indeed . ? McCARTHYISM IN CONGRESS Honorable Members ? TED WEISS conservatives squeezed the last possible drop of anti-Soviet sentiment from the downing of K.A.L. Flight 007 last month . The President exploited the tragedy to rally support for higher defense appropriations , construction of the MX missile and deployment of cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Europe this December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to encourage right-wing Republicans to make " softness on communism " a major issue in the 1984 elections . Indeed , on several prior occasions , my conservative colleagues in the 98th Congress have questioned the loyalty of their Democratic adversaries . Most recently , for example , the National Republican Congressional Committee accused twenty Democrats of " supporting communism " because they had opposed a Republican-sponsored amendment to the International Monetary Fund authorization bill , which the House passed on August 3 . The amendment , introduced by Republican Phil Gramm of Texas , would prohibit the United States from voting for I.M.F . loans to nations with " communist dictatorships . " Democrat Tony Coelho , chairman of the House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , criticized the N.R.C.C. 's attack as " a resurrection of McCarthyism . " Reminders of McCarthyism also surfaced in July when the House debated the Boland- Zablocki amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act of 1983 : This amendment , later passed by the House , halts U.S. support for the antiSandinist forces waging war against Nicaragua and provides aid to El Salvador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms to Salvadoran insurgents . It generated some sixteen hours of debate in the House , and as the hours wore on , Republican opponents of the Democratic initiative realized that its supporters were well organized and gaining strength . Several Republicans then resorted to Red-baiting in a last-ditch effort to persuade undecided representatives to oppose the measure . The attacks on the President 's critics were better suited to the smoke-filled halls of an American Legion convention than the floor of the House . The rhetoric was unworthy of my Republican colleagues , who usually pepper their adversaries with highbrow wit and invective . Early in the debate , however , it appeared that a few Republicans had no intenTed Weiss is a Democratic/Liberal Party Congressman from New York City . tion of obeying the House 's unwritten rules of decorum and fairness when the issue was fighting the spread of communism in Central America . Bill Young of Florida , for example , assured the House of his patriotism and suggested that his Democratic opponents did not share his loyalties : I came here first and foremost swearing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interests of my country , not some other country I want to help , but my fir:744 allegiance is to the United States But Young 's comments were mild compared with those made by other defenders of covert aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents . At one point in the debate , Tom Downey , a New York Democrat , characterized the anti-Sandinist rebels funded by the United States as " thugs , thieves and brigands . " Angered by that description of our newfound allies , Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia replied with a volley of charges that impugned the motives of those opposed to the President 's covert war . Among other things , Gingrich said : This is a vote on whether or not we are going to cripple the forces of freedom This is a vote on whether we are going to help the Soviet Union and the Cubans and the 9,000 Communist bloc advisers who are now in Nicaragua Gingrich then made a more serious attack . He said that Downey " articulated brilliantly the radical doctrine of his wing of his party , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " CIA is more dangerous than the KGB . " Similar attacks erupted during previous debates on the Boland-Zablocki amendment . In early June , when the House Foreign Affairs Committee was considering the measure , Republican Gerald Solomon of New York charged that those members of the committee who supported the amendment were selling the United States down the river to the Soviet Union . Just before the House debate on the amendment in July , Representative Young asked why those Democrats who spoke so loudly against the President 's maneuvers in Central America had been silent a year ago when the Soviet Union and Cuba held military exercises in the region Allegations like those , which question not only the soundness of members ' views but their motives as well , go beyond the traditional bounds of parliamentary civility in the House . David Obey of Wisconsin said that Young and other conservative Republicans were attempting to " assassinate the character of the person making the statement rather than to effectively assassinate the argument . " In the Reagan years , McCarthy-like charges  --  such as the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremiah Denton 's allegations about women 's peace groups  --  seem to be occurring with greater frequency and vehemence . But as this country searches for solutions to the conflicts in Latin America and the Middle East , what is sorely needed is rationality and vision , not chauvinistic breast-beating . As Obey said during the debate on the Boland-Zablocki amendment , both Democrats and Republicans are talking about " not whether we defend this country , but how . " ?
