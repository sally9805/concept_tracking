Politicians affirm that a woman 's place is in the voting booth <P> It was courting time in San Antonio . The suitors came early and stayed late . They made sure that the women staff members who accompanied them were highly visible , flourishing them like bouquets . Addressing the 800 delegates to the convention of the bipartisan National Women 's Political Caucus , they offered lyrical tributes to the ability of women to influence the election of the next President of the U.S. And with good reason . Each-Walter Mondale , John Glenn , Gary Hart , Alan Cranston and Ernest Hollings-is a Democratic contender for that very office . <P> The gender gap-the marked difference between the political views of men voters and the increasingly sizable body of women voters-rang out as the theme of the convention , set to a Texas mariachi beat . The delegates , most of them Congresswomen , state officials and activists , found that women 's status as this year 's pre-election prom queen was a lot more fun than last year 's post-ERA role as wallflower . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caucus was founded twelve years ago that the guys had come to their party . <P> On a sunny terrace above the cypress-shaded San Antonio River , four Congresswomen gleefully summed up the moment . Said Democrat Geraldine Ferraro of New York : " We 've got the issues , we 've got the gender gap on our side , and at long last the men are going to pay attention to us . " Republican Congresswomen Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe of Maine said that even the White House had begun to take notice . Not a moment too soon . The fourth member of the group , Democrat Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut , had brought both Republican and Democratic delegates to their feet cheering when she pronounced President Ronald Reagan " hopeless " on women 's issues . <P> The hostility to Reagan prompted San Antonio City Councilman Van Archer to complain : " There 's just no way in the world I can understand how 200 women who do n't shave their legs can claim to speak for the women of America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for polls . The women of America , in every social , economic and racial group and in every geographic region , have consistently given President Reagan a poorer performance rating than have men . A New York Times/CBS News poll revealed that among Republicans the discrepancy between men 's approval of Reagan and women 's is a startling 21 percentage points . Pollsters , politicians and academicians attribute that gap to several factors : women 's increasing sense of being economically disadvantaged and their more humanitarian views on social welfare ; women 's anxiety about war and resistance to military spending ; and women 's increasing desire for equality and a new independent determination to vote for politicians they consider responsive .
