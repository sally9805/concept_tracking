Lang Gerhard , part of a generation of hot stock-pickers who arose in the 1970s , is joining the many dropouts from big money management concerns who are setting up their own firms . Mr. Gerhard plans to capitalize on the current small-stock boom by launching West Highland Capital Inc . , Larkspur , Calif. , within a month or so . It will be a " hedge fund , " with flexibility to hedge the risks of the stocks it owns by selling short other shares , whose prices are expected to decline . Mr. Gerhard , 42 years old , has been peripatetic like many of his peers . He has been with McKenzie Walker Investment Management Inc. in Larkspur , Calif. , for the past year , running several hundred million dollars of investors ' money . In early 1987 , he cashed out of Forstmann Leff Associates Inc . , New York , some months after its 1986 sale to Britain ' s Guinness Peat Group PLC . People on Wall Street estimate he made $1 million a year during his three-year contract at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive , and then $3 million to $4 million from the sale of the firm . Mr. Gerhard is part of a cadre that includes William Harnisch , Forstmann-Leff ' s president , and Philip Hempleman , now running his own Ardsley Partners in New York . They sprang to prominence a decade ago as aggressive fund managers , often at big banks ' investment units . And they somehow survived the big 1973-1974 bear market . Mr. Gerhard got his start at Manufacturers Hanover Corp. when he took over its small-stock fund from a manager who shot himself in the bear market . Mr. Gerhard later became chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Management Corp . Since the early 1980s , small stocks have been out of favor , depressing Mr. Gerhard ' s performance . But he says he has " matched the market " in recent years , despite lagging investors like Mr. Harnisch who switched to top-performing big stocks . Now , with small stocks back in favor , he says , his personal equity account is up 37% for the first quarter . " He ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harnisch . Asked about Mr. Gerhard ' s departure from Forstmann-Leff , Mr. Harnisch says , " Lang wanted to pursue small stocks on a continuing basis , but we go in and out of them . " The parting of ways was " a mutual decision , " Mr. Harnisch adds . Money managers say $10 million  --  Mr. Gerhard ' s target  --  is the " critical mass " for a new hedge fund . In a good year , says one veteran , the manager ' s fee might be $500 , 000 or more . Mr. Gerhard will put $1 million of his own money in what he calls a classic hedge operation : Buying growth stocks cheaply and selling short " deteriorating situations " that are overpriced . It ' s tough to launch a fund in the post-crash climate , he concedes . He ' s using brokers and is soliciting money from family and friends . But " if it ' s easy to raise money , " he says , " it ' s probably the wrong time . " Investors who poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their moment well , he notes . Of course , if there ' s a recession , this could prove to be a bad time to be in the market . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
