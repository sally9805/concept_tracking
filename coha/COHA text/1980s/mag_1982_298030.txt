The champ 's class shows in a punishing win over Gerry Cooney <P> For once , the hackneyed billing of a fight- " The Pride and the Glory " - fit like 8-oz. gloves . Gerry Cooney turned out to be the pride , Larry Holmes the glory . In fact , Holmes was both ; he was everything . Elegant when the fight was not , eloquent when nothing needed to be said , except maybe one thing . " I 'm very sorry that I 'm not what you expect , " said Holmes after it was over . " I 'm sorry that I 'm not Muhammad Ali ... that I 'm not Joe Louis . " He even apologized for not being Leon Spinks . " I was not born to be them . " But he is the Heavyweight Champion of the World . He was born to be that . Holding up the World Boxing Council belt , Holmes paused a long moment late last Friday night and then noted for the record : " I still have it . " <P> Rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rusty from 13 months of inactivity , Cooney fought Holmes more than twelve brave rounds , until he could barely stand up and his trainer , Victor Valle , could stand no more . With fewer than ten seconds remaining in the 13th round , Valle scrambled under the ropes and ran across the ring , folded his arms about his fighter and propped his head on Cooney 's chest . He held on dearly . The fighter 's left eyelid was sliced , and the bridge of his two-tiered nose was split . <P> Cooney possesses thunder in his left hand , but he has goose down in his right , and , most unhappily of all , he does not know how to defend himself . He was knocked sprawling in the second round and sent reeling in the sixth . With fairly good body punches , though not his absolute best , Cooney surely won the fourth round and maybe he took two or three others . But that was all . Scandalously , two Nevada state athletic commission judges had him leading at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind on points only because Referee Mills Lane had deducted three for low blows . Las Vegas judges were the only mysteries left by the end of the evening . <P> " Ladies and gentlemen , " the ring announcer bellowed a few minutes after the usual postfight bedlam commenced , " a word from the challenger . " Cooney came to the center of the ring to get the microphone , and with his soft voice cracking , he told the 32,000 people exiting the parking-lot stadium at Caesars Palace , " I tried with all my heart . I love you . I 'm sorry . " Later he pledged to " go back to the gym and try harder , " saying , " I have no excuse to make . I want you to know , I did n't fight the fight for the money perhaps $10 million per man . I just wanted to win . "
