SAN FRANCISCO  --  For BankAmerica Corp. , this case has become more than a little cuckoo . Last month , the big bank finished turning over $53 million in cash and property to end a 13-year fee dispute with the state of California over the handling of dormant customer accounts . Besides ending a nagging legal matter , the bank got some publicity mileage from the novel terms . Included was the transfer of environmentally sensitive lands called home by such rare birds as the yellow-billed cuckoo . But the state is launching a prime-time TV ad that flies in the face of the publicity coup . The ad , to alert BankAmerica customers who may be eligible for refunds from the money , accuses the bank of " exploiting its own depositors " and characterizes its actions as a " rip-off . " The ad is scheduled to begin tonight , but enraged BankAmerica officials are threatening to go to court to stop it . " We think the ad is totally out of line , " said a bank spokesman . More novel options are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BankAmerica official threatened a TV counteroffensive that would give the controller a political " bloody nose " if the disputed ad stood . The official also raised the possibility of filing a defamation suit , according to Mr. Davis , who represents the state in the suit and stars in the ad . His response : directing his legal counsel to consider suing BankAmerica for threatening a public official . BankAmerica wouldn ' t confirm or deny threatening the controller with legal or political action . " We have made our objections known , " the bank spokesman said . BankAmerica used to routinely stop interest payments on old and inactive accounts after losing track of customers . It would continue service charges , however , which occasionally wiped out entire balances . The practice was common among big California banks until the state cracked down in the 1970s . A state court judge determined in 1980 that BankAmerica was liable for refunds , and the two sides spent years negotiating the exact amount . As many as two million former BankAmerica customers may be due refunds , the state estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vital because BankAmerica has turned over names and addresses of just 10% of the eligible . " We didn ' t want to put together a namby-pamby ad to which no one would pay attention , " he said . Perhaps most galling for BankAmerica is the possibility that it misjudged a onetime political ally . " This is the most unusual thing of all , " said a bank official . " Davis has been on very good terms with the bank . He hasn ' t been viscerally against financial institutions . " Chief of staff to former Gov . Jerry Brown , Mr. Davis himself is considered to have an eye on the statehouse . Some BankAmerica officials wonder if he is already campaigning . " He is running hard for governor and he has no issues , " huffs one . Mr. Davis denies any political maneuvering and says the bank is trying to " sugar-coat " its wrongdoing .
