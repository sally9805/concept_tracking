. . . Musicians , in other words , own music because music owns them . Anybody who feels strongly enough about music to go through a conservatory discipline and prepare himself for dealing with the materials of it , belongs to the world of music . He ' s joined the family . And the history of music for the next 25 years will be the story of your family operations and your family quarrels. . . // The music world is not without its economic realities . But economics are not the sense that it makes . In sport we distinguish amateurs from professionals by financial criteria . If a tennis player takes money for playing tennis , he ' s a professional ; if he doesn ' t , he has kept his amateur standing . This has nothing to do with the quality of his play . And so , as a musician , you may be a professional - that is to say , earn money - and still be irresponsible as a musician . Or you may be an amateur , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest standards known to your time . Any musician who practices his art , however modestly , in full acceptance of his obligation to maintain the highest standards that he is aware of , is a real musician. . . . // // The rewards of obstinancy and cooperation ( with fellow musicians ) are very great . They are nothing less than the satisfaction of creating an auditory universe after your image of it . That satisfaction ' s worth everything and the hope of it justifies every labor , every risk. // I can ' t promise you anything more than that because musicians don ' t - as a rule - get rich in the business , and very few even become famous . But I ' ve never known a musician who regretted being one . Whatever deceptions life may have in store for you , music itself is not going to let you down . **28;46937; ( New England Conservatory of Music , May 18 ) <> <> <> Diane Sawyer <> **28;46967; CBS News correspondent <> // When I left here graduation day I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I went back home to Louisville , Ky. , and a few weeks later my father put me through a catechism that was brilliant in its simplicity .

' ' And at the time there were no women on television in Louisville , which is why I showed up the next week at the smallest UHF station in my perfectly coordinated , dress-for-success outfit and announced that I was applying for a job as a serious journalist and commentator , and that ' s how I started my career as the nation ' s most inept local weather girl . **28;46997; ( Wellesley College , May 30 ) <> <> <> Benjamin Weir <> **28;47027; Moderator of the Presbyterian Church <> ( USA ) , former hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life was , after 14 months of isolation , suddenly experiencing a change in treatment and being put in a room with another human being , Fr .

A tremendous experience of human and spiritual community . All of this showed to me that a drive for personal success is not enough , in fact it can be a trap. . . . // To me , this brings to mind that pattern expressed in a very short sentence in the Gospel in which Jesus said , ' ' Greater love has no man than this , that a person lay down one ' s life for another .

I had 30 men , 29 rifles , and a rather unreliable light machine gun . And we were very , very happy with this and kept talking about how we were going to deal with the German invasion and how surprised they were going to be . At the end of the war , I happened to see a map of the German operational plan for the invasion of England , and got a very nasty shock when I saw what they were going to do at St. Margaret ' s Bay . They were going to land three parachute divisions behind it , four armored assault divisions on the beach , and bomb the whole thing in advance for half an hour with the whole German air force . So my 30 men and my unreliable light machine gun might perhaps have been a little bit outclassed .
