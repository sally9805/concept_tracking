IF ON A HOT SUMMER ( that is , a winter ) Sunday in 1910 you had strolled along Copacabana Beach in Rio , you might have found a few families assembled there , but most likely they would have protected themselves from the sun with hats , gloves , and parasols , and from prying eyes , intent on ascertaining their exact fleshly contours , by dark suits and dresses . But early on a hot Sunday last December , I watched one million people home in on that same beach from all over the city . They arrived by foot . tram , bicycle , bus , and car , and the hum their movement made was audible all over the city . Once they found a place on the beach they stripped down until all was exposed but their private parts , and for eight hours absorbed the hot sun . Clearly this altered attitude toward the sun and the beach defines something important in cultural modernism .

" This remarkable transformation in attitude began with a vengeance after the first world war , and one of its signs was the renewed Anglo-Saxon excitement over the Mediterranean . By issuing his novel South Wind in 1917 , Norman Douglas was reminding the British , many of whom read the book in the icy trenches , of the Mediterranean . They had always known it , of course , but after the Great War they reclaimed it with frenetic and often self-destructive enthusiasm . To sketch the history of the British imaginative intercourse with the Mediterranean in modern times is virtually to present a survey of modern British literature . It was a magical place , like the island in The Tempest , capable of generating God knows what lubriciousness and of virtually unmanning the intellect .

The Mediterranean is the model for the concept south , and it is a rare Briton whose pulse does not race at mention of that compass direction . The magic works even outside Europe proper , as it does when the traveler Robert Byron arrives in Shiraz , Persia , after a dreary winter in Tehran : " The South , the blessed South ! " he sings . " It gives me the same exhilaration as a first morning by the Mediterranean . " Asked once what makes life worth living , Connolly thought carefully and then answered , " There are only three things which make life worth living : to be writing a tolerably good book , to be in a dinner party for six , and to be traveling south with someone whom your conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South of France .

In the south , resis-tance to lust was thought so difficult that Geoffrey Gorer believed the Protestant missionaries in West Africa who asserted that their Catholic counterparts " do not take the vow of chastity " when assigned there . Another treasured possession of the British imagination between the wars is the belief that people of the south are less hypocritical than northerners .

The thing is perfectly consonant with British expectations about the hotter , " more passionate , " more sincere , and thus more interesting " south . " That direction , not the north , is after all where Douglas 's " wind " comes from . In 1929 Lawrence found Paris too far north for him , and wrote the Huxleys : I do n't want to go north , do n't want to be North , sha n't have any peace till I see the Mediterranean again , all the rest hell ! . . . the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it morally and ethically .

The Blue Train . There is excitement in just writing the words .

" On his way to Mt . Athos , in Greece . Robert Byron took the Blue Train : " Happiness untrammelled , " he noted . Waugh 's William Boot , in Scoop , took it to Marseilles on his way to Ishmaelia . It was the preferred way to get to the popular French ports like Toulon , where Anthony Powell was to be found , working on Afternoon Men .

Connolly found that " Nice is never worthy of the Blue Train . " The kind of felicity to which the Blue Train conveyed you as it let you off at Marseilles or Toulon or Cannes or Nice or Monte Carlo , whence you could go on to the Italian Riviera , to Rapallo , and all the way down to the Amalfi Coast , seemed novel in the ' 20s . It seems novel no longer because those places have provided the model for the decor and atmosphere of successful international tourism ever since . Wherever exported and transplanted out of Europe to Turkey , Mexico , Brazil , even the U.S.S.R. ? the style is the same , involving beach and sun . brightcolored aperitifs at little tables outdoors , copious fish and shellfish to eat , or popular folk music played on stringed instruments , cheap drinkable local wine , much use of oil ( olive for cooking , suntan for browning ) , all in a setting of colored architecture and colorful street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic undertone , and a certain amount of noise ( Vespas , children shouting on the beach ) provides a reassurance of life and gaiety . There must be colorful fishermen and boat-people , playing boules or something like it . There must be love on top of the sheets after the large wine lunch , with occasional hints of Roman Catholicism ( processions , the locals attending early mass , the public blessing of fishing vessels ) just sufficient to lend by contrast a slight air of wickedness to the whole frivolous operation . This scene , constituting one of the main presiding myths of the desirable for the modern urban and suburban middle proletariat , has become our version of pastoral , and in the ' 20s and ' 30s it was gradually displacing , or at least powerfully opposing , the main earlier image of the hankered-after , the traditional pastoral scene of quiet inland waters , wildflowers , sheep-filled meadows , and silence broken only by Birdsong and softly lowing cattle . These two images of the ideal divide not just generations ( Aldous Huxley versus George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand , the world of traditional Europe , satisfied with its usages ; on the other , the new international world spawned by the Great War . But one did not need to embrace this gaudy holiday image in its entirety to propose the Mediterranean as a model or norm . One could point to the Mediterranean as ' ' Rome " in the largest sense , the place where the writings construed at school originated , the place associated with the combined skepticism and sensuality and insistence on clarity resulting from the British version of " a classical education . " Complaining in Enemies of Promise ( 1948 ) that Eton taught him nothing useful , Connolly listens while Eton answers : You imply our education is of no use to you in after life . We are not an employment agency ; all we can do is to give you a grounding in the art of mixing with your fellow men , to tell you what to expect from life and give you an outward manner and inward poise , an old prescription from the eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which confers the infrequent virtues of good sense and good taste , and the benefit of dual nationality , English and Mediterranean . In E. M. Forster 's Passage to India ( 1924 ) Cyril Fielding is unique in exhibiting " good sense and good taste . " Among the British in Chandra-pore he 's the only one trained to resist the vulgar appeals of jingoism and color prejudice and self-righteousness , and his training ground has been ( no surprise for the reader of Forster 's earlier novels ) Italy . He has known it from his youth , and even the shape of his house in India reminds him a bit of Florentine architecture , the Loggia de ' Lanzi . After the mess and scandals at Chandrapore , Fielding returns to England for a vacation , and on the way he pauses in Venice , which offers an aesthetic , and thus a moral , norm for gauging India . " The buildings of Venice , " he finds again , stood in the right place . whereas in poor India everything was placed wrong . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the many-colored blanket of St. Mark 's , but something more precious than mosaics and marbles was offered to him now : the harmony between the works of man and the earth that upholds them , the civilization that has escaped muddle , the spirit in a reasonable form , with flesh and blood subsisting . In short . Fielding realizes , " The Mediterranean is the human norm . When men leave that exquisite lake , ... they approach the monstrous and extraordinary . " And that 's what 's the matter with India : it 's too far from the olive trees and the grapes , too far from the great continuous opposition between Christianity and " Rome " in the old sense that so superbly enacts the perpetual touching quarrel between spirit and flesh in mankind . 1174 OR THE MEDITERRANEAN to be reappropriated after the war , its most ubiquitous natural asset , the sun , had to be redeemed from the social stigma it had borne in the nineteenth century . Then , the better sort of people had tended not to sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the welfare of flora , they were of dubious value to persons . Before the war , the white-skinned. in India and other colonies , adhered to the socially comforting myth that whatever might be its effects on darker races , the sun was a menace to them , so fine of weave were they . To omit one 's solar topee for only a few minutes was to invite madness , " brain fever , " or death . When one young man , Rupert Mayne , went out to India , his parents told him that " the three most dangerous things that I had to watch out for in the East were wine , women and the sun . " ( It 's ironic that the are roughly the three things that in the ' 20s one went to the Mediterranean specifically to embrace . ) In India , an enlisted man of Her Majesty 's Forces who failed to wear his topee outdoors was punished instantly with a sentence of fourteen days ' confinement to barracks .

Heliophobia like this was an indispensable accessory of the class system , at home distinguishing the fine from the less fine , in the colonies administrators from underdogs . But subversive influences were at work . As early as 1902 Andre Gide , in L'Immoraliste , depicted the tubercular Michel deriving magic benefit from nude sunbathing ( in Italy , of course ) , and later one of Gide 's faithful readers , Hermann Hesse , imitated Michel , sunbathing in Italy to cure his headaches and gout . The German nudist movement , often thought a manifestation of Weimar . actually dates from the 1890s ( Whitman can be considered a precursor ) , and as early as 1903 the Swiss physician Auguste Rollier ( the author of the influential treatise Heliotherapy 1923 ) was moving his tubercular patients into the sun . The tubercular Lawrence was later going to assert , " My inmost need is the sun .

In England alone 200,000 died of it . " Sunshine is Life , " proclaimed a British railway poster of the ' 20s , soliciting the traveler to " come to the Riviera . " The critic John Weightman has called the whole movement the " Solar Revolution , " and it constitutes one of the most startling reversals in modern intellectual and emotional history . In the nineteenth century the " poetic " heavenly body was , by common consent , the moon . It is the agent of " phantom light " in Coleridge 's " Dejection , an Ode , " and it presides over the high emotion of Wordsworth 's " Strange Fits of Passion f Have Known . " It dominates Whitman 's " Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking " and " lies fair upon the straits " in Matthew Arnold 's " Dover Beach . " Edgar Allan Poe could hardly have written without invoking the " mystic moon , " as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon as a trigger of erotic dreams , as in " Annabel Lee " : . . the moon never beams without bringing me dreams/Of the beautiful Annabel Lee . " ( We may wonder whether the moon , now planted with flags and junk and crawled over by men in silver coveralls. will easily regain its former magical overtones . ) But in the twentieth century it was conventionally the sun that sent forth mystical emanations , and by the ' 30s the motif of the sun was everywhere . Art Deco would he impoverished without it . " It turned up all over the place . " says Sarah Howell , on suburban garden gates , shoes and cigarette cases , and the stepped shapes of the temples where the ancient Aztecs had worshipped their sun gods inspired the design of millions of fireplaces and wireless sets ; ... cactuses , transplanted from the desert , seemed soddenly the most desirable of house plants . The whole craze helped sustain the property booms in Florida and California as well as the vogue of " Spanish " architecture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the movement has grown automatic and intellectually unself-conscious , it has by no means spent itself : witness the rush of the French to acquire real estate on the ate d'Azur , polluted though its waters may be ; witness the popularity of the American " sun belt " and the continuing vigor of the seaside industry . But in the early ' 20s the sun fixation was so novel that at Oxford Connollv created a sensation by announcing that the time for the Riviera was not , as had been customary among valitudinarians , the winter , but during the hottest summer months ; and to advertise this heresy , Peter Quennell remembers , Connolly formed a self-conscious " Cicada Club " of five undergraduates , devoted to broiling themselves on the beaches between Marseilles and Menton . T HE POWER OF THE SUN IDEA to take over entirely a malleable mind can be studied in the case of Harry Crosby , the finally mad American who settled in France , naming his residence Le Moulin du Soleil . He established the Black Sun Press and devised a homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his back he had tattooed a sun ( to testify to his fidelity to " the Sun God " ) , and he solicited from Lawrence the short story " Sun " for his press to publish , paying him in " sunny " twenty-dollar gold pieces . He seemed to grow madder and madder until finally he murdered his mistress and killed himself . But he is only an extreme example of a sun obsession visible everywhere . In 1922 Katherine Mansfield , deciding to subject herself to the discipline of Curdjieff 's eccentric colony at Fontainebleau ( " The Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man " ) , rationalized thus : " That 's enough . To be a child of the sun . " ( For his study of " the imaginative life of English culture after 1918 . " Martin Green has invoked the traditional designation of the Italians and come up with the perfect title : Children of the Sun 1976 . ) When Lawrence arrived at Bandol in 1929 , it was the Villa Beau Soleil he selected to rent , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huxley : This place is nothing much in itself ? but I seem to be happy here , sitting on the tiny port and watch . ing the ' life ' ? chiefly dogs orwandering out on the jetty . I find I can be very happy quite by myself just wandering or sitting on a stone ? if the sun shines . Yes , one needs the sun . If anything , one needs to go farther south than here . . . But it is wonderful how sunny it is here . In 1935 Lawrence Durrell was celebrating Corfu and " the incandescence of the sun " that drew him there . A year later it was in the hot sun of the eastern Mediterranean that Edward VIII stripped down to demonstrate his rest- lessness and his longings for freedom on the yacht Nahlin with Mrs. Simpson . Looking for a title for his novel of 1926 , with its final scenes set at the port and on the beach of San Sebastian , Hemingway goes to Ecclesiastes and comes up with his title , The Sun Also Rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " titles during the period , like Alain Gerbault 's In Quest of the Sun and The Gospel of the Sun , and Alfred Noyes 's The Sun Cure . And it is from this period that we can date the Sonne in most of the hotels or Gasthfiuser that cropped up in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland . The Germanic world was the center for hedonistic nude sunbathing , and Stephen Spender was attracted there partly for that reason . ( In England nudism was still attended by Fabian highmindedness and a puritan sense of therapeutic duty , reflected in the term naturism and registered in books like Dr. Maurice Parmelee 's The New Gymnosophy I926 . ) Spender 's account of postwar Germanic sun worship in World Within World ( 1951 ) is classic . For the good-looking young Germans who befriended him , " the life of the senses was a sunlit garden from which sin was excluded " : The sun . . . was a primary social force in this Germany . Thousands of people went to the open-air swimming baths or lay down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes quite nude , and the boys who had turned the deepest mahogany walked amongst those people with paler skins , like kings among their courtiers . The sun healed their bodies of the years of war , and made them conscious of the quivering , flutter. ing life of blood and muscles covering their exhausted spirits like the pelt of an animal : and their minds were filled with an abstraction of the sun , a huge circle of fire , an intense whiteness blotting out the sharp outlines of all other forms of consciousness , burning out even the sense of time . ( At about the same time , Lawrence , imagining Mellors 's relation with Connie Chatterley , sees him " burning out the shames , the deepest , oldest shames , in the most secret places , " and he explains to Harry Crosby that Lady Chatterley 's Lover is " a phallic novel , but good and sun-wards , truly sunwards . " ) Under the all-powerful influence of the sun , Spender goes on . I went to the bathing places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young people lying in one another 's arms . This life appeared to be innocuous , being led by people who seemed naked in body and soul , in the desert of white bones which was post-war Germany . Not everyone , it is true , responded with Spender 's enthusiasm . In 1930 Evelyn Waugh wrote a skeptical piece , " This Sun-bathing Business , " for the Daily Mail , where he deposed : I hate the whole business . . . . All this is supposed to be good for you . Doctors say so . Nowadays people believe anything they are told by " scientists , " just as they used to believe anything they were told by clergymen . Another who refused to play was Auden , who carefully kept his skin its original ghastly blue-white . But Waugh and Auden generally distrusted the wilder romanticisms of their countrymen . More customary was the notion that the sun both causes and betokens a rare and precious " sincerity , " and that one reason the British display a special talent for hypocrisy is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Henry Green , " lies at the root of the way women and men behave , " with the result that " the English in their relations with each other are less frank than other nationalities to the extent to which their skies are less clear and so by the less amount of sun they have . " Forster would agree ( although he 'd write it better ) , and so would Lawrence Durrell , who argues that only under the sun can " the essential male and female relationship " flourish " uncomplicated by mirages and falsities . " IRAGES AND FALSITIES. we gather , have characterized the relation between the New York lady , Juliet , and her husband , Maurice , in Lawrence 's " Sun " ( 1926 ) . " Take her away into the sun , " is her physician 's injunction , and she sails from New York with her child , John , her mother , and a nurse , leaving a world of gray to arrive abroad at a place like the Sicilian coast . There she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast garden , or vineyard , all vines and olives . " Mother having departed , Juliet awakens to an awareness that a relation can be posited between the sun 's " coming up " and a male erection . This happens on a morning when the sun lifted himself naked and molten , sparkling over the sea 's rim . . . Juliet lay over the sea 's rim . . Juliet lay in her bed and watched him rise . It was as if she had never seen the sun rise be/ore . She had never seen the naked sun stand up pure upon the sea-line , shaking the night off himself . If here the rising sun is an erection , in Lawrence 's later The Man Who Died ( 1929 ) , also published by the Harry Crosby who could n't help associating the sun with the rites attaching to his own phallus , the erection experienced by Jesus in the presence of the Priestess of Isis is the rising sun : He crouched to her , and he felt the blaze of his manhood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am risen ! " Magnificent , blazing , indomitable in the depths of his loins , his own sun dawned , and sent its fire running along his limbs . In " Sun " Juliet is similarly astonished , and immediately " the desire sprang secretly in her to go naked in the sun . " On her rented property , she finds a spot hidden by cypresses , and there she strips and invites the sun 's rays , " half stunned with wonder at the thing that was happening to her . " What was happening was that she was " mating " with the sun . It " knew her , in the cosmic carnal sense of the word " ; and what results is a deepened Lawrentian contempt for other people who are unsunned , " so unelemental. . . . so like graveyard worms . " She soon inducts her infant boy into therapeutic sunbathing , rolling an orange , a toy sun , across the patio tiles to him . " Now , most of the day , she and the child were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . " A surprise visit from her husband , who climbs down to her sunbathing place " in his grey felt hat and his dark grey suit , " makes it clear that " he was utterly out of the picture , " hopelessly representative of the other place , the place Lawrence is constantly trying to flee . Juliet and Mau ! .. rice agree that she can not return to New York after what she 's found here ; she will stay and he will visit . But while this agreement is being reached she sees something he does not : a neighboring " hot , shy " peasant whose child she wants to bear . He is like the sun : " She had seen the flushed blood in the burnt face , and the flame in the southern blue eyes , and the answer in her had been a gush of fire . He would have been a procreative sun-bath to her , and she wanted it . " But the situation aborts in the final sentences of the story : " Nevertheless , her next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuity would cause it . " The mirages and falsities , we know , will resume , because regardless of Juliet 's efforts to reidentify herself , " the middle classes , " as Lawrence insists in the poem of that title , are sunless . They have only two measures : mankind and money , they have utterly no reference to the sun . the sun. * Today we are perhaps not so certain about our personal relation to the sun , for if we perceive that it generates the procreative ambitions of characters like Lawrence 's , we know that it causes skin cancer as welt . But while returning to something like Victorian doubts about the sun 's effect on the epidermis , we entertain none about what planners call " the magic of solar energy .
