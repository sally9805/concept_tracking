The turnout at last week 's Food and Drug Administration hearing was unusually large , with many a gleaming pate to be seen in the crowd . The subject of discussion : minoxidil ( brand name : Rogaine ) , the Upjohn Co. preparation that has given new hope to the balding and new vigor to the company 's stock . Originally marketed as a treatment for hypertension , minoxidil , in liquid form , was found by 48% of the men in an Upjohn study to produce " moderate-to- dense " hair growth if applied twice daily . Dermatologist Robert Stern , who headed an FDA advisory panel reviewing the drug , finds this a bit misleading . " Under the best circumstances , " he says , perhaps 15% would see enough hair growth " to make a visible difference . " His panel nonetheless recommended that the agency approve the drug , making it the first hair restorer to receive such an endorsement . Those most likely to be helped by Rogaine : men under 30 with just one , small bald spot and plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $600.
