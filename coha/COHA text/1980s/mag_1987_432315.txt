 | From the day she was chosen to be the first teacher in space , Christa became our country 's girl next door . That 's why her needless death broke America 's heart and spirit too On the morning of July 19 , 1985 , ten schoolteachers sat in Room 7002 of NASA headquarters in Washington , D.C. , waiting to find out which one of them had won NASA 's nationwide search for the first private citizen to fly on the space shuttle Challenger . Christa McAuliffe sat next to Niki Wenger , a finalist from West Virginia . Nearby sat Ann Bradley , a NASA executive whose job it was to tell the teachers who had won . She was waiting for the right opportunity . As Christa told Niki about Steve McAuliffe , her husband , and his life as a single parent during her absence ? particularly his penchant for eating cornflakes for supper ? Ann cut her short . " Excuse me , Christa , " she said , " but you 'd better tell your husband to get a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " You 're the one , " Ann told her . " You 're going up in space ! " Christa threw- her hands to her cheeks in a suspended moment of disbelief . No one else moved until one of the teachers , Peggy Lathlaen , rushed across the room and gathered Christa in her arms . The eight others lined up to do the same . Christa McAuliffe was not the brightest of the ten finalists . One of them was a prize-winning playwright and poet . Several knew much more about space and science than Christa knew , and the teaching projects that most of them had proposed for the six-day journey made Christa 's idea of keeping a diary look rather ordinary . Which , of course , was the difference . Christa was the girl next door , and more . No other finalist matched her potential to get NA- SA 's message across to so many people ... . Sharon Christa McAuliffe was born on September 2 , 1948 , to Ed and Grace Corrigan . Ed was soon to start his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a oneroom apartment in Boston . Christa was tempted by new frontiers at an early age , straying toward the rocks on the edge of the nearby harbor before she was 21/2 . She was so adventuresome , in fact , that her parents sometimes had trouble finding a baby-sitter for her . A year after Ed Corrigan 's graduation he took a job as an assistant comptroller in a Boston department store , and the family moved to a modest ranch house in a middle-class neighborhood of suburban Framingham . By then the Corrigans had a second child , a sixmonth-old boy named Christopher ( three other children would follow ) . As she was growing up Christa joined the Girl Scouts ; took dance , voice , and piano lessons ; and had time for sports . Her parents never pushed her , but she pushed herself . In May 1961 , 12-year-old Christa sat with her classmates in the cafeteria at Framingham 's Lincoln Ju-91  | nior High School and watched the first American manned space flight ? Alan Shepard 's brief journey into space . Later she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride in space someday . On the first day of her sophomore year at Marian High School , a small Catholic school , Christa meta new boy in homeroom , a transfer student named Steven McAuliffe . For a month the two admired each other from a distance . Then one Saturday morning Steve spotted Christa and her friend Anne Malavich walking into a drugstore in downtown Framingham . Working up his courage , he followed them in . Christa was standing in front of him at the candy counter , smiling . Malavich introduced them . They were 15 years old . The youngsters began dating , and " from then on it was everlasting , Steve and Christa , " said her father . By 16 , Christa and Steve knew they were in love , but to the relief of their parents and the nuns , they agreed to wait to marry until they finished college . Christa was not the most beautiful or brilliant girl in her class , but she was one of the most spirited . " There was a special vibrancy to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell by looking at her that she was excited about everything life held before her . " In her senior year Christa was accepted at Framingham ( Mass . ) State College . Steve accepted a scholarship at Virginia Military Institute , hundreds of miles away . They saw each other as often as they could . Christa was a child of her generation , and like many students she was affected by the Vietnam War and political assassinations of the era . She protested against the war , wore a black armband to her graduation , and spoke loudly about the rights of women , blacks , and anyone she believed deserved a better deal . " I guess I hoped I could change the world , " she said . Christa and Steve were married at St. Jeremiah 's Church in Framingham on August 23 , 1970 , eight weeks after they had graduated from college and two days before Steve was to enter Georgetown University Law School in Washington , D.C. They were 21 years old and jobless , with S500 between them . In Washington the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaches . But Christa , charmed as ever , found work within a week as a substitute history teacher at a nearby junior high school . A year later she was hired to teach English and history at Thomas Johnson Junior I-Iigh in Lanham . There , she developed her favorite teaching tool ? the field trip ? taking  | her students to historic places like Williamsburg , Va. , and Gettysburg , Pa . She wanted them to learn as much from seeing and doing as they could from reading . During the next eight years while Steve earned his law degree and clerked in a private practice , Christa taught full-time and earned her master 's degree at Maryland 's Bowie State College . Their careers on course , they bought a modest home in suburban Oxon Hill ? and started a family . On September 11 , 1976 , Christa gave birth to Scott Corrigan McAuliffe in the hospital at Andrews Air Force Base . Two years later Steve was hired as an assistant to the New Hampshire attorney general , and the McAuliffes moved into an aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 , Christa gave birth to a daughter , Caroline . Two months later she returned to teaching ninth graders at the nearby Bow Memorial School , where she became president of the teachers ' union and negotiated a contract for higher salaries for teachers . When she was offered a job at Concord High School in 1982 , she accepted . She taught history , law , and economics , more intent than ever on making her subjects come alive and inspiring her students to reach as high as they could . " Any dream can come true if you have the courage to work at it , " she said . " I would never say , Well , you 're only a C student in English , so you 'll never be a poet . ' You have to dream . We all have to dream . " Her colleagues had only two com'plaints about her : her obsession with field trips that too often made her students miss their next class , and her annoying habit of putting everything off to the last minute . Her school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On August 27 , 1984 , she and Steve were driving through Concord when they heard an interesting news item on the car radio : " Today , " President Reagan said , " I am directing NASA to begin a search to choose as the first citizen passenger in our space program one of America 's finest ? a teacher . " Christa smiled at Steve , and he smiled back . " It 's a ' do n't miss , ' " he said . " Go for it . " NASA 's profile of the perfect teachernaut was : a gifted communicator , a strong role model ? and an angel from Madison Avenue . " We 're not looking for Superman , " said Ed Campion , a NASA public-affairs officer . " We 're looking for the person who can do the best job of describing their experience on the shuttle to  | the most people . " As Christa threw herself into the new school year that fall , she nearly forgot about the contest . When her 25-page application arrived in the mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten about it had her husband not started prodding her soon after Christmas . Finally she started filling it out . She had obtained permission for a year 's sabbatical ( if she won , NASA would pay her salary of $26,681 , plus living , travel , and child-care expenses ) , and she had signed a contract in which she surrendered her rights to most government benefits including life insurance . She had also thought of an idea for the required project she would conduct on the six-day shuttle mission ? keeping a diary ? but worried that the judges might consider it frivolous . Christa mailed her application on the deadline : February I. 1985 : she was among nearly 11,500 applicants . Sailing through the first interviews , Christa was named one of the two nominees from New Hampshire in April 1985 . During the next two weeks she and Robert Veilleux , the other New Hampshire nominee , underwent medical tests and answered questions in a videotaped interview that would be used by judges in the next round of the selection process in Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete in a six-day talent contest that would narrow the field to ten . From the ten , NASA would select the teacher to fly on mission 51-L ? the shuttle Challenger ? scheduled for liftoff on January 22 , 1986 . NASA flew in two astronauts ? Judith Resnik and Joseph Allen ? to Washington to share the wonders of space flight with the 113 teachers . Resnik explained that her flight a year before had been postponed for two months while engineers repaired a faulty valve . The delay proved that NASA was " very cautious , " she said . We take our time because we only have one chance to do it right . " Spellbound , the teachers listened as Resnik described the actual flight . Christa hunched forward . fascinated . After the 113 interviews had been conducted and evaluations made , it was the job of Terri Rosenblatt of the Council of Chief State School Officers , which helped conduct the contest , to notify the ten finalists . By then Christa had left Washington for Concord . It was 3 A.M. when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . " It 's for you , " he said . " It 's someone from NASA . You made the final ten . " Christa shot up from the bed . " If you 're kidding , " she said , half asleep , " you are in BIG trouble ! " Finalist Christa McAuliffe arrived at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston . Texas , on Sunday . July 7 , for physical and psychological testing . The next day she , like the other nine finalists , answered 668 questions about her medical history and submitted to a series of tests . She felt as if she were competing in a prize fight and a beauty contest all on the sarrie day . The next afternoon she faced the press . She had a nervous giggle and the gee-whiz bounce of a camp counselor , but she was more comfortable than ever around reporters . When one of them asked her why she wanted to go into space , she said if she had lived in an earlier time she would have sailed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early airplanes . " What about your family ? How do they feel ' ? " asked one reporter . She said her husband wanted to be the first lawyer in space . her son Scott was tickled that one of his stuffed frogs had . a chance to fly , and her young daughter Caroline was still confused . Soon came Christa 's ride on the " vomit comet " ? a NASA jet that plummets from high altitudes to simulate the sensation of weightlessness . When the jet dove and then rose suddenly , the teachers found themselves floating ? weightless . Giddy . they bounced off the walls and somersaulted through the cabin . " E-E-E-EOW , " Christa shouted . Their preliminary testing over in Houston , the teachers faced the final round of interviews in Washington . Afterward the judges needed only a few minutes to deliberate . Their first vote was unanimous : Christa McAuliffe ... . Sworn to secrecy ? she was n't allowed to call her husband until after the public announcement ? Christa and the other finalists soon were whisked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President George Bush announced Christa as the winner , she shook his hand , leaned toward the microphone . and said . " I 've made nine wonderful friends over the last two weeks , and when that shuttle goes . there might be one body " ? sobbing once , she raised her finger to her lips to steel herself ? " but there 's gon na be ten souls I 'm takin ' with me . " Two hours later she was finally able to call Steve at his law office in Concord . As she told him about the day , all the suspense and all the joy converged into one long , hearty laugh . " Steve , " she said . " This just is n't possible , is it ? " By the time Christa returned to Concord that evening , her hometown was already hot with " Christa fever . " The next day she sat in the back of a Mercedes Benz convertible for a triumphant parade down Main Street . Smiling proudly . Christa kept her thumb high . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's victory was their victory . The next day , searching for a few private moments , she retreated with Steve and the children to the Concord Country Club . Nothing about the space sabbatical bothered her more than being away from her family , but she was a working mother about to enter one of the most exhilarating jobs of all . She had explained that to Scott and Caroline and believed they would learn more from seeing her reach for the stars than from seeing her pass up the chance . All the attention she 'd attracted had little value , however , until she rode the Challenger , and at that moment ? July 29. 1985 ? the Challenger was a wounded bird . Five minutes after the spacecraft took off that day with five astronauts aboard , one of its three engines had failed . The craft eventually reached a lower , but , safe orbit 197 miles above the Earth , 50 miles lower than planned ? but the crew had survived a dangerous moment . Christa was more relieved than frightened by the incident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the point is that they were able to do that , " she said . " I 'm not nervous . I 'd just like them to get the kinks out . " She had no idea that later that day an engineer for Morton Thiokol , Inc. , manufacturer of the shuttle 's booster rockets , had written a memo to senior management warning of problems in the 0-rings , the rubber insulation between the Challenger 's sausagelike joints . He worried that fiery gases would burn through the joints during a future shuttle launch . " The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order ? loss of human life , " the engineer had written . Christa went to Washington two weeks later to visit the NASA education people and design the lessons she would teach schoolchildren from space . She also met Dick Scobee , the 46-yearold commander of mission 51-L.  | Scobee had worried Christa . She knew her sudden fame had bred contempt among a few people in the space agency , and little had frightened her more than the thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how deeply they resented her . From the start Scobee left no doubt that he was in charge and that Christa was a member of a team that had been chosen for a space mission , not a joy ride . But Christa realized that he was not the macho jet jockey she had feared he might be . She felt Scobee liked her . Christa returned to Concord more excited than ever . She still had to make sure Scott and Caroline had enough back-to-school clothes and to brief Steve on the children 's daily routines . Jane Cogswell , the wife of their school principal , had agreed to pick up the children after school and watch them until Steve finished work . A fellow teacher . Eileen O'Hara , agreed to be Christa 's replacement at Concord High . On Monday , September 2 , Christa celebrated her 37th birthday , and a week later she walked out her front door , ready to leave her family . Young Scott was proud of his mother , but he did n't want her to go away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dad shoved Christa 's suitcases into the car . Caroline had a harder time coping . She had cried each time Christa had gone away since the White House ceremony . and when Steve took her to the airport to pick up Christa after an absence , a woman had asked the little girl who she was waiting for . Caroline answered , " My mommy . " " Is this the first time she 's been away ? " the woman asked . " No , " Caroline said . " She does this a lot . She comes and goes and comes and goes .... " Now her mother was going away for weeks . Christa walked across the yard , hugged Scott and kissed him good-bye . Then she kneeled and hugged Caroline . " Be a good girl , " she said . " I love you . " As they hugged each other tighter , their eyes filled with tears . " Okay , honey , " Christa said after a few seconds . " I have to go now . I 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second day in training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Christa met her crew mates : Scobee ; Mike Smith , who had a master 's degree in science ; Judy Resnik , a doctor of electrical engineering ; Ellison Onizuka , an aerospace engineer ; and Ronald McNair. a doctor of physics . Although Scobee had already given Christa the crew 's blessing , the others soon put her at ease . They liked her and she knew it . They had accepted her as a team player . Christa settled into a furnished apartment at Peachtree Lane , a sprawling complex a mile from the space center . After a day 's training she often sat at her desk past midnight poring through training manuals . She decorated the walls with pictures of Steve and the kids , and she called them nightly . How was Steve faring ? " When Working Mother the magazine is looking for a husband of the year , " he joked , " they know where to find me . " But he never complained about the sacrifices . On October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Greg Jarvis . a satellite engineer for the Hughes Aircraft Company . Like Christa , he had won a contest , beating out 600 Hughes engineers to become a payload specialist . Christa liked him . Whenever she got a chance , Christa went home to Concord . She spent several weekends there and , in October , managed to spend a week with her family . By mid-November she and Jarvis had begun training more often with their five astronaut crew mates ? some preparations as complex as mock disasters , others as routine as deciding on the few personal items they could take into space . Christa had promised Scott she would take along his stuffed toy frog , Fleegle . Steve gave her his class ring to take , and Caroline gave her the cross and chain she had received at birth . In mid-December Christa took a last quick trip back to Concord for the holidays . On Christmas morning the McAuliffes attended church then drove to Framingham for a quiet day with their families . Steve had rarely given Christa jewelry , but this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She loved them . She said she would take them with her on the shuttle . A week later she left home for the last time . By all accounts 1986 was to be a banner year for the space shuttle . But in early January the shuttle Columbia set a space-agency record for futility . Seven times in 25 days the starcrossed orbiter was scheduled to enter space , and seven times it failed to get off the ground . Because of the delays , the Challenger 's scheduled liftoff was pushed back from January 22 to the 23rd , the 24th , and then Saturday , the 25th . Christa knew the delays were vital to safety , but her patience , never her strongest trait , soon wore thin . She and her crew mates had invited nearly 3,000 friends and relatives to witness the launch at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Fla . Christa 's parents had arrived just after New Year 's in nearby Cocoa Beach , where they settled into a condominium a few miles from the space center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An enterprising parent had wangled an all-expenses-paid field trip to Florida for the third graders . What if the children waited for a flight that never got off the ground ? Steve and the children left for Florida in mid-January ? Scott bound for a cut-  | rate motel in Cocoa Beach with his classmates , Steve and Caroline for a villa at Disney World . Then came the news that the mission had been delayed one more day to the 26th , the morning of Super Bowl Sunday . The culprit was a dust storm at an emergency landing strip in Senegal . Some 15,000 special guests were waiting to see the Sunday launch , but because of cold , rainy weather NASA again scrubbed the liftoff until Monday morning . The only blessing was that 2.5 million students and their teachers could now watch the lift-off live from their classrooms . It was , after all , the children 's mission . On a chilly , but cloudless , Monday came another delay , this one due to a problem with the hatch . By the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lift-off . So after five and a half hours in the orbiter , lying flat on their backs , strapped onto their seats , the mission was scrubbed and the crew returned to their quarters . That night Christa ate an early dinner there with Steve . then kissed him good-bye . Later she made a quick call to her teaching colleague . Eileen O'Hara , in Concord . " 1 still ca n't wait ! " she told her . Neither could NASA . A record cold front was due to rush in and last through Tuesday 's 9:38 A.M. launch time . No shuttle had been launched at a temperature below 51 degrees . but the space agency was about to test the Challenger 's limits . Pressure to meet its schedule was intense . For the first time in the history of the shuttle program , NASA decided to load the external fuel tank in sub-freezing weather . Engineers for Morton Thiokol urgently cautioned that cold temperatures could cause the 0-rings to lose their resilience and allow explosive gases to leak but the engineers were overruled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground crew began loading the external tank with the super-cold , highly explosive liquid oxygen and hydrogen . Twenty minutes later the fueling stopped . A computer had detected an electrical problem . The launch was pushed back to 10:38 A.M. While the Challenger crew slept , the temperature dipped to 24 degrees , the wind chill to 10 below zero . The astronauts awoke at 6:20 and gathered for breakfast . They smiled when NASA cooks placed a white-frosted cake on the table . The cake was decorated with their crew emblem , the shuttle Challenger and each of their names . At 7:20 they received their final weather briefing . They were told about the 24-degree temperature , the wind chill , and the ice at the launch pad . But the winds had begun to weaken and the sky was clear . They were encouraged . A few minutes later Scobee led the crew down the ramp past the roped-off throng of photographers . Christa 's bounce was back in her stride . " We 're going to go off today , " she said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scobee donned his helmet and safety harness and crawled into the orbiter . Smith followed , then Resnik . Before Christa crawled in , Johnny Corlew , a quality-assurance inspector . gave her a gift ? a red apple . " Save it for me , " she said , " and I 'll eat it when I get back . " The others followed her , then Corlew closed the hatch . Seconds later Launch Control radioed the crew to test their headsets . " Good morning , Christa , " the controller said . " Hope we go today . " " Good morning , " she said . " Hope so too . " They were her last known words . At 9:08 the countdown stopped unexpectedly . Rocco Petrone , the president of Rockwell Space Transportation Systems , which built and managed NASA 's shuttle fleet , had seen television pictures of the icicles on the launch pad . Concerned , he called the space agency to advise against a launch . NASA dispatched its ice-inspection team . An hour later NASA managers determined that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time to a launch at 11:38 . The news sparked a brief celebration in the viewing area . NASA had bused in Scott McAuliffe 's classmates , who stood with Christa 's parents and dozens more spectators . Christa 's sister , Lisa , and brother , Christopher . stood there as well . Steve , Scott , and Caroline were watching with the families of the other crew members at the Launch Control Center , four miles from the pad . Now it was 11:29 . Millions of students and their teachers were watching on television . At one kindergarten five miles from Concord . N.H. , teacher Rosemary Martin told her students they were not about to watch a scene from Star Wars . " This is not a fantasy , " she said . " It 's real . " " Ninety seconds and counting , " said the voice on the loudspeaker . Grace Corrigan clutched Lisa 's shoulder with her right hand and pressed the fingers of her left into Ed 's back . Ed pulled her close . With six seconds to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Launch Control Center , Scott and Caroline stood at Steve 's side , watching . Then , at 11:38 the solid rocket boosters ignited and the Challenger lifted off . Seventy-three seconds into flight the shuttle exploded , sending the seven crewmates to their deaths . Epilogue Immediately after the explosion , Steve McAuliffe fled into seclusion , sad , lonely , and angry . He stayed with Scott and Caroline in Florida for a few days . trying to help them understand what had happened before they returned to a home filled with reminders of their mother . Scott soon accepted Christa 's death , but Caroline needed time . She remembered Christa 's coming and going so often in recent months that she believed Christa would return again . On the day Christa was to have taught from space , Steve flew from Florida to the Johnson Space Center in Houston to join the families of the other crewmates and hear President Reagan eulogize the Challenger crew . When Steve and the children returned to Concord , they did so amid a worldwide display of sympathy ? and shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to anger when there were indications that Challengcis mission failed not because of technological imperfections. but human error . A presidential commission later reported that the Challenger exploded because NASA managers ignored months of warnings about the shuttle design and allowed Challenger to lift off in weather so cold it caused the O-rings to fail . Two of the astronaut 's wives filed lawsuits against NASA . On May 1 . 1986 , after her remains had been recovered from the sunken capsule , Christa 's family buried her in Concord 's public cemetery . Then , with the help of Grace Corrigan , who moved in with Steve and the children , the family quietly returned to their normal routines . Steve 's colleagues at work raised a wall of silence around him . In July Steve spoke publicly about Christa for the first time since her death when he flew to Louisville to address the National Education Association 's annual convention and accept an award on her behalf . " People considered Christa ' a Pollyanna in teacher 's clothing , ' the girlnext-door , and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . But she was the best kind of Pollyanna ? a Pollyanna with a strong sense of realism and pragmatism . . . " He urged the educators to continue Christa 's dream by working to improve the nation 's schools . Steve returned to Concord later that day with Scott and Caroline . It was July 4th , and that afternoon two tiny , new American flags , the kind children plant , appeared on Christa 's grave .
