Dmitri Shostakovich 's Lady Macbeth is a top modern opera <P> Any list of the great 20th century operas would have to start with Puccini 's Turandot and Richard Strauss 's Der Rosenkavalier , which summed up , respectively , the Italian and German romantic traditions . It would also include Debussy 's Petteas et Melisande , the French composer 's 1902 masterpiece of Gallic allusion and understatement ; Benjamin Britten 's Peter Grimes , the most important work to enter the international repertory since World War II ; and Alban Berg 's twin monuments - Wozzeck , the seminal opera of our time , and Lulu , the apotheosis of the twelve-tone system . <P> <P> Now another candidate must be added to that list : Dmitri Shostakovich 's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk , which resurfaced last week in San Francisco . The composer 's second and last opera - his first was the bitingly satirical The Nose ( 1928 ) , based on a story by Gogol - has had a checkered history . Completed in 1932 , hailed as a major achievement at its premiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years later as Katerina Ismailova , the opera electrified its first audiences in both Russia and the West with its sexual frankness . One early critic , referring to the lascivious trombone slides that accompany the furious lovemaking of Katerina and Sergei in Act I , called the music " pornophony . " But the opera proved popular , with 83 performances in Leningrad and 97 in Moscow before it offended the delicate sensibilities of the Soviet commissars , who denounced it in Pravda as " Muddle Instead of Music . " Shostakovich , the only important 20th century Russian composer who worked entirely under the Soviet system ( Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky eventually settled in America , and Prokofiev spent many years abroad ) , found himself labeled an " enemy of the people " and for a while even feared for his life . It took him more than a year to restore his reputation as a good Soviet citizen with his Fifth Symphony . Meanwhile , Lady Macbeth , a brief candle , disappeared from the stage . <P> When Shostakovich revised the opera in 1956 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text ( based on Nikolai Leskov 's 1865 story ) . It was essentially the same work that had fallen afoul of Pravda , but noticeably missing were the trombone slides , the most literal music depiction of sexual intercourse since the famous interrupted climax in Act II of Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde and the lusty horn whoops in the prelude to Der Rosenkavalier . <P> There is no doubt that some of Shostakovich 's revisions-the smoothing out of the occasionally jagged vocal lines , the more polished transitions between scenes , the improved thematic development-represent the mature second thoughts of a composer who had already completed ten of the 15 symphonies he was eventually to write . But as a rule , first impulses tend to be more vital and visceral : Hindemith 's first version of Cardillac , for example , or Verdi 's original Don Carlos . The same is true of Lady Macbeth . As staged by the enterprising San Francisco Opera , which gave Katerina Ismailova its U.S. premiere in 1964 , Lady Macbeth showed a power and raw urgency that was weakened by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
