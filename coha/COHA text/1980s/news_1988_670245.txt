It ' s been nearly nine months since the crash . The stock market diverged from the 1930 doomsday chart about three months ago . Stocks were up 13% in the first half . So when can we say the bear market is over ? " My feeling is it ' s probably over now , " says David Dreman of Dreman Value Management in New York . He calls the 1988 strength , with small stocks up 20% , impressive , especially with the economy showing few signs of recession . " I certainly don ' t think we ' re going back to new lows . It may be that we ' ve had a one-quarter bear market . " A few money managers who have sat out this year ' s rally in cash have begun to tiptoe back . Samson Wang , president of the Beacon Capital Management unit of Bank of New York , won plaudits for moving to 100% cash before the crash . But he recently moved 15% of his assets back in stocks . He declined to discuss his reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly enough . " Eric Miller , chief investment officer of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , says , " The number of people expecting that we ' re going to break below the October low 1738. 74 has been shrinking rapidly . " But plenty of bears remain unconvinced . They argue that things could turn around in a minute . For example , the trade-deficit number due out Friday could widen unexpectedly , prompting a sudden turnaround in the dollar ' s rally that could thwack both stocks and bonds . Others argue the inevitability of fate . " People are missing the big picture and concentrating on the nearby action , " says Richard Russell , publisher of Dow Theory Letters in La Jolla , Calif . " I think we ' re in the early beginning of a major bear market . Once a bear market starts at an extreme overvaluation , it ends in severe undervaluation . There ' s nothing that hints at undervaluation . " For example , stocks ' ratio of price-to-book-value , a yardstick that got way overblown in the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical norm of around 1. 6 , Mr. Russell says . " Before this is over , you ' ll see stocks at 1 times or even lower . " Robert Prechter , editor of the Elliot Wave Theorist in Gainesville , Ga. , says a strong economy is one of the market ' s technical problems because this kind of environment " usually coincides with tops . " He says that the 1982-87 bull market anticipated the current economic boom , but that its level now  --  600 points below the highs  --  means the economy will weaken . Mr. Prechter says price patterns since the December low of 1766. 74 tell him " the odds of it being a new bull market are extremely small . " If Mr. Prechter gained forecasting eminence during the bull market , Shearson Lehman Hutton market analyst Elaine Garzarelli picked it up by staying out of stocks just before the crash . She agrees with Mr. Dreman that the bear market is over . One reason opinions differ : There is no standard definition for a bull or bear market , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth in the gross national product ) . Ms. Garzarelli defines a bull market as a 20% rise in stock prices over at least six months . With the market up 24% over the past seven months , she calls this a new bull market . With long-term Treasury bonds yielding about 9% , she says the market price-earnings ratio should be 13. 5 instead of its current 12 . So she remains bullish . But she ' s only 70% bullish because economic momentum is decelerating , and short-term interest rates remain high . Some cynics worry that recession will arrive after the presidential election . But Steven Reynolds , head equity manager at Bankers Trust Investment Management Group , says both candidates are moving to the middle . And in any case , he says , " the financial markets are riding herd on the politicians . We saw that in October . If Dukakis says he ' s going to spend $40 billion on health care , the financial markets say , ' No , you ' re not . ' " Mr. Reynolds says a deceleration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market rotation from " industrial renaissance stocks " to more predictable growth companies . But he believes that in a U.S. economic slowdown , domestic companies won ' t get hit as hard with the dollar at its current level . He too says the bear market is over . But Steven Einhorn , portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs , believes most investors wouldn ' t accept the notion that a new bull market has begun until the Dow crosses 2400 or 2500 . " The levels we ' ve achieved now are certainly not consistent with the notion of a new bull market . " Mr. Einhorn maintains this is still a bear market , but one featuring " a slow , steady erosion over some long period of time " instead of a headlong collapse . But unlike Mr. Russell , he believes salvation is possible if the dollar keeps rising or oil prices fall further . Either , he says , could lower interest rates and boost stocks.  --  - Friday ' s Market Activity A surprisingly strong June employment report intensified fears of higher inflation and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Average dropped 16. 54 to 2106. 15 , and broader market averages also slipped . Volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell to a sleepy 136. 1 million shares from 156. 1 million Thursday . For the week , the industrial average fell 25. 43 points , despite reaching a postcrash high Tuesday of 2158. 61 , after higher prices for oil and other commodities stoked inflation fears . Such concerns mounted on the news that June unemployment fell a stunning 0. 3 percentage points to 5. 3% , and that the nonfarm payroll increased 346 , 000 . The bond market reacted first , with Treasury issues dropping as much as a point , and stock prices followed . But some analysts were heartened that stocks didn ' t react more drastically , thanks partly to the dollar , which rose on the prospect of higher interest rates .

And The Wall Street Journal reported the company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large block of its stock , in part to ward off potential acquirers . First Boston climbed 2 3/8 to 38 1/4 . A Prudential-Bache analyst told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that the company is likely to announce a restructuring with its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , by the end of the current quarter . It could include a buy-out of public shareholders at $45 to $50 a share . Sun Co. , which plans to spin off its domestic oil-and-gas exploration and production business to shareholders , jumped 4 1/4 to 60 1/2 . And Florida Steel jumped 3 5/8 to 47 .
