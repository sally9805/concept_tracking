Instead , the biographical " Film Actress " concludes with some timorous advice delivered by its heroine , the actress Kinuyo Tanaka ( played by Sayuri Yoshinaga ) , to one of Japan ' s greatest directors , Kenji Mizoguchi , as they begin work on the masterpiece ( Mizoguchi ' s " Life of Oharu , " made in 1951 ) that will mark a turning point in both their careers . Speaking up , for a Japanese actress of Miss Tanaka ' s era , is victory enough. // " Film Actress " is , among other things , an engrossing study of how the Japanese film industry ' s way of doing things has differed from Hollywood ' s methods . The history of Japanese film making is the film ' s true subject , and Mr. Ichikawa , in his characteristically cool and oblique manner , approaches it in an unexpected fashion . He uses the trajectory of Miss Tanaka ' s career , which began in 1924 and ended with her death in 1977 , to focus attention on the conditions under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deals extensively with Miss Tanaka ' s life off screen , it has an impersonal feeling . Private life , to the film ' s characters and seemingly to Mr. Ichikawa as well , can not compare in importance to what happens on the screen . Besides , the film views Miss Tanaka as an elusive and curiously naive figure , at least in the early stages of her career . " You ' re clever , yet virtuously old-fashioned , " someone says to her later on. // After a prologue in which technicians are seen developing film stock ( " It ' s a wonderful invention , " one exclaims ) , the young Miss Tanaka is seen with her family , as they nervously prepare a celebratory dinner . The festivities are in honor of the director Hiroshi Shimizu ( Toru Watanabe ) , who has arranged for Miss Tanaka to be hired as a contract player by Japan ' s powerful Shochiko/ Studio . The family is excited , but for different reasons from those Western audiences might expect . They are glad because this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if Miss Tanaka becomes famous , her long-lost , draft-dodging brother may be induced to return home. // The studio system into which Miss Tanaka is introduced is , by Western standards , a stunningly decorous one . The office of the studio head Shiro Kido ( Koji Ishizaka ) is an austere book-lined room reminiscent of a high school principal ' s quarters ; the studio executives ' credo is , as one puts it , that " entertainment must produce happy feelings. " // The wardrobe department features stacks of neatly folded kimonos , and actresses preparing for their roles are gathered into a single dressing room , where together they sew , put on makeup and whisper . And the concept of a casting couch is such anathema that the director Shimizu actually bursts into the actresses ' room and challenges the gossip about himself and Miss Tanaka head-on . " Who says I patronize Tanaka for my personal reasons ? " he demands to know , after hearing complaints that his protegee is monopolizing too many major roles . " Who ? " // Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanaka do become romantically involved , though the studio head advises that they avoid marriage to preserve the actress ' s girlish image . Though this union ends disastrously , Miss Tanaka finds herself many years later developing an extracurricular attachment to another of her directors , the brilliant and difficult Mizoguchi. // Mr. Ichikawa , who can be difficult in his own right , chooses to make a slight alteration in the spelling of Mizoguchi ' s name ( the film calls him " Mizouchi " ) because some of the facts of the film maker ' s life have been rearranged . He was not a widower when he and Miss Tanaka made " Life of Oharu , " for example . More important , he bitterly opposed her subsequently becoming Japan ' s first female director , and their friendship ended as a result of this schism . " Film Actress " is quirky enough to overlook Miss Tanaka ' s directorial career altogether. // Shot in color , and making no effort to be faithful to the period in which it takes place , " Film Actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese cinema . These passages , from a 73-year-old director who began his own career as an animator in the 1930 ' s , have enormous resonance . There are glimpses of silent films , early talkies , even a Western-style musical in color ; there are excerpts from what a narrator calls the " nihilistic dramas of the 1920 ' s " ( " Why are humans mortal ? " a character in one such film wants to know . " I wish I could live forever . Even after I die I ' ll be your wife " ) . // These montages are brief but mesmerizing , and the film also includes discussion of Western influences on Japanese film makers , with excited references to Griffith ' s " Broken Blossoms " and Chaplin ' s " Woman of Paris. " // The dialogue ( the screenplay is by Kaneto Shindo , who wrote a novel about Kinuyo Tanaka , along with Shinya Hidaka and Mr. Ichikawa ) can sometimes be expository and stiff ( " Ozu , I hear you ' ll be a director , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film ' s pace is determinedly slow . Still , " Film Actress " is fascinating in its ambition and its enthusiasm . And Miss Yoshinaga ' s shy yet steely performance is a quiet tribute to the woman she plays . <> <> THE WAY IT WAS - FILM ACTRESS , directed by Kon Ichikawa ; screenplay ( Japanese with English subtitles ) by Kaneto Shindo , Shinya Hidaka and Mr. Ichikawa ; story by Mr. Shindo ; cinematography , Yukio Isohata ; edited by Chizuko Osada ; music by Kensaku Tanigawa ; art direction , Shinobu Muraki ; produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka and Mr. Ichikawa ; a Toho production .
