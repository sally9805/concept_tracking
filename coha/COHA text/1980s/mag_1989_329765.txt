THE STORYTELLER by Mario Vargas Llosa <P> Translated by Helen Lane <P> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux <P> 246 pages ; $17.95 <P> The unnamed narrator of Mario Vargas Llosa 's ninth novel has practically everything in common with his creator : age ( early 50s ) , nationality ( Peruvian ) , occupation ( writer ) . Similarly , the two share a common cosmopolitanism , having spent large swatches of their adult lives in Europe . An autobiographical strain has often appeared in Vargas Llosa 's fiction , perhaps most notably and entertainingly in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter ( 1982 ) . The Storyteller captures the author  --  and his surrogate  --  in a subdued and ruminative mood . <P> The reflections are triggered by a chance encounter . On a sabbatical in Italy , reading for a change rather than writing , the narrator wanders through Florence and comes upon a small gallery exhibiting photographs from Peru . One of them arrests his attention . It shows a group of Amazonian Indians arranged in a circle around a standing figure , who seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe captured in the picture : the Machiguengas . He is also convinced he knows the identity of the mysterious speaker . It must be Saul Zuratas , a close friend when both were university students in Lima during the mid-1950s . But how can that possibly be ? <P> Saul is vividly recollected from the old days : Jewish , with springy red hair and a purplish birthmark covering the right half of his face . He is distinguished also by his growing interest in the tribes of Amazonia and their right to survive . The narrator recalls provoking his friend on this subject : " Should 16 million Peruvians renounce the natural resources of three- quarters of their national territory so that 70 or 80 thousand Indians could quietly go on shooting at each other with bows and arrows , shrinking heads and worshipping boa constrictors ? " Saul 's response is skimpy on particulars but firm in conviction : " Though we do n't understand their beliefs and some of their customs offend us , we have no right to kill them off . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part company . Later , though , the narrator finds himself thinking more and more about Saul 's fascination with so-called primitive people . He wonders , in particular , about evidence that the besieged Machiguengas , dispersed into small groups by enemies and harsh conditions , retain their sense of community through a storyteller who travels wherever listeners can be found , recounting tribal legends , history and gossip . Such a person , the determined writer concludes , amounts to " tangible proof that storytelling can be something more than mere entertainment . "
