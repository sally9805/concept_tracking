Like many an artist who can calculate by the calendar that his fertile middle years may be drawing to a close , Neil Simon has seemed in recent writing to seek a greater resonance between his plays and his most personal recollections , and to yearn for the respect that accrues to a creator who examines himself . His 21st Broadway play , which is still running , was Brighton Beach Memoirs , a depiction of life in Brooklyn in the 1930s in a lower-middle- class Jewish household much like his own . It won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award as best play , and was justly likened to Ah , Wilderness ! and Our Town as a nostalgic celebration of lost family virtues . The show also made a star of Matthew Broderick ; he won a Tony as the narrator , the precocious Eugene Morris Jerome , whose wry journal entries the script purported to be . <P> For those who loved the character , Broderick 's endearingly klutzy impersonation , Gene Saks ' straightforward staging and the humanity of the author 's reminiscence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway installment of a planned autobiographical trilogy . Biloxi Blues sends Eugene to Mississippi for basic training in 1943 . He faces authority and danger , anti-Semitism and assimilation . He methodically loses his virginity with a prostitute ( Randall Edwards ) , less for pleasure than as a rite of passage , then rediscovers his innocence in the chaste embrace of a Catholic schoolgirl . He confronts the chasm between his diary jottings and literature . In perhaps his least anticipated experience , he meets an age mate smarter than he is , not only in literary learning but in his grasp of human nature . <P> In contrast to the confident , even cocky kid of Brighton Beach , the Eugene of Biloxi Blues knows how little he knows . He is aware enough of the larger world to realize how many perils , including the war , may bar his path to glory . And through the nudging of his wise and principled friend Arnold Epstein ( played with ferocious wit by Barry Miller ) , Eugene begins to grasp that his charm and amiability may mask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being " a witness , " devoid of passion and commitment , the insight may make an audience reconsider its feelings about the character and also its author , who appears to be musing self-critically about three decades of often bland ingratiation on Broadway , in Hollywood and on TV . <P> Nonetheless , the jokes keep on coming . Titters resound even in what are meant to be grim moments : the exposure and imprisonment of one of Eugene 's barracks mates as a homosexual ; a nervy confrontation between a drunk drill sergeant wielding a loaded pistol and a raw recruit whom the officer despises . The detached Eugene , moreover , proves Arnold 's attack true by being offstage during these scenes ; he is so passive that the viewer may long for a play that focuses more on Arnold . Inevitably , the sequel lacks some of the roundedness and universality of Brighton Beach : a military stopover can not encompass the complex , cumulative relationships of a family . Still , it stands with the most telling statements of the World War II generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , about how much of life is luck . After a fall and winter of disappointment , Biloxi Blues ranks as the best new American play of the Broadway season .
