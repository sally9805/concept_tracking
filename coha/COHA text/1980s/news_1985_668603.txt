Molly Moppett is a year-old black and white domestic long-haired cat that may be on the verge of glory . She will be competing in the Household Pet Division at the Lincoln State Cat Club 25th Annual Championship and Household Pet Cat Show Saturday and Sunday in Villa Park . To see her now , it ' s easy to assume her life always has been one of custom-sewn catnip mice and tuna-and-liver puff surprise under glass . Her coat is as gorgeous as those on the celebrities in the " what becomes a legend most " magazine ads ; her celery-green eyes shine with health and the confidence that she has people who love her . But 11 months ago , our cover cat nearly was food for the fishes herself . Two boys fishing under a bridge along the Kishwaukee River near Rockford last March saw the kitten  --  thrown from a moving car  --  sail over the abutment 25 feet above them and splash into the water below . The Kishwaukee River has a swift undercurrent , so the boys knew they couldn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would learn she was less than six weeks old , a small scrap of life about to end unless they could think of something fast . Using the only thing they had at hand , their fishing equipment , they began casting for the kitten . One boy ' s cast hooked her in the lip , and though the flesh tore , he managed to pull her to shore . The boys quickly carried the pathetic creature home to their mother , who took it to a veterinarian . Eventually , the kitten ended up in Noah ' s Ark Shelter in Rockford , where Barbara Boon does volunteer work . The kitten needed medication three times a day . Part of her left lip was missing and it would remain raw for six weeks . She also had come down with a respiratory infection . " When you ran your hands down her body , all you could feel were bones and scabs , " said Mrs. Boon . The scabs were suspicious , caused by no obvious physiological problem . Opening her mouth to put in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front baby teeth were gone . " Somebody had kicked out her teeth , " she said . " She had a terrible time eating , " said her husband , Dan Boon . " She still does ' t like to be petted under the mouth . " He obviously is one of Molly ' s favorite people , as her place of choice is curled up contentedly against his chest as she hears her story  --  with its happy ending  --  told . Nevertheless , " even after all she ' d been through , the minute I picked her up , she started purring , " says Mrs. Boon . Molly not only is unafraid of people , she is confident and patient in a situation which would have most cats hiding under a chair  --  posing for the cover shot in a professional studio where a lot of strange activity occurs . She eventually became " the mommy of the bunch " in the Boon household . " Anything smaller has to have a bath immediately , " said Mrs. Boon . At the age of 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She competed from the age of 4 to 8 months in the Household Pet kitten classes of American Cat Fanciers Assn. shows . " She ' s done so well , " said Mrs. Boon . " She ' s top of the line . She ' s got more ribbons and trophies than we know what to do with . She took No. 1 Kitten in the U.S. and Canada , including a Best of the Best award . " The Cat Fanciers ' Association , unlike the American Cat Fanciers Assn. , offers no kitten classes in Household Pet , so when Molly Moppett goes to Lincoln State this weekend , it will be her first time against CFA-registered cats . Because she is a dainty , feminine cat , competition will be tough for Molly , as CFA judges  --  it is said  --  tend to prefer huge " barn cat " types for Household Pet winner . It also is the big time , as over the years the Lincoln State show  --  the largest in this area  --  has attracted entries from across the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes at a show such as Lincoln State are fascinating to spectators for the variety of spectacular , often exotic , pampered feline beauty to be seen  --  from Charmin-soft fluffy Himalayans to the marcelled-look curly-coated Rex . " These cats are competing for Best in Show awards which may lead ultimately to national awards given annually by the parent association , " said Judith Kethley , show manager . " The Household Pet classes , while more local in nature , have always been very exciting for owners and spectators alike . The competition is no less keen , " said Kethley . Also , the devotion of the owners for these pet cats is a palpable , touching thing to witness and adds greatly to show-ring excitement . " They compete for their own Best in Show and the winners are usually the happiest exhibitors in the show hall , " added Kethley . Often , sheer numbers of entries are high , making it a rough task for a judge to pick a winner out of so many , " each one of which thinks he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one judge put it . The Boons have a large number of cats at home in their Misfits-Fit Cattery and show eight of them in Household Pet , but Molly Moppett is their rising starlet . " There are three qualifications , " said Mr. Boon , " the coat , the condition of the animal , and its personality and how it gets along with people . " If the cat is obviously out of its element , it won ' t get disqualified . But if you want a consistent winner , it helps if the cat does something to draw the attention of the judge  --  lie down and roll over , rub its head against him , anything unusual . " When Molly gets up there in the judge ' s cage , she ' s batting the number ( on the outside of the cage ) , she ' s turning over , she ' s doing everything to say , ' Judge , here I am . ' She is a very big ham . She likes the attention . " Quite often , judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special event by asking owners of the top 10 finalists or so to come up before the audience , say something about their cats and where and how the bonding process between them occurred . While Molly Moppett ' s story is a dramatic one , it is surprising how many similar " rats to riches " stories there are among Household Pet contestants . Often , if one is observant , a sniff or two is audible in the audience and an eye or two is seen being dabbed as a young girl tells how her kitten was found starving in an abandoned building , rummaging through dusty garbage cans . All the while , the cat is in her arms , giving her nuzzling kisses on her cheek , purring . What : Lincoln State Cat Club Annual Championship and Household Pet Cat Show Where : The Odeum , 1033 N.
