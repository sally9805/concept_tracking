With Gramm-Rudman behind , President Reagan is pulling out all stops to round up Republican support for the tax-overhaul bill shaped by the Democrats . After a hectic weekend of phone calls and public pleading , the President is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill today for a meeting with House Republicans. // Last-ditch White House maneuvering could still recover the fumbled ball for the President , following the politically embarrassing defeat for the measure last week . Frustrated by the lack of White House consideration for their concerns and poor political liaison , the vast majority of GOP lawmakers defiantly refused to allow the Democratic bill to come to the House floor for debate and a vote. // // A second rejection of a rule vote by House Republicans would be a political blow to the President , pointing to his declining influence with the Congress in his second term and adding to talk of a ' ' lame duck ' ' presidency. // But Mr. Reagan has so often landed on his feet after an ostensible setback that political observers have learned not to underestimate his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains a question how important tax reform is to the American people . The issue has not generated a surge of support , despite a strong pitch for reform made by the President during his travels around the country . Some political analysts see little political damage to the President even if tax reform fails. // ' ' If tax reform goes down the tube , citizens won ' t care , ' ' says election expert Richard Scammon . ' ' There was never a groundswell of demand for it , and the consequences of not winning can not be disastrous . It ' s mostly yak-yak talk inside the ( Washington ) Beltway. ' ' // But other observers suggest that attitudes in official Washington help shape public opinion at large . A defeat on tax reform would therefore be perceived as a loss of presidential influence in Congress. // Looking to 1988 , it could also reinforce the impression among many voters that the Republicans are the party of the rich . This is an image Reagan seeks to alter by backing tax relief for the poor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Democrats seek ) . // White House aides are now banking on lining up enough Republican support to win a vote on a new procedural resolution that would clear the way for consideration of the measure . A senior White House official says he still expects House passage of the bill , which would then go to the Senate to be taken up early next year. // The challenge for Reagan is to pick up GOP support without losing any Democrats . Rep. Dan Rostenkowski ( D ) of Illinois , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , says the task is doable . If Reagan gets down in the trenches and uses the full force of the presidency , Mr. Rostenkowski said on ABC-TV ' s ' ' This Week with David Brinkley ' ' Sunday , he should be able gain more than the 50 votes needed to pass a rule bill. // In return for their votes , Republican legislators are seeking some changes that the House Ways and Means Committee rejected in its plan , as well as assurances from Reagan that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain GOP provisions . Rep. Richard Cheney ( R ) of Wyoming , chairman of the Republican Policy Committee , said Sunday that he would not change his position against the tax-reform measure and that the President ought to work with the Republicans for a better bill instead of relying on the Senate to improve it. // While tax-code overhaul is on the line this week , the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing bill has left more questions than it has answered . President Reagan conspicuously avoided a splashy ceremony when he signed the controversial legislation last week . That reflects the political and economic uncertainty that surrounds the measure. // Republicans and Democrats will claim political advantages in Gramm-Rudman. // On the face of it , it is a plus for the Republicans , who have managed to turn attention away from the national debt , which has doubled under the Reagan administration . The public may now be left with the perception that something has been done about skyrocketing deficits , thus letting Reagan off the hook for huge deficits caused by his economic policies. // ' ' The Republicans were trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with having increased the debt limit , so it was a masterful shifting to Gramm-Rudman , ' ' says Charles Jones , a congressional expert at the University of Virginia . ' ' No one heard about the debt limit again. ' ' // The Gramm-Rudman plan , which aims at a balanced budget by 1991 , also serves Reagan ' s primary domestic goal of scaling back federal spending . Under the measure , failure of Congress to arrive at the mandated deficit targets will automatically trigger presidential cuts in defense and domestic programs. // But the Democrats see Gramm-Rudman forcing such deep and unpalatable reductions in defense spending that the President will finally come around to proposing a ' ' last resort ' ' tax increase . ' ' Democrats have gone along with Gramm-Rudman because they perceive an advantage , ' ' says another budget expert Allen Shick . ' ' They ' re not going to cave in on domestic priorities. ' ' // Even the administration is queasy about the quixotic Gramm-Rudman plan , as indicated by the decision not to highlight Reagan ' s signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mentioning the constitutional questions still to be resolved. // Although no one is yet sure how the bill will work , Gramm-Rudman is expected to set up a confrontation between the President and Congress as Democratic and even Republican lawmakers battle to keep programs their constituents favor , and the President fights to keep his defense programs intact. // Public-opinion analysts say the budget deficit never had political teeth in the 1984 campaign and it is still an abstraction to most people. // ' ' I never saw much political power in the budget deficit , ' ' says Andrew Kohut , president of the Gallup polling organization . ' ' And now that something has been done , people can put it in the back of their mind. ' ' // // // // //
