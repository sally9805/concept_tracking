Some facts are not in dispute : a group of white youths at a party , hearing that three blacks were walking through their community , chased and beat them with a baseball bat , a tree limb and fists . One victim , Michael Griffith , a 23-year-old construction worker , was killed by a car as he fled across a busy highway. // But as the investigation of the case has unfolded , gaps and contraditions have emerged , leaving elements of mystery and doubt over many of the things that happened on the night of Dec. 19-20 and in the tense aftermath of the episode. // Some questions involve the roles of the assailants , including three white teen-agers charged with second-degree murder , and of the motorist whose car killed Mr. Griffith . Others pertain to the victims . Still others arise from apparent contradictions in accounts by the police and by witnesses. // // Apparent Contradictions // The contradictions seemed to multiply on Friday when Alton H. Maddox Jr. , a lawyer for Cedric Sandiford , one of the black victims , charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participant in the attack and that the authorities were ignoring this . He also accused the police of having ignored a menacing white crowd just before the attack began. // Mr. Maddox warned that Mr. Sandiford would not cooperate with the prosecution unless the motorist , Dominick Blum , a 24-year-old Family Court officer , was charged along with the other white youths . The police , providing a detailed account of Mr. Blum ' s movements , have said he was not an accomplice. // While Mr. Maddox did not offer details to support his allegations , his threat to withhold the cooperation of the principal witness cast doubt on the ability of the Queens District Attorney to prosecute the case , which has prompted demonstrations against racism and a debate over the state of race relations in the city. // The ultimate question perhaps - one that might be answered only by a jury in a trial - was the extent to which the blacks believed they were still being pursued when Mr. Griffith was struck and killed . On that point , an investigator shed some light yesterday. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the blacks had watched through a fence from a distance as Mr. Griffith was struck and killed on the Shore Parkway near Cross Bay Boulevard shortly after 1 A.M. on Dec. 20. // They had beaten Mr. Griffith and Mr. Sandiford in a grassy area beside a fence running along the parkway , the investigator said . The two blacks fled through a three-foot hole in the fence , the police said , but the whites did not go through the hole in pursuit of them. // While only 3 white youths have been charged in the case , 11 have been interrogated , and one major unanswered question was how many of them participated in the beatings , which began outside the New Park Pizzeria at Cross Bay Boulevard and 157th Avenue and , after an eight-block chase on foot and by car , continued at the fence near 156th Avenue and 86th Street . <> <> Allegations About Blum // Mr. Maddox charged that the police " knew from Mr. Sandiford that that the auto involved in the rundown of Michael Griffith was also the automobile involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were found . " He said Mr. Sandiford had told the police that Mr. Blum " was the one who intentionally murdered Michael Griffith by coming up the highway and running him down. " // The lawyer also charged that police officers who went to the pizzeria in response to a call about " three suspicious blacks " had left with the blacks as a menacing crowd of white youths gathered to confront them. // The police , contradicting these assertions , said the officers had left the pizzeria 5 to 10 minutes before the blacks and had not seen any white youths. // The police also said Mr. Sandiford had told them that he did not witness the crash , though he may have heard it . They quoted him as having said he saw a dark car involved in the chase a second time , on the parkway , but he did not contend that that was the car the struck Mr. Griffith . <> <> Simulated Gun Found // Mr. Sandiford , who had fled west along the Shore Parkway - the opposite direction from that taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a mile from the scene of the fatal crash . He had been seen by a motorist who alerted the police. // Other unanswered questions involve the ownership of a simulated gun found near Mr. Griffith ' s body and the purpose of an electronic paging device that belonged to him and was also found near his body . He was found slumped near the center divider of the six-lane highway a few blocks west of Cross Bay Boulevard. // Some questions involving the victims and their conduct remained . For example , why did Timothy Grimes , 20 , the third man who was attacked , leave the scene after being struck once , hitchhike home to Brooklyn and never call the police ? // There have also been contradictory accounts about what the black men were doing in Howard Beach when they were attacked , though the police have emphasized repeatedly that there was no evidence that they had done anything wrong or intended to do anything wrong . <> <> Conflicting Reports // Contrary to numerous previous reports , the blacks were not seeking help for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Rather , investigators now say , they had abandoned the car and its driver - a cousin of Mr. Griffith visiting from Florida - on Cross Bay Boulevard near Far Rockaway , three miles south of Howard Beach. // The car , a 1976 Buick , which had broken down in an isolated section , was towed by a private tow truck to an auto-repair shop on Beach Channel Drive on the Rockaway Peninsula , south of Howard Beach , the police reported Wednesday . Officials in the Queens District Attorney ' s office said the car had a defective transmission. // A law enforcement official said last night that though Mr. Blum ' s car was being viewed as evidence relevant to the case , the disabled car was not because it did not relate to the beatings administered to the three blacks and the subsequent death of one of them. // " Nothing is going to be learned from a forensic examination of that car relevant to the crimes , " the official said. // In the original police version of what happened , an account issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three blacks were said to have walked three miles up the boulevard and into Howard Beach in search of help for their disabled car. // Later that day , in a news conference , Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said the three had been walking to the Rockaway Boulevard subway station at Rockaway Boulevard , Liberty Avenue , and Cross Bay Boulevard , a mile north of the scene of the attack , to go to their homes in Brooklyn. // The Howard Beach station at 159th Avenue and 103d Street was closer to the pizzeria but they may not have known about it because it is about 10 blocks to the east of Cross Bay Boulevard and separated from the boulevard for some distance by Shell Bank Basin . He said the black men had not , as previously reported , asked to use the telephone at the pizzeria , but had asked for the location of the nearest subway. // An investigator said the black men had told the police they were on their way to Far Rockaway so Mr. Griffith could pick up a paycheck from a contractor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unable to determine who employed them and so have been unable to verify this . Mr. Grimes was said to be unemployed. // While investigators do not believe that Mr. Blum was an accomplice of the assailants , they said they were skeptical of some elements of his account of the fatal crash. // Among other things , they question his contention that he thought he had hit a tire or an animal in the roadway . Mr. Griffith was standing up in the westbound lanes when struck , they said , and was hurled up onto the hood and shattered the windshield of Mr. Blum ' s 1979 blue Dodge Aspen. // " It ' s a questionable story , " one investigator said . " We don ' t think he was connected to the assailants , but it ' s hard to believe he thought he hit a tire . " <> <> Could Still Be Charged // Mr. Blum - who drove away after the accident and returned an hour later with his father , a police officer , in another car - was not charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case would be presented to a grand jury and that the motorist still might be charged. // Mr. Maddox charged Friday that Mr. Blum had been a willing participant in the attack . He charged that his client had made this known to the police and that the police had failed to act on it. // But the police said their investigation , while raising doubts about Mr. Blum ' s conduct after the accident , indicated that he was not an accomplice of - nor even acquainted with - the three white youths who have been charged with second-degree murder in the case. // The investigators said Mr. Blum had attended a play at Brooklyn College on the evening of Dec. 19 with his girlfriend , Martine Citannon , his parents , and another couple. // The names of the couple that Mr. Blum dropped off in Flushing have not been released. // His parents , with whom he resides , returned alone to their home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn , the investigators said , and Mr. Blum dropped off the other couple at their homes in Flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were returning to Brooklyn that the accident occurred , the investigators said . They said there was no evidence to support Mr. Maddox ' s contention that Mr. Blum had been at the pizzeria. // After Mr. Blum returned to the accident scene , investigators said , the police erroneously assumed that it was his father ' s undamaged car he had been riding in when he thought he hit a tire or an animal. // It was not until the next day , when he was questioned and instructed to bring the car to the police station , that the police learned that he had been riding in his own car , which was heavily damaged , and that Ms. Citannon had been with him . She was questioned , but the police said she had been asleep at the time of the crash and knew nothing about it . <> <> No Sign of Car // Mr. Blum could not be reached yesterday at his home , a narrow , two-story single-family house on East 36th Street in Flatbush , and there was no sign of the car he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impounded , the police said , because the driver conceded involvement and detectives took photographs , scrapings and other forensic evidence before releasing it to Mr. Blum. // Paul Blum , the motorist ' s father , declined to comment on the case , and his wife and daughter , Theresa , said Dominick no longer lived in the house . Neighbors said Dominick had not been seen since the accident. //
