Officials at G.D . Searle must have watched with concern three years ago when a raft of lawsuits forced bankruptcy on A.H . Robins , maker of the Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth-control device . With good reason : from 1974 to 1986 Searle sold in the U.S. the Copper-7 , an IUD that , like the Dalkon Shield , has been suspected of causing serious illnesses or injuries in some users . <P> While Searle has won 14 of 17 Copper-7 court cases that went to a jury , things are not looking so good for an upcoming trial in St. Paul . The plaintiff , Esther Kociemba of Elk River , Minn. , claims that the Copper-7 gave her pelvic inflammatory disease , which left her sterile . Internal Searle documents released by court order suggest that the company knew of physicians ' safety concerns about the Copper-7 but kept on selling it . In a 1980 memo , a Searle doctor warned company officials that " all studies with which I am familiar conclude that all IUDs enhance the potential for PID . " <P> Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IUDs were sold in the U.S. , and if Kociemba wins her case , many more of the women who have used the Copper-7 may be encouraged to sue . Nonetheless , the company remains confident of avoiding a Robins-style disaster . Says Spokeswoman Kay Bruno : " Our product does n't cause the problems alleged . "
