Visibly ailing since Memorial Day , Austin 's historic Treaty Oak  --  alleged site of a treaty signing by Native Americans and Father of Texas Stephen F. Austin  --  has been receiving the kind of diligent attention usually given a gravely ill head of state . A team of eleven has meticulously removed the contaminated soil from around its huge root network , and last week billionaire H. Ross Perot flew in 18 technical specialists from around the nation to assist in a bedside diagnosis . <P> About 600 years old and 50 ft. high , the great tree , with its 52 1/2-in. girth and 127-ft. limb spread , has inspired an outpouring of sympathy . Well- wishers stand vigil , send get-well cards , flowers , candles , even cans of chicken soup with anguished messages : " Please do n't die ! " <P> It seems that someone poured the potent herbicide Velpar in a circle around the tree early this year , committing a " malicious act against an innocent creature , " said city forester John Giedraitis . When the tree shed beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tree is under a tremendous amount of stress . " Velpar maker Du Pont has put up a $10,000 reward for the capture of the tree 's poisoner . Says a poster at the tree : HANG HIM FROM THE HIGHEST LIMB . <P> Police late last week arrested Paul Stedman Cullen , 45 , and said he apparently poisoned the tree as part of a ritual . Hanging , though , is not in prospect . Cullen could get only up to 20 years for criminal mischief , a felony.
