You do n't see many trailers like Steve Badanes ' 1956 silver Airstream anymore . Round and compact , it is one of those sleek design achievements of the 1950s that can make people nostalgic for tackiness . Badanes even travels with a plastic pink flamingo that he props outside the door wherever he parks . Most recently , the trailer  --  and flamingo  --  was parked in a wooded lot of a wealthy northern Virginia suburb while serving as home for Badanes , his itinerant opera-singing girlfriend Donna Walter , and their dog Floyd Bite ( after Frank Lloyd Wright ) . But if a tacky trailer in an expensive Colonial suburb seems a little out of place to you , consider what Badanes and his three colleagues , architect-builders who call themselves the Jersey Devil , were constructing on the same lot : a multimillion-dollar house that 's shaped like an overgrown hero sandwich . <P> " We did n't set out to make it look like a hoagie , " says Badanes , appearing only slightly guilty about it all . " It just sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit it 's kind of ironic . The guy 's a heart surgeon , and we go and build him a house that looks like a cholesterol lunch . " <P> Badanes clearly enjoys the joke . In fact , such irreverence is his group 's trademark . Born at Princeton University during the counterculture days of the 1960s , the Jersey Devil is a traveling band of renegade architects who rejected standard careers to design the really far out and then , in an even more radical break with modern architectural practice , get out the saws , hammers and nails and build these unusual structures themselves . Since their first project , a child 's play structure built to resemble an enormous cockroach , they 've painstakingly assembled twelve houses , from San Francisco to New Hampshire , parking tents , trailers or makeshift cardboard homes on site so they could live there as they worked , encouraging clients to pick up hammers and join them on weekends , and throwing parties in partly built houses to celebrate the completion of a foundation or their topping off of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its name from a mythical creature said to threaten people in New Jersey 's Pine Barrens , is no ordinary architectural firm . But do n't get them wrong . Badanes , Jim Adamson , Greg Torchio and John Ringel are serious about what they do , and say it is in the best tradition of the American pioneer spirit . <P> " When all of us went to architecture school , we thought being an architect had something to do with building , " says Badanes , 43 , while sitting with the others in the Jersey Devil office trailer parked just opposite his Airstream . " But most architects these days sit in their offices , design their places down to the last details and then hand the plans over to be built by someone else . Now I ask you , which approach do you think would make for better results ? Do you sit in your office and look up stock answers in your books ? Or do you move to the guy 's property , immerse yourself in that piece of land , take your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early days , that 's how buildings were made . Where did we go wrong ?
