In the early decades of the 20th century , farmers had few pesticides at their disposal more effective than arsenates to protect their crops from insect depredations . During World War II , German and Allied laboratories produced complex and lethal chemical compounds , including DDT and lindane . Since then new generations of pesticides such as carbamates ( Bux Ten , Furadan and Mobam ) have proved to be efficient at curbing insects and microscopic pests without producing the strong toxic effects of DDT on the environment . At the same time , however , these new silent killers still pose a potential threat to other forms of life , including human . <P> Last week 's disaster in Bhopal focused world attention on two highly volatile and toxic gases , methyl isocyanate and phosgene . They , along with many other chemicals , are used in the production of pesticides . Methyl isocyanate ( MIC ) helps produce Union Carbide 's Temik , a product marketed under Robert Gordon Haines , the company 's manager for new pesticides . It is one of a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in turn , is used to make paint and varnish . The MIC compound also has been made in the U.S. at Union Carbide 's plant in Institute , W. Va. , as well as by other companies in West Germany , Japan and South Korea . <P> MIC reacts quickly with water , and can easily be absorbed through the skin or inhaled . It causes moist human tissues like lung interiors to swell and the eyes to develop cataracts . Victims can suffocate because MIC causes the lungs to fill with fluid , and they can suffer liver damage and burning of the nasal passages , throat and trachea . <P> Phosgene , synthesized early in the 19th century and also known as carbonyl chloride , is a colorless , highly toxic gas . It is used to make chemicals like MIC , as well as dyes and resins . Phosgene first gained infamy during World War I , when the Germans used it alone or with chlorine in deadly gas attacks . Later , the gas came to be widely used in the manufacture of pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on humans are well known . Inhalation causes severe lung injury , but since the gas has no effect on the upper respiratory tract , victims have no immediate warning , other than a musty odor , that they have breathed in a poisonous gas . Choking is usually the first symptom . Then the lungs eventually fill with fluid and asphyxiation occurs . In most cases of moderate exposure to MIC , the effects are treatable . Even small doses of phosgene , however , can be lethal .
