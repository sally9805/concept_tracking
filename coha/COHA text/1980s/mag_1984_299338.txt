THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION <P> Directed by W.D . Richter ; Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch <P> What is this movie anyway ? Only the first sci-fi western action adventure rock-'n ' - roll melodrama farce . Only Star Wars , The Magnificent Seven , The War of the Worlds , The Right Stuff , Strange Invaders , Eddie and the Cruisers and Plan 9 from Outer Space mixed and mismatched as if by a mad scientist in his Late Show lab . And its Japanese-American hero ? He is only the avatar of Han Solo , A. J. Foyt , J. Robert Oppenheimer , Christiaan Barnard , Bruce Lee and Bruce Springsteen . A state-of-the-art spaceship flying at the speed of light without narrative coordinates , Buckaroo Banzai is the very oddest good movie in many a full moon . <P> A feeble attempt must be made to synopsize the film 's hallucinogenic plot . In 1938 Orson Welles scared his radio fans with a show about aliens landing in Grovers Mill , N.J. Buckaroo Banzai proposes that the invasion was for real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the distant Planet 10 , who took on human form while searching for the technology needed to destroy the earth and launch them back to do intergalactic evil . Now the technology , an Oscillation Overthruster , is just beyond their grasp : in the hands of our hero , who discovered it while traveling through solid rock and into the eighth dimension . <P> And so a ferocious battle of wits ensues . On one side : Buckaroo ( Peter Weller ) and the members of Team Banzai . On the other : Dr. Emilio Lizardo ( John Lithgow ) , once a brilliant physicist , now the vilest , battiest extraterrestrial in all the genre . Meanwhile , the benevolent rulers of Planet 10 hover above New Jersey in a craft that looks like the Mollusk from Outer Space , dispensing wisdom and even more confusion . Where will it lead ? Most likely to nuclear annihilation . Already the President of the U.S. is opening a dread , eyes-only packet that reads DECLARATION OF WAR : THE SHORT FORM . <P> <P> The plot , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside , the alert viewer will find humor , imagination and a little Oriental mysticism . ( Buckaroo 's slogan , " No matter where you go , there you are , " could serve as a fortune-cookie credo for the no-problem ' 80s . ) There is also a passel of sharp performances . The presence of such actors as Christopher Lloyd ( Zenned-out on an inner voice that must sound like Daffy Duck 's ) , Ellen Barkin ( with her bruised features and street-angel smile ) and Jeff Goldblum ( heartthrob of the Mensa sorority ) clues Buckaroo Banzai as very chic scifi . Lithgow , the movies ' Mr. Versatile ( transsexual jock in The World According to Garp , bumbling lover in Terms of Endearment , incendiary preacher in Footloose ) , here does a manic turn as Dr. Lizardo ; it is as if old mad Ezra Pound were played by Klaus Kinski . And Weller-his cobalt eyes borrowed from Paul Newman , his iron jaw from D.C. Comics-makes a stalwart Renaissance man for the atomic age .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
