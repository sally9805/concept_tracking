Mr. Mondale acted two days after announcing that he would terminate all such committees but would not return the money they had raised . On Thursday he had told reporters that it was all right for the groups to keep the money , which came largely from organized labor. // Mr. Mondale said that , because of questions raised about the finances of the delegate committees , the money the groups had spent in behalf of the Mondale candidacy would be counted toward his $20. 2 million Federal limit on spending in the nomination battle. // // // Questions About Independence // // The groups were set up to be independent of the Mondale campaign as it began facing a financial squeeze in January that threatened to push the campaign up to the Federal spending limit in the spring , at a time of critical primaries and caucuses . Senator Gary Hart has said the committees were aligned with the Mondale campaign and thus illegal. // In Nashville , Senator Hart said he was pleased with Mr. Mondale ' s decision but that many questions still remained about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Louisiana , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , also praised the decision. // In his unexpected announcement today , Mr. Mondale said that because Federal elections laws were " not well- defined " and were " ambiguous , " he wanted " to resolve this matter and remove any lingering doubts " about the financing of his campaign. // " I believe that public servants , including myself , have a duty not just to avoid improprieties but to avoid the appearance of impropriety , " Mr. Mondale told a news conference here after a picnic at the Lubbock Civic Center. // Mr. Mondale added , " The blurred standards governing delegate committees lead me to direct my campaign to take additional steps. " // He said his campaign would inform the Federal Election Commission that " we will refund all contributions made to delegate committees which would not have been been acceptable if made to the campaign directly. " // Maxine Isaacs , Mr. Mondale ' s press secretary in Washington , said in a telephone interview that the $300 , 000 estimate of what would be returned included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as any contributions in excess of $1 , 000 made by individuals. // Mr. Mondale and Mr. Hart have both vowed not to accept PAC money . A contested Federal law bars individuals from giving more than $1 , 000 to a Presidential campaign , and PAC ' s from giving more than $5 , 000 . But some contributors are giving the maximum amount to each of many states ' delegate committees . Mondale aides said they did not have an estimate on the total of any such contributions . <> <> A Sudden Change of Mind // // On Wednesday , Mr. Mondale ordered the termination of all 127 delegate committees . This prompted Senator Hart to say Mr. Mondale should " take one simple cleansing step " and return the labor money gathered by the committees . Mr. Jackson made similar comments. // Although Mr. Mondale told reporters Thursday that he would not return the money because the committees were " autonomous " and " legal , " aides said Mr. Mondale changed his mind Thursday night after a three-hour discussion with them in his motel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington ; David Ifshin , his campaign ' s general counsel ; Lynn Oliphant , deputy general counsel , and Michael Berman , a lawyer and the campaign treasurer .

" He was disturbed about all the implications that were being raised . He kept saying , ' I ' m not in this to win lawsuits . I ' m in the business of getting elected President . ' " <> <> Groups ' Legally Defensible ' // // Mr. Hart , in a complaint to the Federal Election Commission , had said the committees were set up illegally by the Mondale organization to avoid campaign laws and to pour " hundreds of thousands of political action committee " money into the campaign through the supposedly independent grass-roots delegate groups. // Although there had been growing evidence linking the Mondale organization to the committees , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " operating on their own " and that his campaign had not " been involved with them. " // Mr. Mondale said his lawyers told him that the committees were " legally defensible . " But he said , " It ' s far more important to me to make clear my deep committment to ethical performance than to lose what ethical advantage that money difference will make. " // Mr. Mondale said his delegate committees would lose their independent status and be directly " affiliated with our campaign . " This move places the delegate groups under the spending guidelines of the Federal Election Commission . <> <> Refund of PAC Money // // " We will refund all contributions made to delegate committees which would not have been acceptable if made to the campaign directly , including PAC contributions and individual contributions that would exceed campaign limits , " Mr. Mondale said , referring to the $1 , 000 individual limit. // He added that , with the committees placed under the wing of the Mondale organization , " we will count all the expenditures of all delegate committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondale aides said the delegate committees had raised an estimated $500 , 000 and had spent most of that. // Miss Isaacs , the press secretary , said contributions of about $200 , 000 were not being returned because they had been deemed legal and in compliance with Federal election laws. // She said the Mondale campaign had so far spent about $14. 8 million of the $20. 2 million campaign limit . Mondale aides said this did not include the money spent by the delegate groups. // Mr. Mondale , in his comments today , emphasized the ambiguity of Federal election laws dealing with the committees . Delegate committees were first allowed in 1976 in an effort to spur grass-roots and local activities for Presidential candidates. // " I hope the F.E.C. will recognize the ambiguities that exist on the subject of the delegate committees , and will either act to obtain their abolition or promulgate specific standards to govern their operation , " Mr. Mondale said . <> <> Hart Says He ' s Pleased // // // // NASHVILLE , April 27 - Senator Gary Hart said today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s decision to return the money raised by the delegate committees , but that many questions still remained. // Interrupting the taping of a 30- minute campaign advertisement here to respond to Mr. Mondale ' s decision , said the labor donations have produced " tainted victories " for Mr. Mondale in primaries in New York , Illinois and Pennsylvania and caucuses in Wisconsin . In these states , Mr. Hart said , Mondale forces were aided by funds from the political action committees. // Mr. Hart also questioned whether Mr. Mondale would have made the decision " on his own without public pressure and without the scrutiny " of recent weeks . <> <> Jackson Praises Decision // // NATCHITOCHES , La . , April 27 - The Rev.
