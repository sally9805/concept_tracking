In public education , geography has long been destiny . Crippled by limited staffs and tight budgets , rural districts have often found it impossible to offer courses such as Russian and physics that are considered standard by their more cosmopolitan counterparts . Now all that is changing , thanks to the arrival of the electronic classroom . By using interactive video , even small , disadvantaged schools are gaining access to the most sophisticated instruction available , and all without losing the human touch . <P> The formats and course offerings are as varied as the sponsors , which include federal and state governments , universities , public-television stations and commercial networks . Unlike Whittle Communications ' Channel One , however , which beams news and ads into schools on regular television , the electronic classroom enables instructors and pupils to hear and interact with one another much as they would in any normal setting . But the visuals are still one-way : students can see the teacher , but not vice versa . <P> Televised courses can be a bargain for financially strapped schools . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish , cordless phones and the electronic keypads or computer terminals needed for students to communicate with their long-distance teachers . That one-time outlay amounts to far less than a conventional teacher 's annual salary . Like network anchors , video teachers submit to screen tests and often conduct their classes without a studio audience . <P> The tele-classroom has been especially valuable in states with small populations and struggling economies . Last year , when 15 of the 28 students at Maine 's Allagash High School protested the dearth of humanities courses , the University of Maine decided to fill the gap . This fall the university will offer more than 20 courses , including elementary French and algebra , to 23 Maine schools . <P> Other states are scrambling to enter the video age . Last January the Kentucky Education Network began beaming **26;7871;TOOLONG classes into 65 far-flung high schools . By September Virginia expects to have earth stations at every one of its 289 high schools . Private networks , such as the Texas-based TI-IN Network , go even further , sending instruction to more than 750 school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long-distance learning . Ninth-grader Vanessa Bryan , one of only 700 residents on Ocracoke Island , N.C. , could not have taken Spanish if her school had not tapped into the TI-IN Network . Now she and " classmates " in 18 schools across the country receive instruction from a teacher based in a San Antonio studio . They accept TV tutelage as routine . Says Vanessa : " It 's a good course . " <P> Some public school administrators are concerned , however , that the new technology will erode their control . Principals have little leverage over teachers who live hundreds of miles away and do not teach exclusively in one district . Adolescent daydreaming carries less of a penalty when students know they can view a lesson on tape . " We do n't play the typical games , " says David Benke , who teaches computer science to pupils from San Isidro , Texas , and Prescott , Iowa . " You 've got to have a student who really wants to learn . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
