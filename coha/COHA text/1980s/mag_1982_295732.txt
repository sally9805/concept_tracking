Yearning for Calm and Stability Mubarak is not , and does not want to be , another Sadat <P> It is a show trial , the largest in Egypt 's modern history . The makeshift courtroom is an exhibition hall at the Cairo fairgrounds , where 280 prisoners are on display in huge steel cages . Another 20 defendants are still at large , and two have died in prison . Most of the prisoners are accused of being members of a Muslim fundamentalist group known as al Jihad ( Holy War ) , and many are linked with the violence that broke out in the Upper Egyptian city of Asyut following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat on Oct. 6 , 1981 . Nineteen of the defendants were among those sentenced last March in the Sadat murder trial . The charges this time , for which all but three of the prisoners face the death penalty : plotting Islamic revolution . During one recess in the proceedings , a bearded , white-robed defendant shouted , " This regime is forgetting the fate of the stupid Anwar Sadat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial of the Muslim fanatics , which may continue for months , underscores the severity of the problems facing Hosni Mubarak , the taciturn former air force commander who became President when Sadat was slain . Largely because of the threat of Muslim extremists , the People 's Assembly has extended the state of emergency for another year at Mubarak 's request , giving security forces more power to arrest and detain suspects . But while he strives to maintain order at home , Mubarak is also caught up in a wide range of complex diplomatic questions . He must uphold the strong commitments that Sadat made to the U.S. , to Israel and to the Camp David accords . Yet he must also register his disapproval of Israel 's war in Lebanon and of what he sees as Washington 's inability to control the Israelis , even as he strives to repair the ties with the Arab world that Sadat sacrificed in the cause of peace . <P> Even more urgent for Mubarak is the problem of the Egyptian economy . Most of Egypt 's 45 million people live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not keep pace with population growth , currently 3% a year . All Egyptians benefit from government price subsidies on food and other basic commodities . But these subsidies are strangling the economy because they consume 31% of the national budget . Any effort to reform the subsidy program is a risky business , as Sadat learned during the 1977 food riots . <P> Severely restricted in what he can do , Mubarak has moved slowly . " Do n't expect miracles from me , " he has warned . " I have no magic wand . " He has shuffled his finance and economic ministers . He has raised interest rates on savings and hiked taxes on most imports . He has reassessed Sadat 's policy of al infitah ( the opening ) , under which the country has attempted to lure foreign investors . Launched in the mid-1970s , al infitah produced some investment in luxury hotels and soft-drink plants , but did little to expand Egypt 's industrial base .                  @ @ @
