Sad news from Paris the other day : they have abolished the carte pneumatique , otherwise known as the pneu , an institution that dates back to the empire of Napoleon III . For those who did not spend some of their youth in Paris and therefore do not know about the pneu , it was a letter on gray paper that whizzed through a 269-mile network of pneumatic tubes and then was delivered by a mailman on a bicycle . Faster than an ordinary letter ( it took about two hours ) but cheaper ( $1.80 ) than a telegram , the pneu provided a valuable service at the moveable feast of the Left Bank , where very few hotel rooms had private telephones . By the pneu , you learned of a job found , a crisis solved , a date confirmed-or broken . " Ca n't make dinner tonight . How about Wednesday ? " That kind of thing . <P> According to the French postal ministry , the pneu was obsolete and unprofitable , handling fewer than 605,000 messages in 1983 , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry had actually stopped installing pneumatic tubes in all new post offices some time ago , thus converting the system into a sort of hybrid messenger service . The technique is easily recognized : first let the system deteriorate , then announce that usage is declining , so service must be curtailed and/or prices must go up . It sounds just like the New York City subway . The French postal ministry now offers " postexpress , " which guarantees same-day service for two or three times the price of a pneu . Soon people will forget that the pneu ever existed . <P> In London , just after World War II , the older generation complained that the entire postal system was going to perdition . There were only three deliveries a day in these straitened times . Why , before the war , there had been five . One oldtimer recalled that Edward FitzGerald , the translator of The Rubdiydt of Omar Khayyam , regularly wrote to London friends from his home near Lowestoft , 116 miles away , and counted on his letters being delivered before evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days , by Gad . <P> What doomed the pneu and the postal service , of course , was the telephone . Alexander Graham Bell 's new invention seemed so much faster , and consequently so much better . This was before the busy signal was invented , or statements like " He 's in conference right now . May I have him call you back ? " <P> There are people today who express wonder that figures like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams wrote a good number of personal letters every day ( and made copies too ) and still found time to run the country . Or even that Harry Truman regularly wrote to his wife . There are people today who receive a wedding invitation and answer with a telephone call , or forget to answer at all . There are people today who are psychologically unable to write a letter to anybody on any subject . Meanwhile , the postal system has silted up with all the debris of computerized commerce : catalogues from Wisconsin cheesemakers , offers of stock tips , pleas for charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
