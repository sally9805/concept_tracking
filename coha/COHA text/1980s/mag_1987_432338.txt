 | In more than 2 million American homes the dread after-dinner slide show has been replaced by the equally perilous home-video screening . Would-be Spielbergs armed with portable camcorders ? but careless with the trigger that rolls the tape ? end up spoiling their footage with inadvertent shots of sky and sidewalk . Novice camera operators can make a two-yearold 's birthday party seem staged by Fellini or give a wedding tape the feel of a Three Stooges short . And videotape 's low cost , compared with old-fashioned home-movie film , inspires epic-length productions . The parents of one California videophile recently received a three-hour tape of their grandchildren playing Trivial Pursuit . Dinner guests take heart ; high tech is coming to the rescue . Desktop video ? the use of computers and computerized equipment to edit , title and add Hollywood-style special effects to video productions ? can make amateur moviemakers look like pros . With inexpensive computers they can even create cartoon-style videos without using a camera . " A smart guy who spends $1,500 on video equipment , " says Mark Hahn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to put his friends to sleep . " On that basis , one analyst predicts that desktop video could be a $600 million industry by 1990 . Says Glenn Kenny , associate editor of Video Review : " People are suddenly figuring out they can do something about all those shots of their feet . " Dedicated videophiles have been able to edit their productions for some time , using two videotape decks , dubbing selected parts of one tape onto another . This is time consuming and , without specialized equipment , the transitions between scenes are often jerky and uneven . Computercontrolled editing equipment permits smooth " fades " and " wipes , " nearly indistinguishable from the Hollywood versions . Such edit controllers currently cost as little as $400 , though deluxe models range into the thousands of dollars . Special-effects generators , priced similarly , add touches such as " solarization " ? high-tech colorizing that makes an image look like a color negative ? and generate titles ( " A Video by . . . " ) in various typefaces . And a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on personal computers . " Even three years ago , " says Randy Burnworth of Showtime Video Ventures , " this kind of equipment would have filled a van . " Far-out graphics : Desktop video has also hooked the professionals in Tinseltown . The avant-garde TV program " Max Headroom , " the ultimate paean to video , uses futuristic graphics in almost every scene . Last season those graphics were produced by $200,000 worth of specialized video equipment . Next season the same effects will come from off-the-shelf Amiga personal computers , using consumer software like Electronic Arts ' Deluxe Video . " Nine- ty-nine percent of the graphics you see 07. the video monitors in the show will be produced live , by computers on the set , " says Richard Lewis , the production designer Desktop video can tailor films for the theater screen as well . San Francisco filmmaker Roy Kissin , who produced " On the Edge , " starring Bruce Dern , will use a personal computer to design the titles for his next film . " Normally , it 's hit or miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and  | you have to start over . But now I can send a dummy videotape , showing what I want , to the production house . If it saves one extra pass , I 'll have paid for the computer . " Desktop video also inspires entrepreneurs . " For less than $5,000 , " says Burnworth , " people can have a complete video studio , with multiple cameras , and go straight into business , shooting parties and weddings . " Rock-video boutiques have appeared in California shopping malls ( box ) . And Michael Zwerling , a Santa Cruz , Calif. , real-estate broker , uses computer-aided video to sell high-end property . Last week he was shooting footage of a million-dollar lot with views of the Pacific . A similar production by a professional video company might cost $5,000 ; Zwerling will edit it himself , at home , creating a " video brochure . " " I 'll put in music , some titles , some colorful special effects , and it will leave a lump in somebody 's throat . " Want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , so your words can zoom across the television screen ? New software packages , with names like VideoWorks and MacMovies , let amateurs animate videos on their personal computers , then save them on floppy discs , rather than videotapes . Company logos can tumble across the screen , or sales charts can roll along like the opening titles of " Star Wars . " " It 's like animated slides , " says Keith Masavage of Associated Computer Services in Springfield , Mo . One ACS customer was an ad agency that had used conventional artists to generate a presentation for a potential client , at a cost of $150,000 . The next time , ACS was able to produce a similar slide show for $160 , using about $3,000 worth of computer equipment . Future desktop video products for consumers will likely hide the com- puter altogether . Videonics 's DirectED is a small $499 box that connects a camcorder and VCR . Essentially a video computer , it adds an invisible timing track to raw videotape footage . Using a hand-held remote controller , its owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once marked , the scenes can be experimentally rearranged . When the arrangement of scenes is right , the DirectED will automatically create a final tape with all scenes in the exact order selected . Owners can also add titles and special effects , again by using a hand-held remote control . " This is to manual film editing , " says developer Hahn , " as word processing is to typing . " Magic medium : The new desktop video equipment should yield a generation of sophisticated home videos that bear little resemblance to the jerky home movies of the past . " Anyone , after work , can make a full feature film that you could sell to Hollywood , " brags Showtime 's Burnworth . " Our Kids Visit Disney World " : Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture ? Well ? maybe not . But given America 's penchant for television , and our eagerness to show off for friends and relatives , someday the afterdinner home video may actually spawn some real-life Spielbergs . Then , home movies might even become the high point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
