Wide-screen movies get sliced at the sides for TV <P> Theatrical movies , when they finally show up on television , have been treated like certain kinds of blue jeans : they have been shrunk to fit . No matter that the pay cable service promises the whole movie , just as it was shown in theaters . Never mind that free TV boasts of showing the same feature complete and uncut . No matter what station you watch , or how much you lay out for special cable channels , you are not seeing the complete movie . It may not have any scenes missing , but chances are it has been reframed , rephotographed and in essence redirected , to fit onto the home screen . <P> Back in the palmy days of Hollywood , movies were almost always made in one shape , a box that was 1.33 times as wide as it was high . But in the early ' 50s , competition from television ( whose screen shape is a narrower 1.23 to 1 ) brought box office desperation and technological innovation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that virtually doubled the width of the movie screen . The point was to give audiences an experience that they literally could not see on their small screens at home . But when the studios learned to stop worrying and love TV as a huge and unquenchable market for their films , one problem remained : how to squeeze those big movies into that little box . <P> The first solution was to show only the center of the wide-screen frame . The trouble was that anything or anyone on the sides of the frame was ignominiously deleted . Actors would be dropped from a scene , dialogue would get turned into mystifying soliloquies , and mainstream commercial movies like Advise and Consent would be transformed into weird avant-garde exercises in which the disembodied voices of actors floated from opposite sides of the picture as the camera focused on a table between them . Other solutions , like cutting from the right side of a frame to the left within what was originally one shot , were so dislocating that they induced brief spells of mal de mer . The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more sophisticated and rather less noticeable , but the viewer still comes up short . <P> Essentially , panning and scanning requires a technician to isolate a portion of the wide-screen action , recopy it onto tape or film and discard whatever else around it does not fit . In the process , 20% to 60% of the original image can be lost . The pan-and-scan technician moves optically over the film , creating tracking shots the director never intended ; he can also delete , by necessity or miscalculation , vital pieces of visual information . <P> In one of the most magical moments of Steven Spielberg 's Close Encounters of the Third Kind , scientists stare in unashamed wonder at the first appearance of a little space creature . In the 1981 television version , they just stared : the space creature was cut out of the picture . " It was a disaster , " Spielberg recalls . " It looked worse than the super-8 movies I make myself . " Says Stanley Kubrick , whose 2001 lost the introduction of the star child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1977 : " It 's a very unsatisfactory technique . It destroyed the compositional elements and often looks like a TV football game when the camera follows the man without the ball and has to pan back to pick up the key action . "
