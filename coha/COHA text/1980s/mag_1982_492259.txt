What is expected of the American automobile is demanded of few machines . In the course of a year , it is supposed to be safe and easy to drive ; log about 10,000 miles ; haul the Little League to games ; tow boats down to the landing ; take the kids to college ; provide comfort and cool air on a long vacation ; ride practically maintenance free , except for the odd quart of oil ; keep its finish without the benefit of being kept in a garage ; deliver 50-pound bags of fertilizer to the lawn ; pass trucks on the interstate ; fit into small , downtown parking spaces ; have a sound system like that of Carnegie Hall ; pollute nothing ; maintain a high trade-in value ; stand up to the abuse of the Dukes of Hazzard ; provide a romantic setting for teenagers ; and give the family dog a chance to take in some local errands . In a national sense , the feats that people expect of the auto industry are similarly Herculean . To be a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain economic progress ; lead the country out of recession ; provide numerous jobs and pay high wages ; make a profit for the shareholders ; endure the endless harassment of Ralph Nader ; build cars that are not only fuel efficient but clean running ; insure the safety of all passengers , no matter if they are wearing seat belts or not ; sell buses to the cities ; and serve , whenever the media needs one , as a convenient menace . All that is expected of imported cars is that they get good gas mileage . As a result , the American car and its industry have fallen on hard times . They have n't lived up to expectations . The consequence is the worst year for the car companies in a generation . A quarter-million autoworkers are unemployed . Related industries  --  steel , iron ore , rubber synthetics , to name but a few  --  are in the doldrums . Last year , of the major car manufacturers , only General Motors made money  --  and that was n't from its automobile division . In 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ward of the state , and the French , perhaps symptomatic of the age , own American Motors . If all this were n't bad enough , the industry now has to battle the country 's romance with small imported cars . These now account for more than a quarter of new car sales . In addition , the number of miles a car gets to the gallon has replaced the intelligence quotient as the figure which arbitrates the country 's social hierarchy . Those getting more than 40 mpg in their efficient little imports form a sneering aristocracy , which , no doubt , the BBC will someday chronicle in 12 parts as " The Honda Saga . " Thus it was with a bit of trepidation that I undertook to answer the question : " Why buy an American car ? " Easier , perhaps , to answer : " Why buy a Bulgarian watch ? " I assumed American cars to be inferior to their sportier counterparts from Germany and Japan . And , further , I assumed that Detroit had brought ruin to its own house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only now , was catching on to the truth . Nevertheless , I visited showrooms . I spoke with car owners around the country . I kicked tires . I underlined passages in Consumer Reports . Finally , I spent a week in Detroit , talking to executives and assembly-line workers alike , watching simulated head-on crashes and riding in test cars at 120 mph . In essence , I did what every car buyer dreams of doing before purchasing a car . What I found was that the quality of the American car is one of the great secrets of the society . A car I assumed to be nothing more than a showcase for conspicuous consumption  --  the Cadillac Cimmaron  --  turned out to be safer than a Volvo , with better gas mileage than a Toyota . I learned that American Motors , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , has one of the safest fleets of cars in the world and that a lot of Chevies have better drag coefficients , which translate into gas mileage , than many imports . On it went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when several considerations are weighed . The British have an expression , " Horses for courses , " meaning you should pick the appropriate thoroughbred for the right track . So it should be with automobiles . It is a nice dream that this country is one of narrow streets , like those of Japan , but the fact is , we are a nation of interstates , Little League teams and dogs that enjoy riding around in station wagons . Besides , there are 307 American car models from which to choose , each one designed with specific motoring needs in mind . Further , given the high quality of American cars , the issue of the nation 's economic welfare must also be considered . A bankrupt auto industry will cost the national treasury millions in welfare payments . Conversely , robust car sales could lead the country out of the by ambulance . The caption read , " But it got 43 mpg . " General Motors was  --  so we are told  --  appalled . The authoritative Automobile News called it " barbarous . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether anyone wants to realize it or not , the number of casualties each year on American highways is equivalent to the number of Americans who were killed in the Vietnam war . Last year , about 50,000 people were killed in traffic accidents . Many of these accidents were caused by drunk drivers , who , for incredible reasons , are still not treated in the manner of hardened criminals ( many of whom did less damage ) . According to both government findings and the laws of physics , if you are involved in an accident ( the odds call for one every ten years ) , your chances of being seriously hurt or killed double in a small car ? foreign or domestic . It is a fact , assuming always that seat belts are worn , that big cars are safer . Consumer Reports writes : " In real-world crashes between cars , the The point here is not to get into a lengthy debate about the meaning of the tests . Everyone , including the American car industry , likes challenging the authenticity of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are safe  --  if seat belts are worn and drivers maintain proper speeds . Invest in America As the auto industry goes , so goes much of the country . And right now , both are going nowhere . Whatever the economic arguments are for letting smokestack America disappear and become a service economy  --  based on insurance companies and McDonald 's  --  the realities of geopolitics dictate that the United States maintain its industrial base . John Manoogian , a vice president at Ford , credits the American industrial system as the reason , in large part , the country was able to win in World War II , in which he served with the Marines in the Pacific . " It 's inconceivable , " he told me , " that we 're not doing all we can to protect this country 's industrial base . " One reason the auto industry is suffering hard times is that the principles of free trade , which the United States follows , are disappearing around the world . Protection is putting it at a disadvantage . Witness relations with Japan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit for about $2,000 less . This saving is due to shrewd management and cheaper labor costs . As a result , in 1981 , they were able to export 2.3 million four-wheeled vehicles to the United States . But that 's not the problem . During the same period that the Japanese were invading the American market , U.S. automakers shipped only 11,000 cars to Japan . Here 's why : The Japanese have set numerous local standards , sometimes called nontariff barriers , against American cars . These standards include : an exhaust temperature alarm ; rear-view mirrors out near the headlights ; special head restraints ; side-marker lamps ; and a particular bulb to light the license plate . All these changes double the price of the American car . And , as if that were n't enough , U.S. imports are levied a road tax double that imposed on Japanese cars . For a Toyota Corolla , the road tax is $132.65 a year . For a comparable American car , the bill is $314.16 . Hence , to buy an American car is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as another for the preservation of a basic American industry . Put Detroit Back to Work Anyone interested in buying a new car , especially an import , ought to test drive it through the streets of Detroit . The city is a shadow of its former , industrial self . The downtown area , except for the glassed fortress of the Renaissance Center , is a patchwork of vacant lots and factories in disrepair . The minarets of capitalism , the smokestacks of the assembly plants , are still puffing what Charles Dickens in Hard Times described as " interminable serpents of smoke . " But at numerous intersections down the quietly decaying streets , clusters of men , obviously unemployed , mill about in idleness . The spirit of the city can be summed up by a sign that greets the visitor to the headquarters of the United Auto Workers : " 300 laid-off UAW workers do n't like your import . Park it in Tokyo , " The unemployment rate in Michigan is about 17 percent , twice the national average . One in six American jobs relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new automobiles means another 250,000 jobs . Yet there is the converse figure . If imports reach 35 percent of the market , it could cost the auto industry an additional 600,000 jobs . Edsel Ford II , a scion of the company 's founder , summarizes the importance of the industry for the rest of the country . When I spoke with him in his office , which overlooks the depressed downtown , he handed me a slip of paper on which he had written down the message of a bumper-sticker a friend of his saw earlier in the day : " Buy American . The job you save may be your own . " It Gets Good Mileage The irony in the general indictment of American automobiles as gas guzzlers is that , by and large , domestic cars are as fuel efficient as the imports . Yes , the diesel Rabbit runs forever on a thimble of kerosene , but then so does the Chevette or the Escort or the Horizon . Unbeknownst to many , Detroit has worked the magic of letting Americans have their large cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonneville , seemingly the last of the Brontosauri , now gets 21 mpg , according to the Environmental Protection Agency . The Chrysler Lebaron gets 26 mpg , as does the Buick Skylark , while a Volvo sedan gets 25 mpg . What it adds up to is that fuel economy is less and less a major determinant in the purchase , especially when the cost of gasoline is weighed against the other expenses of owning and operating a car . Compare on gasoline alone a Toyota Celica and an Oldsmobile Cutlass , based on gas at $1.35 a gallon and 10,000 miles a year in driving . The Celica , which gets 24 mpg , has annual fuel costs of $563 . The Cutlass gets 21 mpg and costs for a year $640 . Given that the average new car , domestic and foreign , costs $8,800 and given the rates of interest available to most buyers , $77 a year is not a significant savings . As a Ford analyst recently told the New York Times : " Today people take fuel efficiency for granted . They want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds for the big dollars they are paying out . " The Car Lasts a Long Time Despite the inconvenience and cost of repairing and of servicing an imported car in a small town , even the American automakers will admit that the inroads of foreign competitors were caused by the issue of quality . Quite simply , customers saw imports as being better made . And in part , they were right , because in the early ' 70s , Detroit occupied itself solely with the problem of production . Until the gas crises , anything that rolled off the assembly line sold briskly . Both the management and unions paid themselves handsomely and only a handful of technicians worried about quality , because on the average , Americans traded in their cars every few years . Continued on page 118 that abounds in Detroit , cars had to be " drab vanilla boxes . " You had n't really arrived socially until the passengers in your back seat could scratch their chins with their knees . Slowly , this attitude is changing , in part because the safety issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the passenger 's point of view , it is none too soon . Zara Rolfes is an engineer at the General Motors Proving Ground near Detroit , and she said it best : " The difference between an import and an American car is the difference between a folding chair and a sofa . " The Price Is Right The best buy on the market today is the medium-sized American car . It costs about $9,000 . Obviously , the small cars , foreign and rather than more . It 's Better Than You Think Not even the marketing experts in Detroit can really explain why Americans buy cars . Some say it 's styling ; others , fuel economy ; still others , quality and safety . The best anyone can come up with is a description of " that gut feeling " you get when you see something you want . For the last several years , the imports have generated that sensation in record numbers of Americans , putting us now in a situation where we may watch the decline and fall of the domestic auto industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there is hope for the future , it is in the competition that the U.S. makers face in the market . It has made them produce better , more effi cient and more stylish cars . Already this year , General Motors has introduced new models and new engines in numbers that far exceed past rates of innovation . Likewise at Ford , Chrysler and American Motors . Everyone in Detroit , for example , is hungry for a peek at the new Ford Mustang convertible or the revamped Corvette Chevrolet is bringing out in 1983 . This excitement , which can be gleaned at all levels of the business , may tell of a more vibrant market nationwide . First , however , Americans will have to start buying cars again  --  and domestic ones at that . A : domestic , are cheaper , but given what they offer in terms of safety , room and comfort , they are selling at a premium . To give two examples , Consumer Reports recommends buying the Chrysler Cordoba at around $9,200 : for the Toyota Corona , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium-sized imports cost a lot more than comparable American models . Consumer Reports suggests buying a Volvo with options that bring the cost up to $14,100 . The Chevrolet Celebrity , competitive in every way in the sedan market , costs $9,500 . The list price , however , should not be the only consideration . Because American car dealers are hungry for a sale , they are willing to negotiate on just about everything : options , financing , maintenance schedules , trade-ins . Import dealers have more the attitude of water salesmen in the desert and often simply say , " Take it or leave it , " as you stand over the idol of the cocktail-party circuit . But as with the tail fins of an earlier generation , you will pay dearly for prestige , even if your money is buying lessthen they have us come earlier and earlier to
