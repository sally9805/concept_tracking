MIDDLE EAST Trying to Break the Impasse Reagan expresses frustration , but no one has new ideas <P> The sun was rising over Washington when , promptly at 7 a.m. last Wednesday , Vice President George Bush convened a special high-level meeting in the White House Situation Room . National Security Adviser William Clark was there , along with CIA Chief William Casey , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Special Envoy Philip Habib , who had been hastily summoned home from his diplomatic shuttle in the Middle East . The purpose of the gathering : to find a way to break the impasse in negotiations to secure the withdrawal of Israeli , . Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization troops from Lebanon . The mood was somber . " Everyone in the Administration is angry , " said a White House aide . " The President himself is as angry as everybody else over here . " <P> If Reagan was losing patience , it was because the failure to negotiate a withdrawal of troops from Lebanon was becoming a major obstacle to the broader Middle East peace initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Israeli-occupied West Bank would be linked in a loose confederation to Jordan . Although the officials who met at the White House last week agreed that the U.S. should put additional pressure on Israel to get the stalled talks moving , they apparently decided on little more than what a senior diplomat described as " a renewed U.S. push , coupled with a very strong and very sincere expression of presidential frustration . " Added the official : " There are not really new ideas or proposals . " <P> The current impasse is in part the result of an Israeli demand that Jerusalem and Beirut be the sole venues for direct Israeli-Lebanese talks . The Lebanese , who have already made concessions on several procedural points , refuse to meet with the Israelis in Jerusalem on the grounds that to do so would be to recognize Jerusalem 's status as the capital of Israel , something even the U.S. has not done . White House officials seem increasingly convinced that Israel is deliberately imposing impossible conditions in order to prevent the talks from beginning . This , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin opposes . Any delay in addressing Reagan 's Sept. 1 plan would also enable Israel to proceed with the expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank , thereby gradually making any form of Palestinian sovereignty more difficult to accept . <P> The Administration was also angry last week about a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee amendment that would add $475 million to the proposed $2.5 billion in U.S. economic and military aid to Israel in 1983 . Fearing that such an in crease in aid would signal that the U.S. was unable , or unwilling , to exercise any pressure on Israel , the White House lobbied hard against the proposal . Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said last week that this White House action , which he labeled an " unfriendly act , " would be " detrimental to Mideast peace . "
