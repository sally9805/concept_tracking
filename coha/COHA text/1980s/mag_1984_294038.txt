Hit with some titillating charges , the Pentagon 's No. 2 exits <P> The 43-page complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission was written in the usual dry legalese . But the bare facts that it laid out would make a fitting plot for J.R . and his cronies . The former chief executive of a $4 billion Dallas-based conglomerate , 64 , has a " private personal relationship " with a company receptionist and provides her with " monetary support . " He shares " lunches , dinners , trips , vacations , and social gatherings " with a small circle of high-living Southerners and their women friends . Generously , but illegally , he also shares stock tips worth $1.9 million with his friends . <P> Adding piquancy to the plot are the identity of the executive and his most recent job : Deputy Secretary of Defense <P> Paul Thayer . Last week the SEC charged that Thayer , as chairman of LTV Corp . and board member of Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Allied Corp. , improperly passed along inside information to his friends . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York federal court , Thayer resigned as the Pentagon 's No. 2 man . Thayer termed the charges " entirely without merit " and vowed to fight them . At week 's end his replacement had been named : William Howard Taft IV , the self-effacing chief counsel of the Defense Department , a protg of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and great-grandson of the 27th President of the U.S. <P> The SEC complaint follows a ten-month investigation . It alleges that Thayer , who is married , has had a " personal relationship " since 1979 with Sandra Ryno , now 38 , a divorcee and a former receptionist at LTV , the company he left a year ago for Washington . During 1981 and 1982 , the SEC claims , Thayer passed stock tips to Ryno and seven other defendants in the suit . All seemed to come from soap-opera central casting . <P> One is Stockbroker Billy Bob Harris , 44 , who is " a regular celebrity groupie , " says Writer Edwin ( " Bud " ) Shrake , a former Dallas sports columnist . Harris is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC Monday Night Football commentator and TV pitchman ; former Cowboy and Denver Bronco Quarterback Craig Morton , his onetime roommate ; and country-and-western Singer Kenny Rogers . The broker 's parties are known for " wall-to-wall girls , champagne , hot tubs and more girls , " says Shrake . They were vividly portrayed in fictionalized form in the movie North Dallas Forty . Harris , who gave stock reports on Dallas TV , announced on television that he had undergone a lie-detector test , which , he claimed , proved his innocence . <P> According to the SEC , Harris used the stock tips to benefit Julie Williams , 26 , a public relations firm employee who also teaches aerobic dancing at a health spa . <P> Williams , the complaint alleges , has a " close personal relationship " with Harris . <P> Others who profited from Thayer 's stock tips , the complaint goes on , included Gayle Schroder , 46 , chairman of First American Bank and Trust of Baytown , Texas ; Malcolm Davis , 48 , a convicted gambler and president of a Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
