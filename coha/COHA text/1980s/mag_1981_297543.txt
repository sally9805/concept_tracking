Moscow conducts an open-ended battle against a resilient insurgency <P> For nearly two years a Soviet expeditionary force of 85,000 troops has propped up Afghanistan 's Communist regime against a motley but tenacious resistance movement . Soviet intervention in Afghanistan has become a chronic irritant in East-West relations : Secretary of State Alexander Haig reiterated U.S. outrage in his talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at the United Nations a month ago , and the Afghanistan issue will probably be debated in the U.N . General Assembly next month . Most Western press coverage of the conflict has come from listening posts in Pakistan and India and from reporters who have slipped into rebel-held territory . TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott received a rare visa from the Afghan government and last week sent this report from Kabul : <P> During daylight , Kabul seems almost like a city at peace . Almost , but not quite . There are reminders , some constant and subtle , others sudden and dramatic , that this is a land at war with itself and with its giant neighbor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital . <P> At a dusty park , children frolic on a makeshift wooden Ferris wheel , seemingly oblivious of the armored personnel carrier at an intersection near by , a searchlight mounted on its turret . The younger children cluster around a foreigner , taking him for a Soviet , chanting " Khorosho ! Khorosho ! " ( good ) . Older youths , approaching or just over the compulsory military draft age of 15 , withdraw sullenly . <P> At the main mosque on the bank of the Kabul River , the faithful gather for midday prayers . Most are old men , many of them crippled . In the midst of their worship , the droning incantations from the loudspeakers on the minarets are momentarily drowned out by the roar of two camouflaged MiG-21s streaking toward targets upcountry . Outside , a truck goes by with two Soviet soldiers in the back . They wear wide-brimmed khaki ranger hats and olive-drab bulletproof vests , and they hold their Kalashnikov assault rifles at the ready , barrels upright , on their knees . <P> Commercial air traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kabul airport normally , but the Soviet Ilyushin and Antonov military transports that use the same runway bank sharply after takeoff and climb to a safe altitude in a tight spiral . There is rising concern that rebels armed with hand-held SA-7 antiaircraft missiles may be hiding in the hills around the capital . <P> In the densely populated old part of Kabul , numerous houses are flying red banners . There is nothing ideological about them . It is an Afghan custom to hoist a green or blue flag if someone in a household has died , a red one if death occurred by unnatural causes , " such as murder or in war , " as a resident explains . <P> Trade in the bazaars is brisk . It includes a thriving black market in which Soviet soldiers barter vodka , clothing , even ammunition for hashish . Here and there , turbaned vendors beckon for customers to examine straw baskets filled with lethal-looking daggers with 6-to 8-in. blades . A pair of passing Soviet privates , their Kalashnikovs at their sides , eye the knives nervously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
