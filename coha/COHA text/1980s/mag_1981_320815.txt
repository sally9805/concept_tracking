Justices shield nude dancing , but not indigent parents <P> Like bookshelves and airline seating , court dockets can make for strange juxtapositions . Last week the Supreme Court handed down notable decisions that were as disparate as their subjects : while it held that the First Amendment protects nude dancing from being completely zoned out of a commercial area , it also ruled that the 14th Amendment does not automatically give poor parents the right to free legal assistance at parental termination hearings . <P> <P> A Mantle for Nude Dancing <P> The nudie show can go on in Mount Ephraim , N.J. , a small ( pop . 4,863 ) bedroom community near Camden and Philadelphia . At the Six-Thirteen Corp . " adult bookstore , " customers used to be able to pop a token worth 25 into a coin-operated machine , causing a shade to roll up revealing a nude dancer doing her bumps and grinds in a glass booth . But Mount Ephraim had a zoning ordinance that in effect banned all live entertainment , while allowing such commercial activities as restaurants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its operators , James Schad and Toni Taylor , were found guilty of violating the ordinance and fined $300 . Although Schad and Taylor invoked First Amendment protection . New Jersey courts held that the case was strictly a zoning matter . <P> The Supreme Court disagreed . Entertainment , wrote Justice Byron White for six of his brethren in the seven-man majority , falls " within the First Amendment guarantee , " as do political speech and ideological speech , and " nudity alone " can not strip away this " mantle . " Noted the court : " The zoning power is not infinite and unchallengeable . " Nor was the court impressed with Mount Ephraim 's justification for the ban-that it would avert parking problems and the need for additional police protection-since the town allowed a variety of other commercial enterprises . The ordinance was overly broad , said the court , in that it banned all forms of live entertainment but failed to show how such entertainment posed special problems to the community . <P> Chief Justice Warren Burger dissented in an opinion joined by Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignores fundamental values that the Constitution ought to protect " and " trivializes and demeans " the First Amendment . Said Burger : " Citizens should be free to choose to shape their community so that it embodies their conception of the ' decent life ' ... When , and if , this ordinance is used to prevent a high school performance of The Sound of Music , for example , the court can deal with that problem . "
