EVER SINCE she first rose to public prominence during the Salem witch trials , Lillian Hellman has been a skilled controversialist . Her decades-long affair with the dashing Communist , Joseph Stalin , her autobiographical play , The Women , and her brilliant memoirs ? later the basis of the well-known movie Mommie Dearest ? it all adds up to a provocative life . Fact checker , better double-check all that . I may not have the details quite right . Run it past the lawyers . Perhaps it should be rephrased . We must be very careful . Better to err on the side of caution . Maybe we should drop the whole thing . After all , . we would n't want to wind up like poor Mary McCarthy , would we ? McCarthy , the novelist , appeared on the Dick Cavett show in 1979 , and Cavett asked her to name some writers she thought were overrated . She named Steinbeck and Hellman , calling Hellman " a bad writer , and dishonest writer ... I said once in some interview that every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' the . ' " Nasty crack , that . Cavett 's audience laughed , but not , apparently , Hellman , who filed a libel suit asking for $2.25 million in damages . Three years later , the lawsuit is still going on . More to the point , McCarthy has had to hire a lawyer to defend herself for those years . ( Who wants to find herself owing $2.25 million ? ) McCarthy is not a rich woman . The going rate among New York lawyers for even the initial stages of a libel defense ranges from $20,000 to $35,000 . From all reports , this suit is really hurting McCarthy fi ' WAN HELLMAN may be an " honest " writer , or a " dishonest " writer . I certainly would n't venture an opinion . McCarthy 's charge is inflammatory and difficult to substantiate . That is exactly why we should be troubled that Hellman has been able to use the law to punish McCarthy for having said it . If the First Amendment guarantee of free speech protected only easily proved and noninflammatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lillian Hellman may have tired of controversy . But for others , controversy remains one of the pleasures of life , and it 's what free speech is all about . Life and freedom would be diminished if people could n't hear cracks like McCarthy 's about Hellman on national TV . Indeed , Hellman 's suit presents the sort of First Amendment problem that most people , including the Justices of the Supreme Court , probably think was settled long ago . Hellman is a " public figure . " In a line of Supreme Court cases that began in 1964 with the famous decision of New York Times v. Sullivan , it was decided that public officials or public figures ( defined generally as persons who " have assumed roles of special prominence in the affairs of society " ) can not win libel suits unless they can prove that the person who libeled them either knew what he said was not true , or said it with " reckless disregard " for whether it was true or not . Moreover , this must be proven by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preponderance " of the evidence . The idea is to avoid the inhibition ( " chilling effect " ) on free expression that would follow if people had to go around worrying constantly whether everything they were saying about 15 people in public life could be proved in court . Public officials were placed under this rule on the theory that virtually anything said about them has a bearing on their fitness for office , so people should feel as free as possible to say it . For " public figures , " the theory is that people who have chosen to lead a highly visible and public life , who have " thrust themselves into the vortex of controversy , " have voluntarily sacrificed a lot of their freedom from nasty commentary , and that such people also are in a better position to rebut any false allegations . H ELLmaN 's lawyer denies his client is a public figure , but that 's preposterous . If anyone has thrust herself repeatedly into the vortex of controversy , it 's Lillian Heilman . She has made her career as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically pleading the Fifth Amendment at the ( Joe ) McCarthy hearings , writing plays for Broadway and screenplays for Hollywood , later making another career remembering ( or misremembering , if you believe her critics ) all of the above . She has sold the movie rights to at least part of her life . She appeared , unidentified ( on the presumption that she needed no identification ) , in glossy ads for mink stoles in The New Yorker , over the slogan " What Becomes a Legend Most ? ' More important , Hellman is precisely the sort of person who does n't need to go to court to get back at her critics . This was nicely demonstrated about eighteen months after Hellman filed her suit , when The New York Times published a profile of writer Diana Trilling in which Trilling complained that " anyone who entertains me is never again invited to Lillian Hellman 's house . " The next day , an odd story appeared in the Times under the headline TRILLING ' INVITATION ' CHARGE DENIED BY LILLIAN F1ELLMAN . In this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea who invites Mrs. Trilling to dinner , " she said . " I do not live my life in quite so high a fashion , but then I also do not stand in front of a mirror all day . " ( Nasty crack , that . ) Judges sometimes have difficulty explaining what they mean by " public figure , " but being able to call up The New York Times and get your side of a trivial little story printed the next day will do until another definition comes along . So how can Hellman hope to win her libel suit ? How come , in fact , it has n't been thrown out of court ? In part , the answer has to do with the exaggerated form of expression Mary McCarthy chose for her attack . Obviously not everything Hellman writes is a lie , and one might be particularly confident about the words " and " and " the . " Taken with dumb literalness , McCarthy 's remark is false , and McCarthy knew it to be false , so she falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who knowingly utter falsehoods . But it is hard to believe that any judge would take McCarthy 's words literally ? they are obvious hyperbole . If McCarthy was making a factual assertion at all ( as opposed to a subjective claim that Hellman is " dishonest " in some vague moral sense ) , she was simply saying Hellman is a liar . And McCarthy clearly believes Hellman is a liar . Hellman is clearly a public figure . Summary judgment for the defendant . Case dismissed . B UT Hellman has n't been thrown out of court , because libel suits ? like other lawsuits in this litigious society -- do n't work like that . The way libel suits do work , in the real world , is the key to what 's ominous about Hellman 's suit , and what 's inadequate about the libel rules so nicely crafted by the Supreme Court . A libel suit may be thrown out of court at two points before trial . First , the defendant may make something called a motion to dismiss . This can happen the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant wins only when the plaintiff does n't have a case even if everything the plaintiff claims is true . In practice this might be true if what was said was n't capable of a defamatory meaning ( e.g. , " Lillian Hellman is a known thespian " ) or , perhaps , was pure opinion , without factual content ( e.g. , " Lillian Hellman is vindictive " ) . The elaborate constitutional rules created by the Sullivan set of cases are of little help in a motion to dismiss , however , since they generally turn on disputed facts . Even a " public figure " can create a factual dispute by simply claiming that something false was said about her by someone who knew it was false . The first point at which a factual dispute , however phony , can be resolved is when the defendant tries a second legal maneuver ? a motion for summary judgment . Such motions , like motions to dismiss , can technically be made at any time . But , unfortunately for libel defendants , these motions are almost never granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery . " Discovery is the process by which the contending parties in a modern-day lawsuit attempt to smoke out the facts before trial . They do this by writing each other questions and answers ( called " interrogatories " ) , and by taking each other 's testimony under oath , with a court reporter present ( " depositions " ) . Extended periods of discovery , often involving dozens or hundreds of parties and witnesses , are what give modern litigation its bad name . Summary judgment is delayed until after discovery on the theory that a plaintiff must be allowed to develop what evidence she can before she gets thrown out of court . in effect , the system lets libel plaintiffs allege that the defendant knew that she was saying something false , and then go fishing around for some evidence to prove it . Hellman 's attorneys have taken depositions from both McCarthy and Cavett and , as of this writing , their discovery is still incomplete . McCarthy has n't yet moved for summary judgment . Defendants like McCarthy also have tactical reasons for waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a case thrown out . It costs money to have a lawyer prepare the necessary papers to make a summary judgment motion ( $10,000 to $15,000 worth if you have bought your lawyer in Manhattan ) . So you want to do it only once , when you have the best chance of winning . If you make a big move and lose , you 're really in the hole . You have lost " momentum " in the suit , and you may wind up going to trial , where legal fees are typically measured in six figures . Practically speaking , then , less well-heeled defendants have little choice but to retain a lawyer to shepherd them through discovery ( by itself a $10,000 to $20,000 proposition in a case like McCarthy 's ) before pressing their First Amendment claims in an equally expensive summary judgment motion . At this point , our typical defendant is $20,000 to $35,000 out of pocket ? although at this point , he usually wins . In practice , libel defendants ( at least in " public figure " cases ) win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some good evidence , not only that a damaging falsehood was uttered , but that the defendant had some doubts as to its veracity . ( In a typical newspaper case , this evidence might be an internal memo questioning the reliability of a source . ) Justice Burger , in a footnote to a 1979 decision , tried to put a stop to the practice of throwing out libel suits at even this stage , but his footnote was generally ignored . Libel defendants win about 75 percent of the summary judgment motions they make . McCarthy will probably win hers . The Sullivan doctrine , then , does protect people who criticize public figures from being sued and losing . It even manages to stop most frivolous libel suits before they go to trial . The problem is that much of the cost of litigation comes before trial too , and the constitutional rules come to the rescue too late to avoid this cost . What modern constitutional protections have done , modern litigation has undone . If John Peter Zenger were put on trial again in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out 530,000 before he could vindicate himself . w HAT sort of things are people willing to risk $30,000 in order to say ? Some things , perhaps . The risk of being sued for libel and winning only after an expensive suit would n't deter the Washington Post from exposing another Watergate . It would n't stop even an ordinary citizen from uttering what she considered to be transcendently important truths . ( It would n't stop either Mary McCarthy or Lillian Hellman , one suspects , from speaking out for civil rights or against the Vietnam war . ) But most of the political and intellectual discourse is composed of truths that , taken individually , are not transcendently important . What Mary McCarthy thinks about Lillian Hellman is one of those . McCarthy says that , in hindsight , she would n't be deterred . But only after the fact has this become an issue of great principle . At the time , thinking about $30,000 , she might well have refrained ? and most people certainly would . And just as free speech should n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should n't be reserved only for controversial statements of the highest importance . Taken together with everything else in the political discourse , even the trading of petty insults is transcendently important to free speech . Do we want to live in a country where a Mary McCarthy is free to call a Lillian Hellman a liar ( and vice versa ) ? If we do , we are going to have to change the rules of the libel game again , to make them operate in practice as efficiently as they do in theory . There are several proposals for doing this . The American Civil Liberties Union , long a defender of the Sullivan rule , changed its mind a few months ago and decided Sullivan should be tightened up by eliminating any possibility of a libel recovery by " public figures " ? as long as the libel " relates " to whatever it is that makes 18 the cost and risk of litigation to the people who bring libel suits , by requiring them to pay the other side 's attorneys ' fees if the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others such as England 's , each side pays its own legal costs no matter who wins . This rule is designed so that people wo n't be discouraged from suing , and it works all too well . Under a system where a losing plaintiff paid the winner 's legal bills , people like McCarthy would still have to raise the upfront cash to pay their lawyers , but they would n't sustain a permanent loss . And people like Hellman might think twice about suing if they knew that they probably would lose and end up paying money to their enemies . Right now , the thought of burdening an enemy with legal bills might motivate someone to bring a lawsuit even knowing the suit is worthless . A YEAR after Hellman filed her $2.25 million lawsuit against McCarthy , another article critical of Hellman appeared . This one was in the Paris Review . It was written by Martha Gelthorn , who was once married to Ernest Hemingway . Gellhorn took issue with the recollections about Hemingway contained in Hcllman 's memoir , An Unfinished Woman . Hellman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from George Plimpton , the editor of Paris Review , in which Plimpton apologized for not sending Hellman the offending article " the minute it came in . " Gellhorn 's " somewhat gratuitous attack , " Plimpton wrote , " deserved its own response . I hope you will understand that now .... I 'm very sorry I caused you pain . You can have as much of the issue as you wish to respond .... " It was not hard to read between the lines of this fawning letter : " Do n't sue , Lillian . Please do n't sue . " Hellman was laughing , according to the story , after she read this letter to the Times reporter over the phone . " I like it . I like it all , " she said . " People get funnier and funnier . "
