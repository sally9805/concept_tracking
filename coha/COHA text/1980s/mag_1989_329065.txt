THE CONTROL OF NATURE <P> by John McPhee <P> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux <P> 272 pages ; $17.95 <P> It has been nearly 25 years since John McPhee struck out for areas relatively unknown , to prove by deft reportage that anything can be interesting if it is presented well . He has written arrestingly about subjects as mundane as oranges and as momentous as high-energy physics and the geologic forces that shape our planet . The three pieces that constitute his 20th book , Atchafalaya , Cooling the Lava and Los Angeles Against the Mountains , deal with the power of determined people to tame water , fire and earth . <P> McPhee 's heroes are not content to go with the flow , be it the Mississippi River 's wanton meanderings , the angry surge of molten rock from an Icelandic volcano , or the periodic slide of real estate in California 's San Gabriel Mountains , where waterborne debris can roar down hillsides and turn million- dollar dream houses into nightmares for owners and insurance companies . McPhee 's strength is the odd detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eaves . Boulders sat on the roof . Thirteen automobiles were packed around the building , including five in the pool . . . The stuck horn of a buried car was blaring . The family in the darkness in their fixed tableau - watched one another by the light of a directional signal endlessly blinking . " <P> Unsurprisingly , accounts of expensive residences becoming kindling , or descriptions of boots bursting into flame as perspiring Icelanders combat the creep of lava that threatens their fishing village , are fundamentally more dramatic than the mysterious workings of southern Louisiana hydrology . Yet all three elemental battles recounted by the masterly McPhee are unified by the most uncontrolled and stubborn of all forces : human nature .
