When former Texas Senator John Tower sat down for a job interview with George Bush in mid-November , he had a surprise for the President-elect : a five-point plan for cleaning up the mess at the Pentagon . Since the plan came from , of all people , the hawkish Tower , Bush was startled  --  and impressed  --  by what he heard . " It was the exact opposite of what they expected him to say , " said an adviser who helped Tower prepare . According to Tower 's associates , Bush declared near the end of the meeting that he would announce his choice for Secretary of Defense after Thanksgiving . <P> More than a week later , Bush still had not filled the top Pentagon job . Aides to both the President-elect and the former Senator said Bush was postponing a decision until someone with strong management credentials could be found to serve as Tower 's deputy . But as reports circulated that Tower had been a paid consultant for several weapons makers and had a reputation for drinking , the drawn-out negotiations became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " admitted a Bush aide . Nearly all the signals indicated that Bush would eventually stand by his fellow Texan . Nevertheless , the hesitation revealed how uneasy the President-elect , his aides and most of official Washington have come to feel about Tower . <P> Many Washington insiders have been wondering why the former Republican Senator was in line for the spot in the first place . Tower , whose slicked-back hair and double-breasted pinstripe suits sometimes give him the look of a Mafia capo , had several strikes against him . Having been Senate Armed Services Committee chairman during the first four years of the Reagan buildup , he seemed ill-equipped to oversee the Bush slowdown . On the Hill , Tower had a reputation as a man who could n't say no to a weapons system . He was regarded by his own backers as autocratic and impatient with lesser minds  --  a " mean s.o.b . " who never got along well with key members of Congress , said a loyal aide . <P> But Tower was a cunning legislator who delighted in frustrating congressional liberals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiating style . Moreover , he wanted the Defense job when few others did . He campaigned for Bush , rushed to Dan Quayle 's defense after the Republican Convention , and joined New Hampshire Governor John Sununu 's Dukakis-bashing brigade . Tutored by several former aides who now hold top Pentagon , White House and budget-making jobs , Tower wowed Bush during their Nov. 17 meeting and several days later made a similar impression on Sununu , soon to be White House chief of staff , and Secretary of State-designate James Baker . <P> Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady nonetheless wanted Bush to name a top deputy whose management skills would signal that the new Administration &; is serious about budget cutting . Not many candidates wanted to play second fiddle . Norman Augustine , chief executive officer of Martin Marietta , and Paul O'Neill , CEO of Alcoa , turned down the deputy 's job . Republican Senator Pete Wilson of California began whooping it up for Rand Corp . president Donald Rice , whose many qualifications include the fact that he is a close friend and golfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat Sam Nunn . Rice , who flew to Washington last Wednesday , appeared to have the inside track .
