 | Even now I see the curved glass cabinet d(x)rs in the streetlight coming through the French windows . I hear my breathing . I catch sight of my own face in the salver . Loot-laden I tiptoed over the thick rug I half walked half ran through the streets clutching my lumpy lumberjacket . I had a room on the West Side in a rooming house fifty cents a night no cooking . In the morning going to work from across the wide cobblestone street the cars going past , the streetcars ringing their bells horns blowing trucks ratcheting along with chain-wheel drive I see in Graeber 's Groceries Fancy Fruits and Vegetables an officer of the law in earnest conversation with my employer . Come with me Compute with me Computerized she prints out me Commingling with me she becomes me Coming she is coming is she Coming she is a comrade of mine Sometimes around those fires by the river a man would talk a war veteran usually who had a vision of things , who could say more than how he felt or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday . And invariably he was a socialist or a communist or an anarchist and he 'd call you brother or comrade this fellow and he was always contemplative and did n't seem to mind if anyone listened to him or not . Not that he was wise or especially decent or kind or even that he was sober but even if none of these in those fitful flashes of lucidity like momentary flares of a dying fire he 'd say why things were as they were . I liked that . It was a kind of music , I lingered by the edges of the city with the hobos and at night that grand and glorious civilization now had walls all around it we were on the outside looking up at this immense looming presence , a fortress now it was a kind of music to point to the walls and suggest why they would come down .

It would go on two three minutes he 'd take a swig eyes would roll up in his skull and he 'd pass out falling backward into the fire and he 'd roast his brains if we did n't pull him out his hair smoking his singed burned hair . Wide awake again he 'd tell us more . But it was here I also learned about California . In California you could eat the oranges off the trees , along the seaside boulevards the avocados fell when they were ripe and you found them everywhere and peeled them and you ate them on the seaside boulevards . When you were sleepy you slept on the sand and when you were hot you went wading in the warm Pacific surf and the waves lit up at night off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves was a gambling ship . I decided to go to California . Armed only with his unpronounceable last name , he went down to the freight yards to begin his journey . He confuses this now in his mind with the West Side slaughtering plant such atomized extract of organic essence , such a perfumery of disembowelment , that in the fetid blood spumed viscera mist above the yards helplessly flew flights of gulls schools of pigeons moths bats insect plagues all swirling round and round in a great squawking endlessly ejaculative anguish . I found a door that slid open , got it wide enough to slip through , climbed in , pulled the door almost shut behind me stood in the darkness breathing triumph . The car lurches again , almost stops , begins to roll , I was thrown into something that moved . I look around my private car my eyes accustoming themselves to the darkness , soot and pungent cinder begins to flow through the boards , that railroad tang , my eyes see all around the perimeter of my private car a cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation there must have been thirty or forty of us in that car gradually my eyes made out fifty sixty sitting on the floor by the dawn in eastern Pennsylvania at a siding in the chill frosted morning a hundred of us jun-ped and ran when the bulls came shouting  | ahead from the engine . Later alone in the tall weeds of another crossing a toot and leisurely around the bend hell-clanging another stately red ball my chance I make for it all around me from the weeds a thousand like me leap I thought I was alone . I let it go . All my gaunt brothers in my own rags carrying my roped valise hopped the freight . I watched it go . I put up my collar pulled my cap down on my head stuck my hands in my pockets and headed north up the road .  | Come with me Compute with me Computerized she prints out me Commingling with me she becomes me Coining she is coming is she Conning she is a comrade of mine C ( nnradcs come all over comrades Communists come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete our fusion We are here to create confusion ) - you confuse coining with confession ?

Lying in a city mission flop in the great stink of mankind was worse . Arraigned in the ranks of the selfdeluding in their bunkbeds was worse . It was the bums of the commonest conversation who angered him the most , the casuists of misfortune who bragged about the labels inside their torn filthy coats , or swore there was some brand of alcohol they would n't be so low as to drink . Or the ones who claimed to be only temporarily down on their luck , en route to some glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family , but where they were known , where what they were did not have to be proved . I did n't want these mockeries to my own kingship of consciousness , with all the conquests of my life still to come . How could I hope or scheme however idly in a flophouse with a hundred others , a thousand others , a hundred thousand others where the dreams rise on the breath and dissolve one another in a precipitate element not your own  --  and you are trapped in it , a dark underwater kingdom fed by springs of alcoholic piss and sweat , in which there live and swim the vilest phantoms of God . And strangely enough each morning I woke up still alive . In the lake villages and the small towns of old mills , I was moved along by the constable but a shade more gently . I did n't feel like a tramp when I asked for work . I even had a certain distinction . We were like birds or insects , pestilential , when we buzzed or flocked in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain scientific interest . Sometimes I washed dishes for a meal . Sometimes I stole my food . Sometimes I found a day 's work at some farm . Then in one town , walking down the main street in a manner that suggested I had someplace to go , I saw coming out of the drugstore three midgets and a heavyset dwarf who huddled over them like their father . They took their quick little steps down the street , all talking at the same time , the muscular torso of the dwarf jolting from side to side with each step . I followed them . Even when they noticed me following them I followed them . They led me to the edge of town . In a grass lot between two stands of trees was the Hearn Bros. carnival , a traveling show of tattered brown tents , old trucks , kiddy rides and paint-peeled wagons . I heard the growl of a big cat . Ah , what I felt standing there in the sun ! A broken-down carnival ? a few acts , a few rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made tie a boy again . I was going backward . Those ridiculous bickering midgets had called up my love for tiny things , my great unslaked child 's thirst for tiny things , as if I had never held enough toys that were small to my small hand . Holy shit a carnival ! I knew it was for me as sure as I knew my own face in the mirror .  | I hung around . I made myself useful . They were still putting it together . I helped lay the wooden track for the kiddy cars . I heaved-ho the tent ropes , I set the corral poles for the pony ride . There were three or four tired stiffs doing these things . I recognized them for what they were , everyone of them had a pint of wine in his pocket , they were no problem at all . I thought the Hearn Bros. were lucky to have me . But nothing happened . Nobody paid attention . At dusk the generator was cranked , and the power went on with a thump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the loudspeakers , the Wheel of Fortune went ratatat-tat , and I saw how money was made from the poor . They drifted in , appearing starved and sucked dry , but holding in their palms the nickels and dimes that would give them a view of Wolf Woman , Lizard Man , the Living Oyster , the Fingerling Family and in fact the whole Hearn Bros. bestiary of human virtue and excellence . The clear favorite was Fanny the Fat Lady . She sat on a scale that was like a porch swing . Over her head a big red arrow attested to six hundred and eight pounds . Someone doubted that . She responded with an emphatic sigh and the arrow fluctuated wildly , going as high as nine hundred . This made people laugh . She was dressed in a short jumper with a big collar and a bow in her hair , just like Shirley Temple . Her dyed red hair was set in waves over her small skull . The other freaks did routines or sold souvenirs and pamphlets of their life stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to be gazed on , her slathered legs crossed at the ankles . I could n't stop looking at her . Finally I caught her attention , and her little painted mouth widened like the wings of a butterfly as if it were basking on some pulpy extragalactic flower . The folds of her chins rising in cups of delicate hue , her blue eyes setting like moons behind her cheeks , she smiled at me and unsmiled , smiled and unsmiled , sitting there with each arm resting on the base of a plump hand supported by a knee that was like the cap of an exotic giant white mushroom . I realized she was slow-witted . Behind her and off to the side was a woman who was keeping an eye out , maybe a relative , a mother , an aunt . This woman looked at me with the alert eyes of the canicy . And as I went about I saw those eyes everywhere behind the show , alert came ) / eyes on the gaunt man with a white shirt and tic and sleeve garters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the freaks themselves staring out from their enclosures . What were they looking for ? Life ! A threat ! An advantage ! I had that look myself . I recognized it , I knew these people . But I was n't getting anywhere with them . By midnight the crowd had thinned out . The lights were blinked in warning and the generator was turned off . The last of the rubes drifted back into the hills . They held Kewpie dolls . They held pinwheels . I saw the acts going into their trailers to find some supper or drink some wine . I sat across the road with my back against a tree . I wanted a job with the carney . It seemed to me the finest possible way to live . A while later a truck came along running without headlights and it turned into the dark lot . I sat up . I heard the truck doors slam . A few minutes later an old car and three men got out and walked into the carney . Other men arrived on foot , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crossed the road . There was some kind of renewed commerce , I did n't understand . I saw the belly dancer standing in the door of her trailer her arms folded a man at the foot of the steps tipped his cap . I saw the girl who sold tickets outside her booth she was looking into a hand mirror and primping her hair . At the back end of the lot in the shadow of the trees a line of men and boys outside a trailer . I went there and got on the end of the line . A man came out and talked in low tones to the others . I heard something moaning . Another man went in . From the trailer came these sounds of life 's panic , shivers and moans and shrieks and crashings and hoarse cries , the most awesome fuckmusic I had ever heard . I got closer . I had n't seen before sitting on a chair at the foot of the trailer steps that same woman attendant from the afternoon who kept a close and watchful eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | led her from the trailer to the tent in the afternoon and back to her trailer at the end of the night . She placed her hand on my shoulder , and walking behind me at arm 's length with a great quivering resettlement of herself at each step , she made her stately trustful way down the midway . Once she hugged me . She was surprisingly gentle I did not share the popular lust for her I was embarrassed and maybe frightened by that mountainous softness I pulled away . Right away I saw I 'd made a mistake . Fanny had a cleft palate and on top of that the sounds she made were in Spanish but I could tell her feelings were hurt . I moved to her and let her hug me . She put her warm hand on the small of my back . I thought I felt the touch of an astute intelligence . She was truly sensitive to men , she had a real affection for them . She did n't know she was making money , she never saw the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it did n't matter what happened , if they came in the folds of her thighs or the creases in the sides of her which spilled over the structure of her trunk like down quilts , she always screamed as if they had found her true center . I decided that between this retarded whore freak and the riffraff who stood in line to fuck her some really important sacrament was taken , some means of continuing with hope , a ritual oath of life which did not wear away but grew in the memory of her around the bars and taverns of the mountains , catching her image in the sawdust flying up through the sunlight in the mill yards or lying like the mist of the morning over the clear lakes . On the other hand it was common knowledge in the carney that fat ladies were the biggest draw . I got along with all the freaks , I made a point to . It was as if I had to acclimate myself to the worst there was . I never let them see that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important not to act like a rube After a while they stopped I(x)king at Inc with the carney eyes and  | forgot I was there . Some , the Living Oyster for instance , were taken care of by members of their families who lived with them and probably got them their jobs in the first place . There was about them all , freaks and family , such competence that you almost wondered how normal people got along . There was a harmony of malformation and life that could only scare the shit out of you if you thought about it . The freaks read the papers and talked about Roosevelt , just like everyone else in the country . But with all of that they lived invalid lives , as someone in the pain of constant hopeless bad health , and so their dispositions were seldom sunny . The Fingerlings were mean little bastards , they were not really a family but who could tell ? They all had these little pug faces . They used to get into fights all the time and only the dwarf could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What she had done to arouse their wrath I never knew . They liked to sneak up on her and pull out tufts of her hair . " That 's all right , " they screamed , scuttling out of her way . " Plenty more where that came from ! " And every day the rubes paid their money to see them and then went off and took a chance on Fortune 's wheel . I had great respect for Sim Hearn . He was the owner of the enterprise . He was pretty strange himself , a tall thin man who walked with a stoop . Even the hottest days of the summer he wore an old gray fedora with the brim pulled way down , and a white-on-white shirt with a black tie and rubber bands around the sleeves above the elbows . He had stick arms . He was always sucking on his teeth , alighting on a particular crevasse with his tongue and then pulling air through it . Cheeup cheeup ! If you wanted to know where Hearn was on the lot , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing your work and you 'd realize it was you he was watching , the cheeup cheeup just behind your ear , as if he 'd landed on your shoulder . You 'd turn and there he 'd be . He 'd point at what he wanted done with his chin . " That , " he 'd say . He was a stingy son of a bitch even with his words . I was fascinated by him . Sucking his teeth and never speaking more than he had to gave him an air of preoccupation , as if he had weightier matters on his mind than a fifth-rate carney . But he knew his business , all right . I Ic knew what towns to skip , he knew what games would go in  | one place but not another , and he knew when it was time to pull up stakes . We were a smooth efficient outfit under Sim Hearn . He 'd go on ahead to find the location and make the payoff . And when we drove into town he 'd be waiting where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A with one arm out the window , the rubber band around the shirt sleeve . His real genius was in freak dealing . Where did he get them ? Could they be ordered ? Was there a clearing house for freaks somewhere ? There really was  --  a theatrical agency in New York on lower Broadway . But if he could , Sim Hearn liked to find them himself . People would come up to him and he 'd go with them to see what was hidden in the basement or the barn . If he liked what he saw , he named his terms and did n't have to pay a commission . Maybe he had dreams of finding something so inspiring that he 'd make his fortune , like Barnum . But to the afflicted of the countryside , he was a chance in a million . I 'd go to work one morning and see some grotesque I had n't seen before , not necessarily in costume at show time but definitely with the carney . Sometimes they did n't want to display themselves in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lacking or maybe he had n't figured out how best to show them . They required some kind of seasoning , like rookie ballplayers , to give them their competence as professionals . One would be around awhile and disappear just as another would show up , I think they were traded back and forth among the different franchises of this mysterious league . But when a new freak was introduced , that evening everyone would shine , the new one would tone them all up in competitive awareness , except for Fanny , secure and serene in her mightiness.  | Herewith bio the poet Warren Penfield .

He liked to see underwear drying on the line the wind animating it to a maniac dance . Sometimes he thought of the flapping long johns as a desperate signaling of imprisoned or tortured people . He was absorbed by the sun rising and the sun setting or the rain when it fell from rock to rock . He was excited by any kind of violence , a parent hitting a child a man hitting a woman .

I grabbed the money from the bureau . I unlatched the door quietly and closed it behind me . There were no other guests at the Pine Grove Motor Court . A thin frost lay on the window of her car . The wind blew . I threw the bills into the wind . I found a privy up the hill behind the cabins and next to it an outdoor shower , the kind you pumped the water for yourself . I stood in the shower of cold spring water and looked up at the swaying tops of the pine trees and I watched the sky turning gray and heard through the water and the toneless wind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as best I could and put on my clothes . Shivering , stippleskinned , I struck off through the woods . I had no idea where I was going . It did n't matter . I ran to get warm . I ran into the woods as to another world . All morning I went up and down the hills of timber . Sometimes I 'd hear the sound of a truck or a car and it would shock me . I 'd veer off to get as deep in the woods as possible . It was difficult to keep my sense of  | direction , difficult to put life behind me . I 'd come along into a clearing and find the remains of a fire or an empty wine bottle . Traces of human life everywhere : stone fences , old trails , dirt roads grown over . I found a busted inner tube , yellowed sheets of newspaper with dates on them from the early summer . But I saw no one : any stiff in his right mind would get out of the Adirondacks before autumn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course and went downhill till I found a paved road . I walked along the tree line for several miles and came to a country store with a gas pump and some chickens in a coop .

The carney was a territory in my mind . It loomed out further than I had gone or maybe could go . There were no cars . I slid down the embankment of loose earth behind the store and went around front and stepped in the door like any customer . I had my savings of the summer , twenty-six dollars , in my shoes ; in my wallet I carried three dollars more . I bought a loaf of wax-papered bread , some slices of baloney , a bottle of Grade A milk and a package of Luckies .

Then I went to sleep for a while , while the woods were still warm , but it was a mistake because I suffered terrible dreams of indistinct shapes and shadows and awful sounds of violence . Someone was crying , sobbing , and it turned out to be me . I jumped up and got going again . I went deeper and deeper into the woods and sometime at the height of the afternoon wandered into a stand of ancient pine with a porous forest floor of brown pine needles that was so soft you could n't hear your own footsteps . It was dark in here , there was an timber twilight in lieu of the day , and there seemed to be no usual busy life at all , no birds , no insects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could hardly  | find anything green . Yet it was not threatening , the solitude was so complete , the stillness so perfect that I felt as if I had come into some vast , hushed cathedral of peace . Not even a Father . I stopped walking and stood very still and listened for I do n't know what . And then , right in my tracks I sat down and for a while was as still as everything else . I thought of Fanny the Fat Lady 's warm hand on the small of my back . By early afternoon I was traveling again on roads , only jumping off to the side when I heard a car coming , or taking to the woods in order to skirt a town . I went along that day with no destination in mind , no plan of action except to follow the rise , and go for the altitude . I had no food left and did not feel I needed any . I came out to a broad plateau and looking out ahead of me realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my arrogance , had no hope of supper unless I found a farmhouse somewhere . The open ground was uncultivated , mile after mile . I was on a crumbling two-lane road with grass growing in the cracks and this suggested to me the unlikelihood of a ride coming along . Still I kept going . And then with the sun turning red as it dropped toward the evening , I saw to my left , perhaps fifty yards into an open space of tall weed and tangled brush , a single-track railroad embankment . Behind the embankment was a curved outcropping of shiny flaked rock . I got up on the embankment for a professional survey : I had happened upon a one-track spur line of some sort . I figured that as it curved in an arc around the rock hill , there was a fair chance it would be going slowly enough to hop . Coming down from the roadbed , I found a bare patch of ground spotted with oil . And beside the charred remains of a fire I saw a flask of clear glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So others had stopped here in their great study of the outdoors  --  it was a station of sorts . I gathered a great bundle of kindling , but I was too tired to build a fire . I lay on my back with my hands behind my head and I watched the sky . The sun had gone down but the sky was still blue , a very pale blue , with a few high clouds still golden with sunlight . Soon I was lying in the dusk and feeling the chill of the evening but the sky was sunlit and blue and so far away in its warmth that I felt I was looking at it from a grave .  | I fell asleep that way and sometime during the night was aroused by a train whistle . I lay there listening for it again in case I had only been dreaming . Again I heard it , this time somewhat closer . I stood up and tried to pound some circulation into my stiff hulk . The train was coming without question now . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starless . I thought I could hear the locomotive . I moved toward the embankment and waited . I could hear the engine clearly now and knew it was moving at a slow speed . The first I saw of it was a diffuse paling of the darkness along the curve of the embankment . Suddenly I was blinded by a powerful light , as if I had looked into the sun . I dropped to my knees . The beam swung away from me in a transverse arc and a long conical ray of light illuminated the entire rock outcropping , every silvery vein of schist glittering as bright as a mirror , every fern and evergreen flaring for a moment as if torched . I rubbed my eyes and looked for the train behind the glare . It was passing from my left to my right . The locomotive and tender were blacker than the night , a massive movement forward of shadow , but there was a passenger car behind them and it was all lit up inside . I saw a porter in a white jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw dark wood paneling , a lamp with a fringed shade , and shelves of books in leather bindings . Then two women sitting talking at a group of wing chairs that looked textured , as if needle-pointed . Then a bright bedroom with frosted-glass wall lamps and a canopied bed and standing naked in front of a mirror was a blond girl and she was holding up for her examination a white dress on a hanger . Oh my lords and ladies and then the train had passed through the clearing and I was watching the red light disappear around the bend . I had n't moved from the moment the light had dazzled my eyes . I 'd heard of private railroad cars but was not prepared . I was under the impression I would see it again if I waited . I waited . I heard it going down the track and listened until I could n't hear it anymore . Into my vacated mind flowed all the English I never knew I 'd learned at Paterson Latin Iligh School Grammar slammed into my brain In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more alone and terrified than I knew it was possible to be . I got a fire going and made it as large as I could , I threw everything I could find into it , it was a damn bonfire and I crouched beside it trying to get warm I made an involuntary sound in my throat for my dereliction , my loneliness , the callow hopes of my life . Who did I think I was ? Where did I think I was going ? What made me think it was worth anything to stay alive ? The fire blazed up . I wanted to get in it . At the first light of the morning I climbed the embankment and set out down the tracks in the direction the train had gone .  | mpare the private railroad car sitting on the Santa Fe siding one night in 1910 in front of the mine near Ludlow Colorado whosf collapsed entry was being dug away by rescue crews . Late at night by the glow of torches they began to bring out the dead hunky miners some so impregnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of considerable significance . Some had been blown to piece : and were assembled on the cold ground by thoughtful colleagues whc matched the torn halves of pants legs or recognized what head wens with what trunk . The boy followed these deliberations and remarkec on the sepulchral interest of assembling pieces of bodies matching anc discarding , trying this arm here that foot there on the dark ground the chill of the October night on the slag hills , the black minera : mountains looming darker than the night sky , the boy noticing the darkening stains around the bodies as blood blacker than coalwater Some miners were brought out intact , uninjured and looking only slightly stunned to have breathed all the available air until there wa !  | no more . Some faces had the look of irritability that comes when something small has gone wrong . Others had eyes rolled into their heads in exasperation others had sorrowed into death and by some curious self-embalmment of the skin left the tracks of their tears like shining falling stars through their grizzled faces . The rescue work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine and like the miners of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company , and in the car a self-sufficient unit with bedrooms kitchen small library and a row of partners ' desks were three or four officers of the firm some in gartered shirt sleeves efficiently dealing with the wives making settlements pushing waivers across their desks proffering pens matching the tally sheets to the employment records and in general dealing so efficiently with the disaster that the mine would be back in action within the week . The only thing that threatened this work performance was the occasional embittered woman who would come in screaming and tearing her hair and cursing them in her own language . They would ncxl to one of the private peace officers and the troublesome woman would he removed . Gradually in his inspection of the disaster the boy found his way into the car and in the moment before he was ejected he observed one of the company officers , a stolid man impassively wiping the spittle from his cheek . The brass plate at his desk informed the boy of F. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of the armed guard on his neck and then the coolness of the night air as he flew from the top of the rail-car step to the graveled ground . His knee was embedded with bits of stone as the miners had been peppered with coal fragments , so he understood that feeling . To understand what it meant to be buried alive in a mountain he sat later with his eyes closed in the night and his hands over his cars and he held his breath as long as he could .  | Every day to school she wore her faded dress of flowers , horizontal lines of originally cheery little tulips row upon row . It came below her knees and there the cast off shoes , boots practically , hook-and-eye boots all cracked and curled , there the boots began , and so nothing of her was uncovered except the neck above the high collar of frazzled lace , and the wrists and the hands and the incredible face that struck my heart like a jolt every time I raised my eyes to look at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't it . I used to wake up before dawn and wait impatiently for the light to come into the window so that I could jump out of bed and get ready for school . I would sit on the front wooden step and wait for her to come down the canyon . She would smile when she saw me . Were you her best friend ? We were each other 's only friend . Her English was very bad . The theory of the teacher with all these immigrant kids was that if you spoke English loudly enough they would eventually understand . They all sat there with their immense eyes and watched her every move . They never  | smiled , even when she scratched her head with her pencil and her wig moved up and down on her forehead . She taught them the pledge of allegiance phonetically . I would like to have known you then . You would not believe it , Lucinda , but I was very sensual . I believe it . No , you 're smiling . But I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that even the daylight sifting through a cloud would give me enormous shuddering response . My friend and I used to play after school in the hills above town . The sun would go down behind the Black Hills but we 'd see it to the east still on the plains , moving away from us on the flat plains , racing away in a broad front like an army losing territory on a map . In the shadow in some gully or behind some rock she 'd lie in my arms and look at me with her dark eyes , frightened and speechless by our strange intimacy , frightened but not spooked . She could say my name but not much else . She rolled the rr 's . Wadden . Light me a cigarette , will you ? Is this boring ? No , it makes me sad , though . I know what happened . I have in my life just three times seen faces in dark light , at dusk , or at dawn , or against a white pillow in which the fear of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension , that it encompassed its opposite and became the gallantry to break your heart . Go on . One day I remember late in the summer , before we all had to leave Ludlow for the flats , we were playing up there at some run-off . Some black-water run-off falling off the rocks somehow , so filthy with coal dust that just putting your hand in it was enough to dye yourself black . She did n't want to get her one and only dress wet , she 'd get a beating for that , so she tied it up around her waist and hunkered there by the stream to play . She was n't as old as I. She was a younger person . She wore nothing underneath . It was very lovely . Because I had become still she became still . She let me touch her . Shc let me run nay hand over her small hack . I could feel the hones in her ass . I could feel the heat under her skinny thighs .  | Was this when you became lovers ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or another , I remembe that it happened , but I do n't remember the experience of it . What is tha up ahead , Lucinda ? It looks very dark . It 's nothing . A line squall. eave said his father and they swung the wooden chest up on the wagon bed . Now make it fast . He pushed up with his hands landed lightl ; on one knee and stood up beside the chest and worked it firmly between the bureau and the slatted side gate . He glanced up the canyon . They wen coming along steadily now , mule-drawn wagons like his own or the two wheeled handcarts which required the woman to throw her entire weigh stiff-armed on the handle to keep it from rising and the man around the front braking with his bootheels dug into the ground . She was nowhere in sight . The sky was heavy almost black , it felt like evening although it wasn ' yet noon . A fine drizzle misted on the skin and made everything slipper ' to hold . Each drop of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoi rubbed the water on the back of your hand it smeared black . Hey hi father shouted keep your wits boy ! He nearly fell backward as a cardboarc box hit him in the chest . He grabbed it . His mother came out of the house with her arms full of pots and pans . His parents went in and out of thi door bringing him things which he found a place for on the wagon bed Gradually he realized he was constructing the model of a city . Seen fron a distance , the boxes and headboards and chairs and chests were the skyline of some glorious Eastern city , the kind he had seen in the rotogra vure , New York maybe , or St. Louis . I have a comment here : I note the boy Warren Penfield 's relentles  | faculty of composition . Rather than apprehend reality he transforms it so that in this case , for example , in the eviction of the striking miners from the Colorado Fuel Company 's houses , the pitiful pile of his family 's belongings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder his father is angered by his constant daydreaming . Jack Penfield perceives it as mental incompetence . How he wonders will his son survive the harshness of this life when he the father and she the mother are no longer there to protect him ? As to book learning , Warren can do that passably well , but as to plain good sense the character of his mind is not reassuring . Neda Penfield takes a different view but not without some irritation that the boy does n't give her more support for it . Her view is that he is a rare soul , a finer being either than herself or her husband . By some benign celestial error he was born to them and to their life of slag who would more properly have been the child of a wealthy family going to the finest schools and with every material and intellectual advantage . He gives her qualms of course but she nourishes a private and barely articulated conviction that he is not deficient only latent , that his strength is there but still wrapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is ripe . When will the time be ripe ? His hands and feet are large and clumsy , he looms next to her sometimes like a giant he is at that stage of life when the largeness of him seems to wax and wane according to his own rhythms of confidence . She is aware as mothers are of the changes in him the manhood beginning to shine and she is comforted . But the wisdom of him has still to appear . Sometimes the light will hit his amber eye and she will feel ill at ease , as if she is living with two men rather than a man and a boy . Perhaps Jack Penfield feels this too and anticipates the revolt of his son , the loosening of his power over him the freeing of his son from himself till he has nothing but himself and then inevitably he will be subjected to his son 's power over him . Yet he is secretly proud too and likes the boy 's good looks . Warren is gentle and distracted as ever only his ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to come . Neda Penfield would like Warren to win some sort of scholarship and go away to the city to study . She wants this desperately even though she  | knows her life with her husband then would be hell . Jack Penfield want Warren in the mines . He wants him in the mines to establish such rag that he will finally be in contact with the circumstances of his life , he wi wake up to it . And then see what happens , then see what glorious flight of power and genius the boy has in him perhaps to become an organize a great union orator a radical a leader of men out of their living grave of coal . Let the boy work in a crouch for ten hours hacking coal in th chilling blackness of the earth , crouching with his feet in brackish wate not knowing which bite of the pick will bring the roof down on him . L ( him work for his three tons a day and bring them up to be short-weighte by the company . Then my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of my line . The wagon loaded , Warren gives a hand up to his father and after moment the two of them teetering on the gate , he nimbly leaps down an suffers the inspection of his work . The father pushes this adjusts that br says nothing , which is the highest approval . Together they tie everythin in a web of stout rope , Warren running around from one side of the wago to the other hauling tight looping knotting and he thinks of a wonderft bridge with granite towers and steel suspension cables what bridge is tha And then his mother comes out of the house her hands empty but fc a summer straw hat , a wide-brimmed straw with a round crown , and nc seeing any place to put it she places it on her head . It is such a gallar gesture , so incongruous with the rain and the state of their fortunes the the two men look at her startled and she pulls her shoulders back an defies them with her glance , her face peculiarly shadowed by the brim if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh because both hav perceived in one shimmering instant before the fact of her wearing thhat is established , the still alive girl and the undefeated kingdom of the family . She took her place on the bench and looked straight ahead over th mule 's rump . Jack Penfield went into the house and came out with th last thing , his new bolt-action Savage whose stock was oiled smooth an whose barrel was blue steel , and he placed this across his lap as he sat u behind the mule and took the reins . And so with a lurch of the wheels they turned into the traffic of wagon  | winding down through the canyons . In front of the Colorado Supply Company two sheriff 's deputies stood on the porch to watch the procession . They had Winchesters cradled in their arms . Some of the families passing them made loud remarks . Some of them sang their union song . Most of them looked straight ahead and went on down the street into the descent of the prairie , too cold or too realistic to bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing its nature , getting heavy turning hard , and Warren sitting cross-legged on top of a bureau felt the sting of ice , like steel pellets . He held out his hand and received a particle of hail . He put up his denim collar . He was facing forward but for some reason swiveled on his rump and looked back at the street just as the wagon behind picked up the pace to fill in the slack in the parade and it was she in her dress of tulips faded sitting up on her wagon on a stool like a princess borne in her palanquin , her body moving forward and back , her head moving in the lag of her body 's rhythm and he smiled and raised his hand and she smiled and raised hers , and they stared at each other their bodies gently bending and straightening in the rhythm of the mules ' pace , the wheels creaking in the mud the traces rattling like ancient music of fanfares and the two of them staring at each other like royal lovers in a procession toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slag going down to the plains.  | Thinking about that girl standing in front of the mirror and holding i the white dress on the train gliding past me out of sight , I came alo the track before I even knew it into the main street of a mountain villa ? It was noon on the church tower . A pretty lakeside village with a gene store a gas pump a white hotel with rocking chairs on the porch , bait-and-tackle shop . I wanted to keep going but there was a cop on t corner . Casually I crossed the street and went into a diner and order , the baked ham and brown beans in a crock and coffee . When I finish , I ordered the same thing again . The waitress smiled and the chef himsi looked out through the porthole of the kitchen door to see this pri customer . I got out of that village without trouble resuming my walk just beyoi the station crossing , following the rails that forked off into a narrower c of trees . The track went through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up a grade a long slow winding grac I was not already in love with her but in her field of force , what I thong  | I felt like was some stray dog following the first human being it happened to see . In the late afternoon I came to a miniature station house of creosoted brown logs complete with ticket window and potbellied stove . It was empty . Out the back door was the sidetracked private railroad car . I climbed aboard . Each room had a narrow door with brass handle opening onto the corridor going down one side along the windows . Here was the room of grand appointments where the men were drinking a card table of green baize and leather with receptacles for poker chips , a bar with bottles and glasses in fitted recesses , a Persian rug of rich red tone , paneling of dark wood , books in the shelves The Harvard Classics . A faint odor of cigar smoke . I brushed the tassels of the lampshades with the back of my hand . Everything in this room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of the night , for it was quite clearly owned . That was the main property of the entire car , not that it was handsome or luxurious but that it was owned . In the girl 's bedroom I sat on the plump mattress newly made up with fresh sheets thick quilt of satiny material there was no sign of her of course not a thread not a bobby pin but as I thought about it the faintest intimation of a scent , a not unfamiliar scent , I inhaled deeply , a variety common enough to have previously informed the nostrils of a derelict somewhere before in his wandering one summer night in the carney perhaps . The afternoon light came through the window at a low angle between the trees it suddenly faded the car darkened I left . Outside , the sky was showing stars as it does earlier than you think it should in the last of the summer . I was so blue . I was sorry I 'd found the car , if I had n't found it I could have thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now I felt let-down stupid at a loss what to do . The breeze had a chill and I supposed I could n't do better going back as I 'd come , so I followed the one road from the small station as it ran uphill into the woods . Long before I got there , probably from the moment I left the village , I 'd been on private property . They were the same hills and forest and  | stone of the natural world , they looked like the Adirondacks , but I was walking in fact on a map of fixed color , crimson perhaps . The road inclined gradually around the side of a mountain , one side dropping away to show the darkening sky . And then , below , a broad lake came into view , a lake glittering with the last light of the day . I stopped to look at it . Something was moving , making a straight line of agitation , like a tear , in the surface . A moment later a bird was rising slowly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distance but only against the silver phosphorescence of the water . When it rose as high as the land it was gone . The rest of my survey I made in darkness , by the light of stars . I had come on some isolated reservation , and its center was a cluster of buildings on the mountain overlooking this same lake : a lodge of two stories , and several smaller outbuildings , barns , stables , garages . Even in darkness I could tell that the buildings , like the little station house at the bottom of the trail , were uniformly of log construction . My vantage point was from the land side , a rise in an enormous rolling meadow beside a tennis court fenced in wood and mesh . I did not try to move closer to see in detail what was in the light of the lodge windows , all ablaze everywhere , as if great crowds were inside . I knew there were no crowds . The wind amplified in gusts the strains of a dance band . When the song was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tune I recognized , " Exactly Like You . " The perverse effect of this music and the lighted windows was of a repellent and desolate isolation . Now the wind came up stronger across the meadow , it was off the lake and carried the water 's chill . I looked up to the treetops of the wood behind me and saw them prancing and bucking in the way of a hard life of eminence . I was fixed by my own pride from going to the back door of this establishment and asking for a place to stay or a meal . I did n't know if I had the stamina for a night on these grounds , but it was as if I was reflecting the clear arrogance of whoever owned this place and traveled to it by imperial railroad , for I was goddamned if I would ask him or them fo : anything . I did n't want her to see me like this !  | I remember squatting behind the little tennis shack and keeping myself company with my cigarettes . I smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I 'll tell what I do n't remember . I do n't remember the sound they must have made , the uncanny sound as it separated itself from the wind in the trees , of group exertion , breath chuffing across twenty or thirty hanging tongues , yelps of murderous excitement . Was the moon out ? I rose from my crouch seeing something like an earthwave coming toward me , as if the ground were advancing in a sort of rolling quaking upheaval . This gradually distinguished itself as the furred musculature of shoulders and chests and legs , and I think now I must have seen the face of the lead dog , flung into moonlight , its maddened red eyes like the tracers of those launched fangs . If I did n't see it I 've dreamed it a thousand times . Goddamnit , if city boys knew any animals at all it was dogs . But these were like nothing I 'd ever seen . Not that I had the leisure for contemplation . I held up my forearm and his teeth tore it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the tennis shack . And then the others were up , tossing themselves at me in their fury but with great inefficiency , they turned on each other snarling for getting in each other 's way though they were effective enough to my pain and screaming terror . I was kicking at them and flinging them off going for the throat trying to tear my throat out , I was kicking and waving my arms and fists and howling like a dog myself and knowing that if I went down I faced something more than the end of my life  --  shit  --  the extenuated appreciation of its end , piecemeal , my life taken from me chunk by chunk drop by drop every nerve shrieking . I think I can imagine some faint memory of the odor of those dogs , feel the closeness of their life , their wild heartbeat ! I hear their snorts and the snaps of teeth on air , I remember the toothtumblers lock once the flesh is found , the quick release and regrip down to the bone . I recall without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maniac life beyond all appeal . Somehow I was vaulted or inspired upward in some acrobatic backward tumble through the unframed shack window . I t(x)k one of the dogs with me , slamming it fixed in my wrist against the inner wall of the shack while  | the heads of the others appeared outside the window , a fountain of face leaping and falling back in rage in frustration . But then one gripped tl. sill with its paws and began to pull itself up till its own weight would g ( it inside , I grabbed a tennis racquet hanging in its press and swung towai that head down on those paws . The dog fell out of sight and the othe who had come in with me , stunned loose from its slam against the wal I now caught on the back with the racquet edge in its heavy press an broke its spine . They were not uniformed pedigreed hounds , they we every kind and make , and this one , a smaller mongrel , I lifted howling an threw to the others . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grunt of appeasement , the soft sound of flesh being fanged . The small moonl square of night I saw from the floor of the shack was peaceful with star Maybe I heard human voices , or the firing of a rifle or a gun , but I 'm nc sure . I lay there and as the blood flowed from me I lost consciousness  | Adirondacks . Region first known for wilderness industries trapping hunting . Earliest roads were logging trails out came the great trees chained to sledges . In the winter blocks of ice were sawn from the frozen lakes and carried in procession on funicular tracks uphill to the railroad depots for shipment to the cities . In early spring the tapping of the huge sugar maples and the sap houses sweet blue smoke hanging over the green valleys . In summer the natives grew small corn and picked wild berries and grilled trout on open fires by the edge of rock rivers . But one summer after the May flies painters and poets arrived who paid money to sit in guide boats and to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poets patrons seeing and hearing their reports bought vast tracts of the Adirondacks very cheaply and began to build elaborate camps there thus inventing the wilderness as luxury . I Soon fake a high mountain retreat cratered as purely cold and clear in the mountains as water cupped in your lianas.  | In the morning the old man , Bennett , gave them all woclen ponchos and took them for a speedboat ride on the lake . She sat up front between him and Tommy . Tommy put his arm around her but she preferred to lean forward in the lee of the windshield where she avoided the wind if not the cold space it left as it blew by . The little flag in the stern flapped like a machine gun . In the back seat there was no protection at all and they were truly unhappy . The cigarette was whipped out of Buster 's mouth and taken in the air over the wake by a black-and-white bird , some sort of gull . She saw that , having turned to smile back at them , her knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster , looking startled , saw it too . It seemed to fall away into the sky . He faced her stupidly , his mouth still open and a piece of cigarette paper pasted on his lower lip . She knew Bennett was showing off for her , rearing the mahogany speedboat through the waves as if it were Buck Jones ' Silver . The sky was very low and the tops of the hills around the lake were shrouded in clouds . The clouds drifted through the trees and she was startled by that intimacy . She thought clouds should stay up in the sky where they belonged . They had come to the closed end of the lake . The old man throttled down and the boat settled flatter in the water . There were marshes here and dead striplings poking out of the water . He headed straight for the trees and she felt Tommy clench up until a notch appeared in the shoreline . They went into a channel at slow speed and rode serenely by a beaver lodge of wet dark sticks and mud . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pups inside their lodge lying on shelves just out of reach of the wavelets lapping their feet . Then they were out in an even bigger lake with the hills somewhat farther away and a broad stretch of sky higher over everything . It turned out the old man owned this lake too . She wondered if he trained the crazy bird who came down from the sky for a cigarette .  | ater , in the boathouse , Buster was so relieved at having survived travel -i water that he told everyone about the bird . That was a loon , the old man said , a kind of grebe . They all respectfully ) nsidered this intelligence . You knew that did n't you Buster , Tommy said . They put their ponchos back on the wall pegs and reclaimed their Boras . There were other speedboats in the boathouse , each in its own erth . There were racks with wooden canoes . It was a brown log boatouse with casement windows in the same style as the big house up the ill . There was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . She noted how easily he moved up the path , his ack straight , beautiful white hair . These people knew as no one else how take care of themselves . He was dressed for the outdoors , with boots nd a red plaid flannel shirt . She held Tommy 's arm and enjoyed the warmth of the land on her ack . It looked as if the sun might burn through the clouds . She felt good . he felt like dancing . She watched her own feet walking in their strap roes . They were grown-up-looking feet . She was arm in arm with ' ommy , pulling him in close , trying to match strides up the hill . She ' atched his small black wing-tipped shoes pacing along , their shine lined , and the cuffs of his pin-stripe flapping dust from the ground . Up ahead the party was met by a fat guy . He saw her and stood as if : ruck by lightning . He had been coming down to the lake but turned now ' ith another glance at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She held Tommy 's arm , held him back and let them all go out of sight p the hill . You 've got to be joking , Tommy said . She rubbed against him . She kissed him and ran her tongue over his ps and leaned back from him holding her groin against him and looking Ito his eyes right there in the mountains of the Adirondacks.  | Well the kid 's impressed , Tommy said . She nodded while looking into his eyes . The tip of her tongue appeared in the corner of her mouth . He disengaged her arms and stood back from her . That 's how much you know , he said . It 's who , she is , thinks Warren , definitely , now dressed in flimsies and struggling with the torments of her class but it 's her , the same girl , returned to my life , changed in time , true , changed in place , changed let us be honest in character , but how can I doubt my feelings they are all I have I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the indisputable constant , the feeling of recognition I have for her when she appears , the ease with which she comes to me regardless of the circumstances , for I have no particular appeal to women , only to this woman , and so the recognition must be mutual and it pushes us toward each other despite our differences , and our inability to understand each other 's language , and here it has happened again though I am indisputably older fatter and more ridiculous as a figure of love than I have been before . Always I am older . Always we do not understand each other . Always I lose her . Oh God who made this girl give her to me this time to hold let me sink into the complacencies of fulfilled love , let us lose our memories together , and let me die from the ordinary insubstantial results of having lived .  | What he intuits from the coolness of her conversation or the moods that come over her is that she did not expect to find herself in her present situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seems to take each day as it comes and is clearly forged in her being by the race of men she 's had to deal with . In short , they are equals . The realization sends him to the bottle with a shaking hand . Naturally she would think he was part of the old man 's retinue . It was a natural assumption . At drinks that evening they 're alone . Can I tell you a story ? he says . Outside , the rain is heavy , the kind of rain that tamps down the wind . Smoke from the big fireplace drifts into the room like a wisp of cloud come in from the mountains . I 've lived here for six years . I 'm a poet and the Bennetts are my patrons . But I found this place on my own and when I came here it was to kill him . The old man ? Yes . She has to this point only half listened but now he is rewarded by her direct gaze . She sips her Manhattan . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She likes to show herself . I swear to the lordourgod I will make her see who I am .

I have n't got a dime myself , he says conscientiously , as if he 'd made it his life 's achievement . Millions , billions , the power over people . So I was going to kill him . I got through the dogs with just a tear or two and introduced myself out on that terrace there through the dining room one morning with my knife in my pocket . She turns and looks through the big hay windows . She turns hack . But you did n't , she says .  | One night when the dogs are in the neighborhood he takes tw ( wineglasses and a bottle of his table red and closes his door and half walk half runs over to her cottage .

Later they are sitting on the floor beside the bed . He has been telling her about his life . He has recited some of his work . She has listened ant smoked and held out her glass for wine . Listen , he says holding his hand up , forefinger pointed . The dogs an gone . She smiles and accepts this as something he 's done . Sitting Indiar style , she leans forward and touches his face .

Then she is lying on the floor in his arms reading his face with judicious solemnity , her eyes gathering up the dim light of the room so widely open that he feels himself pouring into them . Because her spirit is strong he is surprised by the frailty of her . She is a small person . Her breasts are ful and her thighs rather short . He can feel her ribs . Her buttocks are hart with a thin layer of sweet softness over them , like a child 's ass . Her mom hair feels lightly oiled . He touches her cunt . She closes her eyes . A queer bitter smell comes off her body . He kisses her soft open mouth and it ' just as he knew , she is here and he 's found her again . Like many large overweight men he has surprising agility .

Yes , she said , as if their fucking had been conversation , sometimes nothing else will do but to drive as flat out hard and fast as you can .  | Annotated text Loon Lake by Warren Penfield . If you listen the small splash is beaver . As beaver swim their fur lies back and their heads elongate and a true imperial cruelty shines from their eyes . They 're rodents , after all . Beaver otter weasel mink and rat a rodent specie of the Adirondacks and they redistrict the world . They go after the young trees and bring them down ? whole hillsides collapse in the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinned poles , mud and boughs like igloos of dark wet wood and they enter and exit under water and build shelves out of the water for the babies . And when the mahogany speedboat goes by trimmed with silver horns in Loon lake , in the Adirondacks ,  | the waves of the lake inside the beaver lodge lap gently against the children 's feet in the darkness . Loon Lake was once the destination of private railroad cars rocking on a single track through forests of pine and spruce and hemlock branches and fronds brushing the windows of cut glass while inside incandescent bulbs flickered in frosted-glass chimneys over double beds and liquor bottles trembled in their recessed cabinet fittings above card tables of green baize in rooms entered through narrow doors with brass latches . If you step on a twig in a soft bed of pine needles under an ancient stand of this wilderness you will make no sound . All due respect to the Indians of Loon Lake the Adirondack nations , with all due respect . What a clear cold life it must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malcontents and every village had its lover whom no one wanted who sometimes lay down because of that with a last self-pitying look at Loon Lake before intoning his death prayers and beginning the difficult business of dying by will on the dry hummocks of pine needles . The loons they heard were the loons we hear today , cries to distract the dying loons diving into the cold black lake and diving back out again in a whorl of clinging water clinging like importuning spirits fingers shattering in spray feeling up the wing along the rounded hcxly of the  | thrillingly exerting loon taking a fish rising to the moon streamlined its loon eyes round and red . A doomed Indian would hear them at night in their diving and hear their cry not as triumph or as rage or the insane compatibility with the earth attributed to birds of prey but in protest against falling of having to fall into that black water and struggle up from it again and again the water kissing and pawing and whispering the most horrible promises the awful presumptuousness of the water squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beak which clamps on them like wriggling fish extruding all organs and waste matter turning the bird inside out which the Indian sees is what death is the environment exchanging itself for the being . And there are stars where that happens too in space in the black space some railroad journeys above the Adirondacks . Well , anyway , in the summer of 1936 a chilling summer high in the Eastern mountains a group of people arrived at a rich man 's camp in his private railway car the men in fedoras and dark double-breasted suits and the women in silver fox and cloche hats sheer stockings of Japanese silk and dresses that clung to them in the mountain air . They shivered from the station to the camp in an open carriage drawn by two horses . It was the clearest night iii the heavens  | and the silhouettes of the jagged pines on the mountaintop in the moonlight looked like arrowheads looked like the graves of heroic Indians . The old man who was their host an industrialist of enormous wealth over the years had welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champions and conductors of major orchestras all of whom were honored to sign the guest book . Occasionally for complicated reasons he received persons strangely undistinguished . His camp was a long log building of two stories on a hill overlooking Loon Lake . There was a great rustic entrance hall with a wide staircase of halved logs and a balustrade made of scraped saplings a living room as large as a hotel lobby with walls papered in birch bark and hung with the mounted heads of deer and elk and with modern leather sofas with rounded corners and a great warming fireplace of native stone big enough to roast an ox . It was a fine manor house lacking nothing with suites of bedrooms each with its own shade porch and the most discreet staff of cooks and maids and porters but designated a camp because its decor was rough-hewn .

And this party of visitors were really romantic gangsters thieves , extortionists and murderers of the lower class and their women who might or might not be whores . The old man welcomed them warmly enjoying their responses to his camp admiring the women in their tight dresses and red lips relishing the having of them there so out of place at Loon Lake . The first morning of their visit he led everyone down the hill to give them rides in his biggest speedboat a long mahogany Chris-Craft with a powerful inboard that resonantly shook the water as she idled . He handed them each a woolen poncho with a hood and told them the ride was fast and cold but still they were not prepared when under way he opened up the throttle  | l the boat reared in the water like Buck Jones ' horse . e women shrieked and gripped the gangsters ' arms l spray stinging like ice coated their faces ile the small flag at the stern snapped like a machine gun . 3 one of the men lipping an unlit cigarette it whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wake ? re a loon appeared from nowhere ked it before it hit the water I rose back into the sky above the mountain . notate boat reared in the water like Buck Jones ' horse as follows : Buck es a cowboy movie star silents 1920S and talkies early 1930s .

And then he brought them in throttling down the boat was awash in a rush of foam the outspread wings of a waterbird coming to rest . other mahogany boats of different lengths berthed in the boathouse racks of canoes and guide boats upside down on walls paddles hanging from brackets fishing rods and snowshoes for some strange reason not a gangster there did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors bigger than the home his family lived in  | when he was a kid , as big as the orphan 's home in fact . But one gangster wanted to know about the lake and its connecting lakes , the distance one could travel on them as if he was planning a fast getaway . Just disappearing around the corner out of sight was the boathouse attendant . And everyone walked up the hill for drinks and lunch . Drinks were at twelve-thirty and lunch at one-thirty after which , returning to their rooms , the guests found riding outfits laid across their beds and boots in their right sizes all new . At three they met each other at the stables laughing at each other and being laughed at and the stableman fitted them out with horses and the sensation was particularly giddy when the horses began to move without warning ignoring them up there in the saddle threatening to launch with each bounce like a paddle ball . And so each day the best gangster among them realized there would be something to do they could not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one was in the lead , the old man was not there . They were alone on these horses who took this wide trail they seemed to know . They were busy maintaining themselves on the tops of these horses stepping with their plodding footfall through the soft earth of the wide trail . By and by proceeding gently downhill they came to another shore of the lake , of Loon Lake , and the trees were cut down here and the cold sun shone . They found themselves before an airplane hangar with a concrete ramp sloping into the water . As the horses stood there the hangar doors slid open there was a luau pushing back each of the steel doors  | although they saw only his arm and hand and shoetops . And then from a gray cloud over the mountain beyond the far end of the lake an airplane appeared and made its descent in front of the mountain growing larger as it came toward them a green-and-white seaplane with a cowled engine and overhead wing . It landed in the water with barely a splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stirred , everyone held on and the lead gangster said whoa boy , whoa boy and the goddamn plane came right out of the water up the ramp , water falling from its pontoons the wheels in the pontoons leaving a wet track on the concrete and nosed up to the open hangar blowing up a cloud of dirt and noise . The engine was cut and the cabin door opened and putting her hands on the wing struts a woman jumped down a slim woman in trousers and a leather jacket and a silk scarf and a leather helmet which she removed showing light-brown hair cut close and she looked at them and nodded without smiling and that was the old man 's wife .

She strode off down the trail toward the big house and they were not to see her again that day neither at drinks which were at six-thirty nor dinner at seven-thirty . But her husband was a gracious host attentive to the women particularly . He revealed that she was a famous aviatrix and some of them recognized her name from the newspapers .

He talked about the unrest in the country and the peculiar mood of the workers and he solicited the gangsters ' views over brandy on the likelihood of revolution . And now he said rising I 'm going to retire . But you 're still young said one of the gangsters . For the night the old man said with a smile I mean I 'm going to bed . Good night . And when he went up the stairs of halved tree trunks they all looked at each other and had nothing to say . They were standing where the old man had left them in their tuxes and black tics.  | They had stood when he stood the women had stood when he stood and quietly as they could they all went to their rooms , where the bedcovers had been turned back and the reading lamps lighted . And in the room of the best gangster there a slim and swarthy man with dark eyes , a short man very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he opened them and stood on the dark porch and heard the night life of the forest and the lake and the splash of the fish terrifyingly removed from Loon Lake . He had long since run out of words for his sickening recognition of real class nervously insisting how swell it was . He turned back into the room . His girl was fingering the hand-embroidered initials in the center of the blanket . They were the same initials as on the bath towels and on the cigarette box filled with fresh Luckies and on the matchbooks and on the breast pockets of the pajamas of every size stocked in the drawers the same initials , the logo .

The gangster 's girl was eighteen and had had an abortion he knew nothing about . She found something to criticize , one thing , the single beds , and as she undressed raising her knees , slipping off her shoes unhooking her stockings from her garters she spoke of the bloodlessness of the rich not believing it while the gangster lay between the sheets in the initialed pajamas arranging himself under the covers so that they were neat and tight as if trying to take as little possession of the bed as possible not wanting to appear to himself to threaten anything . He locked his hands behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even smoking . But at three that morning there was a terrible howl from the pack of wild dogs that ran in the mountains ? not wolves but dogs that had reverted when their owners could n't feed them any longer . The old man had warned them this might happen but the girl crept into the bed of the gangster and he put his arm around her and held her so that she would not slip off the edge and they listened to the howling and then the sound nearer to the house of running dogs , of terrifying exertion and then something gushing  | in the gardens below the windows . And they heard the soft separation together with grunts and snorts and yelps of flesh as it is fanged and lifted from a body . Jesus , the girl said and the gangster felt her breath on his collarbone and smelled the gel in her hair , the sweetness of it , and felt the gathered dice of her shoulders and her shivering and her cold hand on his stomach underneath the waistband . In the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room . Halfway down the hill a handyman pushing a wheelbarrow was just disappearing around a bend in the path . I hope you were n't frightened , the old man said , they took a deer and he turned surprisingly young blue eyes on the best gangster 's girl . Later that morning she saw on the hills in the sun all around Lake Loon patches of color where the trees were turning and she went for a walk alone and in the woods she saw in the orange and yellowing leaves of deciduous trees the coming winter imagining in these high mountains snow falling like some astronomical disaster and Loon Lake as the white hole of a monstrous meteor and every branch of the evergreens all around described with snow , each twig each needle balancing a tiny snowfall precisely imitative of itself . And at dinner she wore her white satin gown with nothing underneath to ruin the lines . And the old man 's wife came to dinner this night clearly younger than her husband , trim and neat with small beautifully groomed hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mouth  | She talked to them politely with no condescension and showed them in glass cases in the game room trophies of air races she had won small silver women pilots silver cups and silver planes on pedestals . Then still early in the evening she said good night and that she had enjoyed meeting them . They watched her go . And after the old man retired and all the gangsters and their women stood around in their black ties and tuxes and long gowns the best gangster 's girl saw a large Victrola in the corner of the big living room with its leather couches and grand fireplace the servants spirited away the coffee service and the gangster 's girl put on a record and commanded everyone to dance . And they danced to the Victrola music they felt better they did the fox trot and went to the liquor cabinet and broke open some Scotch and gin and they danced and smoked the old man 's cigarettes from the boxes on the tables and the only light came from the big fire and the women danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuzzled their shoulders and their new shoes made slow sibilant rhythms on the polished floors as they danced in their tuxes and gowns of satin at Loon Lake at Loon Lake in the rich man 's camp in the mountains of the Adirondacks.  | He was a whistling wonder with his face and arms and legs in bandages and bandages crisscrossed like bandoliers across his chest . Every now and then they looked in on him with the same separation of themselves from the sight as rubes looking at the freaks . They all wore green . They told him the dog packs were well known in the region , several of them told him that , as if it were a consolation . He had difficulty speaking through his pain and swollen tissue , so that they could not be exactly sure what he thought of them and their fucking dogs . The elderly country doctor was eager to see what complication might set in to try him beyond the resources of his medicine . There were pills for the pain but I took as few as I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what was going on . Maybe I thought the dogs would come back . The room was damp . There was a small window high on the wall . I was in the basement of one of the log buildings I 'd seen and it seemed to me not a very safe place to be . Also it was as had as the original event to dream of it again drugged in a kind of dream prison and struggling for consciousness . Pain was better . It came  | in spasms and with the sharp point of imprinted teeth , it tore along clawing sweeps down my chest and seemed sometimes to raise the ban ages from the skin . I tried to consider it objectively , like a scientist sittii in a white coat looking through a microscope . Ahh , peering at each lit ' cellpoint of pain . Remarkable ! And since I was in pain , I thought of my mother and father . I thong of myself bedridden in Paterson . They look at me lying there flushed ar wheezing , a boy impossibly exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at their machines . A man looked in on me each morning and made a grunt of disgust scorn just like my father had although heavyset not at all like my thin ar gaunt father but in the same role , with the same wordless eloquence . Iwore a kind of uniform of dark green shirt and matching pants . And for my mother a woman in pale green uniform and white sho and opaque brown hose with a thick seam down the back . An impassi ' porky being with hands that worked at high speed setting down tra pounding pillows carrying off urinals while she thought her own thought I could tell that each of them felt badly used to be taking care of son tramp who had wandered onto the grounds . It was an affront to tl natural order which made service to people bearable because they we higher than you , not lower . I responded with a pride of my own which asked for nothing and ga ' as little indication of need as possible . And I never thanked them f anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into tf province of wealth , I had adopted its customs . Or perhaps it was mo serious , perhaps it had been injected in the saliva of the dogs . On the other hand I had only the word of these people that the do did n't belong to the owner of this place . And even if they did n't , the certainly ran to his advantage . My rage flared as if it were the last worn to be felt and the slowest to heal . As time went on I understood that I lay in a room of the staff hou where perhaps fifteen or twenty people lived who wore the green live ' forest-green for the outdoor workers , the paler shade for the indoor . Th all looked somewhat stolidly alike , as if related . I was alert to find a friend and I did . She was a girl of the pale grei  | set , a young maid in the big house who shyly looked in on me , advancing each time a little farther into the room until finally she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . She had seen we were the same age and that was enough . Her name was Libby . She did n't think of not answering any question that occurred to me . This place was called Loon Lake . It was the domain of the same F. W. Bennett of the Bennett Autobody Works . Did I know the name ? He was very rich . He owned thirty thousand acres here and it was just one of his places . He owned the lake itself , the water in the lake , the land under the water and the fish that swam in it . " But not the dogs , " I said . " Oh no , " she said , " those are wild-running , those dogs . It 's the fault of the people who own them and ca n't feed them anymore . And then they go off and forage and breed wild and hunt in packs . " " The people ? " " The dogs . All through the mountains it 's like that , not just here . Does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickle . " A tremor went through her . She held her arms as if she was cold . " Tell me , does your F. W. Bennett have a wife ? " " Oh , sure ! She 's famous . The Mrs. Bennett who wins all the air races . Her picture 's in the papers . Lucinda Bennett ? " " Oh , her , " I said . " The one with the blond hair ? " " No , she 's a brunette . " Libby touched her own hair , which was brunet too . Like all her features it was ordinary . She was possessed of a sort of plain prettiness that caused you to study her and wish this feature or that might be better . " Brunettes are my favorite , " I said . She blushed . She was a simple innocent person , she granted me her own youthful face on the world without knowing who I was or where I came from . In five minutes I had her whole history . Her uncle , one of the groundkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a week plus room and board . She was fervent in her gratitude . She spoke iii what I could tell was the communal piety of the staff . I low nervously lucky they  | would have to feel , how clannish in their good fortune exempt in the mountains from an afflicted age . Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett came went separately or together or had guests or did n't , but the place w maintained all year round including the dead of winter . " Do n't you get lonely up here ? " I said . She thought a long time . " Well , I send six dollars to my father Albany . " Not realizing this was enough for me to feel chastened , she frown ( and cast about in her mind for justification . " You 'd be surprised wl comes here , " she said . She brightened " You get to see famous people " Who ? " " Why , big politicians , and prime ministers from England . And Jea ette MacDonald ? She was here in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave me five dollars ! " " Who else ? " " Oh well , I never saw him , it was before I came . But Charlie Chaplin " Sure , " I said . " On roller skates . " She looked then suddenly frightened . Who would doubt her word ? SI turned and left the room , and I thought to myself well that 's that . B a short while later she returned , softly closing the door behind her . SI held a large leatherbound book to her chest and looked at me over ti gilt edge with bright excited eyes . " I better not get caught , " she saic It was the Loon Lake guest book . She fixed the pillows so I could pi myself up and she sat on the side of the bed and opened the book to page marked " 1931 . " Her index finger ran down a list of signatures at stopped and she turned her eyes on me as I saw whose signature it w Charles Chaplin had made an elegant scrawl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment , he had written : " Splendid weekend ! G company ! " Vindicated , Libby watched with pleasure as I became absorbed by the names , right up to the present : signatures of movie stars , orchest leaders , authors , senators , all famous enough to be recognized by me , b also signatures I recognized only vaguely , or only sensed as names magnitude , like the name F. W. Bennett , names that had been given things , naives painted on the big signs over factories or carved in the sto  | over the entrances of office buildings . I could n't stop looking at them . I felt I could learn something , that there was something here , some powerful knowledge I could use . But it was in code ! If only I could understand the significance of the notations , I 'd have what I needed I 'd know what I 'd always dreamed of knowing  --  although I could n't have said what it was . I touched the signatures , traced them trying to feel the ink . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant endeavor  --  all abbreviated into these names and dates of proud people from all over the world who had come here to this secret place in the mountains . I became aware of this girl Libby in her pale green uniform . She sat very close to me , the starched front of her uniform rose and fell with her breathing . When I glanced up from the book I found her face near mine , her head bowed and her eyes on the page , but her consciousness all directed to me . Her full lower lip was impressed into a suggestion of voluptuousness by her front teeth . She had thick wavy hair . What sweet appropriate modesty of being . Her trust was part of it , or so I understood ? the willingness of the others of us to find a place and live our lives within it , making our trembling alliances and becoming famous and powerful to each other . I turned back to the book . Some of the people there were such big shots they needed only one name to identify themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgium . I said to Libby , " Hey , how long have I been here , anyway ? " " We were taking off the summer covers and putting the rugs down , " she said . " It was that night . I never hope to hear what I heard that night . " " Well , when was it , please ? " " Two weeks ago . " " Was n't someone here then ? Did n't you have visitors ? " She looked at me and then looked away . She glanced at the book . She wanted it back . " I saw the train , Libby . People were on it . Is anyone here now ? " She shook her head . " Well , how conic I do n't see anything that recent in the guest hook ? " She was silent a long while . I knew I was extending her loyalty . I gazed  | at her and waited for my answer . She looked discouraged . " Not ju anyone gets to sign , " she said finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't look at me now . " I think someone 's calling you , Libby . " " Where ? " She went to the door , opened it and listened . I leaned ova with a painful lunge to the bedside stand . In the little drawer was fountain pen . I unscrewed the cap , shook a blot on the floor , spread opc the guest book and signed my name with a flourish . " What are you doing ! " Libby said . Her hand was on her cheek and slstared at me in horror . " Joe , " I wrote . " Of Paterson . Splendid dogs . Swell company . " I fell back on the pillow . By signing the guest book , did I mean to be goir on my way ? I felt the pretense , as well as any other , washed away in a waN of weakness and despair . The girl grabbed the book and ran . She had a friend , as it turned out , a man who lived on the grounds a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that da peering in the door with an expression of wonder very odd in a full-grow middle-aged adult .

His weig and size seemed to amplify the act of breathing , which took place throw his mouth . His nose looked swollen , a web of fine purple lines ran up h cheeks from the undergrowth , and all the ravage together told of tl drinker . He said his name was Warren Penfield . He wanted to speak aboi moral responsibility . He padded around the room in a pair of old tennis sneakers . He wo baggy trousers belted below his stomach , and an ancient tweed jacket wi patches at the elbow . Beneath the jacket was what seemed to be a sc graying tennis shirt part of the collar folded under he did n't seem to 1 aware of this .  | " I can understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend my life understanding feelings , yes , my own and others , that 's what I do , that 's what poets do , that 's what they 're supposed to do . " " You 're a poet ? " " I 'm the poet in residence here , " he said , drawing himself up slightly trying to tuck his shirt in glancing then at me from the corner of his eye . I thought I would never know the end of the subtle luxuries with which the wealthy provided themselves . " So I can understand your feelings . But I also understand poor Libby 's , good God she 's one of the few decent people around here , and now she 's in fear for her job . Do you realize what it would mean for her to lose her job ?

I was smiling I was admitted into his realm of moral concern without passport credentials references of any sort . There I was a hobo boy lying on this cot in this weird place suppurating , for all he knew , in my dereliction , not a pot to pee in , and he was trying to recall me to my honor . He assumed I had it ! He saw me smiling and started to smile too . Then we were laughing . " Of course it was wicked , a good wicked joke , God knows I can enjoy a joke at his expense . I wish there were more of them . Incidentally . I 've studied him a long time . He 's a very capable human being . Quite charming at times . The mistake most people make is to jump to conclusions before they even meet him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said and we laughed again .

" I saw that he suffered from this , as from everything , in a state of expressive self-magnifying complaint . " Well , I suppose I should go . How do you feel , by the way ? " " Lousy .

Something has leaked out through the stitches and some of the serious intention of the world has leaked in : like the sense of high stakes , the desolate chance of real destiny . There was a distant railroad track with telephone poles regularly spaced down the side of my neck over the clavicle across the breastbone . There was another spur line on either arm and the right leg . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus I found myself on a brilliant morning raking leaves in the shadow of the great sprawling lodge house of the auto magnate F. W.

I felt weak in the knees , I could n't have gone anywhere anyway . I w glad to hold on to the rake . The lodge house was two stories on the land side , three on the lake sid ? the land dropped precipitously from the crest of the hill  --  and its wal were logs , uniformly brown , set with casement windows and crowned wit a wood shingle roof of many angles and regularly spaced dormers . Th trees oak maple elm , and though it was still September , a heavy leaf fa everywhere behind the meadow of my encounter , a burning wood orange and gold and behind this on a distant mountain , ageless stands evergreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was warm on my back . The air 1 , w sweet . I felt better . I was one of three or four workmen . A small truc with slat sides moved slowly among us to receive our leaves . We move around to the back of the house and swept the leaves from two terrace , the upper with tables and chairs for dining , the lower with cushione wooden wheeled lounge chairs for the view and the sun . The lake out there a definite mountain lake , a water cupped high i the earth , its east and west shores hidden from view by intervening hill its south shore across the water filled with pine and spruce that rose u straight on the mountainside in a kind of terror . The lake glittered with fragments of sun , and flying over it were couple of large black-and-white loons , big as swans . There was a boathou5 down at the water in the same style as the main house . A dock goin around the boathouse . A swimming float fifty yards out . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden wild things , and through its paths we raked away the unwanted leavf from the bushes and plants . I looked back up the hill to the house and felt the imposition of a enormous will on the natural planet . Stillness and peace , not the soun of a car or a horn or even a human voice , and I felt Loon Lake in i isolation , the bought wilderness , and speculated what I would do if I ha  | the money . Would I purchase isolation , as this man had ? Was that what money was for , to put a distance of fifty thousand acres of mountain terrain between you and the boondocks of the world ? The man made automobile bodies , and they were for connection , cars were democracy we had been told . The wind rose in a sudden gust about my ears , and as I looked back to the lake , a loon was coming in like a roller coaster . He hit he water and skidded for thirty yards , sending up a great spray , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see him , I thought the fucker had drowned . But up he popped , shaking and mauling a fat fish . And when the fish was polished off , I heard a weird maniac cry coming off the water , and echoing off the hills . A while later I followed the workers going along the hillside with their rakes through the trees past the stables to the staff house for lunch . The people of the light and dark green ate in a sort of bunkhouse dining room with long tables and benches . The food was put out on compartmented metal trays as in a cafeteria . Fifteen , twenty of them looking at me as I hesitated with my tray and then slid into a place next to Libby , who smiled and looked with some satisfaction to the rest of the table . I was inspected by a heavyset man with thick black eyebrows I took to be the uncle she had mentioned . I gave back a clear-eyed friendly face do n't worry I 'm no threat not me . After that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , possibly three families of Bennett servants here . They did not make conversation . I had a palpable feeling of the politics of the place , the suspicious credential I had as a victim of the dogs . It was n't enough to crack their guild . They seemed confident of that . Well , screw them , they could n't even understand that I wanted no part of it . When I was strong enough , a day or two , I 'd be on my way down the railroad track and leave it to them to work out why . I still had the dollars I 'd come with , stained brown with my blood but no less negotiable . Nobody here , not even Libby , knew my full name or had asked where I came from or where I 'd been going . The force of self-distinguishing which I found so foolish among stiffs  | and hobos was what I ran on . When you are nobody and have nothing you depend on your troubles for self-respect . I had paid heavily for th bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a paying guest . I finished and walked out while they were still drinking their coffee . I ' be damned if I 'd lift a rake or anything else . What could they do , fire mf I stood on the porch and thought about leaving right away , immediatel ' And it was at this moment that I saw over the rise to the meadow tw people on the tennis court  --  one of them a girl with blond hair . I fixed my eyes on her and walked forward already confirmed in expect , tion by the agonized heave of my heart . Mr. Penfield the resident poet , an absurd roundish figure in whil shorts and a shirt stretched dangerously by an enormous belly , was shov ing from his side of the net the proper form of the forehand . Once twit three times he stroked the air . His lithe student , trim in a tennis dyes watched him while holding her racquet on her shoulder . Penfield now hit a ball to her . Careless of all his advice , she swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the fence across tlF meadow . I saw tennis balls lying like white flowers everywhere . He reached into a round basket for another ball and hit it gently , an again she took a furious swing and the ball flew over the fence . Once moi he hit to her and she spun herself around missing the ball entirely . H said something to her . She glared at him , dropped the racquet and le the court . She strode across the grass toward the main house . She tossed her visc away unpinned her hair fluffing it to the breeze ignoring him as he stoc on the court and called after her in a voice half reproach half apolog ' " Clara ! Clara ! " But she went over the crest of a slope and descended by degrees unt only her head could be seen moving toward the house . Mr. Penfiel hurriedly collected the tennis balls lying about the court . I did the sari thing in the grass . We met at the court gate . His large bleary face gaze upon mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , admitting me with a stunnin lack of ceremony to his thoughts . " All I said was ' Take a level swing , don  | worry about hitting hard . ' " He looked again in the direction she had gone . He smiled . " But what game can it be , after all , in which one does n't hit one 's hardest ! " He thrust into my hands the racquet and pail of balls and hurried off after her , moving lightly on the balls of his feet with that ability of some fat people to be quick and graceful . I stepped onto the court and picked up her racquet . I took everything to the shack not even thinking of it as the site of my grisly misfortune . I had forgotten misfortune . I headed back to the staff house , from one moment to the next , a worried probationary in my dark green shirt and pants no thought further from my mind than leaving . I wanted a job ! Their job ! Just as they knew I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool they had in mind oh God it was Clara , that was her name , Clara the girl on the train , no question about it , twice now the sight of her had stopped my heart .  | I did n't know what would happen in my life but I knew whatever it w. it would have to do with her , with Clara . I thought even having her nary was an enormous inroad of intelligence . Was she a Bennett ? But wouldn they know their games , were n't they trained to their tennis and the riding ? This one , so blazingly beautiful and pissed-off , knew nothing , th one standing pigeon-toed and swinging stiff-armed at balls so incredib breath-takingly awkward and untrained  --  no , she was not a relation . W ; she a guest ? If so , where were the others , she had come with a train , maic in waiting ! an entourage ! but they were nowhere about , only the resider poet Penfield ambled after her like her pet bear . Was she related 1 Penfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know about he Dressed in dark green , a spy ! I worked to show them how worthy I wa how useful , to show them how I admired what they were and how wanted to he like them and one of them . How much time did I have Only until the big man arrived , I had only that time to prove I shouldn he thrown out on my ass .  | Of course I could n't express to Libby even the most idly curious question about this princess living on the grounds . But she had loved showing me the guest book and I thought from her same peasant identification with Bennett wealth she would enjoy the wonder on my face as she secretly showed me the main house , where they lived and had their lives and Charlie Chaplin and the one-named kings sat down to dinner . The Bennetts not at home there was a bending of the rules : on Saturday night two Loon Lake station wagons pulled out leaving a skeleton staff . On Sunday afternoon with the sun coming through the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sun along dark corridors , Libby and I tiptoed about the vast upstairs with its hall alcoves of casement windows and window seats and bookshelves and its suites of rooms , each with its generous shade porch , and Adirondacks chairs and sofas . Whatever empty room I saw led my mind to the next room , the next turn in the corridor , everywhere the light off the lake cast its silvery shimmer on the walls or in my eyes as we passed open doorways . One wing was closed off . " We ca n't go there , " Libby said . " Why not ? " I asked , casual as I could be . " It 's the Bennetts ' wing , where they stay . " " Is someone there ? " " No . But I would n't feel right about it . Rose and Mary take care of it , " she said . She led me down a back stair through a kitchen with two black steel ranges and pantries of provisions and several iceboxes each crowned with its humming cylindrical motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of china and drawers of silver service . Through the hexagonal dining room , three walls of glass and a table hexagonal in shape to seat thirty people . To the huge living room , the grandest room of all , with tan leather couches built into the walls , the walls hung with the heads of trophy . There were two different levels of game tables and racks of magazines and clusters of stuffed chairs all looking out enormous windows to the lake . I found myself tiptoeing , with a sense of intrusion , my chest constricted ? and something else  --  the thinnest possibility of destructive intent ,  | some very fine denial on my part to submit to awe . " Of course this is jus one of their places , " Libby said . " Can you imagine ? " One or two steps up and we were in the entrance hall . The walls wer of dark rough wood . We stood under a chandelier made from antlers . gazed up a wide curved staircase of halved logs polished to a high shim with balusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnarled and swirlin , access to a kingdom of trolls . " Do n't you love roughing it ? " I said to Libby , running her up th staircase . " What ! " she cried , but laughing too , entirely subject to m mood . In the long upstairs corridor I placed her hand on my arm and strolled with her as if we were master and mistress . I led her into one a the suites and flinging open the glass doors of the porch , I extended m arm and said , " Let us enjoy the view that God in his wisdom has arrange for us , my deah . " She swept past me giggling in the game and we stoop in the sun side by side looking over the kingdom . " Do you mind if I smoke , old girl ? " I said in my best imitation o wealthy speech . " No ? Why , thank you , I think I 'll light up one of thes monogrammed cigs with my initials on them . " She was animated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kissed her to show her how the wealthy kissed , their noses so high ii the air that their lips never met , only their chins . Then of course I kisses her properly . She was confused , she drew back blushing , she had though it her secret that she was sweet on me . Whatever I wanted from poor Libby I could n't explain what I wa doing solely to gain it . We had the run of the house and pretended b be masters . For those few minutes the upstairs maid and the hobo bo : were the Bennetts of Loon Lake . Libby took my hand and showed me a storage room where F. W Bennett kept his stock of outfits that he provided his guests as gifts : riding habits and boots , tennis flannels , bathing suits , a goddamn haberdashery I stood in front of a full-length mirror and took off my greens and pu on a pair of tan tweed knickers with pleats , ribbed socks , brown-and-white saddle shoes , my size , a soft white shirt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown diamonds across my chest . I was stunned by the magnificent youth that looked hack at me fron  | the mirror . All the scars and deeper marks of hard life were covered in fine fashion . The face , a bit gaunt but unlined , the hair I combed back hastily with my fingers . He made a passing aristocrat ! Well , I thought , so a lot of the effect comes from the outside , does n't it ? I might be a Bennett son ! And then I felt again my child 's pretense that those two gray sticks in Paterson were not really my parents but my kidnappers ! Who knew whose child I was ! I dreamed of recognition from her from Clara . It was her nearness that made me so crazy , and bold with Libby . So feverish so happy . And as for Bennett I thought , He is no more aware of me than of some unfortunate prowler mauled by the wild dogs . But here I am , wearing his clothes , wandering freely through his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know it ! Then Libby came back from the female supply store and she was wearing jodhpurs and a silk blouse and a riding helmet perched none too securely on her thick hair and she wobbled in a pair of shiny boots too wide in the shank for her thin legs . " You look swell , Libby , " I said . She turned around with little shaky steps and gave me all the dimensions . Her gray eyes shone , her mouth stretched in her tremulous overbitten smile . I danced her out of there down the corridor doing a fast fox trot full of swirls while I hummed the tune I had heard the night I came , " Exactly Like You , " Libby laughing and worrying at the same time , telling me to hush , looking back over her shoulder , giggling , falling against me every other step , brushing my cheek with her lips . And the light lay like a track along the carpet and shone in golden stations of the open doors .  | There being no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying in the smaller lodge perhaps a hundred yards west , into the woods and halfway down the hill to the lake . I think I must have spent some while calculating how to get there figuring out a pretext and then a script for the conversation we would have . But one evening , during the staff meal , one of the woodfolk , a grandmotherly one , said to me , " That Penfield called . You 're to go over to the cottage . " " Who , me ? What for ? " " How should I know ? " she said . " I 'll be glad when you 're gone and them with you . " I finished my meal as slowly as I could , feigning the attitude of the workingmen of dark green . I washed my tray and lit a cigarette and sauntered back to my room . I latched the door and changed from my work clothes to the knickers and shirt and sweater and ribbed socks and saddle shoes . Poor Libby , all happiness drained like the color in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things . Should n't she have known that the fellow who 'd write in the guest book would do that ? Anyway , she understood the firm basis of our relationship , that whatever trust she placed in me I would betray . And as for Mr. Penfield I knew in my bones I did n't have anything to fear from him . He had a way of canceling himself out if you let him talk long enough . I washed my face and combed my hair and got out of the staff house without being seen . Already dark on the path , the first stars coming out . Joe drew a sharp breath and tried to calm himself . He was trembling . He had followed her , navigating by her star , and by that means had been sleeping in a bed and eating well and indulging his self-regard for several weeks . An edited view but fervently held . In his mind , his feelings were enough . He did n't need intentions , plans , the specificity of hope . Presenting his heart was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Penfield said at the door . He held a bottle of red wine in one hand and a glass in the other . " Come in , come in ! " It was a low-ceilinged cottage with a living room and kitchen and stone hearth all in one . I tried not to look at her she was sitting on the sofa Indian style wearing a robe of white satiny material and it had fallen open across her thighs . I tried not to look she was not looking at me but taking a mighty pull from her wineglass head up neck beautiful pulsing neck . " Here he is , Clara  --  Joe of Paterson , the man I wanted you to meet . " A glass was put in my hand . " Miss Clara Lukafs , " he said . Pointing me at a chair , he crossed his ankles and sank his bulk down on the floor at her feet . They were both facing me and to my right and their left a fire was going in the fireplace . The light flared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , especially from her she had not asked to meet me how absurd to have thought that . I sensed some purpose not entirely complimentary in the summons . Yet Penfield was smiling amiably indicating to inc to drink and so I did , with the odd conviction that I had  | never tasted wine before . I had ridden the cars with the bums of thre ( states worked with freaks and was wicked and shameless but in thi ; moment it was my inexperience that shone . What was the conversation ? Mostly his , of course , the brilliant singson ? of the failed poet , but how could I have been listening with the attentior such beautiful words demanded , people from my world did n't talk witl such embellishment such scrollwork . I had never before met someone wh ( admitted to the profession of poet but believed it by the way he spoke I kept my eyes on his face but it was her I looked at , this restless cat of inattention sitting quite still and staring into her wine careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream cracked hummoci of the underknees she sat quite still but her mind pacing from one wal to another , an expression on her small fair face of grief or petulance 1 could n't tell . But how she felt was of overriding importance to me , how she felt ! ? then and every moment after  --  was my foremost concern , what I lived by . This was her quality and I think she was unconscious of it , that her presence occupied great moral space around her though she was surprisingly small , a small-boned slight thing with narrow shoulders . There was nothing stately about her except the alarming size of her moods . I studied her face with a fervent rush of recognition , a fair skin with a rouge of chapped cheeks , quick green eyes prominent upper lip everything framed in marcelled bleached blond hair I had friends playing as a child with such faces in Paterson I heard the fluent yowl of injustice from this face . Mr. Penfield speaking of injustice explained how much more modest were his own rooms over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand he wrote well there he said in his way of negating his every point of view by obliging himself to express its opposite . Then he recites some lines about the place , about Loon Lake . The glass in one hand , the bottle in the other , he sits with legs outstretched he is in his dirty sneakers with no socks his tweed jacket with the elbow patches his tennis shirt with the soft collar turned under on one side , he produces a deep melodious voice for his lines not his normal voice I was embarrassed by this sudden access to performance but she was not . She paid attention  | to his poetry as she had not to his conversation . But no audience was as responsive to Mr. Penfield 's words as he was . His red eyes grew large with a film of tears . I augment my memory with the lines actually printed in a private edition , the last of his three privately published volumes all recording different times of his life in the different places the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hear today " ? in his deep reader 's chant ? " cries to distract the dying loons diving into the cold black lake and diving back out again in a whorl of clinging water clinging like importuning spirits fingers shattering in spray feeling up the wing along the rounded body of the thrillingly exerting loon beaking a fish rising to the moon streamlined its loon eyes round and red . " And I , resonantly attuned to her , alive to the firelit moment  --  somewhere I had gotten at great cost , with the scars to show it , from such profound effort , the kind of unceasing insistence on my life 's rights that was only now so exhausting in my release from it . As this absurd fat drunkard sang his words they seemed the most beautiful I had ever heard . But perhaps any words would have done . I heard them and I did n't hear them , I had no idea he had just written them I thought they were from some book already done , I heard the feeling they inspired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the way it should be , I was feeling Penfield 's immense careless generosity , the boon of himself which granted me without argument everything I was struggling for , all of it assumed in the simple giving of words , so moving to this scruffy boy . It was the moment of dangerous specification of everything I thought worth wanting . After the loon flew off whose red eyes were much like his own he cleared his throat and he poured wine all around although I 'd barely sipped mine . He emptied the bottle on his turn and struggled to his feet for another bottle which he uncorked while continuing to speak and again he sat down with the new bottle as attached to his hand as the old . I tried not to look at her . I saw the glance from under her brows toward the ceiling , the impatience , and then I began to feel the force of the occasion which was that somehow I was enlisted to help divert , distract  | or pacify Clara Lukafs . That was the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some overburdened instant , with our bac to it , grounding our heels , digging in . And then he was telling us about the war , of all things , a veteran , migc would he bring out the poppies ? But soon we were inside his imag , listening like children , the mule-drawn caissons sinking in the mud , t troops in greatcoats and tin helmets riding the mules ' backs , kicking the boots sharply against the mules ' flanks , the bracing of backs on six-fc wheels , spokes like baseball bats tires of steel , each soldier alone a miserable inside his coat , charred trees beside the road the sky showi through city hall , gusts of acrid air blowing from the front , and here Corporal Penfield riding the signal wagon , flag tubes strapped to his ba like quivers , a helmet tilting over his eyes because the strap is too loo : and on his lap the crate covered with a khaki blanket shifts perceptib the pigeons whirring with each dull boom lighting the sky like lightni. miles ahead . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket . He hand it to me . The colors of the ribbon had bled , there was thread and li attached to it , but it was a Silver Star and it was his . I leaned forward put it in her hand leaning forward over the bear r between us , our hands grazed I felt the heat of her hand . And there in our minds as we looked at the palpable proof was Sigr Corporal Penfield during the battle of the Somme dispatched urgently semaphore the artillery to drop some heavy stuff on the encircling Hui " The field telephone did n't work , there was n't even a damn pigei left . " He paused to wet his throat . " So I took the old semaphore flags a went up to the top of a hill where I could be seen , because even thou it was night the star shells were like the Fourth of July and it was bright than day . I could see out over no man 's land . I sent my message " ? he he lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-heart pantomime ? " and a while later the artillery came in on target , and tha what I got the medal for . " " You 're a hero , " she said , smiling . She dropped the medal in his l and then raised her glass to her lips . " No , but , love , you have n't heard the end . " Ile dropped his chin to 1  | chest . " I was so terrified I did n't send the message I was supposed to . What I semaphored was the first verse of a poem . " " What ? " I said . " There was a time when meadow , grove , and stream , The earth , and every common sight , To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light , The glory and the freshness of a dream , ' and so on , " he said . " And a while later the shells came in on target . It was very strange . " She was laughing . " In the war  --  in the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The Intimations Ode ? Did n't you have it in school ? " " But why ? " " I do n't know why . Maybe I thought I was going to die . Maybe it seemed to me the only appropriate thing to say . Anyway , after I got the medal I wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Army returning it and telling him it was more properly William Wordsworth 's . " " But it was n't a medal for poetry , " I said , and immediately felt like a fool . " Apparently not , Joe of Paterson . Apparently not . I had to go for psychiatric tests . They pinned the medal on my bathrobe . They kept me under observation for ninety days in Nutley , New Jersey . " " Where ? " she said , happily laughing . He looked up at her , victorious in her amusement . " Oh , Warren , you old fuck , where ? " She threw back her head and laughed and laughed , I gazed at her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could look at all of her as she sat in her white satin robe , she bending forward now in her laughter , the robe unfolding like unfolding wings so that I could see her breasts . Then I realized Penfield was looking at me , with his head lowered , with raised eyebrows , a characteristic expression , I knew at once , full of sadness , full of self-acknowledgment , and as she reached out and touched his head he too began to giggle , he was in love with her , and soon they were both laughing and I was laughing , but trying not to for some reason , feeling badly that I laughed , feeling ashamed . I had n't realized how drunk they were . A few moments later , in silence , she put her glass down and reached out , holding his head in her arms . Ile looked tip at her , and behind her shingle of hair he kissed her , his hand  | with the bottle going up involuntarily , another semaphore , and I hey her sob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave , but they would n't allow it . All at once they were vi physical with me , placing themselves on either side of me and leading i back to the middle of the room . Penfield went to stoke up the fire . S led me to my chair and pressed my shoulders firmly with her small har and then sat across from me and studied me solemnly . Until this mom ( her primary awareness had been of Penfield , she had not quite ackno ' edged me , as if one person at a time , and only one , could occupy her mil She was always to be this way , intense and direct with whatever she fix upon , and whatever the affront to those on the periphery . It was r snobbishness or anything like that  --  she was in fact reckless of her s ( interest in a situation , and that I think was the center of her force a effect . She knew nothing about courtesy in the sense of not being subjc to it . She blazed through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked that she was no older than I was . I v stunned  --  I was not yet twenty  --  I equated power and position in t world with age . " You live here ? " she said . " How do you stand it ? " I rubbed my pal . on my knickers . I looked with alarm at Warren Penfield , who said , " Cla he 's my surprise for you , " and came back to his place on the floor . She had a throaty voice with a scratched quality . Her diction was of t street . " Whats ' at mean ! " She gazed at me , her eyes widening , and I v certain , as if a chasm were opening around me , that she was as frauduk in this place as I was . I drank off my wine . " You remember the night you heard the dogs ? " the poet said to h and leaned forward to refill my glass . " Joe here is taking each day as comes  --  like you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went to the fire and sat down bef ( it with her back to us . I do n't remember much of what happened af. that . I drank more than I should have . The fire looming her shadow acn the low-ceilinged room . Later we heard the rain falling , a heavy rain tl seemed to ( 10 something to time draught . W(x)d smoke came into the roc  | on gusts . At this point we were all standing , I had removed my shirt , and she was tracing the scars on my chest and arms and neck with her fingertips . I could smell her , the soap she used , the gel of her hair . The firelight flared on our faces as if we were standing with the poet in his war . " He told me it was a deer , that they took a deer , " she said . " That was a lie . " " Yes , " Penfield said , watching her fingers . " What class , " Clara said . Tears were suddenly coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Penfield said . His eyes closed and he began moving his head from side to side like someone in mourning . " I can get you out of here . We can leave together . " His sentences became a hum , a soft keening , as if he were listening to some private elegy and had no hope of an answer from her . " That son of a bitch , " she said with the tears streaming . " I would n't give him the satisfaction .

The wide doors swung open admitting a great flood of light , the horses were led out , and I caught a glimpse of her in jodhpurs , velvet riding jacket , she was fixing the strap of her riding helmet .

Each of his representations of himself at the critical moments of this past contributed to the finished man before me . He proved everything by his self-deprecation , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , and he proved it in the scene or two with Clara , when , at an hour he somehow always knew , he would get me to help him over to her cottage not five minutes since she had come in herself , her make-up and hair and dress all showing the use of the evening , and she in some sort of sodden rage . What excited Mr. Penfield was the idea of rescue . He wanted to save her , take her away , carry her off . It was the pulsating center of his passion . And she seemed now not to understand , as if they spoke different languages , hers being Realism . " War-rin , " she would say , " do I have to spell it out ?

"  | Another night or the one after , I went over to her cottage alon supposed it was midnight . No light on . It did n't matter . I sat in shadow of her porch and I folded my arms and waited . A strong w blowing over the mountains and sounding in the trees around the cotta The trunks of the pine trees swayed and creaked . I sat with my bacl the door and drew up my knees . I might be hearing her in her rut , sing somewhere with the wind going past an open window . That was all ri ? That was all right . If the poet could have her on her terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on mine . My revelation . Maybe she trave like a princess on a private train , maybe poets thought they recogni her , but I knew her accent , she was an Eastern industrial child , she come off streets like my streets she was born of the infinite clas nameless workers my very own exclusive class . Jesus , I had pressed aga girls like her in the hallways , I had bent them backward on the banis I had pulled their hair I had lifted their skirts I had rubbed them till t creamed through their underpants . I reached over my head and tried the doorknob . Open . I decided to  | for her in comfort . I turned on a light . The wood smoke lay under the low ceiling . The hearth was cold . I put in some paper and kindling and got a fire going and stood with my back to the fire . The green livery had as little regard for her as they did for Penfield . The place was a mess . I saw traces of our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that she 'd care . I looked in her bedroom . Her clothes everywhere , stockings twisted and curled like strips of bacon , step-ins in two perfect circles on the floor as if disengaged in a meditative moment , or flung across a lampshade as if drop-kicked . Poor Mr. Penfield . I knew what he could n't possibly know . I knew what made his sympathies obsolete . Clara and Bennett had had breakfast together on the morning after he arrived . I managed to be raking leaves at the foot of the terrace wall under their line of sight . It was a bright windy morning and the clouds actually were below us over the lake and drifting through the trees on the mountains . " I think clouds should stay in the sky where they belong , " Clara said , " do n't you ? " And Bennett had laughed . Clara held a relentless view of the world . There were no visible principles . Every one of her moods and feelings was intense and true to itself ? if not to the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the times of the day . I smoked a cigarette from the monogrammed cigarette box . Clearly , in my aspiration it was FWB I would have to contend with . FWB , the man who was paying for everything . Conceivably this gave him an advantage . I mashed out the cigarette , stretched out on my back before the fire , put my hands under my head and closed my eyes . I slept in that position for several hours . I remember coming awake with the fire out and sunlight glowing on the windows . The silhouettes of branches and leaves wavered on the log wall and a reddish gold light filled the room . I heard the sound of an airplane . It grew louder and then with a rise in pitch it receded and grew faint . I lay there and it got louder again and finally so close and thunderous that the cups rattled in the sink . Then the sound receded once more , the pitch of the engine rising . I went to the window : a single-engine plane with pontoons was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake . I watched it , a seaplane with a  | cowled engine and an overhead wing . As it banked , its dimensions flar and I saw a smartly painted green-and-white craft zooming over the wal and then lifting its nose and banking off again , the sun flashing on wings . It was very beautiful to see . Again it was coming around . I r outside . I watched several runs , each one was different in speed or and of descent , it looked as if the pilot was practicing or doing tests . You did often see airplanes this close . And then as the show continued here was Clara Lukafs coming throu , the woods from the main house . She wore a white evening gown . S carried her shoes in her hand . She peered up through the trees , she turn ( she walked backward , she stopped , she stood on her toes . She mov through patches of light and shade , and reaching the little clearing front of the cabin , she took me in with a glance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very low this time . It drifted down the length of the lake a ' then dropped below the tree line . " Are you here ? " Clara said . She passed into the house and I follow ( She stood in the middle of the room with her hands on her hips , a ' realizing she still held her shoes , she flung them away . At this mom ( the phone rang . It was in the bedroom and she ran in as if she was goi to attack it . " What ! " I heard her shout by way of greeting . A pause . " Yeah , w ( I would n't count on it ! " she said and slammed the phone down . I waited a minute . When she did n't come out , I moved to the doorw She was sitting on the edge of her bed in some distraction slipping off o shoulder strap , then the other , shrugging her gown to her waist . Losi all volition , she dropped her hands in her lap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was matted and tears streamed do ' her cheeks . She had no degrees of response , she lived hard , and the effect of l crying on my heart was calamitous . Her eyes were swollen almost imme ately , her breasts were wet with her tears . Her looks collapsed as if tlwere a pretense . " Hey , " I said . " Come on . Come on . " After a while she st(x)d up and let the gown fall to her ankles . She h  | nothing on underneath . She was big-breasted for such a thin narrowshouldered girl . She stepped out of the gown and went into the bathroom and a moment later I heard the shower running . Her behind was small and firm , if a bit on the flat side . The prominence of her backbone made me smile . It made me think of the scrawny backs on sunburned little girls who came to the carnival in their bathing suits and convened at the cotton candy . While she showered I found a percolator and put up some coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big maroon FWB monogrammed on the front . She accepted a mug of coffee and sat on the couch with her legs folded under her and held the mug with both hands as if for warmth . She had washed her hair , which lay about her head in wet curls , she was no longer crying but the exercise had left her eyes glistening and as she looked at me I wondered how I could have found anything to criticize . I had never in my life seen a woman more beautiful . " This place is getting on my nerves , " she said . " How do I get out of here ? " " I 'll take care of it , leave it to me , " I said without a moment 's hesitation . Without a moment 's hesitation . She glanced at me as she sipped her coffee . I waited for my justice . I wondered if I had taken her too literally if she would laugh now crack my heart with her laughter . But she said nothing and seemed satisfied enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her cup on the floor and curled up on the sofa with her back to me . Drops of water glittered in her hair . After a while I realized she had gone to sleep . I ran out of there determined not to be amazed . I should concentrate on what I was going to do next . Amazement would set me back . I wanted to sing , I was exhilarated to madness . But the way to bring this off was to think of my brazen hopes as reasonable and myself as a calm practical person matter-of-factly making a life for himself that was no more than he deserved .  | Then Bennett himself was suddenly in full force in my life like a storm that had arrived . I found myself that same morning with three or four of the groundkeepers , each of us with a pick or shovel on our shoulders , we were hurrying to a site in the woods off the main bridle path . Bennett was waiting . He was standing on a hill of some sort . His horse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here , " he called . We climbed up the face of an enormous boulder imbedded in the ground . " I 've always wondered about this , " he said . " I want it exposed . ' The foreman of us , an older man long in the Bennett service , took ofl his cap and scratched his head . " You want us to dig this rock up ? " he asked . " Dig around it , " Bennett said . " You see here ? This is the top of it we 're standing on top of it . That 's what this rise is . I want the whole thing uncovered , I do n't know why it 's here . " The workmen had trouble believing what he wanted . Bennett did n't get mad . Instead , he took one of the picks and started going at it himself  | " You see ? " he called out , breathing hard between swings of the pick . " Work it away , like this . You see that , how it extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , Mr. Bennett , " the foreman said . " Do n't you be doing that . You , you , " he said to us . " Get to work . " So we started digging out a boulder that might be the size of a dirigible . Bennett watched each of us to see that we understood . " That 's the way , " he said . " That 's what I want . " He was sturdy and vigorous . Moved around a lot . A short wide-shouldered man with a large head . His hair was white but very full and combed as I combed mine , to a pompadour . He was well tanned . Blue eyes . A handsome blunt-faced old bastard in a riding outfit . I had expected someone older , more restrained . He climbed down off the rise and for several minutes crashed around in the woods nearby to see if he could find another rock like it . " You see , " he shouted , " it 's the only one . " Damnedest thing ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some archaeological expedition . Then he mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of the stables . As soon as he was out of sight the foreman leaned on his shovel , took off his cap and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand . " Jesus Mary and Joseph , " he said . We all sat down on the boulder . But a while later two more diggers came along flushed from their dens , and soon there were a half-dozen of us standing shirtless in the woods swinging our picks and shovels at this mountainous stone . It was interesting to me how the impulse of the man transformed into the hard work of the rest of us . By our digging we suggested something really important was going on , someone passing by would look at us and think it was serious  --  we ourselves were proof of the seriousness of the thing . I had expected not to like F. W. Bennett . But he was insane . How could I resist that ? There was this manic energy of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That was what free men were like , they shone their freedom over everyone . I did n't want to think what he did with Clara I could not dream that  | she could matter to him in any way at all that I would recognize . I swun ; my pick . All the intelligence I had of him , from his house and his land and his train and his resident poets , had not prepared me for the impel sonal force of him , the frightening freedom of him . In the late afternoon we knocked off work , having unearthed the boulder to its southern polar slope . It sat now in an enormous trench a the bottom of which were packed several other stones . It looked as if i weighed several tons . On the way back we stopped in front of the mail house to report these findings . Bennett stood on his front porch . He wa very pleased . " We 'll take it as far down as it goes , boys , " he said . " An ( tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it has markings . " Apparently as he gazed at these dirty and sweat-stained workmen hi saw in the face of one something that might have been disbelief . " You , Joe , " he said to me , " you think it 's just a rock , do n't you ? " I was so stunned that he knew my name I did n't know what to say " Come inside . I want you to see something . " He turned and went it the house . Someone reached over and took the pick from my shoulder . I heard ; snicker . I followed F. W. Bennett into his front hall and went past the stairway of halved logs to the sunken living room . There was a shimmering light on the ceiling , a reflection of the lake But the floor was in shadow . In one corner , on a table , was a book wit line drawings of primitive stone monuments : in all cases one large boulde rested on three or four smaller ones . " You see ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They put down then megaliths , or dolmens , for their fallen chiefs . " He strode around the room lecturing me on the burial practices o ancient Indian tribes of New England . He compared them to the ancien burial practices of the Western desert tribes . Indoors he seemed older . H was vigorous and moved constantly but his voice was somewhat hoarsf it suggested age . I stood in my filthy dark greens wondering how I was going to get ou of there . A maid came in holding a phone on a long cord . She brought it to hi side and held it for him on her palm while he picked lip the receives  | " Yes ? " He continued to move about , and the maid in her light green uniform followed him dutifully where he went , dealing with the cord so that it would n't snag on the furniture . He was getting information . He asked short questions  --  How many ? What time ? ? and listened to lengthy answers . I looked out the bay wall of windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark blue water . On the terrace a woman was arranging flowers in a vase . I realized I was looking at Lucinda Bailey Bennett , the aviatrix . The small shock of seeing someone famous . " You do n't know how to work cameras , by any chance ? " The phone was gone . Bennett was talking to me . " I 've got all this equipment here but I ca n't get the hang of it myself , " he said . " I want to take proper pictures of the excavation and send them out to see if I 'm right . " " I do n't know anything about cameras , " I said . " I thought you were smart . . . Well , " he said , " I wanted to take a look at you , anyway , to see if you belong with me on a permanent basis . What 's your opinion ? " " You mean a job ? " I said . " That 's what I mean . You think you ought to be hired ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No ? " He seemed amused . " I could n't live here , " I said . " It 's not for me . " He laughed out loud . " You seemed to have adapted well enough . From what I understand you 've made the place your own . " Something outside had caught his eye . He stepped onto the terrace , closing the glass doors behind him , and stood calling down the hill to somebody at the boathouse . My muscles were tight and my hands clenched . I tried to loosen up . Mrs. Bennett glanced through the window to where I was and said something to her husband . He turned to her smiling and said something back and she looked again in at me briefly , a half smile on her face . She was a very elegant , honest-looking lady , very well composed , with brown hair cut short , no make-up or anything like that , she wore a loose sweater and a longish skirt and low-heeled shoes . I thought you would not be able  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this slim handsome woman with he flowers knew how to fly the hell out of airplanes . And then it came to me he was telling her who the boy inside was . The one and only Joe of Paterson . She was so elegant I realized that what 1 had written in anger and pride was from another point of view pathetic I felt betrayed , like a child who gives out his most precious secret ant hears it laughed about . I turned to leave . I thought how powerful this Bennett was if I could be made to feel so bad from just a moment or two of his attention . " Just a minute , Joe , " he called . " I 'm not finished with you . " He went past me into the front hall and then down the corridor of the other wing of the house . He opened a door and beckoned to me . A large room filled with books , cabinets with silver cups , photograph : of Mrs. Bennett standing in front of airplanes , Mr. Bennett in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam locomotive , photographs of cars and horses and presidents and governors and film stars There were globes on stands and big dictionaries on lecterns , a ticker-tape machine under glass  --  a whole life of glory was in this room . Bennett sat down behind his desk and took a manila folder out of drawer and studied the papers in it for several minutes while I stood before him . Without looking up , he said , " Are your injuries healed ? " " I suppose . " " Have you been in touch with your parents ? " " My parents ? " " They signed a waiver , " he said , removing a document from the folder " You mean you have n't talked to them ? I am not at fault for the injuries you incurred on my property . They received two hundred and fifty dol lars . " How do you know my parents ? " " We looked through your billfold . You might have been on your wa ) out . " I was too stunned to speak . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting along ? " He shoved a paper along the desk and I saw at the hottoni the shaky signatur (  | of my father . " I 'm not lying to you , " Bennett said . " By rights that 's your money . I shook my head . " You do n't want to work for me . Fine . You can go home and if you 're smart you can use that money to make money . Buy something and sell it for profit . Anything , it does n't matter . Some of the great fortunes in this country were built from less . " I pictured my father in the kitchen , coming to terms with this legal paper that had to be signed . Finding my school pen somewhere in a drawer and the bottle with Waterman 's ink . Testing the penpoint on the oilcloth that covered the table and then rubbing the ink off with his thumb before it dried . My mother standing at the sink , washing the dishes , disguising the moment of the waiver in their lives as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's theirs . " " I 'll tell you , " Bennett said . " I always respect a man 's decision . Never try to argue him out of it . You 're not staying here and you 're not going home . That leaves you back on the road , does n't it ? Back on the bum . Well , I say why not , if that 's what you want . But be sure you can handle it . Just be sure you 've got the guts . So that if you have to steal or take a sap to someone 's head for a meal , you 'll be able to . Every kind of life has its demands , its tests . Can I do this ? Can I live with the consequences of what I 'm doing ? If you ca n't answer yes , you 're in a life that 's too much for you . Then you drop down a notch .

" like old Penfield , find your level . Get in , get into the place that 's your nature , whether it 's running a corporation or picking daisies in a field , get in there and live to it , live to the fullness of it , become what you are , and I 'll say to you , you 've done more than most men .

Go along . Do what everyone 's doing . Let it leach away . Sign i away . Drink it away . Sleep it away .

He was the only one who could help me with Clara 's escape . That was his word , escape . Clara would leave because she was dislodged by the returning wife , Clara would leave because with unforgivable haste she 'd been removed from the cozy confidences of Loon Lake 's master bedroom . But it would n't do to tell him that . He thought he was in torment for her sake . He brooded about rescuing her . That 's the way poets are , I said to myself . They see what no one else can see , and what is clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed . His breath rasped . His skin was a strange pink-gray color and it shone in a glaze of perspiration . He stared at me mournfully from his pillows , his blue and bloodshot eyes swimming in helplessness . Oh God . That was all I needed . I went out and found Libby in the staff house . " I 'll have nothing to do with you , " she said . " It 's not me , Libby . It 's Mr. Penfield . Soinetliing 's wrong with him . I think he needs a doctor . "  | She looked at me with suspicion . She went ahead of me to the stables and ran up the stairs to keep as much distance between us as she could . She took one look at the poet and without troubling to remove herself from his hearing said , " There 's nothing wrong with him , he just likes to carry on . " What do you know , Libby ? " he cried out , stung . " I know what a hollow leg is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's enough to make anyone sick . " " Get out , get out ! " Penfield shouted . " Will everyone torture me ?

" Do n't touch a thing , damnit , you 're disrupting everything ! " She straightened his bedcovers and plumped up his pillows while he shouted at her to leave him alone . Furious with both of us , she marched out . " Joe , there 's a bottle of wine under the window seat , " Mr. Penfield said . I wondered what was wrong with me to be so gullible to the claims of this man . He lived here at Loon Lake sloshing in self-pity , the best aspect of him , his gift for poetry , put to the use of unsound notions . Obviously this was the solution of his life . I could n't change that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle and a glass . He sat up . " Mr. Penfield , I 've got to tell you something , " I said , pulling a chair to his bedside . " But I need some information first . Who is Clara ? Who were those people who came with her on the train ? " " Tommy Crapo , " he said . " Who ? " " Tommy Crapo . The industrial consultant . " He drank off a half-glass of wine . " Do n't you read the newspapers ? Do n't you look at the tabloids ? Tommy Crapo who has his picture taken on night-club banquettes with beautiful women . " Color was coining hack to his face . Ile emptied the glass and lay back on his pillows .  | " Is he in the rackets ? " " Mr. Crapo is a specialist in labor relations . Yes .

A moment passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get Miss Lukaes away from here , do n't you ? " " Well , she 's ready . " " What ? " He was not used to being taken at his word . He was not equipped for action . " Miss Lukafs is ready to get out of here , " I said . " What ? " " She 's ready to make her escape . " I have committed many sins in my life . This precise sin  --  the sin against poets  --  is without absolution . He was out of bed and struggling into a worn maroon robe that had a few tassels left on the belt . I could hear each breath he took . He got on his knees to look under the bed for his slippers . He found them , stood , stepped into them , and then went slapping across the floor , back and forth from one corner of his apartment to another without purpose or intent but busy with agitation . I sat him down in his reading chair and brought him a cigarette and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger , his hand shaking . " What did she say ? " he asked . " She wants me to get her away .

" " He 's on his way , Mr. Penfield . " " I see . I see . " " Miss Lukas says once she 's safe she can get in touch with you . " " She said that ?

I want this for her . It 's just . I put my faith in you , Joe . Yes , take her away from here . Two young people ! It 's right . Yes , it 's the only way .

He clapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this moment he would rather have died than reveal his anguish . As I was leaving he stood at the door and pulled back the sleeve of his robe .

I rolled up my sleeve and showed my arm . " That 's right , " he said . " You know what two men do who share the sign of the wild dog ? " He touched his forearm to mine so that they crossed .

A boy enjoys ice cream from a wooden spoon in the sun before the war in front of the candy store on the corner while he waits for the light to change . At this moment several things happen . A horse pulling the wagon of a peddler of vegetables trots by smartly golden balls of dung dropping from the base of its arched tail . Then there was a whirring in my ears and over the top of Paterson Grade School Three a monumental dirigible nosed into view looming so low I could see the seams of its paneled silver skin and human shadows on the windows of its gondola . It was not sailing straight through its bow but shouldering the wind shuddering dipping and rising in its sea of air . It soared over the roof of a tenement and disappeared . At the same time the traffic light turned green and I crossed from sun to shade noting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change of temperature . In front of the shoe repair on Mechanic Street at the sidewalk 's edge between a Nash and Hudson parked at the curb a baby girl was suspended from her mother 's hands her pants pulled down .

" someone called behind me . I raised my hand to shop I knew what I was doing and that I 'd be right back . This was the trail the riders took to get to another shore of the lake a mile down from the main house . It was hoed regularly to keep it sof ? I had done some of that myself . It went through stands of towering pin ( and over small clearings where the grass was turning tan and gold in th ( autumn , and then it dropped down into an area where the leaves wen falling like snowflakes . I felt the same turning season in me . Where the trail cornered , along the shore of the wide lake , was ar airplane hangar with a concrete ramp . Mr. Penfield sat on the ramp witl his arms around his knees . He was looking at the water . The wind ha ( whipped up a small white chop . Wavelets slapped at the concrete . H ( did n't seem to notice Lucinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She pulled a big red trainman 's handkerchiel from the pocket of her overalls and wiped her hands . I ducked around through the underbrush and came within a few feel of them . I could see inside : an engine was suspended from pulleys . A mar was guiding it to a workbench . " What do you do , Lucinda , " said Mr. Penfield in a petulant tone " Paint the innards like a new toy ? " " No , old bear . When I 'm through , its innards will be dark and oiled and refitted to tolerances that will take me to the top of the sky . " Sh ( stuffed her handkerchief into the pouch of her overalls . " Why are yor sulking ? I thought you loved inc. "  | " Since I gave up manhood to live here , I make no claims of that sort on anyone . She smiled . " That 's not the report I have .

" " How much better for me if when I came here my throat had been ripped out . " She sighed . " Yes , " she said , " I suppose so . " After a moment she turned back and he lifted himself grunting to his feet . He lumbered after her . " Forgive me , " he called . " Oh , Warren , it 's such a bore when you whine . " She went into the hangar . " Yes , " he cried out bitterly . " Indeed . My agony does not divert . " And he followed her . I could n't hear them now . The hangar was lit by electric lights that glimmered very faintly through the brightness of the morning . But I saw them moving around , she working and he talking with grand gestures . Every once in a while I heard the sound of his voice , and I knew Mr. Penfield well enough to know he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , because he was talking for me . The man who 'd been helping came out , lit a cigarette and went off along the trail . I moved to the hangar itself , staying out of sight of the doorway . I leaned my back to the wall . " You have a good nature , " I heard Mrs. Bennett say . " Oh my dear ! " " Would you like to go on a flight ? Probably not . But a really long flight . Just the two of us . Would you consider it ? " " What ? Where ? " " I do n't know . The Far East . Shall we do that ? Fly across the Pacific . " " The Far East ? " " Yes , pooh bear . A long flight . You and I. Oh , that 's a good idea !

" " Lucinda , what ? flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , foolish thing  --  I do n't mean that ! Good God ! " She was merry now . " It 's a practice made too thoroughly disreputable by its devotees , do n't you think ? " That evening the four of them met for dinner . I stood on the terrace just out of the light cast through the windows and I watched them at their drinks . A fire blazed in the huge fireplace . Mounted prey gazed down at them . Clara was wearing a gown of sequined silver . She looked cheap . She sat staring at the floor , cowed , maybe even stunned into silence , by the nuances of civilization in that room . The gentlemen wore black tie , in which Mr. Penfield managed to look as rumpled and ill-prepared for life as ever . With his characteristic expression of appeal for love and understanding he glanced habitually at the others , but especially Clara . Lucinda Bennett smiled faintly and kept up her end of the conversation . Only F. W. Bennett seemed to be enjoying himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to a table behind the leather sofa and held up a large flat book opened , and resting on his arm , and he read from it and laughed and looked at the others for their reaction . I went through the woods to Clara 's cabin and found her luggage standing just inside the front door . There were three bags and a hatbox . I got all of them under my arms or hanging from my hands , and struggled up the hill to the garage on the far side of the tennis court . This was the old Loon Lake stable . It housed five cars . In the last stall was Mrs. Bennett 's car , a rarely used gray two-door Mercedes-Benz with a canvas top and spare tires in the front fender wells . I looked for the ignition key where Mr. Penfield had told me to  --  in the bud vase on the right-hand side in the back . Yes . I packed the bags in the trunk , which was not large , and put the hatbox in the back seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow learned the European-style shifting . There were four gears , and a diagram of their positions was imprinted on the mother-of-pearl knob of the floor shift . The dust on the seat cracked under me . I flicked at it with a chamois cloth . The odometer showed less than ten thousand miles . Then I saw it was not even miles , it was kilometers . Lucinda Bennett had told Mr. Penfield it was a 1933 model . Clearly ,  | her interest in machines did not include cars . The license plate was up to date , however . I swung open the doors as quietly as I could and got in and started the engine . I backed out . It was a noisy car  --  I later found it was only forty horsepower  --  and I drove it the few yards to the gas pump shushing it as if it were a baby . I filled it with Mr. Bennett 's personal ethyl and then I gay e each tire a shot of his air . I was wearing his knickers and argyle sweater and brown-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was ready to go . I waited behind the wheel . It was a snug little car . The seats were gray leather . The doors opened front to back . I went over some road maps . I sat there and got the feeling of the car and worried about driving it well , and wondered where to go and what I would say to Clara Lukafs and what she would say to me . I worried that people seeing me behind the wheel would think I was rich . I did n't once reflect on the lately peculiar conforming of life to my desires . I did n't think of Lucinda Bennett 's generosity or despair , or Mr. Penfield 's , nor even reach the most obvious conclusion ; that I was leaving Loon Lake in somewhat better condition than I had come . Calculating , heedless , and without gratitude , I accepted every circumstance that had put me there , only gunning my mind to the future , wanting more , expecting more , too intent on what was ahead to sit back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I peered through the windshield . I watched the trees shaking in the night wind . I unlatched the canvas top and pushed it back a bit and looked at the stars , which seemed to shimmer and blur as if the wind were blowing through them . Eventually she got there , hurrying along with Mr. Penfield holding her arm , while she held her gown off the ground to keep from tripping . She wore a fur jacket over the gown . He opened the door , but before she could slide in , he grabbed her and hugged her and started to gabble something . I saw all this with their heads cut off . I saw her push him away . " War-rin , please ! " she said . Then she was in the car beside me , in an atmosphere of fur and cold air , and she slammed the door . Penfield peered in , then ran around the front of the car to the driver 's side . I started the engine and threw the toggle switch for the headlights . I adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thrust something in my hand , a wad of bills . " I wish i was more , " he said . He gave us advice of many kinds , cheerful assurances warnings about the road , the weather , appeals to keep in touch , phon numbers on bits of paper , promises , vows , thrown kisses  --  and to this fitfu love song I put the car into first , and off we lurched down the road . We were taking what was called the back road , away from the mail house ; there was a sudden bend , and Mr. Penfield , waving in the nigh in his black tie , veered out of my rear view . I leaned forward , attentive to the clutching , and gradually , as we made our way bumping and sliding over this gravelly unpaved circuit through the Bennett preserve , I got the hang of it . We drove for quite a while I glanced at her . In the glow of the dashboard I saw her young face . I think now of that long drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nowhere to gallop yelping alongside , their breatl sounding metallic , like the engine ; and disappearing just as suddenly , the ' again one or two of them , then for a mile a beating pack ; and she sayinj nothing , only holding the leather strap by her window , looking out to the side , to the front , her eyes following them tracking them , the youth o her illuminated in the low light . Finally we outdistanced them all . She sat back in her seat . She took a cigarette out of her purse an ( lit it . " What do you think he 'll do when he finds you gone ? " I said . " An interesting question , " she said . And so we descended from Loon Lake , Clara 's clear eyes fixed on th farthest probe of the headlights , and I looking at her every other moment in her composure of total attention , going with the ride .  | Every morning she swept the dirt path outside the monastery wall . She always wore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know ? She was fifteen or sixteen years old but her hair was cut in the bowl cut of young children . Hair as black as night . She never smiled , but when she glanced at me there was such a flash of recognition from my soul that I went weak with joy . Oh , Warren . I used to wake up before dawn and do my chores and manage always to be at the gate when the sun rose and she came to do hers . She was the daughter of some working family down the street . They sweep the streets there with straw brooms . The unpaved streets . They sweep the dirt , compose it . They compose everything , they pick the fallen leaves one at a time . How did you get to her ? I wish you would n't phrase it that way , Lucinda . We knew each other on sight . We had to . My Japanese was less than rudimentary . Her English nonexistent . Only the tipper classes studied English . It was a great social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't aspire I that . Light me a cigarette , will you ? I have in my life just three times seen a face in dark light , at dusk dawn or against a white pillow , in which there is a recognizably perfec perception of the world , some matched reflection of the world in her eye light as terrifying and beautiful in equal measure . Am I coherent ? A moral light ? Is that what you mean ? She lives through her fear to her curiosity , there is a stillness of appu hension , like an animal 's stillness of perfect apprehension of its predato and it is gallantry to break the heart . I wish we had known each other when we were young . Her father and several uncles made up a delegation to complain hot my conduct to the monastery officials , who of course did not have to b told . I had broken every rule in the book . At the moment both side gathered to come down on us we slipped away together and took the trai to Tokyo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers ? I suppose so . I thought I could support us by teaching America customs and manners to Japanese businessmen . They wanted that . The were studying us intently . They listened to jazz and danced the Charles ton . You 're not crying , are you ? It makes me sad . I know what happened . I left the house one morning . I had an appointment to see someon at the U.S. embassy . It was a Saturday , the first day in September , 192 As I walked down the street , I lost my balance but suddenly peopl everywhere were screaming . The streets were cracking open . I ran bacl the city was falling down everywhere , I climbed over rubble , I saw he coming after me with her arms raised , the cobblestones heaved , the stree broke open , it filled with water , I reached her and grabbed her hand jus as the earth sank away and she fell in , she fell from my hands and wher the earth had been there was a steaming lake . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . It 's nothing . A line squall.  | The nights seemed to race by . The weather got colder . The freaks got nastier . We came one day to a town less promising than any I 'd seen . It was shut down and boarded . One tavern and one store were open . I do n't remember the name of this town , it was like a tree with just a branch or two still alive . In a lot beside the boarded-up railroad depot Sim Hearn gave the signal and the carney put up for business . In the evening we turned on the lights and a few mountain people straggled in but most of the time the freaks talked to each other because nothing else was doing . The rides went around empty . I thought Sim Hearn had lost his marbles . The next night the same thing , the wind blew through the booths and rattled the tent flaps , they sounded like over the mountains somewhere there was some gang war of Tommy guns going on . I thought Sim Hearn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cook built a fire on the ground and heated an ash can of water . He scrubbed his pots and pans with brown soap . Other people were packing . Mrs. I learn grabbed my arm and we stepped behind a wagon .  | " Hearn goes no farther , " she said . " Look , a sweater I have for you s ( you would n't be cold . " She was a pain in the ass with her presents . She brought me cigarettes oranges , she washed my clothes , all in secret of course . Nobody knev about it except the whole carney . It chilled me to think Sim Hearn might know it . But his distance fron me was unchanged and his peculiar authority maintained itself in m mind . It was as if no matter what I did to his wife I could never breal through that supreme indifference . I decided no man was that godlike I decided he did n't know . I wished he did know . Then I would n't be som ( nameless creature so low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning we struck everything but the show tent . We raise ( the wood shutters on the wagons and nailed them shut . We pushed th ( wagons into an old car barn across the tracks from the depot . After luncl a few people left with their bags or bundles . Nobody said so long or ever looked at anyone else . I think I was shocked . Despite all my other feeling ; about the carney , I could believe it was a privilege to be attached to it It angered me that people would walk away as if Hearn Bros. had no mor ( distinction than a mission flop . On the other hand , why should it be different ? Sim Hearn could n't car ( less if any one of them lived or died and they knew that . He was going to take the trucks down to Florida for the winter and let them get dowr there on their own . If they showed up , he 'd hire them ; if they did n't , that was all right too . Fanny the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moved . 1 saw Mrs. Hearn coming out of her trailer . " Fanny wheezes like calliope , ' she said . " Well , why does n't someone get a doctor ? " She put her hand on my cheek and looked in my eyes . " I worry to third , someday if we are not together what will happen to you . " Several of the freaks were leaving in a group . I was told to take a truer and drive them about fifteen miles to a town called Chester , where there was a spur line to Albany . It was the afternoon , already getting dark . Ir the cab with me sat the woman who took care of Fanny . The whole rid ( she wept and blew her nose , She spoke to herself in Spanish as if hel  | running stream of thoughts and sorrows came up over the banks every now and then . She thought I was n't looking when she lifted her skirt and fingered the metal clip of her garter to make sure it was fastened properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wad of bills that looked like a lot of money . I let off the truckload of freaks and their keepers in Chester , New York , and they hopped , climbed or were lowered from the tailgate . They went limping and scuttling into the waiting room carrying their bags like anyone . Why not ? They were mostly immigrants , after all  --  the same people but with a twist who worked for pennies in the sawmills or stood on the bread lines . But I imagined the stationmaster seeing through his grill this company of freaks in ordinary streetclothes approaching him with questions of schedule and tickets . Why did n't I get on the train with them ? Did I really want to drive a truck to Florida ? Did I want to bang Mrs. Magda Hearn in more states of the Union ? I thought of the freaks as pilgrims or revolutionaries of some angry religion nobody knew anything about yet . When I got back it was already dark . I could tell something was wrong , there were lots of cars there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running board . Beyond the lot was a hill that rose steeply , blacker than the sky , I could see its outline against the blue-black space of sky behind it . I thought I heard a scream . I listened  --  it was something else , a drumming of the earth or the sound of a rug being beaten . I walked toward the show tent , there was the dimmest light in there . A man stepped out of the shadow and put his hand on my arm . A flashlight shone in my eyes . " Who 's this ? " a voice said . And then I heard Magda Hearn . " It 's all right . He 's with the show . " My arm was still held and I could feel the consideration of this intelligence in the mind behind the light . The flashlight went off . I made out the figure of a state trooper , blocked hat and gun and Sans Browne belt .  | Then my arm was released , the marks of the fingers still on me , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the show tent . " Joe , " she sal ( " I want you to see , to understand . And I wait for you in the car . Do ye hear me ? " " What 's going on ? " I said . " What are the police doing here ? " " Joe , please to listen . " She was whispering in my ear and in each cycii of her crippled gait , the sibilance rose and fell in waves of urgency . Then I passed through the flaps . The show tent had a few rows of wooden bleachers and a small rin where the ponies could run around and the bareback sisters , if they we ' so inclined , could do their turns . A cat act had been featured here for while . The bleachers were empty . One bulb burned from the tent poly Eighty , maybe a hundred men stood in a circle in the dirt of the rin I could n't see over their backs but I heard the not unfamiliar nigl. music , the grunts and gurgling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythm got faster the crowd shouted encouragemen Then I heard that peculiar basso thumping as if the earth itself wqbeing drummed . Then an abrupt silence and the hoarse male roar c expiration . Whistles and cheers came from the crowd , men turne outward , I saw them drinking from bottles , exchanging money . Stag gering through the ring , buttoning his pants , was a grifter I reco4 nized . He sank down on his knees beside me , removed a flask fror his back pocket and took a long pull . Some sort of hot shame rose from the roots of my sex into my stomac and chest : it felt like illness . I pushed forward and saw Fanny on her bacl arms and legs flung outward . She was naked . She lay twitching , eac spasm jerking her flesh into ripples . She wheezed and fought for breatlThe sweated slathered flesh was caked in dirt , but with white crevasse in the folds of her and a red blotch in the middle . I was pushed aside an , spun around .

She was quickly brought to pitch , he great back rising and thumping into the earth , but this one did n't las  | long , and to great merry raucous hoots and jeers he stumbled out of the ring . Almost immediately another rube was moving forward for his turn . I jumped him just as he unbuckled his belt . I knocked him down and kicked him in the groin . He yowled , doubling up and clutching himself and I took his place crouching beside Fanny , facing them all , my fists clenched . I was screaming something , I do n't remember what , it stunned them for a second , and then they were laughing and taunting me and shouting at me to wait my turn . Fanny lay there trembling in her agony and her eyes were rolled into her head . Her mouth was open and giving off gasping animal wheezes . Maniacally , I felt betrayed by her , as by life itself , the human pretense . I became enraged with her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booze , was an organic stench , a bitter foul smell of burning nerves , and shit and scum . Then something flew out at me , a pint bottle , or a rock , and caught me low on the forehead . I went down , dazed , clutching my eyes , bright lights in my brain . I had fallen on Fanny , she was like some soft rotten animal carcass . Her arms helplessly went around me . I was panicked and tried to get free . My struggles were mistaken  --  I was pulled out of her grasp by my feet and dragged through the dirt and kicked and rolled and yanked to my feet and given a clout on the side of the head . I found myself on my knees , behind the crowd . I was wet . Blood streamed in my eye . But the ceremony continued . There were men drooling there . There were onanists . There were gamblers betting on the moment of death . Later there were men leaping on her , on each other , squatting on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoving bottles in her . There were gallants calling for order , for some law of decency if all pleasure was not to be lost . And Fanny giving up a human appearance by degrees , trumpeting her ecstasies to the killing passion of the rubes . From one only was there absolute quiet in this mayhem . I looked at him . His face was hidden in the shadow of his hat brim . You would n't know his connection with these spermy rites except for the indolence of his stance as he leaned against the bleacher supports with his bony arms  | folded and his ankles crossed . And I could swear I heard , through tl hoarse cries and shouts and shrieking and orgiastic death , the thoughtf and preoccupied sucking of Sim Hearn 's tongue on his teeth .

" She opened her Gladstone , interrupting herself to press her lips strongly on my mouth . She pulled the string tie of a small canvas coin sack and spilled a stream of coins on the bed .

At one point the coins sticking to the wet ass , the wet belly invented a use of Magda Hearn so unendurable to her that with the sal cry that must have come from her the day she fell twisting from trapeze , she flung herself off the bed  --  a moment 's silence , then t sickening shaming sound of bone and flesh slamming into the floor grunt .

After a wh I realized I was listening to the snores of an exhausted human being I thought I saw the first crack of light under the window shade . I off the bed and rolled my clothes and shoes into a bundle . I grabbed t stack of bills from the bureau . I unlatched the door quietly and close ( behind me . There were no other guests at the Pine Grove Motor Cou A thin frost lay on the windshield of the Model A. The wind blew . With all my might I reared back and threw the bills into the wind thought of them as the Fat Lady 's ashes . I found a privy up the hill behind the cabins and next to it an outdo shower .

I dried myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremble of stippled skin and turned my back on the cabins and struck off through the woods . I had no idea where I was going . It did n't particularly matter . I ran to get warm . I ran into the woods as to another world .  | At Kamakura he climbed the spiral stairs inside the largest Bud in the world . In the head of the largest Buddha , on the ledge of its c sat a tiny Buddha facing in the opposite direction . Simple idolatry I no interest for him , but a religion that joked held genuine interest . felt all at once the immense power of a communication that usec words . I acknowledge Warren 's lifelong commitment  --  cancel life commitment  --  fatal attraction for any kind of communication whe from words , flags , pigeons or the touch of fingertips in hope of a comet language , but we must remember how we are vulnerable to the repeti of our insights so that they tend to come to us not as confirmatioi something we already know but as genuine discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by degrees over a period of several d drifted south along the route of the old Tokaido . He saw thousand Buddhas lined up in trays in the tourist shops or ranked in legions at shrines , some in lead , some in wood , some carved in stone and dre in little knitted caps and capes . I Ic came to see in this ubiquitous phen emm the Buddha 's godlike propensity for self-division , the endless I  | tioning of himself into every perceivable aspect , an allegory made by the people of Japan from the cellular process of life . Thus enlightened , he turned his eyes on the people in the streets and the narrow shopping arcades , old women in black slapping along on their sandals , black-haired children of incredible beauty staring at him with their thumbs stuck in their plump cheeks , giggling pairs of young women in brightly colored kimonos , old shopkeepers with wispy goatees bowing as he passed , thoughtful peddlers , and young men who stopped in their tracks to glare at him and bear themselves with brazen umbrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect . Traveling down this avenue of thought lit only by stone lanterns filled with small stones in lieu of flames , he saw the true dereliction of the planet and realized anew that convictions of friendship , love , the assumption of culture , the certainty of calendars were fragile constructs of the imagination , and there was no place to live that was truly home , neither for him nor for the multitudinous islanders of Japan . In this he-took-for-appropriate state of mind , Warren arrived one day at road 's end , Kyoto , the strange city whose chief industry was meditation . He wandered from one monastery to the next , there were whole neighborhoods of them , but where , where was the sign that one was for him ? He was afflicted with a fluttering humility , not daring even to make inquiries , hovering at this gate or in that garden or touching down for just a moment of indecision before the small window with the visitor admission in yen painted in black calligraphy on white cardboard stuck into the grate as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , weary and full of self-condemnation , he happened to stumble up the step of a wooden verandah overlooking one of these beautiful monastery gardens of raked gravel and moss and stone . Thus launched , his large Caucasian person hurtled through a rice-paper door , splintering its laths , and like an infant being born , he found himself with the back half of him still on the porch side of the door and the front half in a room , looking with wide , even horrified eyes at the benign polished wood Buddha sitting facing him with a little altar of flowers on either side and the sinuous smoke of incense appearing to squinch up its eyes . He had made a terrible thunderous racket but nobody came running , nobody came shouting , and after he  | crawled the rest of the way into the room he set about calmly picking u the pieces and preparing in his mind the self-demeaning speech by whic he would beg the chance to make the most extended and profoun restitution . As it happened , the monastery was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this particular establishment in whic everyone was set free for twenty-four hours . Only after searching tlgrounds did Warren find an old caretaker willing to come look and sc the awful thing he had done . This old caretaker was smoking a cigarett which he held in his teeth . He took in smoke with each inhalation an with each exhalation smoke streamed out of his nostrils . He gazed at tlcarnage , the plumes of smoke from his nostrils indicating the depth an strength of each drawn breath , and it seemed to fascinate him that suc a perfect and modest structure as a sliding paper door should have bec turned into this . He was a very short , extremely bald old man , and he woi a torn ribbed undershirt and a pair of dirty white muslin knickers wit flapping ties at the waist but the peculiar thing was that he was nc unpleasant to look upon , it did not create feelings of pity or fear or othi degrees of patronization to look upon him . He picked up a broken lengt of lath and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pay for it , Warren said and removed from his pocket a wad of ye He unfolded the bills and looked at the old man squinting at the mom through the cigarette smoke . Warren peeled off one bill and put it in tI man 's hand . Then another . Then another . He kept waiting for a sign tit he 'd met the cost . He hesitated . The old man looked at him and pereml torily slapped his arm with the lath . Warren was so astonished he droppc the whole wad of bills in the old man 's hand . The caretaker put the bi into the pockets of his voluminous knickers , looked up at the Caucasia and swatted him again with the flat of the stick , this time across the sic of his face . Then he laughed , and in so doing released his cigarette , whit fell from his teeth and lay on the wooden floor glowing . Immediate Warren , thinking the whole place would go up , stepped on the tobac ( ember with his large shoe , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stepping with street shoes on the monaste floors . But the caretaker had turned and headed back to his garden shed wil  | its straw brooms and clay pots and small pyramids of gravel . Warren experienced the uncanny sense of a sharply learned lesson . He slept that night at a Western hotel in the downtown section of Kyoto and found in the nightstand drawer a volume in English that seemed to be the Buddhist equivalent of the Bible . Gautama was an Indian prince kept at home by his father so as not to see life in any aspect but its most luxurious . But one day he went out and saw a beggar , an old crippled man , a monk and a corpse . He was thus able to conclude despite his own royal existence that life was suffering . Why could n't he have figured that out without leaving the palace ? Warren wondered . If death exists , life has to be suffering . Did his father hide death from Gautama ? How was that done ? The book said the cause of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Perhaps a prince would never experience the desire to have , but how could he avoid the desire to be ? If desire by its nature is not gratified before it realizes itself , does it not exist in palaces too ? Does it not exist especially in palaces ? Nevertheless , he liked the story . He trusted Gautama Siddhartha and the simplicity of his reasoning . Not many people could get away with that sort of reasoning . He trusted the eightfold path for defeating desire and transcending suffering . Early the next morning Warren went back to the monastery . The place was a shambles . Doors and shoji walls were splintered and torn everywhere . There were recumbent bodies on the verandah , and in the garden a monk lay in a pool of vomit . All the walls were torn and hanging , bodies lay about as if dead . There was even a body lying across the crest of the tile roof . The monastery looked as if it had been bombed . But even as he gazed at this dismal scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the main monastery building , and though the bells were soft and delicate they had the astonishing effect of rousing the Zen Buddhists from their drunken stupor . One by one they groaned , rose to their feet and staggered off . And then around the corner came a man in white holding a staff of temple bells . His head was shaved , he was stout , the folds of his neck were like ruffles of a collar . He walked right tip to Warren and inquired in heavily accented English if he could be of help . I want to discuss with someone the possibility of enrolling here for Zen training ,  | Warren said . Of course , the monk said . If you do n't mind waiting more than two moments but less than six , I will approach the Maste for you . More than two but less than six , Warren thought as he waited in al anteroom beside the front gate . That 's a few . Shortly thereafter he wa escorted by the monk to a small room with a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cushions , and without having to be told , even by himself , he dropped to his knees and bowed to thi resident Master , who was seated and facing him with a face of genia amusement . It was the old caretaker . On the one day off of the year fo all his followers and monks , he , in perfect realization , had stayed when he was . The Master was smoking a cigarette . Another monk came by an ( listened . He was laughing and telling the monk , in Japanese , about his firs meeting with Warren . Gusts of smoke came out of him . As the story wa elaborated , the Master rose and began to act it out , and there to Warren ' astonishment was a perfect imitation of himself , the way he carries himself , his walk , the tone of his voice , the shock on his face as the Iatl slapped his cheek . The Japanese laughed till there were tears in their eyes Soon Warren began to smile and then he too exploded into laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow that the Master si perfectly realized whatever he chose to do , that a kind of magnetic fief was formed in which whoever was in his presence drew on its power . Tha is why interviews with the Master were so highly prized . His perfectioi was an impersonal force that you could feel and hope someday to manifes from yourself on a continuous basis . If he laughed , it was perfect laughter and you had to laugh too . If he chose to cry , everyone around him woull have to weep . But where did it come from , how did it happen ? All Wane could work out was that the Master lived totally to the fullness of his bein ; each and every moment of his existence . He was completely of th moment , then and there , in which you found him . Nothing of him wa deadened by the suffering of his past life and there was no striving or fea in him for his future . Would the Master feel a need to write poems ? No , because poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if the Master is one in every instant with what he sees and hear  | d feels , the poem is not the Master 's written need but the world singing the Master . No , because the poem is a cry of the unborn heart . Yes , because the gem perfectly embodies the world , there is no world without poem . Your register apologizes for rendering nonlinear thinking in linear laniage , the apperceptions of oneness in dualistic terminology . However , sere is no difficulty representing the absolute physical torture of Warren enfield 's commitment to Zen meditation . He could not physically ac ) mplish even the half lotus , his spine threatened to snap , his legs seemed be in a vise ; even the mudra  --  the bowl-shaped position of the hands , ie thumbs lightly touching , a simple relaxed representation in the hand the flow from right to left , from left to right , the rocking crescent ) ntinuity of the universe intimations of stars and ancient Eastern recogtions  --  became under the torment of his distracted physically weeping ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear ) d anguish , the exact opposite of the right practice , the body imprisoned , re mind entirely personal and self-involved and then God help you if you ) d off every now and then as who could not , sitting like a damn beer ? etzel twelve , sixteen hours a day he comes along and hits you with the imn slapstick the goddamn yellow-skinned bastard the next time he hits e with that stick I 'm going to get up and wrap it around his goddamn allow neck and break a goddamn Buddha doll over his goddamn shaven gad this is not right thinking but tell me Gautama enlighten me if what ru say is true why is it so difficult to attain would n't it all make a lot more nse if everyone could do it if everyone could be it without even thinking thout being anything less before , without the death of my darling , and en drowning in the cold black coalwater of collapsed mines miles of ralstone sinking slowly upon their chests , or bullets perforating them like tout coupons supposing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what then what happens outside me how do I help Local ioi io the Western Federation of Miners , Smelters , Sheepdippers and Zenssers , and then there 's the food , look what we wait for when at last the to little tinkly bell rings and we may unpretzel ourself and try to regain e circulation in our swollen limbs , little bits of pickled leather , or some solute excresence of the lowest sea life lightly salted or a congealed ball  | of rice dipped in some rank fermented fluid that smells to me like the stuff we dipped the pigeons in to kill the lice . No , there is no problem expressing the inner record of Warren Penfield 's quest for enlightenment : the whining despair , the uncharacteristic epithet , the rage , the backsliding giving up and consequent self-nauseation , the stubborn goings on , all of this silent , in a temple hall of inscrutable meditators , all of whom reminded him of the immigrant kids in the Ludlow Grade School around him totally serene and insulated in their lack of language the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't the storms of self taste fire and thunder across their brainbrow , why are n't they as sick and unsure of their dangerous selves as I am of mine , leading then to the false Zen-like casuistry as , for example , if we are to press ourselves on the world sticking to it like a decal , if I am one with the rocks the trees the stars why is my memory invalid and why then are the images of Clara on our beds of slag in the cool mountain dusk of Colorado forbidden me , I am my memory and the images of my past are me , and if I am the rocks and stones and trees , Wordsworth , rocked round in earth 's diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees , why are my phantoms less real why are the ghostvoices of my mama and papa less real why is the mud of the Marne less real why must I exclude exclude , if everything is now and mind is matter is not everything valid is not meditation the substance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to render the casually developed outer circumstances of this monastic life , the old Master becoming at some times demonic in his teaching , a destroyer of ego , of humble ordinary lines of thought , an army of right practice , right understanding overwhelming the frail redoubts and trenches of Warren 's Western mind . One day they were in the temple and he came in screaming , naked , climbed the Buddha like a bee alighting on a flower and bending it with its own honeygravid weight and they watched shocked and stunned as a beautiful polished wood Buddha toppled to the floor under the Master , an act of profound desecration with sexual impact , and the Buddha lay split like a log , a piece of wood the aperture of an earthquake and nothing was ever said of it again .  | He was a violent old man , one day Warren was admitted for his counseling and the Master threw a cup of cold green tea in his face and that was the lesson of the day . One day he lectured them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were all Masters when you first came through the gate and now look at you , I have more respect for the horse that pulls the shitwagon than I have for you  --  screaming and growling and trilling in the Japanese way of singsong , Warren prostrate with all the rest . But everyone took it as material to be pondered and worked out , it was only a style of pedagogy and only someone stupid enough to take emotions seriously would be shocked threatened or angered by the serene antics of the realized Buddha spirit of such a great Master . Warren finally reached the preliminary kindergarten stage of getting his own koan , a paradoxical question to form the empty mind of meditation . Each devotee received his own koan like a rabbit 's foot to stroke and treasure , an unanswerable question to torment him month after month , perhaps year after year , until enlightenment burst over and he was able to answer it when the Master gently asked it of him the hundred millionth time . Warren walked in bowed , kneeled on the straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible as a plume of cigarette smoke and Warren knew the standard koans , the famous ones , there were actually collections of them like college course outlines but the one given to him he had never heard before or read anywhere and it was delivered by the Master with a shake of his head , a sigh and a glance of helpless supplication at the ceiling : Penfield-san , said the Master , if this is a religion for warriors , what are you doing here ? Warren thanked him , bowed and backed out of the room even though the Master looked as if he was going to say something more . Later in his first pondering of this infinitely resounding question he squatted by his favorite place , near the garden gate beyond the gravel garden , and saw through the slats as for the first time the beautiful little girl who swept the street .  | drove out of the mountains through the night and found the way Utica , New York , coming into city streets in the rain at three o'cloc passing freight yards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wa her , I bumped the car gently across the railroad tracks and headed sou and west toward Pittsburgh . I wanted to log as many miles as I could before Bennett got up in t morning . By dawn I was clear-eyed exhausted , feeling my nerves finely strung , t weariness in the hinges of my jaws , you are never more alert . Red ligl in the dawn at intersections between fields , I saw the light of dawn she clear down the telegraph wires like a surge of power , I passed milk true and heard train whistles the sun came up and flooded my left eye sudder it was day commerce was on the roads we had survived Loon Lake a. were cruising through the United States of America . I woke her for breakfast , we walked into a diner  --  some town in Per sylvania . Clara iii her fur jacket and long dress and junior in his knicki and sweater .

I bought Clara a black merchant marine pullover and a pea jacket . I made her change her clothes in the back of the store . Then I did . Mr. Penfield had pressed upon me about eighty dollars in clean soft ones and fives , bills that looked as if they had spent years in a shoe box . I added to this the forty dollars or so of my own fortune . The clothes had come to twenty-eight , and another dollar and change for breakfast . " What kind of money do you have ? " " Money ?

We took the bumps in unison , we leaned at the same angle on the curves . I did n't know where we were going and she did n't ask . I drove to speed . I stopped wondering what she was feeling , what she was thinking . She was happy on the move , alert and at peace , all the inflamed spirit was lifted from her . She had various ways of arranging herself in the seat , legs tucked up or one under the other , or arms folded , head down , but in any position definitive , beautiful . Come with me Late that afternoon we were going up a steep hill along the Monongahela , Pittsburgh spreading out below us , stacks of smoke , black sky , crucible fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile . We were im some town in eastern Ohio , maybe it was Steubenville , I'in not  | sure . On a narrow street I found the Rutherford Hayes , a four-story h ( with fire escapes and a barber 's pole at the entrance . I took a deep bre and pulled up to the curb . In the empty lobby were the worn upholstered chairs and half-d , rubber plants that would have been elegance had I not been educate ( Loon Lake . I had never stayed at a hotel but I knew what to do from movies . I got us upstairs without incident and tipped the bellboy fifty cei " Yes , suh ! " he said . I chain-locked the door behind him . We had a corner room with large windows , each covered with a d green pull shade and flimsy white curtains . Everything had a wornlook , a great circle of wear in the middle of the rug . I liked that . I lii the idea of public accommodation , people passing through . Bennett co keep his Loon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top flc we had a view of greater Steubenville . In the bathroom was a faucet ice water . Clara , who had been in hotels before , found the experience unexc tional . She opened her overnight bag and took over the bathroom smoked a cigarette and listened to the sounds of her bathing . I k looking around the room as if I expected to see someone else . Who ? were alone , she was alone with me and nobody knew where we wen was smiling . I was thinking of myself crouched in the weeds in the c night while a train goes by and a naked girl holds a white dress before mirror . This was a double bed I had booked and she had n't even blinked . T would seem reason to hope . But for Clara Lukals there was no necess significance in sleeping beside somebody in the same bed . She came of the bathroom without a stitch . I undressed and turned out the li as cool in my assumptions as I could be . A high whine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her elbow was what I got whe happened to move against her in the dark . Just testing . She curled up with her back toward mc , and those vertebrae whic had noticed and loved were all at once deployed like the Maginot Li  | In the morning she woke out of sorts , mean . " What in hell am I doing here ? " she muttered . " Jesus , " she said , looking at me . " I must be out of my mind . " I was stunned . My first impulse was to appeal . " Look at him , hunky king of the road there . Oh , this is great  --  this really is great . " She snapped up the window shade and looked out . " God damn him , " she said . " And his wives and his boats and choo-choo trains . " She began to dress . She held up blouses , skirts , looked at them , flung them down . She sat abruptly on the bed with her arms full of clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " I told you I 'd get you out of there and I did . Did n't She did n't answer .

" Go back to your fancy friends and see what they do for you . Look what they already done . " I got out of bed , pulled on my pants and socks , and stuck my feet in my shoes . " Where are you going ? " she said . " Here , " I said , taking out my wallet . I crumpled a couple of singles and threw them on the floor . " That and a twitch of your ass will get you back to the loons . " " You 're not leaving , " she said . " You 're not leaving me here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for old men , " I said . I put on my shirt and combed my hair in the mirror over the dresser . " It 's probably as good as you can do anyhow . " The mirror shattered . I did n't know what she had thrown . When I went for her she was reaching for the Gideon Bible to throw that . I grabbed her arm and we knocked the bedside lamp to the floor . I pinned her to the bed . She tried to bite me . I held her by the wrists and put my knees on each point of the pelvis.  | " You 're hurting me ! " I moved back and let go of her . She lay still . A queer bitter smell came from her . It was anger that aroused her , confron tation was the secret . But when I found her she was loving and soft and she shrank awa softer and more innocent of her feelings than I had dreamed . I held her , I loved the narrow shoulders , the small-boned frailness o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was kissing her eyes , he cheeks , but she cried in the panic of the sensation , her legs could n't fine their place , she was like a swimmer kicking out or like someone trying to shinny up a pole .

But she did n't seem to be aware of how I felt , there was this distractec spirit of her , her head shook from side to side with bursts of voice , like sobs , as if someone was mourned . Our lovemaking was like song or like speech . " Do n't you see , " I askec again and again , " do n't you understand ? " And she shook her head fron side to side in her distraction .

In my moment of stunned paralytic grief I groan I go off bucking think I hear her laugh . For several days we made our life sleeping till mid-morning and getting on the road and driving again till the sun went down and we could fin ( a bed . We drove through boarded-up towns , we ate blue-plate specials an ( we slept in rooming houses with linoleum on the floor and outhouses it back or in small motor-court cabins with the sound all night of the truck rolling past . Night and morning we made love it was what we did ou occupation our exercise . But always with great suspense in my mind . never knew if it would happen again . I did n't have the feeling anythini was established in her . She lucked in a kind of lonely self-intensification  | She slept without touching me , she slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to sleep and it was as if I were n't there . I would think about this lying in the dark while she slept . I was there for her , I was what she assumed , and I was willing to be that , to be the assumption she did n't even know she was making . And then one day she 'd discover that she loved me . Once in a while , usually in the numb exhaustion of daybreak , I 'd look into her face and see an aspect there of the acknowledgment I wanted in the gold-washed green eyes . There would be humor in them . The lips slightly swollen and open , the small warm puff of breath . She 'd giggle to see neither of us was dead and she 'd give me a cracklipped kiss a soft dry kiss with the hot pulp of her lip against mine . She liked to be inside her appetites and her feelings . Whatever they were . One day in a rainstorm I skidded off the road . I was frantically spinning the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned white , opaque , but Clara was laughing and shrieking like a kid on a carnival ride . We thudded into a ditch . Water softened the canvas top and began to leak through and we sat at a tilt as if in a diving plane , in clouds . I thought we might drown . Then we felt the car rise , somehow the water floated us free , and when the storm passed over , we gently drifted a half mile or so in the flood like some stately barge down a stream . She loved it , she loved every second of it , her fingers gripping my arm , the nails digging into my skin . Sometimes we went out at night walking some main street to a local movie . She liked to stop in a tavern and drink ten-cent beers , she liked the looks she got , the sexual alert that went off every time she walked into a bar or a diner . One time someone came over to the booth and started to talk to her as if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to do . He was an amiable fellow with a foolish grin , but with the strength in him of belonging in this bar , of being known in this bar , this town , he looked down and saw my knife , the tip making an indentation in the blue shirt and the sprung gut . He was genuinely astonished , they do n't use knives in boondocks of the Midwest , he backed off with his palms up . She had turned pale . " What 's the idea , do you know what you 're  | doing ? " She spoke in a soft urgent whisper leaning toward me over the table . " I do , " I said , " and if you do n't stand up and get your ass moving I 'll do the same to you . " Outside I grabbed her arm . She was in a cold rage but I had the feeling , too , that I had done right , that I had shown her something she wanted to see . " You know something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're crazy , you know that ? " I thought they were the first words of love I 'd heard from her . In Dayton , Ohio , I saw in the rear-view mirror the unmistakable professional interest of a traffic cop as we drove away from his intersection . " I have not been smart , " I said . " I suppose my mind has been on other things . " I made a sharp turn into a side street and started looking for the poor part of town . " What 's the matter ? " " A German convertible with bud vases and New York plates . You do n't often see that in these here parts . " She thought awhile . " Is this a hot car ? " " In a manner of speaking . " Soon enough we were going through the dingy sections where the bums were standing on the sidewalks and the garbage spilled into the streets . The Buckeye State Used Cars enterprise looked grim and satisfactorily seedy , I turned in there and commenced a negotiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not even a book on such a car . I said that was because it was so expensive they did n't figure anyone could afford it . He said maybe so , but how could he sell a car where you could not get the parts if they broke ?

I said it was my family 's car and since when did you walk around with papers of your own family 's car ? Ile said why did I want to sell my family 's car ? I said I was running away to get married and needed cash . " flow are you  | going to run if you do n't have no car anymore ? " he said . " I 'm going to buy a modest well-tuned vehicle from you , " I said , looking with bright honest earnestness into his face . He walked around the car several times . He glanced at Clara in the front seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . " That is my fiancee , " I said to him softly , " of whom they do n't approve . " I could see him thinking : They would n't go after their own kid . Come with me Combust with me " Someday , " Clara said over the noise , " maybe you 'll be able to buy it back , or one like it . " " What ? " " I said someday you could hope to get it back . " " I 've got my car , " I said , pounding the dashboard . " I 've got papers for it . I 've got a hundred fifty simoleons in my pocket . Is that bad ? We can get to California if we 're careful . " " California ? " " That 's where we 're going . Did n't you know ? " " I was n't informed , " she said , holding on to the leather strap over the door . She peered ahead , frowning . I had taken in partial trade a 1930 Chevrolet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floorboards that jumped in the air every time we hit a bump . It had a high polish on its tan-and-brown body and admitted to fifty thousand miles .  | I did n't know dead people were that unusual . I saw them all the time . I wandered around holding my bottle and seeing these dead hunkies lying on tables . I dragged my blanket around behind me . I was n't frightened . My father would smile at me . " When I was older I began to understand things a little more . I thought , for instance , that anyone who was dead had to have a hole in them . I did n't know people died without holes in them . Then I figured it out one day . Some old guy was being dressed who died of natural causes . He 'd made it all the way . So I knew then about natural death . " But it was just the business , you know , it was nothing special , we lived in an apartment right over the business I played after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father driving up with his hearse , they 'd back up into the garage and he and my brother took the body into the hack . And that was the way things were on West Twenty-ninth Street . " And then my mother died but my father did n't handle it , someone else from another funeral parlor came and took her away . Just like doctors do n't treat their own families . But maybe it was because she was religious .  | None of our church got buried with us . We were Greek Orthodox but the business was nondenominational . My father was not highly regarded in church . I saw more Romans and Jewish rabbis at Lukafs ' than I did priests . Anyway , my father moped around a long time . He did n't know what to do with me . He hired this black lady to take care of me . She was okay but she drank . She stood at the window whenever there was a funeral downstairs . She 'd count the numbers of cars to see how important the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Sometimes she called me to come look and I began to look too . You 'd see all these flowers in the flower cars , sometimes in three , four cars of flowers , it was too much , like huge mounds of popcorn , I did n't like it . I hate cut flowers . All my life they made a stink coming up through the floor below , there was always somebody downstairs you could smell flowers through the dumbwaiter . " But then if it was really a big affair it would be worth watching . My father and brother all dressed up in their shiny black suits . He 'd hire on men on these days . People coming to pay their respects , filling the parlor , crowds standing out on the street . And then outside all the cars in a line , double-parked with their headlights on , all these black mourners ' cars twice around the block . And the cops would be there checking on who showed up , standing across the street and watching . And the photographers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in the News or the Mirror there was a picture of somebody and in the background the canopy said Lukafs ' Funeral Parlor . " But he did n't need the publicity and he did n't care . He was just some dumb hunky , he did n't care about anything , he did n't talk much , he just did this work . And he got this clientele over the years , he was n't in the rackets himself , but he kept his mouth shut and did n't make judgments and he just got to be the one they used . He did n't care who he buried , why should he , the kind of work he did why get excited . After a while he had to expand . He bought the brownstone next door , and put a new streamlined face across both houses . And then there was a showroom and a reception desk . " And I was pretty grown-up now . I would n't stay in school . I 'd worked  | for a while at the five-and-ten just to have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed someone for the reception desk and to answer the phone who could talk right . So he asked me . So I thought , Why not ? I mean when I was a kid I used to get it at school . That 's why I had no friends at St. Clare 's . They came around at Halloween with sheets on and rang the front bell . Clara Cadaver , Clara Cadaver . Well , shit , I only had boyfriends , anyway . I mean as a kid my friends were boys . I played street hockey . " But anyway , I did n't mind . I wore a black dress . I wore stockings and high-heeled shoes . I had an allowance for the beauty parlor . And that was my job . I got to meet some real people . It was an entree , as they say . What 's that sound ? The engine does n't sound right . " " No , " I said , " it 's okay . Maybe I need a little oil . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are ? " " Are you hungry ? " " A little . " I had a terrible feeling , a chilled feeling because of her lineage , her criminal lineage , I thought of it as a caste , some kind of contamination she had been born into through no fault of her own and I thought it was mine now too ; if I wanted her , what she was was mine too , what she brought with her we both had now . But I was also happy that she had told me , that in the dreamlife of the road the hours sitting next to each other and facing in the same direction brought things out we might not have otherwise said . We told each other about our lives , we gave each other our lives while we looked at the road backward into ourselves . Even though afterward we did n't remember what we said , or were too proud to admit we remembered . " We lived across the river from each other , you realize that ? We could have shouted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little did we know we were destined to meet ! We saw the same Tom Mix movies . We ran along the sidewalks pointed to the sky at the same airships ! " " What ? " " No , really , playing hockey " ? 1 wanted to make her smile ? " do n't you  | remember ? Maybe our teams played each other . We made the puck from the end of the wooden cream-cheese box , right ? We wrapped it in black tape , am I right ? " It seemed very important in this moment to make her smile . " Do n't you remember ? Do n't you remember the I cash clothes ' man ? On Twenty-ninth Street ? The water wagon , running alongside it for the spray ? Do n't you remember how we went to the candy store for ice cream ? " " What are you talking about ? " " No , really , Clara . One hot afternoon we bought Dixie cups and stood on the sidewalk in the sun with our wooden spoons . You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wn Clara fell asleep I put on my coat , closed the door quietll and went out to look around . In addition to everything else snow had hi this burg , a heavy wet fall that stuck to your eyelashes and got into you : shoes .  | The rooming house was highway robbery  --  twelve dollars a week , paic in advance . Restaurants came to another two , three dollars a day . If I tool her to the movies , another forty , fifty cents . I had even bought her a gold wedding band  --  for her protection , I said I had n't told her there was no money to get the valves reground . Shf thought we were in Jacksontown another day or two at the most . I could manage two day-coach fares to Chicago . But what would we do in Chi cago  --  freeze our ass there ? And so , hunched in his khaki coat from the Great War , the big spender wandered through downtown Jacksontown , Indiana  --  Heart of the Hoo sier Nation , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank , the library , the city hall , the armory . Stores occupied , the black cars parker at angles against the curbs , he notices the traffic , a heavy traffic rollint  | quietly through the snow , the sky gray , heavy flakes like soundproofing tamping down the horns , muffling the engines , even the streetcars grinding along hushed in the flanges , sparks flaring in the dark afternoon , the dark turrets of the armory the dark green cannon on the lawn with the mantle of white snow . I saw everywhere on every street jalopies of every description , valises and boxes strapped to their fenders , children and grandparents high in the rear seats , scarfs wrapped around their heads . I saw furniture covered with blankets tied with rope on the beds of broken-down trucks . I saw out-ofstate license pla es : Kentucky Tennessee Georgia Arkansas Michigan Missouri . I boarded the Railroad Street trolley to see what would happen . It banged its way sharply around corners and picked up speed . Soon it was out of the downtown area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after block . Eventually it veered into a dark street , a canyon of the sides of buildings , moving slowly now , many men walking in the street , the bell clanged , an unbroken chain-link fence blurred my eyes , if I opened the window I could touch it . Last stop the doors hissed open at the main gate . Here a crowd of men stood waiting to get in , a quiet intense crowd not orderly but silent . The snow came down . Even as I watched , the crowd grew pulsing like something underwater . Behind the locked gates uniformed men stood chatting as if nothing was going on . I looked up at the block-long sign across the tops of two buildings . BENNETT AUTOBODY NUMBER SIX was what it said . That evening I took Clara to dinner at the Jacksontown Inn , the best restaurant in town . It had tablecloths , candles , black busboys , and the roast beef au jus went for two dollars and a half . " I see in the paper where every state is covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She eyed me warily . The true color of her hair beginning to come through , her hair was fluffier too , she had given up the beauty parlor  | she believed they would ruin her if she had her hair done in the Mic west . " Anyway , " I said , " I did a little exploring while you were having a nal We could be in worse places . There are jobs here , people have money i their pockets , they 're shopping in the stores and going to the movies . The have three movie houses downtown . " She cut her roast beef . " And you want to hear something funny ? The big employer and wh everything is humming is your friend and mine Frankie W. Bennett . H Number Six plant . " She put down her knife and fork , dabbed at her mouth with her napki and sat there . " Oh , Clara , " I said . " I 'd be happy if I could just look at you across the table for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of roast beef , " she said . " You did n't wear your gold ring ! " " I forgot . " I ate and drank energetically . " Anyway , " I said , " as long as we 're stuc here  --  so long  --  as we 're here awhile  --  I thought I 'd tap into old Fran ? build up our cash reserve for the run to California . " " What does that mean ? " " Well , they 're hiring at the Number Six plant . " " So ? " A sip of water from my cut-glass goblet . " I caught on there this after noon . Nothing to it . I just gave them my shining innocent face . I meal there were these guys standing around with their toolboxes and employ ment records all wanting the same dumb unskilled jobs I put in for . N contest . " " Why ? " ? " Because it was obvious I did n't have a union background . They don ' want someone who 's a wiseass . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why did you do it ? " she said . " I thought I explained , " I said " I thought I explained that . " She did n't say anything , we resumed ( lining , Occasionally she 'd I(x)k u !  | and smile sweetly at me , in the silence there at the Jacksontown Inn the unarguable terror of things was driven home to me . " I do n't see why you should get on your high horse , " I said . " Is it any worse than sleeping in his bed ? Is it any worse than stealing his car ? " " I think I 've got to leave now . " She stood . " Do you mind if I pay the damn check ? " We walked through the snow back to the room . I grabbed her elbow , she shrugged me off . " Clara , for God 's sake , what is it I 've done , after all ? I got a job ! A job ! Is it a fucking crime to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the real world now , do n't you understand ? There 's no money ! " In the room she started to pack . I willed myself to be calm , there were other roomers on the same floor , I did n't need landlady trouble on top of everything else . " Clara , please do n't be like this . Please listen . All right , this is the worst shithole town in the frozenest fucking country there is . It 's so fucking cold I ca n't believe how cold it is . And there 's no reason to stay here . Except that it 's Bennett 's ! That 's why , Clara . That is the true reason why . Because I 'm gon na work his line without his knowing and walk away from his machine with my wages in my pocket and he 's going to get us to California ! That 's why . " She was still . " You hear me , Clara ? Because it 's living right under his nose . That 's why . Because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous and the classiest thing . That 's why . " She sat on the side of the bed . " And what am I supposed to do here all day while you work his line and make your classy wages ? Huh , big boy ? What am I supposed to do ? " My God , it was laughable , it was heartbreaking but at least she asked the question . Neither of us was twenty ! We were children  --  who were we , what chance did we have ? In her question was one half of an instant 's perceiving , dimly appreciated , of only the most obvious possibility of life comprising the history of mankind . I sat on the side of the bed next to her , whispering in her ear , " You do n't realize what you 've done to me . Me , the carnet ' kid ! You 're making an honest man of him , it 's horrible . I have all these godawful longings to  | work to support you , to make a life with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care where , I do n't care if it 's the North Pole , I ' do any fucking thing to keep you in bonbons and French novels , Clar and it 's all your fault . " " Oh Jesus , he 's crazy , this boy is crazy . " But I felt this weird tickle-behind-the-spine unprecedented truth c what I was saying . Before I said it I had n't known I felt it : we coul change , we could make our lives however we wanted ! And the steps Clar had taken to molldom and to the high forest of Loon Lake were daint steps , steps avoiding the muck of her reality and mine . And this was wher we truly belonged , not on the road but stationary , in one place , workin it all out in the hard life . " You got anything better to do ? " I said . She sighed . " That 's the crying shame of it . " Data comprising life F. W. Bennett undergoing review . Shown in two instances twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding workers ' needs . His dramatization suggests life devoted almost entirely to selfish accumulation of wealth and ritual use thereof according to established patterns of utmost class . It is alleged he patronizes unsavory elements of society for his business gain . It is alleged that he is sexually exploitative . It is suggested he is at least unmoved by the violent death of another human attributable to his calculated negligence . Countervailing data re his apparent generosity to worthless poet scrounge and likely drunkard Warren Penfield . A hint too of his pride in Lucinda Bailey Bennett 's aviation achievements . A heart too for spunky derelict kids .  | Your register respectfully advises the need for additional countervailing data . History suggests of the class of which Mr. F. W. Bennett is a member no unalloyed spirit of evil the dimes which John D. Rockefeller senior gave away compulsively to people in the street became the multimillions of his sons ' philanthropies . Andrew Carnegie 's beneficence well attested , as well as William Randolph Hearst 's Milk Fund for Babies . And examination of the general practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be explained entirely as self-serving public relations but may be seen as manifesting anthropologically identified principle of potlatch observed operating in primitive social systems throughout the world from northern forest aboriginals to unclad natives of tropical paradises . The principle regardless of currency of benefaction breadfruit pigs palm fronds or dollars is that wealth is accumulated so that it can be given away thus bringing honor to the giver . I refer to an American landscape from every region of which rise hospitals universities libraries museums planetaria parks think-tanks and other institutions for the public weal all of which are the benefactions of the utmost class .  | I cite achievements F. W. Bennett in his lifetime the original endowments of the Western miners ' Black Lung Research Facility , Denver , Colorado . The Gymnasium of Miss Morris ' School , Briarcliff Manor NY , the Mexican Silver Workers ' Church of the Holy St. Clare , Popxacetl Mexico , The Bennett Library on the grounds of Jordan College , Rhinebeck NY , the Bennett Engineering Institute , Albany NY , plus numerous ongoing benefactions of worthy charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicized . I attribute to F. W. Bennett in his death a last will and testament of such public generosity as to receive acknowledgment on the front page of the New York limes data available upon request .  | Generally speaking a view of the available economic systems that have been tested historically must acknowledge the immense power of capitalism to generate living standards food housing education the amenities to a degree unprecedented in human civilization . The benefits of such a system while occasionally random and unpredictable with periods of undeniable stress and misery depression starvation and degradation are inevitably distributed to a greater and greater percentage of the population . The periods of economic stability also ensure a greater degree of popular political freedom and among the industrial Western democracies today despite I'I occasional suppression of free speech quashing of dissent corruption of public officials and despite the tendency of legislation to serve the interests of the ruling business oligarchy the poisoning of the air water the chemical adulteration of food the obscene development of hideous weaponry the increased costs of simple survival the waste of human resources the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of life under capitalism by any criterion are ill far greater than under state socialism in whatever forms it is found British Swedish Cuban Soviet or Chinese . Thus the good that fierce advocacy of personal wealth accomplishes in the historical run of things outweighs the bad . And while we may not admire always the personal motives of our business leaders we can appreciate the inevitable percolation of the good life as it comes down through our native American soil . 11 You can not observe the bounteous beauty of our country nor take pleasure in its most ordinary institutions in peace and safety without acknowledging the extraordinary achievement of American civilization . There are no Japanese bandits lying in wait on the Tokaidoways after all . Drive down the turnpike past the pretty painted pipes of the oil refineries and no one will hurt you .  | No claim for the perfection of F. W. Bennett , only that like all men he was of his generation and reflected his times in his person . We know that by the nineteen-fifties at an advanced age he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate fully on a first-name basis with major labor leaders playing golf of course at that age he only drove a ball twenty or thirty yards but they called him Mr. Frank and with humor admired his sportif outfits the beige-yellow slacks the brown-and-white shoes with the tassels the Hawaiian shirt with his breasts showing . Note is made here too that this man had a boyhood , after all , woke in the astonishment of a bedsheet of sap suffered acne had feelings which frightened him and he tried to suppress was cruelly motivated by unthinking adults perhaps rebuffed or humiliated by a teacher these experiences are not the sole prerogative of the poor poverty is not a moral endowment and a man who has the strength to help himself can help others . I cite too the ordinary fears of mortality the inspection of a fast-growing mole on the side of the nose blood in the stool a painful injury or the mournful witness of the slow death of a parent all this is given to all men as well as the starting awake in the nether hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name relationships nationality place in life all data of specificity wipe out amnesiatically asiatically you do n't even know the idea human it is such a low hour of the night and he shares that with all of us . I therefore declare F. W. Bennett to embody the fullness of the perplexity of living , as they say . I cite here his voice which people who knew him only in his later years believed to be ridden and cracked with his age but in fact his voice had always been rather high reedy  | with a gravelly consistency around its edges and some people found this menacing but others thought it avuncular especially after his operation for cataracts when they wear those goggle glasses . But it was one of those voices of such individual character that people who never heard it can imagine it just by the mention of his name and those standing in the great crush of honors at his funeral could believe themselves likely to hear it for many years afterward as if a man of this strong presence could not release his hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manifest a half life , probably , of twenty-five thousand years .  | I was on headlights . First I attached with four screws two metal frames the screws lay in a bin the frames met at the convergence of two small belts the left frame from the left belt the right down the line . Sometimes the pieces did n't match , sometimes the wrong piece came down the wrong side and sometimes , the thread not being true , I had to hammer the screws in , everybody did . Next I affixed the crossed pieces to the inside of a curl of tin shaped like a flowerpot . I then inserted through a hole in the pot about four feet of insulated wire that came to hand dangling from a big spool overhead . I snipped the wire with a pair of shears , knotted the wire so it would n't slip and put the whole thing back on the line for the next man , who did the electrical connections , slapped on the chrome and sent it on to the main line for mounting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . High above my head the windows of the great shed hung open like bins and the sun came through the meshed glass already broken down , each element of light attached to its own atom of ( lust ; 111 ( 1 there was no light  | except on the dust and between was black space , like the night around stars . Mr. Autobody Bennett was a big man who could do that to light , make the universe punch in like the rest of us . And all around me the noise of running machines , conveyor belts , the creaking of pulleys , screeching of worked metal , shouts , the great gongs of autobodies on the line , the blast of acetylene riveting , the rattling of moving treads , the cries of mistakes and mysterious intentions . And then continuously multiplied the same sounds repeated compounded by echoes . An interesting philosophical problem : I did n't know at any moment what I heard was what was happening or what had already happened . It was enough to make me think of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they speed things up and I 'm going too slow I drop one of the tin pots on the wrong side of the belt the guy there is throwing tires on wheel rims and giving the tubes a pump or two of air he ignores my shouts he ca n't take the time . And then the foreman is coming down the line to pay me a call I ca n't hear him but I do n't have to  --  a red bulging neck of rage . And then they stop coddling us and throw the throttle to full and this is how I handle it : I am Fred Astaire in top hat and tails tossing up the screws into the holes , bouncing the frames on the floor and catching them in my top hat of tin . I twirl the headlight kick it on the belt with a backward flip of my heel . I never stop moving and when the belt is too slow for me I jump up and stomp it along faster , my arms outstretched . Soon everyone in the plant has picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes pirouetting along , putting stars next to each name on his clipboard . And descending from the steel rafter by insulated wire to dance backward on the moving parade of car bodies , Mr. Bennett himself in white tie and tails . He 's singing with a smile , he 's flinging money from his hands like stardust . Shit , how many more hours of this . . . I thought of Clara I thought of us driving to California in the spring . And then I thought , What if she just left , what if she met someone and said to him , /low do I get out of here ?  | And then I resolved not to think at all , if I could n't think well of Clar I 'd turn my mind from her knowing I was racked , knowing I couldn physically feel hope in this hammering noise . But I did n't have to try n1 to think , by the middle of the afternoon my bones were vibrating lil tuning forks . And so it had me , Bennett Autobody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the machines taking their form a mile away the big shed , those black cars composed bit by bit from our life and tl gift of opposition of thumb and forefinger , those precious vehicles , eac one a hearse . On the other hand everyone had the same problem I heard stories people hauling off on a foreman , or pissing on the cars , or taking a sled ? hammer to them , good stories , wonderful stories , probably not true . Bi the telling of them was important . I was the youngest on my line , joke were made about that  --  what a woman could still hope for from someor my age . Jokes were important . The line was a complex society with standards of conduct honor seriot moral judgment . You did your work but did n't kiss ass , you stood up f ( yourself when you had to but did n't whine or complain , you kept your ey1 open and your mouth shut , you did n't make outlandish claims bra threaten . Yet none of this was visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nameless faceless surge of men in soft caps in full flight . Clara and I lived on Railroad , the street of the endless two-fami bungalows . I had my choice  --  to take the streetcar , which was faster , walk and save the carfare . I ran . I stopped only long enough to pick up a movie magazine or Try , Confessions , I liked to bring her small surprises keep her busy keep hf occupied . Sometimes I 'd find her waiting at the window looking out the windo ' ? the dark industrial sky , the great bobbing crowd of men flowing dow Railroad Street making a whispering sound on the cobblestones like sour dry Midwestern sea  --  and she 'd he holding her arms , the bleak mass Iii
