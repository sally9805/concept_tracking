CAT PEOPLE <P> Directed by Paul Schroder <P> Screenplay by Alan Ormsby <P> Paul Schrader is the kind of director who leaves no bra unhooked , no limb untorn from its socket in his pursuit of what he believes to be the true and terrible image . Cat People is clearly the work of a solemn literalist ( and a man with a taste for perverse ritual ) , not that of a cynic or a sensationalist . But motive makes small difference in the end result . The film best serves the values of the dimmest lurker in the deepest shadows of the grind house : it has lots of nudity , plenty of gross-out guts and gore , two or three scares-and it makes no sense whatsoever . Anyone grownup enough to gain legal admission to the movie ( it is rated R ) will probably find himself either reduced to guffaws or wishing he had stayed home looking at his poster of Nastassia Kinski wearing a snake . <P> A few golden-agers may even find their minds drifting back to the original Cat People ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than knocked off . Perhaps the most sophisticated horror film of its decade , it begins by considering a condition that might have served Freud as a case study in sexual hysteria . A young woman named Irena believes that if she makes love she will turn into a leopard-whereupon a man falls obsessively , irresistibly in love with her . Thereafter , through the play of sound and shadow , Director Jacques Tourneur suggests that it might be a good idea to take her at her word . The film is very delicately spooky , the more so because no rational explanation for her lamentable condition is advanced , neither hide nor hair of a leopard is ever spotted , and certainly no scene in which woman literally turns into cat , or vice versa , is ever played . <P> All these are offered , unfortunately , in the new version , which stars Kinski , flat of voice , spirit and chest , as Irena . There is a fake anthropological prologue in which Hollywood 's tribe of all-purpose primitives is seen tethering its maidens rather uncomfortably close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heritage , lost in the mists of the backlot . And there is Malcolm McDowell , quite persuasively feline , as her brother . In his human form he is something of a tomcat , which , of course , means he keeps turning into a big cat , with unfortunate results for the ladies he stalks . He keeps proposing incest as the only safe and sane way for cat people to have a little fun in their lives . <P> But Irena is a nice girl . She would remain a virgin , if only she could forget about that nice zookeeper ( John Heard ) . If only he could forget about her-which should be easy , since the cheerful and lovely Annette O'Toole plays his first love . Soon Irena is switching back and forth between cat and human forms , though it must be said that her transformations are more fastidious than her brother 's , which feature much smoke and bile .
