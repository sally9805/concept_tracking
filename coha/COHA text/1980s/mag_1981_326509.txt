Thatcher backs jobs program <P> She is so closely identified with the program of austerity that her enemies have caustically dubbed it " Thatcherism " -a campaign to revive the economy and curb inflation by following a stern policy of tight money and cutbacks in government spending . Even when the unemployment rate for young Britons rose to 34% and the demand for jobs became one of the causes of the riots in the major cities , she insisted that she would not compromise . But last week , as mobs still rioted in Liverpool on the eve of the royal wedding , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abruptly turned away from a key phase of Thatcherism . She went before the House of Commons to announce a $1.3 billion program aimed at providing more jobs and educational opportunities for the nation 's 900,000 unemployed youths . <P> The goal of the plan is to put 500,000 young people ( ages 16 and 17 ) either to work or in specialized instruction programs by 1983 . The government-financed on-the-job training will be expanded from 440,000 slots to 550,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to take vocational courses . To open up more jobs for young people , the program will beef up retirement benefits for elderly workers . To encourage firms to sign up teenagers , the government will pay $28 for every employee under 18 who earns $74 a week or less . The proposals were immediately dismissed by opposition Labor Party leaders as trying to " stem a flood tide with a sandbag . " <P> The new program was the result of the most acrimonious Cabinet debate of Thatcher 's two-year reign as Prime Minister . Says one minister : " Margaret came under very heavy fire , with raised voices around the table . " The attack was led by Tory moderates who argued for a much more sweeping proposal that would guarantee schooling , training or work for every 16-year-old . Cost : $2.3 billion a year . In the end , Deputy Prime Minister and Home Secretary William Whitelaw and Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington , the Cabinet heavyweights , backed the reduced plan , and Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe agreed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher 's tenure , the debate showed that the Cabinet could rebel against her if there is no economic improvement by next spring . Says one minister : " Things will never be quite the same after last Thursday . " A growing number of Conservative backbenchers fear that their constituents are fast losing patience with the sacrifices demanded by Thatcherism . Warned one Cabinet minister : " We must recapture the middle ground or suffer a whirlwind of discontent . "
