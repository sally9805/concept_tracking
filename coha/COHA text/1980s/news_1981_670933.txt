It was last spring , at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida . Mr. Morales was in the immigration line in a hastily assembled processing center at the base , having just arrived in the vanguard of the 124 , 789 refugees who came by boat from Cuba in 1980 . He remembers that the sun was as hot as the sun on the island he had come from and that he was thinking about the new life he was going to start at the age of 31. // " The man in front of me had murdered somebody on the street in Havana , " Mr. Morales recalled being told by the man ' s friends . Managing a smile at the imminent irony , he continued : " The officer asked him if he had ever been in jail . He said ' No . ' He was sent on . The officer asked me the same . I didn ' t want to begin in this country with a lie - I said ' Yes . ' You see where I am. " // Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 800 other refugees from last year ' s influx who are still being held by the immigration authorities because of alleged criminal records. // In a case that may affect them all , a Federal appeals court is to hear arguments on a contention by a compatriot of Mr. Morales , Pedro Rodriguez , that the Government has unlawfully detained him in Topeka , Kan. , without right of review . A number of other cases are in the lower courts. // The Immigration and Naturalization Service contends that these refugees are ineligible for admission to this country because they have records of felonies or crimes of " moral turpitude . " In Mr. Rodriguez ' s case , it was a record of theft and escape charges in Cuba. // Mr. Morales was first arrested as a teen-ager in Cuba and served three years in prison for evading the draft . Later , while working in a state factory making shoes for export , he was convicted of embezzlement ; he received a 10-year sentence and served eight. // " We were selling the shoes to friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , $50 , 000 worth , but everybody was doing it . I think they did a put-up job on me because of my trouble with the army . " <> <> Applied for Emigration // In 1979 Mr. Morales was free , working as a construction helper in Havana , with a wife and two children . Last April he heard of the possibility of emigrating and applied to the authorities . " I presented myself and they gave me the pass , " Mr. Morales said . " My family was not able to come. " // Under immigration law , convicted felons or those convicted of a crime of moral turpitude , such as prostitutes , embezzlers , petty thieves , can not be admitted to the United States and must be returned " to the country whence they came. " // But the Cuban prisoners , almost all of whom are being held at the maximum-security Atlanta Penitentiary , can not be deported because the Cuban authorities refuse to take them back ; in many cases those authorities forced former prisoners , mental patients , homosexuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Talks between the governments were broken off in January and have not resumed , pending a re-evaluation of Cuban policy by the Reagan Administration . <> <> Law Is Under Challenge // Meanwhile , the situation has produced intensive questioning of immigration law by attorneys representing the prisoners . In the past , courts have upheld the Government ' s position that it has virtually absolute power over people not yet granted admission to the United States , but the attorneys have sought and won some modifications in behalf of the Cubans , and civil liberties lawyers expect more. // For example , courts have affirmed the refugees ' right to a speedy hearing on detention and periodic review . Other matters under challenge by the refugees include previous rulings that such prisoners , since they are technically not in the United States , do not have ordinary constitutional rights . Many , like Mr. Morales , were incarcerated on their own admission , since the United States has no access to Cuba ' s criminal records . The prisoners ' right to summon and cross-examine witnesses at their exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them to show they are worthy of entering the country rather than on the Government to show they are not. // Even though most had completed their sentence in Cuba for the crimes allegedly committed , the law does not provide for their release. // In January , the Carter Administration proposed that a review panel be set up , similar to a parole board , that could have permitted the release of refugees no longer regarded as dangerous . However , the Reagan Administration is reviewing immigration policy and an interagency panel is preparing a report. // About 50 prisoners who had records of minor crimes or who were jailed by mistake have been released , and a source in the Bureau of Prisons said that 175 more would probably be eligible if the proposal for the review panel was revived . <> <> Problems at Fort Chaffee // While the refugee prisoners have their problems , 2 , 600 other refugees are still at the resettlement camp in Fort Chaffee , Ark . Almost all of them are young , single , black men with limited education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors for . And many have been in at least minor trouble with the law in Cuba ; the immigration authorities say that 16 , 170 of the Cuban refugees told them of involvement in minor crimes or acts that are considered crimes in Cuba but not in this country. // Several hundred are resettled throughout the United States in an average week and officials are now talking of being able to close the camp in June . More than 400 of the hard-to-place have been sent to halfway houses established by the National Catholic Conference . The Government pays about $2 , 000 to volunteer agencies such as the Catholic Conference for each resettlement , in addition to plane fare for the refugee. // Among those remaining at Fort Chaffee are 137 mentally retarded people and 330 people receiving psychiatric treatment . ( There are also 59 people classified as violent mental cases being held at St. Elizabeth ' s Hospital in Washington . ) The Government has been trying to contract with public or private institutions to remove them from the camp . <> <> Forced to Cut Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said treatment had been complicated by an undue reliance on drugs instead of therapy in Cuba . He also said a number of patients had said in interviews that during sugar harvests in Cuba they had been trucked to the fields to cut cane and that they had been given stimulants to get them working and tranquilizers to calm them at night. // There are also about 200 homosexuals among the Chaffee refugees awaiting placement . Most homosexual refugees have been resettled in Los Angeles and San Francisco , many through the efforts of the Metropolitan Community Church , which has a largely homosexual congregation . Robert M. Falls , the pastor of the church , said that sponsors had been found in the San Francisco area for 171 homosexuals . He said most were working and a few were doing well enough to move out on their own , but that two of the group were in jail for assault and 20 more were " people who have made no effort to help themselves - people who want to party all night and sleep all day. " // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence at Fort Chaffee . According to Mike Sweeney , a spokesman , the camp has been sending about a dozen refugees a week to the Atlanta Penitentiary because of involvement in the disturbances and in attacks on one another . " I guess the rights of the few have to be made subordinate to the rights of the many , " Mr. Sweeney said . " We just can ' t afford violence here. " // Attorneys representing the prisoners argue that such disciplinary transfers mean that the Cubans are , in effect , being tried and punished without Constitutional safeguards. // Among other refugees transferred to Atlanta recently was Mr. Rodriguez , the prisoner originally suing because of his detention in Topeka , Kan . <> <> ' In a Cage Like an Animal ' // At the 79-year-old Atlanta prison , which was made an all-Cuban facility at the turn of the year , the authorities have tried to establish recreation and work programs tailored to the Cubans , but they acknowledge that the size and sudden arrival of the group has made things difficult . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives and clubs are frequently found among the inmates. // " The treatment by the officers is very good , but we have had trouble among ourselves , " said Mr. Morales , a small man with a gentle voice . " When you lock a man up in a cage like an animal , he starts to act like one. " // Mr. Morales , who makes $7 a month working in the prison kitchen , has taught himself to read English , though he has found speaking the language is maddeningly difficult . He is resigned to returning to Cuba if that becomes possible , though he still hopes for release here. // " Maybe one day I ' ll be free , " he said . " That is what I came to this country for . " Mr. Morales is also a poet , writing tough-minded laments about the troubles that have come to him . This is an excerpt from " It ' s Raining , " his first poem in English : I seek in my memory A clear sky with the rumble of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her in my arms . But my memory fails In its lost search on the naked and cold Wall of this place Where only fear sings. //
