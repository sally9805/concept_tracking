Reagan cancels his stopover <P> The specter of the bruised and bloody body of Benigno Aquino would not go away . At every turn last week , Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos appeared to be moving through a tragedy of Shakespearean dimensions welling up from the assassination of his chief political rival . President Reagan canceled his plans to visit the Philippines , and the estranged Philippine business community was only reluctantly taking steps to help Marcos out of a gathering financial crisis , which last week led to a 21.4% devaluation of the peso . From a former U.S. Ambassador to both Iran and the Philippines , meanwhile , came a blunt warning that the struggle to replace Marcos could become a replay of the Iranian revolution . <P> Reagan 's decision to bypass the Philippines , along with Indonesia and Thailand , on his trip to Japan and South Korea due to begin Nov. 10 was a clear indication that the Administration would like to keep its distance . The White House cited a " particularly demanding " legislative calendar , but few officials were pretending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still pro-American , many of them were opposed to the trip on the grounds that it would show U.S. support for Marcos at a critical time . There was also a personal factor : Nancy Reagan firmly opposed the journey because of fears for her husband 's safety . For Marcos and his influential wife Imelda , the cancellation came as a blow , but most Filipinos were clearly delighted with Reagan 's decision . <P> In a syndicated newspaper article , William H. Sullivan , who was U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines from 1973 to 1977 and then Ambassador to Iran until April 1979 , wrote of " the parallels between the American dilemma in Manila today and our problems in Tehran in 1978 . " He warned of the " dangerous similarity " of U.S. ties in each case to " an authoritarian leader without a popular base of support . " In an interview with TIME , Sullivan said that the U.S. should encourage Marcos " to make an amicable deal with the moderate opposition in order to restore democracy , neutralize the small but growing ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Marcos spent much of last week soliciting support from reluctant Philippine businessmen , at one point reportedly threatening , " If things get messy around here and there is hyperinflation , you might see happening here what happened in Mexico and **25;6167;TOOLONG of the banks . " He did agree to add independent members to the six-man , pro-government commission investigating Aquino 's murder . But from his opponents the message remained the same , that Marcos should resign .
