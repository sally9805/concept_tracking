After five years , Khomeini still seems in full control of Iran 's revolution <P> Through the streets of Tehran they streamed , the wounded and the widowed , old men and young in the blood-red headbands of the suicide squads , a quarter of a million in all . " Death to America ! Death to Israel ! Death to France ! Death to Russia ! " they chanted in unison as Ahmed Khomeini , 35 , son of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , called for Islamic unity . Thunderous roars of approval arose as young victims of the war passed by on parade , swathed in bandages or seated in wheelchairs . Around them on every side , portraits of a glowering Khomeini stared down to discourage unholy thoughts and whip up further support . The grand finale of " The Ten Holy Nights , " February 's celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Islamic Republic , seemed to uncork a patriotic fever bordering on hysteria . " Iran is in a state of great excitement , " said a high Japanese official who recently visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy in Iran . " <P> Five years after Khomeini 's return from his Parisian exile to seize power in his homeland , his government of once inexperienced revolutionaries seems firmly in control . The ruling mullahs ( religious scholars ) and some 100,000 Islamic Guards who protect them have , to be sure , lost some of their popularity and remain saddled with myriad difficulties : the fitful 41-month war with archenemy Iraq , which continues to drain men and money ; a ruling class already decimated , and always threatened , by tenacious urban guerrillas ; 2 million refugees from the front and another 1.5 million from Afghanistan ; and the stigma of international isolation . But during a rare ten-day visit to the country , which has remained virtually closed to Americans since 1979 , a TIME reporter found that the Ayatullah 's regime has managed , for the moment , to weather these challenges with surprising agility . It has settled nearly all its international debts , signed up a steady stream of volunteers to the suicide-running Basij corps and , on paper at least , silenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing , " says an American who does business with Iran , " that they are doing as well as they are . " <P> Khomeini at 84 seems to be as unexpectedly resilient as his regime . Living off a strict regimen of boiled potatoes and raw vegetables , he is , say foreign visitors , rosy-cheeked and relatively healthy . His brother , Ayatullah Pasandideh , is still going strong in his late 90s . Though Khomeini has not been seen outside his closely guarded home in the old village of Jamaran for three years , he still oversees every political aspect of his country 's day-to-day affairs , while holding court each day before a host of visitors .
