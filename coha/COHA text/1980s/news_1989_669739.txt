It is his use of the power of the presidency to convey a moral message : in this case , that all illegal drug use is destructive , wrong , and intolerable. // Mr. Bush has gone far more public with this message than with any other since taking office. // Such messages can be crucial when they help create a moral climate . Past American epidemics of drug abuse - cocaine in the 1920s , opiates around the turn of the century - faded when middle-class attitudes turned sharply against them. // // ' ' The president focusing on it is very important , ' ' says James Hawdon , a sociologist at the University of Virginia who studies drug use . ' ' It adds an air of legitimacy , an air of urgency ' ' to social disapproval of illegal drugs. // Yet middle-class opinion has plainly already turned against the current wave of cocaine use . In large part , Bush is preaching to the already converted. // His message appears to be reaching the ranks of heavy crack smokers only dimly . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to grow in numbers and as a social problem. // Ed Gilmore , head deputy public defender for Los Angeles county , says of the average small-time crack user and dealer : // ' ' In a very general and superficial sense ' ' they are aware of Bush ' s war on drugs . ' ' But there ' s not a lot you can do for them . It ' s a tough group to educate. ' ' // In New York City , Chris Policano , director of public information for Phoenix House , a drug abuse treatment center , says of crack addicts : // ' ' They ' re not discussing the particulars of the Bush plan over coffee in the morning . But I do think they ' re going to feel it in the next few months. ' ' // In Jackson , Miss . , Youth Court counselor Claude McInnis says : // ' ' The people who are out there using these drugs do not see any TV news , they don ' t read any magazines , they don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s message , he says , ' ' It has no reality on the street. ' ' // In San Francisco , Alex Stalcup , medical director of drug detoxification at the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic , says : // ' ' I think there ' s almost nobody on the drug scene that isn ' t aware that this has been called a war . . . . My patients feel like the enemy. ' ' // In Miami , guidance counselor and teacher Frantz Jean-Louis at Miami Edison High School has seen both city action and the Bush initiative make a difference. // ' ' It seems to raise the consciousness , the moral awareness , ' ' he says . But he also adds that virtually all foreign-born students and probably two-thirds of the mostly black American-born students at Miami Edison already share Bush ' s view of drugs as a community concern. // The White House is giving the drug issue a full-court press . Bush followed his first nationally televised prime-time speech last week with a midday speech on Tuesday , also broadcast nationally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House estimates. // The speech to the schoolchildren was almost purely a moral appeal . He told them : ' ' Casual drug use is responsible for the casualties of the drug wars . From the city streets of America to the street bombings of Colombia , even dabblers in drugs bear responsibility for the blood being spilled . ' ' Like a concerned uncle , he exhorted them not to look the other way , but help drug abusers. // The moral appeal to the public is an important aspect of promoting a president ' s agenda for social change , says John Kessel , a political science professor at Ohio State University. // ' ' Regulation alone , where you are dealing with individual lifestyles , is not going to do it , ' ' he says , ' ' because the people whose lives are being regulated are going to resent or resist those rules unless they are given a reason for obeying them. ' ' // Dr. Kessel compares Bush ' s drug initiative to John Kennedy ' s initiatives for civil rights . Both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and the economy . They are issues that rise in importance when other things are going smoothly . Both battles have combined programs of laws and regulations with the symbolic politics of moral appeal . Both presidents , Kessel says , launched their efforts after the news media had already identified the problem as a national priority. // Both presidents did not so much change attitudes as give legitimacy to what people were seeing on television . In 1963 , the public was reacting to the police dogs and fire hoses used on demonstrators in the South . During the past two weeks , all three networks have aired specials on the drug problem and Time and Newsweek magazines each gave the issue cover stories. // The civil rights battle of the mid-1960s largely succeeded . Kennedy ' s impact was ' ' modest and very long run , ' ' Kessel says. // Bush has some added obstacles in his war on drugs . One is history . Presidents Johnson , Nixon , Carter , and Reagan each launched a war on drugs in his day . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights was amenable to national law , drugs are regulated mainly on the local level , and each local system - from police , to courts , to prisons - is separate. // ' ' It ' s not something the President has under his control , ' ' says Kessel . ' ' He can hope that by giving some kind of moral battle cry , he can mobilize all these levels and groups . Given past history in this , it ' s a high-risk effort. ' ' // Bruce Miroff , a State University of New York at Albany political scientist , compares Bush ' s current effort to Johnson ' s war on poverty . Both problems won the support of the middle class because it was prosperous enough to afford concern for problems of other people , and because it carried an undercurrent of fear of crime and upheaval among the urban poor , Dr. Miroff says. // Claude McIonis sees a middle-class double standard as well in Bush war on drugs . ' ' The politically weak are doing something illegal , and they ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Meanwhile , the middle class goes home to drink . . . and smoke its filtered cigarettes. ' ' // Chris Policano is sees it another way , as an end to a double-standard about the acceptability and glamour of cocaine : ' ' I think it ' s an effective use of the presidency . It ' s about time we straightened out these mixed messages. ' ' // //
