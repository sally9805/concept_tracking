neighbor 's house , and the brother had also eaten somewhere else . Breakfast was completely innocuous . It consisted of fruit juice , doughnuts and coffee . The children drank milk . Friday-night dinner was even less promising than the dinner on Satur  --  day night  --  fried fish and boiled pota  --  toes , bread and butter , and string beans , with the usual milk for the children . Dessert , as on the following night , was watermelon . " I 've seldom felt so stumped . Or , a moment later , so stupid . I was just about ready to call it quits when the obvious suddenly dawned . The chil  --  dren were sick . Mrs. Smith was sick . Her brother was sick . And so , apparently , was her father . But Smith himself was well . How come ? There was only one reasonable ex  --  planation . He had n't eaten something that all the others ate . I was right . I asked him and he told me . It was water  --  melon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it . I do n't know what I ex  --  pected , but I 'm sure it was n't that . I 'd never heard of wa  --  termelon as a vehicle for food poisoning . Nobody ever had . Nevertheless , it had to be considered . I asked Smith a few more questions and got a few more answers . They had bought the watermel  --  on  --  it was half a melon , ac  --  tually  --  at the supermarket in Milford , about five miles southeast of here , on Friday . There was some of it left . It was out in the refrigerator , if I wanted to take a look . I told him to keep it there . I 'd probably want to have it analyzed . " I got back home a little after four . I put the car away and went in the house and dropped my bag , and the doorbell rang . It was a woman I knew  --  Mrs. Brown , I 'll call her . She and her husband and their four young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother me on Sun  --  day , but it could n't be helped . It was mostly on account of the children . They had been sick and vomiting since nine or ten o'clock that morn  --  ing . And now they were violently diarrheic . So was she , but the chil  --  dren really concerned her . What did I think was the matter ? I let that go for a moment . 1 had some questions of my own that I wanted answered first . She had n't mentioned her husband . Did that mean he was n't sick ? No , she said . Or , rather , yes  --  he was fine . I began to get a rather creepy feeling . Had they by any chance eaten any watermelon recently ? She gave me a very odd look . Why , yes ; they 'd had watermelon for dinner only last night . I wondered if it might have come from the supermarket at Milford . It did  --  yes . That 's where they always traded . And they had all eaten some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not her husband . He did n't like watermelon . Neither did she , particularly . They had really bought it mainly for the children . I picked up my bag and opened the door and followed her out of the house . " The first thing Monday morning , I put in a call to the Milford super  --  market . I identified myself to the manager , and told him I had an out  --  break of food poisoning on my hands that was tentatively traced to water  --  melon bought at his store within the past two or three days . Until the mat  --  ter was settled , I 'd be much obliged if he would withhold all watermelon still in stock for sale . All things con  --  sidered , he took it very well . He did n't try to argue . He stuttered and stammered a little , but that was large  --  ly from shock  --  or maybe just plain disbelief . If so , I could hardly blame him . I did n't entirely believe it my  --  self . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food poisoningstill seemed a trifle far-fetched . There was reason to suspect it , but the evidence was purely circumstantial , and it was based on just two sets of circumstances . It could be a mere co  --  incidence . I do n't mean I really thought so , but it was possible to wonder . It was possible on Monday morning . By Monday afternoon , however , it was wholly out of the question . Two things accounted for the change . One was that I saw the Edison family again . I was called back there around noon . The kaolin had n't seemed to help . They were all still miserably diarrheic . In view of what I now suspected , that was n't too surprising . An attack of sal  --  monellosis can hang on for four or five days . In fact , I 've known of cases where the symptoms kept recurring for weeks , and even months . I did what I could  --  what I 'd done for the others . I pre  --  scribed another adsorbent , and a regimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of food again . With a little prompting , their memory re  --  vived  --  enough to recall that on Thursday night they 'd had watermelon for dessert . It was all gone now  --  they had only bought a slice . But , yes , it had come from the supermarket at Milford . Then came another out  --  break  --  a young couple I 'll call Miller . The Millers had been sick since Sunday with cramps , vomiting and diarrhea . Mrs. Miller had a temperature of 102 . On Saturday night , they had entertained another couple at dinner . Dessert was a slice of watermelon , from the Mil  --  ford supermarket . There was some of it left in the refrigerator . Their guests , as it happened , had n't eaten any . I took down the name of their friends , and when I got back to the office I gave them a ring . The wife answered the phone . Her husband was at work  --  and quite well . So was she . " Well , that was the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the picture . It was also clear that I had gone as far as I could alone . The rest was up to the state Department of Public Health . Food poisoning is a reportable disease in Massachusetts . I filled out a notification form and sent it off to the health officer for this district , in Worcester , " ? ? ? The district health officer to whom Dr. McKernan addressed his report was a physician named Gilbert E. Gayler . It reached Dr. Gayler on Tuesday . The following morning , he drove down to Upton for a prelimi  --  nary survey of the outbreak . He first conferred with Dr. McKernan . There were now , he learned , not four but five stricken families . The fifth was an elderly couple named ( I 'll say ) Green . They had shared a slice of watermelon from the Milford super  --  market on Friday night , they had be  --  come ill on Saturday and on Tues  --  day , after nearly four days of misery , they had summoned Dr. McKernan . The Greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final total , as it turned out  --  of 17 . Dr. Gayler spent the rest of the morning on a round of clini  --  cal calls . Accompanied by Dr. McKernan , he visited the Greens , the Smiths and the Millers and left with each of the several patients an enteric-specimen kit . The pa  --  tients were instructed to mail the kits as soon as possible to the diagnostic laboratory of the Massachusetts Depart ment of Public Health , in Boston . in addition , Dr. Gayler obtained from the Millers the remains of their Saturday-night watermelon . His next stop , after a hurried lunch with Dr. McKernan , was the supermarket at Milford . He inter  --  viewed the manager , the assistant manager and three clerks assigned to the fruit-and-vegetable department . All five were in their normal state of health . None were , or recently had been , afflicted with any sort of skin , respiratory or gastrointestinal trou  --  ble . An examination of the fruit-and  --  vegetable department indicated that it was , if anything , better kept and cleaner than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKer  --  nan , the store 's stock of watermel  --  ons  --  both whole and sliced  --  had been withdrawn from sale , but all the cut melons were still meticulously wrapped in cellophane , as they had been all along . Dr. Gayler took one of the slices with him to be analyzed along with the Miller sample . He then returned to his car and headed for Boston and the diagnostic laboratory . Dr. Robert A. MacCready , the di  --  rector in charge , was not at the laboratory that afternoon when Dr. Gayler turned up with his samples of melon . He was attending a confer  --  ence at the statehouse . Not until his return the next day did he learn of the visit and its purpose . He heard the news from his senior bacteriologist , Mrs. Marion B. Holmes , and he heard it with incredulity . " I had no opinion of Dr. McKer  --  nan , " Dr. MacCready says . " I did n't know him . I did know Dr. Gayler , though . I knew him well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ble man . That 's about all that kept me from scoffing at Dr. McKernan 's hunch . There are innumerable vehi  --  cles of salmonella infection . The literature is full of outbreaks spread by almost any food you can name  --  meat , poultry , fish , eggs , milk , cheese , salads , pastries . Almost any food , that is , except fresh fruit . The incidence of salmonella in fresh fruit is so rare as to be almost negligible . Especially watermelon ! That thick hide ! The notion was almost whimsi  --  cal . Mrs. Holmes thought so , too . Or rather , she did at first . But now , after thinking it over , she was n't entirely sure . She did n't attempt to explain just how a watermelon might come to harbor a colony of salmonellae . She simply pointed out that watermelon is rich in sugar and moisture . It could thus serve the organism very nicely as a medium for growth and prolifera  --  tion . Which , of course , was perfectly true . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my opinion , however , it still seemed quite unlikely . The inside of a whole watermelon is presumably sterile , and the cut melons had been carefully wrapped by clerks who were all in good health . I 'd believe the implica tion when I saw some proof  --  when and if the laboratory could demon strate the presence of salmonella in those melons . The procedure in volved in such a test is a standard one . Specimens of the suspected material are planted in certain culture mediums that especially favor the growth of salmonella . Then nature takes its course . The results , if any , can usually be obtained in two or three days . This was Thursday . We should have an answer by Saturday or Sunday . Meanwhile , there was nothing to do but wait . " The only trouble was I did n't feel like just waiting . It was n't impatience . I got over that long ago . It was simple curiosity . I was in trigued . Watermelon or no watermelon , it was a most unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about it than Mrs. Holmes had learned from Dr. Gayler . That meant a trip to the scene . I made the necessary arrangements that afternoon and drove down on Friday morning . For company , among other reasons , I took along a colleague ? Joseph P. Rear don . He was , and is , the epidemiolo gist in the department 's Division of Communicable Diseases . As it turned out , Dr. Reardon more than paid his way . Our first stop was Dr. McKer nan 's office . Dr. Gayler joined us there . They gave us a full report . Dr. Gayler 's contribution was a poll of the other doctors in the Milford area . I do n't remember just how many he called , and it does n't matter . The re sponses were all the same . None of the doctors had seen a case of acute gastroenteritis in the past ten days or two weeks . So the outbreak was con fined to Upton . Before moving on to Milford , we had a look at some of the patients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations and we did n't find any . We did pick up an continued on page 102 A few days before Christmas there was a soft snow . That and the season set us boys to making snow angels . You lie flat , arms at your sides , feet together . Slowly you open your legs and bring your arms up over your head . If you get up very carefully , there is an angel in the snow . If there is a hard freeze  --  and there usually is at this time of year in Vermont  --  your angel will stay several days . It fools the grownups . They think there were real angels  --  or so they told us . But today you could n't tell the younger girl cousin anything . She had just learned that there was n't any Santa Claus . We had known it for a long time , of course  --  al  --  though I 'd still sneak a Christ  --  mas-morning glance for reindeer tracks on the snow-covered lawn . The younger girl cousin was miserable . The elder girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . So , when the younger one began to cry , who should appear , home from his day at the quarry with his two great dun oxen , but Pat O'Rourke . Pat scooped her up and she rubbed her eyes and little nose against his marble-smellingjacket . Pat had a great gentle hand with a sick beast or an unhappy child . He said , " There now ; I see the angels has been here ! " And when the younger cousin sniffled , " There were n't any angels ; it was just the boys ! " he said , " Well , they could n't be made better if the angels them  --  selves was in it . " " There are n't any angels  --  no more than there 's any Santa Claus ! " Pat seemed to take in the situa  --  tion instantly . " Why , for Santy Claus I would n't be positive . But angels , now  --  sure how would the boys know to make angels if there was n't any angels ? " The little girl seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 thought there might be holes in Pat 's logic , though I did n't see exactly where . Any  --  how , I preferred angels to logic , and seeing Pat bed down his oxen to either . Ed drove the off ox , Robert Emmet , and I drove the nigh one , Finn MacCool . The elder girl cousin cried " Gee " and " Haw " ? as if she were doing something  --  and between us we got the yoke safely the hundred yards to Pat 's shed . We boys scrambled into the loft andforked down summer-smelling hay . The younger girl wiped her eyes on the barn cat . And sud  --  denly there was Pat 's plump wife , Katie , cuddling her and saying that at Pat 's age he ought to have better sense . Most what Katie O'Rourke said started with people oughting to have better sense at their age and wound up with green tea and cookies . We had our outer clothes yanked off and hung to dry by the stove in Katie 's tiny , scrubbed kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being exactly in front of her at the stove or sink or wherever Katie might be working at the moment . Katie was making things fly , and I judged her Irish was up . She even turned on the younger girl . " No angels ? At your age you ought to have better sense ! You go sit on my man 's lap  --  and you , Pat O'Rourke , you tell her the way she 'll know ! Foolish in the head you may be , but you 've the gift of gab , and this is no time of year for children , or any  --  body else , to be doubting the glory that shines around . . .
