By the time the first volume of Henry Kissinger 's memoirs , White House Years , appeared in October 1979 , readers of TIME had already been given an extraordinary preview of its contents : three major excerpts from the book , selected and condensed by our editors in consultation with Kissinger . TIME 'S readers once again have a first look at Kissinger 's remarkable world in this week 's cover story , the first of three installments from his forthcoming book , Years of Upheaval , to be published on March 25 by Little , Brown . This volume covers Kissinger 's service as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State during Richard Nixon 's second term . TIME 'S excerpts will focus on the 1973 war in the Middle East , Watergate and Kissinger 's dealings with the Soviets and Chinese . <P> As in 1979 , the daunting task of editing Kissinger 's insightful and often elegant prose went to Assistant Managing Editor Ronald Kriss . " For every Kissinger word we used , we had to discard 19 , " laments Kriss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material by subject , as we chose to do , is particularly difficult . " Completed excerpts were sent by courier to Kissinger , who would then telephone Kriss with comments and clarifications . " He is an excellent text editor , " says Kriss . " He is also an absolute workhorse . With help from TIME 'S switchboard , he was able to find me just about anywhere , at any hour , even in the shower at 8:30 a.m . " Kissinger also called several times from Massachusetts General Hospital , where he went first for tests and then , two weeks ago , for a triple coronary bypass . Says Kriss : " The very night before his surgery , with attendants swarming around to prep him , he calmly went over a 15,000-word segment with me-and he did n't miss so much as a dropped comma . " Indeed , from his hospital bed Kissinger is still putting the final touches on TIME 'S next two installments . <P> At least for a while , Kriss had more hospitable surroundings for his work : the Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on the Kissinger manuscript . <P> Reporter-Researcher Eileen Chiu , who double-checked everything in TIME 'S excerpts that could be independently verified , was also vacationing in St. Maarten , with her husband and 20-month-old daughter . " We all had dinner together and spent a lot of time talking about how we would handle the material , " says Chiu . So , via the Netherlands Antilles , Boston and New York City , TIME can offer its readers a richly detailed account of a most controversial period of American history from one of its principal participants .
