The tumbledown house on Van Dyke Avenue on Detroit 's gritty East Side looks as if it fell from the sky . Actually , it collapsed after scavengers pried the bricks out from the foundation . Armed with wagons , shopping carts , wheelbarrows and pickup trucks , vandals have descended upon the city 's empty buildings . In some cases , they have hauled away entire walls and porches , brick by brick . These thefts are a new wrinkle in free-lance demolition on the East Side , which has also experienced a plague of aluminum-siding rip-offs . <P> The scavengers sell their booty to scrap dealers . While new red bricks cost about $450 per 1,000 on the retail market , dealers pay the thieves only $50 . Since Detroit tears down 2,000 to 3,000 abandoned buildings a year , police are not terribly concerned about the thefts . The most troubling aspect of this new inner-city crime wave is the motive of most of the culprits : to get enough cash for another hit of crack . " Brick stealing is on the upswing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick , " says Charles H. Smith Jr. , president of the Oakman Boulevard Community Association . " Crackheads will steal anything , and there 's a market for them because somebody 's buying . "
