p 300 the springtime , when the magnolias and azaleas were blooming . As the sun began to drop over the coast Jean Lafitte had sailed some seventy years earlier , he ambled back to the main section , admiring the city 's Custom House , its solidlooking theater , its Cotton Exchange . Across from the last , he saw a clean-looking saloon whose gaudy sign announced it as the Sam Houston Rest . He fished in his pocket , counted his money , realized he was hungry , and with his bedroll over his shoulder and his second-hand Montana peak hat shading his face , crossed the dusty street and pushed through the saloon doors . It was his first mistake . The place was popular , and noisy . Seamen and stevedores lined the bar . Carter had finished a tough piece of steak and was mopping up the gravy with a slab of bread when a round-faced stranger in a derby approached his table . The man had bland brown eyes , a stubby nose , and a short beard fringing his chin . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter guessed . " You look like a stranger in Galveston , " the man said with soft Southern speech and a friendly smile . Wary , Carter returned his bread to his plate . " You 're right . " " Mighty nice town . Mighty nice weather most of the year . About one more month and we 'll see the end of hurricane season . Then we 'll rest a lot easier . " The man took off his derby and offered an apologetic smile . " Do n't mean to intrude . It 's just that the barkeep pointed you out as a newcomer and my brother-in-law , he 's lookin ' to hire a young man like you . " The man 's apology reassured Carter . He relaxed and prepared to finish his bread and gravy . But first he said , " To do what ? " " Porter in a boarding house . Out on the edge of town . " A porter ? Carter rebelled at the idea . There should be better work available . Of course no work was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He supposed it would n't hurt to explore this opportunity ; maybe even take  | the job for a few days . That would give him time to look for something better . His distrust of the stranger was quickly disappearing . The man was holding his derby in his hands , and with those round cheeks and that fringe of beard , he looked like a slightly overweight saint . " I might be interested in talking to your brother-in-law , " Carter said . To make sure the man knew who was in charge , he added , " As soon as I finish my meal and my beer . Meantime , why do n't you sit down ? " " Thanks kindly . " The man bobbed his head , took a chair and held out his hand . " Name 's Olaf . James Olaf . I 'm a Kentucky Scotsman on my mother 's side , and immigrant Swede on my father 's . Care for a cigar ? " Carter pushed his plate away and hesitated only a moment . A cigar would taste fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent to the match Olaf extended , then leaned back in his chair and introduced himself . The meal had been his first solid one in a couple of days . He 'd eaten so fast , he felt uncomfortable ; a little dizzy . The cigar seemed to enhance the feeling . But he was so used to being tired and light-headed from lack of food and exposure to the elements , he did n't think much about it . Sunshine slanted through a dusty window a few feet away . A ship 's horn sounded in the harbor . Gulls cried in the fading autumn day . A sad season . A lonesome season . But they were all lonesome when you were wandering far from home . " Shall we go ? " Olaf asked presently , a touch of impatience in his voice . A little glassy-eyed , Carter leaned back . " I 'll be ready soon . " " Yes , of course , did n't mean to rush you , " Olaf murmured . Carter tilted his stein and drained it , thus missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He should have been warned by the men loitering on the steps of the boarding house that sat on the Gulf side of the  | island , just outside of town . It was a large place  --  three stories  --  built on rotting pilings sunk in the sand . There was a palmetto thicket to the west , but no vegetation around the house itself except for a couple of patches of sea oats bending in the sunset breeze . Several miles out on the white capped Gulf , a side-wheeler spewed black smoke from its funnels as it plowed in the direction of New Orleans . Carter 's attention was focused on the two men , emaciated and dirty , who were lounging on the steps . One had a ring in his ear  --  an unpleasant reminder of Ortega . The other was whittling . Carter could n't bring himself to look at the knife . He knew both men looked shady , yet at the same time he did n't care . He was still pleasantly tipsy from the beer  --  unusual for just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't as cautious as he should have been . " Come on in , " Olaf said , a comradely arm across Carter 's shoulder ; yet there was pressure in Olaf 's hand , as if he were hurrying Carter past the loungers . One said something Carter could n't hear . The other snickered . Inside , there was little light , and a heavy smell of cigar smoke and beer . In a minuscule room to the right of the frowsy entrance hall , Carter saw two more roughnecks leaning on a bar made of a plank and two ship 's kegs . In a chair in a corner sat a yellow-haired girl in a chemise . Skinny , yet touchingly pretty . Twenty or so , Carter figured , smiling at her . She smiled in return , smoothing the front of her chemise so that her small breasts stood out . " We like to make our boarders comfortable , " Olaf said with an understanding chuckle . " Seamen expect certain amenities any place they stay ? " He had led Carter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to a kitchen . A heavy black woman was frying potatoes at an iron stove . " Horace here ? " " Gone to Houston overnight , Mist ' Olaf . Business . Your sister went too . " Olaf looked upset . " Horace did n't tell me he 'd be away . " " Came up sudden like . " " Yes , but I brought this young man here to talk about the porter 's job . " The black woman studied Carter through the smoke rising from her skillet . Quickly she lifted the pan from the stove top and cooled it , hissing , in a bucket of water . " Mist ' Horace say he be back on the first morning ferry . We ai n't  | full tonight . The young gen'man could have a bed , I ! ' spose . " " Capital idea , " Olaf said , beaming . " We 'll even give him a drink on the house . Thank you , Maum Charlene , " he added with great politeness . In the makeshift barroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant cousin of Horace 's , from up San Antonio way . Her name was Lu Ann . " You 're welcome to I chat with her , Mr. Kent , but I 'm afraid the largesse of the house does n't include her favors . Any arrangement you make with her is strictly a cash transaction . " Carter nodded blearily , still feeling the effect of the beer . " Fair enough , " he mumbled . Olaf poured him a drink of surprisingly good bourbon , and left . He sat down and began to chat with Lu Ann . She offered him another cigar , and after a few puffs he grew foggier still  --  drunkenly dizzy  --  and before long found himself , toasting the little yellow-haired whore : " To you , Miss Lu Ann . The most beautiful girl in Texas . The world , maybe . " She laughed , showing bad teeth . " My , my , Mr. Kent . You have a charming way to talkin ' , indeed you do . " " You inspire it , ma'am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't let down so completely , yet too tired and drunk to care . " I do believe I 've fallen in love with you . " In his state , it was almost true . She reached out , dropped her hand between his legs and began to stroke slowly : " I declare , Mr. Kent  --  you just take a girl 's breath away . I ' spose we could do somethin ' about the way you feel , though I hate to bring up such a thing as the price of our enjoyin ' ourselves in my room . " He told her he still had two dollars . It was enough . He finished the cigar , which he had decided smelled curiously sweet  --  or was that Miss Lu Ann 's scent ? He followed her up to her quarters  --  the door had a tin numeral on it  --  where she disposed of her chemise , and he was soon floundering on top of her . Of the rest he remembered very little . In the middle of the night he rolled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a lot of silly words about her beauty , and when it was finished , he slept long and hard . He roused in response to someone shaking him .  | " Lu Ann ? " he mumbled , his eyes not yet open . " Wake up , " said a familiar voice . " Wake up and pay your bill . " Carter sat up and reached for his drawers , befuddled by the sight of James Olaf with a marlin spike stuck in his belt , a piece of paper in his hand , and a decidedly ugly expression on his face . " Pay ? ? " Carter repeated . Olaf thrust the paper at him . " Four hundred and six dollars . " He did n't think he 'd heard correctly . " For what ? " " Read , for Christ 's sake ! " Olaf shook the paper . Sure enough , there it was  --  itemized . Lodging . Liquor . Extra . The extra amounted to a hundred and fifty dollars . Dumbfounded , Carter pointed to the last item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean you forgot little Miss Lu Ann already ? " For the first time , he realized she was gone . " She told me  --  she told me it cost two dollars ! " Another laugh ; harsh this time . " What the hell does she know ? She 's only been here a week . The customers pay me . " Carter raked fingers through his hair as he peered at the bill , noting that it was soiled and wrinkled , as if it had been used many times . There was no name at the top , merely a notation . Charges , Room 6 . The tin numeral on the open door was 6 , he saw . " Where 's the girl ? ? " he began . " She does n't want to talk to you . " " But I thought ? " " That she liked you ? She does what she 's told , friend . " " Let me speak to the man who runs this place . Your brother-in-law . " " Horace ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " Carter began to realize how stupidly he 'd behaved . Hunger , tiredness , and the need for a little companionship had  | lulled him out of his usual wariness . In his hand he held the result . He thought of the girl , and of his foolish babbling . How she must be laughing . She 'd put one over on him . Put one , over on the glib Mr. Carter Kent , who always fancied himself in charge of things . Somehow , being gulled by the little : yellow-haired whore was worse than being cheated by q this  --  this He could n't finish . He did n't know the word he wanted . What was this place ? The answer came suddenly from the past ; from his memories of the docks of Boston : " This is a damn crimping operation . You 're all in cahoots . " " Smart boy for a Yankee , " Olaf said with a chilly smile . , " Guess you 're quick enough to figure what comes next , then . A choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fair and lawful charges , or you can sign on as an ordinary seaman on the Gulf Empress , leaving day after tomorrow . " " For where ? " " Liverpool , Marseilles  --  you 'll only be gone half a year or thereabouts . Do n't think you can go to the law about this . They 're friends of mine . " Carter shivered under the coverlet he was still clutching " against his middle . He thought he heard someone tread on a board in the hall . Had the crimp brought help , just in j case ? He eyed the room . No windows , but he seemed to recall one in the corridor . Desperate , he knew he had to choose 1 an option he detested . " All right , " he said , feigning defeat . " Guess I do n't want to go to jail . " " You Yankees have some brains after all , " Olaf chortled , weaving the paper . " Pull your britches on . Maum Charlene wl will feed you a plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master of the Empress . " Carter nodded , rubbed his stubbled jaw , lurched from bed , and got dressed . Just as he was buttoning up his denim pants , Olaf turned and stepped through the door to say something to whoever was waiting outside . Seeing his chance , Carter lunged and hit him in the back .  | JAMES OLAF WAS HURLED across the hall so violently , his chin tore a hole in the flimsy wall . He hung there a second or so , his right hand clawing for the spike in his belt . " Help , help up here ! " he bellowed . A man leaped at Carter from the left ; one of the loungers he 'd seen on the front steps the night before . Carter ducked as the man hacked the air with his whittling knife . Suddenly he smelled fish . His stomach ached so badly , he wanted to double over . The knife shaved past Carter 's left arm . He drove two hard but clumsy punches into the man 's midsection . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a landing where the stairs went down to the left . At the far side of the landing was the window Carter remembered . Beyond it , calm water glittered in the morning sun . Terror drying his mouth , he charged the staggering man and hit him with his shoulder , driving him toward the glass . The man realized he was falling , and fought for balance . That gave Carter a chance to rush in beneath the man 's knife hand , seize his old blue seaman 's shirt and fling him sideways down the stairs . Halfway to the bottom , he crashed into the black woman , Maum Charlene , who was coming up with a shotgun in her big hands . Arms and legs flew , the gun discharged , and shot punched scores of small holes in the ceiling directly over the stairs . Carter had other things on his mind  --  chiefly Olaf , who was running toward him full tilt , swinging the marlin spike in a murderous arc . Carter backed toward the window but miscalculated the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It  | gave way . He flung his arm over his face and tumbled through with a strangled oath . Because of his fall , the spike missed his face by three inches , burying its tip in the dow frame instead . Amid a shower of glass , he rolled down the sloping roof below the window . The roof saved him from a serious injury ; when he tumbled off the eave , he fell only six feet to the sand . He fought to get his wind back as he scram-bled to his feet . He ran toward Galveston in fear of his , life . When he reached the center of Galveston with no sign of pursuit , he calmed down and tried to reassure himself that the incident was over . He 'd hear no more from Olaf  --  the man was obviously a crook , and could n't afford to draw ; attention to his crimping operation . He was famished . But he had no money for a meal ; his trousers had been searched while he slept in Lu Ann 's bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind so he had nothing to sell , either . He 'd have to steal the price of the ferry to the mainland , or sneak aboard . But that could wait until he filled his growling belly . That decision was his second mistake . Carter was foraging for food in the garbage cans of 4 ' large hotel when two uniformed men suddenly appeared a the mouth of the alley , billy clubs in hand . " There he is ! " the taller policeman shouted , charging . ) , i Carter turned to run , bumped against one of the garbage barrels and overturned it . He slipped and fell in a slimy heap of cold meat fat , fruit rinds , coffee grounds  --  all of it stinking like hell . " Fits the description , " panted the other officer as the two raced up to him , clubs ready . This time Carter was in nd ? mood to fight . He lay there in the garbage , staring up at their coarse faces . The bigger officer leaned down and ? grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How  --  how 'd you find me ? " " Why , Jim Olaf came to see the captain  --  Jim 's got a loti of friends in town , y'understand . He described you and the '  | rest was easy . We just started lookin ' for a dark-haired , well set-up Yankee tramp . Your accent just filled in the last bit of identification . You 're a Yankee , all right . " " An ' he 's right where a Yankee belongs , " said the other , grinning even wider than his companion . " In the slops . " He drew his booted foot back and kicked Carter 's genitals . Carter screamed and clutched himself . After the fourth kick , he fainted . The magistrate was an avuncular man with white side whiskers . He identified himself as another friend of Jim Olaf 's . The crimp must have paid off half the damn town ! The charge was defrauding an innkeeper . Carter tried to speak in his own defense but was gaveled to silence . The magistrate sentenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of his jail term the fringe of a tropical storm brushed Galveston with heavy rains and howling winds , and Carter was glad to be indoors . The food was n't bad in jail , either . Each meal included greasy grits , but at least the plate and tin cup were shoved into his cell three times daily . Even so , he nearly went crazy in the confines of the six by ten foot cell with its plank sleeping platform , its bucket of tepid , bug-infested wash water , and its second , uncovered pail for his own wastes . The jailor was supposed to empty the waste pail once a day but he often forgot . Complaints were useless . A small , high window in the cell overlooked a side street that Carter often watched for hours by standing on the plank platform . Late one afternoon , he saw Olaf drive by in an expensive buggy , two finely dressed girls riding with him under parasols , chatting and laughing . One was the little yellow-haired trollop . Carter clutched the bars and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Galveston jail was an experience that scarred Carter , just as other brushes with violent death and deceitful people had scarred him . The cell was the most potent proof he 'd yet encountered that if you did n't run others , they 'd run you . He thought about the yellow-haired girl , and of how  | foolishly he 'd trusted her . Under the influence of beer and what surely must have been cigars impregnated with some kind of drug , he 'd even gotten sentimental over her . And while the girl was no one he really cared about , her deception humiliated him . He thought a lot about the Greek woman , too . In a way , he had also trusted Helen Stavros . He 'd trusted her beauty , her warm eyes , her smile  --  and they had deceived him . She , had meant for them to do that . Helen Stavros had made him suspicious of all women , and now the yellow-haired girl had confirmed and solidified that suspicion . 11 Women had their place , he supposed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for loving them ? trusting them  --  he had been suspicious of that before he came to Galveston , and now he knew he was right . As for trusting men  --  strangers such as Olaf who smiled and pretended to be decent , generous , helpful  --  well , the cell demonstrated where that got you . He concluded that the only people in the entire world it would be safe for him ; to trust were his mother , Will , and Gideon  --  none of whom he 'd ever see again , probably . Therefore he was alone in a world of Olafs and Lu Anns  --  a world of potential enemies . He 'd long suspected , it . Now he knew it . So if he did n't behave accordingly , he was a damn fool Which was exactly what he 'd been thus far in Galveston . Like the fearful lesson of the Red Cod , that was another he would n't soon forget . On the day he was released , a policeman escorted him to the ferry and paid his passage across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseasonably cold for , it Texas . A light drizzle was falling . The policeman turned ups , the collar of his old overcoat and said : " On your way , now . Do n't let us see you in Galveston again , boy . " " You wo n't . " " Where you headin ' ? North ? " Carter had n't the slightest idea . He gazed out past they docked ferry and the rain-stippled Gulf to the coast ; a vast ;  | slate-colored flatland embracing Galveston Bay . Earth , water , and dark gray sky seemed to fuse into one immense and hostile waste in which he had no home , countless enemies , little future , and less hope . His spirits sank What good were the lessons he 'd learned ? What good was cleverness , ambition  --  anything ? lHe was alone and all that had happened to him in Galveston could well happen to him again , no matter how carefully he guarded against it . Then the unquenchable Kent optimism came to his aid . He brought his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't know where I 'm going , " he answered . " But you 'll hear from me one of these days , you can bet . Galveston 's going to feel bad about treating me the way it did . " He said it with such conviction , the officer could n't bring himself to laugh . Cocking his head , he asked : " That a threat or just a promise ? " Carter held up both hands . " Oh , a promise . Threats can get you killed . " Smiling that dazzling smile , Carter stepped onto the ferry and tried to ignore the rain , the freezing wind , the great empty vista of water , and forlorn sky in which he , of all human beings , had no place . But surely , in a land so vast , there should be a place for him . He 'd keep traveling in search of it , trusting no one . And he would n't stop unless they buried him . WILL 'S COLLISION WITH A fellow student on the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendship . Will soon discovered that Drew Hastings had a first-rate mind , an interest in medicine that was almost a passion ,  | and a desire to succeed that matched or-exceeded Will 's own . Drew 's ambition was due in large part to the dedication with which his mother and father had approached the task of educating him . His parents were storekeepers ; people of modest means , to whom the annual tuition of two hundred dollars plus incidental fees was an enormous sum . They had scrimped for years to accumulate the money . Drew was the sole recipient . He had a younger sister , Will learned , and he was devoted to her ; but his devotion ' did n't extend to a belief that she should receive higher education . The family could afford just one standard bearer . Drew , older , and male , was the clear choice . He made no secret of liking it that way . Each young man brought certain qualities to the friend- ' ship . Drew brought the steadiness and authority that went ' with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he could expound about medicine . He 'd read extensively before coming to Boston , and he knew some startling things . On one occasion he astonished Will by telling him ' 11 that Hippocrates , the famous Greek physician of the fifth ' century B.c. , probably had little to do with the body of medical writing known as the Hippocratic Collection . Some scholars said he had no connection with the famous oath ' bearing his name . Many skilled doctors had taught and written at the medical school on the island of Cos , Drew said . Hippocrates was among the most famous . He had also been born onI the island . So it was undoubtedly inevitable that his name would be ascribed to aphorisms and bits of advice actually ' authored by others . Drew 's favorite was , " Not only must , ' the physician be ready to do his duty , the patient , the attendants , and external circumstances must conduce the cure . " The first time Drew quoted the saying to Will , he wentL on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those , 1 ' people do n't have time to think about good health , let ' alone do something about it . All their energy goes into surviving . As to their circumstances  --  what could be more ; , ' conducive to sickness than a tenement ? The poor need doctors more than the rich do . Hippocrates knew that . " , Will did n't agree with Drew 's conclusions , but he was , fascinated by the breadth of his friend 's knowledge . Hence one of his contributions to the friendship was the devotion ' , '  | of a pupil eager to learn . On the other hand , at certain times during the first term , he turned out to be the teacher . The practice of medicine interested Drew , but not the preparation that was fundamental to it . He hated the scientific studies required of first-year students  --  general chemistry , physiology , materia medics . Only anatomy held any appeal . Because of his attitude , he was soon flirting with dismissal . Even when studying physiology under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend most of the eight-man laboratory sessions . Instead , he relied on Will 's notes , and Will 's good memory . On the night before a test , Will would drill him for hours on the periodic table or Latin terms they were expected to know . Drew would absorb just enough information to squeak by . There were two hundred and seventy-five students in the medical school , ninety-six of them-in the first class . They lived in a closed universe consisting of the school building , its various annexes and laboratories , the City Hospital and Massachusetts General , where demonstrations took place and charity patients were observed , and the rooms in which they did their studying . Since Charles Eliot 's inauguration as President of Harvard , the medical curriculum had undergone extensive revision and improvement . Courses were more complex and more difficult than they 'd been just a few years earlier . Will and Drew had to keep up with daily and weekly work , but they also faced comprehensive examinations in the spring ; examinations covering all the material studied during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn the right to advance to the next class . During his first term at the school , Will worked twelve , fourteen , sixteen hours a day  --  Sundays included . Sometimes the work load became so heavy , he existed for days in a state of near exhaustion . Once in a while he grew deeply discouraged . But when he did , he would recall standing in the rain outside the Vanderbilt mansion , or lunching with Vlandingham , or promising his stepbrother he 'd amount to something . Any of those memories , but especially the last one , was enough to overcome his discour'agement and keep him going without sleep and without complaint .  | Occasionally there was a short respite from the routine . One came in mid-November . Drew announced that his father would be arriving on Saturday , to check on his son 's progress . He 'd be staying overnight . Will was invited to join them for supper . To Will 's surprise  --  and Drew 's  --  another member of the family turned up , too . Drew 's younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family invited Will to eat at a Boston fish house not noted for low prices . Will had already heard that Mr. Hastings had been forced to it travel from Hartford in a borrowed farm wagon ; he could n't afford train fare . So Will insisted that he pay for supper , and made Drew 's agreement a condition of his acceptance of the invitation . Joab Hastings was a stout , soft-spoken man with rough skin and a red face . He was almost uncomfortably in awe of the two students , because they were venturing into intellectual realms wholly foreign to him . But leis pride in his son was obvious . Less impressed was Drew 's fifteen-year-old sister , Joanna , whom everyone called Jo . Her father said she 'd nagged him in such a cheerful but determined way , he 'd been forced to bring her along . His smile said it was n't an imposition , though . " She clerks at the family store , " he explained to Will . " She 's a hard worker . She deserved a little holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will concluded a few minutes later , when all of them were enjoying the first course  --  roasted oysters from a huge silver platter . Making conversation , he said : " Did you enjoy the ride up here , Miss Hastings ? " " I enjoyed the scenery . But I could n't help thinking how 11 it all might have been different . " " What do you mean ? " " If I were a boy , I could go to medical school . Since I 'm a girl , I have to settle for a trip . " Drew cracked a shell , then used his oyster knife to cut out the- small , tender nugget inside . He forked the oyster into a dish of hot melted butter . " You see , Will , five or six  | years ago , my little sister fell in love with the late Miss Nightingale . And with her profession . " " Calling , " Jo said as Drew ate the buttered oyster . " I 've told you a million times , Drew  --  Miss Nightingale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word has more spirituality than profession does . Do n't you agree , Mr. Kent ? " She fixed her blue-green eyes on him with a directness for which he was n't prepared . " Oh , certainly , Miss Hastings , " he said with a straight face , reaching for another oyster . He found the girl 's adolescent behavior by turns funny and annoying . She gave a vigorous nod . " I knew you 'd feel that way . " Drew laughed . She shot a wrathful glare in his direction . Will lifted his napkin to his mouth to hide a smile . He studied Jo covertly while they finished the oysters and awaited the chowder . Although she did n't share Drew 's stoutness , she could easily be recognized as his sister . Will found her attractive , though not in a conventional way . She was slim , and flat-chested . She had long , shining red-gold hair that gave off a pleasing smell of homemade soap . Her face was a well-proportioned oval , marred just a little by a nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was counterbalanced by a nicely shaped mouth . There was a light scattering of freckles on her cheeks . Unlike so many girls , she did n't bother to powder them into invisibility . They gave her face a touch of the tomboy that Will found charming . She was obviously bright , too . And quite conscious of the limits imposed on her by her sex . That was surely why most everything she said had an edge to it . Julia would have appreciated and encouraged her attitude , he supposed . Gently , Joab Hastings put his hand over hers . He said to Will , " Joanna would like to study at one of the Nightingale schools they 're starting here in the States . I 'm sure she 'd make a fine nurse . But there is n't enough profit in selling corn meal and pins to pay for two educations . " " So the world decrees it 's the girl who stays home , " Jo said . " The world and our circumstances , " Hastings agreed with a sad smile . Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day brothers and sisters will have an equal chance .  | Do you understand what I 'm saying , Mr. Kent ? I do n't want Drew not to study medicine . I just want the same opportunity . What do you think ? " " I think I have no business meddling into a family 's ? " " Oh , pooh ! " she cut in . " Answer the question . " Her father frowned . " You 're being impertinent , Joanna . " " I 'll answer , " Will said lightly . " I think your brother will need to support himself all through his life , while you 'll undoubtedly have a husband to look after you . So in theory , Drew needs more education than you . That may not be right , or fair . But for the time being it 's the way the world operates . " " I do n't care a fig for the way the world operates ! " she exclaimed . " Or for marriage , either . I have no intention of submitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiotic marital laws that prevail in this country . " " Joanna , " her father said , a little more sharply . She ignored him : " 1 have no intention of doing any of that merely to pay the bills ! " Will said to Drew , " Your sister should meet my stepmother . They 'd certainly see eye to eye . " To Jo : " My stepmother 's a suffragist . " " Young lady , I want you to settle down and mind your tongue , " Joab Hastings said , sounding severe for the first time . Jo glanced at her father , started to retort , then saw the set of his jaw . She looked at her lap . During the rest of the meal , Will found himself avoiding the girl 's eyes . They had taken on a strange intensity , and he seemed to be its object . For no reason that he could explain , the attention bothered him . His cheeks and neck were almost as pink as the lobsters they ate for the main course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner the two students escorted father and daughter back to the modest hotel where they 'd engaged two rooms . Will and Drew said goodnight  --  Jo shook Will 's hand for over ten seconds  --  then started walking down the dark , quiet street toward the river . " I hope Jo 's frankness did n't offend you , " Drew said . " We 're used to it around home . And to be fair , she really cares a lot about the family . Of course that does n't mean she approves of everything that goes on . Such as Ma spending her entire life doing whatever Pa asks . Trouble is , Jo 's  | protests hide all the kindness and love that are part of her , too . Strangers see the prickly exterior and think there 's nothing else . " My impression exactly , Will thought , though he would n't have said it . " Pa and I hope that prickly attitude will disappear as she gets older , " Drew continued . " Jo 's  --  uh  --  somewhat late to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kill me for saying so . But deep down , I think she craves a puffed-up figure . " " You 're probably right . Most girls these days want to look like Lillian Russell . " " I certainly hope she gets her wish . Maybe she 'll be less grumpy . " Will laughed . " Well , I was n't offended by anything she said . She 's a spirited young lady . " " She 's smitten with you , too . " " What ? " " Did n't you see her start making sheep 's eyes halfway through supper ? That was when she realized she liked you . " Will stopped under a street lamp , buttoning the collar of his overcoat against the night wind . With an awkward laugh , he fibbed , " No , I did n't notice any special looks . " " Then we 'd best rush you to City Hospital . You 've gone blind . " They resumed walking . " I 've seen a similar expression on my sister 's face once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was nine or ten . At thirteen it was the man who directs our church choir . She always seems to pick the brainy ones . She certainly got fooled this time , " he finished with a chuckle . Will ignored the joke . " I ca n't believe she 'd give two hoots about me . " Drew 's expression changed to one of puzzlement . Will 's words struck him as strangely abrupt and serious for a conversation essentially light in tone . He tried to preserve that lightness : " What 's the matter ? Do n't you think you 're good enough for my sister ? " Sometimes I do n't think I 'm good enough for anyone or anything . Again he kept the thought to himself . Drew continued in a jocular way , " Truth is , brother  | Kent , I do n't either . But we need n't worry about it . Adolescent girls have a crush a day , practically . They 're in love with being in love . She 'll grow out of it . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before Christmas , Drew arrived at the Kent house with a cylindrical object wrapped in brown paper . Grinning , he handed the package to Will . " It arrived this morning  --  along with a note asking me to give it to you with all due speed . I 'm to wish you a Merry Christmas in the bargain . " Will turned the package over and over . " Who 's it from ? " " My little sister . " " Jo ? " " I have only one little sister , as I recollect . Seems she 's still smitten . Unbelievable . Well , open it  --  open it ! " Will removed the paper and found an eighteen-inch-wide roll of fabric , which he carefully spread out on a table. - He caught his breath . On a dark blue background , in small , neat letters of white thread , Jo had reproduced a block of prose which began , I will look upon him who shall have taught me this Art even as one of my parents . " My Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every last word . Needlepoint , I think they call it . She made one for me , too . She must have done them at night . She works all day in the store . " - Will brushed his fingertips over the tiny letters . " It must have taken her hours and hours . It 's a beautiful present . I 'll write her right away and thank her . " Drew sat in a chair that creaked under him . " Do n't be too free with your compliments . She might turn up on your doorstep , pleading for a proposal . " " I doubt that . She said she hates the idea of marriage . " " And the idea of men dominating the world  --  and their wives . But those are merely ideas . You , on the other hand , are a living , breathing man . She can detest men in the abstract and dream about you and never see a smidgin of  | inconsistency . " A shrug . " She 's a young girl . That says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " He was touched by the gift . He thought of Jo 's blue-green eyes , and the freckles she did n't bother to hide . He thought of how she longed for a woman 's maturity , and that was funny , yet touching , too . She was a very engaging girl But one he must n't think about with any seriousness . There was no room in his plans for a girl who lacked social connections . That might be regrettable , but it was also the way things had to be . EVERY FEW WEEKS throughout the winter and spring of 1887 , Will received long letters from Drew 's sister . Usually the letters contained comments on happenings in Hartford or events on the national scene ; the comments were always made from the viewpoint of an avowed suffragist . Usually Jo 's ardor amused him . But there were unconsciously sad passages , too , as when she wrote about one wish that would remain forever unfulfilled ; a wish that she could travel to London and study at St. Thomas 's Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by subscription funds raised by Miss Nightingale herself . Jo took pains to emphasize that she did n't want to become a nurse in order to flaunt herself as an educated woman . She wanted to serve others , as Will and Drew would after they graduated . Her humanitarian impulses were as strong as her brother 's , Will soon realized . No wonder she 'd given him that particular Christmas gift . Will had framed the needlepoint and hung it on the wall of his room on Beacon Street . It quickly became as  | much a part of his life as the tea bottle or the Kentucky rifle downstairs . He had no time to write letters as lengthy as hers . Now and then he sent her a short note , but these became even less frequent as he settled down to study for the year-end examinations . He also tutored Drew . When they passed , ' they got drunk in a North End tavern to celebrate . Drew went home to Hartford for the summer , and Will spent almost every day in the deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program this second year was more to Drew 's liking . Even chemistry became tolerable against a background of courses in the clinical curriculum . Topographic and pathological anatomy . Clinical medicine . Clinical surgery . Their surgical studies consisted of lectures , observation in the operating theaters at Massachusetts General , and demonstrations in the basics of bandaging . The bandaging section met six days a week at eight in the morning . It was there Will finally realized how innately suited for the profession his friend was . Drew was the first pupil singled out by the faculty demonstrator , Assistant Professor Warren , to show that he 'd mastered the lessons taught so far . The patient was a young male charity case at City Hospital . The day before , he 'd had a small mole removed from his left shoulder blade by a student in the minor surgery class . Drew took off the old , stained bandage and put on a new one . He worked extremely slowly . But when he was done , the bandage was perfect . Warren pointed that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications of the good practitioner , " he said . " Patience . You will all have to develop that patience , whether it is innate in your character or not . You see , gentlemen , modern medicine is structured so as to make the following an immuta-ble law : if you are a practicing physician , you will of necessity be a practicing surgeon . The term surgeon is a very large umbrella . It covers many disciplines , and you must be expert in every one . Excellence , however , is far more than the sum of knowledge and a certain dexterity . ! flut permit me to quote the head of our department , Dr. Cheever . ' To be an excellent surgeon , it is not enough I ' !  | merely to be a competent operator . One must be a painstaker . ' Mr. Hastings is . " And he had superb hands , Will discovered . Pudgy with fat , almost feminine in their gentleness and grace , they nevertheless possessed great strength . One night a drunken fourth classman teased Drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door to his room in the dormitory . The upper classman kept calling Drew " ladyfingers " until Drew had enough of the bullying and laid him out cold with three fast punches . Will watched from the doorway ; he and Drew had been going over the day 's notes . Roosevelt all over again , Will thought . The comparison was accurate in other respects , too . They 'd had some discussions about a doctor 's responsibilities in which they 'd disagreed sharply . And sometimes Drew sounded uncomfortably like a nagging conscience . Drew dumped water on the upper classman , then helped him get up and limp away . Will 's compliment about the way Drew had thrown punches led the older student into some half-joking remarks about his hands , and his weight : " Know how I decided God must want me to be a doctor ? " First I realized I was fat as a tub . Next I found out I could do damn little about it . Still ca n't . Day after day , I eat nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never lose a pound . So these ? " He held out his hands . " ? these seem to be my only assets . It 's always struck me as smart to work with what you have . I mean ? what are the alternatives ? There 's really only one . You can refuse to make anything of what little you 've been given , but if you do that , you 're guaranteeing yourself a state of misery all your life . I 'd rather try to be useful . Ergo  --  in God 's grand if frequently murky plan , Hastings was meant to be a doctor . An obese one who will no doubt advise his patients to reduce their girth or face dire consequences . " Will 's amusement concealed a good deal of envy . He 'd never be as skillful as Drew and he already knew it . But he could follow Drew 's example and be a concerned , caring physician , a doctor who took to heart the words stitched into the dark blue fabric Jo had sent him . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The fall of ' 87 repeated the pattern of the preceding autumn . Will became more deeply immersed in his studies as the days went by , and less aware of events that stirred the collective mind and heart of the country . Gideon , of course , remained fully aware of those events . One such  --  and a major one  --  took place on the eleventh of November . In Chicago , four of the accused Haymarket conspirators  --  Albert Parsons , August Spies , Adolph Fischer , and George Engel  --  were hanged . A telegraphed account of the execution was delivered to Gideon 's office at Kent and Son late that day . He put everything aside to read the dispatch from the Union 's midwest correspondent . What he read filled him with dismay : " Oh my God , Miss Vail  --  listen to this . Just before the trap dropped out from under him , Fischer cried , Hoch die Anarchie ! ' Another of the four shouted in English , Hurrah for anarchy ! ' " He flung the dispatch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Haymarket set the cause of the working man back fifty years . " Helene Vail was seated at a desk which faced Gideon 's . From it , she could take his dictation or easily hand him a paper just pulled from her typewriting machine . The papers on her desk were neatly arranged , while those on his remained a jumble , despite her daily attention . Miss Vail was n't sympathetic to Gideon 's views on the Haymarket issue : " Which one of the traitors did that ? " " Engel . I remind you , Miss Vail  --  they were not proven guilty . That damn Chicago Daily News drove ' em to the gallows with its hue and cry for justice . " He lit a match and touched it to a fresh cigar . Miss Vail continued to look at him with disapproval . " Justice , " he repeated . " What a joke . There was no con- 11 ! elusive evidence , and all the judicial niceties of a kangaroo court in a mining camp  --  Judge Lynch presiding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  and counter to the views of a majority of people in this country . But by God , just because someone 's views are unpopular  --  or even downright repulsive  --  does n't mean they can be denied a  | fair trial . If anything , we have an obligation to be scrupulously fair with such people . Otherwise the right to dissent could be destroyed . " " That 's a subtlety I find hard to appreciate , Mr. Kent . " " You and a few million others . John Adams did n't fail to appreciate it . He served as the defense lawyer for the redcoats who caused the Boston Massacre in 1770 . It nearly cost him his livelihood , but he understood that someone had to defend ? " The clanging of the telephone bell interrupted . Miss Vail rose to answer . Gideon puffed his cigar . He felt tired . Thanks to the Union 's position on the trial of the Haymarket defendants , he was constantly on the defensive these days . White-faced , Miss Vail turned from the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from New York . " " Who 's it from ? " " Mr. Jesperson , the copy editor at the Union . " Gideon scowled . " Why the hell did n't he put it on the direct wire ? " " Please do n't keep cursing , Mr. Kent . I do n't know why . Perhaps he 's upset and confused . He says that Mr. Payne went for a noon walk along Park Row and on his way back , he was stricken with a heart seizure . He 's dead . " Theo Payne 's sudden passing brought sorrow and consternation to the Kent household . Gideon was greatly upset by the loss of a close friend and invaluable associate . Will traveled to New York with his father and stepmother to attend the funeral services . He returned to Boston alone ; Gideon and Julia moved into the suite at the Fifth Avenue Hotel , planning to stay until Gideon could find a new editor  --  no easy job . Miss Vail packed up and joined them . Saturday of the third week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a hired wagon heading for the New Hampshire border directly north of Lowell . He and Drew had left Boston two hours before daylight . They did n't reach their rendezvous point until five in the  | afternoon . By then Will was nearly frozen despite his overcoat , two sweaters , muffler , and gloves . Drew pulled the wagon into the shelter of some trees and scanned the autumn-withered landscape . A dirt road led into a large , barren grove just beyond a stone marker at the state line . The sky had the look of dark gray paint . " You still have n't told me who asked you to do this , " Will said . Drew rubbed his mittened hands together . " My answer 's the same as it was an hour ago , and two hours before that . It 's better you do n't know . " " You mean you ca n't tell your best friend where you got the money or directions to this godforsaken spot ? " " You can be assured it was n't from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical school obtains  --  uh , demonstration material . We would n't be out here freezing our glutei if the damned state legislators could decide once and for all whether the release of bodies was mandatory or discretionary . " Will knew that the current wording of the state law , last revised in 1859 , said unclaimed cadavers " may be " released to teaching institutions . It did not say " shall be . " At the moment , the Board of Health was not being cooperative . Hence expeditions such as this became necessary . Suddenly the cold air came alive with the creak of wheels and the plodding of hooves . Drew maneuvered their wagon out from behind the trees where they'd. been concealed . cealed . A second wagon had emerged from the grove be-yond the stone marker . Driven by a hunched-over man , the wagon was approaching along the road . Another man in a filthy coat and floppy hat rode a spavined horse out in l front of it . 1 ! i Presently the horseman reined in . He showed black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musket lay iY across his thighs . From the seat of the wagon , the driver simpered at Drew and Will . He was n't a normally propor- tioned man at all , but a poor , pitiable creature who looked barely competent to hold the reins . He had the body of an adult and a gigantic head with a strangely flattened and misshapen face . Slitted eyes were barely visible ben , path a drooping hat brim . " Brung you two of ' em , " the man on horseback said . Ci " But you ai n't the one who usually picks ' em up . "  | " He 's sick , " Drew said quickly . " That a fact . " A moment 's thought . " Mebbe I better tell you what I told him the first time he showed up here . If anybody ever comes to me and says I done this kind of business , I 'll find you and kill you . " His grin was hideous . " I know which school you 're buyin ' em ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't doubt for a minute that the man would do exactly as he promised if he were betrayed . The two students could not help staring at the pitiable thing on the wagon seat . Saliva trickled out one side of its mouth . It was male , but just barely recognizable as such , so distorted were the features . " You understand me , boy ? " the man on horseback said suddenly . Drew started . " Yes , of course . Completely . " " Good . Let 's get this over with . Price is fifty dollars apiece . You take ' em as is , wrapped up . " " But surely I get to inspect  --  " " Ai n't got time for no damn inspection , " the man broke in . His horse whinnied and shied . He looked over his shoulder . " They catch us at this , we 'll be prison-bound for sure . Now get your fat ass over here and unload ' em , so I can hightail . " " Come on , Will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could step down off the spokes of the front wheel . While Will was climbing down , Drew paid the man in gold . The poor creature in the wagon was delighted by the glint of the gold pieces , and began to giggle and finger his drooling lips . The two students hurried to the back of the wagon . They dragged the first canvas-wrapped body from under a concealing layer of straw . Will distinctly felt a lifeless arm and a head as he and Drew carried the corpse to their wagon . Then they loaded the second one , and covered both with burlap and scrap lumber they 'd brought along . The mounted man used his hat to slap the cheek of the witless man-child . After several false starts , the creature got the wagon turned and headed back toward the New Hampshire woods . The mounted man rode alongside with never a backward glance . Will climbed to the wagon seat . He was n't looking forward to the long ride back to Boston . They 'd be lucky to arrive by dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked him to come along . A man like the one they 'd just met might have robbed a solitary student , and abandoned the corpses somewhere  --  or , knowing he 'd be safe from prosecution , never brought them at all . Drew hawed to the horse . " Someday doctors will understand what goes wrong in the human chemistry to cause a thing like that . " " Do you suppose it was his son ? " A shrug . " Son , brother , nephew  --  how could anyone tell ? There must be a way to prevent such monstrosities . If I did n't think medicine could eventually find it , I sure as hell would n't be out here . Of course ? " Drew sounded disagreeable , perhaps because he was cold and tense , Will thought . " ? I 'm sure I 'm boring you by discussing what medicine may one day do for others . You care most about what it can do for you . " Will scowled . " Spare me the lecture , will you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! Someone needs to convince you that the purpose of medicine is to ferret out the causes of disease and heal the sick , not line the pockets of the practitioner . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , Drew  --  enough ! I know the rest by heart anyway . Practice in the city ! Do good among the downtrodden ! No thank you . I say every doctor should have the right to choose where he wants to practice , and how . You take the charity hospital , I 'll take a drawing room . In ten years we 'll compare notes and see who 's happier . " " All right , your life is none of my business , " Drew muttered . He did n't sound as if he believed it . Both of them were silent for a while . The wagon lurched on along a road already rutted by the first hard freezes of the season . At the outskirts of Lowell they found a tavern . Will guarded the wagon while Drew went inside to buy two mugs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick , raspy apology which concluded with the words : " I sometimes forget you 're my friend and think of you only as a damn good student ? " " So that 's the new tack , " Will broke in , sarcastic . " When bullying fails , try flattery ? " " No flattery . You did n't hear the rest . I meant to say a damn good student who 's going in the wrong direction . " With effort , Will held his temper . " Not the wrong direc-  | tion , Drew . Just a direction that is n't the same as yours . " Drew managed a laugh . " Amounts to the same thing , does n't it ? Anyway , I 'm sorry . I wo n't lecture again . " " Good ! " Will lifted the battered pewter mug ; savored the smell of the rum . He 'd won a respite but he did n't really believe Drew 's promise . He 'd heard it too many times before . Lecture on principles of asepsis &; antisepsis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. Surg. ( 1 ) Listerism presaged as early as 1843 in Dr. O. W. Holmes ' paper postulating contagion of puerperal fever &; transmission of same by physician 's hands . ( 2 ) Semmelweis mistakenly given exclusive credit for this idea ( Cheever claim ! ) The lecture notes blurred in front of Will 's eyes . He laid the notes on his desk , stood , and turned away from the wall fixture with the shaded incandescent bulb . About three dozen of the fixtures were now installed throughout the house on Beacon Street . Will did n't like incandescent light . He found it harsh and unnatural . He walked to the window , gazed down at the Common and the sleet slashing through the December darkness . For over two hours he 'd vainly been trying to concentrate on his notes . It was well past midnight and he had a great deal of studying yet to do . Tomorrow he had examinations covering the anatomy course and the material from the surgery lectures . But he was too upset to study . The morning mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a short letter , mailed in Denver where his stepbrother was tending bar in a saloon : Not exactly the fulfillment of my great ambitions , little brother ! Over and over , I learn one lesson . You had better run others or they 'll run you . Unfortunately , as my present low position testifies , I have yet to find a way to move from the latter state to the former . But by Heaven I will  --  count on it .  | That was the only positive note in an otherwise cynical and despondent missive . Ever since reading it for the first time , Will had debated about showing it to his stepmother . Now he decided against it . He usually shared Carter 's letters , profanity and all , but this one was too dark and defeated in tone . It would probably disturb Julia as much as it disturbed him . Distantly , a downstairs clock rang the hour of one . Will rubbed his cheeks . Tomorrow 's beard had already sprouted . He cast a disgruntled eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , get to it , " he muttered , " or you wo n't ever be called doctor . " That , unfortunately , made him think of Drew . Even when Will earned a Harvard diploma , Drew probably would n't grant him the right to call himself doctor . Not unless he practiced medicine exactly the way Drew thought it should be practiced . Damn his high-flown pronouncements ! Will thought , savagely kicking his chair . But he was wasting energy . He had examinations to pass tomorrow . The two tests were harder than any he 'd taken during his first year . This was in keeping with President Eliot 's program to make each year 's curriculum more challenging than the one before , the over-all purpose being a general improvement in the reputation of the Harvard medical degree . For this reform , as well as others , Eliot had the backing of a substantial number of progressive faculty members . But he 'd also encountered opposition from a group of medical school professors who were more conservative . That opposition was ferocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . The reactionary forces in the medical school were powerful and well entrenched . Even men of acknowledged intelligence resisted change . Henry Bigelow , the former head of the surgical department and now emeritus professor , came to mind . Though  | Bigelow had a reputation as a fine teacher and an innovative practitioner , he had nevertheless steadfastly refused to accept Listerism for more than two decades ; had even refused to grant the possibility of its value  --  and this in a decade in which doctors who did n't embrace all Lister 's ideas were adopting some of them on a selective basis . Carbolic as the preferred antiseptic , for instance ; surgical drainage with Chassiagnac 's tube ; use of silk or catgut ligatures that were short cut , carbolated , and buried . Bigelow had closed his mind against every facet of Lister 's technique . Old hands at the school claimed he had n't always been so reactionary . They said he 'd been enthusiastic about ether anesthesia when the Boston dentist , Morton , had first demonstrated it . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will was thankful that Charles Eliot was trying to make the Harvard degree more prestigious . That should help further his career . He also liked new ideas , and the professors who taught them . He hoped that after forty-two years had passed , he 'd still favor innovations , and not be as fossilized as Bigelow . At the moment , however , his primary feeling was relief . He 'd passed the examinations . He could relax and enjoy the holiday season . On Friday night at the end of examination week , some fellow students invited him to go out and celebrate . They were some of the more boisterous second- and third-class men . Drew was n't among them . Will needed a change in his routine . He accepted the invitation , thinking the others meant to go to a theater , or to a beer hall for supper . Only after a hired hack picked him up on Beacon Street did he learn the actual destina-tion : " Nicest little whorehouse in Cambridge . High class . Most of the girls read novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde with a contralto as big as her tits . She can treat you to some Wagner , if that 's your persuasion . " - The speaker was a frivolous young New Yorker named Joe Marchant . " You 'll have a fine time , " he promised . " You need to let down once in a while , Kent . You spend too much time philosophizing with Deacon Drew . " Will laughed . " Is that what you call him  --  Deacon ? "  | " Not to his face , " said another of the students crowded into the hack . There was a tremor in Will 's groin when he thought of their destination . In one way , he was more than ready to visit a bordello . But he was apprehensive , too . He must have showed , it . Marchant said : " The place we 're going is perfectly safe . The crowd 's respectable . Well , most of the time . Occasionally they let in regular Harvard undergraduates . Then everything deteriorates . " Laughter . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over every week to conduct an inspection . Madam Melba , the lady who runs the place , gives payment in trade . There are benefits to medicine you never imagined . " " Amen to that , " Will agreed with a smile , hoping to forestall any questions that might reveal the prime cause of his nervousness . He had never been to bed with a woman . He 'd kept his inexperience a secret even from Drew . It made him feel inferior , especially among the older students , who bragged a lot . Even if half of their claimed conquests were fictitious , they still had impressive records . Though Will was nervous , he was glad Marchant and the others had invited him along . The hack rattled on toward the Charles and the bridge at Cambridge Street . It was another foul night , and growing worse . In addition to a drizzle , fog had rolled in from the ocean . It blurred the gas lamps and occasional electric lights in passing houses . Will 's mood became a blend of excitement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something that would make his innocence apparent to the girls at the brothel . His concerns were only for the events of the next few hours . There was no way for him to realize then that the trip to Cambridge , and all that would happen before the night was over , would have consequences affecting his life for years to come .  | " HOW OLD ARE YOU , DEAR ? " The simplest , most familiar tasks had become hard all at once . Taking his left leg out of his trousers , for instance . He got impossibly tangled and almost fell over . At the last minute , he braced his hand against the gaudily papered wall of the windowless cubicle . He answered the red-haired prostitute 's question without looking at her : " Twenty-one . " " Come now , I do n't believe that for a minute . You do n't need to hide your real age . It has nothing to do with being able to give a lady a jolly time . Well , almost nothing ? here , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still caught . The woman glided up behind him . In the parlor she 'd introduced herself as Aggie . She was thirty or so . She had a long fall of red hair that reached to the midpoint of her back . Her nose was large and freckled under a thick layer of powder . Her lips were thin . The bodice of her nainsook camisole , all trimmed with lace and threaded with baby blue ribbon , accented the smallness of her breasts ; little bigger than ripe peaches . Yet her experienced eyes and her scent  --  warm skin mingled with perfume  --  gave her an air of sexuality that was dizzying . " I do take back that remark about age , " she said as she reached from behind and grasped him through his linen drawers . He reacted with a quiver . She laughed : " You see ? The younger a fellow is , the larger and livelier . Now tell me your true age . " " Eighteen , Miss ? " Aggie . " Her fingers moved on him ; caressing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when it comes to getting your trousers off , it helps to take your shoes off first . " He 'd completely forgotten . Scarlet-faced , he lurched to the narrow bed . He sat on the edge and struggled to remove his shoes . One thumped to the floor , then the other . Aggie bore all his grimacing and heavy breathing with professional good humor . Before he knew it , they were both naked and she was drawing him down beside her on the bed . With a very slight note of urgency , she said : " We must n't be too slow , love . You only paid five dollars . Madam Melba does n't like her employees to dawdle . " There 'd be no dawdling , she saw to that . She began to caress him and slide her mouth across his bare shoulder , his neck , his face . He was astonished that such a thin mouth could feel so warm and wet and passionate . He slid into her with amazing ease . The amber bowls on the room 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep light that seemed to brighten and fade ? brighten and fade  --  matching the accelerating tempo of their lovemaking . All too quickly , unstoppable forces were let loose . " Oh my God , " he gasped , shutting his eyes . A moment later , she said , " That was very nice , dear . " The warm web of her hair touched his shoulder and spread over the small , heavily starched pillow . " Your first time , was n't it ? " She laid her palm against his perspiring cheek . He felt sublime , sinful , drained , grown up . Her smile had a touch of sadness : " Was n't it ? " " Yes . " " Well , it was very nice indeed . Madam Melba does n't require me to say that , you know . Here ? " She drew his head down on her bony shoulder . " We still have a few minutes . Rest . " Even though his eyes were closed , Will quickly came back to a sense of where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled dirt street between the river and the university . Only a couple of nearby cottages were visible in the fog . Weed-infested vacant lots adjoined the bordello on either side , and water filled deep ruts at the foot of the ramshackle steps out in front . The house itself was  | clapboard , with heavy curtains at every window to hide the business conducted inside . Once through the front door , the depressing effect of the fog and the dark was banished , replaced by sounds and sights that soothed and pleased the senses . Polite laughter blended with dazzling piano arpeggios . All the gas fixtures made a soft glow through their glass bowls . The mingled scents of powder , perfume , and cigarette smoke gave the air a languorous quality . Madam Melba was a proper , spinsterish woman in a high-necked gown . She had greeted the arriving students gravely and even pecked Joe Marchant 's cheek as if she were his maiden aunt . From the foyer they 'd moved to the parlor , where the smoke and the perfume were much heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensual . Will vividly remembered the first look that had passed between him and Aggie . He also remembered something that marred the otherwise pleasant picture . A huge , flatfaced man was posted beside a table just this side of the hallway leading to the rooms . The man took Will 's money and gave him a surly look . In the hack , Marchant had issued a warning about the man : " She has a big Hungarian working for her . Do n't say anything smart to him . He hates the college crowd , and they say he 's killed three or four men right here in Boston . " Tonight the flat-faced man had a great many targets for his hostility . Harvard students made up most of Madam Melba 's trade . Whether or not the fellow was indeed Hungarian did n't much matter . By looks and by occupation , he qualified for the name , which was widely if inaccurately used , especially by newspapers . Criminals whose origins could n't be identified easily were always Hungarians . If not that , Slays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will realized he 'd picked the only woman in the place with hair the color of Dolores Wertrnan 's Dolores . Her face floated in his mind as he drowsed on Aggie 's shoulder . He could almost imagine it was Dolores who had responded so ardently to his lovemaking . The thought of Dolores triggered an explosion of shame . Aggie felt the sudden tension in his body . She shifted her  | head far enough to get a view of his face . She touched his cheek again . " What a guilty look you have ! Did n't you enjoy ? ? " " Very much , " he broke in . He did n't want her feeling bad . " But you 're red as an apple . What 's wrong ? " " Nothing . " The lie was obvious . Trying to put him at ease , she snuggled closer . " Please tell me what 's wrong . " He managed to gather his nerve and say with a shy smile , " It was just  --  so easy to love you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or complicated ? " " I did n't know . " " Love should be easy . Pleasant . With no remorse afterward . " His color deepened . " That is n't what I was brought up to believe . " 11 " Ah . That 's it . Half the boys who come here have the same problem . Well ? " Another reassuring pat . " You do n't have to rush to the altar just because we made love . It may work like that elsewhere , but not in here . " He was embarrassed that she 'd guessed his secret thoughts . He had indeed been thinking that a respectable girl , compromised this way , would have sobbed and demanded that he marry her in return for what she had given him in a moment of weakness . And his own conscience would have insisted that he do what the girl , and society , said was only ri A crash brought his eyes open . From down the hall he heard an angry shout . Aggie sat up and pressed her palm against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's wrong . " Naked , her thinness pitifully evident , she ran to the door and peered out . Both of them heard loud voices  --  a man 's and a woman 's , the latter shrill and vindictive . Instantly , he had a sense of danger . Aggie shut the door , leaned against it and scratched herself . " Nothing serious . Just a small dispute down the hall . " But it did n't sound small to him . The woman screamed an obscenity . The floor vibrated as someone or something fell . Boots pounded . Someone was in trouble . Maybe a fellow student . He remembered the Hungarian . If one student got in trouble , all of them might  | He pushed up from the bed . " Let me take a look . " Aggie protested but he ignored her . He pulled on his drawers , then his pants . With a nervous glance at his face , she moved away from the door . Heart hammering , Will lifted the latch and stepped into the dim hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a towel around his middle was confronting a naked blonde with shoulders and thighs as big as an ironworker 's . She towered over her customer , but he was n't intimidated : " I saw you reach for my wallet . " " Damn liar ! " the blonde retorted . Marchant poked his head out of another door . Noticing Will , the blonde said to him , " You should have heard what he asked me to do for him . Or with him , I 'm not sure which . I said no , so now he 's accusing me ? " " Of being a thief ! " the curly-haired young man broke in . Madam Melba hove into view at the end of the hall , followed by the lumbering thug with the flattened face . He unbuttoned his shabby jacket to show a billy club in his belt . Madam Melba stepped between the quarreling pair , shoving each of them roughly . " I 'll have no disorderly behavior in this establishment , Mr. Pennel . My unofficial truce with the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't deny I was asking for  --  something special , " the student said . " I 'd have paid . What I wanted does n't change what she did . She tried to steal my money . " Will leaned against the wall , watching the flat-faced man , who was glowering at the angry customer . Pennel , Will thought . A familiar name . But he could n't place it . Madam Melba dismissed the accusation with one word . " Nonsense . " She put her arm around the blonde 's pudgy waist . " Alice is the newest of our girls , but I screen every applicant most carefully . I run an honest house , and you and all the other young gentlemen from Harvard know I do , Mr. Pennel . " " Maybe I know it , but she does n't , " Pennel shot back .  | The flat-faced man was fingering the billy club . The corridor was growing crowded as whores and their customers popped out of the cubicles . The situation might have eased if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to have the authorities look into this place . " Madam Melba 's gaze grew chill . " Be careful about uttering threats like that , young man . We ca n't afford to treat them lightly . " " You damn well better not ! I 'm getting out of here and going to the police . " He spun and started back into his cubicle . Madam Melba pondered only a moment . She waved to summon her helper : " You 'd better do a little something to dissuade him , Rudy . " A smile spread over the thug 's face . He yanked the billy from his belt and sauntered toward the door of the cubicle , pleased to be the center of attention . Will was alarmed to see that none of the students moved to help Pennel . In a place like this , trouble for one of them meant trouble for all . Maybe a few conciliatory words could avert it . Impulsively , he stepped forward . The thug stopped and glared . Will slid past him , blocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes . It took all the courage Will possessed to look past the flat-faced man and say to Madam Melba : " Give him a chance to calm down . Maybe we can get him out of here and avoid a muss . " Madam Melba was clearly anxious for a peaceful settlement . She rushed to Will 's side : " You mean no reports to the police ? " " I do n't know Mr. Pennel personally , so I ca n't promise . But I 'll certainly talk to him . If there 's fighting , someone else in the neighborhood will call the police , and then we 're all in dutch . I do n't think anyone here wants to be involved in a scandal ? " Other students in the hall murmured anxious agreement . Headlines flashed into Will 's mind . LAW INVADES SPORTING HOUSE . PUBLISHER 'S SON ARRESTED . What did they do to you at the medical school for such an offense ? Dismiss you , most likely .  | " Please , Madam Melba , give me a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like the interference . He grabbed Will 's shoulder : " I 'll do the talking that needs to be done here . " Will put a palm against the man 's left arm , to hold him back . " Let her answer me before you ? " " Do n't shove me , you college fucker , " the man shouted . Before Madam Melba could step in , he slammed the billy against the side of Will 's head . WILL CRASHED BACKWARDS into the wall . Flimsy paneling broke . He reached high over his head , snatching at a gas fixture to keep from falling . The blowsy blonde lunged at him , hands forming claws . " Little bastard ! Who asked you to interfere ? " she shrieked . The flat-faced man flung her aside and rammed the end of the billy into Will 's left hip . A little higher and it might have done serious damage . But it glanced off bone and gave him time to grab the thug 's wrist . An unexpected twist of the wrist loosened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught it . The thug fisted his hand and launched a punch that could have broken Will 's neck if it had landed . Will ducked . The man 's hand smashed a hole in the wall and disappeared up to the elbow . Will hit the back of the man 's neck with the billy . The thug yelled , his arm tearing strips of wood from the wall as he staggered away . Will helped him along by ramming the billy into his groin . The man crashed against the opposite wall , screaming like a gored animal . Madam Melba had abandoned all pretense of gentility . " Carrie , fetch my horse pistol ! I 'll show these rich brats they ca n't tear up my house . "  | The naked blonde kicked Will 's shin and clawed his face . One nail nicked his left eye , momentarily blinding him . She tore the stick out of his hand , turned , and sought another target . Joe Marchant was hurrying to help Will at last . The blonde hit Marchant 's head three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical student went down in a slow corkscrew , blood pouring from a gash in his scalp . The blonde turned back to Will , charging like a jiggling I white elephant . He did n't want to hurt a woman . On the other hand , he had no intention of letting her maim him . t , He put up both hands and shoved , managing to hurl her off balance . Cursing , she fell against Madam Melba , knocked her down and landed , buttocks first , on the madam 's scrawny bosom . Madam Melba flailed and shrieked . She might have been a longshoreman , so obscenely did she curse the students and so loudly did she scream for the horse pistol one of her girls was attempting to pass to her . Alice was still floundering on top of her employer . " Get your fat hams out of my face ! " Madam Melba howled , pinching the blonde 's backside . The blonde shot up like a cannonball . Will , meantime , took the only escape route left open to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his shoes and trousers on . The moment Will burst in , Pennel yelled and pointed : " Watch out behind you ! " Will spun . The flat-faced man was lurching across the hall with one hand outstretched and the other still rubbing his groin . Desperate , Will hunted for a weapon . There was none . A small , cheap armoire stood beside the door . He leaped to the end of the armoire , put his shoulder against it and pushed . The armoire moved easily ; evidently there was n't much inside . He shoved the armoire diagonally into the doorway an instant before the thug appeared . The man 's outstretched arm was pinned between the doorframe and the piece of I1 furniture Will was pushing with all his strength . Bone 11 1 in the man 's arm cracked . He screamed . it Wild-eyed , he struggled to extricate his arm and kick the armoire aside . In the corridor , Harvard men were running to and fro while whores in various stages of undress ' ' '  | punched and kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cubicle . He and Pennel were trapped No ! Next to the headboard hung a velvet drapery . Old ; shabby  --  and rippling slowly . Will leaped past Pennel , tore the drapery down and whooped . Unlike Aggie 's cubicle , this one had a window . It was raised a couple of inches . Outside there was nothing but mist and the dark . " Out that way ! " Will ordered . Pennel snatched up his shirt and coat , then tried to raise the window . " Stuck ! " " Put your coat over you and go head first . " In the corridor there was more punching and screaming and crashing , the pandemonium heightened by Madam Melba 's torrent of oaths , and then by the boom of her pistol . Pennel swallowed , covered his head and dove at the glass , shattering it , and tearing his trousers as he plunged through . Will heard him as he hit the muddy ground . Will scrambled through the sawtoothed opening and leaped , landing in watery ooze and sinking ankle deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sprawled face first . But his only injury was a scratch on his left forearm . Covered with mud and spitting , he scrambled to his feet . A spectral hand , equally filthy , shot toward him out of the fog . The other student was barely visible as he shook Will 's hand and whispered : " Marcus Pennel . " " Will Kent . " " Thanks for what you did . " " Never mind that now . Got your wallet ? " " In my pocket . You at the college ? " " Medical school . Let 's get going ! " Madam Melba appeared at the broken window . " I 'll teach you to disrupt and vandalize a decent , orderly business establishment ! " Beyond the other student 's shoulder , Will saw her pistol glinting . He dove against Pennel and knocked him into another puddle . There was a roar , a streak of fire in the dark . Before Madam Melba could fire again , they leaped up and ran . Neither paid any attention to the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thick fog , too shaken to be If amused by some of the brawl 's comical aspects . All at once he slowed down . He looked to the left , to the right , and behind . He was running alone . He stopped ; listened . In the murk , shouts reverberated , and loud crashings . At that precise moment a door in his memory sprang open . " God above . Marcus Pennel . " He 'd come to the aid of a member of one of the very richest families in America ; a family even wealthier than ' Will 's , and so long entrenched in New York Society that by comparison , the Kents were upstart immigrants . He started walking , moving rapidly but without a sense of fear . The thick fog would protect him from further danger . . Rain began to fall again , dampening the mud that was drying on his arms and bare back . He was uncomfortable but he did n't mind . " Pennel , " he said again . As he recalled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of Manhattan with a pushcart , sometime during the early years of the eighteenth century . Today the family had real estate holdings nearly as vast as those of the Vanderbilts . In the midnineteenth century , the Pennels had begun to accumulate a second fortune by constructing and leasing factory build-ings on land they owned all along the East Coast . Their I money was old money ; polished into respectability by the , ' passage of many generations . For a moment Will fervently wished he had n't become confused and lost Pennel in the fog . He 'd have liked to get to know the young man he 'd helped . It could have been a useful contact for the future . But of course no member of the Pennel family would deign to speak to a Kent unless it became necessary during some commercial transaction . He 'd never see Marcus Pen- ' nel again . As it turned out , he saw him the following Wednesday night .  | Marcus Pennel called at the house on Beacon Street . He wore a suit of expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray gloves . He strolled around the Kent parlor with an air of authority quite at odds with the panic he 'd displayed at the brothel . " Did n't have a proper chance to thank you , Kent . Took a wrong turn and lost you somewhere . Trust you got back here in one piece ? " Pennel was at least two years older than Will . He had an amiable , boyish smile and gave the impression that he did n't take anything seriously , though Will knew better . He took the contents of his wallet very seriously . A family trait , no doubt . In response to the question , Will smiled and nodded . " I was damn near frozen . Luckily my parents had gone to bed by the time I got here . I did n't have to explain why I was half naked and covered with mud . " " How 's that other fellow ? The one who got coshed ? " Embarrassed , Will said , " I do n't know what you mean by coshed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain last summer . Coshed means hit on the noggin . " " Then you 're talking about Marchant . " " I ' spose . I do n't know the chap 's name . I was looking out the door just as he fell . " " He 's all right . Some of the others from the medical school sewed up the gash in his scalp after they all got away . I 'm told Madam Melba handed out some bribe money to the proper authorities and is doing business as usual . " Marcus sniffed . " Last time I patronize the old slut . That Hungarian would have nailed my balls to the ceiling if I 'd been forced to deal with him all by myself . I was n't carrying enough cash to buy him off , and that 's the only way I know to handle such scum . You came to my rescue ? " Will waved off the compliment . " I 'm just thankful we got out safely . Glad you got your wallet back , too . " Marcus took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lit a cigarette . " Oh , the girl did n't try to steal  | anything of mine . She just would n't perform the  --  ah-special Vi service I requested . I got damned mad about it . " ! , " , Will felt victimized . But it was clear his visitor was n't interested in his reaction ; he did n't even glance in Will 's direction . And Will decided his annoyance was worth it when Marcus said : " The purpose of my call is to show you I 'm genuinely grateful for what you did . If you 've some free time over 11 Christmas , I 'd like you to join a house party we 're having at our place down in Westchester County . " Will was so overwhelmed , he could n't speak for a moment . Marcus raised an eyebrow . " That 's outside New York City . " " Yes , I know where it is . That 's very kind of you , Pennel . " " Call me Marcus . I think fate , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordained that we 'd be friends . You 'll like Pennel House over the holidays . Lots of bright young people around . Lots of charming females . " He scrutinized Will ' with mock seriousness . " You might even take a fancy to my sister Laura . She 's a year younger than I , but a pretty piece of fluff , if I do say so . The Harvard boys I bring home do n't seem to interest her in the slightest . Perhaps a learned physician will break the pattern . " Excited by the thought of what the invitation could pll mean to his career , Will nevertheless felt it prudent not to ! , , appear too eager : " See here , Pennel ? " " It 's Marcus , did n't I say ? " " Very well  --  Marcus . You need n't invite me just to give me some kind of  --  reward , as you put it . I was glad to help you . " Even though I was scared as hell doing it . " Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  balancing one favor against another  --  that 's what the world is all about . That and nothing else . " His smile was cordial , yet a little smug . He rose and held out his hand . " My driver 's waiting . I have other calls to make , but this was the most important . We 'll expect you at Pennel House the day after Christmas . "  | When Gideon heard the news , he never thought to probe Will 's statement that he 'd met Marcus Pennel through mutual friends at Harvard . He was too busy being exercised : " Bunch of hypocritical robbers , the Pennels . Thurman Pennel , the boy 's father , is a mossback of the worst kind . " " You 've met him ? " " Yes , unfortunately . I had a run-in with him at the last Republican nominating convention . He 'd like to see us roll blissfully backward into the eighteenth century  --  or perhaps the Middle Ages . Then no one would presume to question his right to make money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts up the most efficient factory buildings in New England . Companies stand in line to lease them . I shudder to think of the number of young girls and children who die because he designs those buildings to be free of distractions for the workers . I 'm referring to distractions such as windows that admit sunlight and fresh air . I 'm surprised you want to get involved with people like that . " Irked , Will shot back , " Papa , it 's a social occasion . I 'm not endorsing the way the Pennels live . " Gideon cast a dour eye over his son . " Do n't be too sure . " Drew was even more caustic about the invitation : " By God , you are determined to be a Fifth Avenue doctor , are n't you ? But ascending the social heights via the window of a whorehouse  --  that must be some kind of first . " Will refused to be baited . His life was his to live as he chose , and he had no intention of missing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL FIRST SAW Pennel House through the slowly falling snow of a December afternoon . Even counting William K. Vanderbilt 's palace on Fifth Avenue , he 'd never seen a more magnificent residence . Centerpiece I ! ! of a two-hundred-acre estate forty minutes north of the ff ; city by train , Pennel House was not only stunning in its own right , but symbolic of , and appropriate to , the position of its owners . Their world contained everything that was worth having  --  or so Will had convinced himself while an-11 , ticipating this visit . The mansion had been designed in popular and eclec-tic ti style . It was a three-story , fifty-four-room castle with no two exterior elements matching . Shape pulled against 11 shape , color against color , texture against texture . The ground floor was pale limestone trimmed with dark brick ; the second story was shingled , the third half-timbered , gabled , and roofed with slates of several colors . Balconies , porches , and dormers interrupted the facade at a dozen places . Two huge chimneys dominated one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense round tower jutted into the gloomy sky . The mansion 's windows resembled painter 's palettes ; light of every conceivable color was cast on the snow by intricate patterns of stained glass . Curiously , the jumble of elements and techniques was so over-stated that it achieved a certain reverse elegance , its ostentation declaring to the world that a Midas lived here ? for who but a Midas could afford such extravagant con-fusion ? The Pennel carriage , sent to meet Will at the railroad station , pulled up at the main entrance to the house . The postilion jumped down , eyebrows and hat brim snow-  | encrusted . He began unloading Will 's three pieces of luggage . Marcus burst out the front door , a toddy mug in hand . " Welcome , my friend ! We 've been expecting you for an hour . " " The snow 's getting heavy on the roads . " He shook Marcus ' hand and moved gratefully from the cold air to the warmth of the immense baronial foyer . Pennel House was as elaborate inside as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative scrollwork , heavy furniture , all in the Queen Anne style . Gas and lamplight on polished paneling and a parquet floor created a warm atmosphere helping to offset the forbidding vastness of the foyer . Will quickly decided that despite the jumble of styles , motifs , and materials , the house had a definite appeal . It was just the sort of place in which he could be happy . Servants took Will 's coat , hat , stick , and gloves and whisked them out of sight . With a grin , Marcus said to him : " I 've built you up to Laura something fierce . Handsome , all-knowing physician to whom no crevice of a woman 's body is a mystery  --  or sacred . " Will turned red . " Good God . Your sister will run the other way . " " On the contrary . All we get here are chaps with pedigrees , never one with brains . Till you , I mean . She 's mad to meet you . " " I 'm anxious to meet her too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now . She and the others went skating on the pond . But I 'm glad the place is n't swarming with our friends . It gives me a chance to introduce you to Father . " He grasped Will 's arm and steered him toward massive , intricately carved doors of dark wood . A footman rushed forward , seized a heavy bronze ring and opened the righthand door . Will said : " I 'm worried about the way you described me to your sister . She 's in for a mighty disappointment . " " Nonsense ! " Marcus waved with his mug . Some of the toddy splattered the footman 's coat . The man blinked but said nothing . Apparently Marcus did n't even notice . " She 'll be charmed . I keep telling you that you 're like no guest we 've ever had at Pennel House . "  | That was probably true , Will thought , but not in the sense that Marcus meant it . He had done some investigation of the Pennels . In terms of social position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thurman Pennel no longer dirtied his hands with direct involvement in his business empire . He merely issued orders to underlings . " Father has a guest , but he said it 's all right to break in . Follow me . " Marcus led his visitor into a huge but surprisingly cheer- i1 ful room which resembled pictures of English castles that I 'll Will had seen . The room  --  the living hall , Marcus called it  --  was crowded with furniture , potted plants , and brie-abrac . A large open stairway dominated the inner wall . The outer one was pierced by narrow windows of leaded stained glass . In the wall directly ahead was a large , lofty recess . Within the inglenook , two perspiring men sat on thickly padded bench seats which faced one another in front of an immense hearth . Fragrant logs blazed in the grate and set reflections to shimmering on polished floor tiles . Marcus and Will stopped at a respectful distance . The larger of the IJ two men was saying in a slurred voice : " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , Andrew . That damned Democrat is dangerous . He must be turned out before he engineers the ruin of the system under which we 've both prospered . " - " I canna help but agree , Thurman . But he 's the incumbent . We must start now if we mean to defeat him . That 's why we 're seeking your guarantee of support this far ahead of the election . We ? " j , Il The speaker stopped suddenly , warned by the nervous eyes of the heavier man . Marcus moved forward . Both men rose and stepped out of the inglenook . Will knew that he and Marcus had interrupted a conversation about President Cleveland . The Republicans had been infuriated by the President 's annual address to Congress on December 6 . The President had devoted the entire message to a carefully structured plea for reduced tariffs  --  a proposal which was anathema to the protectionists in the Republican party . Gideon had predicted that the tariff  | would be the major issue of next year 's campaign . The conversation just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus said , " I 'd like you and your guest to meet my friend Will Kent . " He addressed the larger of the two men . Thurman Pennel stood well over six feet . He was paunchy and had lost most of his hair . Only a few dark , oiled wisps were left , combed across his hairless skull . His visitor , fifty or a bit older , was noticeably shorter and leaner . White whiskers lent him a benign air , though his eyes were foxy , even hard . When Marcus spoke Will 's last name , the visitor raked Will with an appraising glance . Meantime , Marcus ' father said : " How do you do , Kent ? I 'm Thurman Pennel . We 're happy to have you here . " He extended his hand and smiled , but there was no cordiality in his heavy-lidded eyes , just as there had been none in his welcome . Marcus did n't resemble his father , Will noticed . Perhaps he favored his mother . " I appreciate the invitation , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was uncomfortably hot near the fire . Pine boughs hung up to decorate the living hall gave off an odor that was cloyingly sweet . There was another sweet smell in the air , but Will could n't immediately identify it . " This is Mr. Carnegie , " Pennel said . " Andrew  --  Mr. Kent . " The sinewy little man shook hands . His grip was strong . " Related to the Boston Kents , by any chance ? " " Gideon Kent is my father . " " I see . " Carnegie 's lips twitched ; it could never have been called a smile . " Well , lad , we 'll na hold that against you . " Will kept his temper as best he could . He knew Carnegie 's name and background , of course . Almost everyone in the nation did . An immigrant from Scotland , Carnegie had begun his working career as a bobbin boy . Today he controlled a steadily expanding complex of steel factories . Will had heard his father say Carnegie was pulling the American steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-handedly . " British steelmakers would like to see him dead , " was Gideon 's summation . To judge from Carnegie 's hale and leathery look , he would probably be around for many years .  | Carnegie 's smile remained as cold as the air Will had quitted a few moments ago . " I 'll na lie to you , young man . I can not abide your father 's views . They say he was once a Republican ? " The little man clearly found that hard to believe . Marcus looked unhappy about the trend of the conversation . Thurman Pennel said , " He showed his true colors when he deserted Blaine in the last national election . Your father and I had a discussion about Mr. Blaine at the nominating convention . No , I guess discussion does n't quite cover it ? " Pennel smiled just as his guest had done  --  to make it seem as if he were uttering a little joke when he was actually indulging his malice : " He started to knock me down . The same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refuse to stand for this , Will thought . But politeness won out . Pennel was his host , and Gideon was the first to admit his opinions were n't popular among Republicans . Still pretending to smile , Pennel added , " Hot-tempered , these ex-Rebs , eh ? " Will 's face was white . He kept his voice level : " That 's true , sir . They can be very hot-tempered when they believe something strongly . My father believed Mr. Blaine was a crook . " Pennel scowled . But Carnegie 's expression changed from distaste to grudging admiration . Pennel noticed his guest 's approval  --  and then his son 's distressed look . He was n't so tactless as to pursue the little quarrel further . He again resorted to that false joviality : " In any case , Kent , you 're the one invited for a visit , not your father- " He stepped to Will 's side and clapped him on the shoulder . Will smelled the sweet odor again , and recognized it . Gin . No wonder Pennel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I talked that way when I drank , I would n't drink . He continued to resent the criticism of his father . Then , on a more practical tack , he remembered some of the reasons he 'd wanted to come to Pennel House . He decided he 'd better do something to blunt that criticism : " Perhaps I ought to explain something , Mr. Pennel . My  | father 's a publisher but I 'm studying to be a doctor . Two different careers . Two different people . My father understands that . Politics has ruined many a friendship . I do n't intend for it to ruin any of mine . " " D' ya mean to say you stay neutral , lad ? " Carnegie 's disapproval of neutrality was quite evident . Will stared him down and said , " No , sir . I have my own views . But I do n't debate them . Especially when I 'm a guest in someone 's house . " Marcus smiled . Thurman Pennel was immediately more cordial : " I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A doctor does n't develop a loyal clientele by stepping on the toes of patients with whom he disagrees . You seem to have learned that lesson early . " Will squared his shoulders and met Pennel 's lidded gaze . The man was opinionated and more than a little drunk ; Will disliked him intensely . But he smiled , stifled a twinge of conscience and said : " I 've tried to learn it , Mr. Pennel . " Before he could say more , someone came rushing down the open staircase : " We 're back , Marcus . Is this your friend ? You must present me at once ! " The men forgotten , Will turned toward the stairs . With considerable relief , Marcus said : " Will , here 's Laura . " Will immediately lost interest in meeting the other members of the house party who followed Marcus ' sister into the living room . The group consisted of four young gentlemen from Dartmouth and Yale , and three other young ladies , vapid and noisy , who attended private schools . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful girl , a year older than Will , pale-skinned and immaculately groomed . She had slightly slanted gray eyes , and straw-colored hair that fell in tight natural curls . Curly hair was a characteristic both she and her brother had evidently inherited from their mother ; it certainly did n't come from the paternal side .  | She was dressed fashionably , in a severely tailored suit . The mauve skirt and jacket contrasted with a snug white shirtwaist beneath . An ascot was neatly pinned at the center of her full bosom . Her face was sweet , though it was an animated sweetness , quite unlike the insipid look of many beautiful girls . There was an innocence about her , too , an aura that told him she was a person incapable of a wicked thought or deed , at least not an intentional one . He tried to be pleasant and witty as he replied to a few inconsequential questions about his family and his trip from Boston . He felt he was making a fool of himself . Not that it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the living hall accompanied by her friends . He was so flustered , all he could remember of their entire conversation was one fact . She would see him at supper in half an hour . Marcus showed him up to his bedroom in the tower wing . " You and Laura seemed to hit it off instantly , " Marcus said when they were halfway up the stairs . " She 's a lovely young woman . " " And you look like a gentleman who 's been thoroughly smitten . " " The instant I saw her , " Will said with a nod , his light tone concealing the strength of his feeling . Still , his conscience nagged at him : Would you have been smitten if her name were something other than Pennel ? Would you have been so quick to turn your back on your father and try to ingratiate yourself with hers ? " Here we are , " Marcus said , turning in at a bedroom door and temporarily relieving Will of the burden of listening to that accusing voice .  |  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away in a bureau and an armoire . He set about changing his shirt . Marcus lingered . Something was on his mind . Presently he brought it into the open : " You got a dreadful welcome from my father . You must forgive him , Will . He is n't too competent playing the role of gracious host . And when he 's had too much to drink , he 's far from tactful . " " Oh , that 's all right ? " Will began . " It certainly is n't . " Marcus blew his nose , then lit a cigarette . " He insulted you . He 'll never apologize , so I must . " Will shrugged to suggest the apology was accepted , though not considered important or necessary . Marcus slouched in a chair and ' hooked a leg over the arm . He peered at the end of his cigarette . " Might as well tell you something else . You 'll notice it soon enough anyway . Mother and Father are n't exactly what you 'd call loving spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strained . Father 's got a shopgirl in town . He keeps her in one of those new French flats near Forty-fifth and Lexington . I do n't believe Mother knows about it . But she certainly suspects . If she ever gets definite proof , I suppose she 'll throw him out . The friction does nothing to improve the atmosphere in this house . " Will was startled but tried to conceal it . Marcus expected him to take the revelations in stride . A man was always free to enjoy a woman 's favors so long as that woman had loose morals , and could by no stretch of the imagination be considered a potential wife  --  although as  | the prostitute Aggie had sensed , Will had trouble being that cavalier about any girl . He reached for a hair brush . In a calm voice he said , " You surprise me , Marcus . You and your sister act as if there is n't a bit of trouble in this house . " Now Marcus shrugged . " We both try to stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's side  --  I do n't give a damn what he does . Laura sides with Mother . " Was that a nasty note in his voice ? As though he were the weaker of the two , and resented it ? Will could n't be sure , and Marcus concealed any ill feeling with another nonchalant lift of his shoulders . " In any case , I do n't want Father 's behavior to spoili your visit . " Will thought of Laura 's shapely figure and angelic face iil and said : " Never . " Mr. Carnegie was n't present for supper ; Thurman Pennel said Carnegie had departed while the guests were refreshing themselves in their rooms . The main meal of the day had been eaten at noon , but supper was still a feast . It consisted of cuts of turkey and some other , more gamy fowl set out with a multitude of side dishes and a large selection of white wines and champagnes . The meal was served in a dining room so large and heavily hung with tapestries , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . Before the meal began , Marcus presented him to Mrs. Pennel . She was a small , curly-haired woman who seemed unusually shy . She murmured a word of welcome and then returned to her daughter 's side , as if she had nothing further to say , and  --  being married to a man as important and dominating as.Thurman Pennel  --  would have no right to utter it if she did . Will soon learned how mistaken he was in making that judgment . Marcus had warned him that relationships in the family were strained . As the supper commenced , he saw signs of that ; some were embarrassingly obvious . Thurman Pennel lurched along the sideboard , filling his  | plate from the dishes set out in the light of silver candlesticks . Pennel spooned up candied yams but missed his plate , depositing a large , glistening mass of food on the floor . Several of the young house guests noticed and pretended they had n't . Mrs. Pennel 's face grew stiff with disapproval . Pennel started to stagger on toward his place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife watching him . With a scowl , he squatted and picked up the sweet potato with the serving spoon which he then handed to a serving girl who hurried forward . Only then did he move on , his neck red . Will was watching Mrs. Pennel . No smile broke her sedate face . But he thought he detected a gleam of triumph in her eyes  --  particularly when she exchanged looks with Laura . To reach his assigned place between two of the house guests , Will had to circle Thurman Pennel 's chair at the head of the table . As he did , he again smelled gin . Pennel did n't try to sober up during supper . Instead , he drank a great deal of champagne . The moment his champagne glass was empty a servant refilled it and he started gulping again . Except for a certain slurring of his speech which had been evident earlier , he did n't act drunk . At least not until he called for everyone 's attention and told an off-color story that had no place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My dear  --  if you please , " was all she said when he finished , and that was said very softly . But Pennel had been tongue-lashed , and he and everyone else knew it . Pennel started to retort , looked at his wife and then at Laura and said nothing . He snapped his fingers . The servant with the champagne bottle rushed forward . Pennel pointed at his empty glass . While he drank , he again scrutinized his wife and daughter . Will was shocked to see the expression in the man 's dull brown eyes . Am I crazy , or does he hate both of them ? The young men and women at the table were minimally polite to Will . But it was clear that they felt awkward  --  in a couple of cases , irked  --  to have an outsider in their midst . He was just as uncomfortable , unable to make much sense of their conversation about someone 's yachting party last summer , or someone else 's recent victory in a lawn tennis  | match . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful and animated . Few remarks were addressed directly to Will . To those that were , he replied with a murmur , or a smile and a nod . He kept quiet for fear of making a fool of himself  --  then began to fear that his silence was creating precisely that impression . After the meal , he was thunderstruck when Laura walked straight to his side . She 'd barely spoken a word to him at the table . As Marcus led the group toward the music room , she took his arm : " I suppose you found all that social chatter frightfully boring , Mr. Kent . Your studies keep you occupied with matters ever so much more serious and important . " Was she mocking him ? He saw no sign . He wanted to jump up and click his heels ; he had n't come off as a clod after all . His shyness had been misinterpreted as intellectual boredom . He did n't intend to alter the impression : " I hate to admit it to a charming hostess , but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't easy to work yourself into a passion over lawn tennis . " " Doctors in training must see sights that are positively shocking . " A thoughtful pause ; he wanted to drain every drop of advantage from the situation . " On occasion . The real world is n't as sheltered and comfortable as Fennel House . " With difficulty , he framed a compliment . " By the way  --  I 've never seen anything quite so pretty as that outfit you 're wearing . " Marcus had kept the other guests moving . Will and Laura were momentarily isolated in a passageway designed to resemble an arched tunnel in a castle . Not too authentic a tunnel , though . Gas fixtures jutted from the walls ; some illuminated large , conventional landscapes in heavy gilt frames . " Ah , do you like it ? " Laura spun into a pirouette in the center of the passage . Will caught a flash of the toe of her shoe . Her skirt had no bustle , and fitted so snugly that he saw , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her buttocks . Unbearably erotic , somehow ? . She turned full circle , her cheeks flushed from wine . " Papa does n't like me to wear it . It 's the very latest  | thing , but he thinks anything from France is immoral . Imagine a judgment like that from someone like him ! Mama 's a modernist , though . She wants me to look up-todate . " Laura took his arm again . He felt the pressure of her breast against his sleeve . The contact was evidently unintentional . She drew away , turning still redder . A swift glance down the passage seemed to suggest she 'd let her emotions carry her away . But no one had seen them . Marcus and the other young people were trooping into the music room . Mrs. Pennel and her husband had disappeared as soon as the group left the dining room . " Mama probably struck you as a proper and dutiful wife , did n't she , Mr. Kent ? " He wondered what kind of answer she wanted . Not knowing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her say a word except when your father told that story . " " Was n't that dreadful ? The poor man simply ca n't control his tongue when he drinks . Sometimes he 's just impossible . " " Your mother acted with great restraint ? " " Do n't mistake that for a lack of backbone , Mr. Kent . Whatever you see in this house that pleases you  --  whatever you eat that you enjoy  --  be assured it 's all Mama 's doing . She even picks out Papa 's clothes . The only area in which she defers to him is in the choice of some of the paintings . " She nodded at one of the two canvases . " Papa still considers Thomas Cole and the rest of the Hudson River painters to be very advanced . He 's fifty years behind the times , but Mama humors him . I 'm afraid you wo n't find a Matthew Kent at Pennel House . Not while Papa 's alive , anyway . " " Oh , you know my uncle 's work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare call it ? His social life ? ? " Will grinned . " Try escapades . " She smiled too . " That does fit , does n't it ? Your uncle 's name pops up in the Saunterer 's column every now and then . " " The Saunterer , " Will repeated . " You must read Town Topics . "  | " Everyone in our set reads Town Topics . Do n't you ? " He shook his head . " My father wo n't allow it in the house . He says the Colonel is a blackmailer and a disgrace to journalism . " Will was referring to Colonel William d'Alton Mann , a raffish adventurer who 'd acquired the foundering weekly tabloid called Town Topics in 1885 . Mann had instantly converted it to the most scandal-packed paper in the na- rl tion . He piously claimed that his journalistic mission was to G , I improve the behavior of society by exposing immorality when and where he found it . Gideon had a different opinion . He said the ten- or twelve-page Saunterings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written by 111 Mann himself , was no instrument of moral reform but a blatant money-making device . Mann 's biggest income came from items left out of his paper . The Colonel kept a table at Delmonico 's Restaurant for the convenience of wealthy men to whom he 'd sent an ad-vance galley proof of some scandalous item concerning them , their wives , children , or mistresses . Usually the victim was willing , not to say eager , to pay to have the item omitted from the next edition . Once a week the Colonel received the supplicants  --  and the bribes  --  at his table , where he also managed to work in his favorite meal : six mutton chops , two heads of lettuce with a creamy dressing , a dozen biscuits , a huge portion of chocolate cake , two full bottles of champagne , and a cigar . " Deserves to be shot , " was Gideon 's opinion of the editor and publisher of Town Topics  --  which from time to time chronicled some of Matt Kent 's rowdy exploits at Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded , " I 'd say the Kent name is a familiar one in this household . " fIl He laughed . " Though not for the right reasons . " He indicated the paintings . " If your mother 's responsible for everything except the art in this house , she 's to be complimented . " " Thank you . In our set , a wife 's expected to take charge . The husband only appears to run things . The power really belongs to what the newspapers call the lioness . " " The what ? " 11 " Lioness , " she repeated with a dazzling smile . " I do n't  | know who first applied the term to women like Mama , but I think it 's rather appropriate . The male goes out to hunt for food while the female defends the home , tends the young , and disposes of whatever bounty the male dutifully brings back . The lioness runs everything . The limits of propriety are never exceeded because she sets those limits . You heard Mama speak to Papa when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered it , he thought . The rules in the Pennel household were clearly different from those under which Gideon and Julia operated . They treated their marriage as a partnership , not as a struggle for dominance between  --  God help him  --  carnivorous animals . Lioness struck Will as a ridiculous conceit . And yet Laura seemed taken with it . So taken , it made him uneasy . A new thought troubled him . By describing the Pennels ' relationship , was Laura also setting out the terms for any friendship she might develop with him ? His silence brought a frown to her face : " Do you disapprove of Mama speaking to Papa as she did ? Do you disapprove of a wife guiding her husband 's life in his best interests ? " Three of the young people appeared at the door of the music room , searching for them . One pointed : " Oh , there they are . " Will said , " I do n't think it 's my position to approve or disapprove , Miss Pennel . " Pink-faced over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , whispering : " I do wish you 'd call me Laura . " " Very well  --  Laura . I repeat , approval or disapproval is n't mine to give . I do n't move in the same circles as you do . " The others started calling for them to hurry so the caroling could start . Inside the music room , near a great candledecorated tree , Marcus was seated at a rosewood piano and was playing the opening notes of " Good King Wenceslas . " Laura turned so that the young people could n't see her touch his arm for a second : " You must n't downgrade yourself . Politics aside , your family is eminently respectable ? " " Respectable is not the same thing as belonging to your  | set , as you call it , " he replied with a wry smile . " Why , I 've never even been invited to Mrs. Astor 's January ball . " " But it could be arranged , " she said softly . Suddenly something in him rebelled ; he saw danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . lioness devoured . A lioness killed . He had no intention of being destroyed as Thurman Pennel had been . Laura 's father had obviously been stripped of his authority and selfrespect and driven to the arms of some shopgirl by the woman to whom he was married . Stiffly , he said , " I doubt it very much . The Kents do n't receive invitations at that level . My father once struck Ward McAllister. " 1I ' " Yes , I know that . But ? " " I 'd better say the rest , Miss Pennel . " " I thought it was Laura . " " We both know I 'm a guest at Pennel House only because Marcus and I got acquainted through mutual friends in Cambridge . " It was the lie they 'd agreed upon . " I 'm studying to be a doctor . That automatically puts my position in the world much lower than yours  --  as if it was n't lower to begin with . The Kent money is new money . My father 's a radical by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will ? Are you a radical by trade and temper-ament ? " " That makes no difference . " " It most certainly does . If the answer 's no , people in our set will accept you  --  even given your notorious profession . Actually , your profession might even help . It 's diverting to meet someone who uses his mind for more than the contemplation of a polo mallet or his own pedigree . People in my set respect intelligence so long as it is n't  --  what shall I say ? Radical . Dangerous . You give every indication that yours is not . There should be no limit to how high you can rise  --  if you have the right guidance . " She averted her eyes . " A wife with whom you share common goals ? " Marcus stopped playing and walked to the door . " Laura , will you kindly come along and bring your friend ? Or have you eloped ? " he added with a smirk . One of the girls gig-gled : " They 're whispering back there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that envy I detect , Charlotte dear ? " Laura called out ,  | her sweet tone not quite hiding her malice . Perhaps lioness was n't such a farfetched term after all . Like her mother , Laura was proper ; but she was also emotional , and quick to anger when she was threatened . " We 're coming , " she added , moving away from him . Over her shoulder she said , " I suppose we have held things up . But they can just wait for us . Are you bored with caroling now that Christmas is over ? " She gave him no chance to answer . " I am , dreadfully . I 'll see that Marcus cuts the singing short . " She glided on toward the music room . A smile stole onto Will 's face as he followed . She was a curious and complex girl . A girl of the very sort he 'd dreamed about . A girl who could help him keep his promise about the future . " I know you 'll be staying with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing back to see whether he was there ; she expected him to be . " Marcus and I have planned a great many activities for the group . You and I may not find another convenient opportunity to continue this discussion . We must do so when we see each other at some later time . " She added the last sentence as an afterthought , just before she made her entrance into the music room . She still did n't look back , but her meaning was unmistakable . She liked him . And if she continued to like him , she could and would take him where he could never go by himself . A man did n't succeed in her world without the right guidance . Nor without a wife with whom he shared common goals . Let the lioness rule unopposed , and everything was possible And they would continue the discussion of the possibilities when we see each other at some later time . Not if . When . He could n't understand his good fortune . She could have a hundred eligible bachelors waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason she 'd stated ? Because he was n't the sort of person she usually met in her crowd ? Whatever the explanation , he must n't question his luck . She was beautiful  --  and she could help him realize all of his ambitions " Will ? " He glanced up . She was standing in the doorway of the  | music room . She 'd spoken his name with an undertone of annoyance . " Are you or are you not planning to join us ? " she asked . He smiled . " Certainly . " Her own smile , hard as glass , rebuffed him because he 'd made her angry . She spun away : " Then do hurry along , unless you do n't enjoy our company . " She disappeared into the music room . Worried , he called , " I 'm coming , " and rushed after her . THE HOLIDAY AT Pennel House sped by . It did so despite the activities Will was forced to join in 11 merely to be near Laura . The mornings were n't bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the estate . But the afternoons and evenings were appalling . Following the main meal at midday , the group played inane parlor games such as wiggles and hunt-the-slipper . In the evenings , the young people sat with feigned expressions of interest while one of their number recited " Thanatopsis " or some other poem Will found equally sleep-inducing . When Will 's turn came , he said with a straight face that all he could recite from memory were passages from the fifth edition of Dr. Austin Flint 's Principles and Practice of Medicine . If that did n't sound suitable , he might manage some of Professor Shattuck 's observations on auscultation and percussion . No one was amused , least of all Laura . Her smile grew stiff as she stung him with a reproving glance . He did n't repeat the mistake . He also felt he 'd learned a valuable lesson . The Pennels ' set did n't appreciate humor ,  | unless it was the bawdy variety heard when the gentlemen left the ladies and retired to another room with their cigars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joke which implied disapproval of established customs or accepted ideas . Because Charles Darwin defied accepted thinking , he was the favorite conversational whipping boy of the young people . Arguing about Darwin 's theory of evolution was popular at Harvard , too ; Gideon called such argumentation the greatest intellectual craze of the century . The young people were quite opinionated on the subject , but Will was n't particularly surprised to find that none of them had read Darwin , and only he and Laura had read the sensationally popular , fictionalized version of the " ape or angel " debate , Stevenson 's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . It had been published the preceding year , and Gideon had negotiated to bring out an inexpensive reprint edition . Despite the demands of his course work , Will had read it twice . One evening at Pennel House , there was a welcome respite from things literary . Laura persuaded Marcus to play the piano in the ballroom , so the young people could dance . After a few minutes of intricate Virginia reels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paired off for more intimate waltzes and galops . Will was Laura 's only partner . The others seemed to understand that already . High above the ballroom floor , Marcus hunched over the piano in the musician 's gallery , smirking and puffing a cigarette as he played . He knew what his sister was up to , and was quite willing to cooperate . Thus , for a few delicious moments , Will was able to hold the soft blonde girl in his arms . As they whirled and turned , he could feel the heavy steel stays of her corset against his palm . Occasionally the lace ruching of her high , boned collar tickled his chin  --  an erotic sensation , somehow . He reveled in the nearness of her face . Her gray eyes were enhanced by the clarity and perfection of her pale skin . Being fashionable  --  and free of freckles that would need concealment  --  she did n't use cosmetics , save for a bit of rice powder and a touch of rouge so expertly applied , it  | might have been mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the most desirable creature he 'd ever met  --  and she knew he felt that way . He was overjoyed to realize there was a mutual attraction . She kept Marcus playing waltzes until he absolutely refused to run through 11 another . When the last dance ended , she gave Will 's hand a 1quick squeeze  --  the only real intimacy between them thus far . She might be willful , but he knew beyond any doubt that she was morally upright . She was the kind of girl Ili who would give herself only to the man she married . it Will had promised to be back in Boston to celebrate the New Year with Drew and some other classmates . His departure departure was set for early afternoon on the thirtieth . That morning , while servants packed his luggage , he planned to go on a sleigh ride with the others . He really did n't want to , but Laura was looking forward to it , so he did n't object . After breakfast , he dressed for the outdoors and strolled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , a senior at Yale , discussing trends in men 's clothes . " They say the howling swells over in Mayfair and Belgravia are definitely going back to trouser creases front and back , " Taylor remarked . " It 's the British Army influence . " Marcus sighed . " What 's next ? Creases on the side ? Cuffs ? " Taylor took him seriously . " Very possibly , old man . The Prince of Wales wore his trousers pressed four ways when he visited America in  --  oh , hello , Kent . All ready , I see . " Will nodded . He searched for Laura in the group just entering the foyer . She was at the back , brushing something from her sable muff . She did n't look at him . By now Will could recognize a deliberate delay . He was growing accustomed to Laura 's need to dominate any situation . As long as that need did n't conflict with anything he considered important , he 'd indulge her . Eagerly , in fact . Finally she smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shirt entered the foyer . He was carrying a large feather duster . Laura spoke sharply : " Jackson , where are you going ? " The man stopped . " The library , ma'am . Mrs. Pennel wants all the books dusted . She gave me full instructions before going out this morning . " " Be careful of the ladder when you do the top shelves .  | When it was delivered two weeks ago , I noticed it was none too sturdy . It came from a Scottish castle , you know . It ca n't be replaced . " " I shall exercise care , ma'am . " The man continued to the library , leaving the doors open behind him . Will frowned . He had trouble understanding a system of values which placed more importance on furniture than on the safety of a human being . There was a simple and cynical explanation , of course . Jackson was n't a human being , merely a servant . Laura joined Will as the group moved toward the front door . " And how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock formality , gazing up at him from beneath a little fur hat . He seemed to be drawn into those gray eyes as he answered : " Very happy to see you . And sorry I have to leave this afternoon . " " Well , we shall just have to make the most of the morn- " g " She slipped her arm through his . He felt the contour of her breast again . The others , especially the girls , noticed her minor infraction of the rules of propriety but said nothing . The young people trooped outside . The day was dark . The white lawns stretched away to woods that looked black under the heavy overcast . More snow was starting to fall . A pair of sleighs came gliding up the drive from the stables , the horses snorting and stepping smartly . The scene had a storybook quality ; the look of one of the immensely popular Currier and Ives lithographs . The girl accompanying Taylor made counting motions , then giggled : " Ten people for eight places . We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only ones who 'll be sardines , " Laura told her . " What do you mean ? " " The first sleigh holds five passengers . I 'll ride in the second one . I 'll sit on Will 's lap and risk being pilloried in Town Topics . That way there 'll be ample room for all . " The thought of that kind of intimate contact with Laura rekindled erotic feelings in Will . He had only a moment to anticipate the sleigh ride , though . From inside the house  | there suddenly came an anguished cry and a loud , prolonged crash . The sleighs pulled up , bells on the horses jingling . Behind the hiss of runners and the clop of hooves , he heard a second outcry . " Someone 's hurt . " He started away . She caught his arm : " The servants will see to it . " - " Maybe it 's something the servants ca n't handle . I should think you could wait five minutes without spoiling your ride . " His sharpness brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode into the foyer , melting snow glistening in his dark hair . Servants were hurrying to the site of the accident . As Will followed them , he heard the front door open behind him . Then Laura exclaimed : " Oh , it 's the library ! I warned that oaf to be careful . " The servant named Jackson lay in an awkward position on the library floor . Books and the broken pieces of the 1 " ladder were strewn on the carpet all around him . Midway between his left knee and ankle , something white and sharp stuck out through a bloody rip in his trousers . " Stand back and let me examine him , " Will said as he hurried forward . The servants quickly gave him room . He knelt , studying but not touching the leg from which the bone protruded . Jackson was a man of about fifty . He gazed at Will with apprehensive eyes and tried to change position . The effort made him groan and squeeze his eyes shut . Tears trickled down his cheeks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A servant ran past Marcus and disappeared into the foyer . All the guests were trooping back into the library now . One of the girls complained about the delay . Jackson again tried to move ; he clenched his teeth and uttered another groan . " Try to relax and lie quietly , " Will said . " I know it hurts . "  | " Hurts  --  is n't the word for it , " Jackson gasped . " I 'll snip that pants leg off for a better look . " The scissors arrived . He cut slowly and carefully , fearful of a mistake . Two fragments of bone , not just one , jutted through the bloody tear in the skin . " An open tibial fracture ? " he began as Laura walked up next to him : " I 'm sure Charlie Brassman can handle it . I 've sent for him . " " Who 's Charlie Brassman ? " " One of our grooms . " Disgusted , Will stood up . " This man needs help from someone who treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie Brassman 's perfectly competent ! " " I still prefer to take care of this myself . " " Very well , " she said , her voice pitched low . " But if you do , you 'll make me extremely unhappy . " " Good God , Laura , that 's an unreasonable ? " " Please do n't curse . There is no need for theatrics . Charlie Brassman ? " " Someone send for me ? " Heads turned . A small , shabbily dressed man bustled into the library . He touched a knuckle to his forehead , and Will noticed that he had hands like wrinkled hide . " Miss Laura  --  Mister Marcus , " Brassman said , nodding a greeting . Then he looked down . " What 's this , what 's this ? Ai n't you a sight , Jackie ! What the devil did you do to yourself ? " He dropped to his knees beside the injured man . Jackson eyed him with fright and distrust . Laura tugged Will 's arm : " Everything 's under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anger Laura . Did n't want to risk an abrupt end to a friendship so well begun ; a friendship with so many auspicious possibilities for the future His hesitation annoyed her . Smiling , she slipped her arm in his and lashed him with her soft voice : " I insist . " Will turned away from Jackson 's imploring gaze . His shoulders slumped . " All right , " he said .  | Taylor , the Yale man , pursed his lips . " I 'm thankful the ride wo n't be delayed any further . " He led the others back to the foyer . Will was moving toward the library door , Laura clinging to him , when the groom clucked his tongue and said : " We 'll have to set this , Jackie . " In a terrified voice , Jackson breathed , " Be careful , wo n't you ? It hurts like sin . Go easy . " " Sure , sure . Leave me take a closer look . " Will and Laura had just reached the foyer when Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising echoes of the cries of Chris Tompkins the night he died . Echoes of the little gray , Boston , bellowing and slamming his head on the ground in the glare of the lightning A few words about your duties . Laura gasped as he took hold of her hand and lifted it . away from his arm . Then he pivoted and walked back toward Charlie Brass .. man . He knew his decision would probably cost him dearly , but he could n't help it . He could n't silence his conscience any longer . Brassman had both hands fastened on Jackson 's bleeding leg . Livid , Will said , " You 're not treating a horse . Let go of him . " Scowling , the groom obeyed . Jackson gasped with relief . " I thought you were competent , " Will said to Brassman . " Do n't you know better than to maul him when you have n't given him anything for the pain ? " The groom was indignant . " You 're an expert , are you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Harvard boy : Someone did tell me you was visiting here . Well , doctor , I 'm mighty sorry to inform you that we ai n't got any spirits of ether sittin ' around the house . " " I assume you have brandy . Get some . " The groom hesitated , his surly eyes communicating his instantaneous dislike of the younger man . The delay infuriated Will . He took a step toward the groom :  | " Go ! " Brassman muttered something and stormed out . Trying to ignore the stony look on Laura 's face , Will looked at the others . Only Marcus , who was leaning against the library door at the back of the crowd , looked sympathetic . Behind him , Will heard Jackson 's rough breathing as he said : " The rest of you go enjoy the ride while I look after Mr. Jackson . I 'll send Brassman for anything I need . " Laura fixed him with those imperious gray eyes . A smile slowly curved her mouth . An executioner 's smile , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was as cold as the winter day : " Yes , let 's go enjoy ourselves while Mr. Kent does his humanitarian duty . Come along , now . Come along ? " She spread her arms and herded the others into the foyer without a single backward glance . Will ran a hand through his hair , listening to the merry voices as the young people hoarded the sleighs . The drivers whipped up the horses . The voices and the tinkling sleigh bells began to fade . He looked down at Jackson , who said , " Sorry  --  if I ? ruined the outing for you , sir . Did n't  --  mean to fall . Damned ladder just  --  broke apart under me . " Will waved . " Never mind . " His thoughts were less forgiving : The outing is n't all you ruined , my friend . WHEN BRASSMAN RETURNED with a decanter of brandy , he met Will in the foyer . Will had been in the kitchen , scrubbing his hands with strong yellow soap . His coat was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groom to precede him , then used the heel of his boot to close the library doors . Brassman poured some brandy down Jackson 's throat . Will touched nothing I in the room or on the patient until he started to work . It took him forty minutes to reduce the fracture , close the wound and suture it with seven stitches , each put in place with straight needles Brassman found in the sewing uIhi , room . Will kept the groom busy ; he proved to be a competent if disgruntled helper . All seven needles were first boiled in the kitchen , then soaked in brandy and brought to the library on a clean towel . At the prick of the first needle , Jackson 's eyes rolled up in his head . He 'd borne a good deal of pain , but he could n't deal with the thought , sight , or feel of a steel sewing needle piercing his skin . He fainted . One by one , Will aligned and inserted the seven needles through the edges of the wound , exactly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To each needle he attached a strand of boiled cotton thread ; the heaviest Brassman had been able to find . When all the needles were in place , he went back to the first , pulled it through and tied the thread . Then he finished the second stitch in similar fashion , and so on until the wound was closed . Brassman soaked up the excess blood with wads of cotton . During the entire procedure , Will fought off a pervading certainty that he was n't doing things according to the instructions he 'd received in class . The lack of confidence persisted until the last suture was tied off and he stepped back , gloomily wondering how he 'd behave when confronted with his first major surgical procedure . Perhaps he 'd never even start it for fear of botching it . He passed a hand across Jackson 's brow . The man 's skin II was clammy but cool . He was breathing satisfactorily . Will walked to a chair , sat down , and put his palms against his eyes , letting his tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Brassman to bring in the old-fashioned fracture box he had sawed and hammered together out of scrap lumber , following a crude sketch Will had provided . " A good job , " Will said as he examined the hinged sides of the box . " Doubly good considering the short time you  | had to make it . Where 's the young lady who volunteered to take care of Mr. Jackson ? " " Said she 'd be right along . " " Did you explain that the care entails extra work for seven , possibly eight weeks ? It 'll take at least that long for the fracture to mend . And Dr. Barton 's bran treatment has to be carried out faithfully , every day . " " I explained , " Brassman told him , smirking . " She do n't mind the work . She 's sweet on Jackie . " Soon the subject of the discussion , a homely maid named Nell , appeared . She was carrying linen Will had requested because there was no gauze in the house . As Will dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a slate with a piece of chalk . " A new dressing once a day , " Will said to her . " Wet it here  --  here  --  and here with a five percent carbolic acid solution . Have an apothecary prepare the solution so it is n't ten or fifteen percent . When you apply it , do so sparingly . Lister himself is n't using the stuff as freely as he once did . He used to cover an entire operative field with carbolic mist sprayed continuously from a steam atomizer . Now there 's speculation that too much carbolic may injure tissues . So be careful . " The maid nodded , although Will suspected she had grasped little of what he 'd just said . " Now we 'll position Jackson 's leg in the fracture box . Watch how I do it . The foot must be tied to the end board exactly the way I 'm going to show you . " Nell asked no questions , so when he was finished , he checked the slate to make sure she 'd written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack the box with fresh bran once a day . " Good . " Will wiped his hands on a towel . " The bran will absorb any discharge from the wound and help keep the dressing dry . Dr. Barton 's treatment is an old one , but it 's very good and still very popular  --  oh , by the way . Replace the linen as soon as you can find gauze . " " Yes , sir . " Will rolled down his sleeves and took out his pocket watch . More time had passed than he 'd realized . Soon he 'd have to be on his way to the railway station . Jackson was awake again . He 'd listened to most of Will 's instructions . Though obviously in pain and still intoxicated ,  | he managed to mumble a garbled thank-you to the man who had helped him . Will appreciated the thanks . He took satisfaction from having done his job with reasonable competence . Yet the satisfaction could n't offset a larger disappointment he was experiencing now that his mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his coat , he was conscious of the stillness of the house . Laura and her friends were still out in the Pi sleighs , having a fine time . As he walked out of the library , he realized the carriage would probably leave for the depot II before Laura returned . He would n't see her  --  not today or ever again , thanks to what he 'd done . That was bitter medicine . " Will ? " Astonished by the voice , he looked toward the doors to . ' . the living hall . " Laura ! " She hurried toward him . The silken dust ruffle inside the hem of her skirt showed briefly , a pale froth . Her stride , and her determined expression , kept Will from smiling to show his delight . She 'd taken off her fur hat and muff but still wore her fur-trimmed jacket , which was much too heavy for indoors . Perhaps that accounted for her flushed look . That , or anger . " I thought you were with the others ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . I thought it was more important to stay and speak with you . Please come outside so we wo n't be overheard . " " But it 's snowing hard out ? " " Please come outside . " This time he did n't argue . He was overjoyed at seeing her again , and anxious to know what had put such intensity in her voice .  | He followed her out the front door , down the steps , and around toward the east side of the mansion . She seemed unconcerned about the snow , although it stuck in her hair , melted , and ruined her coiffure . She stopped under a large window consisting of pieces of red , orange , and yellow stained glass arranged to represent a sunset . Gaslight inside cast a bloody glow on the white ground , and on Will and Laura as they faced one another . " You quite spoiled my morning , Will Kent . " Anger flared again . " I 'm very sorry . A man needed help . " " I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christ , that 's charitable of you ! " The force of that made her blink and step back . All at once , gazing at her through the curtain of the snow , he was again struck by her incredible beauty . His rage moderated . He even tried to excuse her behavior by telling himself that no one was perfect : everyone 's character  --  his own included  --  had objectionable aspects . Laura , too , seemed in a gentler , more conciliatory mood all at once . Her gray eyes softened as she and Will stood gazing at one another in the falling snow . She moved closer again : " I do n't want to quarrel with you , Will . It 's forward of me to say this  --  altogether improper , but I ? " She looked away . " I 've been taken with you since the moment Marcus first mentioned your name and what you did . You 're ever so much more interesting and  --  well  --  substantial than the drones he usually brings home . " Will 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quarrel either . " A sheepish smile . " And I owe you an apology for swearing again . " " No you do n't . In the library , I said what I did because I thought the others were listening . I disapproved of your profanity for the sake of appearances , that 's all . You 've no idea how important appearances can be in our circle . I 'll have to impress that on you if we continue seeing one another . "  | Not when . If . Was her turn of phrase intentional or acci- 1 ; dental ? He 'd better find out : " I thought that my decision to help Jackson made it certain that we would n't see each other . " " Not quite . I like you , Will . I decided one indiscretion i was forgivable  --  if we could strike a bargain . I admire your idealism , but it must be channeled , my dear . Kept within Fi practical limits . " He thought of their earlier conversation . Of the image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact controlled everything he did . She laid a hand on his arm . " My proposition 's a very straightforward one . If we permit our friendship to ripen ? and ii I hope we can  --  this morning must be the first and last I I , time you ever leave my side to do your horse doctoring . " " Horse ? " Stunned , he could n't go on . It took him a moment to recover and say , " You still do n't understand . That man Jackson ? " " Is the kind of patient who is not worthy of your attention . You squander your talent and your energy when you deal with people of his station . It 's beneath you ! What 's worse , if you continue with that kind of work , you 'll soon give everyone the idea that you want to do nothing else . That you 're capable of nothing else . " How icily calculating that sounded . She was concerned , with subtleties of which he was n't even aware . How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mother flashed into his mind . A modest , retiring woman . Deceptively so . " My dear  --  if you please . " She ruled her husband , and she 'd evidently taught her daughter all her skills . Until this moment , he had n't quite believed the word lioness was appropriate , but at last he did . Laura . was saying , " If you 'll just realize that the impression you create is every bit as important as your actual ability , you can be a very successful doctor . Prosperous . Prominent , too . " He smiled , surprised . " I ca n't imagine that you 'd be interested in the medical profession . " She touched her upper lip to flick away a flake of melting snow . " I am because you are . When Marcus first described you , Papa made disparaging remarks about ' ,  | doctors . He said they were undistinguished and povertystricken . That is n't true , is it ? " " Not for all of them . Some do exceptionally well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few friends in the right places . " " Do you mean sponsors ? Patron families who help them establish a practice ? " " Yes . " Her gray eyes seemed to bore through him . " Sponsors such as the Pennels , for example ? " He nodded , trying to soften the strange , almost uncomfortable intensity of the moment by smiling again . He had a curious feeling that she knew much more about his chosen profession than she admitted . Had she been asking questions ? If so , why ? He could only find one explanation ; but it was one which pleased him . She felt a physical attraction as strong as his . He saw it in the scarlet lights glowing in her eyes . She wanted him the way he wanted her Of course that could only come with marriage . But she seemed to be hinting that it surely would come if he obeyed the rules . Her rules . But would that be so hard to accept if she took him where he wanted to go ? He decided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unexpected . After a swift glance over her shoulder , she put her hands on his upper arms and held him , tightly : " I 'm afraid I 'm quite taken with you , Mr. Kent . I do n't know exactly how it happened , or whether it 's wise . But they say the heart is seldom wise . Still  --  there are terms . If you ca n't agree to them , I 'll feel terribly brokenhearted , but I imagine I 'll survive . So tell me , my dear . Do you want to see me again ? " He was almost giddy with happiness . And yet , in a remote corner of his mind , some small voice protested that her performance was too perfect to be sincere . She could n't possibly care for him as she said she did Or was that only his sense of inferiority trying to rob him of happiness by telling him he was n't worthy of it ? She stood on tiptoe . No one would see ; the storm was intensifying , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness . The swirling snow blurred the  | limestone wall of the house just a few feet away , and bleached the red light falling through the window . " Do you want to see me again ? " she repeated , her mouth only an inch or two from his . He thought of the Vanderbilt mansion . Of Vlandingham ordering luncheon in French . He thought of Carter . Then he heard Roosevelt speaking from the sundrenched platform in Dickinson . He fought to banish the memory . Emotion and ambition struggled with conscience and slowly , slowly overcame it " Very much , " he said . " Then you must promise me that you 've done your horse doctoring for the last time . " He hesitated only a moment : " For the last time . Ipromise . " She flung her arm around his neck . She raised her face IH and body and kissed him , opening her mouth for a moment to let him savor the delicious promise of her tongue . Then she withdrew , patting her hair and whispering , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it with any other boy . I could n't help myself . Do n't think less of me . " Tumid with excitement , he tried to speak calmly : " No , I do n't , I could n't . Ever . " Laura squeezed his hand . She looked much older than her nineteen years as she smiled and said , " We 'd better go back inside before we freeze . " Without waiting for agreement , she swept past him , her shoes crunching in the deepening snow and her skirt leaving a trail . She kept her hand in his , leading him . Since he was a step behind , it was impossible for him to i see her face . Impossible for him to see her shut her eyes , as if immensely relieved about something ; impossible for him to see the joy and satisfaction that flooded into those same eyes a moment later ; impossible for him to see the smile that curled her mouth . It was a satisfied smile , as if a plan had been carried to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OTHER WEEKEND during the early months of 1888 , Will took the train to New York City to visit Laura . The Pennels ' city residence was an opulent mansion located on the east side of Fifth Avenue above Fifty-second Street . They had formerly owned another place downtown , near Madison Square , but had sold it when the area began to decline . Will found it a good omen that their present home was within hailing distance of the William K.Vanderbilt chateau that held such significance for him . Laura always had the weekends completely planned by the time he arrived . They watched Gilbert and Sullivan operettas from the Pennel box at the Standard Theatre ; went sailing on Long Island Sound with friends of her and Marcus as soon as the weather grew warm enough ; attended a number of subscription balls for which Will was forced to buy complete formal dress . He did n't care much for the people he met at these weekend outings . Young or old , they seemed a selfcentered , snobbish lot . But he learned to hide his feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like his patients in order to profit from their illnesses . Whenever he spoke to Thurman Pennel , he never discussed politics , or mentioned his father . It was soon evident that his restraint improved his standing with Mr. Pennel . He assumed Mrs. Pennel already approved of him ; otherwise he would n't have been permitted to court her daughter . His uneasiness about lacking social graces began to disappear . Laura was free with advice on everything from proper manners to the proper attire for each hour of the day . Anxious to learn , he took the advice with good grace .  | Soon he found that he could wear his evening clothes with no sense of awkwardness , and could carry on trivial conversations with Laura 's friends and not fret about whether his next word would be the correct one . Memories of his mother seldom bothered him . Thurman Pennel had a stream of callers that spring . He was deeply involved in an effort to remove Grover Cleveland from the White House . One of the visitors was a portly but vigorous-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marcus were invited to meet him , he was still venting his fury over the President 's tariff message the previous December : " A body blow to every single native manufacturer ! Let England take care IE'F of herself  --  and in God 's name let Americans look after y " America ! " Laura 's father was even less restrained when criticizing Cleveland . " Marxist " was perhaps the kindest term he used . If there had been any doubt about the chief executive 's radical leanings , Pennel declared , his signature on the Interstate Commerce Act the preceding year had removed it . Of course Cleveland quibbled and said he was " suspicious " of the new legislation . " But the blackguard signed it ! " Pennel roared . " It 's nothing less than a shameless attack on the business com-munity ! " The purpose of the new law was to regulate the railroad combinations , those lines which got together to fix rates among themselves . The practice resulted in rebates for volume customers of the cooperating railroads , and exorbitant rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who moved their crops to market by rail . Under the new law , all discriminatory rates were forbidden , and I the railroads were required to file tariff schedules with the , newly created Interstate Commerce Commission . Pennel deemed the whole thing an assault on American liberty , and predicted the decay of personal incentive and the collapse of the country unless the Republicans elected a man who was pro-business and pro-tariff . Senator Benjamin Harrison , grandson of the ninth president , was a name mentioned in Will 's hearing . In the late spring , Will and Drew prepared for year-end examinations . Drew was anxiously awaiting answers to letters he 'd sent a month earlier . He was hoping to find a  | volunteer medical post for the summer , one in which he could gain some practical experience . Two weeks before the examinations , Will again traveled to New York . He hated to take time from his studies but the Pennels  --  minus the head of the household  --  were about to sail for three months of sightseeing on the Continent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastor 's variety theater , then to supper at Delmonico 's . On the way home in a hired carriage whose driver had been instructed to go slowly , she permitted Will to touch her breast while they kissed , and even put her own hand over his to increase the pressure . When they broke the embrace , she apologized for letting her emotions overwhelm her sense of propriety . He laughed and told her he did n't mind a bit . Her ardor encouraged him to say what he 'd been thinking all eve-ning : " I do n't know how I 'll survive the summer without you . " " Nor I , my dear . " Another moment of hesitation . Then : " I love you , Laura . " " Oh , my sweet boy One arm curled around his neck . She pressed her cheek against his , her eyes closing . Her voice was husky with emotion : " I feel the same way . I know it 's wrong , but when I 'm with you , I want to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly as Aggie at Madam Melba 's , she reached down and grasped him . Her hand , working and working , almost drove him crazy . She moaned softly . It would have been so easy to hire a cheap hotel room for an hour But he could n't ask that of her . A man who respected a girl had a responsibility to help her maintain her honor . Old-fashioned as that might be , he still believed it . He moved just slightly . She understood the signal and , with a small , disappointed sigh , let go . " Will , I 'm so terribly sorry . I got carried away all-over again . It 's never happened with anyone but you . " " I 'm glad . " After a pause he blurted , " I want to marry you , Laura . "  | He was terrified that she 'd laugh . But all she did was hug him and whisper : " When , my darling ? " " In two years . As soon as I 've gotten my degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that long . But I 'll try . In case you do n't know it , Will Kent , I think you 're a perfectly splendid catch . We 're going to turn you into one of the finest , richest doctors in all of New York . In the whole country ! It 's about time the Pennels had a member of the family who can claim some intellectual accomplishment . " Is that what I 'm to be ? A family trophy ? But what was wrong with that ? he asked himself a moment later . The kind of plan she described would give him everything he wanted ; absolutely everything . He 'd have no worries for the rest of his life He gathered her into his arms and kissed her again . The carriage creaked slowly on toward upper Fifth Avenue . Will saw the Pennels off at the North German Lloyd 's pier , then returned to Boston , where his father made some disparaging remarks about his fondness for his new-found friends . Will was too much in love to let the sarcasm bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . In the wake of Theo Payne 's death , four successive editors had been hired to take charge of the Union . Each had been found wanting . While the search continued , circulation fell steadily . Gideon was growing desperate . " I have only one more possibility , " he said to Julia . " An editor on the night desk of the World . His name 's Moultrie Calhoun . I 've heard he 's unhappy , so I 'm going to write him a letter and ask him to have dinner . I do n't like raiding a competitor  --  not even one like Joe Pulitzer  --  but if I must go raiding , I will . And I must say Joe 's reputation gets worse by the week . I hardly ever agree with him anymore , and everyone on Park Row says his nervous disorders are making him almost too irascible to deal with . I 'm not surprised Calhoun wants to leave . " Will and Drew continued to cram for their examinations . Two days before the first test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an assistant at the medical inspection station at Castle Garden in New York . Castle Garden was the entry point for the hundreds of thousands of European immigrants swarming to the United States . The press regularly predicted that by the time the decade was over , the total number of arrivals for the ten-year period might reach five million  --  much to the disgust of established families such as the Pennels . Both young men passed their examinations , thus advancing to the third class . Drew left Boston and a few weeks later wrote from New York to invite Will to come for a visit . The idea was appealing . Will was bored reading medical texts , and it would be some weeks before he began his studies in Dr. Charles Green 's special summer course in obstetrics . Until very recently , medical students had n't been permitted to witness childbirth ; that was the province of the midwife . Also , questions of the patient 's modesty were involved . The only obstetrical training most doctors received came from lectures or study of anatomical models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every third-year student attend at least two cases of labor before receiving a diploma . Dr. Green 's short course was intended as preparation . In late July , Will boarded a train for New York . Castle Garden , a huge building with a conical roof , was located at the upper west end of Battery Park . The structure dated from 1807 . It had been planned as a fort to defend lower Manhattan , but that use had been found impractical  --  as had its second function as a site for public entertainment . Although Jenny Lind had packed Castle Garden during her Barnum-sponsored concert tour in 1850 , the building 's shed-like design was simply all wrong for a music hall . Finally it had been leased to the Commissioners of Emigration . Will reached sprawling Battery Park on a hot , humid morning . The hazy air all but hid the Jersey shore , and blurred the hull and superstructure of a rusty ocean-going vessel moving slowly up the river . As Will watched , the  | ship came to a dead stop . Tugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain paid out noisily . At 1,1 the ship 's rail stood a couple of hundred men and women . 11 Some held up infants , presumably hoping the babies would appreciate the heat-sodden skyline , or the huge copper-clad figure of Liberty out in the harbor . Bartholdi 's gigantic statue with its flaring lamp upraised had finally been erected on its pedestal late in 1886 . Small excursion boats took sightseers a mile and a half out to Bedloe 's Island for a closer inspection . Will thought he should make that one 1 of his stops before he returned to Boston . He was fascinated by a group of about twenty men , most of them unsavory looking , who lounged near the gates of Castle Garden . As the new arrivals emerged from the 161 , building , bundles of belongings slung over their shoulders and bewildered expressions on their faces , the waiting men took advantage of that bewilderment . From the shadow of the park 's bandstand , Will watched one of the men step up to an elderly couple , smile and tip his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign tongue . Russian , perhaps ; he could n't be sure . The old man and woman broke out in smiles at the sound of a familiar language . The man  --  a hard-faced sort " I ' with a large diamond ring on the little finger of his right hand  --  noticed Will watching and glared . Will moved on . The man stepped between the elderly couple and began talking in a confidential tone . Another white-haired man came through the gates , a homemade crutch under his left arm . A laughing eightyear-old boy rode his right shoulder . Next came the boy 's parents  --  a big-shouldered man in ragged clothes , and a buxom , extremely ugly girl who was entranced by the sights around her . A man broke away from the loungers and sauntered toward the group : " Good morning to you . Would you be interested in halfprice railroad tickets to your destination ? " The grandfather said something in a foreign language to indicate that he did n't understand . He asked a question . The American grinned : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . My folks ti 11 spoke nothing else . " He proceeded to prove it , slipping his arms around the young couple as if he 'd known them for years . The parents ,  | the old man , and the child all looked at the stranger with expressions of trust and gratitude . At the gates , Will sent in his name ; he 'd have to wait until Drew came for him . The guard , a florid Irishman , told him no one was allowed to leave without a permit ? and no one was allowed to enter without being vouched for by an employee : " Otherwise we 'd have the damned rascals inside the building too . " He indicated the lounging men who were laughing and talking with one another . " As it is , they pollute this place day and night . They pay off the police so they wo n't be run in for their dirty tricks . We try to warn the greenhorns . And there 's a currency exchange inside where they can get an honest shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most of ' ' em are tired and so nervous , they do n't get around to doing business till they meet their new-found friends out here . Disgusting , that 's what it is ! " Will pointed at the family he 'd observed : " I heard that man mention cut-rate railroad tickets to those four . " " Oh , sure , he 'll sell them a half-price ticket to Minnesota or Kansas or anyplace else they want to go . Only they wo n't be able to read it and see it 's worthless . The sharps either speak a foreign language or learn enough of a few to get by . These are the very first Americans the greenhorns meet outside of Castle Garden . What a fine impression of our country it must give them ! " The guard glowered at the men . " Will ! " He turned at the sound of the familiar voice . There came Drew , a spotted linen smock flying around his legs . The heat plastered his red-gold curls to his pale forehead . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . " So you 've seen our version of John , chapter two . " " What ? " " The temple of the moneychangers that Jesus purged . I wish someone would purge Battery Park . " " I was watching some of those men operate . They 're very skillful . " " Skillful crooks ! They all have their specialties . Some only watch for prosperous immigrants . They buy them a meal , drug their drinks  --  and the newcomers wake up in  | some alley , prosperous no longer . Some of the men concentrate on befriending young girls traveling alone  --  you can imagine where they wind up . By the way  --  Jo sends you her regards . " The thought of Drew 's sister brought a look of embarrassment to Will 's face . " I have n't had time to answer her letters for months . " A wry smile . " Do you suppose that 's why she stopped writing ? " " That and the fact that she 's seeing a boy . " 1 " Oh ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to tears , but at least she has a suitor of whom Pa approves . She 's filled out a lot . I 've never seen anyone so grateful to be grown up . " " You said you hoped she 'd be less grumpy when that happened . " " My hope has been fulfilled . Now she 's only grumpy when she looks in the mailbox and finds you have n't sent a letter . You 're still her favorite . " Will wished Jo Hastings would grow out of her adolescent devotion to him ; he hoped Drew had n't told her about Laura . " Is Jo working at the store ? " he asked . " Six days a week . " Drew led his friend into the building and down a dark corridor ten degrees hotter than the outdoors . " Is she happy ? " " I " think she 's miserable . She 'll never get over the fact that she ca n't realize her ambition because we 're poor and she 's a girl . She sympathizes with Pa 's predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of it . " He and Will entered a small office . Drew took Will 's valise , then reached toward a wall peg . He handed his friend a heavy linen smock of the kind he was wearing : " Put this on , if you do n't mind . We have a patient . " " We ? " " Yes , I need your help . " " What about the regular doctors ? " " Too busy . I do n't know whether I wrote you about the procedure here . " " No . " " Arriving ships anchor in the river ? " Will nodded . " I watched a big one putting her anchor down . "  | " They stay in the river while a Customs House launch takes the immigrants off in groups . We 'll be receiving that ship 's first load within the hour . A vessel that came in earlier this morning brought us two hundred and fifty , including our patient . " " Who is he ? " " She , " Drew corrected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , but she 's very much pregnant . At full term , in fact . Some of the others on her boat spoke a little English . They say this is her first child . She 's been in labor about twenty-six hours . Too long . Her pains have stayed steady and strong , but the baby 's progress has stopped . " " The fetus in the wrong position ? " " Yes . Almost a direct posterior position , as far as I can tell . " " Was n't there a doctor aboard her ship ? " " No . " " Could n't someone in the crew have helped her ? " " Medical care is n't included when you buy a steerage ticket , Will . " " All Tight , but how 'd she become your responsibility ? " " The captain ordered her off , and never mind her condition . An orderly 's watching her in case there 's an emergency , but I 've delayed about as long as I can . I 'm going to have to deliver her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me only routine examinations were done at Castle Garden . " " That 's right . Serious cases are transferred to the hospital on Ward 's Island . I do n't believe I have time to ship this girl there . " He shoved the smock at Will . " Drew , I 've never seen a delivery ! I have n't even had a course in ? " " Neither have I , for God 's sake . But we 've both read textbooks  --  and last summer in Hartford , I paid an old midwife to let me watch half a dozen accouchements . I had to pretend to be her son . Some women are insane on the subject of modesty . They 'd rather perish than have a physician see their private parts . Anyway , for three of the deliveries , the old woman had to use the forceps . Years ago she hired a blacksmith to make some to her specifications . She was masterful with them . I learned a lot watching her . Now come on  --  enough conversation . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . "  | The old sense of inadequacy gripped Will then : " I 'm not sure I 'm capable of being any real hel ? " " You can administer ether , ca n't you ? I 'll even tell you how many spoonfuls to sprinkle into the inhaler . " The contempt reddened Will 's cheeks . But he still did n't move . Drew cast an anxious eye on a small desk clock . " Now what 's wrong ? Do you object because the girl 's poor and foreign ? Do you only associate with rich patients now that you 've taken up with the Pennels ? " " That 's goddamn unfair , Drew ! " " Of course it is . But it got a reaction . " " For your information , I do n't need to be told how many spoonfuls of ether to sprinkle into the inhaler . I memorized a few things besides the tenth edition of Gray 's ! " " That was my impression , " Drew said with a mocking lift of his eyebrows . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smock from Drew 's hand , flung it on a chair and started to strip off his coat . Drew 's quick smile could n't quite hide his tension . IN A SMALL , badly lighted room bearing no resemblance to a modem surgical theater , Drew examined a rectangular table with a large brown stain in the center . Two blocks of rough wood had been nailed to the corners of the table nearest him . He touched each block , then spun to the loutish young orderly in the filthy white jacket : " Could n't you find wood without splinters , Clarence ? " The orderly acted as if the question insulted him . " No , I could n't . " Drew pointed to the blocks . " Then cover these with  | cloths soaked in the carbolic solution . Put a sheet soaked in carbolic over the whole table , and two dry ones on top . Where 's the girl ? " " On my gurney , down the hall . " " We 'll bring her in after we fix the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fast , for Christ 's sake ! " Drew shouted . " I 'd like to deliver the child sometime before the leaves fall ! " The orderly moved a little faster . The door slammed . Drew sighed . " Should n't have yelled at him . I 'll need his help , too . Damn heat 's getting me . " The heat , and the problem confronting them , Will thought as he studied the room . For a moment the only sound was the faint bubbling of a kettle of water boiling on a ring above a gas burner . Drew noticed his friend 's frown and said : " We 're splendidly set up , are n't we ? No windows . No separate ventilated room for administering the anesthetic . You 'll have to do it right in here . " He cocked an eye at the gas fixture hanging above the table , its jets trimmed low . " Be careful with the ether . Blowing the fetus into the world is n't the procedure I had in mind . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little we have . " Will moved to an old walnut cabinet . " You sound nervous . " " Why , no , " . his friend replied as he pulled a book , then a forceps , from storage cubbies . " I always keep a text handy when I work . It reassures the patient . If the doctor does n't know what the hell to do next , perhaps the author does . " Less sarcastically , he continued , " I really am glad you 're here . I would n't trust Clarence to give the anesthetic . I did n't tell you all the complications . The fetus is extremely large . And the mother 's pelvis is all wrong for childbearing . It 's the truncated kind  --  more like a man 's than a woman 's . Add my inexperience and you might logically conclude that the whole business is very chancy . Your conclusion would be right . "  | Drew poured some of the boiling water into a smaller basin uext to a second one containing carbolic solution . Will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small table . He noted the title of the book Drew planned to keep handy . A System of Midwifery . It was a widely used text by Dr. Leishman of the University of Glasgow . Clarence returned with sheets and rags . Will and Drew took over preparation of the table . After it was draped , Drew tore strips of clean rag with which to tie the patient 's ankles to the blocks once her heels were braced against them . Next Drew washed his hands in the smaller basin of boiled water , relatively cool now . Once he 'd rinsed off the soap he dipped his hands and lower arms into the adjacent pan of carbolic solution . The room was intensely hot . Will asked about dispensing with the smocks . " I prefer them , but I suppose we can . " Will got rid of his , rolled up his sleeves and drained the dirty water from the small basin . He rinsed and refilled it , then washed his hands and immersed them in the basin of antiseptic . Drew , meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forceps . Each half of forged metal consisted of a long shank with a handgrip at one end and , at the other , a blade somewhat resembling a large serving spoon from which most of the bottom had been cut out . Holding each shank at the mid-point , Clarence dipped the handles into the kettle of boiling water , then into the carbolic . Drew waited a few seconds to permit the handles to cool and took them in his own hands . He studied the two halves of the forceps . They were meant to be united by an attachment mechanism near the mid-point of the shanks . When fitted together , the halves formed a single instrument with the concave surfaces of the blades facing inward for holding and judiciously pulling the head of the fetus . The design of the attachment mechanism allowed the two halves to slide forward or back ; necessary for adjusting to irregularities in the shape of the fetus '  | head . In a posterior-position fetus , such irregularities were to be expected . As Drew stared at the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories he 'd heard at Harvard ; stories of infants marked or mangled before birth by doctors whose handling of the forceps was unskillful . Will started to feel an ache in the pit of his stom- ' ach , and a sense of concern and responsibility for the unknown mother that he did n't altogether welcome . Drew immersed the unsterilized sections of the forceps in the boiling water , then the carbolic . At the same time , Will was sorting and arranging the apparatus for administering anesthesia : a battered metal Allis inhaler ; a Goodwillie mouth gag for holding the jaws apart ; a tenaculum to draw out the tongue , and a large curved needle with attached silk thread for transfixing it , if that became necessary ; a silver trachea tube ; a basin for catching vomit . Drew raised the forceps for a final inspection . The carbolic solution dripped from the blades . A professor on the Harvard faculty had once referred to the forceps as the great prime mover of obstetrics . No one knew who had invented the instrument . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Persian physician who had lived in the tenth and eleventh centuries , had been familiar with the forceps . Watching the wet blades shine in the gaslight , Will had a strong sense of the worthy traditions of his profession . In the hall , a woman moaned . " Find the anesthetic ? " Drew asked as he laid the forceps on a square of linen that had come out of the carbolic basin a few minutes earlier . Will nodded , holding up two corked cans of ether . It was Dr. Squibb 's , generally considered the best available . The orderly opened the door . The moaning grew louder . As Clarence tried to maneuver his cart into the stifling room , Drew 's eyes shifted past Will to the mother . Instantly , his anxious look disappeared , replaced by a confident smile . Will understood the abrupt change when he saw the young woman . She was awake , and terrified . The girl was only eighteen or so . She had a pretty , highcheekboned face , bright with sweat . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath a soiled sheet . She tried to respond to Drew 's smile with a shy and  | hopeful one of her own , but the fright in her hazel eyes was unmistakable . How much greater that fear must be because she 2ould n't understand what was said by those around her , Will thought . Her expression had a sudden and unexpected +Ifect on him . It made Vlandingham 's greed seem conemptible . They transferred the girl from the cart to the table . She ; aid something to Drew in a foreign language . Even though her words made no sense to him , he responded with a nod and solicitous sounds . " Do n't worry , " he said , his round head bobbing . He placed his left hand just above the mountainous belly . ' We 'll take care of your baby . He 'll be perfectly fine . We 'll see to it , Doctor Kent and I. " Somehow , she comprehended one word . " Doctor ? Doc-tor ? " " Yes , I 'm Doctor Hastings . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Kent . We 're both doctors . You 're ; ale . " He was stretching the truth by using the term doctor to refer to a couple of students ; but it was what she wanted to hear . She nodded , her eyes fixing on Drew with unquestioning trust . She was in a foreign land , in pain , but the two young men were relievers of pain  --  deliverers of children . That much was clear , and it eased her anxiety . Suddenly she clenched her teeth and her fists . Another contraction wracked her body . Drew 's eyes flicked to Will , a signal . Will opened his pocket watch ; laid it on a stool . His hand shook slightly as he picked up the Allis inhaler , a metal tube more oval than round . After a quick look at the gas flame hissing overhead , he began to sprinkle ether on the long gauze bandage threaded through the maze of wires within the inhaler . He hoped to God he did n't make a mistake . No one spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's mouth . He continued to sprinkle ether into the other end , glancing frequently at his watch . Its tick seemed thunderous . Ten minutes passed . Twelve .  | The girl 's face turned deep red , a sign of the first stage of ether narcosis . Will warned Clarence to be ready for the possible onset of violent struggling . The young woman started to mutter . Soon she was babbling loudly , and tossing in a restive way ; not quite sleeping yet . Her hands spasmed toward her belly ; she still felt the contractions . The pain should be lessening moment by mo-mentThe babbling stopped . The girl passed safely into the deep , completely relaxed second stage of anesthesia . Will said : " You 're free to go ahead . " Drew turned the gas jets up full . Then he lifted the sheet and bared the girl 's lower body . The orderly started to snigger . Drew 's murderous look silenced him . Drew positioned the girl 's feet and told Clarence to tie them . The loutish young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drew complimented him . The orderly lost his sullen look . The gaslight hissed ; the pocket watch ticked . Will 's clothing was soaked with sweat . He stood behind the girl 's head , lightly holding the inhaler in place , his heart slamming fast and hard within his chest . He leaned down to check the girl 's pulse . Drew looked at him . " All right ? " " Yes , fine . " With great care , Drew inserted his hand to examine the fetus trapped in the birth canal . The problem he faced was stark and simple . In the posterior position , the back of the fetus was toward the mother 's back . This put the head in an attitude in which its largest dimension pushed against the walls of a uterine canal made too narrow by a pelvic bone structure Drew had characterized as inadequate . Had the girl been fortunate enough to be born with a normal pelvis  --  the luck of the draw , some doctors termed it  --  the fetus might have passed through the canal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so a rotation was necessary .  | With the fetus in the correct position  --  its back toward the mother 's belly  --  the head would be in a slightly different attitude , presenting a slightly narrower dimension to the canal opening . The difference was only a matter of one or two centimeters , but it was critical if the fetus was to be driven downward and outward to the air , and to life , by the mother 's labor . When Drew was sure the dilation of the os was complete , he took a deep breath . Then he moved his right hand forward again , slipping it up into the uterus , well out of sight . The hand was positioned between the side of the fetus 's head and the uterine wall on the mother 's left side . It would stay there as a guide and buffer for the potentially damaging blade of the forceps . Drew 's face shone under the gaslight . Will whispered an order . Clarence took a rag and mopped Drew 's forehead and cheeks . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lower lip , Drew took the left forceps blade in his left hand . He slowly inserted the blade next to his right hand . The procedure seemed to take hours . He pulled his right hand out . Jammed his sleeve against his forehead to swab sweat away . He glanced at Will again , his tension unmistakable . Once more Will checked the girl 's pulse . " Everything satisfactory . " Drew reached for the right forceps blade . His palm must have been excessively slick . The metal handle slipped away from him . Clarence caught the handle just before it hit the floor . He did n't touch the blade . Drew nodded his appreciation . Slowly and carefully , he inserted the blade into the opposite side of the uterus . Deeper Deeper Drew swallowed hard ; took another long breath . Then Will heard the faint click as the crossed blades locked . With barely a pause , Drew began to rotate the forceps clockwise , like a man turning a key in a lock . Suddenly his face wrenched . " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wo n't budge . " With the fetus in a perfect posterior position , the practitioner had a choice of rotations  --  to the right or to the left . Either way , a turn of a hundred eighty degrees was required . Sometimes a fetus was canted slightly in one direction or another , requiring a turn of only a hundred thirty-five degrees or even less . Drew had n't been that fortunate . And the direction he 'd picked had been the wrong one . Face twisted into a mask of concentration , he applied pressure in the other direction . It seemed to Will that his friend was barely breathing . He was undoubtedly conscious of the blades clasping the fetus 's head , and of the potential for damage . One mistake and an entire lifetime could be blighted , even before the fetus was transformed into an infant by its first struggling intake of outside air . " Turning , " Drew said abruptly . Under the flaring gas , he looked like a hunched cherub there at the end of the table . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on  --  a little more . Come on ? " Will 's spine prickled . There was hope on Drew 's face now ; the fetus was rotating properly . Drew maintained the gentle but firm pressure . And as Will continued to monitor the young woman 's pulse and respiration , he knew he was witnessing a miracle . The kind of miracle of love and concern that made one human being minister to another not because there was money to be made , but because there was pain , and danger , and desperate need . " Done ! " Drew exclaimed , looking ready to faint . " Done , by God ! " " And no advice needed from Dr. Leishman , " Will said by way of a compliment . " Not so far , anyway . I swear , Will this one 's big as a lumberjack . " Will grinned . " Let 's see . " " Any minute now . " With the fetus reversed in the birth canal , Drew removed the forceps and turned them over in preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again inserted , he formed a tight ring around the crossed shanks with his left thumb and index finger . Clarence reached over Drew 's arm to place a sponge between the handles , both of which Drew held in his right hand . The sponge protected p 391 against accidental pressure on the head of the fetus as Drew grasped it with the blades and began the extraction . He did it perfectly , simulating the contractions of the uterus in labor . He 'd give a little tug , then let up . Another tug ; another pause . Downward and then upward in the classic arc , he brought a small head through the canal and into the open . Amid the fuzz of black hair Will could clearly see the soft indentation of the posterior fontanel . He watched tiny red ears and the back of a neck come into sight above the mother 's pubis . Then small shoulders , a backbone , and buttocks appeared . Drew brought the newborn the rest of the way into the world , as proud and delighted as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a lumberjack . Look at him ! Ten pounds if he 's an ounce . " After one whack of his wrinkled red bottom , the baby howled . Will felt tears of joy in his eyes . Drew 's hands moved confidently as he cut and tied the cord . The newborn kicked and screamed while Drew lowered him to clean towels Clarence was holding . The orderly , too , had a soft , wondering look on his coarse face . Drew smiled in a weary but satisfied way . The baby boy was strong of lung , and apparently perfect . Within a couple of hours , the mother had her first bleary look at her child . She was resting on a cot Drew had set up in his own office . While Will handed the young woman the warm , squirming bundle , Drew cooled her forehead with a cloth dipped in alcohol . Although the mother understood none of what Drew and Will said as they murmured appreciations of her fine son , something in Drew 's expression continued to communicate calmness , reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal in steerage , and her more recent one at Castle Gardens to a good purpose . The purpose was wiggling and squalling in her arms . " Very fine , " Drew said , lifting the blanket so the mother could clearly see the infant 's sex . " A very fine , strong boy . " He kept smiling and nodding as he said it . The exhausted  | girl understood . She burst into tears . The sight sent another shiver up Will 's spine . Then the young woman uttered a short sentence Will did n't understand . Her tone of pride was unmistakable , though . Drew seemed to grasp what she meant . As he tucked the starched sheet beneath her chin , he bobbed his head again : " Yes , that 's a very good thing . A good omen for his life . " Softly , Will asked , " What did she say ? " " She said born in America . She 's glad her son came into the world on this side of the Atlantic . " He unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ones . As he began to wrap the baby , he added , " I 'm glad I was here to help her . " Will gazed down at the tired , pretty face of the young woman , so peaceful and happy now that her ordeal was over . He was deeply moved ; as moved as he 'd been that first night he watched Lon Adam work . " So am I , " he said . Medicine was n't a chateau on Fifth Avenue , an investment portfolio , an invitation to the Astor ball . This was what medicine was all about . This . THE REST OF WILL 's week in New York passed swiftly . He moved in with Drew at a run-down rooming house near Battery Park . Cost of an extra bed ? thirty cents a night . He did n't mind staying in such a sleazy place ; he and Drew were seldom there . They spent most of their time at Castle Garden . Large as Castle Garden was , the facility was still taxed  | to capacity . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An atmosphere of confusion prevailed . Nor was Castle Garden free of official corruption , Will discovered . Drew said he 'd seen cheating and pricegouging at the currency exchange and general store inside the gates . One official who was supposed to give newcomers advice about honest boarding houses had recently been discharged for sending people to a filthy tenement owned by his wife . Two middle-aged doctors supervised the Castle Garden inspection station . A few minor cases were treated on the premises , rather than at Ward 's Island . Drew got most of these  --  not an easy assignment , because many of the patients were hard to handle . They feared the American doctors and were suspicious , even hostile because they did n't know the language and customs of their new country . Drew worked twelve to fourteen hours a day . Will accompanied him everywhere , and quickly discovered that his friend had a remarkable knack for putting the immigrants at ease and winning their trust . His air of competence and his innate kindness were instantly communicated to patients , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed the feverish forehead of a young Bohemian boy , or palpated the flux-bloated belly of an old , surly Russian , he soon calmed them , won them , had them smiling and swallowing Whatever medicine he wanted them to take . He talked blithely about the medicine in English , as if he was confident they 'd understand . Somehow , Will almost believed they did . It struck him that in at least one respect , Drew was very much like Lon Adam . He did more than merely treat symptoms . He was a healer of the spirit . Will decided that the man whose style he wanted to emulate in his own practice was not Vlandingham , but Drew . It was a tall order . Although Drew would n't get his diploma for another year , he was already a skilled practitioner : Perhaps a better one 1 , than Will could ever hope to be . The week soon came to an end . Castle Garden received no immigrants on Sunday , so the two friends decided to treat themselves to a good meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first they 'd visit the city 's newest tourist attraction . They took a steam launch  | out to Bedloe 's Island for a close look at the Bartholdi statue . A midweek thunderstorm had cleared the air and brought a spell of cool , almost autumnal weather . Sunlight sparkled on the harbor and the rooftops of lower Manhattan . From Bedloe 's Island the view of the city was impressive . And from the base of the granite and concrete pedestal designed by Richard Morris Hunt , the view straight up was breathtaking . The colossal statue with its covering of more than three hundred copper sheets towered into the cloudless sky . The great torch upraised in Liberty 's right hand was so far above them , Will could almost imagine that it was visible on the other side of the ocean . They walked all the way around the pedestal , then entered a hallway which led to the stairs . On a plaque in the hall they found " The New Colossus , " the sonnet by Emma Lazarus which the statue had , inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had a special , personal significance for Will ; his family had been founded by a young European boy yearning to breathe free , as the poetess had put it . Still saying nothing , the friends walked outside again . The sea wind was raising white water on the Atlantic . Will took off his straw hat and let the wind cool his forehead . He squinted against the sun 's glare and softly repeated the line he 'd found most memorable : " The wretched refuse of your teeming shore ? ' I understand that now that I 've seen Castle Garden . America takes them all . " " We do , and we should be proud of it , " Drew said . " It 's hardly a pleasure to examine some of them after they 've been cooped up between decks a week or so . But once you look into their faces , you forget the shabbiness and the stench . You understand what this country means to them . We take it for granted , but to them it 's a haven like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jetty where the excursion launches docked . " I 'm glad I got a summer job here , " Drew went on , hands in his pockets and his eyes fixed on the ocean . " It 's clarified my thinking about what I want to do after I get my diploma . " He pointed a plump finger at Castle Garden and the  | panorama of buildings beyond the Battery . " That makes Harvard seem like the proverbial ivory tower . That 's the real world , Will . There 's so much squalor and pain in that one city , no single life 's long enough to do all that needs to be done to relieve it . " Will thought he knew the direction Drew wanted the , conversation to take . The realization made him defensive , even a bit testy : " If you 're trying to say that only greenhorns and the II ; poor get sick , you know you 're distorting the truth . And I still believe every doctor ought to practice where he wants to practice . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Meaning ? ? " " Meaning that a doctor is seldom needed very urgently in the parlors along Fifth Avenue . There , the typical illness II is some society girl 's headache , which is usually imagi- nary . " Will stepped in front of his friend , his dark eyes fierce and bright in the sunlight : " Drew , why the hell are you constantly sitting in judgment of me ? " " Because we 're friends . " " Does that confer some special right to criticize ? " " I think so . " " Well , whether it does or not , we wo n't be friends for long if you keep it up . " Drew 's cocksure smile turned a bit uneasy then . " I 've got to , Will . You have the makings of a fine doctor . But someone 's got to set you straight before you waste your talent . " Will could n't help laughing . " My God , I 've never heard i such gall . Is it a Yankee characteristic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hastings characteristic . " Will 's smile faded . " Whatever it is , I damned well resent your constant hints that I 'll turn out to be nothing but a medical hack . " " Hints ? " Drew 's round head bobbed from side to side . " No hints . I 'm saying it straight out . Except for rare mo-ments  --  helping me deliver that baby was one  --  you do n't seem to care about anything but the financial and social rewards of being a doctor . I admit you can probably set up  | a very lucrative practice thanks to your liaison with Laura Pen ? " " Leave my personal life out of this ! " Drew sighed . " Wish I could , but I ca n't . " " Who the hell appointed you as my conscience ? " He did n't take offense : " I 'm self-appointed . You have ' talent , and I refuse to let you squander it . You 're trying hard to do so . " " Goddamn it , you 're wrong ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud voice attracted the attention of several sightseers just getting off a launch . Glaring at Will , a mother hurried two small girls out of the range of further profanity . A part of Will 's anger sprang from guilt . He could n't deny that he 'd been preoccupied with money and social position for the last year or so . But Castle Garden  --  and Drew  --  had done a great deal to remind him of medicine 's true purpose . " Wrong , am I ? " Drew had a strange , almost sly smile on his round face . " All right , prove it . " " What 's that ? " " I think I spoke clearly . I said prove that I 'm wrong . If you 're hell-bent on practicing uptown , instead of taking your skills to people genuinely desperate for them ? " " And who might those people be ? " Drew turned and pointed to the doorway in the pedestal . He referred to the Lazarus sonnet , and those it described . The human garbage of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failed farms and stagnating villages of a dozen ancient countries . The seekers of the second chance . The travelers who had risked all they had ? savings , security , sometimes even sanity or life itself  --  to reach the American shore . " Weekends , I 've been poking around up in the Sixth Ward , " Drew continued , his tone more temperate all at once . " The Sixth contains the worst slum in the city . The Mulberry Street Bend . I 've decided to practice there . And to open a free clinic . " " Well , " said Will softly . " That 's a major decision . " " The doctors at Castle Garden are already teasing me about it . They say I must have come of missionary parents since I plan to practice in Hell . " " Sounds like you do . Why not go into the Roman priest-  | hood and take the vows of poverty and chastity while you 're at it ? " He was instantly ashamed of the sarcasm . A resigned , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision takes care of the poverty part . Ensures it , I guess you could say . As for the chastity , I reckon I 'll always have to pay for whatever feminine companionship I get . I see girls I like , but when I say hello , they wo n't even answer because I 'm so fat . " He shrugged . " By now I 'm re-signed to that . But look  --  here 's what I was getting at when I said you could prove you really care about helping people : I want you to go into that free clinic with me . " Will thought of what was symbolized by the words free clinic . Failure . An admission to the world that a man 11 could n't practice medicine profitably . Incredibly , Drew was n't being forced into such a position . He was making his choice voluntarily ! " Out of the question , " Will said . " Do n't turn me down so fast . You 've already said you ! y plan to set up shop in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then give me a chance to show you what needs to be done in the Mulberry Bend . Stay over a few more days . We 'll take a tour of ? " " No , I ca n't . You know I 'm due back in Boston to study with Dr. Green . " " Next summer , then . Your social calendar is n't booked that far ahead , is it ? " " Do n't be snide . " " Well , is it ? " " Of course not . " " Then come with me to the Bend next summer . I 've met another doctor down there . An old fellow , ready to retire soon . It 's his practice that I plan to buy  --  provided I can arrange a loan . " A loan of ten dollars is probably all you 'll need for a practice like that , Will thought , but he did n't say it . Growing more enthusiastic , Drew went on : " Give me as much time as you can next year , but promise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man a few hours every day , and you 'll soon see there 's plenty of work for two men . " " How long have you been hatching this insane ? ? "  | " Next summer . I want your word on it . " He took hold of Will 's arm . His deceptively soft hands constricted like bands of metal . " Your word . " Angered , Will shot back , " All right ! On one condition . " " What is it ? " " I do n't want to hear another syllable about my personal life . " " Done , " Drew exclaimed . His pale gray eyes shone in the sunshine . " Let 's catch the launch and go to Luchow 's to celebrate . " " Celebrate ? " Will snorted . " Celebrate volunteering to spend a week in the midst of drunks and thieves and pushcart peddlers ? " " Americans , " Drew said , pointing back at the pedestal again . " With just as much right to the name as the nabobs on Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will shook his head . " What the hell have I gotten myself into ? " Drew laughed . " The most important part of your life . Excepting your marriage , of course , " he added , but with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm or conviction . The following night , an express on the New York &; New Haven line rattled through a heavy rainstorm , carrying a thoroughly sick Will Kent toward home . After dining at Luchow 's  --  no , gorging was a better word  --  he and Drew had gone back to the rooming house and consumed a huge quantity of cheap bourbon . Now Will had almost every known symptom of subacute gastritis . Overpowering thirst and a coated tongue . Extreme tenderness over the epigastrium . Flatulence and eructation . Diarrhea , slight pyrexia , and highly colored urine . A hammering head , a weak pulse , and cold feet . Plus a general feeling of debility and depression . Dr. Austin Flint 's textbook commentary on the condition carried a faintly moralistic tone which made him feel no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debauch . Patients who are spirit-drinkers should be told of the connection of the disease with their habits . "  | A little late for that now ! He could n't eat , or even think about food , without coming close to throwing up . He 'd tried a little of everything recommended as a treatment . Small pieces of ice . Carbonated water . Salts of morphia . Milk mixed with lime water and a bowl of farina , both of which had refused to remain at their intended destination . Nothing helped ; he was a digestive wreck . He 'd just have to wait until his system decided he 'd been sufficiently punished for his foolishness . But it was n't even the sickness causing his sharpest concern  --  and confusion  --  tonight . It was what he 'd promised his friend , and what the consequences of that promise might be . In a way , Drew had tricked him . He 'd provoked an ar-gument in which Will 's pledge had been drawn from him in a burst of anger . Drew understood very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how hard to press Will in order to elicit the response he 'd gotten . Queasy , Will rested his forehead against the grimy window , his gaze lost in the dark of the Connecticut woodlands through which the train was speeding . He was in a trap . Squarely in a trap . Yesterday he 'd made a promise which was in direct conflict with the one he 'd given Laura ? and with the monumentally important one to Carter . He thought about his dilemma with as much clarity as possible , given his miserable condition . Certain facts , seemingly irreconcilable , had to be taken into account in any solution of the problem Drew had precipitated : First , Will was in love with Laura Pennel . He worshiped her . But he also knew that Drew was right about the triviality of a society practice . What he 'd seen in the eyes of the young Polish girl after he and Drew had delivered her child had all but canceled the impression left by Dr. Vlandingham . Will wanted to be not merely a competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant taking care of people who genuinely needed help . And as Vlandingham had suggested during their conversation at Sherry 's , there was no shortage of doctors on Fifth Avenue . Just the opposite . So perhaps , in order to reconcile that which seemed irreconcilable , something had to give way . The promise to Laura ? The short term of service with Drew next summer hardly  | classified as horse doctoring in Will 's mind . But it would be classified that way by Thurman Pennel 's daughter . Every human being had failings , and one of hers was arrogance . Perhaps he could do something about that after they were married . He 'd certainly try . But at present , it was an undeniable part of Laura 's character . To her , the patients Drew examined at Castle Garden , and those he intended to treat in the city 's slums would be  --  in Emma Lazarus ' word  --  refuse . If he helped Drew treat such people next summer , Laura would object If she knew about it . All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out , ever . To ensure that she did n't , he 'd have to keep his promise to Drew  --  and his fulfillment of it  --  a secret known only to the two of them . He 'd have to keep it from Laura , from Marcus , from the Harvard faculty and fellow medical students  --  from everyone . It was unpleasant to think of deceiving the girl he meant to marry . He knew of no other way out . He was torn , wanting the best of two worlds . He 'd try like hell to have both , without ever being forced to choose between them . He thought it would work but he could n't be sure . There were many potential pitfalls . Many , he repeated to himself as he stared into the rainy night , the swaying lamps of the car reflecting his bleak face on the dark , wet glass . GIDEON 'S LE1 ' 1'ER TO MOULTRIE Calhoun of the World brought about a cordial dinner between the two men , thus provoking a stormy outburst from Joseph Pulitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wold , his mansion in Bar Harbor , Maine , where he was summering . He demanded a meeting with Gideon . Gideon pondered strategy , then decided he could best blunt Pulitzer 's attack by a show of politeness . He wrote a note inviting his rival to an overnight cruise aboard Auvergne . Julia told Gideon he was asking for trouble , but he insisted on sending the note : " Dealing with Joe should n't be any worse than putting your head up next to the muzzle of a Yankee cannon . Besides , I doubt he 'll take me up on it . " To their surprise , they received an acceptance . So the yacht steamed up the coast , and the Kents welcomed their competitor and his entourage on board with appropriate ceremony . Politeness forbade any immediate discussion of the successful outcome of Gideon 's dinner meeting with Calhoun . But the dinner had taken place three weeks earlier . Now Gideon was worrying that perhaps Pulitzer had presented a counter offer ; one which was too attractive for Calhoun to resist . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation ? Merely to gloat ? That was n't like him . Answers would have to wait until evening . Soon the yacht was headed south again , toward Mount Desert Rock . As dinner began , the Hungarian-born newspaperman was polite , but no more than that . His occasional smile was closer to a wince . Heavily bearded and wearing prim-looking eyeglasses , he resembled a professor of the classics more than he did a publisher with a taste for the sensational . " I 'm delighted we could meet here rather than in New York , " Gideon said after twenty minutes of trivial talk about Washington , world affairs , and various aspects of the newspaper business  --  not including the thorny one which had brought them together . " I 've never seen your yacht , " Pulitzer said . " Very handsome . " Gideon murmured thanks . " Besides , even in the summer Chatwold 's a mausoleum . You know I like company . " That was evident from the two male secretaries Pulitzer had brought along for the overnight trip . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's been some time since we 've seen each other , Gideon. "  | His host nodded . " Eight or nine months . " And in that interval , Pulitzer 's health had obviously taken a bad turn . Coming into the dining saloon , he had moved slowly , and squinted as if his eyesight were failing . Pulitzer was actually four years younger than Gideon , but a lung condition had forced him to relinquish day-to-day management of the World two years earlier , though he still exercised rigid control of the paper 's policies . Lightning glared on the glass of the portholes . A rain squall was moving across Auvergne 's bow . The subsequent drum of thunder made Pulitzer squirm and dab his eyes with a handkerchief . A few seconds later , Julia accidentally dropped a teaspoon . It struck the silver sugar bowl ; not a loud noise , but a sudden one . Within seconds , perspiration was pouring down Pulitzer 's cheeks and gleaming in his beard . He managed to say , " I had another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on board your yacht when we discuss the subject of piracy . " Gideon sat motionless . So did Julia . Both felt the emotional temperature drop . " I made a bona fide offer , Joe . And I did n't ask Mr. Calhoun to keep it secret . " " Oh , believe me , he did n't . But I very much resent your maneuvering behind my back . " " Joe , come off it . With your circulation , you 've been licking the Union and every other daily in New York . My editorial department 's been in disarray ever since Theo Payne died . I have to do something about that . To continue your nautical metaphor  --  suppose I were the captain of a sinking vessel , and your ship were the only one in the area with a lifeboat large enough to hold my crew . Would you deny me the right to reach out and save their lives , and mine ? " Rain began to spatter the deck above the saloon . Pulitzer reacted as if rifles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect himself . He looked hard at Gideon : " Sophistry ! Slick words that have nothing to do with the issue . You stole Moultrie Calhoun from my staff . " " Stole ? ? Past tense ? " Gideon could n't conceal his surprise . " Yes . He submitted his resignation . I offered him half  | again what he was making at the World , and he still refused to stay . " Because he 's unhappy with the working conditions and with your temperamental behavior . But Gideon would n't have said that under any circumstances . " He has n't officially informed me ? " Gideon began . " I 'm informing you ! Calhoun 's an able journalist . A valuable man . I want to keep him . " It had the sound of an edict . Growing annoyed in spite of himself , Gideon shrugged : " It appears you ca n't . I 'd say our discussion of the issue is closed . " " No it is n't . Withdraw the offer . " " In my place , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you withdraw it . " Slowly , Gideon shook his head . " Joe , I refuse . " Pulitzer leaned forward , red-faced and wrathful . Before he could speak , another peal of thunder jolted him back against his chair . His eyes watered behind his schoolmas-ter 's glasses . He thumped the table : " All right ! If the son of a bitch does n't like the World any longer , you take him  --  I wo n't have him ! But let me Li tell you one more thing ? " Again that wrenching grimace , intended as a smirk . " I do n't forget things like this . One day I 'll drive you to the wall . " Gideon puffed his cigar and managed to smile . " That comes as no surprise . You 're already hard at it . " The drumming of the rain intensified suddenly , forestalling another retort . Pulitzer pressed his palms to his ears , as if in extreme pain . He stumbled to his feet and accidentally lurched into Julia 's chair . Before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep your seat , Mrs. Kent . You 'll have to excuse me . " When Pulitzer was gone , Gideon called Anderson to refill his brandy snifter . " Calhoun was right . Joe 's getting more and more peculiar . He ca n't tolerate noise , but he has those flunkeys who talk or read to him all night long because he ca n't sleep . I 'm thankful the Almighty never made me a genius . You pay a high price for it . " gg " Are you sorry you invited him ? " Gideon shook his head . " At least everything 's out in the open now . I can put Moultrie Calhoun to work with no  | qualms . If I can get the paper back on a sound footing , maybe I can concentrate on Kent and Son for a while . " But it was neither the paper nor the publishing house that worried him most . Even the chest pains that still plagued him were inconsequential when compared to the mistake he 'd made in judging his son . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right track . He had been wrong ; blindly , devastatingly wrong . He tossed down the remaining brandy as if it were water . " My , you drank that rather fast . " " I 'd say that was my affair , would n't you ? " A moment later he jumped up , circled the table and squeezed her shoulders by way of apology : " I 'm sorry . That was a churlish thing to say . " " What 's troubling you , dear ? " " The usual . Business problems . " He leaned down to touch his lips to her forehead . She turned in her chair , reaching up to clasp his arm . He kissed her mouth . It was an awkward embrace , but for Gideon a comforting one . As they were proceeding to their cabin , Nyquist , the deck hand , pointed out that the squall had already passed astern . Gideon thanked him and said goodnight . Alone in their quarters , he and Julia came into each other 's arms ? he needing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made love during the yacht 's last violent rollings . Afterward he felt better , and again apologized for his rudeness . But he still could n't tell her the cause of his deep-seated worry . He still could n't repeat the things he 'd been hearing from one of the Union 's most reliable reporters . Mr. Moultrie Calhoun was a portly widower of fifty-two . I He disliked his former employer , but he favored Pulitzer 's brand of journalism . When he and Gideon concluded their negotiations and shook hands , Gideon told the Charlestonborn editor that he could and should begin spicing the Union 's front pages with some crime and society news . From his very first day at the paper , Calhoun took  | charge . In contrast to the vituperative Theo Payne , he was a quiet man who seldom raised his voice . But he had eyes of an arresting blue-gray . The color of a pistol barrel , someone remarked to Gideon . Calhoun had been at his desk only two hours when he turned that gunmetal gaze on a reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factual errors and sloppy writing in a piece of copy . The reporter took one look at those eyes and jumped to it . As soon as all the copy for the next day 's paper was in the composing room , Calhoun convened a meeting of the staff . Gideon gave the new editor a short introduction , then sat down . It took Calhoun less than two minutes to state his expectations . He would dispense with the services of anyone who did n't obey orders promptly , or behave in a seemly way : " You may drink yourselves to perdition , ladies and gentlemen . You may  --  I shall use frank language despite the presence of the gentler sex  --  debauch until you have guaranteed yourselves berths in the nether region . You may lie and cheat until the Devil himself distrusts you . But you will keep all such activity separate from these premises , and never let it interfere with the performance of your duties . If my requirements are not to your liking , or your character is such that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I urge you to seek employment elsewhere . You will not last long working for me . We are responsible journalists upon whom the public depends for the truth . We shall behave accordingly  --  at least during working hours . Which , I must warn you , will not be short . Thank you for your attention . That is all . " That night Calhoun kept the staff at their desks long past the normal quitting time . One by one he called the reporters and illustrators into his office , closed the door and interviewed them . By four the next morning , he had issued dismissal notices to three writers and one staff artist . Clutching their severance pay , they staggered into the dawn shaking their heads . Gideon woke on the cot where he 'd been catching a nap . Calhoun looked fresh and full of energy : " All personnel problems have been taken care of , Mr. Kent . Shall we go out for breakfast ? " " Are n't you going to sleep ? "  | " I had n't planned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start working on the next edition . " Yawning , Gideon sat up , folded the blanket and laid it on the end of the cot . " Did you serve in the war , Mr. Cal-houn ? " " Please call me Moultrie , sir . " " Very well , Moultrie . Did you serve ? " " I did . " " Which side ? " " The same side as yours , sir . " He seemed anxious not to say that too loudly in a Northern newspaper office . " I was a telegraph clerk . " " Well , if we 'd had a few more like you running things in Richmond , maybe we would n't have fared so badly . I 'll join you for an omelette and some black coffee . But you 'll have to nudge me if I doze off . I 'm only forty-five , but you put me to shame . " From that first day , Gideon was completely satisfied with the work of his new editor . Calhoun 's childless wife had been dead five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall election campaign intensified  --  the Union endorsed Cleveland  --  Calhoun used the weekends to come to Boston to report on progress at the paper , and to listen to his employer 's reaction . One of the meetings was held at Kent and Son . There , Calhoun. met Helene Vail for the first time . He kissed her hand , murmured some pleasantries , and managed to bring a pink glow to her cheeks . On Calhoun 's next visit , Gideon asked his typewriter to be present to make notes on a number of important financial decisions . He was astonished when Miss Vail appeared with a new hairdo and a new dress . That night he said to Julia : " I do believe our thorny rose may blossom . She was giddy as a young girl around Calhoun . Maybe she wo n't be listing herself as disappointed in love ' much longer . " He was trying to act lighthearted , but strain was clearly written on his face . What secret anxiety was tormenting him ? Julia wondered .  | Grover Cleveland amassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Republican candidate had a larger total of electoral votes , and hence won the presidency . His party took control of both houses of Congress . The best that a disgruntled Gideon could say about the election was that his friend Roosevelt , who had remained loyal to the Republicans , might now find an outlet for his talent in Washington . He hoped so ; the country would gain by it . As winter approached , Gideon and Julia continued to entertain friends and well-known people at their dinner table . Samuel Clemens , the writer who called himself Mark Twain , paid them a return visit . On another evening , Professor William James , the anatomist , drove over from Cambridge . He said little about his developing interest in psychology , but he could n't say enough about his expatriate brother Henry , whose fiction was being hailed as the work of a genius . Regrettably , Gideon found that same work unbearably boring . One week they entertained the evangelist Dwight Moody , who was saving souls up and down New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue those same souls from folly  --  Bob Ingersoll , the successful Washington lawyer whom the press called The Great Agnostic . He was in town to deliver his famous lecture , " Some Mistakes of Moses . " An aging Edwin Booth spent an evening at the Kent house and spoke of the fine reputation Eleanor was building in the theater ; she and Leo were currently on tour with one of the troupes sent out by the famous producer-manager Augustin Daly . Booth seemed a hollow man , somehow ; he was somber and melancholy despite his international fame . Twice he made reference to " poor Johnny . " He was obviously still haunted by what his actor brother had done that calamitous night at Ford 's Theatre . Two pillars of the women 's movement  --  leaders of opposing factions within it  --  came to dinner on the same evening . Julia had gone to great lengths to arrange the reunion between the two , who had parted over a policy dispute years before .  | One guest had often been at the house  --  Julia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association which had its headquarters in Boston . She was small , seventy years old , and remarkably energetic . The other was a newcomer to the Kent house . She was Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton , reputedly the first woman to refuse to include the word obey in her marriage ceremony . She and Susan B. Anthony directed the National Woman Suffrage Association in New York . The National was generally considered the more radical of the two wings . Mrs. Stanton had come to Boston for one of the lyceum lectures which kept her traveling a good part of each year . Like Lucy Stone , she was just a little over five feet tall . She had merry eyes and a tart manner . At seventy-three , she was as animated and good-humored as her counterpart Mrs. Stone . There was tension when the two suffragists first greeted one another in the parlor , but soon the atmosphere was cordial and comfortable . Julia was clearly elated ; a reconciliation between the two organizations was one of her highest hopes . She argued that the movement already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly damned it and its leaders from every available platform . Why , then , should women further impair their own cause by quarreling among themselves ? They needed a united front , not a divided one . To prepare the ground for this dinner party , she 'd gone to Washington several months earlier , to the first International Council of Women , sponsored by the National Association . There she had stated her case to Mrs. Stanton and Susan Anthony . Now there were signs that a resolution of differences , and a reunion of the two groups , might be forthcoming . At least Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Stone were dining at the same table , and appearing to enjoy it . Differences remained , of course ; important ones . Lucy Stone still believed women should only work to gain the vote , and not damage that effort by involving themselves with issues such as divorce and child bearing , and debates about virginity and marital fidelity . Although a model of moral behavior herself , Elizabeth Stanton had quite different views  --  especially on free love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters who march under our banner are spotless white or screaming scarlet . What  | counts is their conviction . We 've had enough women sacrificed to this sentimental , hypocritical prattling about purity . It 's one of man 's most effective engines for dividing and subjugating us  --  nothing personal , Mr. Kent , " she added with a crisp nod in his direction . " I say we must put an end to . that ignoble record and stand for one thing only  --  with no qualifications . Womanhood . " A prolonged silence then . Julia looked crestfallen ; surely the prospect for reconciliation was ruined . But Lucy Stone spoke up with just the right blend of ! I firmness and restraint : " Friendship has many rare qualities , Elizabeth . One of the most precious is this . True friends can disagree about a few things and still work together . Whatever our differences on lesser questions , we have none on the greatest question of all . Freedom for women . I fear we may have forgotten that fact  --  and our friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face softened . " I fear we have . Perhaps 1 it 's time we remembered . " She held out her hand . So did Lucy . They clasped hands for a moment , both of them smiling . There were no more ' ' disagreements that evening , and a spirit of good feeling prevailed . Julia was overjoyed . But she noticed that Gideon had a preoccupied air , and a drawn look . Why ? In the days that followed , he began to grow snappish with her  --  behavior not typical of him . For hours and even days at a time , he 'd say little more than what was necessary . He seemed not only depressed but perpetually tired . Julia urged him to see a doctor . He denied there was anything wrong with him physically . She felt he was n't tell-ing her the truth . Finally , on Christmas Eve , matters came to a head . It promised to be a lonely Christmas . Perhaps the loneliest they 'd spent together . None of the children was home . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning . At noon , the servants had been given their gifts and the rest of the day off . The house was still ; heavy with shadows . Why turn on lights when no one was there ? j'z ..  | Julia and Gideon had gone to the parlor after eating a simple supper she 'd fixed . There was no illumination in the parlor except that from the candles on the small , fragrant fir tree . Hands locked behind his back , Gideon paced in front of the window overlooking the Common . Occasionally he stopped and peered out . He looked dejected ; miserable . Finally Julia could stand it no longer : " Gideon , come here and tell me what 's wrong . " Without looking at her , he said , " What do you mean ? " " You know very well . You have n't been yourself for months . You really must tell me what 's troubling you . I ca n't help if I do n't know . " He turned from the window . It was a bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dark . There 'd be no snow to soften the iron cold , everyone said . His blue eye momentarily reflected candlelight . " Has it showed that much ? " " I 'm afraid so . " She moved to his side , her skirts rustling . " Are you thinking about the children ? " He was silent a moment . Then he nodded . " I miss them . They should be home on Christmas ! " " They 're grown , darling . They have their own lives . " " But what are they doing with their lives ? Nothing worthwhile that I can see . Poor Eleanor 's performing in some ten-cent town , spending Christmas in a hotel . " " But she 's with Leo , and she 's happy . " " God , I hope so . And what about Carter ? He 's idling his life away in Colorado ? " " You must n't take all the burdens of the family on yourself , dear . That 's a Kent family failing , and frustrated idealism can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waywardness . I 'm more responsible than anyone else . Besides , he is n't in Colorado any longer . " " How do you know ? " " A letter came in the morning mail . We were so busy getting Will packed off to New York City , I did n't have a chance to show it to you . Carter posted the letter in Denver but it says he 's moving on . " " Where ? " A sad laugh . " That , he did n't say . I do n't suppose he knew . Believe me , I fret over him as much as you do ? " She touched his shoulder . " I suspect I know the real reason  | you 're feeling so bad . You 're angry because Will left to spend Christmas with the Pennels . That 's it , is n't it ? " He did n't answer the question directly : " Did you notice the way he kept talking about them all morning ? As if he damn near worships ' em ! " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect he hopes to marry her . It 's perfectly natural for him to praise her parents . " Gideon did n't seem to hear : " All he wants to be is a Fifth Avenue doctor who dispenses headache remedies to anemic girls . And now he 's taken up with a pack of robbers . " " He 's almost an adult . Even if you feel that way , you must n't say it . " " Why not ? " Gideon shot back . " Must I leave his education  --  or should I say his seduction  --  to bandits like Thurman Pennel ? Godamighty , Julia , the man makes millions from the misery of others ! Factory owners fall all over themselves to buy the wretched buildings his architects slap together . And for years it 's been rumored that he owns whole square blocks of the worst tenements in New York City . " " Rumored , or proven ? " " What difference does it make ? " " A great deal . I want you to make objective judgments about Will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then objectively speaking  --  he 's gone the wrong way . I 've allowed it to happen . " Julia was equally firm . " Regardless of your opinions , you ca n't choose the girl with whom he falls in love . " " Even if she 's the kind who 'll ruin his life ? " " Oh , Gideon  --  that 's terribly exaggerated . What you mean is that Miss Pennel may ruin his life according to your standards . " " My God , whose side are you taking ? " " Please do n't yell . You can not dictate Will 's choice of a wife . " There was a lengthy silence . Finally Gideon let out his breath : " I know . I suppose that 's why I 'm worried . Months ago , I  --  I began to hear some disturbing things about Miss Pennel. "  | Instantly Julia 's anger was gone . " From whom ? " " One of the reporters on the Union . Her name 's Hester Davis . She covers Mrs. Astor 's parties  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very familiar with New York Society families . When she heard Will was seeing Miss Pennel , she came to me and passed along certain facts . Out of consideration for us , she said . " " Facts , Gideon ? Or more rumors ? " " Well  --  rumors , " he admitted . " But there must be something to them . " " What 's the nature of the rumors ? " " That the young lady Will is seeing is n't as pure as her doting mother likes to pretend . Far from it . I do n't understand the why 's and wherefore 's , but Hester claimed that in the Pennel 's circle , the girl 's reputation is so suspect , she ca n't attract a single suitor who would think seriously of marrying her . " " Oh , Gideon  --  those are vicious accusations . Probably completely unfounded . Spread by some spiteful person who has a grudge against the girl . " His shrug admitted the possibility  --  but just barely . " In any case , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have irrefutable proof , you ca n't tell him that the girl he 's fond of is ? " She gestured helplessly . " Immoral . " " But in many ways Will 's an innocent . What if it 's true ? " " What if it is ? - He 's grown up . You have to let him learn the truth for himself . " " Suppose he does n't ? " " That 's a risk you 'll have to take . Unless you intend to destroy him by making all his decisions for the rest of his life . " Gideon fumed . She patted his hand gently . " The Kent spirit 's a worthy and admirable one . But you ca n't play the role of patriarch forever , controlling the lives of grown men and women ? " " And why not ? " " Because it 's out of style ! Times are changing , Gideon ? " " For the worse ! Why should n't I step in if I think Will 's headed for disaster ? Someone has to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A candle on the Christmas tree hissed and dripped wax down its side . " ? or what 's left of it after I 'm gone . I 'll be forty-six  | years old next year . I must get things in order ! I thought Will was the most likely candidate to take charge . That was a terrible mistake . " He sounded hurt and angry . Julia 's eyes softened as she saw his pain . He lit a match and touched it to a cigar . The flame put bright highlights and deep , contrasting shadows on a face no longer young . He flipped the blown-out match into the sand bucket kept handy in case of fire . Then he slipped his arm around his wife : " It has to be Eleanor . Now that Carter 's wandering all over hell and Will 's fallen in with a crowd of whited sepulchers , Eleanor 's the only one left to lead this family when we 're gone . " He pulled Julia close to him . His face was stern in the candlelight  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternness concealed a deep anxiety . She was thankful he 'd finally admitted the cause of his brusque behavior of late . But she firmly believed in the rightness of every word she 'd said to him . Even granting that the accusations about Laura Pennel might contain some truth , Gideon simply could n't go to his son and repeat them . It was an unacceptable alternative . Something else he had just said bothered her : " You must n't count too heavily on Eleanor . She 's immersed in her profession , and in Leo . " " Maybe something will change that . " " What could possibly change it ? " Silence again ; longer than the one before . " I do n't know , " he said , drawing her still closer against him . " But she 's our only hope now . Nothing must happen to ruin her life . She 's our only hope . "  | IN 1873 , NEW YORK had been the first state to adopt the thirtieth of May as a holiday honoring the Civil War dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Memorial Day offered no respite to a theatrical company on tour  --  and that was the case on this last Thursday of May 1889 . While most citizens relaxed and enjoyed a day of leisure , twenty-sevenyear-old Eleanor Goldman , her husband , and the members of their troupe were rattling eastward through the Allegheny mountain valleys in a dingy Pennsylvania Railroad coach . According to Regis Pemberton , the company man- i ager , they were about a half hour from the town in which they were scheduled to give a show that evening . YY The company had been sent on tour by Augustin Daly , one of the half dozen most successful producing managers in the United States . Daly 's Theatre was one of New York City 's best playhouses , and Daly 's productions were almost always hits because he mounted them lavishly , neglected no details , and insisted on absolute personal control of every phase of a show . The newspaper writers called him " the autocrat of the stage " with good reason . Daly was also a prolific playwright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones and adaptations . Eleanor and her husband were touring in a very successful comedy called A Night Off which Daly had adapted from the German of Franz von Schonthan six years before . Tonight 's performance would be professional , but certainly no pleasure , Eleanor thought . She felt tired and depressed this afternoon . She sat by the grimy window , her chin in her palm and her dark eyes fixed on the misty dark green peaks passing slowly above her . An unread letter lay  | in her lap . She was hungry . She 'd overslept and had had no time for breakfast before boarding the train . And when she 'd awakened , her first sight had been an upsetting one ? Leo , standing by the window of their hotel room and gazing out at the streets of Pittsburgh . On his face was a forlorn and faintly bitter expression which was becoming all too familiar . What tricks life can play , she thought then , before he realized she was awake . An outside observer would study the visible evidence and conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth was quite different . Leo sat beside Eleanor , dozing and swaying with the motion of the train as it switchbacked along a track above a racing creek . A few raindrops spattered the window . From two seats behind , one of the actresses sighed , " More rain . That 'll keep the audience at home . " " Maybe not , Minna , " Pemberton said . " This place is supposed to be one of the best theater towns in Pennsylvania . I 've never played here myself , but Daly told me the houses are usually excellent . And the town 's accustomed to springtime floods . People are used to going out in bad weather . " " Seems like it 's been raining all month , " someone else complained . " Wo n't we ever see the sun ? " Pemberton again : " Do n't count on it soon . The Pittsburgh paper said the Signal Service is predicting another big storm today or tomorrow . " His voice blended with that of the company stage manager across the aisle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor character in the play . He was saying to his assistant : " We 've been guaranteed possession of the Opera House by three-thirty . I told them that if we could n't start shifting our scenery by four , there 'd be no performance . The house manager promised to make sure the patriotic program ended on time . Of course the start of the program really depends on when the parade finishes . " " I hope to hell it does n't pour before we arrive , " the assistant grumbled . " If it does , we wo n't be able to find any pick-up laborers . " The voices droned on , punctuated by the sudden loud laugh of an actress reading a copy of the humor magazine , Life . Eleanor wished she could find something to laugh  | about . Leo 's mood made that almost impossible these days . Why could n't she soothe or humor him out of his despondency ? Why , when so many things were going just right for them ? Professionally , their position was enviable . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daly was temperamental , but he tolerated no temperament in his actors and actresses . He also despised the star system , and refused to permit it in his shows . As a director , his chief goal was to achieve an excellent performance by the ensemble . He never permitted one actor to shine at the expense of others . That held true even in New York , where four of the most accomplished performers on the American stage formed the core of Daly 's stock company . The so-called Big Four  --  leading man John Drew , the son of Mrs. Louisa Drew of the Arch Street Theatre , the two comedians Jim Lewis and Mrs. John Gilbert ; and the ingenue Ada Rehan  --  all knew better than to try to upstage one another , or anyone else in the company . Membership in the Daly organization was also desirable because Daly believed in modern acting methods . Like any art , acting was not static ; during the century it had gone through a steady evolution . The first great American star , Edwin Forrest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd started as a disciple of the stately declamatory school of acting popular in Britain . Then he 'd fallen under the influence of the stormy emotional style of Kean . By the time Forrest had done his last season in 1871-72 , that style , too , was passe , and Forrest was dismissed by the avant-garde as a " bovine bellower . " Now a more natural and realistic technique was developing . Men such as James Murdoch and Edwin Booth exemplified it best . Of course there was still an important place for performers who could shift to the style known as extreme emotionalism . Women who could cry copiously on cue were in great demand for the many melodramas staged every year . Once categorized as emotionalistic , however , an actor had few chances to try other kinds of roles . Eleanor had struggled to avoid that kind of pigeonholing by producers . She deliberately sought varied roles . She 'd started her pro-  | fessional career as Eva in a traveling Tom show . She 'd played Juliet , Ophelia and , in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate . She 'd understudied the title role in Camille ; ranted and sobbed in three Daly melodramas ; been menaced by revolvers while defending her virtue in frontier dramas  --  even done knockabout comedy in a revival of Harrigan and Hart 's huge hit of ten years before , The Mulligan Guard Ball . Unlike some of Daly 's performers , she enjoyed all sorts of plays , from ancient to modern . A lot of actors were traditionalists , despising modern playwrights such as Ibsen or Mackaye . Daly 's ingenue Ada Rehan , for example , loathed the work of both men and would appear in nothing that was not light , innocuous , and  --  to use her words  --  morally uplifting . Eleanor did n't quarrel with Ada for holding those views , but she felt sorry for her . Just as there was a new kind of acting emerging , so there was a new , more realistic and powerful dramaturgy . In America its foremost exponent was Steele Mackaye . His play Hazel Kirke , first produced in 1880 , was still widely toured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class characters  --  a shock for audiences accustomed to the convention that serious plays were only set in ancient palaces or upper-class drawing rooms . The new dramatists thrilled and excited Eleanor . The theater was a banquet , and she had no intention of settling for a one-course meal . Despite Eleanor 's efforts to keep from being categorized , it was happening . Like it or not , she was beginning to be thought of as an actress of the personality school . Such actresses developed a personal following ; their audiences paid to see them regardless of the vehicle . Some personality actresses tended to be more than a bit bizarre ; the famed Madame Bernhardt kept a lion cub as a pet and slept in a satin-padded coffin in her Paris apartment . Eleanor abhorred that kind of exhibitionism . Yet it was flattering to be thought of as one who someday might have roles tailored to fit her talents because she , not the play , was the reason the audience came to the theater . Since she and Leo worked regularly , they were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing a personal and professional dream . They 'd started talking about the idea almost ten years before . They wanted to own and  | manage their own playhouse in New York . During seasons with Daly and with Mrs. Drew at Arch Street , they 'd learned the business side of theatrical management . Lately Eleanor had begun to think they were almost ready to stop working for others and start working for themselves . Why , then , with everything going so splendidly , was Leo constantly unhappy ? She knew , of course . The fault was hers . She turned to look at her husband . Her classicallyfeatured , dark-eyed face that men found so beautiful revealed nothing of her worry and unhappiness . She was a good actress . She never permitted herself to show emotion of the kind surging through her now . And no matter how miserable she became , she never cried . Never . Leo was still dozing . Sleep had smoothed away some of the strain on his face . One area of their marriage had n't worked out and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1877 when men had broken into the Kent mansion and driven Margaret Kent to her death , and cornered Eleanor and She clenched her hands in her lap . Fought to blank out the memory of the pain , the humiliation , the incredibly soiled feeling as , one by one , those men No . She would not dwell on it . She closed her eyes and breathed deeply , failing to notice the letter slip out of her lap as she changed position . The moment of strain passed , the details of that harrowing night successfully pushed out of her mind . She opened ' 1 her eyes , noticed the letter on the floor and quickly recovered it . The letter was from Papa 's brother , Uncle Matt ; the man who had first encouraged Eleanor to try a professional stage career . Matt Kent had served as a genial and expert guide when she and Leo had honeymooned in Paris . Among the theaters they 'd visited was the ComedieFrangaise , where Eleanor 's **35;1055;TOOLONG , Marie Charboneau , had performed . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . real news concerned Tom , the son Uncle Matt had  | never seen . Before the boy 's birth , Matt 's estranged wife Dolly  --  of whom he still wrote and spoke in the most affectionate terms  --  had gone out to the North-West Frontier of India as a schoolteacher for officers ' children . Now , Matt said , Tom was hoping for a career as an officer in the Indian Army  --  an organization not to be confused with the British Army in India , he pointed out . Down to the very last soldier of the line , those in the British Army in India were Englishmen . The Indian Army included many nativeborn noncommissioned officers and enlisted men . India was a colorful , if dangerous place to soldier , Uncle Matt concluded . He wanted to visit it and sketch its sights one day . Eleanor suspected that what he really wanted was to get his first look at young Tom . She folded the letter and put it in her reticule . The train was rumbling past shanties and wooden tenements standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent . Across the river , large brick homes perched on a steep hillside , their fronts supported on pilings . The train passed a factory complex . Eleanor recalled Pemberton saying the town 's main industry was steel . But trivial things could n't keep her mind off Leo for very long . They had been married almost four and a half years . In all that time , despite mutual tenderness and consideration for the feelings of the other , they had been unable to solve the problem which was Eleanor 's legacy from that dreadful night in ' 77 . Her father had sensed the existence of the problem . Of course she could n't discuss it with him . But the problem was so serious that discussions with Leo were inevitable . Time and again she told him the difficulty did n't matter . He agreed  --  or pretended to agree  --  then contradicted that attitude a day or so later by another desperate attempt to prove that the problem did n't exist . He always failed . She repeatedly told him the fault was hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that might have convinced him . She could n't open the imaginary door and , by sharing the secret with her husband , destroy its power over her . She simply could not do it . And so Leo 's despondency and bitterness grew steadily worse . Now the train was rolling across a huge stone bridge at least fifty feet wide . The bridge carried four sets of tracks . " Looks like we 're coming in , " Pemberton said . " Our hotel 's  | the Hulbert House . It 's supposed to be the newest in town . Before we left New York , they wired that they were heavily booked . But I think we managed to squeeze everyone in . " " Leo ? " Eleanor tapped his arm . His eyes opened . " We 're here , " she said , leaning over to kiss his closely shaved cheek . In A Night Off , Leo played Marcus Brutus Snap , an eccentric and flamboyant theatrical manager  --  a role far removed from the somber silence with which he regarded her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage from overhead racks . On either side of the train spread a panorama of tenements and business buildings made indistinct by the rain and the dark sky . " Feeling a little more rested ? " she asked . Leo shrugged . " I slept . I do n't think I got much rest . " She held back a retort . Melancholy was becoming a way of life for him . She hated that . She knew he had many more reasons than one for becoming embittered . Yet that understanding did n't make it any easier to live with him . He tugged the brim of his derby down over his forehead , slouched on the seat and stared out the window . What he saw quickly soured his expression : " God . Someone in Pittsburgh told me they manufacture a lot of barbed wire here . A fitting product for such a depressing place . " " Regis said it 's an excellent theater town ? " " Oh , certainly . In this weather I 'm sure we 'll play to all of a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These days he was so unlike the merry , confident , and outgoing Leo Goldman she 'd first met at an amateur theatrical club in New York . He was still handsome . But the frustration caused by their failure to achieve a satisfying physical relationship seemed 1 ' 1 to be eroding his good looks as well as his good spirits . One indicator of his unhappiness was the frequency with which he reminisced about the past . Although he 'd spent his boyhood in poverty on New York 's Lower East Side , he already regarded that boyhood with great nostalgia . Often after a performance , he would lie on the bed in their hotel room , lock his hands under his head and deliver a long , rambling monologue about the days when there had been a mezuzah on the doorpost and pushcarts selling oilcloth , garlic , fish , and a hundred other items in the street . " After  | a skimpy meal , those carts could provide dessert if you were clever and fast . Apples went down your shirt front , bananas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers from Park Row , but there had been moments of relaxation , too ; wonderful moments . There were breathtaking vistas of the city to be seen from tenement rooftops ; bright immies to be won in a marble shoot ; a rubber ball to be solidly whacked in the Hester Street equivalent of a baseball game " Good times . " That was his summation . He 'd been among his own people , not constantly jostling against bigots who turned on him because of his name or his dark , Semitic face . He 'd been full of hope and ambition . She blamed herself for most of his dreams going bad . Pemberton bustled along the aisle of the lamp-lit coach . He was a runty , red-faced man of sixty , inclined to be brusque . Now , though , he sounded like a mother issuing instructions to a brood of children : " Take hacks if they 're available , a trolley if they are n't . It 's the Hulbert House , remember ? " A conductor shouted the name of the town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were twenty in the company traveling in the coach : five men and five women who took the principal roles in the play , plus musicians , scenery and property people , the stage manager , his assistant , and Pemberton . One of the musicians had evidently played the town before : " ? that 's the Little Conemaugh out that way , and the Stonycreek there . The two rivers meet just above that stone bridge we crossed . What I do n't like about the place is the dam . It 's fourteen or fifteen miles up the south branch of the Little Conemaugh , and four hundred feet higher than the town . " " What 's wrong with that ? " someone wanted to know . " It 's an earth dam . Largest in the world , and the reservoir behind it is the biggest artificial lake in the country . The dam holds back four and a half billion gallons of water . That 's twenty million tons . I guess the dam was safe once , but now it 's leaky as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't someone fix it ? " a young woman asked . " Laissez-faire , my dear Ellen . Laissez-faire . The dam was  | built forty or fifty years ago , as part of a rail and canal system connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburgh . When the system became obsolete , the land near the dam was put up for sale . Now the reservoir 's called Lake Conemaugh , and on the shore there 's a private fishing and hunting club for the Pittsburgh swells . The Mellons , Carnegie , Frick  --  that crowd . No one 's going to tell them how to run their businesses or maintain their property . They refuse to repair the dam . I 'm glad we 're not staying here any longer than one Pem " berton interrupted with a hard tap on the shoulder : " That 's enough , Waldo . The weather 's doing a fine job of depressing everybody . Do n't help out with scare stories . " I " It 's no story , Regis . That dam 's been in wretched shape for ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician said , turning away with a sullen shrug . Eleanor knew Pemberton 's edict was not just a whim . A company 's mood had a significant effect on a performance ; ' subtle influences could result in a superlative show , or a drab one . And audiences were quick to sense when a company was n't up to the mark . She saw no enthusiasm in the company this afternoon . The gloomy weather and the drab town had destroyed it little by little ; Waldo 's comments had n't helped , either . Voices grew subdued as the train slowed for the depot . The I women readied parasols that would n't be of much use it against the rain beginning to fall heavily outside . The sky ' , II had grown so dark , it might have been dusk instead of midafternoon . Lamps had already been lit in the station . As she and Leo prepared to leave the coach , she heard a second , somewhat louder noise above the drum of the rain . " What on earth is that roaring ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tone made her shiver and recall his remark about the dam : Now its leaky as a sieve . The Goldmans stepped down on the wet platform . Leo pointed . " Look at that . " Beyond the depot , a red , white , and black three-sheet billboard was visible in the falling rain . The three-sheet advertised the evening 's performance at the Opera House  | with a mammoth capital-letter heading which Leo read aloud : " Intensely funny . ' Surely they ca n't mean us . " No one smiled . Pemberton scowled . It did n't promise to be a successful engagement , and it was certainly a wretched way to spend Memorial Day . What Eleanor saw of the town only depressed her further . The main business district was situated on a triangle of land bounded by the two noisy streams . From the steep , dark hillsides , homes of the wellto-do looked down on the commercial buildings , and on shanties and tenements along the rivers , which were already close to overflowing their banks . The rain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the name of this gloomy place ? " Leo pointed to the dripping depot sign . PEMBERTON SENT THE STAGE manager to the Opera House to check on the progress of the Memorial Day program . Hacks proved to be nonexistent around the depot . So did trolleys . Pemberton left two men at the station to arrange for transportation of the scenery , then he and the others trudged through the downtown carrying their own luggage . By the time they reached the four-story Hulbert House at Clinton and Main Streets , nearly a mile of walking had left them soaked and in a bad temper . Leo carried both his valise and Eleanor 's . He sneezed loudly several times . Finally she asked if he felt all right . " Marvelous . I do this for my health all the time . "  | She tried to cover him with a parasol that offered little 1 protection . He pushed it away . The hotel was sturdy , elegant , and obviously new . Leo I did n't like to stand in line , so he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others had signed the ledger and claimed their keys . Then they approached the desk . PemBerton was at the front door , conferring with the man he 'd III sent to the Opera House . The holiday program would n't end till about four-fifteen . Pemberton 's curse could be heard all the way across the lobby . " Goldman , Mr. and Mrs. , " Leo said at the marble counter . They traveled under their married name but at the ' theater Eleanor was always billed under her maiden name . It was as Eleanor Kent that she received bouquets and 1 written invitations from men in the audience who did n't realize she was married . Displeasing her with his morbid-11 ity , Leo sometimes joked that if he died , her suitors would 1II attend his funeral . Leo exploded : " Our manager made reservations for the entire company weeks ago ! " " Be that as it may ? " The clerk 's eyelids drooped as he shrugged . " We have nothing . " Leo gripped the edge of the counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our last name was Smith ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " You heard me , you lying fraud . " The clerk stepped back . " I 'm not required to listen to that sort of ? " " Goldman , Goldman ? " the buck-toothed clerk studied some card or paper beneath the counter . Eleanor stepped up next to her husband , a wary look in her eyes . This had the smell of something familiar and infuriating . The clerk turned around to examine the pigeonholes containing room keys . After a moment he pivoted back to face them . " I 'm afraid I just rented the last room , Mr. Goldman . We have nothing left . "  | " Some trouble here ? " Pemberton said , bustling up to them . Eleanor spun to face him . " The hotel does n't have enough rooms . At least not enough for us . " " Regrettably , we are one short , " the clerk told Pemberton . His face showed a pious regret . But his narrow brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face to the swelling curve of Eleanor 's breast . " This is disgraceful , " Pemberton said . " Artists are n't accustomed to being treated in this fashion . We were assured by telegraph that your establishment could accommodate my entire troupe . " " Well , someone made a mistake . And I do n't have to stand here and be insulted by this Je  --  this gentleman . If you want to take your troupe somewhere else , feel free to do so . We wo n't suffer bankruptcy , I assure you . " He turned sharply and disappeared into his cubicle . Pemberton whacked his soft hat against his plaid trouser leg . Dismayed , he eyed the lobby . All the others had disappeared , anxious to reach their rooms and change to dry clothes . One fat guest sat with a newspaper in his lap and a smoldering cigar in his mouth . The man 's head was exceptionally large ; too large even for his obese body . Protruding eyes added a final touch of ugliness . The man had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his cigar as he studied Eleanor 's face . A moment later he heaved himself up from his chair and waddled around a pillar where he fell into conversation with someone the pillar concealed . " We 'll all go somewhere else ? " Pemberton began . " And turn everyone out into the rain again ? " Eleanor shook her head . " That is n't necessary . " " But if we stay , we 're condoning ? " " Never mind , Regis , " Leo interrupted . " Eleanor 's right . It would be all right to protest if it were n't raining , but the others are worn out . Let them stay . We 're used to this kind of reception . " And in truth so was the company manager . He was only one of many who 'd urged Leo to Anglicize his last name .  | Even Gideon had made the suggestion to Eleanor . But the one time she 'd mentioned it to Leo , he had lost his temper . ' Ever since the attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with slights or insults caused by his being " ' Jewish . With bleak humor , he often said it was easier for Christians to turn the other cheek because the first one did n't get pummeled and spat on like the cheek of a Jew . Eleanor slipped her arm in his , picking up her valise with her other hand . " Do n't worry about us , Regis . We 'll find another hotel . " Leo nodded . " There must be one in town that is n't run by bigots . " He said it loudly , so that the clerk in his cubicle was sure to hear . A clearing of a throat said he had . Leo smiled in a humorless way , then snatched up the other valise with a suddenness that betrayed his suppressed rage . They walked toward the street entrance . Eleanor 's trayeling cape and skirt were sodden and she was bone-cold. 11I Leo sneezed again , then a third time . Pemberton called after them : " Do n't walk in this weather . Find a hack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll reimburse l you from company funds . " " Thank you , Regis , " Eleanor called back . It was a kind offer but a futile one . They all knew no hacks were operat-ing in the downpour . As they passed the pillar , they came upon the fat fellow and the man to whom he 'd been talking  --  a thin , whitehaired porter in rank overalls . Three steps more , and the Goldmans had nearly reached the street door . Suddenly Eleanor heard the fat man snicker and reply to a question . A few words of his heavily accented English carried clearly : " ? sure he 's a kike , ca n't you tell ? Gross gott ! It 's almost as shameful as a white woman giving herself to a nigger . " Leo dropped his valise and whirled . " Leo , do n't , he is n't worth it ! " Eleanor exclaimed . But 8 her husband was already stalking toward the fat German , who had turned gray as oatmeal . Leo poured out invective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , momentarily puffed up by anger , brandished his cigar and shouted :  | t " Do n't swear at me in your heathen tongue , you black sheeny ! " Leo 's cheeks turned plum colored . He kept walking . In a panic , the fat man jabbed his lighted cigar at Leo 's left eye . t Eleanor clapped a hand to her mouth . But Leo was t quick . The cigar 's glowing end only came within a couple of inches of his face . He seized the fat man 's forearm with t both hands and pushed . The man could move the cigar no closer . Leo squeezed the German 's arm . The man 's hand opened . The cigar fell out , hit the carpet and rolled . Leo kept applying pressure to the arm . The fat man gasped curses in German . Tears began to run from the corners of his eyes . He dropped to his knees , moaning and pleading for mercy in his native tongue . Leo did n't release him . The fat man kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clerk peeked out from his cubicle . A twist of strong-smelling smoke was rising beside Leo 's muddy left shoe . He pointed to the burning circle in the carpet and called to the clerk : " Your rug 's on fire . Maybe this gentleman will help put it out . " He seized the back of the fat man 's collar and hurled him down . The man 's chest crushed the hot cigar . He floundered , squirmed , squealed like a girl Leo grabbed Eleanor 's arm , practically jerking her to the door . " Maybe it 'll rain forty days and forty nights and wash this benighted place off the map . " " Do n't say that , Leo . Not even as a joke . That man does n't represent the whole town . " " I 'd like to think not . But I wonder . " Luggage in hand , they lowered their heads and went through the door into the downpour . Although it was only late afternoon , the sky was almost completely black . Behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard ! If I see you again , you 're in for it . You better not stay in Johnstown or they 'll ship you out in little pieces ! " Hard rain battered Eleanor 's face as they headed up the street . Sometimes she felt a flash of pride when Leo stood up to the kind of witless bigot they 'd just encountered . Yet  | what did you really gain when you offered resistance ? Only i trouble and more trouble  --  and you changed nothing . But she could never persuade Leo of that now . She 'd lost j that battle after Papa Goldman had visited Philadelphia . I ? The fat man had lumbered to the lobby window . He pounded the window frame and continued to shout . Were the threats merely bluster , or something to worry about ? She did n't know , but she did n't care to learn . THEY FOUND A ROOM at the Penn Ho-tel , four blocks from the Hulbert House . The room was cramped and shabbily furnished . A few sticks of kindling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet the only light . One small window overlooked an alley that re-sembled a river in flood . The storm showed no signs of stopping . An hour after they checked in , Leo was down the hall in the bathroom used by all guests on their floor . Eleanor was finishing a note to their friend and sometime employer , Louisa Drew . She had loosened her hair . It hung over her shoulders and down her back , long and dark and glossy . As she wrote , she snuggled deeper into the garment she always took along when she traveled  --  an old , faded cotton flannel I ' robe of Leo 's , much too large but exceptionally comfort- able and warm . She 'd decided years ago that she would never make a society woman for a variety of reasons . One was her almost complete lack of interest in clothes . A large , expensive wardrobe simply was n't important to her . She 'd often been told that she looked stunning in the lavish gowns provided for some of her stage roles . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiar ones like the disreputable robe , which she wore with nothing underneath . Leo walked in , drying the back of his neck with a worn towel . His robe was much like hers , but somewhat newer . Suddenly he sneezed loudly . " Oh , Leo , you 're catching something . " " The Johnstown grippe . In this kind of weather who could avoid it ? " He stretched on the bed in the familiar position , hands laced under his head . He closed his eyes . Another melancholy monologue about to begin ? Eleanor kept her head bent over her writing to conceal her disappointment . All at once Leo coughed and opened his eyes ; something was on his mind . She signed the note , folded it , and smiled at him . He smiled too , but in a wan sort of way . He jumped up and stalked to the window . Eleanor turned in her chair , watching him . As she changed position , the robe 's lapels fell away from her deep cleavage . She clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for warmth . The kindling in the fireplace had nearly burned away . A roach went scurrying along the baseboard beside the bed . She took notice without being unduly upset ; she and Leo had stayed in far worse places . Leo eyed the streaming window . " The theater 's liable to float away by eight o'clock . But in case it does n't , I should go over those lines I had so much trouble with last night . " So that was it ; he was fretting about his performance again . Well , that was better than longing for a past that would never return . " Which lines do you mean ? " " Third act . Where Snap 's describing how the professor 's play failed . " She looked dubious . " I 'd hardly say you had trouble . I noticed a moment 's hesitation , that 's aIl . " " It was more than that , " he shot back . " I paraphrased half a dozen words . It threw my timing completely off . " Eleanor said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependable actor ; one whom other actors trusted and enjoyed being with on stage . But that same perfectionism played its part in many of his personal disappointments . He expected too much of himself , of others , and the world . He always expected relationships to be flaw-  | less , and his career , and Eleanor 's , to be free of major difficulties . Was there such a thing as being too idealistic ? she wondered . He walked to the bureau , there rummaging among personal articles they 'd unpacked and put away . She reached under the note lying in her lap : " I have the bikhl , if that 's what you 're searching for . " She held up the frayed playscript . She 'd picked un his habit of referring to it by the Yiddish word for small book . Leo had prepared the script by hand . It contained the dialogue for the entire play ; normally , actors were issued only their own scenes . He laboriously wrote out a similar playbook for every show in which they appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she added . " Let me find the page ? " One of the plot lines of A Night Off dealt with Marcus Brutus Snap 's attempt to make a killing by producing a classical tragedy written by a college professor named Babbit , who taught in a town where Snap 's troupe was playing . The production was a catastrophe , and in the scene Leo wanted to rehearse , Snap was bemoaning the result of some scenic improvisation : a borrowed parrot in a tubbed orange tree had been part of the stage decoration for a scene in ancient Rome  --  for no very clear reason . " Here it is , " Eleanor said . There were several characters on stage with Snap in the scene . She lowered her voice to read the line of the first to speak , a doctor : " How is it going ? ' " Leo sat on the edge of the bed , immediately in character as the manager whose production had just met with ca-tastrophe : " It 's all over . It 's all over ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew it ! ' " Leo clutched his heart . " When I think of this happening to me in my old age ? ! ' " She struggled to keep from smiling as she read the next line : " Tell us all about it . ' " " I 've been a manager twenty-five years , but I never had such a failure as that ! ' " Again she was the disappointed playwright . " How did it end ? ' "  | " How did it end ? It ended in a riot , that 's how it ended ! ' " " A  --  a riot ? ' " " We had to ring down in the middle of the second act ! I never heard such hissing and whistling on a railroad train ! ' " Leo jumped up , waving his arms ; his personation of the flamboyant , excitable manager made her laugh aloud . " The audience jumped up and down like madmen  --  but the tragedy was not all to blame . Half the calamity was your fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree that capped the climax . Picture the pine grove in the second act  --  Cassius had just come on , and the audience was quiet . I was standing in the center ? ' " He took a long step toward the window . " ? as King Titus Tatius , with my arms folded just so ? ' " He folded them with great exaggeration . " ? glaring at the Roman soldiers . My wife had just finished Virgia 's great speech , defying the haughty Romulus ? ' " Leo pitched his voice much higher , raising one finger as he declaimed : " What would'st thou , king ? Thy stubborn silence break ? what would'st thou , tyrant ? Answer . Speak ! ' " He looked at Eleanor . " Then your confounded parrot squeaked at the top of his voice ? ' " He flung his arms wide and went falsetto : " Kiss me , darling ! ' " Eleanor burst out laughing again . " Oh , Leo , you 're wonderful . Absolutely wonderful ! " He dropped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A little better ? Letter perfect ! " He walked to her side ; put his hands on her shoulders and leaned down . " Undoubtedly that 's because I have such a fine dialogue coach this afternoon . Thank you , Madam Goldman ? " He planted a chaste kiss on her forehead . " But we both know where the genuine talent lies in this family . " " Now , Leo , please do n't start that . " She raised the playbook . " Do you want to go over it again ? " He ignored the book . " It 's true , though . I realized it years ago . I 'm a competent actor  --  sometimes even a good one  --  but there are thousands and thousands of those . You  | have talent and something else . You have that rare quality of holding every eye the moment you enter a room or walk onto a stage . It ca n't be learned and it ca n't be bought and only a very few possess it . The truth is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should capitalize on it ? " His right hand strayed to her face ; his knuckles moved gently back and forth along her cheek . That and the expression in his eyes told her that he was falling into one of his despondent moods . He continued to stroke her cheek slowly . " You should use that gift to attract a more suitable husband . Some goyische nabob with a lot of money and a talent for getting more . " She slapped his wrist lightly with the script . " Leo Goldman , I do n't want to hear you talk that way . " " Why not ? " His face bleak , he turned toward the window . " I 've given you damn little , Eleanor . When I was a boy  --  long before I ever met you  --  I ran into your father one winter night on Printing House Square . " " Yes , he 's often told me the story . " If he heard , he gave no indication ; he seemed to be staring straight through her : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant to make my fortune in America . I predicted that very blithely at the time . You notice I hardly ever predict it these days . I have n't made a fortune and I never will . " " No one who goes into the theater expects to get rich . Not unless you move from acting into managing and producing , and even then it 's chancy . We 've always known that . " " But you really could do much better when it comes to a husband . You could easily find one who is n't turned away from good hotels . One who does n't drag you down to mediocrity with ? " " Leo , do n't ! " He inhaled sharply , shrugged and leaned on the window sill , staring at the rain . He no longer looked handsome , only tired and defeated . Eleanor 's eyes shone with anger . How she loathed these dark , self-pitying moods . They filled her with a special frustration because she was incapable of talking him out of them . She supposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
