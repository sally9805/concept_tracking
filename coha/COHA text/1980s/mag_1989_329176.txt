The man at the right may look like he 's only feeding a giraffe , but he 's actually lunching with a source . Acacia branches in hand , Los Angeles correspondent James Willwerth befriended Kito for this week 's Living story on the renaissance of the American zoo . Over the course of eight weeks Willwerth petted a walrus in Tacoma , walked ankle deep in freezing snow in the company of several hundred penguins in San Diego and held ( gingerly ) a tarantula in Cincinnati . <P> As he talked to the human beings who run the zoos , Willwerth was especially impressed by the dedication that curators feel to their quite modestly paid jobs . He was also drawn into the difficult issues of animal management . Says Willwerth : " Listening to complex discussions of gene pools , habitat destruction , medical problems , immersion landscapes and zoo politics is surprisingly compelling . " <P> Willwerth became a lover of wildlife when he watched a Walt Disney film about South America 's big jungle cats at the local movie house in his hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger Tops resort , in Nepal 's Royal Chitwan National Park , and game preserves in East Africa as well as the penguin protectorates located on the South Australian coast . " This assignment brought out both the conservationist and the kid in me , " he says . <P> His most memorable moment came when he strolled with the penguins at San Diego 's Sea World . The emperor and king penguins occasionally proved less than hospitable to their new companion . Standing hip high , with beaks the size of small kitchen knives , the penguins repeatedly tried to jab Willwerth 's legs . Fortunately , the Sea World curator managed to rescue TIME 's roving correspondent before any damage was done . As for feeding Kito , Willwerth can not remember another source that ate quite so quickly . His only challenge remains how to list an acacia tree on his expense account .
