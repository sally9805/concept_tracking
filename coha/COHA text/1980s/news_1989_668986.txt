This was supposed to be a massacre . It was St. Valentine ' s Day , after all , and Notre Dame was going up against a 9-12 Boston College team that had lost eight in a row , was only 1-9 in the Big East Conference and had suffered an 86-49 drubbing to Connecticut its last trip out . The banks of empty seats in Notre Dame ' s Joyce Center before the game told you this was supposed to be a sleeper . Instead , the Irish ( 14-5 ) handed their guests a Valentine ' s Day card Tuesday-an 83-72 upset . And less than a month before the invitations to the NCAA Tournament come out , too . It was the arcing three-point Hail Mary jumpers of the Eagles ' Dana Barros that did the most damage . Barros , who leads the Big East in scoring ( 22. 7 points a game ) , finished with 30 points , while teammate Steve Benton had a career-high 29 . " The bottom line is that tonight they outplayed us , " said Irish co-captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . He used his screens . He got his shots off , and he hit the big shots in the clutch . " " I thought Barros and Benton took the game over , " said Irish coach Digger Phelps . " They just dominated the game . Give those guys the credit . " There were no saints for Notre Dame this day . Freshman LaPhonso Ellis was held to eight points . Jackson ( 18 points ) hit three of three three-pointers in the first 5 minutes to spark the Irish to an early 20-11 lead , but he missed four in the second half when the Irish needed them desperately . Irish guard Daimon Sweet arrived like a box of candy off the bench , hitting a cool jumper to put the Irish up 20-11 with 12 : 25 to go . But the taste got suddenly bitter as he then missed a jumper , was called for charging and threw the ball away in three straight successions . Barros hit a jumper to start the Eagles on a nine-point run to tie it at 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , but it was clear Boston College had taken all the momentum away . Joe Fredrick ( 22 points ) tried to lead a late charge , but the Irish were just flat . The Irish shot only 44 percent for the game and were outrebounded 37-29 . " We only had five offensive rebounds . That ' s not going to win it for you when you shoot only 27 for 61 , " said Phelps . " That was definitely a game we needed , " said Jackson . " We ' re going to have to beat some people in the next nine games if we ' re going to get into the ( NCAA ) tournament . " Phelps and Boston College coach Jim O ' Brien agreed afterwards that a 2-minute stretch at the end of the first half was the key to the game . With the Eagles up 36-34 , Phelps took out his two big men , Ellis and Keith Robinson , to get them some rest . The Eagles responded with six straight points to pull up by eight just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish back to within six ( 42-36 ) before the buzzer , but the Irish never could get the full momentum back in the second half .
