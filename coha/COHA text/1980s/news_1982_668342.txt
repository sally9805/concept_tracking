In 1975 , there was romance . A 27-year-old conscientious objector , wearing a tattered fishnet shirt with the letters GBTC stenciled across the front in magic marker , won the Boston Marathon in an American record time of 2 hours , 9 minutes and 55 seconds . We immediately learned that he and his girlfriend Ellen lived in a crummy apartment in Jamaica Plain , supported by her salary and food stamps , while he worked toward a masters degree in special education at Boston College . His name was Bill Rodgers and his victory christened a special year in Boston sports . After a local son won the Marathon for the first time since 1945 , the Red Sox won their first pennant in eight years and played perhaps the best World Series in baseball history , while the Celtics embarked on a season that would net their 12th world championship . Meanwhile , Bill Rodgers was innocence , poverty and vulnerability . We believed . Today he is Bill Rodgers , Inc. , the Babe Ruth of road running , president of a finanacial empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , winning , wearing certain products and/or selling his own line or sportswear . He owns four stores , which grossed at least $1 million lastyear , plus a worldwide clothing line that grossed more than $3 million . He is divorced from Ellen , lives in a house in safe , suburban Sherborn , and his masters degree gathers dust in the attic . For the money , he gives you a run . " Some part of the running population is put off because Bill is running for the money and little else but the money , " says Amby Burfoot , Rodgers ' Wesleyan rooomate and a former Boston Marathon winner ( 1968 ) . " But it ' s only fair to say in his defense that if I were in his position , I ' d also be running for the money . " Certainly Bill ' s life has changed , but my basic impression is that it ' s impossible for him to ever change . " Rodgers looks the same . He still wears the quizzical expression of a man who just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still signs autographs for two hours and answers questions candidly and politely . Leaving business matters to his family , friends and agent ( Mark McCormack International Management ) , he still makes appointments by scribbling reminders onto the palm of his hand . " I ' m the same person , " Rodgers says as he prepares for his ninth Boston Marathon April 19 . " I love the competition , I love running . I run basically for the same reasons . When I ' m 83 and can ' t get paid , when I won ' t get the big bucks , I ' ll still always want to run . True , money now affects which races I run , but I don ' t feel I ' m totally sacrificing my running for a buck . " He is , after all , running Boston , where the pay is a wink from a Wellesley co-ed , a bowl of beef stew and a half cup of holy grace . " I ' m getting zerofrom Boston , " says Rodgers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were good for 50 bills ( $50,000 ) . " Thinking about it for a moment , he adds , " I ran one anyway . Korea . But I didn ' t run both , so I ' m not totally a mercenary at all times . " Marathon men at home and abroad believe that Rodgers runs too much . He ran in 35 road races in 1981 , including five marathons . Three top marathons a year is considered the limit for serious runners . In January , he ran the Houston marathon and finished fifth . A week later he ran a marathon in Tokyo and finished 34th . He ran Korea ( 2:28 ) two weeks ago and participated in the Cherry Blossom run in Washington ( 10 miles , placed second in 49:37 ) last weekend . " I race more than anybody in the country at a world-class level , " he boasts . However , facts show that Rodgers has diluted his talent and times by running so frequently . After three years as the top-ranked marathoner in the world ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped out of the top 10 last year . He is ranked seventh at the moment , but there are times when he runs a race without taking off his sweats and simply goes through the motions . There are times when what you ' re seeing isn ' t Bill Rodgers . He is 34 years old and says , " I think I have a few years left in which I can run from 2:09 to 2:12 , possibly until I ' m 40 . But I ' d have to concentrate on a particular race . It ' s tough to do that many . The quality diminishes . " The quality diminishes . Imagine Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela trying to start every other day . It would be a smash at the gate , but fans never would see the real Fernando . Mom ' s apple pies taste great at Thanksgiving and Christmas , but watch the crust crumble when you ask her to crank out 20 in one week for a church bazaar . Looking to Boston , Rodgers says , " I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was third ( 2:10:34 ) . I ' d be very happy with a 2:10 . A 2:10 could win , especially if Al ( Alberto Salazar ) doesn ' t run . " Salazar is the new boy wonder of a sport that Bill Rodgers carried from country roads to The Tavern On The Green . Like tennis ' Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors , Rodgers spawned a generation of methodical monsters who await their chance to grab the king ' s laurel wreath . It was Salazar who finally snatched Rodgers ' American marathon record , setting a world record with a 2:08:13 in New York last fall . Burfoot speaks for all aging runners when he says , " There are so many more Salazars coming up out there . " Bill Rodgers is part of reason there are so many of them . Typically unaware of himself , in 1980 Rodgers wrote , " I was never very impressed by the traditional figures of American sports , such as Babe Ruth , Mickey Mantle or Bob Cousy . " Today , he is one of the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , with his best running behind him , Rodgers still manages to be bigger than some of the events he participates in . Olympic gold-medal winner ( 1972 ) Frank Shorter peaked too early . Bill Rodgers , winner of nine major marathons in the middle and late ' 70s ( four Bostons , four New Yorks and oneFukuoka ) , was The Name when the American running boom exploded . Tommy Leonard , ombudsman of local road running and a devoted disciple of Rodgers ' , says , " Billy personalized the marathon . He ' s almost mystical . He is mystical . Bill Rodgers should run for president . This is a guy who ran in Rio last year , running sub 5- minute miles for 20 miles singing The Girl From Ipanema . ' That ' s what he is to me . " Burfoot is more realistic about the demands placed on Rodgers and says , " I think that I don ' t know Bill Rodgers in 1982 , and I make it a habit to keep out of his life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the unfortunate realities of wealth and celebrity . " I don ' t have as much time as I ' d like to have , " says Rodgers , " but it ' s not always going to be this way . " Meanwhile , he knows that his earning potential is at its peak , and he fully intends to make the most of it . " I ' m still greedy enough and competitive enough . I want more , " he says . " Other runners want a slice of the financial pie , too . The financial pie is big because of the running boom . " What about the purity and poverty of Harold Abrahams , Eric Liddell and " Chariots of Fire " ? " I ' ve been running since 1963 , and I didn ' t get one cent until 1975 , " says Rodgers . " There is a crazy myth that exists - that top athletes in running never get paid for their efforts . I guess it ' s because of the Olympic tie-ins - to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s all embellishment . It ' s a Hollywood concept we ' ve had to live with . " Since 1975 , Rodgers has been a ready spokesman for America ' s amateur athletes . In 1980 , he blasted President Carter ' s Olympic boycott , and he long has been a critic of The Athletic Congress ( TAC ) , formerly the Amateur Athletic Union ( AAU ) . New rules governing amateur status , rules that are slighlty less complex that the blueprints for the space shuttle , allow runners to take prize money and clinic money and use it for " training purposes . " " I still don ' t understand all the rules , " says Rodgers with a laugh . " But I am technically an amateur , and that ' s one of the great jokes of running . " Rodgers dropped out of the 1981 New York marathon the night before the race because of " financial aspects . " He got a letter from a man who thought lack of money was a bad reason for refusing to run . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a prestigious race , wrote the man . " These people have no perception of what I do , " says Rodgers . " I invite them to slip on my shoes and come with me for a week . Most would drop dead . " However , he admits , " when the sport was up and coming , I had a real drive to win . I ' ve won enough , and I ' m kind of beaten down . I ' m not as single-minded as I used to be . I used to train 130 miles a week . Now , I ' m down to 110 . I have too much to do now . " Rodgers sees himself becoming more selective . " I don ' t have to do everything anymore , " he says . " I don ' t have to run in a race in Los Angeles if I don ' t want to . If somebody wants to take me to lunch , I don ' t have to go . I don ' t need a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry years .
