An all-party parliamentary select committee on the environment came out with a blistering attack Wednesday on the country ' s controversial nuclear complex at Sellafield here in northwest England. // The committee said discharges from the Sellafield plant had made the Irish Sea ' ' the most radioactive stretch of water in the world . ' ' The committee , which compared Sellafield with plants in other countries , called the waste disposal arrangements at Sellafield ' ' amateurish , haphazard , and ad hoc. // // The report could inhibit an industry that is already two years behind schedule as it awaits a government decision on whether or not to go ahead with another nuclear power station on England ' s opposite coast. // The committee had started its inquiry long before four leaks had occurred at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant over a five week period this year. // The report is certain to increase the public clamor to close down Sellafield , a possibility that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has so far refused to consider . The government has been sensitive , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allay public uneasiness over Sellafield , it recently sent in a team of government safety experts to monitor the plant . The experts could insist that parts of the plant close down or that much stricter safety standards be enforced. // The arrival of the safety experts - which preceeded the publication of the parliamentary report by several weeks - came in response to a spate of damaging publicity. // The European Parliament has already called for Sellafield to close down , and Ireland has registered strong protests at the amount of radioactive waste discharged into the Irish Sea . The Irish government has been angered by British attempts to play down recent accidents at Sellafield as ' ' trivial. ' ' // The parliamentary committee recommended that ' ' new numerical liquid discharge limits , radically lower than the current one , should be set for all nuclear plants in the United Kingdom. ' ' // British Nuclear Fuels Limited , a wholly government-owned company , was described as being ' ' out of step with the rest of the world ' ' and a ' ' byword for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of only two full-cycle nuclear power plants in the world , importing spent fuel from Western Europe and Japan and reprocessing it into enriched reusable uranium , plutonium which is used in the production of nuclear weapons , and a greatly reduced amount of radioactive waste. // The report casts a long shadow over plans to construct another plant at Sizewell in Suffolk County . Unlike Britain ' s first stage Magnox ( magnesium oxide ) nuclear power stations , and its second stage advanced gas-cooled reactors , Sizewell would operate based on the United States pressurized water reactor system . It would be the first of its kind in Britain. // While the outcome to an inquiry into building Sizewell is awaited , hardly a week goes by without the news media highlighting yet another radiation leak or some failure to undertake more stringent security checks at the Sellafield site. // Among the most damaging revelations about Sellafield was the government ' s recent admission that discharges of radioactive material at the facility between 1952 and 1955 were 40 times higher than stated at the time of an inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks in February and March - some admittedly minor - the New Scientist , Britain ' s leading science magazine , began asking , ' ' Is this the end of the line for Sellafield ? ' ' // Although the New Scientist has added its voice to a rising chorus of demands to close down Sellafield , the government seems determined that Britain should remain in the business of reprocessing spent fuel. // The government believes that many of the media reports are blown out of proportion , and that when it comes to accidents and actual fatalities , the nuclear industry in Britain emerges with a better record than either the chemical industry or the fuel-related coal and gas industries. // Jake Kelly , manager of information services at Sellafield , is also critical of sensational and ignorant media reporting of a highly technical industry . ' ' We ' ve had horrific stories about the ' village of the damned ' . . . and green spiders climbing out of the plutonium pipes . The only reason is to frighten the life out of people. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limited too easily shrugs off serious criticisms or downgrades their importance. // One report indicates that the rate of leukemia among children in the nearby village of Seascale was 10 times the national average. // Critics of the nuclear power industry also claim that the government wants to play down fears about the industry because reprocessing has become such a lucrative business. // As the world ' s leading commercial producer of reprocessed fuel , British Nuclear Fuels has reprocessed in excess of 26 , 000 tons of fuel since 1952 . Apart from Sellafield , the only other known commercial reprocessing plant in the world is at Cap La Hague in France . It is a much smaller reprocessing plant than Sellafield. // As a result of transporting and reprocessing spent fuel from Japan , Sellafield has become Britain ' s largest yen earner . And this could increase in the future . Sellafield has received a ( STR ) 1. 7 billion pound ( $2. 5 billion ) advance payment from Japan to build a more sophisticated reprocessing facility . The plant , known as a THORP ( Thermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to come on stream in 1991. // Right now the focus of the safety experts ' attention at Sellafield will be on Building 205 , which was built in the 1960s . Here , stripped fuel rods are dissolved in nitric acid , and plutonium and enriched uranium are separated from the spent nuclear fuel. // But on Feb. 5 an ' ' amber alert ' ' sounded in the building when plutonium mist escaped from a pump undergoing repairs . Fifteen workers were contaminated . Amber alert is the first warning in a three-stage alert system. // The safety audit , which promises an independent impartial survey , could give the plant a clean bill of health . If it does , it would go a long way toward removing the cloud of distrust that hangs over Sellafield. // // //
