txt ? I am a pilot with Delta Mr Lines , . and I have deep gratitude for the professional air controllers who are keeping the airline system running during the strike . The air traffic control system is just es safe , if not safer , as kever , has been . The No , 1 controllers are more directly involved now than they evel ? have been with the everyday operation of the system ; The controllers are more cautious than ever , Furthermore , I knout that I and my fellow professional pilots would not even consider taking an aircraft off the ground if we ' thought that flying safety was being compromised the least little bit . At one time I was sympathetic to most of the controllers ' causes , but it is difficult In have any sympathy for a group of lawbreakers . Let 's face it . Maybe the law is not right ; maybe the law should be changed so they would have the right to strike . I do n't think so , The law might be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the parties would sit down and negotiate and abide by binding irbitration . I 'm the first one to admit that I do n't have all the answers . No one does . The strikers are sure seeking them in the , wrong way . ? One dues not ask for the moon and then turn around and go out on an illegal strike . That 's not right . Look at all the grief ' that the strikers are causing so many people . That 's not nice . If you are going to do something , ? do it with class . Besides , being a very misled group of very nice folks , they are doing the labor movement a grave injustice .
