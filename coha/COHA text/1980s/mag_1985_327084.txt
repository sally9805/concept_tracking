In recent years , many biographers learned their art in the School of Debunking . But accounts of past lives have yielded to a more generous and appreciative discipline , which has led to opposite excesses . For declaring Prince Albert " comparable to Thomas Jefferson " and for insisting that Queen Victoria 's Prince Consort " merits a volume as architect , designer , farmer , and naturalist , " Robert Rhodes James earns highest marks in the Warts Can Be Beautiful School of Biography . <P> Even so , it is useful to have this work as a long-overdue antidote to Lytton Strachey 's sneering , unfair attack in Queen Victoria ( 1921 ) . Prince Francis Charles Augustus Albert Emmanuel of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was , for one thing , strikingly handsome  --  possessed of a " beautiful nose " and " fine teeth , " as Victoria noted in 1836 when the two cousins , both 16 , first met . He was a dutiful , romping father . He taught the art of the somersault . He played with kites . He enjoyed having nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . <P> Certainly they were a love match , as royal marriages go . Nonetheless , Rhodes James is forced to report , they did have their scenes . She could fly into rages and overwhelm Albert with accusations of " want of trust , ambition , envy , etc. etc . " About ambition , the Queen may have been right . The Prince 's first tutor observed of Albert , " To do something was with him a necessity . " He formed an alliance with the Tories , thereby becoming the last occupant of Buckingham Palace to meddle in partisan politics . But despite reading and annotating Foreign Office papers until he dropped , the Prince had a modest reputation that rested on other accomplishments . Rhodes James calls him " the greatest Chancellor Cambridge University has ever had . " <P> Fair enough ; he did bring Cambridge 's medieval curriculum into the 19th century to suit his taste for math and the sciences . Nor was that all . Albert initiated the Crystal Palace exhibition of modern industry , as of 1851 . He fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He composed music for the Duke of Wellington 's funeral . He managed a lot of little things well . Yet even this doting biographer concedes that he was " excessively conscientious on quite minor matters . " Albert died at 42 , almost as much from overwork as from influenza . <P> The eyes staring out of his portraits are those of a private and somewhat lonely man whose fate was to suffer double exile : as a public figure in a foreign land . It was as if he had been sentenced for life to be a Prince and Buckingham Palace was his prison . In a touching letter to his brother , he spoke his heart : " In a small house there is more cheerfulness to be found than there is in the big cold world , in which most people have hearts of stone . " <P> Biographer Rhodes James ' nomination of the Prince Consort as " perhaps the most astute and ambitious politician of his age " seems one compliment too far ; Metternich was still active in the decade when Albert married Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year after Albert died . This Albert memorial serves mainly to persuade readers that , compared with most European royalty , the Prince was a giant . Alas , a giant among royalty is only man-size anywhere else .
