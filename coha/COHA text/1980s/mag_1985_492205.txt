Australia : City Side . by Ted Kreiter has kept its trolleys . The " old rattlers " add a turn-of-the-century flavor that Melbourners like . They take their history seriously . Where possible , they fit new high-rise buildings behind old Victorian facades . The restoration of Victorian homes is a civic passion . Melbourne 's skyline is a blend of traditional and modern . Its tallest buildings , at present , are the Collins Place twin towers , 50-story structures that house offices and a unique hotel : The Regent Melbourne starts out like any other hotel with a lobby on the 35th-floor mezzanine , but the first rooms are on floor 36 . Offices occupy the floors in between , and the gap is spanned by high-speed elevators , This tower-top hotel is always filled on weekends , said one employee , not by the usual clientele of tourists and businessmen , but by Melbourne citizens who come to enjoy the view . From the vantage here , one can see far out into Port Phillip Bay and trace the sweep of the Yarra River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters are worked continuously by scullers and water-skiers ; horsemen , cyclists and joggers use the trails along its banks . Australia 's latest fitness celebrity has recently set up shop at the Regent . The lite-lunch crowd comes to Julie Stafford 's Taste of Life restaurant to munch such delectables as beet root , orange and chicken sandwiches and to wash them down with a brew of chicory , barley and toasted rye  --  not everybody 's cup of tea , perhaps , but Julie 's cooking , which she believes helped her husband recover from terminal cancer , is winning converts throughout Australia . Across the Yarra , near the Princes Bridge , stands Melbourne 's reply to Sydney 's flashy opera house  --  the Victorian Arts Centre spire . " So what ? " may be your first response . The spire looks like a glorified radio antenna . But a tour of the plush , state-of-the-art theaters beneath and the adjacent National Gallery of Victoria and Melbourne Concert Hall turns indifference to enthusiasm . This arts complex rivals any in the world . The Sydney-siders might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints about their more conservative rival to the south . Melbourne 's weather is too changeable , they say , and its night life ? They just roll their eyes . " Put it this way , " said a Sydney cabdriver . " Melbourne 's a good place to visit on a weekday . " Yet Melbourne does offer one evening activity that no other city equals ? the Penguin Parade . Every night at dusk , residents head out to Phillip Island , 60 miles from town . One enterprising flying service even lifts groups over at $100 a person , champagne included . In all , thousands arrive nightly to watch the island 's flocks of fairy penguins clock out from a hard day 's fishing and waddle up the wide beach to feed their young on shore . People are instructed not to take flash photos , but the penguins pay little heed to the fawning crowds ; they are much more worried about local birds that swoop down and try to make them lose their suppers . Recently , the penguins ' food supply ran short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus avert a national catastrophe Escalante became Utah 's first white 94 the loss of one of Australia 's best tourist attractions . Melbourne 's first and most successful attraction was gold . In 1857 , city businessmen offered rewards to anyone who could find the yellow stuff in their neighborhood . It was discovered that very year at Ballarat , about 70 miles west. ? the richest alluvial gold deposit in the world . There , an old mining town called Sovereign Hill has been carefully restored , complete with mine shafts and a stream thoughtfully seeded with gold dust for the amateur prospectors . Some visitors come away with more than valueless flecks . " Just the other day a little girl from Melbourne found a gold nugget lying on the ground , right here in town , " said a Sovereign Hill employee , " a small one , of course . " In recent years a man prospecting in surrounding hills found a somewhat larger nugget , which he sold to a Las Vegas casino for $1 million . In a land where good-natured quirkiness is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractions . One of them is Phar Lap , Australia 's most famous race horse . The 17-hand-high chestnut gelding large glass case at Melbourne 's National Museum . His heart , the largest horse heart on record , is preserved at the Institute of Anatomy in Canberra . " A magnificent animal , " exclaimed one proud Australian viewer . " And what a job of taxidermy . " Phar Lap still holds Melbourne 's heartstrings . When his trainer , Tommy Woodcock , died last spring , the old horseman was given the largest funeral in Melbourne 's history . Melbourne 's other shrines , in descending order of reverence , are the Old Melbourne Gaol , where the notorious bushranger ( outlaw ) Ned Kelly was hanged in 1880 , and the oil painting of " Chloe " at Young and Jackson 's Pub . The nude Chloe has survived 100 years of admiring , if unrepeatable , toasts . Sydney These tidbits of Australiana are as nothing compared to the concentrated stuff that awaits tourists at the Argyle Tavern in Sydney . This nightspot is located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement . The band , armed with good voices but awful jokes , evokes every gaudy ghost of Australia 's past . Anyone who likes to dine while watching a live sheep sheared to music , or listening to a rumbling recitative on a didjeridoo , a hollowed-out log that aborigines call a musical instrument  --  this is the place for you . People who survive may wish to pursue other Sydney night life . For a heightened sense of danger , a stroll through Sydney 's " clean sleaze " district of Kings Cross will do . The best strategy here is to walk quickly past the girlie bars and tattoo parlors with eyes focused straight ahead . Those with a different concept of fun may take a wild 60-mph taxi ride along Sydney 's snaking freeways out to Doyles on the Beach at Watson 's Bay to enjoy  --  after recovering their equilibrium  --  a delicious seaside supper in the open air . The forecast is printed right on the menu : " Today 's weather : fine . " Haute cuisine buffs may prefer to stay downtown at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguise . Seafood is ground up and presented as bockwurst , Duck Supreme on Quince Compote looks a lot like roast lamb and the bill for a large group could pass for a second mortgage . The food is delicious . Sydney is almost as lively by day as by night . Each morning workers arrive by hydrofoil from far sections of the harbor at the Circular Quay  --  it 's easier to come across the water than to tackle the traffic jams on the freeways . At lunchtime , people hit the streets again , having traded their suits for jogging shorts . Tourists can take the 20-minute hydrofoil lift to Manly as the first leg of a multibeach sightseeing tour of Sydney 's north coast . If one beautiful beach does n't suit their fancy , there 'll be another up the road . Along the way they 'll pass Long Reef Golf Club , perhaps the most dangerous course in the country . " There 's copper in the soil that attracts lightning , " said the bus driver , " and there 's plenty of stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands . " Also on this end of the city is Waratah Park , where one can shake hands with kangaroos , glimpse a Tasmanian devil , be soundly pecked by an Australian emu and even pet a koala . Park attendants do n't allow visitors to hold the sleepy creatures , which may become frightened and scratch . Just north of Sydney , surrounded by five national parks , the broad Hawkesbury River flows in a grand finale into Broken Bay . The Hawkesbury , once populated by aborigines who lived in the limestone caves along its banks , is now a favorite playground of city dwellers who relax in its quiet coves . Amphibious planes stand ready at Broken Bay 's Palm Beach to taxi visitors back home . But Sydney 's most popular attraction is its own front yard , the combined handiwork of God , British convicts and Australian workingmen . To one side stands the mighty Sydney Harbour Bridge , alias " the iron lung . " To the other is the unsinkable Sydney Opera House , built at an 850 percent cost overrun for $102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen , but perhaps the most memorable comment came , long before the bridge and the opera house were built , from a convict condemned to hang on a rocky little island just off the coast . Asked for his last words , he simply looked around and exclaimed , " Lovely harbor ye 've got here , " It 's the kind of story Sydneysiders like . Wounds continued from page 67 mitted Christian physicians who are in private practice and willing to pay their own expenses , we are helping to reverse this trend . How we provide relief is as important as what we do . Integrity is essential . When presenting a need , I never twist people 's arms or manipulate them into giving . I simply communicate what I have seen in my travels , then let God move people to contribute . When someone specifies that a donation is to be used for a particular project , we apply 100 percent of the gift to that purpose and deduct no administrative costs . People like to give when they know their funds actually reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I decide which needs we should try to meet . After all , situations in which people need help always outnumber the resources available for relief . My answer is : Although we ca n't help everybody , we can help some . In Jesus ' story about the good Samaritan , just one man was beaten and robbed ; because no one else had stopped , the Samaritan became involved . We help people , especially those overlooked by others , one at a time as we encounter them along life 's road . We are not responsible for all the people in the world  --  only for the people in our personal sphere . The question is : Are we willing to become involved ? I know of one man who , even though he had a heart condition , went to the Middle East at age 55 to build a mission hospital . While he was there the mission ran out of money , so he cabled his son back home and ordered him to sell 40 acres of the family farm . Several months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent another telegram : " Sell the farm . " This man gave of himself , and when more was needed , he sold the farm . He was willing to become involved , and so should we be . What does the future hold for my work ? My plan is to meet needs one at a time as they arise , to fulfill the unique calling God has given me through Samaritan 's Purse and World Medical Missions . Our organizations have grown much since we began , and in a hurting world , they have plenty of room to grow .
