One person has been arrested and several others are under investigation by Boston Police in connection with the theft , forgery and cashing of about $250,000 in payroll checks from the city ' s Department of Health and Hospitals . Police Deputy Supt. James Feeney said yesterday in a telephone interview that Jeffrey Cunningham , 31 , of 234 Poplar st. , Roslindale , has been arraigned on 26 charges related to the theft and cashing of 1041 checks , and that additional charges probably will be made . " We don ' t know where the money is yet , " Feeney said . Cunningham was carrying $1900 in cash when arrested , according to police . Feeney said Cunningham was arrested Tuesday at the main office of Suffolk Franklin Savings Bank at 45 Franklin st. in Boston . He said the suspect , who gave his occupation as ironworker , has never been an employee of the city " to the best of our knowledge . " He said others who have been questioned in the case also have not been city workers . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checks , and he ' s not telling anything yet , " Feeney said . A plea of innocent was entered for Cunningham at his arraignment Tuesday in West Roxbury District Court . The suspect was released on $1000 bond , Feeney said , adding that the Suffolk County district attorney ' s office has sought a $25,000 bond . Feeney said the arrest was made as a result of an investigation started by detectives Francis McDonough and Leonard Weare on the basis of a tip . In cooperation with officials of the city treasurer ' s office and the hospitals department , the detectives discovered that the checks had been stolen from boxes in the computer room at Boston City Hospital . The investigators discovered that 35 boxes , each containing 5000 checks , were delivered to the hospital last September , and that someone had taken blank checks from a box on the bottom of a stack in the computer area . " The box had been opened from the bottom . The top was secure , " Feeney said . " The only way to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and inspect it . " Feeney added that the boxes are checked a couple of times a week to make sure they were secure but that these inspections did not uncover the tampering . The Health and Hospitals Department , which has about 3000 employees and is second in size only to the School Department , takes checks from the computer room every Monday to cover its payroll , and sends them to the city treasurer to be filled out and endorsed . Asked how the stolen checks had been endorsed , Feeney would only say : " They are very good forgeries . " The police official said that the forgers started out cashing checks made out for $50 to $100 at a time , and built up to larger amounts . " I ' ve seen a couple over $500 , " Feeney said . He said Cunningham had been cashing checks in his own name , and thus had no problems when asked for identification . Officials do not know precisely how many of the 1041 checks that were stolen have been cashed , because the forgeries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the city weekly . B07916906
