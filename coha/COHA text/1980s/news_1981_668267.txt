Federal Communication Comr . Anne P. Jones , one of four FCC members who voted last year to strip RKO General of licenses for WNAC-TV ( Channel 7 ) and two other TV stations , said one of the reasons she opted for lifting the licenses was because the commission found that " RKO General lacks the character required to be a commission licensee . " While Jones said that she would have voted against RKO for other infractions , she also believes the term " character , " should cease to be a criterion for FCC concerns " and the word should be deleted from the Communications Act . " The Arlington lawyer and federal executive , who spoke yesterday before the New England Broadcasting Assn. , called on NEBA members to " write to your Congressmen , write to the FCC , and insist that the word character ' is irrelevant , and that the Communication Act be amended . " Declining to get into a detailed discussion of the Ch. 7 license case , which she noted is under appeal in the federal courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " showed a pattern of disregard for law by both RKO and its corporate affiliates . " Explaining her vote , she said the RKO General actions " seemed to me clearly inconsistent with the commission ' s existing standard of character required of broadcast licensees . That being true , I concluded that I had to join the decision to deny renewals of these licenses . " Jones said that she and Comr . Joseph Fogarty , the only two remaining active among the seven FCC members who voted on the RKO case in June 1980 - they both voted to take the licenses away - have tried for two years to get " a useful , coherent commission policy on character . The formal response to this request has , thus far , been zero , " she said , adding that the problem is a difficult one and the inaction hasn ' t surprised her . Change may be in the wind , however , she hinted , citing remarks made this past month by new FCC chairman Mark Fowler and earlier by new commission general counsel Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RKO General to reconsider the license case , a decision that Jones applauded and said she had supported informally . RKO General in June had asked for a reopening of the FCC ' s most- controversia l disciplinary case , returning it from the federal circuit court of appeals in Washington to the regulatory agency . Some see the Sharp decision as a blow to RKO , which stands to lose an estimated $ 400 million if the court upholds the vote to lift the three permits in Boston , New York and Los Angeles . " The court is where the final decision should be made . The FCC has given its best judgment on a very difficult case , a divided ( 4 to 3 ) decision . The court is the proper place to make the final determination , " she said . She told the broadcasters that any other action on the RKO request would have " political overtones , " and might suggest that a Republican Administration ' s FCC was attempting to overturn the vote of a Carter Democratic board . " All parties involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the case before the court , " she said . Veteran TV newsman Jack Chase , 64 , of Ch. 4 will undergo open- heart surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital today . Chase , who has been a Boston broadcast fixture for 28 years , was hospitalized after a heart attack in May . He re-entered the hospital a week ago for tests .
