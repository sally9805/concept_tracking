NEW YORK STORIES <P> Directed by Martin Scorsese , Francis Coppola , Woody Allen ; Screenplays <P> by Richard Price , Francis Coppola and Sofia Coppola , Woody Allen <P> Invidious comparisons being the curse of the creative class ( and the perverse joy of the critical community ) , the first thing one must say to Martin Scorsese , Francis Coppola and Woody Allen is " Brave lads ! " <P> They have each contributed a short film to New York Stories , probably , knowing as they signed their contracts that their work , when combined , would not be judged for its total effect , which is delightful , but scored like some unlikely Olympic event . One imagines reviewers grouped around the pool , holding up flash cards ( 9.5 , 7.0 or whatever ) as these men , possibly the best American directors of their generation , paddle back up to the surface after their plunge into the unfamiliar depths of the anthology film . <P> The dive into the short-movie form is highly difficult , especially when confronted from the platform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort and narrative skills needed for a full-length feature but , without the distractions of spectacle or subplot , makes flaws more obvious . In these circumstances , Scorsese and Allen have a natural advantage . Their core following is not big enough to support the grand movie gesture , and they have learned the art of compression that seems to bore , if not actually depress , their ever thrashing colleague . <P> Scorsese is hardly a highly verbal filmmaker . His gift is to pack the equivalent of a thousand words of dialogue into a single elegant image . Life Lessons is about a bearish artist ( Nick Nolte ) whose reputation is currently bullish in chic circles but is distinctly on the decline as far as his lover assistant ( Rosanna Arquette ) is concerned . Both actors are excellent , as is Richard Price 's script , which is taken from a passage in Dostoyevsky 's life . But it is from the observation of simple things  --  a slo-mo close-up of a cigarette being discarded , a brush slathering gobs of paint on a canvas  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation and emotional destruction that Scorsese sidles slyly up to the highest truths of his tale . <P> Allen 's method is different . In Oedipus Wrecks , his efficiency is that of the perfectly practiced anecdotalist , not wasting a moment on irrelevant detail , yet knowing when to linger over the important ones . In this brisk vignette , Allen himself plays Sheldon , victim of a kind of transcendental Jewish-mother joke . It would spoil the fun to say how he transforms a stock figure , a yammering , smothering mom ( Mae Questel , who is splendid ) , from a private torment into a public menace , but it is literally magical to behold .
