A diplomatic gambit enlivens the lethargic Democratic race <P> Democratic Front Runner Walter Mondale had expected to open the 1984 election year with a media blitz . He would attack Ronald Reagan 's " ad-lib foreign policy " and outline his own supposedly more cohesive alternatives in a hard-hitting speech to the National Press Club in Washington , B.C. Then , in a DC-9 loaded with reporters , he would aggressively tour the South , where he hopes to wrap up his party 's presidential nomination by mid-March . But when he stepped to the microphone in Washington , Mondale joined a media blitz for another candidate . " All of us are proud of the Rev. Jackson 's success , " Mondale began . " He deserves our thanks on this happy day for Lieut . Goodman , his family and our country . " <P> Jesse Jackson 's dramatic rescue mission in Syria was a political coup that the seven other Democratic candidates could only envy and praise . For most of a week , the black minister 's exploits topped the evening news and produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attracted more publicity , conceded Sergio Bendixen , Alan Cranston 's campaign manager . Maxine Isaacs , Mondale 's press secretary , said of the former Vice President 's staff , " If we were younger and less experienced , we 'd be depressed . " With one stroke , Jackson , by successfully gaining the release of Navy Flyer Robert Goodman , gave his campaign a credibility that it had sorely lacked . Said Andrew Young , Atlanta 's black mayor : " When Jesse says something visionary now , people wo n't take it as ridiculous . " <P> But will Jackson 's publicity bonanza produce enough votes to shake up the Democratic race seriously ? Many political experts had doubts . " Jesse can get every political prisoner released in the world , and he ca n't be nominated , " contended Joe Reed , chairman of the all-black Alabama Democratic Conference , which has endorsed Mondale for President and Jackson for Vice President . Jackson , naturally , took a more upbeat view . " God will provide , " he said . " Who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Portsmouth , N.H. , being held in a jail in Damascus ? " His plans to hold a political rally with Goodman in Portsmouth on Saturday were nixed by the Navy , which said its regulations forbid political appearances by servicemen . <P> <P> Most analysts saw Jackson gaining as a potential spoiler in the race , possibly slowing Mondale 's drive toward an early lock on the nomination . To do so , Jackson would have to show unexpectedly well on " Super Tuesday , " March 13 , when primaries will be held in Alabama , Georgia , Florida and three other states . " His next move is critical , " said Georgia Democratic Chairman Bert Lance . " He still has the basic problems of money and organization . "
