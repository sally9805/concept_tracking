At 7:30 on a muggy Houston morning , George Foreman , the heavyweight boxing champion of 15 years ago , is bundled in a military shirt and heavy work pants , plodding up and down a freeway embankment in the piney woods near his home . Foreman is n't just climbing the steep hill . He is maneuvering up it backward  --  up and back , up and back  --  a modern-day Sisyphus , sweating and straining in the heavy grass . As he moves , the old fighter hurls jabs and uppercuts at the blazing sun with his prodigious arms . <P> Strange as the sight might seem , Foreman 's goal is even odder . At the age of 40 , after a full ten years layoff from the ring and about 40 lbs . over his best fighting weight , the slugger is in training once again . His objective  --  some call it an obsession  --  is to recapture the heavyweight title he lost by a knockout to Muhammad Ali in 1974 . Exclaims the ex-champ : " I 'm ready , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreman be serious ? What kind of odds would Vegas put on him against Iron Mike Tyson , the current titleholder ? Boxing does not take kindly to reruns by its geriatric set . Witness Joe Louis , Joe Frazier , Larry Holmes and Ali . Foreman , the boxer turned preacher , is older than the other ex-champs who tried in vain to return . Some of them embarrassed themselves . Some of them got flattened . Boxing experts snicker that there are only two kinds of opponents Foreman can be counted on to defeat . One kind is hooked up to a respirator . The other can be found lying on a sesame-seed bun in the company of pickles and catsup . <P> None of this bothers Foreman , who KO 'd 42 opponents in compiling a 45-2 record . He is all vigor and determination these summer days , slugging at the bags and straining on the iron . This is a new Foreman , he is quick to advise : " Forty is no death sentence ; age is only a problem if you make it one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in 1973 when he blockbusted Joe Frazier clear off the canvas to win the title . His 19-in. biceps bulge with muscle , his thighs are thick as saplings , his huge 48-in. chest heaves with power . He also has the beginnings of a paunch . Explains Foreman : " The secret to my winning is my eating . " By which he means that he has been reborn at the dinner table too . The Big Macs have been replaced by broiled mackerel . For breakfast , the slugger still puts away a dozen eggs , but first he excises the yolks . <P> In 18 fights since he launched his comeback two years ago , Foreman has knocked out every foe , leading him to crow , " I 've proved myself . I deserve a chance at Tyson . He ca n't say he 's the best as long as a 40-year-old man not from Mars is sitting out here . He ca n't whup me . " Foreman rambles on , branding Tyson a " sneaky crybaby " and insisting , " My biggest job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thought springs to mind : Is the old slugger punch- drunk ? This , after all , is the same George Foreman who found religion in a San Juan , Puerto Rico , dressing room in 1977 , proclaimed boxing an affront to God and announced he was quitting forever . This is the same Foreman who ballooned to 320 lbs . from a fighting trim of 217 , and even today at 255 is far beefier than anyone who wants to hold the title should be . As for the recent wins , all were against unknowns or retreads who will probably never get within spitting distance of the Top Ten contenders .
