" I know there is n't any one reason for anything , " he said , " but I wondered if you had any ideas . " " What does Mary say ? " He thought : She thinks of you as Lost in the Forest , but obviouslyyou are not . " Actually , " he said , " we were talking this past weekend , and I tried to get her to talk about one of the books you were having them read . Vanity Fair . I must say she did n't seem eager to talk about it . I do n't think kids are comfortable talking about books when they 're her age . I know I was n't . But that is n't what I started to say . " She was looking at him . She looked tired . She was quite pretty , and he wondered what she was really thinking . Whatever she had been thinking earlier had been erased . He looked at the swirls and streaks of white on the blackboard behind her . " What were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looking back at her . " Sorry . I was going to say that she acted as if Vanity Fair was silly . I asked her how she felt about Dobbin and she seemed to think he was ludicrous . But later she said a very perceptive thing . We were talking about something else entirely , and she said , in passing , that Vanity Fair seemed to be about how things just fall into place . " He realized that he was leaning quite far forward . He eased himself farther back on the desk . Looked at her , trying not to appearanxious . He was anxious . He was not sure about what . About what Mary had said , in part . He was wondering if that was true . Maybe things just fell quickly because of gravity , and when they stopped , you said they were in place . That thought disturbed him so much that he stood up . " You 've read Vanity Fair , " she said . He nodded yes . He did not tell her that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to have lunch , " he said . " Have you already eaten ?

" I 'll go to lunch with somebody who 's read Thackeray . Sure , " she said . " Just a minute . " And then he was alone in the room . It seemed strange to bep101there alone  --  almost as if something dangerous might happen . He wondered what might happen , and smiled at the image that flashed through his head of himself , backing up toward the dusty blackboard as though a magnet were drawing him , getting his clothes dirty . He would have to wear this same jacket and this same pair of pants into the city . Everybody he knew had problems with their children . They all had children who needed braces , or were doing poorly in school , or had run away . Last week , Metcalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Metcalf had brought them into New York to get new lenses made up . That morning he kept calling people into his office to see the glasses . He had put them on the corner of his desk , on a stand with a curved piece of brass that usually held a strange shell . A small pair of glasses , both lenses cracked , tiny cracks like the points of fire shooting away from a sparkler : a small pair of horn-rimmed glasses , useless to see out of , set out for people to look at like an objet d'art . " Eight years old , and blind as a bat without them . On my lunch hour I 'm taking them to a place that can grind new lenses and put them in by five o'clock , and then I 'm driving out to Sneden 's Landing with them and giving them to Paul , and he 'll put them on and see again . He 's a nice kid , and he 'll probably even thank me . He was upset about breaking them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bat . I 'm the big-shot today . I give him his sight back for forty smackers . Costs that much only because the frames got screwed up , too . But he 's blind . Eight years old , and my kid is blind . When I was eight years old , I was blind , too . My wife has 20 -- 15 , my kid and I are blind . " Coming out of Metcalf 's office , Nick had turned to him and said , " I almost did it that time . I really almost walked over to him and smashed him . He tosses off everything as a joke , constantly . If he came back from the dead , you know what he 'd do ? Deface his own gravestone . " It had seemed irrelevant to tell Nick that years before , when he first came to work for the agency , he had gone out with Metcalf one Friday after work and they had gotten drunk , and Metcalf had gotten maudlin and talked about how he was going to he cremated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had liked Korea . Not the war part , but Korea . He had liked Korea.  | " Okay , " Cynthia said , coming back into the room . She had combed her hair and did not look quite as tired . He suggested a restaurant a few miles down the road from the school , and she said she 'd follow him in her car . At lunch , he was going to have to think of something to say to her , to find some way to get her to pass Mary . He would certainly never think of anything to say to Mary to persuade her that she should try harder . If he were Nick , he could dazzle Cynthia with all the knots he could tie . He smiled . Nick had sworn to him that that really dazzled women . That they would do anything for a man who could tie fifteen different knots . All right : That was the truth of it . He found her attractive . She had Nina 's direct gaze , and she obviously deserved better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Nina deserved better than Lord and Taylor 's , and when he felt sorry for women a feeling of longing often got mixed up with the pity . He turned on the radio , kept moving the dial . " And this one , you can be sure , is one of the best , " the announcer 's voice said . " This is a recording of Do n't Worry ' Bout Me ' which was used as the theme song for a movie I 'll bet a lot of you have forgotten called End of the Road . Billie Holiday recorded this one in 1957 , with the Ray Ellis Orchestra , and the man you 'll hear on alto sax is Mr. Gene Quill . " The announcer had a surprisingly calm , quiet voice  --  a late-night announcer 's voice . Billie Holiday was singing . She was singing , and the lyrics , of course , were not to be understood as meaning what they were saying . When she sang " I 'll get along " it was painful ; the restraint in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not selfpityingeither . Nina could do that : She could say something about her ability to survive that would shock him with her lack of faith in herself , but she would n't give in . She really pretended to be a survivor , to the extent that at times he feared for her life , actually thought she might be dead when the telephone rang in her apartment and she did n't answer . Nina hated him to talk that way . She said that he had been a Boy Scout too long , that she did not care to be helped across the street . But once , early on , surprised at the intensity of her feeling for him , she had gotten drunk at dinner . He had held her arm crossing the street , and she had not objected . She wanted to marry him . Nina . He pulled into the parking lot outside the restaurant . Cynthiap103passed his car and parked farther down , on the opposite side . His parking place was closer : He should have left it for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina was right about his being too much of a Boy Scout . If they had taught him to tie knots in the Boy Scouts , he did n't remember it . The restaurant was air conditioned , and the instant he felt cool he wanted a drink . He asked her if she wanted a drink , hoping that she did . When the waiter came , she ordered a glass of white wine , and he ordered a gin and tonic . " I was thinking , driving here , that I do n't envy you , " he said . She smiled . She seemed to know what he meant , and he was glad , because after he said it , he realized that it might have seemed a condescending thing to have said . " I was wondering why you were n't at work , " she said . " I had to have a conference today with my daughter 's English teacher . " " Well , " Cynthia said , " I 'm glad you took the English teacher to lunch . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom . " " You write on the blackboard , " he said . " Yes , " she said . " Quite a few teachers , I think ... " " I just meant that I forgot that information gets communicated that way . I 'm used to memos . I guess you could n't very well send the students memos about Thackeray and have them initial them and send them back . " " What ? " She laughed . She picked up her glass of wine and had a drink the minute the waiter put it on the table . " Footing the bill , too ? " she said . " The English teacher is almostbroke . " " Sure , " he said . " Of course . " " This is odd , " she said . " This is n't what I thought I 'd be doing today . " " I was hungry , " he said . " I was embarrassed , thinking you could hear my stomach growl . " " I did n't . " " You did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted six cheeseburgers . If he only had one drink , he would order a turkeysandwich . If he had two , he would order a cheeseburger . " In answer to your question , " she said , " I know that yourp104daughter can read the books and understand them , and that she can write about what she knows , if she wants to . I do not have that feeling about everyone in the class . I do have the feeling that she does n't care , that it is n't cool to care , and that neither you nor I can probably make her care . " " I like what you said about there not being one answer for things , " he said . " What do you mean ? " " You said , when I asked why she was doing poorly , that there was n't any one answer . " " I know , " she said . " I mean , what do you think the answers are ? " " I agree with you , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cool to care . " " And what else ? " she said . " She thinks Thackeray is irrelevant . It 's summer  --  " " I do n't know if it 's important whether it 's irrelevant or not . I mean , I do n't think it is irrelevant , but those are n't even terms I think in . " She took a drink . He took a drink . He was afraid that if he asked her what she did think , she might tell him , and it might surprise him . It was too early in the conversation to ask what she was thinking . " When I feel like giving up  --  not showing up to teach  --  when I 'm in a bad mood , I see it their way . I see the absurdity of thinking about any time but our own . I can see wanting books to hit me over the head and tell me what to do about my problems . I do n't want to know what the Odyssey has to do , indirectly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Ann Landers is predictable . You have to distrust those answers because of that . " " Is she ? " Cynthia said . " I do n't read Ann Landers . " She had almost finished her wine . It was a small glass . He got the waiter 's attention and ordered another glass of wine , and before he was tempted , another drink and a turkey sandwich to he brought at the same time . She ordered a salad . " Why fight it , I guess , " Cynthia said . " It was predictable that I 'd order a salad and you would n't . " Shc fiddled with her napkin.  | " You can get caught up in that  --  thinking that because you can make everything seem ironic , that things genuinely are . You can put an ironic front on anything . I felt sort of the way they must feel  --  the way I think they must feel  --  when I was younger than they are . In grade school , when we used to go down to the cafeteria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads  --  what we were supposed to do if the bomb dropped , if the bell went off for real and a bomb dropped . Then we 'd file upstairs and hear about Washington crossing the Delaware . But everybody 's had that experience , or a comparable experience . Constantly . I 'm not so sure that these times are as mind-blowing as those kids pretend . I 'm not sure that they are n't just lazy , and that it is n't easy to be lazy . " While she talked , he looked at her hands . They were small hands , thin , with long fingers  --  a young woman 's hands . How was it possible that Louise 's hands were so much larger ? How could hands get bigger as you got older ? She was staring at the tabletop . " What are you thinking ? " he said . " Oh , " she said , shaking her head in apology . She shook her head again . " I was thinking about a friend of mine who has nightmares about the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding , and he 's not supposed to look at the fireball . " She took another drink . " This is an odd conversation to be having . Did I start this odd conversation ? " " I do n't remember . " " Did we somehow get to Spangle and the fireball by way of your daughter 's problems in summer school ? " " Spangle ? " " That 's his name . He 's in Madrid , trying to talk his brother into coming back to the States to reenroll in law school . Ann Landers would say he 's doing the right thing , right ? " " I imagine , " he said . He was tapping the salt and pepper shakers together . " I 'm glad you wanted to come to lunch , " he said . That seemed to be the wrong thing to say . For some reason , that seemed to embarrass her , while other things had n't . She sat up a little straighter and did n't say anything . He looked at some of the other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York at one o'clock . The middle-aged women leaned forward or sat close together like conspirators , and the fewp106younger women in the restaurant seemed formal , stiffer , almost alienated from each other . He saw only two other pretty women , neither one as pretty as Cynthia . And he suddenly remembered part of the reason he had dreaded meeting her : that notice she had sent around , with a picture of herself on the top , like an egomaniac 's stationery . Perhaps she had done it as an ironic frame . " On the off chance that I get drunk , " he said , " tell me what ideas you have , if any , about how Mary could pass the course . " " Tell her to come see me . I asked her to twice , and she did n't . If she and I could work it out privately  --  if nobody else has to know that she cares about passing the course but Mary and me  --  maybe she 'll be more willing to try . We can hush it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He moved his hands above the tabletop , crossing one over the other . " Now you do n't see them , " he said , when his hands were over the salt and pepper shakers . " Now you do . " He moved his hands again . " You do n't care , and then you do . " She was staring at him , with her mouth open . " What ? " he said , smiling nervously . " What you just did , " she said . " What a coincidence . I was thinking about a magician , and that was such a strange thing to have happened . " She picked up her wine glass and put it down . " There 's a man in New Haven , where I 'm living , who turned up last night . I met him a little while ago , at a laundromat , and last night when I was going out I bumped into him again , except that I had the spooky feeling that I did n't really bump into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on purpose . " She picked up the glass again and took a drink of wine . " Never mind , " she said . " I 'm sorry . I did n't get much sleep last night because the damned fan does n't work . " " No , " he said . " Go on . " " Oh , he 's just a harmless eccentric , I 'm sure , but it was so strange seeing him again , and he wanted to have the exact conversationwe 'd had before , in the laundromat . That did n't make sense , because it was obvious that he recognized me . He stopped and said hello , and I said hello to him , and he turned and started walking in my direction , and he started to tell me all over again how he was visiting his mother in New Haven , that he lived inp107California . I was sure he had the same things to do tricks with in his pocket . " She shook her head . " This is silly , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Nothing , really . He just acted like we were old friends , or something . When I told him I was in a hurry , he just kept pace with me . So I got in a cab and got away . But it was strange , having him walk toward me on the street , and acting so casual , but when I was looking for a cab he seemed almost desperate to tell me things about some Houdini conference that was held every year , and to tell me what was behind Houdini 's trick of breaking out of chains when he was under water . I was really getting frightened . I just  --  I thought he was going to do something to me . " " Christ , " he said . " I do n't think that 's nothing . I think you ought to stop going out alone . " " New Haven 's full of nuts . It does n't mean anything . " " Really , " he said . " The way you describe it , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fork over the top of her salad . She stopped , and ate some lettuce . He wanted to say more , but he did n't want to scare her , and it was obvious that she wanted to change the subject . He picked up his sandwich and bit into it . " You drive in all the way from New Haven ? " he said . She nodded yes . " But you do n't like living in New Haven . " " It 's close to Yale . " " Do you live there alone ? " he said . " No . I live there with a man . The one who has the nightmares . " She laughed . " One of my students ' parents comes to see me and I say I 'm living with a man who 's scared of looking at a fireball . " " My heart can take it , " he said . " My sense of morality is not outraged . " He took another drink . " People should live together before they get married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course , " he said . " Of course not in the world of Vanity Fair . " When they had finished eating , the waiter came and asked if they wanted anything else . he went away to add up the check.  |p108When  he came back , he put the small tray with the piece of paper on it by Cynthia . " He guessed wrong , " Cynthia said . He reached for the check , took money out of his wallet . " Do you need money ? " he said . He realized that even asking would be embarrassing , but if she did , maybe she would take it . Then maybe they would have another lunch sometime and she would pay him back . " No , " she said , embarrassed . " I hope it did n't sound like I was hinting for money . " " Oh no , " he said . " I just thought you might need some money . " They were both a little embarrassed , and he was embarrassed , too , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He almost always found it awkward to shake hands with a young woman . He also felt strange because her hand was so much like Nina 's , and he felt strange because there was a Nina , and strange that he had almosttold Cynthia about her , but he had stopped short and only said that people should live together . He drove into New York at sixty-five , sixty-eight , needle edging onto seventy at times , almost hoping that he would be stopped . He wanted to think , but he did n't have time to stop and think . He was late for work.  |p109He  took a paper cup out of the dispenser by the water cooler and thought of two things : the robin 's egg ( just as the cup seemed too fragile to hold water , the egg seemed too thin to have containedanything living ) and the napkin , folded into a triangle in the Chinese restaurant , Louise carefully refolding it , putting it into the glass , walking out . He had another throbbing headache and he would have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The headache had come on him like a mosquito bite rising . His temple had suddenly been filled with pain when he opened his car door in the parking garage . He had gotten out , turned when the man gave him the receipt , and leaned back , touching the car , standing there with his hands curled into fists on top of the roof , supporting his head on them . The young black man working in the garage had hit him on the shoulder . " Do n't you grieve for it now , " he said . " Seven dollars and ninety cents , you can have it back any time . " The man had laughed at his own joke . Do n't you grieve for it . Certainly everything was not loaded with meaning . Why was he getting stopped by things so often ?  |p110That  things just fall into place . Because he would n't be able to rest until the situation with Nina was settled . He stood at the water cooler . Two aspirin were n't going to help . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what to say . He took the aspirin and went anyway . " What 's the matter ? " Nick said when he saw him . " I had lunch with her teacher . Mary 's summer-school teacher . I held her hand  --  I mean , I shook her hand  --  and with my eyes closed , it could have been Nina 's hand . I stood there shaking the hand of Mary 's summer-school teacher , and I wanted to go to bed with her . " " So ? " Nick said . Nick put down the piece of paper he had been studying . It was a graph : stalagmites and stalactites on an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper . " Why do you look so awful ? " he said . " I 've got a headache . And you know what I think about that ? You know the old I'm-too-tired , I've-got-a-headache routine ? " Nick opened his top drawer . " If you know so much , Freud , how come you 've got cancer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is all some midlife crisis ? If I 'm just becoming aware I 'm losing my youth , and  --  " " You were running down how old you were when I came to work here three years ago . Three years ago . You were thirty-seven . " " You 're only thirty-five now . You want to disbelieve Passages ? " " You 're drunk ? " " I 'm not drunk . My head is pounding . " " You 're talking to me about Passages . Passages . I want to not believe Passages . Correct . You 're in a midlife crisis : correct or incorrect . Okay . This is the stupidest conversation I 've had all day , and that includes nearly an hour-long conference with Metcalf this morning . This teacher was pretty ? " He sat in the chair across from Nick 's desk . Behind Nick was a Betty Boop clock . Out of her surprised mouth came two black arrows telling the time . Five of three . " I love it , " Nick said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what the fuck the reason is . You must have gotten along very well with that schoolteacher today . " John tapped Nick 's paperweight ( a picture of Mary Pick f ord 's house , Pickf air , under glass ) against the edge of his desk.  | " My head is killing me , " he said . He put down the paperweight . " Thirty-five , " he said . " Did you ever read L'etranger in college ? " " The Stranger , by Albert Camus . I read it , " Nick said . " You can speak English here . You 're among friends . "  |p112PARKER  LIKED to eat as much as John Joel did , but he never had any money , and John Joel got tired of lending him money he knew he 'd never see again . He could n't very well eat in front of Parker , though , so he ended up buying Parker 's lunch when they were in the city and not stopping for as many snacks as he would ordinarily . Parker hated the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assortment of Western bandannas . Todayit was a wadded-up yellow bandanna to go with the yellow shirt he wore . He let the shirttail hang out of his slacks so that he could lift it every now and then and fan up some breeze . Parker liked to wear cotton shirts instead of T-shirts , and he thought jeans were too hot in the summer . John Joel felt vaguely as if he were with his father . Nobody else his age dressed like Parker . On Fridays Parker took the train into New York to see his shrink on West Fourth Street . Lately John Joel had been taking the train into town with him . There were no hamburgers in Connecticut to compare with New York burgers . They were on Madison Avenue , where they had gone to pick up a photograph of some relative that Parker 's mother had dropped off to have restored . The mail in t he store had carefullyp113lifted the tape that sealed the brown package , separated the two pieces of cardboard inside , and revealed to them the enlargement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with buck teeth and a grayblueflower in her hair  --  some relative that Parker did n't know . The original , the man said , was in the envelope . The envelope was taped to one of the pieces of cardboard . The man smiled over the counter at them . " Is there a family resemblance ? " he said , cocking his head at Parker . " She 's ugly and I 'm fat , " Parker said , fanning his shirt away from his stomach . " What do I owe you ? " Parker 's mother had given him a blank check , and he filled in the amount . Earlier in the day he had filled in a check at the railroad station , and then again at the shrink 's . All the cash he had was eight dollars , and since the bus was too hot , that would all go to splittingthe cab fare to and from Grand Central . " She looks like a spitz , " Parker said , the package under his arm . " A what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A thin black woman with her hair in a bun passed them , pushinga white baby in a stroller . Parker showed her his stomach to shock her , but she did n't shock . She just kept walking , looking at the wheels of the stroller . " So when do you get your braces ? " Parker said . " Next week . I do n't know . " " Then you 're going to have to brush your teeth all the time , " Parker said . " Every time you eat . Otherwise that stuff will get in your braces and putrefy . " " I do n't care , " John Joel said . " Putrefy is a good word , " Parker said . " Can we get something to eat ? " " I 'm supposed to buy , right ? " John Joel said . " Right ? " " Where do you get all your money ? " Parker said . " Mostly from my grandmother . She did n't use to give us money , but she feels bad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's a baby . She gives Mary and me money . Not all the time , but maybe every other week or so . She gives Mary more than she gives me . " So why does the kid live with her ? " Parker said . John Joel shrugged . " Where do you want to cat ? That place ? " " I get sick of hamburgers . "  | " That 's what I want , though . So that 's what I 'm going to buy you . What did you want ? " " 1clairs . " " We can get some eclairs . Let 's get a hamburger . " " Where can we get eclairs ? " " We can even get them at Grand Central . Let 's get a ham-burger . " " Okay , " Parker said . They went inside . A fan was aimed at the counter , and square glass ashtrays were on top of the napkins so they would n't blow away . There was a sign asking people not to smoke . Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack in his shirt pocket . He smoked Salems . He played with the edge of his napkin , waiting for the man behind the counter to take their orders . He took out a cigarette again and tapped it on the counter but did n't light it . " You ought to see the stuff across the street , down at the WhitneyMuseum , " John Joel said . " I was in there with a friend of my father 's last week . All these plaster people sitting around on subwaycars or sprawled in bed . Some of them are naked . Some of them are painted colors . " " Let 's go there , " Parker said . " I was just there . " " So ? It 's right down the street . " " It costs money .

There was a sign on the wall that advertised milk as cow juice . " What song 's going through your head ? " the counterman said . He turned and began filling a glass with ice . " ' Stayin ' Alive , ' " Parker said . " You see Saturday Night Fever ? " " That show where they do the gag routines , " the counterman said . " Sure I 've seen it . " " Uh-uh , " Parker said .

I go to see actresses . " " There were girls in it . " Parker tore out a match . " What I read , " the counterman said , " it was about John Tra-volta . " " Hey , " the other counterman said , turning away from the grill and wiping his forehead on his arm . " You going discoing this weekend , Sal ? That what you 're talking about ?

Sal loves to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sal said . " I like to work . I like heat . That 's it . I thought this was where I 'd end up . Sure . What started this , anyway ? " Sal said . " Are you cooking today or not ? " " What does it look like I 'm doing ? Discoing ? " Robby turned back to the grill . Sal wiped his hands on a towel under the counter.  | " Maybe there 's something better to do than go across the street , " Parker said . " It was your idea . I do n't even want to go . " " Let 's go , " Parker said . " It 's right across the street , I guess . " He squirted a blob of ketchup on the side of the plate . The plate was shiny with grease . He ran the French fry through the grease and salt to the ketchup , pushed it around , and picked it up in his fingers . " My one grandmother does n't send me money because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that 's alive sends me stuff , but not money . " " When did she die ? " " Last summer . Swimming in the Adirondacks . She had a stroke or something . " " I never thought about a grandmother swimming , " John Joel said . " What 's yours do ? " " She does n't do anything . She takes my brother and the dog to the park sometimes , I think . She reads books . " " My grandmother had the Kinsey Report on her bookshelf in the kitchen with her cookbooks . It was boring . Just a lot of crap . " " What 'd she keep it there for ? " " Adults do n't think they have to hide anything , " Parker said . " No . I take it back . My father hides things . But nothing as stupid as the Kinsey Report . " " What does he hide ? " " He 's got pictures hidden . He 's got a dirty deck of cards . I opened what I thought was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Maybe it is n't even his . When my grandmother died and my grandfather went into a nursing home he hauled home all kinds of crap . I do n't even think the stuff is his , come to think of it . " " What did you think when you found it ? " " You sound like my shrink , " Parker said . " Would I have to beg for a milkshake ? " " They 're a dollar ten . " " Will it do me any good to beg for a milkshake ? " Parker had torn two matches out of the book . He pushed them toward each other , head to head . " Okay . Tell the guy we want two . "  | " Garcon , " Parker said to Sal . " Two chocolate milkshakes , please . " " I was in Paris in World War II , " Sal said . " Give me a sentence in French and I can answer you . Go ahead . " " I do n't know French . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What kind of milkshakes ? " " Chocolate , " John Joel said . " Chocolate malt , " Parker said . " My brother was in the Philippines , " the counterman said . " Used to get the monkeys drunk as skunks . Leave beer in the cans . Monkeys would swing around , loaded , fall out of the trees . Monkeyswere certifiable alcoholics . He brought one home with him , smuggled it in . Drank with him at night . Staggered around the house . There was a lost soul . My brother , I mean . There 's somebody who never figured out what he was going to do and never did it . Spent years drinking with a monkey . " " Here we go , " Robby said . " Sal : responsible hero of the family . " Sal put two metal containers under the machine and turned it on . Water ran down the sides of the containers . Parker took out hisbandanna and wiped his forehead . Robby was still standing in front of the grill with his hand over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys . Sure , " Sal said . " Their milkshakes are ready , " Robby said , pointing . Sal put two glasses on the countertop  --  the kind of glasses Coke used to be served in . He poured each glass half full and set the containers on the counter . " I never spent so much time talking to kids in ten years , " Sal said . " How did we get talking ? " " We 're fat and jolly . People ca n't resist us , " Parker said . " That 's the truth . You wo n't dare weigh too much when you 're chasing the ladies , though . Listen to me : I sound like somebody 's father . If I 'm somebody 's father , I do n't know about it . " " You 're somebody 's father , I 'll fry a leg on this griddle , " Robby said . " I 'd like to see what you do besides work . " " All this because I would n't close up shop for August . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do anything worthwhileif I closed for August . "  | " My sister 's got a condo in Ocean City . How many times do I have to tell you ? " " Yeah . And a pool that fell through the ground . A swimming pool brought down by carpenter ants . " " There 's the ocean , you know , Sal . " " Yeah . I can see it . Full of seaweed . Stay here where the fan 's going . " " I might quit , " Robby said . " You 're not going to quit , " Sal said . Parker tapped his cigarette on the counter . He knew that Sal was watching him , that he was making Sal nervous . Earlier in the day he had tapped the cigarette on his psychiatrist 's table . In front of the sofa the patients sat on , the psychiatrist had a table with magazines on it , as though the patients might tire of talking and just stop and flip through a magazine . As though they were waiting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the old Life magazines Parker thought might be collectors ' items , but he did n't want to get into that with the shrink . He would rather have spent the hour eating . He had no interest in talking to the shrink about why he was n't doing anything all summer . " Let 's get going , " John Joel said . " Let 's go to the museum and get it over with . " " Leave me a big tip , " Sal said . " He quits on me , I 'm going to need cheering up . He goes off to Atlantic City , I 'm all alone here . Just me and his grill . " " Ocean City , " Robby said . " Probably you 're going to march in the beauty parade . Leave here and put on your Easter bonnet , march in the beauty parade . " " You 're all screwed up , " Robby said . " Do n't tip him but five percent . " John Joel left a fifteen-percent tip because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at his watch and saw that they did n't have much time . Nothing was worse than being caught in New York late on Friday and having to ride the commuter train home . The few times that he had done that with his father , his father had always stood in the bar car instead of sitting down , standing and being shaken around , saying that he knew he could n't really get out , but standing gave him the illusion of escape . Whenp120the voice came over the p.a. system and began announcing where the train was headed , the message always started : " Make sure you 're right . " John Joel 's father always sighed and bent his head back when he heard that , and then shook his head as the announcementwent on : Stamford , Noroton Heights , Darien .. . On the street , they passed a man in jeans , smoking a cigar , standingand staring in a bookstore window . Parker coughed and fanned the air . They went into the Whitney without discussing it again . Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they went to the booth and John Joel bought two tickets . Then they walked into the museum and had to turn back for their stubs  --  John Joel had almost forgotten that Parker 's mother would reimburse him if she saw the stubs . He put them in his pocket , and they waited for the elevators to come . " Walk , " Parker said . " Are you kidding ? It 's too hot . " " It 's air conditioned . " " Are you kidding ? " John Joel said . Eventually the elevator came and the door opened and they got on . It was a huge elevator , like somebody 's room , without furniture . John Joel thought that there should be at least a pole light in one corner , a pillow or two on the floor . " Walk , " John Joel snorted . They got off at the third floor and started looking around . John Joel could tell that Parker was really interested in the show when he went to look at a group of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long that John Joel wandered off and read what was written about the scene Parker was looking at on the wall : Though the figures are cast from friends , by adding color to them , I touched on terror , hallucination , nightmare . He stood beside Parker and looked . The most interesting figure was the one that was all blue . By a process of elimination  --  because he was sure that that was Antony and Cleopatra sprawled on the floor , and because he could recognize Catwoman and Supermanand Pussy Galore  --  the one lie liked had to be Bottom.  | " Come on , " he finally said to Parker . " How much does he get paid for doing this ? " Parker said . " He 's a famous artist , so he 's got to be rich . I do n't know . " They looked at other pieces of sculpture : a woman on a subway car , with something rigged up so that the lights of another subway car seemed to be passing the window . A person behind a counter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got to the good stuff : a man and a woman sprawled on a brass bed , with an old mattress beneath them , the man 's penis half erect , the sheets a mess . Parker stared . He crossed the gallery and looked at the other bed scene , a blue woman sitting on the side of the bed and a man asleep . The beds both looked very uncomfortable . The lighting was odd . He stared for a while longer , then looked for John Joel . John Joel was looking at the sculpture that Nick had stared at for so long the week before . There was a girl emerging through tile  --  tile like the tile that was in their shower at home , but she was breaking through it , her left breast showing , her left leg and pubic hair , some monster of the shower , with eyes that you could n't really look into because they were looking down , just indentations , or because of the way the light was . To the side of the woman breaking through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's bodies . John Joel was thinking about Mary , and how much he would like to be able to push her from behind so that she would go through a wall like Superman , though hopefully with more pain . The woman breaking through the tile did n't look upset , though . John Joel could n't imagine why she was doing what she was doing , and thought maybe she could n't , either . " Nick says the guy who does these stands around his friends ' bedrooms and when they 're asleep , he does this . " John Joel was pointing to the figures on the bed , and Parker , beside him , was staring at them . " Creepy , " Parker said . " I bet he gets a hundred thousand for that , " John Joel said . " What does he do ? He puts plaster on his friends , like Goldfinger , or something ? " " I do n't know . Nick said he watched them . " " Who 'd go to sleep with somebody watching them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how come he knows people who 've got suchp122lousy mattresses ? They look like rafts with the air going out of them . You know the way a raft curls up before it flattens out ? " " You 're the one who wanted to come . " " Hey . You mentioned it . I did n't even know there was a show . " " You wanted to come , did n't you ? " " I did n't say the stuff was bad . I just said the guy who did it must be a weirdo . " " You want to look at other stuff ? " " Nah . What about an eclair ? " " There 's food downstairs , but I do n't think they have stuff like eclairs . " " Let 's get the train . My feet are starting to hurt . Too bad I did n't see this thing this morning . It might have given me something to talk to my shrink about . I could have said it was something I was doing this summer . The shrink always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk all day , and I should be out running around so I can report on it . " " What do you go to a shrink for , anyway ? " " Same reason you 're getting braces . My parents made me . " " What did they make you for ? " " Because they 've all gone to shrinks . Who knows . " " Maybe you 're really sick , Parker . " " Sure . Look at me . I 'm sick . I 'm hot and hungry , that 's all . " " I 've only got ten bucks left . " " Ten bucks ? I thought you had twenty . " " No . Ten . " " For the train and everything ? " " Yeah . " " We 've still got enough for eclairs , " Parker said . They took the elevator downstairs and went to the counter and got the package . " Ugly bug , " Parker said , in falsetto , when he took the package , pretending to be staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugly , ugly , ugly , " he chanted in a high squeak . They walked up to Park Avenue and got a cab . Parker sat on the jump seat and smoked a cigarette , facing John Joel . " I wonder if it 's worth anything . Some of those old pictures are . We could sell it and I 'd say I lost it . She 's always yelling about something . " " You wouldn't. "  | " Sure . What am I supposed to do , take this thing home and have to look at it ? " " You do n't know where to sell a picture . " Parker thought it over . He did n't . " I wish I had money , " Parker said . " How can I get some money ? " " What do you want it for ? " " I just want it . " " You do n't have any relatives ? " " I 've got an uncle in Maine who 's an alcoholic . He floats those little bottles of vanilla extract in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife are poor . They 're not going to give me any money . " " That 's the only relative you 've got ? " " A cousin I never see in Greenwich . " " You do n't even have other kids in your family . You 're lucky . " " If I had them , I 'd get rid of them . " " Sure . Drown them like the kittens . " " My mother stopped me . I would have drowned them . " " You would n't have . You were just waiting for her to stop you . " " Old alley cat . Was n't even ours . " " You liked them , " John Joel said . " Did I tell you about how our dog got hit by a car ? It was sort of my mother 's dog . It ran out into the street and smoosh ! It was all over the road . She talks about it all the time . My dog , my dog , my dog . ' " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . " " So why 'd you try to kill all the kittens ? " " My mother wanted me to . Then she changed her mind . " " She changed her mind because she was just joking , and you freaked her out . " " Lay off , " Parker said . " I 'm not a sissy like you . I 'll do things . You think I 'm the only person that ever thought to get rid of kittens ? " " I 'm not a sissy , " John Joel said . " Oh yeah ? You let your sister do anything she wants to you . " " Come off it . " " You do . " Parker threw the package onto the seat of the cab . " Tear it up . " " For what ? What would that prove ? "  | " That you 'd do something . Go ahead and do it . Or did you think she was pretty ? " " Yeah . She was real pretty . She was your type , Parker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yeah . Then you 'll tell your mother I ripped it up . " " I 'm not taking it home . Are you going to rip it , or am I ? " " Lexington Avenue okay ? " the cab driver said . " Okay , " John Joel said . " Go ahead , " Parker said . " Leave it in the cab if you do n't want it . I do n't want it . " " You 're afraid to do it . " " You 're afraid . So you 're trying to put it on me . " John Joel paid the cab driver . They got out and walked into Grand Central . " What 's the matter with you ? I bought you hamburgers and French fries and a milkshake , and you want an eclair out of me , and you 're not speaking to me . " " Nothing 's the matter . You just wo n't admit that you 're a coward . " " Okay . I 'm a coward . Now snap out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but you do n't believe it . " " Jesus , " John Joel sighed . " I might not have a lot of friends , but you do n't either . " " Jesus . What 's this , I 'm with a five-year-old ? " " What did you talk about the cats for ? " " They never got to be cats . Your mother gave them away . They 're gone . Big fucking deal . An alley cat . " " Tear it up . Go on , " Parker said , shoving the corner of the package against John Joel 's arm . " You 're gon na make me mad , Parker . I 'm gon na leave you here and get on the train without you . " " I 've got eight bucks . " " Okay . Then pay for your own ticket . And stop hassling me . " Parker got in line for a ticket . John Joel stood in the line oppositehim and watched him out of the corner of his eye . Parker was sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hot . Parker got this way a lot : He 'd harp on something that did n't make any sense to begin with , and he would n't quit until somebody reallyp125sat on him . He was always shoved around in school . In fact , John Joel did n't really pal around with Parker in school . It was easy to avoid Parker , because Parker was twelve , and two classes ahead of him . When Parker was n't around , he 'd laugh with the other kids at things Parker said and did . But during the summer he saw a lot of Parker . Parker was always coming over , and nobody else called him when school was over . He called people a couple of times to see if they were home , but their parents always answered , so he could n't be sure . He hung up when their parents answered . Parker got his ticket first and walked away , heading for the gate . John Joel wondered if Parker would wait for him , or if Parker expected him to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't waiting , he was n't going to look for him . He did n't care if Parker 's mother gave him a ride home from the station or not . He 'd call his own mother . She did n't like Parker , and if he told her they 'd had a fight , she 'd probably be glad . Parker was waiting , just inside the gate . He was standing and watching a woman arguing with a man . The man was in his early twenties and he had a magazine that he was trying to give the woman , and she was objecting . She tried to involve one of the conductors in the discussion , but he walked past the two of them as if they were n't there . A lot of people began to come through the gate ; a few looked at the two people quarreling , but nobody but Parker actually stood and watched . John Joel tried to get his attention so he 'd move  --  they always kept the doors on the damn train closed until you 'd walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on the train , where it might be cool . He sighed and stared at Parker . In another few seconds the man walked off , and the woman stood there , talking to herself . " It was a wig , " she kept saying . John Joel gestured for Parker to come on . Parker paid no attention , and John Joel decided to give him ten more seconds and then start walking . Parker was crazy if he thought the woman was n't going to turn on him and start giving him a rough time if he continued to stand there . Parker was always getting involved in situationswhere he 'd put his face in the middle of something . It was happening now ; the woman , slowly realizing that Parker was there , was turning toward him , complaining . Parker listened , a silly smirkp126on his face . Then , after a few sentences , he interrupted the woman , and John Joel was amazed to hear him asking her if she believed in the Kingdom of Heaven . " The real Kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not some man in a wig . That magazine was n't really about Heaven . " And then John Joel watched as Parker said something he could n't understand . The woman did n't get it , either ; she leaned forward and cocked her head . She stopped talking . Parker was doing all the talking . He was holding out the picture to her , still in its wrapping , telling her that the other man was just testing her , and that she had passed the test . Her reward was a picture of herself in the Afterlife . The woman began swaying as he talked to her . " Who are you ? " John Joel heard the woman say . She began to back away from Parker . The crowds were thinningout . They were going to miss the train . He decided to give him five more seconds , and then walk away . Parker was getting into another one of his crazy routines , and what he was doing was sure not to make any sense . He stared , along with the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand , then pushed the package toward her . " You might as well see it , " Parker said . " This is who you 're going to be . " The woman reached out for the package just as John Joel turned and began to walk quickly toward the train . There was n't going to be a seat , just because Parker was so crazy , just because he was always kidding around . He turned to see Parker running behind him and the woman ripping open the package . A man with a beer can in his hand and a briefcase in his armpit rushed past her , past John Joel and Parker , mumbling to himself . " Now what are you going to tell your mother ? " John Joel said . " I gave it away , did n't I ? " Parker said . " Did n't I tell you ? " John Joel sat down in the first seat he saw . He did n't care if Parker stood all the way . But when he turned around he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Joel had been right about feeling Parker staring at the back of his head . Okay : So Parker had given away the picture , if that meant so much to him . He wondered why he felt guilty himself ; he wondered if the right thing to do was n't to get off the train and run back and try to get the picture , if the crazy woman was still there . The doors closed and the train started to move out of the station.  |p127They  had n't bought eclairs , and he was hungry . He had the nervousfeeling in his stomach that meant he ought to eat something soon . He decided he 'd get some peanuts from the bar car . Walkingdown the aisle past Parker , he was surprised to see that Parker had his bandanna out , and was rubbing his eyes . Parker was crying . Sitting on the train , crying . John Joel kept walking , and pretendednot to know him.  |p128When  they got off the train , John Joel waited on the platform for Parker . He half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . His eyes were n't red and the bandanna was back in his pocket . Parker had gotten so sweaty that his shirt clung to him in rivulets of wrinkles . Parker shook his head to the side , and if his hair had n't been so damp , it would have fallen across his forehead the way Parker liked it to . He gave up and smoothed it straight back , and as he walked , he took a cigarette out of the package and put it in his mouth . He did his trick of lighting a match by bending one forward , closing the book , and striking it with his thumb . He held the match to the cigarette and shook the flame out . " I 'm walking , " Parker said . " Walking ? All the way home ? You 'd never be able to walk all the way home . " " She wo n't do shit to me , " Parker said . " She knows I 'd tell the shrink . She 's gon na be half-crocked by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker . Call . "  | " I 'm not going to New York with you anymore , " Parker said . John Joel sighed and kept walking . He felt guilty about the picturebeing gone and did n't know why . It was n't his fault . Parker was always acting crazy , and it was his mother 's fault for asking him to do an errand like that . He tried to imagine what his own mother would do if she had sent him for a picture and he had done what Parker did . She 'd probably find some way to start talking about her dog . It would probably remind her of her dog . " You 'll get your money , " Parker said . " Give me the stubs and I 'll show them to her and you 'll get your money . " John Joel reached in his pants pocket . His pants were tight , and he had to worm his finger down hard to bring up the two small ticket stubs . He handed them to Parker , and Parker smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sidewalk , away from where everybody was walking . He put one stub on top of the other and squatted . John Joel knew what he was going to do . He was going to light them . He wanted to fight with Parker . He was afraid of getting hurt , but he was so tired of Parker and his craziness that he wanted to hit him . Instead , before he really thought about it , he tried to push Parker over , but Parker just braced himself with his left arm and did n't fall . His right hand was already holding the burning match to the ticket stubs . Some man with a briefcase looked over his shoulder at the two of them , and John Joel met the man 's eyes . The man gave a little smile and kept walking . John Joel kept watching him , but he went into the bar across from the station without turning around again . John Joel stared at the door of the bar , at the other people walkingin . Then he shrugged and sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you burned them , " John Joel said . " You do n't want to be friends , we do n't have to be friends . " He walked away . He hoped that Parker would n't follow him , because he thought there was going to be a fight . Only he did n't think that he was going to start it anymore : He thought that Parker was . He kept walking and did n't turn around . He was trying to think where the nearest phone was , so that he could call his mother to come get him . As he walked , he kept thinking of the woman in the picture , and how ugly some women could be . Hep130wondered what Parker 's mother was going to do to him , whether Parker might not tell her what he 'd really done . Then she was there : Parker 's mother , in the Oldsmobile convertible , a white visor pulled low on her forehead . She played tennis all day and got very tan in the summer . When she pulled over and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweatbandon her wrist . " Where 's Parker ? " she said . He shrugged . " Back at the train , " he said , guessing . " Well , why is he there ? " Marge Pendergast was sitting next to her , drinking something from a Styrofoam cup . Her hair was all tangled , and she was n't brushing it out of her eyes . They both had on tennis dresses . " Get in , " Parker 's mother said . " I had a feeling you 'd get this train . " " Nah , " he said . " Thanks . I 've got to go somewhere . " " What are you talking about ? " Parker 's mother said . " I 'm giving you a ride home . Where 's Parker ? " " At the train , " John Joel said again . " You really do n't want a ride ? " Parker 's mother said . " No , thanks . " " Go on , " Marge Pendergast said . " I 'm hot and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here , why do n't you get in the car and we 'll find Parker and I can drop you where you 're going . " " No , " he said , and turned and started to walk away from the car . He listened for the car to pull away , and in a few seconds it did , with a screech of tires . He wondered if she 'd find Parker , and he half hoped that he was gone  --  that there was no chance that she 'd find him and that Parker would try to blame him , somehow , for the lost picture . He wondered if that woman in the picture ever suspected how she 'd end up , the trouble her picture would cause . He regretted all the money he 'd spent on Parker . He wished that he had another friend , because even if Parker called him , he was n't ever going to see him again . A mile up the road , he went into the food store and bought Pe p peridge Farm Mint Milanos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to buy them , two bites to a cookie . Outside the store , when he finished the first layer , he took the paper cupp131out and wadded it until he made it into a ball in his fist . Then he threw it , as if he meant to strike somebody out . The ball had no weight and only went a few feet before it hit the ground . " Why do n't you pick that up ? " a woman in the parking lot said , opening her car door . He had only gone a few yards when he felt , for the first time , a painful sting : He had gotten a blister on his little toe in New York.  | " COME WITH ME , " Louise said . " It 'll be fun . It 'll be more fun than lying around the house all day . " " I do n't want to , " John Joel said . " Come on , " Louise said . " Tiffy 's made lots of picnic food and we 'll go berry-picking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come help me . " " Mary does n't have to come . " " Mary is at Angela 's . Come on . Why do I have to urge my children to move ? It 's not going above eighty today . It 's a perfect day to pick berries . " " Why ca n't I stay here ? " John Joel said . " To tell you the truth , you can . But I wish you 'd come with me . I know you 're depressed about something , and if you wo n't tell me , at least let me try to cheer you up . " " I do n't like Tiffy , " he said . " How could you not like Tiffy ? You 'll like her . You hardly know her . Your father badmouths every woman I know . Do n't pick up all your father 's prejudices . " " I do n't even see him , " John Joel said . " You see him on the weekends , " Louise said . " Come on . If wep133start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm in a good mood today . " " What am I supposed to say to people who want to know how come he 's never around ? " " Is that what 's bothering you ? " Louise said . She sat on the sofa , across from the chair where he was sitting and reading a Zap comic . He nodded yes . It was a lie , but he wanted to see what she 'd say. , " Say we 're separated , " she said . " He 's here on the weekends , " John Joel said . He had n't wanted her to say that . He had n't thought she would . " Ask your father what you should say . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's an adequate answer to nosy people to say we 're separated . " " It 's going to be plenty hot getting berries today . " " I think you can stand it . Last time : Are you coming ? " He put down the comic book and got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , " he said again , but he did n't want her to be coming , and he knew that his mother knew that . She did n't say anything . She got up and stretched and went into the kitchen and began taking containers out of the cabinet . " Wear an old shirt and shorts so it does n't matter if they get stained , " she said . He went upstairs . It had been three days since he and Parker had been in New York , and Parker had n't called him to apologize . Even if he had , he would n't have seen Parker again , but he wanted to be able to hang up on him . He hoped that Parker had gotten into trouble with his mother . He tried to put on his madras shorts , but they would n't zip up all the way . He put on a pair of cut-off denim shorts that did n't button , but that zipped and that had a reliable zipper . He put on a white shirt with a rip down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tree . His mother never mended things that were ripped . She 'd approve of his choosing this shirt to go berry-picking in . " Why are you so blue today ? " she said when he came downstairs . " I 'm not . Lay off . "  | " I ca n't even inquire about how my children are feeling without being told to lay off ? " " I thought we were going out , " he said . " As soon as I find a bag to put these containers in . " " What 's for lunch ? " he said . " I do n't know . Tiffy 's bringing a picnic . " " Chicken , " he said . " I 'll bet you . " " It probably is chicken . Will that be all right with you ? " He held the door open for her . She walked out , swinging the bag she was carrying , humming a song . The car was hot inside from sitting in the sun . She opened her door , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that door . Heat poured out of the car . " You never told me what you did in New York , " she said , getting in her side , throwing the bag into the back seat . He got in and closed his door . His shorts were tight across his stomach . " Nothing much , " he said . " Nothing much . New York City . If you want some suggestions , I can offer a few the next time you go in . " " I 'm sick of New York , " he said . " It 's too hot in the summer . " " Take the boat out to the Statue of Liberty . Remember when we all did that last summer ? Or the summer before , I guess . I love that ride . It 's not too long , and it 's so cool . I was telling your father that we ought to go to Nantucket this summer and rent a boat for a week . Would you like that ? " " Sure . I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we gang up on him , he 'll take us . " " Is n't he taking a vacation ? " John Joel said . " Of course he 'll take a vacation . But we 're going to have to persuade him to take it in Nantucket . " " Maybe he 's going on vacation alone , " John Joel said . His mother was turning on the air conditioning , steering with one hand as she rolled up her window . " Why do you say that ? " she said . He shrugged . " Maybe he 'd go alone . " " Did he say that to you ? " " No , he did n't say it . I just thought that since you 're separated he might not take a vacation with us this year . "  | " Yes he will , " his mother said . She did n't sound sure . The air conditioning was already making his knees cold . He drew up his legs . " Are you going to tell me about the fight you had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any fight . He 's just stupid . " " I 'm not too crazy about him myself . Did something happen in New York with Parker  --  is that why you do n't want to go back ? " " I 'm going back next week . I 've got to get braces , do n't I ? " " I mean for fun . And yes , you have to get braces . I know you do n't like the idea , but you would n't like crooked teeth when you grew up , either . " " I would n't care . " " You 'd care then . " " I would n't care , " he said again . " God , " she said , sighing . " Maybe you would n't . You 're a pretty blase kid . " " What does that mean ? " " Blase ? It means you let everything roll off your back like water . " She smiled . " I did n't realize what an old-fashioned expression that was , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full stop at stop signs . It drove him crazy . A dog was running at the side of the road . He waited for her to say something about her dog . She looked , but did n't say anything . " I 'll tell you one thing Parker did . We went to the museum and he told me his mother would pay me back if I showed her the tickets , and then he  --  " He broke off , and decided it would be better to hedge on the truth . " Parker tore up the ticket stubs . " " On purpose ? " " Sure , on purpose . " " What was the point of that ? " she said . He shrugged . " He 's stupid . " " The other thing that surprises me is that you went to a museum . What did you see ? " " Where 'd you think we 'd go ? Some porn movie ? " " I do have some faith in you , John Joel . I just did n't think the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's wonderful that you did . "  | " Really ? And you liked it and went back ? " " I sort of liked it . It was these plaster people . " " Oh , " she said . " You saw the Segal show at the Whitney . " He shrugged . " Well , tell me about it , " she said . " I read what he wrote about one of the things , and he said it was his friends . One of them was all blue , and it had a face like a goat . " " I 'd like to see that , " she said . " Some of it was dumb , " he said . He decided not to tell her about the people naked in bed , or the women 's bodies . " Do you like Nick ? " she asked him . " Sure . He 's okay . " " Just okay ? " " I do n't love him or anything . " " Your father does . Your father worships him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , " he said . " Maybe I 'm just jealous , " she said . She turned down the air conditioner . They were passing the reservoir , with the geyser of white water shooting up . " Nick 's got a pretty girlfriend , " he said . " A lot of them , " she said . " Was this one black or foreign ? Or white for a change ? " " She had huge eyes and she was pretty . She worked at some department store . Nick was surprised to see her , when she showed up outside the museum . Dad was late . He finally showed . " " Nick finds a new one every week , " she said . " Her name was Nina , " he said . " I just remembered . " " Nina who works in a department store . Let me guess : Bloomie 's ? " " She did n't say . " " Bloomie 's . And she was twenty-five , right ? " 137 " You would have liked her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About , " he said . " They do n't come over twenty-five . That model gets discon-tinued . " " You sound like you 're talking to Dad . "  | " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I guess I envy those lunches  --  flirting with somebody nice , all of it paid for with an expense account . " " You want to flirt with somebody ? " he said . " Oh , you know what I mean . Or maybe you do n't . " " You should n't dislike Nick , " he said . " He 's okay . " " So I hear . Constantly . " " You 're the one who wanted to talk about him , " he said . They were going up the steep hill that led to Tiffy 's house . Anotherdog , out on a lawn ; this time it was a German shepherd , the kind his mother 's had been , and he would have bet all the money in his wallet that she 'd say something . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day Mr. Blue was hit by a car . His own scream had sounded like a woman 's , and his mother had opened her mouth but made no sound at all . The paper boy  --  there had been a new paper boy , and he would throw the paper onto the lawn from the other side of the street . . . his mother 's dog had been standing at the side of the house , and it had seen the paper boy raise his arm with the rolled-up paper , and suddenly the dog had gone bounding into the street because he thought the paper boy was playing " get the stick " with him . He had lunged into a car with a heavy thump . Now , John Joel looked at his mother . She was looking in the rear-view mirror and had seen the dog , but was n't saying anything . She said : " This is pretty in here . It 's quiet , too  --  off the main road . " " Do you wish you worked in New York ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I thought you might . " " Sometimes , " she said . " Sometimes I like it here . I think I 'm lucky that we have enough money that I do n't have to work and that when the sun is shining and I 'm feeling pretty good , I can go meet a friend and have a picnic and pick strawberries . It 's a pretty nice life . " She came to a full stop at the stop sign , then went slowly forward about twenty feet and stopped again , where she could see . " I do n't know what kind of a job I could get anyway , " she said . " Tiffy 's got a job . " " Tilly has a Ph.D . and teaches at NYU and will probably be booted out before she gets tenure , on general principles . " " Could n't you be a teacher ? " he said.  | " What 's this ? You 're trying to send your mother off to work ? " " Just if you wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . " " Thank you , " she said . " Seriously . I 'm glad you have faithin me . " While he was n't looking , a little dog ran across a lawn close to the car , and she said , " I wish I had had a job when Mr. Blue died . I do n't know why I took it so hard , but to this day it 's all I can do to look at a dog that reminds me of Mr. Blue in any way . That one was nothing like him  --  just the way it was having fun , running across the lawn after something . " " I was talking about the cats to Parker . He said his mother told him to drown them . " " You should n't talk about that , " his mother said . " He 's going to a psychiatrist . Things like that you should probably leave to the two of them to talk about . " " Yeah , but you do n't even think he should tell the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got around . I do n't know how it did . I think his mother told some people . I think part of Parker 's problem is that his mother is more interested in everybody else than she is in her own son . " " Yeah , but he said it was an alley cat . " Louise laughed . " A two-hundred-dollar chocolate point , " she said . " That 's crazy , too : his mother paying that kind of money for a cat , and then having it put to sleep . It was n't the cat 's fault that he tried to go after it and the kittens . You 'd think at least she would have tried to find a good home for it . " " She 's pretty strange , too , " John Joel said . " Everybody is , I guess . Everybody has their little secrets and their little half-truths . All those people at lunch in New York hedging and dodging like football players . " " I know something about her even she does n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah . I should n't tell . " " How could you know something she does n't know ? " " Promise you wo n't tell ? " Louise shrugged . " I ca n't imagine what I 'd find out about her that I 'd care about . All she does is play tennis , anyway . Does it have to do with her tennis game ? "  | " No . It 's that Parker put a pinhole in her diaphragm . " Louise snapped her head around to look at him . " What did you say ? " she said . He blushed . Parker had had to explain to him what it meant . Now he knew what it meant , and he was suddenly embarrassed to have mentioned it . He should have told her , instead , about the naked plaster people in the museum . " What ? " she said again . " Parker did it . With a pin . " " Parker said he did it . Parker would n't do that , would he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " She was still staring at him . " You realize  --  " she began . " I know , " he said , and shrugged . " Parker thinks it 's a real good joke . He says it 's her fault if she does n't check . " " But that 's awful , " she said . " Parker found it . It was in her top drawer . He thought it was a big compact . He opened it and did n't see any mirror , and then he found out later what it was , and he pricked a hole in it . " " She 'll see it , wo n't she ? " Louise said . " Does Parker think that 's funny ? She 'd never dream Parker would find her diaphragm and do that . " " She ought to . He 'd do anything . " " What do you mean ? " Louise said . " Has he done something worse than that ? " " He just does strange stuff . What I told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He burned them , on the sidewalk outside the train station . He does stuff there 's no point in doing . " " He 's very disturbed . " " He 's no friend of mine , " John Joel said . " But honey  --  are you sure about that other thing ? Might n't he just brag that he 'd pulled a stunt like that but not really do it ? " " No , " John Joel said . " He 'd do it . He would n't care . " " Imagine Georgia having another little monster like Parker , " Louise said . She brushed her hair out of her face . " I did n't know you knew what a diaphragm was , " she said . IIe blushed again , looked out the window . " I knew , " he said . " But that 's just horrible , " she said . " Parker 's a monster . " " He rolls cigarettes like they 're joints , but they 're not . He car/ries them in the pack with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hand cupped around them and he drags on them funny , like they 're joints . He smokes a pack a day of real cigarettes . " " You do n't smoke with him , do you ? " " He 's no friend of mine . " " But do you ? " " No , " John Joel said . He was embarrassed that he did n't , that he was n't lying to her . He did n't know why he 'd told her so much . He slid forward in the seat and looked out the window , as they pulled into Tiffy 's driveway . There were day lilies , very tall , falling forward into the driveway , and there were daisies and tall electricpinkphlox . Tiffy 's husband was working in the garden , staking a rosebush . He waved with a pair of pruning shears . " Hi , " Louise said , getting out of the car . " Tiffy inside ? " " She 's in the garage , " he said . " Hi , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " John Joel said . " Hi , Tiffy , " Louise called . Tiffy came out of the garage , wiping her forehead on her arm . She had her hair in braids , and for a secondthat made her look , to John Joel , a little like Nina , in New York . She had on white shorts , and a white halter top , and she was carrying a plant she had just repotted . " I have to take a quick shower and then I 'm all ready to go , " she said . " Come inside where it 's cool . " They followed her into the house . Louise pulled out a chair and sat at the kitchen table . John Joel pulled out a chair for himself and sat down . The shorts were cutting into his thighs . It smelled like chicken in her kitchen , and he looked at the clock to see how close to lunchtime it was . It was noon . If he were home , he could be eating . " There 's wine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on in the shower . Louise did n't get up . " Do you want a Coke if she has one ? " she said . He shook his head no . He wanted a Coke , but he wanted more to get out of the house . He wanted to pick the berries and have the picnic and have it over with . The magazine on the table was n't worth looking at : The New Republic . All Tiffy 's cups werep141pottery , and Coke tasted funny in cups like that . He thought about the milkshake he had bought Parker and wished he had his money back . Louise got up and took a blue pottery cup down from the shelf over the sink and went to the refrigerator . She poured wine into her cup from the jug and put the jug back in the refrigerator . Tiffy 's refrigerator was always interesting : It was filled with colors instead of with wrapped packages : apples loose on a shelf , peaches , limes and lemons , pale-:sea-green bottles of Perrier , orange juice in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tiffy was hollering something from upstairs , but they could n't tell what she was saying . She came down in a few minutes , in green slacks and a black halter , wearing tennis shoes , her hair still braided , but sopping wet . " Let 's go , let 's go , " she said , picking up the basket on the kitchen table . She said to John Joel : " What are you doing this summer ? " " Nothing much , " he said . " My car , " Tiffy said . " I cleaned it inside , and everybody has to praise it . " " It looks wonderful , " Louise said . " I want to sit in the back , " John Joel said . " There 's no place to vacuum your car around here , " Tiffy said . " I gave up . Last night I wet a sponge and sponged this car clean . It was full of grit and dog hair from my sister 's dog . It looked horrible . Does it smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tiffy waved to her husband as she pulled out of the driveway . He had on a straw hat , and he tipped it as the car pulled away . " Now tell me what you 've really been doing this summer , " Tiffy said , looking in the rear-view mirror . He slid around in the back scat . He could n't think what to tell her except to tell the story about going to the museum again . So he told her about the show he had seen , or tried to , but she broke in : She 'd seen it , too . And Calder 's Circus . She started talking about that , how quirky it was , how it always made her smile to see it . How she wanted to shrink and get inside with the circus animals and performers , and tumblearound in the case with them at night , because she was sure they did . " I do n't know , " she said to Louise . " Maybe I 'm just get/ting old , but when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt like those things were so still , and when I stopped to look at Calder 's Circus again on the way out , I felt like they had little hearts beating , and that their little eyes blinked and their mouths smiled when they were alone . When Segal 's people were alone , I thought they 'd be just as still . That they could n't move , under any conditions . " Tiffy 's car was an old Cadillac , a black 1955 Cadillac , and it rode as though the shocks were completely worn-out . He had been in her car once before , and he just remembered that it had made him sick . It was hot in the back seat , too , even though Tiffy was drivingfast enough that wind blew through the car and slapped him in the face . He tried to concentrate on not being sick . He kept thinkingabout the picture of the relative that Parker had given away , of how strange the woman in the picture looked . Pictures of his mother when she was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like Parker 's funny-faced relative , but the pose was the same : The faces looked flat , and they were close to the camera . There was a picture on his father 's dresser  --  what used to be his father 's dresser  --  of his mother when she graduated from high school . It was a hand-colored photograph , his mother had told him , and the pearls she wore around her neck were the same color as her teeth and the whites of her eyes . She had on a pink sweater in the picture , and a barrette in her hair , and he could not imagine his mother looking that way . As mothers went , she was pretty . She wore a little make-up , unlike Tiffy , and she did n't have a horsey face like Parker 's mother , and nobody was as ugly as Marge Pendergast . All her children were ugly , too . He wished that he looked more like his mother or father . He wondered if he would be better-looking if he were n't fat . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he thought that was true objectively not just because she was his sister and he hated her . Going back to his grandmother 's house in Rye , the day he had had lunch with Nick and his father and the girl whose name he had forgotten again , his father had asked him if he liked any girls . He hated to be asked that , because there were n't any girls he liked . So he had made up a lie about a girl he had liked who had transferred to another school in the middle of the year . Ile had evenp143described her : bangs , glasses , tall . They had been in the drinking car , standing up . He had been having a ginger ale , and his father had been having a gin and tonic . " What girls do you like ? " he had asked his father . It had just come out , before he realized what a ridiculous question it was . His father had been taken aback by it . His father had said that he liked Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " his father had asked him after a while . And for some reason he had n't wanted to let on that he thought she was pretty . He had shrugged . His father had said , " Not your type , huh ? " There was another long pause ; then , finishing his drink , his father had said : " Well , I think she 's quite pretty . " In the front seat , Louise was telling Tiffy about the last picnic the family had gone on . " There were these two silly girls at the park on Friday night . They were with two boys , and all four of them were drunk , and I actually envied them for having such a mindless good time . " " There 's nothing wrong with having a mindless good time once in a while . " " At least I said something that night that I 'd wanted to say for a long while . Not that there was any response to it , but I finally said it . It was about my dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and that I could be playing get the stick ' with Mr. Blue . No wonderI liked the dog . It was so dogged . It was just like me . It would 've played get the stick ' until it fell over dead , and I 'd go on those stupid picnics and trudge through the snow if he kept saying we should go there . " Louise sighed . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I talk about the dog too much . " " You do n't talk about it very much , " Tiffy said . " She does , " John Joel said . " All the time . " Tiffy pulled into a graveled drive , in the shape of a half circle , and parked behind a yellow truck . Tiffy had found out about this place from a friend : It was n't advertised , but one day a week the farmer let people come and pick berries , and he weighed them on a scale on his back porch . Tiffy always knew about things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments , places to pick strawberries , places to swim without getting caught , books that had been written but not published . Whenever she talked about a book , she 'd say : " You have to read it when it comes out , "  |p144and  when she talked about a movie she 'd seen , it was always " at a screening . " He could understand why his mother was in awe of Tiffy , but she was so unlike his mother in so many ways that he was surprised his mother liked her so much . According to his mother , Tiffy did everything right . His father did n't take Tiffy seriously . His father just thought that Tiffy was pretentious and talked a lot . He hoped that his mother would n't tell his father about this day on the weekend , because they were sure to get into a fight about it . As he followed his mother and Tiffy through the high grass to the strawberry field , he picked up snatches of the conversation . Tiffy was talking about what was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressing that word  --  politically . His mother nodded and did n't have much to say . It was hot in the field , and he wished he had on looser clothes . Tiffy had left the basket with the food back in the car . They probably would n't be eating for another hour . He swatted a yellow butterfly away , and when it flutteredhe saw that it was a butterfly and a smaller butterfly , or a moth . They swirled up and flew away . A mosquito buzzed in his ear . There were about ten people over the crest of the hill , picking strawberries that grew in neat rows . He hated the idea of bending over in the heat to pick berries and wondered why he 'd come . There was no way out of it . He took the container his mother held out and went to one of the rows and began groping under the leaves for the berries . Every berry was ripe and large , so it did n't matter what he pulled off . He thought about the pie his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd make two . He hoped that Mary would eat at Angela 's . His mother and Tiffy were talking about his father . He moved to another row , where he would n't hear them . He had found out enough . He had found out they were separated . He suddenly felt sorry for himself , and a little dizzy in the heat : What if they had done it when he was a baby , what if they had given him away , even , and he had been an orphan ? It would be nice if they had given Mary away and kept him . Brandt was already gone . He enviedParker for being an only child and wondered what made him so messed up when he did n't have anybody lie had to share things with or be polite to , except his parents . Nobody would put crapp145in Parker 's bed that he 'd roll over on or cut his foot on . If Parker thought it would be fun to have a brother or a sister , he should just spend a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had bought Parker two hamburgers and French fries and a Coke and a chocolate milkshake , and Parker had set fire to the ticket stubs . He bent over too far and lost his balance and remembered shoving Parker and not knocking him over . He thought about seeing Parker one more time  --  maybe waiting until fall and ganging up on him with some of the other kids  --  and letting him have it . Then Parker would have something to tell his shrink about . Then he could talk about how he was such an asshole that he 'd gotten slugged . " Are you scowling ? " his mother said , " or is the sun too much for you ? " " Sun , " he said . " Do you think we have enough ? " she said . He nodded yes . He thought that Tiffy would want to keep picking , though , and he guessed right . He and his mother started back for the farmer 's porch before Tiffy did . " What 's the matter ? " she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always asking me what I 'm doing and how I 'm doing and what girls do I like ... " " Who asked you that ? " she said . What had he said that for ? He did n't want to go into it . " Parker , " he said . " Normal enough questions , all of them , are n't they ? " she said . " Yeah , " he said , kicking a rock . " Everything 's normal . " " Well , " she said , " I would n't say that about Parker . " " He 's not my friend anyway , so I do n't care . " " I think he is your friend , " she said . " Why do n't you call him and make up ? " " Make up ? He 's an asshole . Parker 's an asshole . " " I think he 's disturbed , but everybody can make mistakes . Maybe you ought to overlook what he did the other day , if it 's going to bother you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does n't bother me , " he said . " It bothers me that I do n't have many friends . Tiffy 's my best friend , and I do n't have a world in common with her . Sometimes I just think she feels sorry for me . " " Why would she feel sorry for you ? "  | " What reason would she have for liking me so much ? There 's the whole faculty of NYU to talk to if she gets lonesome , and she always knows better than I do what 's going on . She tells me about things . I never tell her about things . " " You tell her about Dad . " " Does that bother you ? That I talk to people ? " " I do n't care who you talk to , " he said . " You say that you do n't care so much that I do n't know when you 're serious . " She ate one of the strawberries . " Good , " she said . " I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . " " Parker 'd probably burn them . He 'd probably pick them , then try to light them . " " Strawberries flambe ? " she said . " Maybe people just take Parker too seriously . " " How come you 're on his side all of a sudden ? " " Oh , I 'm not really on his side . I just hate to think so badly of him when he 's just a twelve-year-old child . I was pretty strange when I was twelve years old . " " How ? " he said . " Well , I guess you 'd call it being very straight . I would n't let anybody cut my hair . My hair was my proudest possession . And I was very shy and very quiet . I played the piano . Did you know that ? " " What for ? " he said . " What for ? " " Yeah . Did you want to be in an orchestra or something ? " " I never thought about it . I just liked music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days girls did n't think in terms of a career , the way they do now . " " Huh , " he snorted . " Mary with a career . " " Mary 's very interested in music , actually . " " Junk music . " " She likes music . That 's the important thing . " " I like to think about Mary having a career . She could be a nurse and do mercy killings . " " If you did some nice things for your sister , she might do some nice things for you . "  | " What ? Leave me alone ? " " I do n't know what the truth of that is either , John Joel . Do you two really dislike each other that much ? " " I 'd just as soon have Parker for a brother as her as a sister . " He ate a strawberry . He wished it were a cookie . " She 's just as crazy as Parker is . " " You know she is n't . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " " Never mind . I 'm not ratting on Mary . " " Why did you say it if you did n't want me to know ? " He did n't answer her , because the farmer was on his way out of the house to greet them . " Going to make a pumpkin pie , are you ? " he joked , looking at all the containers filled with strawberries . Tiffy was running to catch up with them . " There 's a little snake in the grass . It 's thin , and had stripes , and it was about this long . " She held her hands apart . The farmer pretended to be horrified . He spread his arms as wide as they 'd go . " Is it just harmless ? " Tiffy said . " It did n't go away when I was picking , it came toward me , sort of . " " Friendly , " the farmer said . " Just a grass snake . " " I was so nervous I left my basket up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " will you go get it for her ? " He took his time going back with the basket , and he swung it and let some of the strawberries fall out . He was thinking that Nick would n't give Tiffy the time of day . He thought Nick was a lot cooler than Tiffy . He wondered , because he liked Nick more than any of his mother 's women friends , if he was a queer . When he got back with the basket , Tiffy was talking to his mother. " ... the role of women in certain fairy tales , " Tiffy was saying . " I guess it 's obvious to people now that most often it 's the women who are monsters or the ones who have to wait for Prince Charming . But I was wondering today what those fairy tales would sound like if even the most evil , stupid women told it from their perspective . Even granting that they were evil . I wonder if a lot of them were n't evil just because they were so worn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he chooses this as his work , thenp148let him have the long days , the cold and the risk . Let him pull with all his might , and instead of coming up with a fat , golden bass , let him snag a sunken tire . Let it be as round as the world , with a great hole in the center . " Tiffy was talking loudly and waving her arms . " If that 's what the man wants , then let him have that . " He handed the basket to his mother . " Thank you , " Tiffy said , reaching for it . " That was awfully nice of you . " " How come you 're a feminist and you 're afraid of snakes ? " " What ? " Tiffy said , looking embarrassed . " Being afraid of a snake has to do with politics ? " " John Joel , " his mother said . " What about lunch ? " he said . He was tired of waiting for it . The farmer tipped the berries onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white pad stained with strawberry juice . He showed her the figure but did n't read it out loud , as if it were confidential . Tiffy reached into her pants pocket and handed him a ten-dollar bill . " Maybe there 's someplace cooler than here to have a picnic , " his mother said . " Let 's go somewhere near the water , if you feel like it . " " It 's fine with me , " Tiffy said . " Actually , we could sit under the big tree in my backyard if you 'd like to . Is n't that crazy ? To put everything in a picnic basket and then end up on the back lawn ? Like some funny French film or something . " " Her car makes me sick , " John Joel said to his mother , loud enough for Tiffy to hear him . " What ? " his mother said . She also looked hot . He thought that if he had n't come along , his mother and Tiffy would probably have had a good time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had insisted  --  almost insisted  --  that he come . At least he was better company than Mary . Mary was always looking for a fight , and all he wanted to do was keep quiet . " It makes me carsick , " he said . " Well , sit in the front this time and see if that makes it better , " his mother said . " I 'll sit in the back . " " That 's not going to help , " he said . He did n't know if it would or not , but he did n't want his mother in the back seat . He did n't want to ride next to Tiffy , and he did n't want his mother to have to be in the back . " Forget it , " he said . " I did n't puke . "  | " John Joel , " she said , " do n't be ridiculous . It 's nothing to be ashamed of if you felt sick . We 'll have Tiffy drive slower , and there wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think . " " Come on , " he said , kicking a rock . They were in the driveway now , and Tiffy was walking ahead of them . " Forget it , okay ? " he said . He knew that if his mother did n't forget it , he was going to cry . " Just give it a try , " his mother said . " I do n't want to , " he said . " Come on . Forget it . " " Why ? " she said . She put her hand on his shoulder and tried to get him to look at her . " Why does everybody try to fight me on the smallest thing ? " " Get off , " he said , shrugging her hand off . Her hand felt light on his shoulder , and warm . It made him realize how sweaty he was all over , once the material was pressed against his skin that way . Suddenlyhe wanted to be out of his clothes , somewhere cool . He thought about the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the museum . He thought that it would be wonderful to be so white and still . " Tiffy , " his mother said , " let John Joel ride up front with you . The motion in the back seat is making him sick . " " You do n't mind riding with a feminist ? " Tiffy said to him . " I did n't even want to come , " he said , whirling to face his mother . " What am I supposed to do , just let you lie around the house all summer ? You 're ten years old . You must be interested in something besides hanging out with your father and Nick and going to lunches with whatever pretty girl there is that week . Last summer you went fishing , " she said . " What 's gotten into everybody ? My son tells his father jokes about feminists , and my daughterhas to be forced to leave her shrine to Peter Frampton to endurean evening with the family . " " I 'm sorry , " Tiffy said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . " He tried to get in the back seat , but his mother climbed in before he could . She was faster than he was  --  faster and thinner , and she just squeezed around him . He glared at her , not appreciatingit at all . Ile got in next to Tiffy and rolled down his window . The strawberries were at his feet , and he had the urge to take hisp150foot and just start mashing them . He did have a better time with Nick and his father , and if he wanted to be left alone , he did n't see why he could n't be left alone . Mary got out of everything by having somewhere to go . She was always at Angela 's and he was around the house , so his mother picked on him . Maybe being an orphan was n't so bad ; if you were an orphan , maybe people did n't notice you all the time . He pushed his hair out of his eyes . Tiffy was humming , pretending everything was all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any effort to talk . And the car was going over ruts in the road , and he hoped again that he would n't be sick . He did n't want anything else to happen . He just wanted to go home . He wanted to eat . And he wanted to slam Parker into a wall , break his arm for the way he 'd acted . He was acting badly , he knew , but Parker acted even worse , and for that , he wanted to kill him . He was also sure that Parker had n't called  --  that if he had stayed there all day , he still would n't have had the pleasure of answering the phone and hearing Parker apologize , so he could hang up on him . His mother began laughing in the back seat . First just a sound he thought might be a hiccough , then a genuine laugh . She put her hand over her mouth and tried to stifle the laugh , but it was no good : She just took her hand away and fell over against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror . " Dare I ask ? " Tiffy said . " Oh , " Louise said , " I ca n't tell you , but I was thinking about a secret John Joel told me on the way over , and it just  --  " She could n't get her breath . He found himself smiling , though he did n't mean to . " It just puts everything in perspective . It 's such a dirty trick that one person pulled on another . I wish I had nerve like that , sometimes . I really do . It 's really really horrible , but it 's so awful and so funny . " She was wiping her eyes . He turned around and saw her wiping her eyes . " You ca n't tell , " he said . " Oh , " she said , " I was n't going to tell . It 's just all so ghastly . It 's selling you such a bill of goods to tell you that you should get married and have a family and be secure . Jesus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This sounds like a real whopper , " Tiffy said . " It is , " Louise said . " But do n't worry . It 's not somebody youp151ike . This is somebody who almost deserves it . " She started to laugh again , and he thought he was going to be sick  --  it was as if her laughter was shaking the car . There was noise in his head he could n't get rid of , and if he was going to not be sick , he needed to be quiet to fight it down . But it passed . It passed , and his mother stopped laughing and by the time they got to Tiffy 's she was n't even smiling . They had the picnic in the backyard , and when a bird flying over dropped its white shit on the sheet Tiffy had spread on the grass , Tiffy said it was symbolic . Her laughter was n't like his mother 's , though ; it sounded entirely different.  |p152They  were riding home from Tiffy 's house , and he was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad things about being ten years old was that he was n't yet six feet tall like his father , and in all kinds of small ways , being short was an embarrassment . If you were fully grown , you could look at something in a museum out of the corner of your eye if you did n't really want to be seen looking at it . You could stand in the drinkingcar of the train and just put your fingertips out to steady yourself when the train swayed or lurched , instead of having to reach up and hang on like a child . He always got tired standing on the train and wondered why his father did n't . It seemed that since his father was taller , and weighed more than he did  --  though not by much  --  that his father 's feet would hurt more than his did . " I 'm full of illusions about making an escape , " his father said . " Some days I think about it so much , in so many different situations , that I 'd out-worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the train . The cold blasts of air conditioning . The heavy door opening and closing again . Ile had wondered , standing and being shaken by the train , whether part of the reason his father wanted him to be escorted around New York did n't havep153to do with the fact that his father would envy him for getting lost . His father always arranged things for him to do and places for them to meet , when his father knew perfectly well that he and Parker went into the city on the train alone . Sometimes he envied Brandt for having his father around so much . He could n't remember how his father had acted toward him when he was a baby Brandt 's age , but he had thought , even then , that his father probablyliked him better than he liked Mary . Fathers liked sons better . But he knew that what his father had been saying on the train included him ; his father had meant escaping from all of them  --  not just to Rye , and not just by going into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the train , his father had said , " Not your type , huh ? " And he had been embarrassed that he was so young , that he did n't have a type , that he did n't think he ever would . If anybody liked him , ever , he would be grateful . The older girls he knew were like Mary , or worse . Angela was worse . He really could n't imagine the sort of girl he would ever like . - When it got time to kiss a girl , he would have braces on , and he 'd be embarrassed to do it . Thinking about it made him want to escape , too . " I guess Tiff y was n't all that nice to you today , " his mother said . " She can be pretty insensitive to people 's moods sometimes . " " I 'm not in a mood , " he said . " I just did n't want to go . I knew it would n't be any fun . " " What would your ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary out of the house , " he said . " Have the air conditioneron and read comics . No big deal . " " But would n't you like to do something exciting ? " his mother said . " What ? " he said . " Run around New York in the heat ? " " You and Tiff y are both depressing , " she said . " In your different ways . It 's so hard to really talk to either of you . You act like it 's a big effort to speak two consecutive sentences to me , and Tiffy just reacts to what interests her . When you told her about the show at the Whitney , she wanted to talk about Calder , and she did n't care what you had to say . " " She 's like a teacher , " he said . IIe put his fingers under the hand of his shorts and felt the skin wrinkled where the material had cut into his skin . " She is a teacher , " he said . " Figures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his mother said . " I never thought about that . I just think about all the things that she does  --  I never really thought about how good she was at them . " " You 're nicer than she is , " he said . " Well , " she said , " since you dislike her , I should hope so . " " Not my type , " he said . His mother laughed . " No , " she said . " I could tell that . " " Who 's your type ? " he asked his mother . " What an odd question to ask your mother . I 'm married to your father , so he must be my type , right ? " " Yeah , " he said , " but you 're separated . " " I 'm not looking for other men , if that 's what 's got you worried . " " A movie star or anybody , " he said . " I just meant do you alwayslike men like Dad ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not really my type , " she said . " Do you mean who do I think is good-looking ? " " Do you think Nick is ? " he said . " Definitely not my type , " she said . " But a lot of girls like him . " " Nick , " she said . " That 's a funny idea . We really do n't like each other . " She had come to a full stop at a stop sign and was n't starting away . " Donald Sutherland is good-looking , " she said . " Donald Sutherland in Klute . " " What are we sitting here for ? " he said . " I was just thinking for a second . " " Come on , " he said , " get going . " " It 's terrible , " she said , pulling away . " I do n't even have fantasiesanymore . " " What fantasies did you have ? " She started to laugh . " Unbelievable , " she said . " I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbia , and he 's asking me about what fantasies I used to have . Oh , it kills me . It kills me that a man , even if he 's ten years old , can still stump me . How did we start talking about this , John Joel ? "  | " I guess Tilly has always been a sort of fantasy . I guess I 've always wanted to think that she was nearly perfect , and that she had it all together , and that there was a way I could be like her . But I 'm not even so sure that 's true . " " Donald Sutherland , " he said . " Was he in that movie about football ? " The huge white fountain of water was blowing nearly sky-high in the reservoir . She slowed the car to look at it as they came up on it , and speeded up again when they passed the rows of tall trees that blocked their view . " I guess you always wonder , " she said , " if you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so beautiful here , and we do n't notice it very much , and when we do , it does n't seem to help us be happy . " She looked at John Joel . " You must think I 'm really silly , " she said . " Do you think I make a good adult ? " He wondered what would happen if both his parents made an escape at the same time . " My God , " his mother said . " All it 's going to take is one little sperm to wiggle its way through a pinhole , and she 'll never know . See that water ? " she said . " One microscopic sperm has got as much power as that . "  |p156JOHN  JOEL was in Parker 's bedroom . There was a poster of Donna Summer on the wall above Parker 's bed , and another poster of the Incredible Hulk . Parker had cut Donna Summer 's face out of the poster and put it in the Incredible Hulk 's hand . In the space where Donna Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mother . He had hung it behind the poster , frame and all . You could really tell that that face did not go with that long black hair . John Joel looked more closely at Donna Summer 's head in the hand of the Incredible Hulk . Parker had put a wad of gum over one of Donna Summer 's eyes . There was also a picture of Washingtoncrossing the Delaware in the room . On the glass , over Washington 's face , he had put another picture of Donna Summer 's head that he had cut out of a magazine . His mother was always asking him to straighten up his room . Parker kept a towel in his room , on a towel rack . Once he had gotten poison ivy after using the same towel his father had used when he had raked and burned leaves and showered , and since Parker had not been outside the house that day , he was sure that he had contracted poison ivy from his father 's towel . He boughtp157himself five red towels with money he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use them . His mother had said that he was being ridiculous , and that she would n't launder the towels  --  they 'd bleed for the first ten washings , probably . So Parker took care of his own towels : He arranged them a certain way on the towel rack , so he could tell if they 'd been tampered with , and he washed them in the basement sink , and he had never had poison ivy again . He had never forgiven his father , either . Before he got poison ivy , Parker would n't do yard work unless his father paid him , but after he got poison ivy , no amount of money would get him into the yard . Parker tossed down his comic book . The comic , which he 'd bought in New York , was called Endless Torture  --  it was a parody of genuine sadistic magazines  --  which Parker paid bums fifty cents to buy for him in the city . In the comic , people bleeding to death with their arms cut off were always trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their tongues ripped out were shown one frame later gagged with their own tongues . People spouted blood like fountains ; their arms and legs went sailing through the air like Frisbees ; their eyes really popped . Parker kept all the magazines and comics neatly laid out between his mattress and box spring . He knew where they all were ; he had their positionsmemorized the way a chess player can close his eyes and envisionall the pieces perfectly . He knew whether to lift the mattressnear the pillow or at the foot of the bed . He could also close his eyes and flip the book open to a given scene . The book would fall open exactly on , or maybe two or three pages before or after , the picture he had in mind . He also had a few men 's magazines : Playboy and Oui and Hustler . He liked the pictures in Hustler of what syphilis would do , and he gave thanks that the poison ivy had n't done anything like that to him . But these magazines were n't his favorites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Animal Antics . It told stupid fairy tales about animals , and there were black and white and a few color pictures of animals dressed up . Most of the pictures showed the animals ' genitals . Parker always thought the pictures were just as funny , even if he 'd just looked at them five minutes before : the monkey in the ballerina 's pink crinoline tutu bending over to get a banana , itsp158pink anus pointed at the camera ; a cow on its side , udders full , staring blankly at the camera , a big yellow bonnet on its head and blue make-up above its eyes . There were also close-ups of a bunch of red ants feeding on a Hershey 's Kiss melting in the sun , swarmingaround a discarded used prophylactic . Parker liked to stay in his room . He had a ten-speed Schwinn he had gotten for Christmas mounted on the wall of his room , and he never went out riding . He had skates that he had gotten the same Christmas that he sometimes put on and rolled around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did n't lift and a punching bag that he did n't punch . His father gave him the things for presents , thinking that he might lose weight if he were n't so sedentary . Parker would n't use them , and when his mother asked him to straighten up his room , he always repliedby asking her to have his father load out all the things that he had given him . There was a picture in Animal Antics of an ape in tennis shoes and a white sweatband around its head , slugginga punching bag that was painted with big breasts . In this , as in all of the pictures , the animal 's face was expressionless . " So when do you get your wires ? " Parker said . He opened his mouth and made his eyes big , imitating Jaws in the James Bond movies . Parker curled his fingers and pretended to be gripping something in midair . He cocked his head and slowly , with his eyes huge , pretended to be biting the thing in half . " See Moonraker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy as some of them , but it 's good . Jaws gets on Bond 's side for a while , and in space there 's a war and they blow off each other 's heads with lasers . " Parker twitched like a personbeing electrocuted . He was jerking his finger at John Joel , pretendingit was a gun . " You 'll get braces and look like Jaws , " Parker said . " But you 'd have to wear stilts . I wonder if you 're going to grow any taller . You 're supposed to start growing about now . I grew a lot in the last year . " " You 're still as ugly as a Baby Ruth . " " Listen to who 's talking . Brace face . " " A lot of people have got braces . " Parker hooked his big toe under the top of one sock and began to push it down . " Did you see Moonraker or not ? " Parker said . " I did n't see it yet . "  | " I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater . It 's still in New York , though . Do you want to go ? " " Where would you get the money ? " " I 've got ten bucks , smart-ass , " Parker said . " How 'd you get it ? " " I found it blowing down the street . Okay ? " " You took it from your mother 's purse again . " " Boy , " Parker said , slipping his sock onto the floor . " You 'd betterreport me to the Boy Scouts . A person like me is n't safe to take old ladies across the street . " Parker laughed . The other sock came off and he flipped it to the opposite side of the room . " What 'd you come over for if you wanted to act like an asshole ? " " You called me , Parker , " John Joel said . " Yeah . I call you and you act like you 're my girlfriend or something , and I hurt your feelings or something , and you hang up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer the door . I did n't want you standing out there like an asshole , hollering at the window all day , though . " " I ought to get going , " John Joel said . " Yeah . Now you want me to beg you to stay . You 're weird , man . " Parker raised his hands again and bit down , into air . " Jaws cuts the cable when they 're in this glassed-in car , riding down the mountain , " Parker said . " You know what my mother says about the movie ? She keeps talking about the girls in the movie , like it 's Miss America or something . Marge Pendergast was with us , and that creepy kid Stanley of hers , and she kept asking Marge how come the girl with Bond can run all around in those high-heeled shoes . They kept talking about how good the girl 's hair looked . They go to movies to see how women can run in high heels . " " What 's your mother hanging out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big fight . " " They did . But Marge is always up for playing tennis . My mother hates doubles , and Marge is always up for playing singles with her . I wonder what she looks like with her tits cut off . " Parker sucked at a mosquito bite on his wrist . " My father knew a guy that just had one ball . One dropped down and the other one did n't , so they ( lid something to look for the other ball , but it was n't in there . " " Who does your mother hang out with ? " Parker said.  |p160Tiffy  . " Yuck , " Parker said . " I saw her during that big snow last winter in these men 's work boots and this big parka of I guess her husband 's , in the grocery store , and she stopped and looked at me like I was weird . " Parker picked the cuticle of his big toe . " I 'll bet she 's twice as ugly as Marge Pendergast , even with her tits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something to scare the shit out of her . " " What would you do ? " " Just something . Scare the shit out of her . " Parker smiled . " You could bet she would n't come running out of a burning house in high heels . She 'd have on those manure clompers and she 'd probably be dressed up like a man and her husband would be dressed up like a woman . My mother says her husband 's faggy . She probably takes all his clothes and leaves him hers . " Parker smiled again . " I 've got an idea , " he said . " You want to send her something ? " " What do you mean , send her something ? " " You know that picture of her in the paper ? My mother 's got it around . That picture of the bunch of them , at the sale ? We can take one of these  --  " Parker rolled off the bed , and let himself fall to the floor . " Uggggh , " he groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come here , " Parker said . " Come on , I want to show you . " When Parker opened his bedroom door , he always looked both ways down the hallway . He did it even when he knew that nobody else was home . " This way , " Parker said , and John Joel followed him . They ended up in Parker 's mother 's bedroom . By the bed there was a big table , and Parker started to shuffle through folded newspapers and letters she had opened and stuffed back in their envelopes , looking for the picture . " Look , " Parker said , when he found it . " Come on . " John Joel followed Parker again , back to his room . Parker closed the door . He took tape and scissors out of his desk drawer and sat on the floor . " Watch , " he said . " What happens if your mother looks for that picture ? " " She does n't find it , " Parker said . " But Parker  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got something funny in the mail ? " " Fat chance . And even if it happened , all I 've got to do is deny it . What do you think they 're going to do to Inc ? " Parker was lifting the top corner of his mattress . Ile held it upp161and took out the fourth magazine from the top . It was Animal Antics , and with his eyes closed , Parker flipped it open to the picture of the monkey bending over to get the banana . The picture had been taken indoors ; the banana was on wall-to-wall carpeting . Parker shook his head , then carefully ripped the page out of the magazine . He put the magazine back under the mattress before he did anything else . Then he went back to the spot on the floor where John Joel sat , where the scissors and tape were , and cut Tiffy 's head out of the newspaper picture . He positioned it over the monkey 's face and taped it down , using little pieces of tape . John Joel had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an envelope , " Parker said . He opened his door and looked both ways again . He went into the hallway and opened a drawer in a table and took an envelope and a stamp out . Then he went back into his bedroom , closed the door , folded the ape picture twice and put it neatly in the envelope . He printed her name , in big letters , across the envelope . Then he went out into the hallway again , to look up her address in the phone book . When it was finished , he said , " Let 's go mail it . " " You 're gon na get in trouble , Parker , " John Joel said . " Stick around and I 'll show you something , " Parker said . Parker was taking another magazine out from under the mattress . It was a GI magazine , and he was tearing off the cover . A Marine , bayonet raised high , was yelling and beckoning troops forward , and behind him a soldier who had stepped on a land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Joel looked at the little soldier . He had a horrible expression on his face , and a blob of blood where his nose should be . John Joel studied the picture , as though the nose might be somewhere else . Then Parker cut out Louise 's face and put it over the face of the screaming Marine , her hair partly obscuring the helmet , and began to tear off small pieces of tape to fasten it in place . " What do you think I 'm going to do with that ? " he asked Parker . " It 's funny , " Parker said , laughing . " Imagine if your mother was a Marine . I should have used this one for Tiffy and the other one for your mother , maybe . This is nice of me , you know . This magazinecost me a buck and a half . " " I thought you told me you lifted it . "  | " Oh yeah ? " Parker said . " If I said so , then I did . I forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stupid old baldie who runs the candy store , you could take money out of his cash register and he would n't know it , I bet . " The gray and white newspaper picture fit in with the gray-green helmet and almost looked as if it belonged there . For some reason , it embarrassed him to look at the picture . " Here , " Parker said , pushing it toward him . " I do n't want the thing , " he said half-heartedly . " You do n't know what 's funny when you see it , " Parker said . " To tell you the truth , you probably would n't get half of what 's going on in Moonraker . It 's got a big snake in it , and you 're even afraid of old garden snakes . You 're even afraid of those Fourth of July snakes . " " I am not , " John Joel said . " Maybe when Tiffy 's husband sees it , he 'll squeal , " Parker said . " I 'm going out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you mail it later ? " " Come on , " Parker said . " When we come back , I 'll show you something . " " Why ca n't you show me now ? " Parker looked disgusted . He started picking things off the floor without saying anything . He put the magazine back under the mattress , and put the tape and scissors in his desk drawer . When he turned around , he did n't look as disgusted . " Okay , " Parker said . " Are you going to tell everybody in the world I showed you this ? " " What for ? " John Joel shrugged . " Because you could n't wait to tell your mother that I burned the ticket stubs , and she told my mother . " " She did not . You just told me this morning on the phone that you told her , and that she did n't believe you , and that she would n't give me the three bucks back . " Parker smiled . " I was just testing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , did n't you ? " " What 's it to you ? She did n't tell your mother . She would n't . " " That illustrates what I was telling you before . That illustrateswhy Tiffy is n't going to tell my mother what she got in the mail , and if she does , my mother 's not going to put two and twop163together . Your mother knows about the diaphragm , does n't she , she even knows , and she 's not telling my mother . " " She does n't like your mother . " " She does n't like my mother because my mother 's a tennis pro , just about , and nobody but Marge Pendergast can keep up with her . " " Talk about who loves their mother . " " I do n't love her . I just said that she plays pro tennis . " " You love her , " John Joel said . " Get off , " Parker said , brushing something imaginary from his arm . He went to the door , opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mouth shut about this , " he said . " What 's this going to be ? " John Joel said . " Scared ? " Parker said . " What would I be scared of ? " John Joel said . Actually , he was a little scared . He thought the way Parker looked both ways before he came out of his room and crept around the empty house was scary  --  it was the way people moved in the old movies , when somebody really was hiding and was about to jump out at them . The house was like an old-movie house , too : There were big overstuffed chairs , and there was almostnothing modern around . It had been Parker 's grandmother 's house , and when she died , Parker 's family had moved in . " This is probably going to be nothing , " John Joel said . " Oh no , Mr. Bill , do n't go down those steps ! " Parker squealed . As they went down , Parker was making sounds of explosions : " Pshew ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a hum from the sump pump behind the stairs that kept the basement from flooding . It was a creepy basement , full of things that looked like worms but were n't . Nothing was down there but a washer and dryer and Parker 's father 's workroom . He followed Parker into that room . Above the work table there was a picture of Parker 's grandmother and grandfather , standing beside some hollyhocks . Both of them had on straw hats  --  hers was wide-brimmed , and part of a hollyhockhad been tucked in the band  --  and they were holding hands and smiling into the camera . The picture was probably from long ago ; it was probably taken before Parker was born . There was ap164picture of three men in Army uniforms , with beer mugs raised  --  a picture all brown and white , with spots here and there on the picture , like little match flames . And there was a picture of Parker as a baby , sitting in his diapers , holding a toy rabbit . Parker was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . " One of those guys is the guy who only had one ball , " Parker said , pointing to the picture of the three men in uniform . " This one of them married somebody who 's a famous dancer , and the one with one ball runs a bar in Santo Domingo , and that one 's my father . " There was a chain dangling from a fluorescent light above the table . Parker pulled the light on . It blinked a couple of times , and then the table was flooded with bright light . Parker pushed aside a hammer and a jar full of nails and screws and lifted two fishing tackle boxes from below the table onto the tabletop . He opened one and put aside several carefully folded wide ties with geometric patterns on them . Underneath the ties there was a pen that , when tilted , showed a tiny woman becoming naked . " I 've seen those , " John Joel said . " Seen this ? " Parker said . He turned the pen slowly , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking out began to come toward the small naked woman , slowly and imprecisely , like someone floating in space when there 's no gravity . The penis touched the woman 's side . Parker smiled and put the pen back in the box . " Look at this , " Parker said . He held out a little dish , or an ashtray , with a drawing on it of a huge woman , being sculpted out of stone by a man who was carving with his penis . " This is what I really wanted to show you , " Parker said . He put the things back and opened the other box . In that box there were more ties , some letters and a small black gun . Parker took them out , put them aside , and took out a cardboard box . Inside there was a piece of cardboard that unfolded into the shape of a penis , a narrow black scarf with tiny mothholes in it ( Parker held it over his eyes for a second ) , and a folded piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three feet high . " Better than pin the tail on the donkey , " Parker said . Parker chuckled . He zoomed the cardboard penis against the vagina . " It 's not his stuff , " Parker said . " It 's my grandfather 's . " Parker began refolding the piece of paper . " He 's never going to tell me this stuff is here ,  |p165I  bet , " Parker said . He put the two boxes back under the table and pushed the hammer and the jar of screws back into place . " He goes into the boxes . I wet a hair and put it up against that box , " Parker said , pulling the chain to turn the light off . " And the hair was gone . " " How do you know that when your spit dried , the hair did n't fall off ? " " Because I did it three times , " Parker said . He turned around and showed his teeth , like Jaws . Walking behind him , John Joel saw Parker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding the imaginary cable that his teeth would snap . Parker 's head fell forward and snapped straight . John Joel kept walking . " Well , " John Joel said , " I 've got to get home , I guess . " " What for ? " Parker said . " Because my mother 's working today and she told me to take the chicken out of the freezer at two o'clock . " " All you 've got to do is say you forgot . " " Nab , " John Joel said . " I guess I 'll go do it . You want to come over ? " " There 's nothing to do at your house . " " What are you going to do here ? " " Read my magazines . I got a new one I have n't read yet . It 's called Tons of Fun . About fatsos . " " You 've started laughing at yourself ? " John Joel said . " I laugh at myself , " Parker said . " If I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to look this way . It drives my father crazy . " " My father , too . " " So ? " Parker said . " Then it 's worth it . " " I do n't have to be fat either , " John Joel said . He had never really thought of that before . " Want to see Tons of Fun ? " " Nab . I 've got to go . " " Why does n't your sister take the chicken out ? " " Because she 's always over at Angela 's . " " So call her and make her go home and do it . " " She would n't . " " She 's a douchebag , " Parker said . " A what ? " " Get out of here , " Parker said . Parker flopped on his bed.  | " What 's a douchebag ? " Parker said . " Get out of here . " He started to laugh . " Are we going into New York later on , or what ? " " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that box of graham crackers on the floor where you 're standing . " John Joel picked up the box and threw it to Parker , meaning to hit him . The box hit the side of the bed and fell to the floor . " I could fix your sister , " Parker said . " Your sister really needs fixing . " Walking home , John Joel remembered the time when Parker had had poison ivy , the way it had gotten in his ears , the way the swelling had nearly closed his eyes , the sores that were partly insideand partly outside his nostrils ; and how he had gone up the stairs , talking to Parker 's mother , and how she had opened the door and there was Parker in the bed , painted with some white stuff that almost covered his body , lying there just staring into the room , though there were only slits where his eyes should be . He was holding a glass of lemonade that Parker 's mother had given him . Parker had not said hello . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was naked . John Joel had stood there and wondered if what he was seeing on the bed was some huge swollen mummy of Parker , if Parker had n't really disappeared , and this was what was left . He had been afraid to get too close to him . He had tried to get Parker to say something , but he would n't . The whiteness of Parker , the way he had looked on the bed , was like those plaster people at the museum ; and thinking about the museumreminded him that Parker had gotten his way : Parker had seen the show and done him out of being reimbursed . Parker was n't really his friend , and he had always known that . He had been surprised , himself , that when Parker called he had been happy . He had been even more surprised that he had gone over there , and that he had stayed so long . Sometimes he thought that Parker could read his mind . That was part of the reason he had gone : Because whatever he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really thinking . He would have known that he was glad to hear from him . He would have known , the way he had known that he had told his mother about Parker burning the ticket stubs.  |p167He  was thinking about Parker 's poison ivy , and he decided not to risk cutting through the lot that separated Angela 's house from his house , even if he was careful to avoid the shiny-leafed vines that wound through the lot . It was better to walk the long way , and be safe . Parker knew that he was afraid of firecrackers and snakes . Parker knew what everything sexual meant , and Parker had stopped telling him . For a long while , he had been able to ask , and after an eye roll or a shrug , Parker would tell him ; but now Parker was learning more and more and he would n't say anything . And that day he had gone berry-picking with Tiffy and his mother . He was sure that he was right about the way he felt : that if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic ; that they would n't have just sat there awkwardly ; that the only laugh would n't have been about the bird that crapped on the cloth . His mother and Tiff y were like one person , in a way , and he was an extra . He felt the same way about his father and Nick  --  that they were n't really talking the way they would talk if he were n't there . When he was alone with his father they talked , but he alwaysp168said the wrong thing , even about small things , even about Nick 's girlfriend . He was thinking about his father saying , " Not your type , huh ? " He could n't imagine being part of his father 's and Nick 's world , even when he grew up . He could n't imagine having a good friend when he grew up . He thought that Parker would still be around , and that Parker would always know more than he did , that he would always take risks and not care ; and that he would always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker 's bedroomdoorway , trying to get Parker to say something and Parker not talking . He had talked , finally . He had made a joke that was n't really a joke . He had said , " Come over here . I want you to get poison ivy . " Then he had laughed , the way his father had laughed on the train when he said , " Not your type , huh ? " Both of them were sad laughs : Parker 's because for once he could n't impose his will ; his father 's because when they talked , no matter what either of them thought about how pretty Nick 's girl was , and no matter that the rocking train threw them into each other time and again , they were still worlds apart.  |p169NINA  WAS almost exhausted , and things were starting to get too crazy . She thought that when Horton left things would calm down , but Jonathan and Spangle had almost been on a rampage since he left . She could hardly imagine Horton being a stabilizing influence on anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had been outdone . Of course , when Horton was there a couple of hours ago , nobody was as stoned as they were now . She wished that she had had less to smoke , or at least that she did not have to go to work the next day . She knew she was going to be standing there for hours , with her head hurting and her eyes not functioning right , having flashes of this night . It was hot , even with the window open . The window was really open  --  he had tried to fix the screen and had pushed it out , onto the sidewalk . Thank God nobody had been walking underneath . All of them knew better than to make an appearance outside , even to do something as simple as retrieve a fallen window screen . The game now was pin the tail on the donkey , but instead of a tail there was her green bathtowel , and instead of a donkey therep170was a yelping , stoned person who thought he was playing another game , insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuedas a donkey . At least , that 's what it seemed like . No one was communicating terribly well . " Charades ! " Spangle screamed , and she groaned and rolled over on the rug . She could n't believe that just a few hours ago  --  no , probablymany hours , more hours than she wanted to count up , becausethen she would know how late at night it was  --  the two of them had come in and taken over again , as though it were old times , simply old times , and here they were . " It ca n't speak for itself , " he said , pointing to the towel on the rug beside Nina , " but it 's doing its imitation and it 's a book . The fucking towel is a book . And it was n't easy to spread it out flat on the floor , so everybody had better try to guess . What 's that towel on the floor ? Name of a book . " Jonathan kicked the towel and almost tripped on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hollered , and Nina said , " Sssh . " " Okay , " he said , straightening the towel . " Towel on the floor , name of a book . Okay . What am I ? " " What are you , or what 's the towel ? " she said . " What 's the towel . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm concentrating , " he said , wandering into the kitchen . " Four words . No , five . Five words , a charade of what that towel on the rug is impersonating . Not hard to guess . Running out of Coke . " " Go home , " she said . " I 've got to work . " " That 's six words , " he said . " What ? " she said . " Did you close the refrigerator door ? " She hoped so . She did n't hear it creak closed , and she did n't see how she could get up right away to close it . " I 'm completely fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsing on the sofa . " If I was on an airplane , they would n't serve me . They saw me trying to get on a plane like this , they would n't let me on . You ca n't get on an airplane when you 're in this kind of shape . They 'll leave you on the ground forever . " " Metaphor for your life , " Jonathan said , coming out of the bathroom . His jeans were much too big for him , and he 'd real/room , he 'd stuffed a washcloth in the waistband . He had n't put the washcloth in very well . It was wadded up and stuffed in like a lumpy baseball . " What did you say ? " he said . Jonathan went into a coughing fit . " I said it 's too hot in here , " he said . " We 've got to leave the country , " he said to Nina . " It 's too hot . " " That 's not the answer , " she said . " Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the answer . " " We 're in the middle of a game . What do you mean ? See that towel on the floor ? You know what it reminds me of ? " " What ? " Jonathan said . " The answer is How Green Was My Valley . " He put his arm over his eyes , as if he 'd been struck blind by the sun . " I gave it away , " he said . " Fuck me , I gave it away . " " What 's he talking about ? " Jonathan said . He pulled the white washcloth out of the waist of his jeans and threw it on top of the green towel . " One 's short and the other one 's tall , but they 're the same kind , " he said . " They 'll get it on . Lots of pale-green hand-towels . " " How come you two are still here ? " Nina said . " What ? " he said . " I 'm not still here . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Can you close it ? " she said to Jonathan . " I can do anything , " he said . He went back into the bathroom and closed the door . She smelled it again : grass . He was smoking more grass . " No , " she said . She thought she said . Nobody said anything . " I never read How Green Was My Valley . You read that , huh ? You read that at Bard College ? " " We would n't read crap like that at Bard . " " Not at Bard , " he said , frowning down at her . " Where are we again ? " " Columbus Avenue . " " Columbus did n't discover America , " he said . " I 'm fucked . I 'm fucked . I smoked grass last week and it calmed me down . If I went out it would be all over . Stop telling us to leave . " " I have n't said that for an hour . "  | " You 've come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you wo n't leave . " " If I tried to get on a plane in this condition , you know what they 'd do ? They would n't let me get on . I would be denied boarding . I could n't even get a denied boarding pass , because if the plane was there and I was the one who was fucked , it would n't even be their fault . They can crash DC-io 's , and that 's their fault , but if you have one puff too many , they keep you on the ground . " " We missed the plane . Who cares . We missed the plane , " Jonathan said . " Then we got another one . " " This idiot would have brought drugs through customs . You know what you get for being busted in Spain ? Seven years and seven days . Longer than it took God to create the world . " " Somebody close the refrigerator door , " she said . " Does anybody object if I take a shower ? " Jonathan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I be enough at home that I can just take a shower ? " He was undressing . He left his T-shirt and jeans by the towel in the living room and walked  --  stumbled  --  into the bathroom in his Jockey shorts . He did n't close the door . He relit the joint he 'd left in the soap dish and started humming . " Turn the water on , " she said . Thought she said . " He 's taking a shower , " Spangle said . " I can close the refrigerator door , I just do n't want to . The truth is I do n't fucking want to . " " Shut up , " Jonathan called from the bathroom . " I can hear you in here . " " Bring it out , you grass-hog , " he said . " If you come out and do n't see your shadow , you can go back in with it . " " How am I going to see my shadow out here ? " Jonathan said , stumbling out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't see your shadow in the dark . Never mind shadows , there might be people all over , and you ca n't see them in the dark . " " Mind games , " he said . " You know who 's here . " " I 'm going to close the refrigerator , " Jonathan said . He got the towel from the floor and headed toward the bathroom . He left the towel there and came back into the room , jumped over Nina leapfrog style and went into the kitchen and closed the refrigerator door.  | " Let 's send out for a pizza , " Jonathan said . " I do n't want to eat , " Nina said . " I do n't want to argue about what goes on the pizza , " Spangle said . " Who said we had to argue ? Extra cheese and mushrooms , " Jonathan said . " So send out for a pizza . We can hang it on the wall and use it as a dartboard . " " It would drip down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock , " he said . " You could have an originalwork of art on your wall , Nina . Let 's fix Nina 's wall . " " What does it cost to send out for a pizza ? " Jonathan said . He looked over his shoulder . " Excuse me , " he said . He went into the bathroom and closed the door . Nina heard the water running . " Here 's a riddle . See if you know this one , " he said . " Why did the little moron throw the clock out the window ? " " He tripped . There was n't any screen in the window . The clock fell on Columbus Avenue . " " Fuck you . Come on , Nina . Why did he ? " " That 's such an old joke . I ca n't believe you 're telling me such an old joke . I ca n't believe you 're here . Will you round up Jonathanand please go home ? " " I ca n't believe you 're here . New York chic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumpy apartment on Columbus Avenue . " " It was n't a riddle , it was a joke . Different thing . Pardon me . Let me go into the kitchen and see if he closed the refrigerator door . " Spangle got up and felt his way along the wall into the kitchen . " He closed it , " he called . Then everything was silent , except for the water slapping down in the tub . The showerhead was broken and had to be tilted a certain way to make the water spray out instead of pouring out of the spigot . Jonathan did n't know that . Shc thought about going in and telling him , but she could n't move . " Here , " he said , holding out a joint to her . It was wrapped in blue paper , and she had no idea where it had come from .  --  That 's a pencil , " she said , taking it . " I know it . Write down inv number so you can call me . It'sp174unlisted . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me , you wo n't be able to . Write this down . " " What am I supposed to write on ? The rug ? " " I do n't know where there 's any paper . We both closed the refrigerator door . You could get up and find the paper . " " Call me and tell me your number , " she said , dropping the pencil . " Maybe we should order a pizza , " he said . " Is there somebody who delivers ? " " There 's a book by the phone . Look under pizza ' in the book . " " You could write my number in the book , then , " he said . He walked over to the phone . She thought , watching , that he looked like a person standing upright and swimming . It was dark in the room , but things had bright edges , because of light from the sign across the street . " I 'm writing in the book , " he said . " I 'm writing you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed her eyes . New York working girl . " Pina colada , " he said . " Will they bring a pizza with onions and meatballs and a pitcher of pina coladas ? " " The pizza man brings his dog . It 's a corgi . It 's named Bess . " " Is that the truth ? " he said . " One time he brought it , one time he did n't . I do n't like pizza . I never eat pizza . " " New lover 's got a lot of money , huh ? " " What did you do with all your money ? " " I spent it . If you have money , you can buy things . I bought some things . My possessions all linked arms and disappeared over the hill . " " Be serious . " " I am . I want to order a pizza before he gets out of the shower . There 's nothing in the book under pizza . ' " " Give it to me , " she said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down beside her and blew into her hair , to watch it separate . " What 's this ? " she said , pointing to the word " pizza . " " Tell him to bring pina coladas , too , " he said . " I 'm going to have a drink . Do you want a drink ? "  |p175There  was about an inch of vodka left in the bottle . He swirled the vodka , shook it , stared at it and put the bottle down . " Does anybody have any money ? " she said . " The plan is , " he said , " we call him and order the pizza . When he comes we overpower him and kidnap the corgi , and if he wants it back , we say that he has to leave the pizza and find a pitcher of pina coladas . " " So he leaves and finds the cops . " " So we throw the corgi out the window . " " Were you two drunk before you got here ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in surrender . " I swear to you . We have a high tolerance level . That grass is a wipeout . Moves your brain cells around like a tidal wave . Little deuce coupe . " What ? " " The Beach Boys singing Saturday Night Fever music , " he said . " Double whew . " " The Bee Gees , " she said , closing the book and dropping it on the rug . " Bee Gees . Sure . What a relief . Thank God , " Spangle said . He sprawled on his stomach next to her . " You think somebody who came in here would think I was Tab Hunter and you were Sandra Dee ? " " Let 's see if he guesses when he comes out of the bathroom . " " What 's he doing ? He 's taking a shower ? I thought he was going to call for a pizza . " " Forget it . I do n't want anybody up here . " " You 're unsociable . Even avoid all your old friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pina colada . " " Really , " she said , " really , it 's true , I have to work tomorrow . " " Tell ' em they do n't have to buy stockings if they do n't have any legs . Tell ' em all they 've got to do is head for some subway platform and wait for a loony to push them under and their stocking problems are solved . " " They reattach everything . " " Surgeons ? They do n't drink . They 've got to be sober men . Bite my mouth : Surgeons are women , too , right ? Women  --  what do von call them ? "  |p176She  could hear him breathing . The water . A sound that might have been Jonathan , breathing louder than the water was falling . She shook her head in confusion . Had he just asked what you called women ? " Microsurgeons ! " he said . " I thought of it ! It 's microsurgeons . Women microsurgeons reattaching legs  --  they call them limbs , right ? Microsurgeon attaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stands there and pushes and splat ! Lady microsurgeon to the rescue . " She thought he was funny . She could n't stop laughing , and she was too weak to laugh ; she was trying to pay attention to something , but when she was laughing she could n't think what . " Go in the bathroom , " she said . " See what that sound is . " The sound was the hair dryer Jonathan had turned on for some reason as he got into the shower . It was blowing a blast of air into the shower . He had the shower curtain back so he could feel it , and he was smoking a joint with no hands , letting the water pelt his back . The hair dryer lay on its side on top of the toilet . " That 's what it was , " she said , when he came back and collapsedbeside her again . " I told you I heard something . " " Maybe some street vendor will come by and holler and we can get a pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 're so wrecked . We could all take a shower and not dry off , and if we seemed odd , we could tell the guy with the corgi that a tidal wave hit us . The Beach Boys . The fucking Brian Wilson Beach Boys . " " Do n't you have to work tomorrow ? " she said . " No , " he said . " What about Jonathan ? " " No . Nobody has to work tomorrow . You do n't have to work tomorrow . Call and tell them the work went away  --  you tried to catch it , but it got away . " " When I was a little girl , I wanted to be a dancer , " she said . " That 's totally off the subject , " he said . He blew gently into her hair and watched a strand lift up and fall back in the same place . " I could n't get it up to save my life , " he said . Jonathan came into the room , dripping wet and naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bananas . " Jonathan shook hisp177head , went back into the bathroom and closed the door . She heard the roar of the hair dryer again . Spangle picked up the phone and , without dialing , cupped his hand and said , " Yes , that 's right : large pizza with anchovies and lasagna on top and a pitcher of pings to travel . Thank you . " " He 's fucked , " Jonathan said , coming out of the bathroom with his too-big jeans falling down his hips , one toe cut  --  no , wait : big joke  --  one toe with polish on the nail . It was n't dry , and when he stumbled , it smeared on the wood floor . " What 's he doing ? " Jonathansaid . " I have to work tomorrow , " she said . " You ca n't , " Jonathan said . " Do n't be ridiculous . " " You left the hair dryer on , " she said . " Refrigerator door , dryer , next you 'll nag me to make my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even live here . I 've got to shove off . Is he okay ? " " I do n't think I 'm okay , " she said . " I ca n't drink and smoke . Why did I drink vodka if I was going to smoke ? " " Call that guy at the radio station . Have him figure the situation out and send you a free T-shirt . " " I 'm not calling anybody , " she said . " I think somebody is playing Smokey Robinson and the Miracles , " Jonathan said . " God damn . I 've been thinking about them for a week . " " Make Smokey sing Special Occasion , ' " he hollered out the window , yelling in Jonathan 's ear . Jonathan grabbed him and pulled him back in . " And make him dance when he sings it ! No fudging on the high notes ! " he screamed . His voice cracked . He started coughing , and when Jonathan hit him on the back he fell over . Jonathan started laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castorp , go up to the mountain , " he said , coming out of the coughing fit first . Jonathan stood , helping himself up by pullingon the window ledge . He looked down at the street , swaying . The man with the radio had gone away . A man and a woman were standing there , looking up at the window . " Somebody has tuberculosis , " Jonathan said to the two people on the sidewalk . Ile did n't want to yell , but he spoke too quietly.  |p178He  was just leaning forward , water running off his hair , whisperingto the couple on Columbus Avenue . " I 've got to go . I 've got a date , " Jonathan said . " You 're lying . You do n't have a date . " " I 've got to get out of here , " Jonathan said . " If I come back , I 'll bring a pizza . Green pepper and pepperoni . " " Go ahead , " he said . " If you 're going , go ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get tuberculosis going out there like that . " " Oh Christ  --  how am I going to go to school tomorrow ? " Nina said . She got up on one elbow , and tried to blink the room straight . Blinking made it tilt left and right . She said : " Why did I say that ? School instead of work ? " " She 's got TB and she 's hallucinating , " Spangle said . " Do you think she needs the shower cure ? " " There is n't any more shower . " " What are you talking about ? " " I turned it off , " Jonathan said , and bent forward , sliding his hands down his thighs to his knees , laughing . " Fooled you good , " he said . " Oh fuck , " Nina said . " I 'm really going to be mad if I throw up . " " Lie still , " Jonathan said . " I 'll get you a washcloth . " " I do n't want a washcloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her a washcloth , with very little water squeezed out of it . She moved it from her mouth , where he had put it , up to her forehead . Then she was both cold and dizzy . " I 've got to go , " Jonathan said . " Do n't anybody say anything funny , so I can get it together to go . " He put out his hand and took Nina 's . She did n't shake it . She just rested her hand in his . " No offense taken , " he said . " We are wrecked . " He put on the rest of his clothes , talking to himself , telling himself to button buttons , roll up sleeves . " Admit you do n't have a date , " Spangle said to Jonathan . " I do n't have a date , " Jonathan said . " I 've got to go . " Nobody stopped him . When he left , Nina said , " Can you shut the door ? " " That door ? " Spangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , " she said.  | " I can shut that door . Sure , " he said . He walked to the door and slammed it , then put his back against it and looked at her . He squinted and moved closer , to see where she was cut . Not blood on the floor by her ear . Good . Something else . " Hey , Nina , " he said , " I have n't seen you for so long . How are you ? I mean , how were you before you got wrecked ? " " I do n't remember , " she said . " You do remember . Come on . " " I do n't know , " she said . " Am I going to lose my job ? " " You 're not going to lose your job . There 's always another job . " " What does that mean ? That I 'm going to lose it ? " " Only if you show up , " he said . He stretched out beside her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I overdid this . " " Where did he go ? " she said , looking at the closed door . " He probably had a date . He has dates at funny hours . I don'tknow anybody besides him who 'd begin a date at eleven o'clock . " " He said he did n't . " " You ca n't tell with him , " he said . " Well , what time is it ? " " What time is it ? It is . . . this time ? " He held his wrist toward her , but she could n't see the numerals on the watch . She saw one hand , sweeping , and a lot of little circles and designs . " Tell me what time it is , " she said . He told her that it was ten of three in the morning . " I have to go to sleep , " she said . " I 'll lose my job . " " I 'd tell you a bedtime story , but I 'm too wrecked . I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep and turned into a pod . " " Do n't , " she said . " I 'll have nightmares . That horrible movie . Somebody was just saying something about that that gave me nightmares . " " In the morning , " he said , " tell me how you are . Were . " " Why did I ever do this ? " she said . " It 's our fault . Wicked stuff . I hope he took it with him . Wait a minute : If he 's responsible , I hope he took it with him . How was he when lie left ? " " He looks so much younger with his hair cut , " she said . " He 's such a ladykillcr , " he said . " Ile probably did have a date.  |p180I  'm too old to have dates . I just look up old friends . " He patted her hand . " You live with somebody , " she said . She fell asleep and woke up when he began talking to himself in his sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped talking . When she woke up the next time , she could see his watch . There was a horrible ache over her left eye , and her mouth was dry , but with one eye closed she could see the watch , and she could stand up and go into the bathroom . She wanted to splash water on her face , but she was afraid that touching her face that way might spread the pain . She tilted two aspirin out of the bottle in the medicine cabinet and swallowed them , washing them down with a handful of water . She took off her clothes , put them over the towel rack , and got into the shower . She adjusted the showerhead and ran the water , stepped into it when it was the right temperature . She was sore all over from sleeping on the floor . She had no idea how she had bruised her thigh so badly . She took a quick shower , decided at the last minute to bob her head under the water , and when she saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and massaged the top of her head . She closed her eyes and let the water beat on her head until she thought the soap was all washed away . Then she got out , stepped onto the floor full of puddles , and stood in water , rather than on the soppingwet bathrug . She dried off , patting her body instead of rubbingit . The phone rang , but she decided just to let it ring . That , or he could answer it . She turned on the hair dryer , but something was wrong with it : It hardly put out any heat . She patted her hair and wrapped a towel around herself and walked out of the bathroom . He was still asleep . He had n't even heard the phone . No : He was smiling at her ; awake , but still wiped out . " Good morning , " she said , on her way into the bedroom . She dropped the towel on the bed and got a robe out of the closet . It was John 's robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her , found in an antique clothing store in the Village , a satin robe with a lunging lion on the back and a rising sun above the pocket on the front , the name Neil P. stitched in script above the blood-red sun . " I feel like I 'm going to live , " she said , holding the robe closedp181and going out to the living room and standing over him . She tied the sash and rubbed her face and sat down beside him . " Last night was an exception , right ? " she said . " You 're really not into dope that way anymore , right ? " " Never , " he said . " Do you want an aspirin ? " she said . " I 'm okay , " he said . " What time is it ? " She picked up his wrist and looked , and told him it was five of seven . He groaned . " Do n't tell me you 're going to work , " he said . " Stay here and sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pick up a little . " " Whew , " he said . " In Nina 's apartment on Columbus Avenue . " " You were putting me down good last night , " she said . " Callingme the New York working girl . " " I hope you did n't pay attention to me . " " I did n't . " " I wonder where Jonathan is , " he said . He got up , slowly , and went to the window . " Leave your window open here and no bugs get in , " he said , shaking his head . " That 's amazing . " She went back into the bathroom , to brush her teeth . She closed the door and bent over the sink , and realized that the aspirin had already started to work ; the blinding pain was disappearing from above her eye . Her eyes were bloodshot . She was going to have to wear dark glasses . " Nobody came in through the window , " he said , outside the bathroom door . " Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " There 's somebody at my door ? " she said , opening the bathroom door . She came out of the bathroom , and went to the door . She forgot to ask who it was . The chain was n't on , because neither of them had remembered to put it on when Jonathan left . In fact , she opened the door certain that it would be Jonathan . John was standing there , and even before he realized that a man was standing beside her , he looked terrible . It was the first time he had ever come to the apartment in the morning . He walked in without saying anything , and then just stood there , looking from Nina to Peter Spangle.  |p182He  walked up the stairs , trying to remember that he was in love . There was a fact , and an important one : He was in love . He was there because she said more in a glance than anyone else said in a touch , and a touch from her meant more than an embrace from anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go be with the person you loved . Only , he did n't know where to begin . What he had to talk about seemed to have nothing to do with the world of love and everything to do with the world of hate , and that world had never been real when he was with Nina . If she was getting away , it was because he was letting her get away . She was inside the apartment . He knew that she would not have left for work yet . She would be having her little-girl breakfast of cereal and fruit , and brushing her hair , listening to the news on the radio , tidying up the room . She was n't mean in the morning . You could talk to her and she 'd answer . The two times they had gone away together , he had been amazed at how cheerful she was in the morning . He tried to remember that it was morning now , that if he put his mind to it , he could stop his legs from shaking enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he could reach outp183and touch her and she would be there . He felt as crazy and foolish as an old drunk who finds his way home but ca n't remember to climb the stairs , so he 's found in the morning and catches hell anyway . God  --  if he was really comical . If she meant that , really , and did n't just say it to tease , because she was fond of him . If it was all explained in Passages : a simple answer . Nothing was simple . Not even loving Nina was simple . This was the only place he could imagine being , and already he felt that the place was n't there , that he was n't going to make it to the top of the stairs , and that if he did , he would n't know where to begin . He would have to invent some logical explanation for what he was going to tell her , or maybe it was just because he was in a panic that he thought that . He realized that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , returned enough breath to him , that he was able to continuewalking up the stairs . He could n't believe what he had left behind , what he had just walked out on . He had thought at the time that he was doing the logical thing , that he was doing something out of self-preservation . There had been so much chaos : He had been afraid that he was losing his senses , going deaf . And only the summer before , the six of them , his mother , Brandt , John Joel , Louise , Mary and he , had been at the carnival . Brandt  --  as usual  --  hanging on to his arm and trying to bring him to the ground , dangling and swaying . They had been a family at a carnival . He had been awake all night , and he could n't think straight . He knew that he would have to get to the point and not edge up toward it ; that he could n't talk to her about the summer before , the things they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trying to explain to her that they were typical ; that maybe even his love for her figured in a pattern ; that they were typical and then suddenly they were n't . He was going to say to her : I want you to help me . He did n't know what help he needed . He had no memory of how he had gotten from Connecticut to New York . He did remember being in the city , and taking the car to the garage he usually went to , the keys left behind , the cab to Nina 's . The cab driver had talked to him about the weather they were supposed to have over the weekend , and he had remembered , only then , what day it was . IIe had just stuffed wadded bills into the cab driver 's hand because he could n't think  --  he might as wellp184have been a man in a foreign country where he did n't understand the currency . Better just to overpay and run , to be embarrassed that way rather than the other . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least be breathing normally when she saw him . More than anything he wanted to see her standing there . He wanted no harm to have come to her , at least . At the top of the stairs he made a fist and knocked . The reverberation that began in his hand shot through his arm and ended in his heart . And then she opened the door.  |p185SPANGLE  'S MOTHER was wondering if she should have her oldmouton coat updated , as she put it , for Cynthia to wear in the winter . Cynthia listened , keeping the phone clamped against her ear with her raised shoulder , carefully stroking clear nail lacquer on her fingernails as she talked . The smell was powerful so close to her nose , and she wished that she could put the brush down and sit comfortably in a chair and do her nails and not have to talk to Spangle 's mother . It was wrong to blame Spangle for his mother . It was even wrong to blame Spangle 's mother for trying to be nice , but it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces still bobbed before her in the empty apartment , and she did not think that she could be tactful much longer . " I suppose you do n't want it , even if I have the bottom part narrowed , " Spangle 's mother said . " I think the coat I have is fine . I appreciate your offering , but I do n't really think I 'd be comfortable in a fur coat . " " Do n't think I 'm dense . Do n't think I do n't know what you mean , " Spangle 's mother said , " but in terms of mental as opposedto physical comfort , think about how you would feel withp186some perfume squirted on and a strand of pearls and a thick , warm mouton . You could update the look yourself by dyeing your hair red and chopping it into one of those crew cuts and wearing neon pants and a cowboy shirt . Do n't think I do n't read fashion magazines anymore . I do . I read them , and I know that women want to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a party . Stiletto heels at work . Silver skirts . Really . " " I appreciate the offer , " Cynthia said . " It 's wicked to keep it hanging there in its little purple garment bag . I ca n't wear it because it reminds me of happier times . I wish I could just put that coat back on , and squirt on some Toujours Moi and fasten my pearl necklace and feel good , the way I did in the old days . My husband 's dead . Two sons , both in Madrid , and a biopsy that fortunately came out benign . Two sons crazy as loons . I put them in their little sleeper suits and read them bedtime stories , and they grew up handsome and smart and ended up with psychiatrists and amphetamine problems and they ran away , both of them , on my money , to Madrid . " She sighed . " Their father 's money . Whatever . " " I do n't want to take the coat because I 'm not sure that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be around or not , " Cynthia said . " This is n't my idea of living together this summer , that he disappears to Madrid and sends me one onesentencepost card . " " You 're mad , " Spangle 's mother said . " I 'm mad , too . It 's my money and your time . That gives us a common bond . The mouton would give us another one : I 'd give a fine present , and you 'd be indebted . If the next lump is malignant , I could count on a visit from you . " " That 's a horrible thing to say . You know I 'd come to see you . " " I think that when called upon , most people fish out a travel brochure . " " You insisted that he go to Madrid . " " Oh no . You 're mistaken there . I insisted that he track down his flesh-and-blood brother to bring him back to this country . He has a responsibility to his brother . His brother has followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniff nutmeg , he sniffed nutmeg . I 'm not exaggerating . All of a sudden the Hardy Boys books had a dusting of nutmeg over them . "  | " Then grass and drugs , " Cynthia said , finishing the sentence for her . " Sports cars , grass and drugs . My God : I used to measure out little spoonfuls of medicine and wobble forward to their littlebabymouths with them , and I cut aspirin in quarters , and they grew up and jumped into a sports car and threw away their money on houses they never wanted and women they hardly knew and drugs  --  they 'd try anything . My God : He told me he wanted to go to Bard College because it was a small place  --  it was so pretty there , and he would n't just disappear in the system . Bard College . " " I 'm sorry , " Cynthia said , " but I 'm very tired . I want to hang up and do some things before I have to go to bed . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What must you think about a woman who grew up getting another pearl for her necklaceevery Christmas and birthday ? I was so embarrassed that the chain filled up so slowly with pearls . I do n't know where I put that thing . " Cynthia hung up , being careful not to touch the phone with her nails . She was becoming less and less sure that if he came back from Madrid she would even want to see him . Might as well give up on him and do something else . Screw Mary Knapp 's father , who acted at lunch as though he wanted to screw her . But she was starting to dislike men . She was starting to get very tired of all the hassles they caused , the way they just put themselves in front of you , and suddenly you had a barrier to run around . They were stronger ; they did have a different kind of energy . Spangle did n't have any money , and he 'd managed a trip to Spain , while she was teaching five days a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was either funny or pointless . When they were vocal , it was always the boys . And the goddamnmagician , that completely crazy , boring , stupid magician who hounded her . If the police were n't men , she would call the police and try to get them to keep him away from her . She went to the window and looked out . A fat woman was walking a cat on a leash . A man was walking a few paces in front of her , smoking a cigar . She tried to figure out if they were together . A teenage boy in a light-blue leisure suit ran down the street , and the man with the cigar turned to look . Cynthia saw that what she had taken for a man was really a woman  --  a tall , heavy woman smoking a cigar  |p188The  woman with the cigar waited . The woman with the cat caught up with her . They walked down the street together . The magician was nowhere to be seen , but if she went out he would be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic , and a couple of nights ago he had switched the topic to health insurance : Everyoneshould demand national health insurance . He had asked her to have a donut and coffee with him , and she had refused . She had even told him to leave her alone , that she was going to tell her husband that he was bothering her . That did n't stop him , because obviously her husband was n't there . She went into the kitchen and turned on the useless fan . The idea of Spangle as a husband amused her . Once , she had wanted that : Spangle , off stoned in Madrid , who probably thought that he was going to come back and worm his way into her heart again . On the shelf above the sink was a bottle of tequila with a worm in the bottom . She thought that it would be nice to pickle her students : to have rows of canningjars , with little shrunken students inside . She wondered if the magician could help her with that plan . Because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . If she stepped out he would be there  --  it would be as simple as holding out a sugar cube to a horse , a pole to a sinking person . If she went out , the magician would come for her . She drank some Kahlua and felt sorry for herself . She put an ice cube in the glass and drank some more , tilting the glass and knocking the ice cube against the side . She curled up in a chair in the living room and wrote her sister a letter , an ugly letter that accused her of selling out for money . She asked her sister if she would like a newly tailored mouton coat . There was no danger in writing her sister such a letter , because unless a carrier pigeon came for it , there would be no way to get it to her . There would be no way , because the mailbox was on the street and so was the magician . If she really thought that it would be as simple as her going out and his snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnet , she would call the police and let it all happen . But she realized that if she called them , either they would come and the magician would see them and not approach her , or else , inexplicably , he would not be there . Then she , herself , would be perceived as yet another New Haven nut . She reread thep189letter . It was coherent and true , and if she had the nerve , she would mail it . She had to agree with Spangle 's mother that it was awful to see people throwing their lives away , and her sister was being very one-minded about dedicating herself to a rich , eccentricold man . Cynthia went into the kitchen and poured the last of the Kahlua into the glass . The first drink was all right , but the second and third were candy-sweet . She thought about calling Mary Knapp 's father and asking him to come over with a bottle of gin and a bottle of tonic . He would . She thought he would . She thought that Spangle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stayed with her , not the other way around  --  only to take off , stay away . He could be anywhere , doing anything . And she had to get calls about mouton coats . If she picked up the phone  --  which was ringing  --  and it was Tess Spangle again , she was just going to hang up . It was someone named Bobby , whom she did n't know , who said he was an old friend of Spangle 's from the Cambridge and Vermont days and wanted to know if Spangle wanted to come to a party at a waterfall in New Hampshire . She told him that Spangle was in Madrid . He told her that he was going to be going to Africa in September . After they had finished talking , he said : " I have n't called the wrong number , have I ? I really wanted to get in touch with Spangle . I have n't seen him since 1972 . Last week I called a wrong number  --  a restaurant , to make a reservation  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never reached the goddamn place . I went to the restaurant and we could n't eat dinner . My girlfriend was with me , " he said . " We 're going to Africa together . " She hung up and sat in the chair . From the apartment next door , she could hear music . It was a group of people singing " I 'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy . " The people next door had come over once , the first week she stayed in the apartment , early in the morning , to see if she had any goat 's milk she could spare . " Oh man , I really did n't think so , but the things you least expect can happen sometimes , " the man had said . The woman with him had just said , " ' Thank you anyway . " She never talked much , Cynthia found out  --  in fact , the first time she knocked on the door , wanting Cynthia to play Go with her , she had just smiled and held out thep190box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee Doodle Dandy , " and were singing along with it . There seemed to be lots of people singing . There was a noise that sounded like a chair crashing . The record played on , but the people stopped singing . After quite a while , during which Cynthia thought black thoughts about Spangle and her students , someone started singing " Tammy . " The woman who sang it had a clear , high voice that would have been very pleasurable to listen to , if she had been singingsomething other than " Tammy . " Cynthia thought that she would like to have enough money to have a house in the country  --  Spangle had once had that  --  and to be able to sit in it and not hear a sound . There would be no phone in the house , and there would be no colorful locals , and if there were , they would n't be magicians . They would be traditionally crazy , maybe  --  religious fanatics , conservatives . It would be nice if there was a garden , and a deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , she would not shoot them . It would be nice to worry , every summer , about what to do with so much zucchini . Zucchini bread . Zucchini bisque . Zucchini biscuits . Zucchini souffle . Zucchini balls . Zucchini-lentil casserole . Zucchini with zucchinisauce . How had she gotten bombed on three Kahluas ? It was unbelievable . Pendergast 's mother had come in , and why had she wanted her son to pass the course , in spite of his having failed every assignment ? Because she did not think that she could cope with one more thing after her double mastectomy . She had said this wearing a thin cotton blouse that was as flat as a piece of paper against her chest . " All I want to do is play tennis and enjoy my summer and hope that I live , " Pendergast 's mother had said to her . The woman had smelled of alcohol . Scotch , probably . Drunk or not , the woman had no breasts . The thought of it made Cynthia jump out of the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The street was empty . Finally a little girl and her mother came by . She watched them until they were out of sight . Of course she could n't flunk Pendergast . She wondered if she could flunk Mary Knapp . She wondered if she would ever have a better job than the one she had this summer . There was a fight going on in the hall . A woman was crying . She thought about putting the chain on and peeking out , but de/cided not to . The woman who was crying  --  no , a different woman , because the crying kept on  --  was saying : " You recorded me singing Tammy , ' you son-of-a-bitch . You give me that goddamn cassette . " Another noise that sounded like a chair breaking . People running down the stairs . She went to the window and looked out . A girl about twenty , in a long , wraparound Indian cotton skirt , red runningshoes , and a silver halter top was running to the left , and a man was chasing a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , picked her up and carried her back toward the building . They passed the building , though , and laughing , continued down the street . Why could n't the magician be interested in them ? Another woman , with a sailor 's cap and white pants and a black shirt , came down the steps . She did n't seem to be drunk . She turned around to wave , and Cynthia jerked her head back from the window . She peeked again , to see if the magician was out there . He was , but she could n't see him . He really did manage to come out of nowhere . She tried to imagine where he could be hiding that he would have a view of the street in front of the building , but she never saw him . Pendergast 's mother had asked her if she played tennis . Bobby called again , this time to give her a message for Spangle . The message was that he was saving an article for Spangle from the New York Times about umbrella bamboo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the world 's umbrella bamboo was about to flower and die . " It 's not as depressing as it sounds , if you read the article , " Bobby said . " When Spangle gets back , ask him to call me . Here 's my number . Have you got a pencil ? " She found enough Grand Marnier , left over from a souffle they had made a long time ago , to have a shot-glassful . She drank it , thinking that it was probably possible to combine zucchini and Grand Marnier . The Desperation Cookbook , she would call it . At the end of every recipe it could say , " If desperate , substitute any ingredients . " My God  --  imagine not having your breasts . What awful things happened to women . She went into the bedroom and undressed . She took her cotton nightgown from the foot of the bed and put it on , thinking that she would shower later . There was nothing in the apartment to cat , and undressing removed the temptation to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom floor . She got into bed , put Spangle 's pillow behind her pillow , and stretched out . Flipping through the paper , she found some answers to a quiz she had n't seen : 2 . Mr. Niehouse , an American businessman , was rescued and returned to the United States after having been held captive by leftist guerrillasin Venezuela since his kidnapping in February 1976. 3 . The number of passenger cars has remained about the same . She looked through the rest of the paper . Mayor Koch , she found out , had refused to control the pigeon problem by shooting them . His reason was : " When you go after a pigeon , all the people who love pigeons will hate you . " She read about police officer Ignatius Gentile , who jumped in front of a subway car in Brooklyn . She learned that Bloomingdale 's had quickly sold out of its Skylab Protective Helmet . She spent most of the time studying the crossword puzzle , wondering about 49 down : "  - -  Across the Table , " 1934 song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Madrid . Pendergast 's mother 's breasts were gone . Only the magician was sure to be out there , all revved up , full of tricks , eager to talk . If she thought he was dangerous , she would have been terrified , but she was more frightened of that crazy what'shis-namein her class , with his motorcycle and his painted-on smile , than she was of the magician . Maybe she could agree to have coffee and donuts with him in exchange for his coming to her class and doing magic tricks . He could have the students jump through a burning hoop , and if they missed , what the hell . The phone rang , and she almost did n't answer it , but at the last minute , the eighth ring , she thought that it might be Spangle . She went to the phone . It was her sister . Cynthia told her that she had written her a letter , but that she did n't have to worry  --  it would n't get mailed . In the morning she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out , the temptation to send it would be gone . " How nasty was it ? " her sister said . " I said you 'd sold out for money and security . " " That 's certainly true . What was the nasty part ? "  |p193Cynthia  sighed . " I 'm glad I did n't bother to go mail it . " " What did you mean before , when you said that in the morning you 'd dare to go out ? " " Oh , I was n't really serious . There 's some creepy guy around here who 's from the ' West Coast  --  I guess that part is true , at least  --  and he 's got a crush on me . Guess what he is . " " A midget ? " " No . A serious guess . " " A Rolfer . " " No . You 're getting close . Sort of close . " " Do n't let a Rolfer touch you . It 's just sadism . " " Come on , guess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles . " " Not much help . Is he a shrink of any kind ? " " No . " " Movies . " " Nope . Not movies . " " If he 's not a midget Rolfer who 's writing a screenplay , I ca n't guess . " " A magician . A **30;6756;TOOLONG type magician . " " Jesus . I 'd watch out for him . " " I guess I would n't talk about him so much if he did n't sort of give me the creeps . I 've only seen him three times actually , but he just appears . He 's odd . He talks like we 're old friends . " " You 're right . Do n't go out . You can insult me on the phone . It 's Bill 's money , too . Fifteen cents for a stamp . " " Is he richer and richer ? " Cynthia said . " God , yes . Of course . He wants to have a baby . " " Do n't do it . " " Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . Ioverate strawberries , and you remember how fruit used to make me break out ? I went to a dermatologist and told him I sprayed myself with cologne all over , and he said it was the cologne , of course , and that I had to stop using it . I made him put it in writing . At first Bill wanted me to try new scents , but I told him that the dermatologist had said no : nothing on my skin but Castile soap . So for the first time in years I do n't smell like a florist 's . Ifp194he hints around about trying a new cologne , I just buy a pint of strawberries and eat them on the sly . But the baby thing  --  my God . He read that Leboyer book , which he got from some guy flying first-class with him from Atlanta to New York , and by the time he hit LaGuardia , he could hardly wait to get the limo home to tell me that he thought something of ours should be born to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class . " " You 're not going to marry him , are you ? " " Well , I might . I just would n't have a baby . I know it 's corny , but I really do love the Moonlight Sonata , and once I 'd gritted my teeth through it , it would be ruined forever . " " What are you eating ? " Cynthia said . " A vegetable burrito . Leftovers from last night 's dinner . The same man who gave him the Leboyer book gave him a recipe for vegetable burritos , and he went out and bought all the ingredientsand made them . God . " She stopped chewing . " But the reason I called is to say that we 're going to have a house on the Vineyard next month , and we want you to come see us . He has a rich friend who is n't too old . Fortyish . He 'd love to meet you . Spangle does n't deserve you . If he wanted to get home he could haul ass , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his mother , too . She calls almost every damn night , and she means to be nice , but I just ca n't stand to talk to her . She 's crazier than Spangle , in her way . " " I never thought Spangle was particularly crazy . I just do n't think he has enough money . We 'll have a convertible on the Vineyard . " " He 'll get you pregnant . Then what will you do ? " " Honey , I am not helpless . " " He 's going to trick you , somehow . " " You 're the one I 'm worried about . It would be just like Spangle to come back to New Haven and propose to you , and I think you might even do it . " " No . I feel differently from the way I felt when he left . It 's hot in this apartment and I work all the time , and I feel like I 've been abandoned . I 'm not in the mood to tie a bandanna around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come to the Vineyard . We 'll have the house full-time , after this weekend . It 's going to be a Mustang convertible . "  | " Thanks for the invitation . I 'll probably come . " " Spangle 's welcome , you know . I say awful things about him , but I like him . I even downplayed how crazy he was a minute ago . That was a nice thing to do for him , was n't it ? " " It would take a lot more than a casual remark from you to convinceme at this point . I keep having the feeling that he 's not in Madrid , but I guess he is . I mean , where would he be ? He was n't mad at me when he left . He was kidding around , like always . " " Anybody could be anywhere . I 'd say listen to your hunches . " " I feel like he 's around . I feel that way about the magician , too , so maybe it 's just paranoia . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He does . But not every time . Never in the morning . " " Stay in until morning , " she said . " Jesus . " She was chewing again . " I got lonesome for you tonight . I liked it when we saw each other more . Why do n't you come live near us in Philadelphia ? " " Why do n't you find me a job ? " " I found you a man . Good-looking , too . Forty-nine , to be honestwith you , but a very nice body . He does n't even wear glasses . And there are no children . One Irish wolfhound only . He talks about getting another one , but I doubt it . You can see him running down the beach every morning with the dog from all the windows across the front of the house we 're going to be renting . Sometimes it just kills me that Bill has so much money . Like Dylan says : ' I ca n't help it if I 'm lucky . ' " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how somebody gets shot and he runs away with the man 's wife , and she 's got all her husband 's money . Bill 's wife just dropped dead at fifty-four . I never even met her . I have nothing to feel guilty about . You 've got a job and I do n't , though . Not that I ever wanted one , but maybe that was because I worked such shit jobs . Remember the telephone company ? That awful dress shop where everything stank of incense ? " She laughed . " God , there 's a whole bank of white hyacinths in the courtyard outside this window . The spotlight is on them , and there are moths flying above them , a storm of moths . You promise to come to the Vineyard ? " " I promise , " Cynthia said . When she hung up , she went to the window again . A police carp196drove down the block very fast and turned the corner with its light flashing . A tall , thin girl that she recognized walked into the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . She was probablysilly for staying in , for letting some pathetic , odd man get to her so much that she would n't go out for food . She would n't . She went back into the bedroom , set the alarm for early and went to bed . It was strange not to have Spangle in the bed . She had gotten used to the way he tore the covers up from the bottom and turned and thrashed all night , flapping his arms like some big , heavy bird . She was even used to him screaming , his arms covering his head , his body tensed for the fireball that he imagined rolling toward him like a bowling ball rolling down the lane  --  the lane was the bed he slept in . It was so quiet in bed when Spangle was n't there . She bounced on the mattress a couple of times , to hear it make a noise . Then it was quiet again . When Spangle was there , he fell asleep so deeply so soon that she spent the first hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers out of his fist , across herself . When she was alone , she thought . She thought about what had become of her sister , and about Mrs. Pendergast 's breasts , and about what she had said  --  that she only wanted to play tennis . There were a lot of things for which graduate school did not prepareyou . That was the virtue of it , Spangle said  --  that you could spend years learning , and in the end , almost nothing you learned would apply . But Cynthia thought it would be helpful if somethingprepared you for a talk with Mrs. Pendergast . When she had to think quickly , she could never think of anything to say . Her adviceto Spangle was easy  --  she had it down to four words now : " There is no fireball . " She had not even thought of that many words to say when Mrs. Pendergast had started crying . It seemed wrong just to say no when she was asked if she played tennis . But that was the one word she had said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that began , " Someone 's got it in for me. "  |p197He  had intended to play it cool , but for days he had been thinking about seeing her , and it was a hot night and he could n't sleep , and finally it started to make sense to him that he should dress and go out . He would n't see her , but he would see where she lived . Maybe his walking by would generate some good energy and he could send it to her , and she would feel it . She would probably be asleep . It was almost one in the morning . He would think thoughts of love and close his eyes and try to send the thoughts like little darts into her dreams . He put on his white painter 's pants with the loops on the sides . Keys on key rings dangled from each side of his pants . Keys to the crazy millionaire Tucker 's house in Beverly Hills : Tucker gave away keys because he thought that it would assure him of not being killed in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he kept a brandy snifter full of Andes mints , matches from The Palm , and house keys on the hall table by the door . Keys to his friend Roy 's beachhouse in Malibu : three locks on the front door , and Roy would n't see an astrologer on a bet . The keys to his mother 's apartment here in New Haven . A keyp198that he had had for years , found in Golden Gate Park , a heavy , old-fashioned key with a tiny piece of tape across the top with J. Brown lettered on it . He liked to think that it would fit the lock in Governor Jerry Brown 's apartment . That would be a lot more status than having one of the many keys to Tucker 's . He wished that he had her key . He would put it in the lock , thinking good thoughts : that she should n't be afraid , that he only wanted to talk to her , that he was willing to talk about things other than magic . To tell the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ; he had been reading the newspaperat his mother 's and getting mad about all the injustices in the world , and about how little the country did for its citizens . He had read , in the New York Times , that the mayor was not in favor of shooting pigeons , although the mayor did agree with somebody else who had said that they were like rodents with wings . If the mayor and all his staff and all the working people in New York got together and thought , it might be possible to send messages to the pigeons to get them to go away and roost somewhere else . He was glad that the mayor was not going to give his okay to pigeon-killing , even though he said he did n't like the pigeons . People gave the okay to things too much , and that ruined the world for magic . When so many things of all sorts were happening , people 's minds got overloaded , and they stopped caring whether a woman was sawed in half or levitated from a table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty . It would be hard to care about magic if you read the paper every night , because there were so many explanations : why pigeons thrived in New York , how we could be sure that there was n't gasoline hidden in tanks in New Jersey , what you could do if you were followed by someone you thought meant you harm , how to plant zucchini . When people did calm down and got ready to watch magic , all they cared about was what was behind it . Or else they wanted somethingfrom it : They wanted you to wave a wand and send the pigeons out of New York ; they wanted to believe that you could make their zucchini multiply overnight , instead of waiting for the seeds to germinate . But he was thinking about magic again , and he 'd sworn to himself that this would be a real vacation , and he would n't think about magic all the time . Ile tried to think aboutp199national health insurance , but his mind bogged down and he got images of dogs leaping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the plant covered by a cloth , and when the cloth was pulled back , an orchid was blooming on the plant . He wondered if it would make an impression if he took her an orchid . He did not think that there was anywhere to buy an orchid in New Haven at one in the morning ( he thought he knew where he could do it in Malibu ) , and even if he had it , of course , she would be asleep . His mother 's Vogue had suggested that the caring hostess might put a fresh orchid on her guest 's pillow . His mother heard the keys jingling and said , " Where are you going ? " " I 'm going to take a walk , " he said . " When are you going back to California ? " she said . He wished she would stop asking that . He wondered if even an orchid would shut her up , and decided that it would n't . He did n't answer her . He picked up his false nose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went out the door . He turned around and pulled the knob three times , to make sure that it was really closed and not just stuck . She always got up after him to check the door  --  it was a funny door  --  and if he did manage to have a nice night somehow , he would n't want to ruin it by coming back to the apartment and having to listen to one of her tirades . He walked until he came to her block , and then to her building . He was nervous . He had given up cigarettes six months ago , so he fished his false nose out of his pants pocket and tapped it onto his nose , took it off again , put it in place again . Then he put it back in his pocket . The one rabbit that became twenty was in the pocket , too . She had liked that . Maybe he had just shown her too much too quickly . He could have shown her the tricks over a period of time . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the one he thought was hers  --  and in several other apartments there was faint bluish light . As he watched , someone began to move around one of the apartments . The person opened the window . It was n't her . Maybe it was her husband , if she really had a husband . The way she had said it , he had doubted it , and he was usually good at picking up those vibrations . He crossed the streetp200and looked at the building , sending good thoughts into the windows . In response , music started playing . The thoughts had gotten in to the people ! They were joyful ; there was music ! He crossed the street again , and close to the building he heard that it was a sad song he had listened to when he was a child ; but it did n't sound like Debbie Reynolds singing . " Wish I knew that he knew what I 'm thinkin ' of . . . " It was always so hard to get through to people , even if you tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could do better than speaking to them . He reached in his pocket and took out a handkerchief and tossed it toward the windows on the third floor . As it rose , the handkerchief opened and unfolded into something close to the shape of a dove . He kissed the tips of his fingers and waved his hand in the direction of the handkerchief-bird . Then , when it fell , he retrieved it and shook it flat and put it in his pocket . Of course , at almost two A.M. , she would not be awake . But somehow  --  psychically  --  had n't his loving thoughts come home to roost ?  |p201THIS  Is a friend of mine from college , " Nina said . " I can tell from the expression on your face what you 're thinking . A great number of people act very strangely , but my strangeness is that I 'm so predictable . I did n't sleep with him . " The man , whoever he was , laughed . He got up from the sofa , where he was sprawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand out . " It 's true , " he said . " How do you do ? I 'm Peter Spangle . " He shook the man 's hand . Nina went into the kitchen , and he could see her , bowl of cereal on the counter at her side , peeling an orange . " I have to talk to you , " John said , going into the kitchen . He rubbed his hand across her shoulder blades , low , where the yellow tiger was lunging . " My robe , " he said . " Nina ? " he said . " I 've got to go to work . I do n't have a rich husband like you to support me . If I do n't go to work , I get fired . It 's nobody 's fault but mine that I got wrecked last night , but I am trying  --  " She nicked her thumb cutting the orange . She put the knife down and went to the cold water and turned it on . She put her cut finger under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought : blood . " You two want to talk . I guess I ought to get going anyway , " Spangle said . He pulled his T-shirt over his head . " What she said was the truth , " he said , brushing his hair out of his face . " I 'm sure it is the truth . " " I 'm sure it does n't much matter to anybody , " Nina said . " We never really discussed it , but since you think I 'm so perfect , that must be something you 're liberal-minded about , right ? " John leaned over , bracing himself with his elbows on the kitchen counter . " Why are you doing this ? " he said . " Nina ? " " What are you doing here at seven o'clock in the morning ? I might like a little privacy . People show up whenever they want , spend the night  --  you do n't show up and spend the night , you do that when you feel inclined and you do n't when you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 'd owe you some apology . " " I 'm going to call you , " Spangle said . " Take care . " " Wait , " Nina said . " Just wait . " She followed Spangle out of the apartment , closing the door behind her . " I embarrassed you , " she said , at the foot of the stairs . " You did n't embarrass me . You 're his girl , right ? You did n't sleep with me . We both agree . How can I be embarrassed ? " " Please do n't go , " she said . " Wait a minute . I 'm not even clear on what you two were doing here . " " We flew back from Madrid and I did n't feel like going back to New Haven , and he certainly did n't want to check in with my mother , and my esteemed brother scored some hash in the toilet at Kennedy and we looked you up in the phone book , and the rest of it  --  Horton what's-his-name  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head , laughed . " My motives were n't pure , " he said . " Maybe if we had n't gotten wrecked , you would n't have been telling him the truth this morning . " " I would have told him the truth whatever it was . " " Then I 'm glad we did n't . After a night like that , the last thing I need is to have my head knocked all the way off . " " I 'm embarrassed now , " Nina said . " Then we 're even , " he said . " You were right . I was embarrassed . You ought to go back up . " She shook her head . " I do n't know , " she said . " I still can'tp203believe that I 'm standing in this hallway talking to you . The two of you were in Spain all these years ? " " I was just over there a couple of weeks . He was shacked up with some senorita who was trying to get him to pay for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out . I went over to get him . " " I wish I had a sister or a brother , " she said . " You 've got good friends . Reliable friends , " he said . " They might go a few years without seeing you , but eventually they show up . " It makes me nervous that everything just happens , " she said . " I mean , I can sort of count on people , sometimes , but other times ... for some reason , I just did n't appreciate his coming over here this morning unannounced . " " You 'd better go back , " Spangle said . " Jonathan 's going to be staying with friends in the West Village . I 'll be coming in to see him . Can we see you ? Straight ? " " What about the girl you live with ? Is n't she coming ? " " I 've been trying to think about that , and all I know is that right now I ca n't think about that . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She blames me for living . She 's got a lousy job this summer , and she takes it out on me . I guess she 's got a right to . I 'm just not up for it today . " " Where are you going ? " " I do n't know . " " Do you want me to leave you the key ? You could come back here when I 'm at work . You could use some sleep . " " The offer 's just for the key and sleep ? " She sighed , shook her head no , but said , " I do n't know . Do you want it ? " " I 'd be a real shit to louse things up for you , " he said . " No . But let 's have dinner , you and me and Jonathan . " " Okay , " she said . " Thanks . " He turned to go . " It was so strange seeing you again . I should n't have gotten that stuff from Horton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to deal with anything either , " he said . He  |p204He  could only comb the top part ; his hair was long , and it had gotten hopelessly matted from the ears to the shoulder . He looked the way he had at Bard . If she remembered correctly what he had looked like when he first walked in , he had even looked healthy . No living on Drake 's Ring Dings and reds ; the sunshine of  --  where was it ? " Where were you in Spain ? " she said . " Madrid . " He shook his head . " I know , " he said . " Fucked , fucked , fucked . Call you later in the week . " " Call me , " she said . " I 'll call you , " he said . " Call me , " she said . He laughed and she smiled . She went upstairs smiling . She had not recovered as well from the night before as she had thought ; she realized it when she went to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained the sleeve of the robe . She took it off the minute she got in the door , disgusted , and took it to the bathroom , holding the sleeve under cold water in the sink . " What 's the matter ? " he said , standing in the doorway to the bedroom . He wanted her to say : Nothing . What 's the matter with you ? She did n't answer him . He watched her washing the sleeve of the robe . She had on a pair of white underpants , and nothing else . Her hair was n't combed . " I cut up the orange for you , " he said . He walked away , went to the sofa and lifted books and papers off it and sat down . She went from the bathroom into the kitchen without saying anything . " I think what I blurted out was the truth : that I hardly ever see you , and if I work all the time , I should get to have fun , too . Why do n't you give your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , " he said . " You really do n't know what you 're saying . " " Why do n't I know what I 'm saying ? " She started to sit next to him , decided to sit on the floor instead . When she sat down , everything started to slow up : She could n't say the sentences she had thought to say ; lifting the spoon from the bowl to her mouth was an effort . Her finger throbbed , and she looked down at the toilet paper she had wrapped around her finger , to see if it was red.  |p205It  was white . She spooned another piece of orange off the top of the cereal and put it in her mouth and chewed . " Why do n't I know what I 'm saying ? " " Can we talk ? " he said . " Are you going to rush out of here ? " He was crying . She looked up and saw that tears were rolling down his cheeks . She got up and walked to the sofa , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You 're right , " he said . " I do n't do this well , and I certainly did n't do that well . " " Wait a minute , " she said , lifting his hand off his leg , grabbing it hard . " What is going on ? " " I do n't know how to say this , " he said . " I 'm just starting to realize that it 's odd that I 'm here . Will you call Nick ? Can you see if he 's going to be around ? " " Call Nick at home ? " she said . " It 's early in the morning , is n't it ? I forgot that . I can call Nick later , " he said . " In the meantime , why do n't you tell me what 's going on ? " " Jesus Christ , " he said . " What if you had slept with him ? What if I walked in on that ? " " You could call before you come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think of this as home . " " It 's my home . Your home is in Connecticut . Or Rye . Wherever you want to say it is . " " It 's here , " he said , balling up a pillow . " It 's here , whatever you say . " He threw the pillow , hard . It tipped over an empty bottle  --  a ginger-ale bottle with cigarette butts in it . He stared at the chaos of the room . " Nina , " he said , " I was coming up those stairs , and you do n't know what I was going through , trying to get to the top . It would have been such a goddamn soap opera if you had been here with somebody else . " " Maybe it 's a soap opera anyway . A quick dinner and an offcamerafuck . Sometimes I think trying to keep you is hopeless , like trying to keep a hat from blowing away in the wind , when you ca n't even put your hand up to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even grab on to the edge of something . If we had n't gotten stoned , I do n't know what things would have been like when youp206appeared here this morning . I just know that I 'm tired of trying to keep things together . I feel like I do n't have any control . I 'm sick of it . I might as well sit here and smoke the rest of that grass and lose my job , and not fucking care . You can support me , like a real mistress . Make this a real soap opera . " She got up , because her words were coming out funny , and she thought she was going to cry . She picked up the bowl of cereal and sat down again . She realized that the bowl was not a crystal ball , but she stared into it . " You ca n't go to work , " he said . " You are n't going to work , are you ? " " You 'd better tell me what 's going on . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on here . Now you tell me why you showed up here at seven-thirty in the morning , and why I ca n't go to work . " " It 's not a quick dinner and a quick fuck . I 've spent eight hours here a lot of nights . I 've gotten back to Rye at three in the morning , and had to work the next day . " " You want it to be over . Is that it ? " " That is the last thing I want . " " Shall we play twenty questions ? " " Can we go lie down ? Just lie down ? " He would n't talk when they went into the bedroom . After a long while he rolled from his back to his stomach . He was too still , and too quiet , to be asleep . She decided to say nothing and wait . She even felt sorry enough for him , after a while , to put her hand on his back . She got up on one arm and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine , up again , lightly massaged his neck . She stared at the clock . Five minutes passed . She called Lord and Taylor 's and said that she was sick . Crying helped . She went back to bed and saw that he had rolled over on his back again , and that his eyes were very red  --  from being against the pillow , or because he had cried , she could n't tell . She stroked her hand down his chest . She unbuttoned his shirt and stroked the bare skin . " Okay , " she said . " What ? " " What I was feeling coming up those stairs , " he said . " It was like coming to you was happening in slow motion . There were so many feelings , and they kept getting heavier and heavier . They were stopping me from moving . "  | " It 's good you did n't get stoned with us . If you think that when you 're straight , you would n't have been a good influence last night . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last night . " " Look , " she said , " tell me you 're all right , and we can sleep , or you can have me play twenty questions , or if you just want to talk , I 'll listen to you . All right ? " Her finger was tracing the line of his breastbone . He could close his eyes , and feel a small path being traced on his body . Her finger inched along , traveling little distances . He had driven , on no sleep , from Connecticut to New York , gone to the garage , gotten a cab to her apartment , and now he was feeling more than he had felt in all the time he had been awake , traveling , going crazily from one place to the next . He was here , and still . Her finger was moving , curving around his body . " I 'm all right , " he said . " Mary is n't . John Joel shot her . "  |p208He  was walking up the stairs . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain-damaged people to do . Later , when they master the mechanics of climbing , they teach them not to frown or squint . The trick is not to show that you 're concentrating . There was a school for brain-damaged people  --  teenage children , mostly  --  somewhere near where he worked , and several times during his lunch hour he had seen them parading down the street . They had things to do : trash to throw away . Well  --  maybe that was the only thing . They had trash to throw away . He and Nick had been coming back from lunch the first time , and Nick had called his attention to them . As months went by he and Nick had watched their progress . It was horribly slow progress , and it might never have occurred to them to think of it as progress at all if Nick had n't noticed the way they had stopped holding hands . At first , they held hands like small schoolchildren . Then they walked close together , almost shoulder to shoulder . Then , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking close together  --  men steering women along , their hands on their bare shoulders , people hip to hip on the grass in Central Park  --  thep209brain-damaged people had let go of each other and walked farther apart . Either they had been taught not to frown and look frightened or the spring had touched them in some way . One time , as they watched , a man carrying a blaring cassette player got into the middle of them , and they started to scatter like frightened ducks ; then the two men at the front came and tried to round them up . Eventually they did , and the parade huddled together again and turned the corner . Nick claimed he watched because it reminded him that there were worse problems than having to deal with Metcalf . He claimed he watched because Nick had gotten him hooked . He was not used to seeing slow , regular movement in the city . He had gotten used to watching people slap down change for the newspaper without missing a beat , to arms suddenly stretched out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could n't tell whether or not they were together . Even when they spoke to each other , that did n't mean for sure that they were together . Walking up the steps to Nina 's apartment , he had thought for a second that something was missing  --  a leader was missing . And no one was behind him . He was there alone , doing this simple thing ; and he thought that he was never going to be able to make it to the top , and that if he did , it was too much to expect that he would have a pleasant expression on his face when he got there . He would just have to get there and be there , and then  --  and then what ? The stairs were buckling and shifting under him ; they were delivering him to a room that would tilt crazily . He rubbed his face . He had n't had any sleep , and he was exhausted , and the faint stinging-itch across his neck , below his ears , had started : the signalthat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been on the stairs for a long time . He kept looking over his shoulder , as though there were better air below him , and if he turned his head he might be able to breathe . He kept turning his head , and the building was quiet  --  no one behind him . But every time he moved forward , there were just as many stairs , it seemed . His legs felt heavy . His head . Finally he had dashed up the stairs and gotten to the top , panting , feeling as crazy as one of the braindamagedpeople would feel if he were capable of seeing himself in perspective . If the piece of paper drops on the sidewalk instead of into the trash container , so what ? So what ? he was saying outp210loud . So what ? he whispered . No one heard the whisper , and he did not hear any noise : no breakfast dishes clattering , no radio music , no alarms going off . He put his hands over his ears and took them away , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hearing was fading . What if Nina opened the door and said something , said some important thing , and he did n't know what she was saying ? His eyes hurt too much to concentrate on reading her lips . Her lips . Nina . He knocked on the door , and he smiled . He heard something . From inside , he heard water running . And then he knocked again , and then she was there : he could see her breasts almost down to the nipples . She had on the robe she had given him , and when she spoke , he heard what she said . He saw the man , standing to the side . For an awkward second , nobody said anything . He looked behind him and saw the stairs . When he blinked , they stopped slowly swaying.  |p211ALTHOUGH  HE HAD promised Brandt he would take him to see the Little League game that night , he had gone to the house in Connecticut , instead of going back to Rye . Louise had called him and said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint ? " he said , hoping that he was keeping his voice even . It had to be that she wanted a divorce . All that hanging out with Tiffy Adamson had paid off in the long run ; Louise had not called him at the office for a year , except about the most trivial things . Certainly her callinghim , in New York and asking him to call the house in Connecticutbecause she was too busy , and Mary had to put hamburger meat out to defrost , was a little dig at him , a reminder that there was a world there he was n't a part of . It also let him know how banal she thought that world was , but that she was doing the proper thing , coping with it , while he was not . She had called and asked him to ask Mary to put hamburger meat out . He laughed , telling Nina later , and Nina had said that she thought it was sad . " Which part of it ? " he said , and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten through to Louise . She had convinced her to ask for a divorce . " No hints , " she said . " Will you he here for dinner , or later ? " " I 'll come for dinner , " he said . Ile was suddenly feeling gen/erous . The end of summer was coming , and she was making it easy for him  --  she was asking him to go instead of making him ask her . She was going to tell him that she wanted a divorce . After a little while , he felt almost melancholy about it . He told Nick , when he came in with iced coffee for the two of them , that his sadness was n't really much about what he was losing : Visiting rights would give him as much time with Mary and John Joel as he spent with them now ; and if he gave Louise what she wanted and she was halfway reasonable , they might even be friends in the way they had n't been friends for years . His sorrow was that he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost a lot , fast , years ago ; he had lost it and the loss had never caught up with him , and now he did n't feel much emotion about saying that it was gone . " It would serve you right if she demanded a mink coat . If that 's what the call was about , " Nick said . " My wife used to call when we were fighting it out in court . She would be in the courtroomthe day before and would n't even look at me , let alone speak , and then as though nothing had happened , she 'd call and tell me about an August fur sale at Bendel 's . " Nick was talking , but John was only half listening to him . He was looking at the picture of his family , minus Brandt , on Nantucket , and thinking how sad it must be to have old pictures , happy pictures , and suddenly see something ironic in them years later . Or for those pictures to give you a sense that something meaningful had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the same way he had felt when the roll of film came back from the camera store , the same way he had felt when he picked out the one he wanted to have enlarged to five by seven  --  that this was the expected picture . It was a picture he had known would exist one day before he ever met and married Louise . He stared at Mary 's bathing suit , at the rows of gingerbread men , arms outstretched , touching hands . A band of gingerbread men , and then another , and then another , as evenly spaced , as regular , as the gray bands on his mother 's television screen , but not rolling  --  no movement . Just the line of them , brown and expressionless . The gingerbread men looked like Mr. Bill . The man in the camera store had said that it would cost more , but that they could fix the print ; they could burn in the deck , for instance . " Burn it ? " John had said.  |p213The  man at the camera store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of a photographer , sick to death of looking at pictures like this day after day . " When you develop a picture  --  if it 's there in the negative  --  you can give some parts of the picture more exposure time than the rest , and that will darken it , bring in detail . " He had been so interested in the things the man described that he had bought a book about developing and printing pictures that he found for a dollar at a tag sale that summer . But he had not had the picture improved . He had just wanted it enlarged , and then he had framed it . No burning or dodging . Holding back , putting more in  --  it was a joke , how sexual everything was . He looked at Louise , her stomach big with Brandt , forcing her rows of gingerbread men to curve . He had a picture of Nina that he loved  --  the only picture he had ever seen of her as a child , a picture her mother had sent to her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , Nina thought , at a table in a seafood restaurant they went to in Atlantic City . Nina was sitting in an inside chair , next to her mother , a too-large white sailor 's hat perched on her head like Jughead 's crown , and her hands were neatly folded on the table  --  it could have been a Bible , instead of a food-stained tablecloth  --  and Nina looked beatific . He had had trouble explaining to her why he used that word . The glass of ginger ale  --  it had one of those silly paper umbrellas resting on the rim of the glass , and a cherry sunk halfway down  --  might have been a chalice . Her face was clear and pretty , and she looked like the Nina he knew now did when she was sleeping ; but her big child 's eyes were open in the picture , and she was smiling a little more than she ever did in her sleep . Her father sat across from her . He had her wide-set eyes , her widow 's peak , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat next to her father . There was a beer bottle in front of her uncle 's place , a Coke bottle beside a glass where her mother sat , and her father had a glass on a stem , a martini glass . Nina could remember her father telling the woman who came to the table to photograph them that he would take one big picture and a set of matchbooks . What had become of a dozen matchbooks with Nina 's family on them ? " When they start to harden , they want fur , " Nick was saying . " Ever notice that ? When their hair gets dry and they go to exercisep214class and get all toned up , they start thinking about fur . " Nick puffed on his cigarettte , not inhaling . " When they start to get old , and they 're afraid of getting cold . They think about being hard and cold and in the ground , and the answer is a mink coat . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " " Metcalf just passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to think of some way to convince the twenty-five-and-under crowd that they want to wear mink and not worry about dead animals . I 've got to convince people twenty-five and under that it does n't matter that some animal is trapped and killed . " Nick got up and looked out the window . " I do n't want to , " Nick said . " Days like today , I 'd like to just lie in the grass naked . Maybe I could do somethingalong the lines of the avocado ads , where the woman grows the plant from the pit . I could offer the twenty-five-and-under crowd a free bag of mink bones with their coat . Tell them their wishes would all come true if they wished on a mink bone . Poor minks . Poor fuckers . " Nick wandered out of the office . In the corridor he turned and said : " I wish you luck . I really do . I hope she wants a divorce and does n't take you for everything you 've got . But I guess it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious about liking that tiny apartment on Columbus Avenue . " He called Nina at Lord and Taylor 's to tell her that Louise had called , and that he thought she was going to ask for a divorce . He changed his mind about telling her , though , and he was half glad when he was connected with the wrong person . He knew that Nina thought he was a coward . " A wise coward , " she said , qualifying it . " I do n't know that I 'd walk out on a family . " She had had dreams , when they first met , that she was bobbing in the water along with Louise and John Joel and Brandt and Mary , and that he was in a boat only large enough to take one of them on board . Sometimes he would reach for her , sometimes Louise , sometimes one of the children . She would tread water for what seemed like hours . And then she would dream the rest of it : No matter who he reached for , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puzzled because what was in the boat was a starfish , or a sea nettle , a sea anemone , a water lily , a conch shell . Some small , beautiful sea creature would be in the boat with him . She had toldp215him the dream in early May , the second time they had gone away together , to Nick 's sister 's house in Provincetown . High up on one of the dunes , a bright day with still an edge of winter , she had suddenly remembered , looking out at the water , her peculiar dreams about the drifting boat , the outstretched arm . They had sat on top of one of the dunes , the beach deserted , and she had told him about it , shaking her head in embarrassment , because the dream obviously meant that she thought he could save her . He had made light of it . The truth was that he did not think of her as someone who needed saving . He thought that she could save him , that her light grip on his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anchoring his body to the earth . Who would he really save if they were all in the water ? He thought that he would try to haul all of them into the boat , too ashamed to claim the one he really wanted . She was right : He was a coward . He kicked a little sand down the slope and watched it gather more with it and go like a trickle of water until it stopped . Now the shape of the dune was different , though no one else would notice . He looked at it . He could n't look at her . He did n't know what to say when she was so honest . He did n't know how to say , simply , okay , if you think that having me will save you , you can have me . If he could really have believed that he would be leaving Louise and the children to save her , then he probably would have done it instantly , but he was sure that he was leaving to save himself . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could . She was more complicated than she knew . She dreamed questions while he dreamed answers : In the morning her questions were still good , but his answers were simple , facile . They did n't apply . Later that clay he and Nina had gone back to the house , sure that everyone would know that they had made love , and Nick had been in the kitchen with Laurie , who was his girl then , scrubbing clean a bucket of mussels . They had had a stew made of mussels and shrimp , and they had all gotten a little drunk on ale . Nick 's sister had a movie projector , and they had watched Dial M for Murder after dinner , and then gone for a walk along the beach . Nick 's straw hat had blown off , and Laurie had chased it into the cold , black water . When she retrieved it , she shook it and put it on , holding the hat with one hand , and Nick 's hand with her other . Back at thep216house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : having some huge , grand house somewhere by the sea , and all your good friends living in the house . There could n't be any cats , because he hated cats ; but there could be dogs , hundreds of collies , poking their long snouts into everything , miracle collies that would go to the beach to sniff out mussels and come up with truffles instead . Truffles would roll around the huge house like billiard balls . They would play indoor miniature golf with truffles . Nick 's sister had sighed . She was just back from France , and had made the mistake of telling him about the white truffle she had brought back with her . The next afternoon they had eaten it , grated over pasta . When they left on Sunday night , they were high on nothing but the good time they had had . He and Nick had bought a present for Nick 's sister at a greenhouse they walked to early Sunday morning : a plant with pink and silver leaves . He remembered driving a nail into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , handing up the plant . Those wide , tall windows , the view of grapevines and poison ivy just starting to leaf out , clots of tangled green pouring over rocks and onto the sand behind the house . And then the way that scene had looked later , when it was almost dark : the way the vines turned and tangled had reminded him of some nightmare creature crawling toward him , all legs and arms and lumpy greenness . He had jumped when Nina touched him from behind . He had n't known she was there . She had complained  --  jokingly , but she had also been serious  --  that he never let her out of his sight . That was Nina : She thought he was her salvation , and she did n't want him around all the time . What Nick had said earlier about a group of friends living together had really touched him ; he talked to Nina about it , standing at the darkening window . It was so nice to see plants outside , instead of a parade of retards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean air . " You 'd never make it living this way , " she had said . " You 'd be like Thoreau , going home to get his wash done . " Now , in the office , he was thinking again about Provincetown in the off-season : that it would be nice to stride down a sand dune , feel the sand shifting , see it moving into new patterns . Instead , he would be going to the parking garage : walking down the concrete ramp to the cashier , waiting for the black man to bring hisp217car and turn it over to him , then up the ramp , into the traffic , the long drive from New York to his house in Connecticut . And then he would have dinner with them , watching John Joel taking seconds and thirds , and Mary sullen and bored , and Louise  --  how would she act ? He remembered the night in the Chinese restaurant , and how he had tried to get a conversation going with Mary and failed . He wondered what he would try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a real challenge to be polite and calm . She would never make a public announcement . He would have to wait until John Joel and Mary were n't in the room , and then let her speak . Then she could say that he should go , and he could admit that he wanted to go . Then she would either be ugly or not be ugly . Either way , he knew that he would not spend the night , but go back to Rye ; and in the morning , before she went to work , he would call Nina and tell her . Metcalf came into his office , knocking as he walked through the open door . " Why does Nick hate me ? " he said . " What gave you that idea ? " " He subscribes me to magazines and checks the block where it says they 'll bill you later . He 's one of the best idea men we 've got , so I pay a hundred bucks a year , probably more , for magazines that come to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscriptions ? " " You admit it ? " Metcalf said . " No . I just think that if it 's true , you should cancel the sub-scriptions . " " I thought that Country Journal was one of his jokes . I just found out that my son was having it sent to me for my birthday . " John nodded . " You 're supposed to ask when my birthday is . " " When 's your birthday ? " " Monday . Bring me a present . A gag present . Just bring something . I 'm sick of birthdays without cake and ice cream and presents . " Metcalf picked up a pen from the desk and tossed it in the air . " Look at that . A pen that 's not even the company pen . You work better with your own pen . I like that . Are you happy ? " " I might be going to be happy . " " Ask me if I 'm happy . "  | " Are you happy , Metcalf ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metcalf put the pen back on the desk . " I know I 'm obnoxious , " he said . " I like to be asked about myself , and nobody ever asks me . " He turned to leave . " You 're my second-best idea man . Does that make you jealous of Nick ? " " No , " he said . " Trying to create a little friction so I 'd have a friend of my own , " Metcalf said . " I have n't invited either of you to the house this summer . You notice ? " " I noticed . " " Ask me why . " " Why ? ' John said . " I do n't know , " Metcalf said . " I just do n't feel like having one of my usual summer parties and spending a lot of money on food and liquor just so I can get soused and put everybody on the spot . I 'd rather just do it on a smaller basis  --  walk into your office and toss off an insult or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what you said ? " " Yes . " " That makes me jealous . I 'm not going to be anything but fifty , " Metcalf said . " Take me seriously about the present . " When Metcalf left , he closed his eyes and silently prayed that Metcalf would not continue on to Nick 's office and talk the same way . It would take a week to calm Nick down if that happened . " When will you find out if you 're going to be happy ? " Metcalf said , putting his head back in the door . " Tonight . " " What do you know , " Metcalf said . " Notice how I do n't ask you what will determine whether you 'll be happy ? " " I noticed . " " Ask me why . " " Why did n't you ask me ? " John said . " Because I 've got some manners . Not many , but a few , " Metcalfsaid . He smiled and went away . John watched the doorway for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metcalfwas gone . He called his mother , to say that he would n't be home until late . The new housekeeper , Ms. Amoy , answered the phone . She said that his mother was sunbathing , and she wouldp219have to get her . A long time passed , and then his mother 's sleepy voice came on the phone . " I 'm going to have dinner with Louise tonight , " he said . " I wo n't be home until late . " " In the city ? " his mother said . " No . In Connecticut . " " You 're always in the city . You live in the city . Why did n't you have her come in and have dinner there ? " " I did n't think of it , to tell you the truth . Something she said made me think she wanted to see me there . " " It 's your life , " she said . " What do you mean ? " " You run around too much . You can afford an air conditioner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How 's Brandt ? " he said . " Ms. Amoy , as she prefers to be called , is not so cold-blooded when it comes to Brandt . She and Brandt picked berries today , and she let him drop them into the bread mix . He dumped them all in in a pile , after she told him to sprinkle them , and she did n't criticizehim . He 's taken to calling her A , ' whether because she told him to or not , I do n't know . " " How are you ? " he said . " I 'm all right . I went to the store today , in my air-conditioned car . I have n't done much else . " " I 'll see you late tonight , " he said . " I certainly hope so , " she said . " I like to think of you sleeping . That pleases me as much now as it did when you were a troublesome little child , and I wanted you silent and out of my sight . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll get sick , leading such a hectic life . " " Thank you for worrying about me . " " Worry leads to alcoholism , " she said . " If all the ice has melted in my gin and tonic while I 've been inside talking to you , I 'm just going to dump it out . If the ice is still there , then it 's a signal that God meant me to go on drinking it . " Ile hung up , flipped through an artist 's portfolio and wondered whether or not it was deliberate that one long black hair was stretched across two sample layouts on top of the plastic . Ile lifted the hair off carefully and cropped it to the floor . The person hadp220probably figured that he would n't look through the whole portfolio . He had an idea . He went down the hall , to Amy 's office . Amy had long blond hair she wore in a ponytail . He asked for one of her hairs . She paused a moment , then took the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out to him . " Thank you , " he said , taking it carefully . She pushed her hair behind her ears and put the rubber band around it again . " You 're not going to ask why I wanted it ? " he said . " Jesus , " she said , " what is this ? Are you going around in back of Metcalf like his shadow and imitating him ? " " Oh , " he said . " Metcalf was by ? " " I will not answer one more question , " she said , and turned back to her typewriter . He went back to his office and put the hair where the other one had been , then looked through the rest of the portfolio . He wrote himself a note about the artist 's work , put the portfolio to the side of his desk with a note to the secretary to return it . At five o'clock , before anyone else , he left the office . The wise-cracking attendant was n't in the garage . Someone else got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had air conditioning . Out on the street traffic was bumper-to-bumper because of a truck double-parked , and because it was five o'clock . He sat and waited . ' While traffic slowly filtered through the narrow lane between truck and parked cars , he listened to music on the car radio . He switched the station to the one that gave traffic reports . No bad congestion , it seemed . He went back to the music station , and caught the end of " Blue Bayou . " He turned it off when a message for hemorrhoid sufferers came on . It had to be that she was leaving him , or asking him to leave her , because why else would she call him at the office and say with that grave tone of voice  --  that was it , she had sounded grave  --  that she wanted to see him right away ? That night . Tonight . He had been so anxious to face it that he had n't even called Nina , as he did every night . He would stop on the way , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was happening , not until it was all over . He hoped that he and Louise could discuss it tonight , and then the rest of it would be legal technicalities : It would actually be over . The closer he got to the house in Connecticut , the more he doubted it . If she did not want a divorce , though , what couldp221she want on a Tuesday night ? What could she want that she could n't talk about on the phone ? He smiled to himself , remembering telling Nina that there were pillars at the base of his driveway . There were no pillars , but at the foot of his driveway was a police car parked sideways , blockingthe way . He had been about to turn into the driveway without even thinking , and it had taken a few seconds to register that he could n't , and another few seconds to register that the black car was a police car . He got out of his car , but he could only stand and stare . He left the engine running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazard light blinking . If it was anything horrible , she would have told him on the phone . She was calm on the phone . But there was no way that a police car blocking his driveway could mean anything good . He walked around it . Two men with walkie-talkies were in his backyard : men in dark suits , standing back by the tree . They looked at him and did n't say anything . He said nothing to them . The back door was open . If it was something really awful , and if she had not let on , if she had made him walk into it this way deliberately , he was going to kill her . Then he thought , suddenly : Is she dead ? A man with a camera was sitting behind his kitchen table . The camera was beside him on the table and the man , with a can of Coke in front of him , was sitting there with his elbows on the table and his hands cupped one on top of the other , and his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , when John walked in . " Where 's Louise ? " he said . The house was so quiet . So cool , without any air conditioning . He saw a raw chicken , in a roasting pan , on , the stove . Plates and glasses and silverware had been pushed aside so the man could lean on the table and drink his Coke . From outside , a buzz from the walkie-talkies droned on , what sounded like a doorbell with a short in it , a doorbell that kept ringing on its one note , maddeningly . A policeman came into the room , followed by Tiffy Adamson . " Is she dead ? " he said to Tiffy . He knew that he had spoken , but he could n't hear his words . The man sitting at the table got up , picked up his Coke can , held it . " No , " Tiffy said . She sank into a chair across the table from him . He sat in the chair the man had been sitting in , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this when you visitedp222someone in prison . When you took a seminar in college . When you were at a real estate agent 's buying a house . The policeman stood in back of Tiffy and kept looking over his shoulder . " There was a shooting , " the policeman said to John . " She is n't dead . She 's been taken to the hospital . " " Louise ? " he said . " I just talked to Louise . Louise shot her-self ? " " No , " Tiffy said . " Louise is all right . Mary was shot . " Tiffy started to cry . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Mary ? " he said stupidly . " Put your face between your knees , " the policeman said . " Do what ? " he said . " You 're going to faint . Put your head down . Put it down . " He put it down . He felt his cheeks prickling . Surely Louise would n't calmly call him when Mary had been shot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where 's Louise ? " he said . It was hard to talk with his head down between his knees . He felt his Adam 's apple pulsing . " At the hospital , " Tiffy said . " Do you want me to call them for you ? She 's not going to die . They had to operate to remove the bullet . " " What bullet ? " he said . " Put your head down , " the policeman said . " John Joel shot her , " Tiffy said . She bit her lip , stared at him . He put his head down . She was the last thing he saw . He saw her face , and it shimmered , and then it slowly started to darken as his face got hotter and hotter . He tried to look at his own hands , holding the edge of the table , knowing that if he could blink , if he could break his stare , that he could also breathe , and if he could breathe he would n't pass out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and decided that he was talking to himself . The weight he felt was Tiffy 's hands , one on each shoulder , pushing him down into the chair so hard that he thought he would fall through it to the floor . He was still staring , but at nothing  --  atthe refrigerator , the refrigerator in back of where Tiffy had been sitting . So that the refrigerator was actually the last thing he saw , and then when he opened his eyes the first thing he saw again was Tiffy . He saw a glass of water in front of him , with ice in it.  |p223He  heard the policeman saying that it could have been worse , and he was confused : Had Tiffy called the hospital , and had he talked to Louise ? Had Louise really called him and said only that she wanted him to come home ? She had n't even insisted that he come . He said to Tiffy : " She called me this afternoon . I just talked to her . " " She must have called you before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her watch . " It just happened , " she said . " It did n't even happen three hours ago . " " Did you call the hospital ? " he said . " No , " she said . " Is that what you want me to do ? " " What are you doing here ? " he said . " It 's crazy , " she said , " but I was driving by  --  I 'd made strawberrymuffins with the berries we picked the other day and I was bringing them . I walked into the kitchen , and we started to talk , and then we heard it . " " No , " he said . " Yes , " Tiffy said . " Really . " " Drink the water , " the policeman said . " Drink it so we can ask you some questions . Are you all right ? " " No , " he said again . " Put your head down , " the policeman said . " I 'm so sorry , " Tiffy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the men with the walkie-talkies came into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator and took an ice cube out of the bin inside the freezer compartment . " You left your car running , " he said to John . " I turned it off . " He ran the ice cube over his face and neck , dropped it in the sink . " The gawkers are starting to show , " he said . " No , " he said . He heard a buzz on the walkie-talkie , and then everything went still , and silent . He heard himself breathing . " Jesus God , " the man in the suit sighed . " Do I get tired of gawkers . " " Get out there and chase them off , " the policeman said . He had a notebook open . Ile was sitting where Tiffy had sat , and he had opened a notebook . Before him was a perfectly blank page.  |p224Tiffy  was still there when he and Louise got back from the hospitalafter midnight . They had given Louise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and given him more pills to give her later , and he had been horrified that they were going to overmedicateher and that she would die right there in the hospital . The doctors asked if he was all right . The police offered to drive them home . He said that they were fine . He agreed to talk to the police more the next day . Mary was in bed , a bullet removed from her side , and John Joel was there too , on a different floor of the hospital . He had thought that his wife was going to ask for a divorce . Nick had thought that she was going to ask for a fur coat . What had happened was that while his wife was talking to Tiffy Adamson and stuffing chicken to put in the oven , his son had shot his daughter  --  with a gun he had gotten from Parker , apparently . A gun he had fired a shot with , then dropped on the ground . Then John Joel and Parker had climbed down from the tree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught stealing cookies from a jar . Louise had opened the back door , and there they had stood , and Mary was on the ground.  | " She was a bitch , " John Joel had said , when John went into his hospital room . He was in bed , and he looked tired . Fat and pale and tired , the way any ten-year-old would look at midnight . " He does n't know what he 's talking about , " John had said to the nurse who stood in the room . He had not been able to say it to John Joel . He had turned and said it to the nurse . The nurse had acted as if he had n't spoken . She might as well have been a paper cutout of a nurse . She just stood and looked blank-faced . She was all in white , and his son was all in white . He could think of nothing but Mary 's blouse , the blouse that Louise was holding outside the operating room when he got to the hospital , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " She 's alive . She 'll be fine . " They wanted the blouse , and Louise was n't giving it to them . " We need that , " they said , and another person tugged . Louise held on to it . In the room , he had hugged John Joel . He had heard his son 's breathing , and his own breathing , and he realized that his breath was coming fast and hard , and his son 's breathing was the calm breathing of near-sleep , that he was squeezing and not getting squeezed in return . He had been going to take Brandt to a Little League game . His mother had told him to get an air conditioner for his car . He had wished for an air conditioner for his car . That was something he had thought about , a few hours before  --  being cool in his car . He had said that he could drive home with no problem , and he had been lying . He wanted to tell them that he could n't , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course he could drive back . The young cop offered two times to drive him . " You could get your car in the morning , " the young cop had said , and his partner had said , " He knows that , " as he tried to nudge the young cop along . " I did n't know that , " John had said . What he meant was that he had n't thought about it . " You what ? " the cop said . The young cop looked back at him . " Ride ? " the young cop said . IIe had raised his hand , then had no idea why he had done it . lie had waved to the cops . " Nothing , " he had said . He and Louise had ridden to the lobby with the cops , and then the cops had turned and gone one way , and he and Louise had gonep226another . He was trying to think of the fastest route home , and he could n't visualize any of it ; he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he got out on the road  --  he drove by sight , not by road signs , anyway  --  he would remember instantly . He wanted to remember instantly . He wanted to be home , but he was not sure if he could drive there . For a second , the older cop 's face had blurred and he had thought that it was n't a face at all , but a scarab . Then the lines had hardened into features again . Tiffy and her husband were in the house . When they came in , Tiffy 's husband rose to greet them , as if they were visitors . Tiffy just sat and stared . Her husband asked if he wanted them to go . He wanted them to go . " No , " he said . " Sit down , " Tiffy 's husbandsaid . They sat down . Tilly got up and put her arm around Louise 's shoulder . " You were right , " Louise said to T i f f y . " It was a shot . " " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the hospital . They said you were coming home . We did n't know if we should go or stay . Do you want us to sleep in the living room ? Just so we can answer the phone or something ? " Louise looked at John . " That 's very nice of you , " he said . He was thinking : I was at work today . I worked , and I drove back to Connecticut , and Mary and John Joel are in the hospital , and he did it because she was a bitch . He said she was a bitch . It was true that someone could dress very conventionally and still be evil : Nixon with his jacket and tie walking on the beach , for example . But Mary  --  Gingerbread Mary  --  a bitch ? He wondered what his son had meant by that . Tiffy and Louise had gone upstairs . He had heard Louise crying , and Tiffy talking . He hardly knew Tiffy 's husband , and did n't know what to say to him . They sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he thought he would take a walk  --  did he want to come ? He said no . He thought that if he went out to walk , he would start running . He was afraid that he would run until he died . He had been so frightened , watching them swabbing Louise 's arm . He had thought : It 's not to calm her  --  they 're tricking us . " Is this what you want ? " he had said to Louise , but the needle was already in her arm . The doctor turned and glared at him . Then the piece of cotton in place , the nurse clamping her finger over it and pushing Louise down into a chair . She sat very still in the chair , and did n't seem to care that shep227was being stared at . She did n't really seem to notice that he was there , either . She noticed when he walked in , but then she did n't seem to notice him . In the car , she sat with her knees drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her hand , but she would n't let go . He had put his hand over her hands , steered with one hand . He had found the way home , and now he did not want to go out walking . He thought about calling his mother , Nick , Nina . He could n't imagine what he would say . And then he had fallen asleep . He woke up and saw that an hour had passed . He heard Tiff y , still upstairs , still talking . Her husband had not come back . He began to pace the house . He went out to the kitchen and opened the back door . Insects were chirping . Moths came from nowhere and flapped past him , into the bright room . He looked at the tree , at the back of the yard , remembered lifting the robin 's egg , gently , from the grass : the fragile egg , safe in a dish in Nina 's apartment . John Joel had shot Mary from up in that tree , the same tree where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had voluntarily vacated until the birds were gone . The tree he watched , and kept the neighbor 's fat orange cat away from . He closed the door and went to the kitchen table and sat down . Dishes were pushed to one side , and the day 's mail , full of bills and advertisements , was on the table , too , and as he flipped through , he found it . He found it and knew instantly why she had called him . It was a travel brochure on Nantucket , and there was a petition  --  " Petition for Nantucket Vacation " was written across the top of a piece of paper  --  signed by Louise and John Joel and Mary . They were asking to be taken to Nantucket . That was what it was all ( shout . The idea of packing bathing suits and going to Nantucket seemed more grotesque to him than setting off with snowshoes for Alaska . He put the brochure down , as shocked as if he had found a letter to Louise from a lover . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He meant to drive for a while and go back to the house , but he got lost , and then he found the Merritt Parkway , and it seemed more logical to go than to stay . He was speeding , watching the needle climb . And when he looked at the road again he realized where he was , how close to New York he was getting , and he pushed hard on the accelerator . There was toop228much wind at such a high speed , so he put his window halfway up . He was going to keep driving for a while , and then go back . He knew he was n't . He looked at his watch and wondered where so many hours had gone . He must have looked at the clock in the house wrong , or maybe his watch was wrong . A van with a plasticflower on the aerial passed him . A Honda Civic passed him . He was amazed that he was driving so slowly . He looked at the needle and saw that he was going thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fifty , sixty . He held it at sixty , watching the sky gradually lighten . And then he was in New York , and the light was even , and he did n't know what to do but start the usual routine . He took the car to the garage , he walked up the cement ramp to the street , and walked for miles before he thought to hail a cab . " Some son of a bitch threw up after I picked him up at Studio 54 , " the driver said . " I hope it does n't still stink back there . " " Have you been driving all night ? " he asked the cabbie . " Yeah . I been working eleven to eleven . Beat the heat . " He pushed a wad of money into the man 's hand and got out , in front of Nina 's building . He felt light-headed . He stood there and tried not to look like a crazy man or a drunk still stumbling from the night before . A woman with a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and a teenage girl dropped her eyes and quickened her pace . A garbage truck was out . It was going to be a hot , hazy day . Nina was right that he was a coward . How could he even admit to her what he had done ? He would have to call Louise with some excuse . He had an appointment to talk with the police . But he was not even in Connecticut . He was in New York , in front of Nina 's , and the trick was to get into the building and up the stairs . Child 's play : one foot in front of the other . Child 's play : bend your finger , pull the trigger . His son had shot his daughter.  |p229HE  WAS TRICKED . Parker set him up for it . After refusing to go into the city with John Joel , Parker called , suspecting , no doubt , that John Joel would n't go alone . They talked for a while on the phone about trying to get a ride to the movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand half the movie , but if he did n't talk during it , he 'd explain what he did n't get afterward . John Joel 's mother was doing an errand for one of the hospitalpatients , though , so she could n't take them , and Parker 's mother had laryngitis . Parker had him hold the phone while he asked his mother if she was in bed because she was sick with something in addition to laryngitis , or whether she could get up and take them to the movies . Parker 's mother had written : " You do n't have a sympathetic bone in your body . " Parker suggested calling Frankie Wu . Wu 's mother did n't work , and when they got to the theater , they could ditch Wu and meet him outside when it was over . John Joel said that was n't a good idea . Parker said , " Ah , you pansy . " When they hung up , John Joel went into the living room , sprawled in the chair , and got a comic to read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pig Fig , and it showedp230pigs being fed into a giant machine that ground them into pulp , and pig-faced bakers molding the pulp into the nearly round shape of a fig . " So are you going to flunk summer school ? " he said to Mary as she walked into the room to get her purse . She had her tablet and her book in her hand . She picked up her purse , pretending not to hear him . " Think I 'll go to New York today and have some fun , " he said . Mary was doing something in the kitchen . She was humming a Linda Ronstadt song , getting something out of the refrigerator . " Wan na make me another breakfast ? " he said , following her into the kitchen . " You need it , " she said . " You look like a breakfast . You know which part ? The sausage part . " She jabbed her finger into the roll of fat above his Bermuda shorts . A pain shot through his stomach . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuzz Scuzz . " Parker had taught him that insult . Somebody that made you itch to look at them was a Fuzz Scuzz . He said it to her again , curling his fingers and making a face . " How old are you ? " she said . " Ten ? " " Daddy and Nick and I had lunch in New York , " he said . " You 've never had lunch with Daddy in New York , have you ? " " If Daddy really wanted to see you , he 'd live here , " Mary said . She got a Tab out of the refrigerator . " You 're probably why he does n't , " she said . " He ca n't stand you . " " I hear you 've got a crush on Lloyd Bergman , " he said . " Somebodywhose brother was at that party you and Angela went to told me . Want to know who ? " " No , " she said . She opened the Tab , took a sip . " Frankie Wu 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him ? " John Joel pulled the skin at the corner of his eyes , making them into slits . " You do n't look as ugly that way , " she said . " Are you the homeliest girl in summer school ? " he said . " Beat your meat , " she said . She slung her purse over her shoulder and picked up the can of Tab , clutched her books under her arm . She was carrying a lot of stuff , and he watched her , hoping she'dp231drop something going out the door . She walked very close to the door and opened it with a stiff flick of her wrist . She went out , and he heard the slow hiss as the door closed behind her . As usual , she had topped him with an insult he did n't understand . It reminded him that he was hungry and had n't eaten for two hours , since his mother fixed him breakfast . He opened the refrigerator , saw that there was hamburger meat , and took out the package , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a lump of butter in a pan and turned on the stove . When the butter sputteredinto liquid , he pressed the hamburger into the pan . It was ten o'clock . She was late for school , and he was surprised that she was going . His mother had stalked out of the house , after callingMary three times and getting no response . Mary 's breakfast was still on the table . The eggs had congealed . The toast was all buttery shine . The bacon looked fine . He picked up a piece and ate it . As the hamburger cooked , he ate the other two pieces . He was finishing the hamburger when Parker called again . " What do you want ? " he said to Parker . " I want you to come over . I want to show you something . " " What have you got that I have n't seen ? " " What are your big plans for the day ? " Parker said . " I 've got about a dozen comics you have n't seen , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got sick . She 's going out , anyway . Somebody just called her , and she 's getting dressed . " " I thought she was sick . " " Listen , " Parker said , " I 'm not going to beg you . " He hung up . John Joel took his last bite of hamburger and put the plate in the sink . He went outside and ran across the lawn , after a bird that was pecking in the grass . The bird flew away , and he watched it go , higher and higher , until it landed in the peach tree . The peaches got about half the size of peaches in the store , then turned gray and dropped from the tree . Mary had put one in his bed , and when he showed his mother , she had yanked Mary by one arm into the room and made her pick up the peach , which had burst , and throw it away . Then she had made Mary strip the bed and wash the sheet in the laundry tub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long time . It was also the first time he had seen his mother and Mary crying together . While they were downstairs , he hadp232taken his mother 's little manicuring scissors and carefully cut the threads for about two inches along the seam of Mary 's jeans , in the crotch . He tugged , to make sure the seam had come apart . When he tugged , a couple of tiny threads he had missed burst . Parker had taught him that trick . He did it to his mother 's tennis shorts . " You can do too much or too little , " Parker said . " Cutting this much is about right . Do n't tug at the seam , and it 'll open gradually . It 'll open while she 's playing tennis . " Parker had his own scissors . He had scissors in about six sizes , that his grandmother had given him because he told her he was interested in paper cutting . Parker had cut a butterfly shape out of a piece of paper and sent it to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His grandmother had sent a small knife that had belonged to his grandfather that seemed never to go dull . Parker used that knife for fraying upholstery . John Joel climbed up in the tree , saying " shit " when he scraped his leg . He weighed more than he had at the beginning of summer , and it was hard to bend his leg as sharply as he needed to to haul himself up on one of the branches . When he got to the limb he usually sat on , or stretched out on , he settled himself and examined the scrape on his leg . It was n't bad . It was n't bleeding . He clamped his hand over it and hoped the pressure would stop the stinging . There was nothing to do . He stared at the big bumblebees hoveringaround the abelia , and wished that there were some way to blindfold Mary and lead her into the bush . He looked at the lot between their house and Angela 's . Some butterflies flew up from the brush . It was a sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was also hungry . He swung his legs back and forth , too lazy , after just having climbed into the tree , to work his way down and go back to the kitchen for more food . He thought about Parker 's mother 's orange cake . He had eaten a piece of that cake before . There were thin rounds of orange on the top , around the edge , like little wheels on their sides . When Parker 's mother was making bread , or a souffle , Parker would go into the kitchen , if she was on the second floor , and jump hard outside the oven . He did n't do anything to ruin her orange cakes . His mother had stopped making bread . Most of her energy now went into making orangep233cakes that were perfectly shaped , tall , beautiful . John Joel watched a bird hopping around on the grass . The bird did n't know he was up in the tree . " Meow , " he said , drawing the word out , speaking in as high a pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it again . The bird flew a few feet forward , continued to hop along the grass . Only when John Joel started to climb down from the tree did it fly away . He hated to have nothing to do but hang out with his mother or go to Parker 's . For a while he put it off , flipping through comics he had already looked at three or four times , and Pig Fig was really the only funny one . He flipped through that one again , then picked up the comics and decided to return them to Parker and have a piece of orange cake . He remembered to lock the door when he went out , and to leave the key under a big shell that was in among his mother 's iris . He would have liked for Mary to have forgotten her key and be locked out , but she 'd probably go to Angela 's until dinner anyway , and if his mother came home and saw that he 'd left the back door open , he 'd catch hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Joel rang the bell , and knocked on the door and yelled Parker 's name . Finally , he heard Parker , in no special hurry , coming to answer the door . " What ? " Parker said , opening the door . " I brought your comics back . " " Yeah , " Parker said . " You came for cake . " Parker stood aside , and he walked in . " I lied about the cake , " Parker said . " I do n't want any cake , " John Joel said . " I just wanted to return your comics . " " You want it , " Parker said . " There is one , too . Come in the kitchen . " He followed Parker into the kitchen . The wallpaper in the kitchen was blue , with a pattern of white chickens , columns of half-inchhighchickens . There was a long plate-rail across one wall , where Parker 's mother kept her collection of old plates with animals and farm scenes . There was a blue tablecloth on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parker lifted up the salt shaker and took it to the sink . Ile put his finger under the water ,  |p234and  let a single drop of water hit the circle of tiny holes in the chicken 's head . Then he dried it off and put it back on the table . He got a knife out of a drawer , and two plates . He cut two pieces of cake : a large one for himself , and a medium one for John Joel . He got two Cokes out of the refrigerator , and shook John Joel 's can lightly , three or four times , before he grinned and handed it to him . John Joel let it sit there . He only cared about the cake , anyway . And when his piece was gone , he was going to cut another one . He 'd like to see what Parker would do to stop him . They ate in silence . Parker thumbed through Pig Fig and laughed as he ate . John Joel finished first and picked up the cake knife , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icing onto his finger and licked it . " Come on upstairs , " Parker said . " I want to show you some-thing . " He had already seen what Parker had to show : the two green fishing tackle boxes , with his grandfather 's things in them . " Why 'd you bring them upstairs ? " John Joel said . " Just felt like it , " Parker said . " He 's away on a trip . He 's not going to know . If she finds them , serves her right for snooping in my room . Let her find them . I 'd like to see her face . " Parker took out the pen with the little lady that did the striptease . " Hey , Parker , " he said . " I saw that . " " It 's neat , " Parker said , handing him the pen . " It got screwed up and he does n't hit her right . You think there 's somebody who repairs pens like this ? " Parker tilted it , smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aim is off . " Parker put the two boxes on his bed . He lifted the ties out again , and put them in a pile . He had something small in his hand that John Joel could n't see . " Reach out , " Parker said . " For what ? " " Because I said to . You scared I 'm going to blow you up or something ? " " What have you got ? " " Jesus , are you an infant , " Parker said . " Go to shake hands with me . Come on . " John Joel put his hand out . It was sticky from the cake.  |p235Parker  's hand came forward , and John Joel saw a thin ring of metal around Parker 's middle finger , and then something hard pressed into the palm of his hand . It was a palm buzzer . Parker took it off and showed John Joel the small circle of metal with a bulge in the middle that made a loud buzzing sound when pressure was put on it . Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box and pulled some comics out from under his bed . He flopped onto his stomach and started to read one . John Joel went to the bathroom . He undid the button at the top of his shorts , and pulled his shirt out , to be more comfortable . He ran the cold water and wiped his wet hand over his face , patted his face dry on somebody 's towel . IIe felt even stickier . He went back to Parker 's room , thinking about asking for more cake . He and Parker read comics . Parker got up from the bed and touched his toes . " Bet you ca n't , " he said to John Joel . John Joel was pretty sure he could n't . He ignored Parker . He ran his tongue over his teeth and thought how much he did n't want braces . Parker had a magazine about dentists  --  a picture book , on cheap paper that almost fell apart when you touched it , so Parker turned the pages carefully , like the pages of a rare book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and there were pictures of women with their eyes like pinwheels and their legs spread , dentists pressed against their crotches , bending over and probing into their mouths . The writing in the magazine was all in some foreign language , but the people in the pictures looked like Americans . " You should have seen Marathon Man , " Parker said . " Ask your orthodontist if he saw that . " After a while , when John Joel said he was going home , Parker got up and offered him another piece of cake . They went to the kitchen and Parker cut two slices , this time even more unequal in size , and flopped them onto the same plates they had eaten off before . The morning paper was on the table , and there was a picture of Rosalynn Carter standing with some foreign woman . " Dumb hag scumbag , " Parker said , examining the paper . He turned the picture of Rosalynn Carter face down on the table and picked up his piece of cake and ate it out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , andp236when John Joel turned around Parker would puff out his cheeks and waddle . " You 're so thin yourself , " John Joel said . " Let 's see you touch your toes , " Parker said . Parker picked up a rock and threw it at a squirrel . When a car came down the road , he zigged and zagged , so that the car did n't know if he was going to run out in front of it or not . John Joel did n't know how Parker could do things like that : What if the person in the car knew him , or his parents ? Parker picked up anotherrock and threw it at a tree . It hit the tree and rebounded , and John Joel ducked . Parker laughed . " You 're a real asshole , " John Joel said . He saw his mother 's car in the driveway and was secretly glad that he could get rid of Parker . Parker would n't hang around if his mother was there . " I want to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , " John Joel said . Parker pulled the small black gun out of his pants pocket . " Get that out of here , " John Joel said . " If my mother sees that , both of us are going to catch hell . " " What , " Parker said , " there 's a law against it ? " " There is , " John Joel said . " There 's a law . " " What 's it called : the Scaredy Baby 's Law ? Come on . I want to show you something . " He could n't go in the house with Parker carrying the gun , and Parker would n't put it away . " Come on , " Parker said , walking to the back of the lawn . Parker climbed the tree . John Joel climbed behind him . He wished that his mother knew he was home , that she would call him . He hoped she might look out the kitchen door and see him . She had put on the sprinkler , and it was turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetting the abelia bush . The bees hoveredanyway , jerking back from the spray , a few flying forward , into the soaking bush . Some bees hung to the wet bright-green branches , clustered almost like Japanese beetles , even though the water kept raining into the bush . " What do you want now ? " John Joel said.  |p237On  cue  --  exactly on cue  --  John Joel saw Angela and Mary , walking into the field . " Pshew ! Pshew ! " Parker said , aiming the gun at a bird hopping by the tree . " Wait 'll you see Moonraker , when all those guys floating in space get zapped by lasers . " " Put that away , " John Joel said . " You 'll scare her . If she sees you with that , it 's going to get me in trouble with my mother . " John Joel stared at Parker . " I mean it , " he said . " I 'm telling you . " " Do n't talk to me like that , " Parker said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the gun in his right hand , and John Joel , on his left , could n't think how to get it away from him . " You are really stupid , " Parker said . " You think I 'd carry a gun around that had a bullet in it ? That would make a lot of sense , would n't it ? If you 're so scared , you can hold on to it , so I do n't blow your sister away , " Parker said , handing him the gun . " You love your sister ? You fall in love with your sister ? " " I hate her , " John Joel said . Angela waved and turned back toward her house . Mary walked forward , jumping over something , zigzagging because she knew the path to take to avoid poison ivy . If his mother saw her in the field , Mary would catch hell . He hoped that his mother would come out into the backyard and see her . Mary did n't see them in the tree , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring them . A bird flew away as she was almost out of the field . She turned and flicked something off the back of her jeans . Something small fell back into the field , a burr or a bug . He called her name , and pulled the trigger , because he thought that Parker had been telling the truth . He did n't even have the gun aimed , and still he hit her.  |p238Tiffy  lifted the slice of lemon out of her glass of iced tea and let tea drip into the glass . She sucked the lemon , put it on the table next to the glass . " I never thought about it until last night  --  it never struck me as strange in any way , because I 'm so conditioned . I 'm so slow to come around to understanding some things . Think about it : The fairy godmother changes a pumpkin into a coach , mice into horses , a rat into a coachman , lizards into footmen , and work clothes into a silver and gold dress , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball ? To be back at midnight . If she had the power to do all those other things , did she really lack the power to make them last past midnight ? It 's just another story about virginity . You 've got to read My Mother , My Self . Nancy Friday ca n't be wrong . " Ti ffy sucked on the lemon . " Interesting , too , that she does n't transform anything into glass slippers  --  that she touches her magic ring to Cinderella 's work clothes to turn them into fine threads , but the glass slippers are just brought forward , as if they always existed . Do you know what Freud says about shoes ? " Then they heard the shot . They both knew it was a shot , butp239Louise said to Tiffy , " What was that ? " and Tiffy said what it was . They got up from the table together , and Louise heard another sound , the sound of Tiff y 's glass turning over . She looked back at the table and saw Tiffy reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale-brown puddle was washing over Perrault 's Fairy Tales . Louise stared stupidly . She was afraid to look , because she knew what it was . She knew that something horrible had happened , because there had been no sound before the shot , and no sound after it was fired : It just existed in itself , strange and loud , and then there was nothing but whatever it was she was going to see when she got to the door . The door was closed  --  Tiffy had suggested that , saying that the kitchen would be cooler with the fan going and the door closed , that the screen door let in more hot air than .. . While she was thinking , Tiffy passed her and threw open the door.  |p240CYNTHIA  HAD talked to Bobby on the phone , and now she was talking to him in person . Spangle 's old friend had become a writer , and he was on his way to New York to talk to agents . That did n't delight him , but as he talked he found more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bagels  --  he could get bagels there . Bookstores  --  he might be able to find a copy of Thomas Wolfe 's book about writing a novel at a bookstore he 'd heard about off Broadway at 95th . He had heard that a copy was there , and the stupid friend who 'd told him  --  his friend Honig was so stupid he could n't believe it  --  he 'd told Honig to look for the book , and Honig had n't realized that he had meant he should also buy it . Used-clothing stores -- they might have a cowboy shirt similar to one he had lost , with a satin skull that looked as if it had been drawn by Georgia O'Keeffe sewn over the pocket . " How did you lose a shirt ? " she said . " I was at the laundromat and I think somebody saw it going into the washing machine and pulled it out when I left to buy a newspaper . That 's all I can think . I 've lost shoes , because I 've forgotten I was wearing them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walk back to the car not thinking about shoes  --  but I ca n't thinkp241myself how else I could have lost the cowboy shirt .

He had a huge foot , and he was wearing bright-orange running shoes with a white stripe curving around the side . " Ca n't wear these to teach in , " Bobby said . " Got to get shoes . What else is there to buy besides cowboy boots for shoes ? Some goddamn old man 's shoes that lace up ? Jesus , do I hate to think about teaching . " " When does the semester  --  " she said . " Hey ! " Bobby said , before she finished her sentence . " Excuse me for breaking in , but when I think of something , if I do n't say it , I lose it . " He took off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail of his shirt . " I forgot what I was going to say , " he said . " Were you going to say something about teaching ? " " Oh , " he said . " Right . Right . I was going to ask you about Yale . You said you 're at Yale . " " I do n't even want to think about it . I just want a vacation . All I want is a rest , and for this heat wave to break . " " Where did I say that bookstore was ? " Bobby said . " Broadway and 95th . " " God ! " Bobby said . " If you had n't remembered , I would have lost it just like that . " He snapped his fingers . They did n't make any sound , because his hands were wet . He was drinking beer , and the can was sweating . Bobby kept wiping his hand on his denim shorts . " What are they going to do , come into my classroom and carry me out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crease down the front ? These are my shoes , you know ? " Bobby held up his big puffy orange foot .

Bobby 's **30;6788;TOOLONG were being decided , he could not refrain . Very softly he said , I 've been wrestling . . . for many days . . . I 've been away , you know , in the fields mostly .. And what did you decide ? ' his father asked . Hilary rose and slowly moved among the oaks , coming back to stand before his mother . I 'm to be a missionary , ' he said . God has called me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . But where ? ' Wherever God sends me , ' he replied , and again he reddened as his brothers gathered to congratulate him . I 'm going overseas , too , ' David broke in . You 're what ? ' his father cried . I 'm emigrating . Four chaps I know in London . . . we 're off to Amer-ica . ' Good God , those rebels ! ' It 's a settlement scheme . Ohio , some place like that . I 'm sailing next month . ' Good God ! ' his father repeated , aghast at the prospect of a son of his in such a wilderness . David , ' he said seriously . We 'll be at war with those rebels within a year . As soon as I get to Parliament , I 'm to vote for war . The Proprietor said so . ' ' I 'll be fighting your troops somewhere in Ohio , wherever that is . ' When will you be back home ? ' Emily asked . It 'll take some years to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slaves hoeing the cotton , and all that . But I 'll be back . ' You must never take arms against England , ' Josiah said gravely . You 'd be shot for a traitor . And there will be war . ' Father , America 's a sovereign nation . Do n't send a lot of silly troops like Richard  --  ' Brother against brother ! ' Richard cried . Would n't that be jolly ? ' So under the oak trees at Sentinels in the County of Wiltshire the Saltwoods reached decisions on the destinies of their sons . Peter , who had brains , would take charge of the family business . Hilary , who had character , would go into the ministry . Richard , who had courage , would enter the army . And young David , who had neither brains , nor character , nor courage , would emigrate to America . The shock caused by Hilary 's announcement that he intended becoming a missionary instead of a proper clergyman grew into a firestorm when his family learned that he proposed joining the Missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dissidents , and more especially , the radical Congregationalists . You 'll ruin your prospects , ' his mother warned , but he was adamant , assuring his family that when he reported to the training headquarters at Gosport , not far from Salisbury , he would not be required to convert to the rebellious faith . I 'll serve my time with Jesus overseas and come back to Salisbury , ' but even as he promised this he announced that he was not going to be a part-time missionary but one wholly dedicated to the cause : I 've elected to go for a complete theologicalp301education , terminating with ordination as a full-fledged minister . ' His father , now in Parliament and a resident of London , encouraged him in this decision : In for a penny , in for a pound . Choose the highest possible , because one day , when this missionary foolishness is over , your mother and I expect to see you dean of Salisbury Cathedral . ' At tea one afternoon , during the later stages of his training , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the Proprietor has promised most faithfully that when you 're through and safely back in the Church of England , he plans to exert every influence for your assignment as dean of the cathedral . ' Hilary 's brothers approved heartily : We could sit here under the oaks and look across the meadows and tell each other , " That cathedral 's in good hands . " Do hurry and finish with the savages , wherever you go . ' He would have made a flawless dean , tall , slightly stoop-shouldered , his head bent a little forward as he walked along the cloisters , as if he were looking for something a few yards ahead , diffident , rather brilliant in his studies and of deep conviction religiously . He should have stayed at home , progressing from one small living to another until his reputation as a sound young man was established , then moving into the larger positions from which he would write two incomprehensible books . Such books were a prudent step in English advancement ; no one bothered to read them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made . And in due course , fortified with credentials from the noble houses of the county , including the Proprietor 's , he would move on to professor at Oriel and then the deanship . What had interrupted this pleasant , routine progression ? Hilary Saltwoodhad religious insights far deeper than those of the ordinary Oxford graduate , and he had paid attention to those ringing commandments of Paul in the New Testament in which young men were charged with the duty of spreading the gospel . Indeed , his favorite book in the Bible was Acts , in which the birth of a new religion , and especially of a new church , was portrayed so vividly . With Paul he had traveled the Holy Lands and penetrated to those surrounding nations which knew not Jesus and where Christianitybegan as an organized religion . He felt a deep affinity with Paul , and a thorough knowledge of Acts prepared him for the Pauline letters that outlined the next steps in the spread of Christianity . His own discovery of Christ was less dramatic than Saul 's conversion into Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . He was not , like others he knew , turning to religion because as a second son he had nowhere else to turn ; the church was by no means his secondary choice . Long before his father had been nominated for Parliament he had been on the verge of announcing his commitment to Jesus , and would have done so regardless of his family 's fortunes . His conversion was deep if not spectacular , and he enjoyed the opening months of his ministerial education ; the London Missionary Society , as it was being called in some quarters , was becoming famous in various parts of the world , even though it had been in existence for barely a decade . Its stern , intense young devotees , coupled with the older , practical artisans , had penetrated to remote areas , often serving as the cutting edge of civilizationp302as it reached unsettled lands . The LMS was a revolutionary force of the most persistent power , but in his early months at Gosport , Hilary did not discover this . Instruction was principally in the propagational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , of Acts and the missionary letters of St. Paul . He enjoyed the abstract philosophizing and profited especially from the droning lectures of an older scholar who expounded the basic theories of the New Testament , instructing him in facts that sometimes surprised him : The Book of Acts is significant for two reasons . It was written by the same hand that gave us the Gospel According to St. Luke , and that unknown author is extremely important because he is probably the only non-Jew to have composed any part of our Bible . All the other authors were rabbis like Jesus and St. Paul , or ordinary laymen like St. Matthew , the tax collector . In Acts we receive the first message about our church from a person like ourselves . ' But apart from knowledge , there was also deep conviction . These mature ministers truly believed that it was the duty of young men to go forth unto all the world ' to spread the word of God ; they were convinced that unless this word was taken to the remotest river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple English clergymen there was no predestination whereby all men were sorted out as either saved or damned ; such belief would make missionary work a futility . The Society taught that every human soul was eligible for salvation , but this could be attained only if some missionary could instruct it . The task was to deliver Christ 's precious message to savages who were in darkness , and few young Englishmen of this period who absorbed that teaching ever doubted that they personally could bring this salvation . There was much prayer , and many learned discussions as to how salvationmight be conveyed , and crude geography lessons outlining the problemsto be encountered in Africa or the South Seas , where the young men were to go . It was studious and pious and soporific . But when Reverend Simon Keer , after having served four years on the frontier , burst into headquarters , every aspect of Hilary Saltwood 's life was altered . Keer was a Lancashire activist , son of a baker and lacking a university education . He was a short , round man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red hair and a pair of wire spectacles that he kept shoving back onto the bridge of his nose . His station had been South Africa , a land that Hilary had scarcely heard of ; vaguely he knew that through some accident or other a vast area had fallen under English rule . The students were spellbound when Keer , bounding up and down like the bobbin on an active line , launched his impassioned speeches : There is a land down there in our care which cries for the word of God , a land of black souls thirsting for redemption . Lions and hyenas ravage these people by night , slavery and corruption by day.  |p303We  need schools , and hospitals , and printing presses , and trusted men to teach farming . We need roads and proper houses for these children of God , and dedicated men to protect them from cruel abuse . ' After he had listed another dozen things the natives required , one young man whose father was a butcher asked , Do n't we need churches , too ? ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassioned oratory , Of course we need churches . ' But in the days that followed he never again mentioned any need for them . Instead , he captivated his eager listeners by his explicit accounts of what it was like to be a missionary : I landed at Cape Town with my Bible and my dreams , but before I preached my first sermon I traveled three hundred miles over almost impassable mountains , across arid lands and up and down ravines where there was no road . I lived for weeks with white men who spoke not a word of English and black men who knew nothing of Jesus Christ . I slept on the barren veld with only my coat to cover me and ate food that I had never seen before . The first task I was called to perform was aiding the birth of a baby girl , whom I baptized . The first service I conducted was under a thorn tree . When I finally reached my post I was alone , with no house , no food , no books and no congregation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches I conducted my second service . Young men , in South Africa a thousand thorn trees wait to serve as your cathedrals . ' He had an overpowering effect upon the young dreamers of the LMS , for with his exhortations to face the practical problems of the world he combineda devout conviction that what he had done , and what they must do , was missionary work over which God exercised a personal supervision . Again and again he cited those stirring commands issued by St. Paul when he struggled with his frontiers , and as he lectured , the reality of the New Testament materialized before the eyes of his listeners . It was not till the third week of his fiery declamation that he began to confide the real problem that had brought him back to London . In his preliminary lectures he had disposed of the physical world of the missionary and in subsequent ones he had treated knowingly the theological basis of conversion . Now he sought to instruct his future replacements in the reali-ties : I care not whether you have planned to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastelands of Canada . I care not what commitments you have made to your parents or your ministers here . We need you in Africa , and I implore you to dedicate yourselves to the salvation of this continent . Especially do we need you in our new colony , for nowhere else on earth are the challenges to Christ 's teaching more clearly dictated . A dozen men like you , dedicating your lives to the task , can set patterns for a new nation . '  |p304Whenever  he spoke on this theme , and he returned to it constantly , he became like a man possessed of special insights : his voice soared ; he seemed to become taller ; his eyes flashed . He was engaged in a kind of spiritual Armageddon and conveyed his thundering sincerity to any listener . In the fourth week , after a series of such flights , he told the young missionaries what the great problem was : Slavery ! The Dutch who have occupied the Cape for a hundred and fifty years are among the finest people on earth . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland . They tithe ; they listen to their predikants ; they support their churches ; but they have fallen into the great evil of slavery . For generations they have been owners of imported slaves , and now the wonderful brown and black people with whom they share the land they also hold in cruel bondage , and it is our solemn , God-given mission to rescue all these souls from that bondage . If you join me in this task , and I pray that you will , you must expect that men will revile you , and misrepresent your motives , and even threaten you with bodily harm . But you will persist . And God will strengthen you , and in the end we shall build an English nation of which God will be proud . ' In the fifth week , realizing that he had been painting too somber a picture of the missionary 's life in South Africa , he stopped ranting , and began to amuse his listeners with affectionate stories of his life there , using an exaggeratedNorth Country dialect : Half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie-yon , but he 's retreating from the sunrise . You learn to know that by the manner in which his voice rrrrecedes . Comes a knock on your tent , and it 's the little girl informing you that her baby sister is about to be born and Mother says can you hurry . There are days on the veld with hunters and nights under the starrrrs with more lie-yons and protea flowers , bigger than your mother 's washbasin . ' What the young men never forgot , however , were the two brief sermons Keer delivered in the Kaffir language  --  in them they heard for the first time the click sounds which the Xhosa had borrowed centuries before from the Hottentots . He explained to them that he had mastered the language in order to compile a dictionary , from which a translation of the Gospels for the Xhosa would soon be made . His first sermon dealt with the Good Samaritan , and since he played all the roles , dancing about the stage , his red hair flying , and since he altered his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the missionerscould easily follow the story without understanding the words . But his second sermon dealt with Christ 's love for all people , and now there were no clues to its meaning except the overwhelming conviction that filled the room when he stood on his toes , eyes closed , deep voice throbbing with the repeated words Jesus Christ . As he reached the climax of his preachment a hush fell over the room , and when the last click sounds had echoed , Hilary Saltwood knew that hisp305destiny lay in South Africa . Waiting till the other students had left the room , he stepped forward to the podium , but before he could speak , ReverendKeer jumped down and held out his hands : ' Laddie , you 've decided to join the Lord 's work in Africa ? ' ' I have . ' ' God be praised . ' That night , after he had written explanatory letters to his parents , he felt an enormous sense of having been set free . He had been impelled toward this decision both spiritually and intellectually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's miracle that sent Simon Keer at this particular time , and Hilary thanked Him for that with a full heart . But before he fell asleep a most curious reflection flashed across his mind : In all the time I 've been here , I 've rarely heard the Old Testament mentioned . We 're men of the New Testament , the personal followers of Jesus and St. Paul .. . When Hilary completed his studies , Parliament was not in session , so before sailing for South Africa he returned to Sentinels on Salisbury Plain , and there he sat under the oak trees with his parents and his two brothers . Peter was now in full charge of family affairs and spent half his time on them , the other half devoted to the interests of the Proprietor . Richard had his commission in the Wiltshire regiment and was on leave prior to embarking for India ; he joked that when he was a general he would stop off at Cape Town to meet with his brother , the bishop . Their father did not appreciate such remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was serve routine time as a missionary , then hurry back to enter competition for the deanship of the cathedral : ' When a young fellow has backing as strong as the Proprietor 's , and as vigorous .. One day the entire family went for a picnic at Old Sarum , where Josiah showed them the ancient elm under whose noble branches he had been elected to Parliament , and the older Saltwoods remained there while the three brothers climbed the low hill to view the ruins . It was both remarkable and moving that they could pick out the lines of those very old buildings which represented a heroic age of England , but after the first moments they paid scant attention to the ruins , for this was a cloudy day , and while they were standing among the fallen rocks a portion of the sky cleared , allowing great shafts of light to fall upon Salisbury to the south , and there the cathedral stood , bathed in radiance , a most noble monument , perhaps the finest in all England , situated on its almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , outlined in the same accidental light , the three clumps of trees at Sentinels . ' Oh , look ! ' Peter cried . ' It 's a signal ! ' ' For what ? ' Richard asked . ' For us . For us Saltwoods . ' Grasping the hands of his brothers , he cried in excited syllables , ' Wherever you go , you 're to come back here . This is always to be your home . ' Richard said , somewhat gruffly , ' It looks a far distance from India . ' Peter ignored his brother 's dampening comment and asked , in a flush of emotion , ' Hilary , will you say a prayer for us ? '  |p306It  seemed a most natural thing to do when three brothers , who had shared an old house beside a river of heavenly beauty and in the shadow of a great cathedral , were parting : Dearest God , Thy home is everywhere . Ours is here . Let us cherish both . ' Damned fine prayer , Hilary , ' Richard said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their father proposed a more serious expedition , one that would require horses and considerable preparation . You 'll be gone for some time , ' he said to Hilary and Richard . I 've spoken to the Proprietor and he wants to come along . Says it may be his final visit . ' To where ? ' Peter asked . Their father had a welcome surprise . Through the centuries when Saltwoodssent their sons to Oxford , the boys invariably went by carriage north through Wiltshire and then easterly through Berks , a route that carried them past one of the noble monuments of the world , and generations of the family had come to look upon this place as symbolic of their fortunes , so that occasionally , when no lad had gone north to university for some decades , the Saltwoods would convene and go that way without excuse , simply to renew their acquaintance with Stonehenge . The monument lay only eight miles north of Salisbury , and a visit could be completed within a day , but the Saltwoods liked to pitch a tent there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient stones . This expedition consisted of the Proprietor , still traveling by carriage , with the four Saltwood men on horseback and five servants following with tents , the food and the flagons of wine . The road was a rough one , not much traveled , since most people leaving Salisbury headed either east to London or west to Plymouth . Only the occasional scholar on his way to Oxford went north to Stonehenge , or someone headed to the port at Bristol or the towns in Wales . Toward the close of day Josiah said , I rather think that at the rise of the next hill we shall see it , ' and he told the boys to rein in their horses and allow the Proprietor to be in the lead when Stonehenge was first sighted . There they are ! ' the old man cried , and to the east on a small mound which caught the first rays of the rising sun and the last light of day stood the hallowed stones , some fallen , some leaning , some erect in the location they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an awesome place , and no Englishman conversant with his nation 's history could fail to be humbled upon approaching it . D' you think it was the Druids ? ' the Proprietor asked as the group surveyed the somber monument . It was here centuries before anyone heard of Druids , ' Josiah suggested . My own thoughts , ' the Proprietor said . Sturdy bastards , whoever they were . ' Hilary had always been enchanted by Stonehenge . He had seen it first as a boy of ten on a family excursion much like this . He had seen it again when he accompanied Peter to Oriel , and of course on his own travels to Oxford . It was timeless , old beyond counting when Jesus was born , and it reminded men of the long sweep of history and the periods of darkness . The stones turned red as the sun dipped to its horizon , shimmering in the fading light.  |p307'We  'll pitch the tents over there , ' the Proprietor suggested , and that night they slept within the shadowed circle . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abusing his servants for not having lighted candles . I want to see the sun striking it , ' he grumbled , and as the Saltwoods joined him he said , ' I 'm sure they used to conduct human sacrifice here . At the solstices , anyway . Probably killed off two old men like me and three young virgins . Let 's go to the sacrifice . ' And they stood among the ancient stones , hauled here from sources far removed , as the sun broke upon them . ' D' you think you could offer us a prayer , Hilary ? ' the old man asked . ' Let us bow our heads , ' the new minister said , and as day came in earnest he prayed : ' God , Who marks our passage back to Salisbury and to India and to South Africa , and also to America where our brother hides , watch over us . Watch over us . ' The Proprietor said that while these were fine words , he would have appreciated some mention of the fact that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary uttered another short prayer , instructing God on this additional matter , and the old man was appeased . They spent that day inspecting the fallen rocks and making cautious guesses as to how old they might be , but as dusk approached , Hilary experienced a surge of religious emotion and moved apart from the others . Standing among the untoppled pillars , a gaunt , angular , stoop-shouldered figure who might well have been an ancient priest of this temple , he whispered , ' 0 God , I swear to Thee that I shall be as faithful to Thy religion as the men who erected these stones were to theirs . ' He landed at Table Bay one morning in the spring of i81o , expecting to be greeted by representatives of the LMS who would probably spend some weeks indoctrinating him in his duties and perhaps even accompanying him to his place of assignment . Instead , as soon as he stepped ashore he was grabbed by a sturdy Dutch farmer with very broad shoulders and full beard who asked in heavily accented English , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keer ? ' Modestly Saltwood conceded that he was , whereupon the farmer pushed him away , muttering , ' You ought to be ashamed , spreading lies . ' He was not allowed even one night 's rest in Cape Town , for at noon he found himself in a caravan of sorts heading eastward to a river on the far side of the mountains , where he had been directed to launch a mission . During the arduous journey he learned much about South Africa but even more about Reverend Keer , for wherever he stopped , people asked about the red-headed Lancashire man . The few Englishmen spoke of him with obvious regard , the many Dutchmen with unmasked contempt , and one night he asked an English missionary 's wife to explain this contradiction . ' Simple , ' she said . ' Simon Keer always stood up for the Hottentots and the Xhosa . ' ' Is n't that our duty ? To bring them to Jesus Christ ? ' ' Reverend Keer treated the Hottentots more like workmen in England.  |p308Always  fighting for their rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Things like that . ' Did the Dutch object ? ' She put down her cooking pans and turned to face Hilary . You must keep one thing in mind , if you 're to be an effective missionary . We English have been here four years . The Dutch have been here a hundred and fifty-eight . They know what they 're doing and they do it well . ' Keer says that what they do so well is slavery . ' She placed her two hands on Hilary 's and pleaded , Do n't use that word . Reverend Keer was given to exaggeration . He lacked education , you know . ' He 's translating the Gospels . ' Oh , he was excellent at identifying himself with the Xhosa . He could stay up all night transcribing their words . ' I thought it was my duty to do the same . ' To bring them Christ , yes . To become their advocate against the Dutch , no . You speak harshly . ' The Xhosa killed my son . They 'd have killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . ' And you stay ? ' It was an incident . We were at war and our troops had killed their people . Simple retaliation . ' Are n't you afraid ? ' I am , and you will be , too . And pray God that you do n't get caught up in it . ' As he penetrated farther into the country he became increasingly aware of how different the long-established Dutch were from the lately arrived English , and in his first letter home he shared his observations with his mother : The Dutch speak of themselves in three distinct ways . Those in the environs of the Cape call themselves Dutch , although many of them have never seen Holland or ever will . In truth , they speak harshly of the old country , holding in contempt those real Dutchmen who came out from Holland to lord it over the locals with sneers and assumptions of superior education . Some of these long-time Dutch have taken themselves a new name , for they are more of Africa than of Europe . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling now these Afrikaners are named Boers ( farmers ) . But farther east toward the lonely perimeter of the country , where the roughest of the Dutch dwell , they call themselves trekboers ( migrating graziers ) , which is appropriate , for they are constantly moving on with their herds , until I am reminded of Abraham and Isaac . My mission is to be established in the lands of those trekboers who have stopped their wanderings . At his next halt , where only Boers lived , Hilary received his harshest view of Reverend Keer : Arrogant , stupid man . Kept saying he loved the Xhosa and the Hottentots , but every action he took damaged them . '  |p309In  what way ? ' Made them dissatisfied with their lot . ' What is their lot ? ' At school in England , did they teach you the Book of Joshua ? ' I 've read it . ' But have you taken it to heart ? God 's story of how the Israelites came into a strange land ? And how they were to conduct themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new missionary knew little of Joshua , so the oldest farmer took down his huge Bible and slowly leafed the pages until he came to the familiar instructions , which he translated roughly for the newcomer : You shall not marry with the daughters of Canaan . . . You shall keep yourself apart . . . You shall destroy their cities . . . You shall hang their kings from trees . . . You shall block up their graves with stones , even to this day . . . You shall take the land , and occupy it and make it fruitful . . . One man of you shall chase one thousand of them . . . You shall keep yourselves apart . . . And they shall be your hewers of wood and your drawers of water . . . And all this you shall do in the name of the Lord , for He has commanded it . ' Closing the big book reverently and placing his hands upon it , he stared directly into Hilary 's eyes and said , That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructs us . ' There is another part of the Bible , ' Hilary said quietly , leaning his thin shoulders forward to engage the debate . Yes , your Reverend Keer preached quite a different message , but he was an idiot . Young friend , believe me , it is the ancient word of God Himself that we follow , and you will break your teeth in this country if you contradict it . ' Across the southern plains of Africa , wherever he stopped , Hilary found himself engaged in argument over the merits of Simon Keer , and the Boers were so forceful in their rejection of the little redhead that in his quiet moments Hilary began to read Numbers and Joshua , finding in them not only the passages which his first Boer mentors had cited , but scores of others which applied directly to the position of the Dutch who had come into this land like the Israelites of old , who had entered their land of Canaan . The parallels were so overwhelming that he began to see local history through Dutch eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission . The spot selected for him lay on the left bank of the Sundays River , four hundred miles from Cape Town . When he reached it , not a building stood , not a roadway existed . The river , suffering from drought , carried little water , and there were no trees . But the spot itself was congenial , perched on a broad bend of the river and graced with level fields acceptable to plowing . In the distance was a forest with an abundance of usable wood ; and at hand , enough stones to build a city . Hilary , visualizing what this bleak spot might become , named it from a passage in the twentieth chapter of Joshua , where God instructs His people to erect cities of refuge to which any accused could flee and be assured of temporary safety :  |p310And  on the other side Jordan . . . eastward they assigned . . . Golan ... that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither , and not die . . . until he stood before the congregation . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and when the last members of his caravan disappeared , leaving him majestically alone in the heart of a strange land , he prayed that he might be allowed to build well . The first night , as he lay on the ground close to his belongings , he listened to strange sounds , and the darkness of Africa assailed him with a wild discordance , a sense of awe and anticipation rather than fear . When he awakened at dawn , he found a group of brown people watching him , squatting on their haunches a hundred feet away . For months there had been rumors that a missionary was coming . Hilary beamed at the sight . Surely the Lord Himself had brought this little gathering into the arms of His servant Saltwood . Dusting himself off , he rose to greet them , overjoyed when one man spoke to him in broken English . We stay with you . We your people now . ' His name was Pieter , son of that Dikkop who had traveled with Mal Adriaan . It was ten years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away after a beating for eating a melon from the family garden . He had drifted from farm to farm , working just enough to avoid being classified as Vagrant Hottentot , ' which would allow his being assigned arbitrarily to any farmer who wanted him . In truth , Pieter was a , eyes firmly shut . But before sunset that first day the Hottentots had shown Hilary how to dig a foundation to keep out rain , and by the second nightfall they had cut enough saplings to frame out a dwelling . Hilary saw in his imagination how Golan should look : rows of huts facing each other , a meeting hall and a church to close off one end of the rectangle . He was pleased with the rapid growth of his little community  --  six Hottentots to forty within three weeks  --  and within a short time Hilary and his followers had the mud-and-clay walls of a mission church in place . Before the thatching of the roof was complete he preached a message of dedication inside the little structure . Having mastered several words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hottentot with its click sounds , he delighted his congregation by offering the benediction in their language . In the days that followed he heard members of the mission saying gravely to one another as they worked , Peace be unto you . ' Peace was a commodity almost unknown . Young Xhosa warriors persisted in raiding cattle from white men 's farms , and not long after Hilary 's first sermon English troops , fortified by a Boer commando , had launched a massive attack against the black men , driving twenty thousand of them back across the Great Fish River and liberating , as they phrased it , vast herds of cattle . The gallant leader of this rout would be honored by having a newborn town named after him : Grahamstown . Hilary was untouched by these events ; but it grieved him that after sixp311months he had not met one Xhosa , and he began to fear that he had made a mistake in locating Golan here . During his studies at Gosport he had imagined himself bringing Christianity to black savages , wrestling with their pagan beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by brown Hottentots , more than ninety in the huts that faced the rectangle , while all the Xhosa lurked far across the river , a gang of cattle thieves . In his reports to the LMS he called his flock my Hottentots , ' knowing that few were of the pure strain ; they ranged from light , yellow-skinned half-Malays to very dark half-Angolans . They were not inclined to hard work , and a distressing number loitered about the mission doing nothing . But Hilary always remembered the name he had given this place , Golan the refuge , and he believed that these mild and peaceable folk , ' as he wrote of them , merited all the sanctuary they could find . Many had come to him with terrible tales of beatings , chains , and years of labor without pay from Boers who made their lives a misery . Simon Keer 's impassioned indictment of the colonists echoed in his ears , and he saw it his duty to succor the weak . Even his hopes for the Xhosa soared when a black man finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east . He proclaimed himself to be a Christian , stating in halting English that he had been baptized by a missionary with red hair called Master Keer , ' and he indicated that his village contained several other blacks who had been converted by our dear little man who could speak Xhosa . ' His Christian name was Saul , and Hilary promptly sent him back to Xhosa lands to spread joyful news about Golan , and because of Saul , at the end of six months the mission was home to one hundred and forty Hottentotsand twenty Xhosa . The latter taught Hilary the traditions of their people , and he developed respect for the ease with which they adjusted to life at Golan . As he worked with them he found himself constantly referringtq the practical instructions he had acquired from young Simon Keer , rarely to the theological indoctrination of the older LMS clergymen . ' Missionarywork , ' Keer had predicted , is one-tenth disputation , nine-tenths sanitation . ' The first white man Hilary met was a Boer living at a remote spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sundays River from the Fish . He rode into Golan one afternoon , a tall , rough-clad , white-haired old man who looked like someone from the early books of the Bible , his beard trembling in the wind . Name is Lodevicus , ' he said in halting English . Lodevicus van Doorn . ' He had come to warn Hilary not to allow any Hottentots from the north to take refuge at Golan . Why not ? ' Hilary asked . They . . . my laborers . . . they signed papers , ' he growled , obviously disliking the necessity of speaking in a foreign tongue . They to work ... not pray . ' ' But if they come seeking Jesus Christ .. Lodevicus showed his irritation that Saltwood made no effort to addresshim in Dutch : ' If you here ... missionary . . . damnit . . . learn Dutch . ' ' I should ! I should ! ' Hilary agreed enthusiastically , but to continue theconversation it was necessary to find someone who had both languages ,  |p312which  put Lodevicus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency of a Hottentot . It was fortunate that Lodevicus did not recognize the melon thief , and insensitive to the impropriety , went on talking , with Pieter listening respectfully and saying ' Ja , Baas ' at least once a minute . Baas say , " His Hottentots not come seek Jesus . They run away from work his place . " ' Tell him that even so , if any of his workmen were to come seeking refuge with me .. No sooner had the interpreter started this sentence than Lodevicus interrupted . Baas , he say , " My goddamn workers come here , no trouble for you . I come gettim . " ' Tell him that if any Hottentot or Xhosa seeks Jesus Christ .. Once more Lodevicus issued a string of threats , only some of which the Hottentot bothered to repeat . So this first meeting between the Boer and the Englishman ended in disarray , with Lodevicus shouting as he remounted his horse that Saltwood was no better than that damned idiot Simon Keer . He sputtered what sounded like curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keer come back , he meet him with sjambok . ' Assure him that Reverend Keer is safely in London and will not be seen again in these parts . ' When this was delivered , Lodevicus directed the Hottentot to say , Damn good thing . ' As a Christian , Hilary could not allow his first acquaintance with a neighbor to end so poorly , and with a complete change of attitude he said to the Hottentot , Ask Mijnheer van Doorn if he will join us in evening prayer ? ' This sudden switch to the Dutch mijnheer softened the old man somewhat , but only for a moment , for he soon realized that the prayers would be conducted in English , whereupon he spat : I pray Dutch church . ' And with that he galloped off , even though night was almost upon him . And that was the way things stood between the mission station of Golan and the nearest white man to the north until the end of the first year  --  when the Reverend Simon Keer burst upon the South African scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making his name accursed . He did not appear in person , which was prudent , since he would have been whipped , but a booklet that he published in England did arrive by ship . It bore the pejorative title The Truth About South Africa , and was a compilationof accusations against the Dutch so horrendous that the civilized world , meaning London and Paris , simply had to take notice . It charged the Boers with having already killed off the Bushmen , annihilatingthe Hottentots , and beginning to abuse the Xhosa  --  expropriating their land , stealing their cattle , and killing their women and children . It was especially harsh in allegations that the Hottentots and Coloured brethren were being tricked into slavery and denied ordinary decencies . It was a blanket indictment , its charges so melodramatic that they might have been ignored had he not added one accusation which more than any other inflamed the Christians of England and Scotland :  |p313The  Boers refuse to allow their Hottentots to attend mission schools or to convert to that one true religion which could save their immortalsouls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to believe that their laborers have souls , and each day that dawns sees Jesus crucified anew in order for the Boer to gain a few more shillingsthrough the toil of these mild and peaceable people forced into a servitude worse than that of the true slave . Such charges ignited action throughout England , especially since that nationnow had responsibility for the governance of South Africa , and protests of the most vigorous force were launched . What made government interventioninevitable was Reverend Keer 's closing statement that he personally could indict a hundred Boers for forced enslavement , criminal abuse and even murder . When the four dozen copies of The Truth About South Africa reached the Cape and were distributed , with Dutch translations being rushed to the frontier , a sullen resistance developed . Even prospering townsmen in Cape Town and Stellenbosch who had clearly benefited from the English takeover protested that Keer had unjustly maligned the entire colony . And the frontier Boers ! Each man felt that he was being specifically accused , and wrongfully . Pamphlets were prepared , rebutting the absent missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's reputation . But the power of an inspired missionary to inflame English public opinion would always be great , and while at the Cape a few people were defending South Africa , in London a multitude called for action , and before long , commissions were on their way to the Cape to look into Keer 's charges , and the mournful day came when formal accusations had to be lodged against some fifty Boers , who were commanded to stand trial before judges who would circulate throughout the colony . The Black Circuit , this exhibition would be called , and in due course it would reach Graaff-Reinet , several days ' ride to the northwest , and there Lodevicus van Doorn would be tried for physically abusing his Hottentots , starving them and denying them the right to attend religious services . He was also accused of murder . Before the Black Circuit reached Graaff-Reinet , Lodevicus , convinced that no judge appointed by the English would accord a Boer justice , swallowedhis pride and rode back to Golan , where he found that Hilary could now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassionedconversation . All I ask , Saltwood , is that you come with me , now . Look at my farm . Talk with my Hottentots and slaves . ' ' I 'll not be party to this lawsuit . ' ' It 's not a lawsuit . It 's a charge of murder . ' ' And other things , if I hear correctly . ' ' And other things . Trivial things . And it 's those you must inspect . ' ' I 'm not a witness , Mijnheer van Doorn . ' ' All men are witnesses , Dominee . ' The sudden use of this Dutch appellation caught Hilary 's imagination , and he had to admit that in a situation so grave , all men were witnesses ,  |p314so  that even though Van Doorn had been an unpleasant man , if he now appealed for help , it had to be given . On the spur of the moment he said , I 'll ride with you , but I 'll not testify in court . ' No one asks you to , ' Lodevicus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary left for the north , finding a ride with Van Doorn a moving experience : These vast lands with no markings  --  how do you find your way ? ' The look of things , ' Lodevicus said , and Hilary thought : That 's what I 'm being asked to judge  --  the look of things . As in the days when Mal Adriaan wandered these lands with Dikkop , this Van Doorn and his English clergyman formed a bizarre pair , the first an old man with heavy frame and white whiskers , the second a tall and gawky young man with the open face of a child . They were unlikely associates , Boer and Englishman , with different heritages , different attitudes towardlife and vastly different religions , one Old Testament , the other New . Yet they were joined in a forced association that would prove , for better or worse , inescapable . When they entered the low hills that separated the mission station from the farm , a wholly new vista opened , the vision of a land immense in its dimensions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges , but ominously grand in the substantial mountains that rose to the north . They seemed to warn Saltwood : This is a greater land than you have envisaged . The challengesare vaster than Simon Keer defined . At the crest of the last rise Lodevicus reined in his horse and pointed down to a small valley hemmed on all sides by hills of varying height . It was as tight a little world as Saltwood had ever seen , a secure haven cut by a river which brought fruitfulness to the rolling fields . The river entered the area at an opening to the southwest , ran diagonally across the meadows and exited at a pass in the northeast . If ever a frontier settler had a farm that was secure , this was it . De Kraal , ' Van Doorn said gruffly but with evident pride . Safe place for keeping cattle . ' Have you cattle ? ' The Hottentots have taken our herds north to graze . But this kraal is for human beings . A nest within the hills . ' Hilary turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with meadows on the Salisbury Plain estimated that De Kraal ran five miles west to east and something less than three north to south . Making such calculations as he could , he said in astonishment , You have nine thousand acres down there . ' Yes , ' said Lodevicus . This is the land of the Van Doorns . ' And he rode down into his little empire as if he were Abraham riding a camel to Canaan . The three days Hilary spent at De Kraal were a revelation , for he was in an enclave removed from any outside influence and ruled by one man . It was into this fortress that English justice presumed to force its way . Lodevicus had a wife , of course , and Hilary was surprised when he met her , for she seemed not at all awed by her austere husband , even though he was at least thirty years older . Wilhelmina van Doorn was a big , amiable woman who obviously set the laws to be observed in her house . She had one son , Tjaart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own.  |p315De  Kraal had nine Madagascan and Angolan slaves , few by comparison with the intensively farmed vineyards near Cape Town , but it also had thirty-two Hottentot and Coloured workers and their families , some whose ancestors had become affiliated with the Van Doorn family generations ago . By law they were contract laborers duly registered at Graaff-Reinet ; whether they were de facto slaves was moot . No outside observer like Saltwood would be allowed to ascertain the facts . Thirty-two Hottentots ? ' Saltwood asked . Is n't that a lot ? ' They have to herd our cattle sixty miles north of here . ' Sixty miles ! Does n't that put them on other people 's land ? ' There are no other people . ' Lodevicus invited Saltwood to inspect every aspect of De Kraal , where the slaves and Hottentots ate and where they slept and worked . Since Hilary now understood much of the **35;6820;TOOLONG dialectspoken between master and servant , he was able to conduct his investigationswithout the interference of Van Doorn . He was especially eager to interrogate the Hottentots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly abusing them , but when the herders were brought in he found them a jovial lot who loved their horses and the open range . How much do you get paid ? ' he asked the lead man . Paid ? What is paid ? ' Wages . Money . ' ' We got no money . ' Not now , but how much does Mr. Van Doorn pay you ? ' He not pay nothing . ' Saltwood started again : You work ? Seven days a week ? How much do you get paid ? ' Baas , I no understand . ' So with great patience the missionary explained that everywhere in the world , when a man performed a certain task , like herding cattle .. . We like cattle . . . sheep . . . big land . ' ' But what do you get paid ? ' After many false starts Hilary discovered that they got paid nothing in cash . They did receive their clothes , and their horses , and their food , and when they fell ill , Mrs. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Kraal ? ' Hilary asked . Where would we go ? ' Three times Saltwood questioned the Hottentots , trying to ascertain whether they were in fact slaves , but he never reached a satisfactory answer , so he broached the subject with Van Doorn himself : Would you call your Hottentots slaves , like the Madagascans ? ' ' No ! No ! They can leave any time they wish . ' Have any ever left ? ' ' Why should they ? ' Hilary dropped this line of investigation , turning his attention to the slaves , whom he found to be in good condition but surly in manner , unlike the Hottentots who worked the free range . One of the Madagascan men showed scars , and when Saltwood inquired about them , he found that the man had run away , been recaptured and punished . ' Why did you leave ? ' he asked  |p316To  be free . ' Will you run away again ? ' Yes , to be free . ' Will you be punished again ? ' If he catch me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boer could not mask his disgust : He 's my slave . I paid good money for him . We ca n't let our slaves get the idea they can run away at will . Of course they have to be punished . ' You seem to have whipped him rather harshly . ' I disciplined him . ' When he saw how Saltwood flinched , he said sharply , Dominee , in the old days he 'd have had his nose cut off , his ears , one hand if he persisted . These are slaves , and they must be disciplined , as the Bible says . ' Apart from the Madagascan , the Van Doorn slaves and Hottentots showed evidences of good treatment , and Saltwood said so , whereupon Van Doorn confessed : We live at the edge of the world , Dominee . We spend years without seeing a predikant . We must have slaves to operate the farm . We must have Hottentots to run the cattle and sheep . We rely upon instructionsfrom God and the direction we receive from this . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his hands , and pried open the brass clasps , and saw the heavy pages within , and the one on which Van Doorns had for a hundred and fifty years kept their family records , he was awed by the simple righteousness of this frontier Boer , and knew that if Van Doorn asked him to be a witness at his trial in Graaff-Reinet , he would out of simple decency have to at least testify as to his character . He was little prepared for what Lodevicus asked him to do now : Dominee , we live alone , terribly alone . Would you baptize our grandson ? ' Saitwood stiffened . At the mission you refused to pray with me . ' I was a fool , ' the old man said . Wilhelmina , come in here ! ' The smiling Wilhelmina came into the room , bowed to the missionary , and stood with arms akimbo . Tell the dominee , ' her husband said . Tell himwhat I told you when I reached home . ' From where ? ' From the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that visit to the mission . ' When she stood bewildered , he said more gently , When I told you I had refused to pray with him . ' You said you were a damned fool , and you were . ' Smiling at the visitor , she started to retire , but her husband said , I 've asked him to baptize the boy , and he 's agreed . ' I do indeed , ' Hilary said , and the little boy , struggling with a puppy , was brought into the room , and water was provided by one of the slaves , and the solemn rite was performed . But as it ended , Reverend Saltwood noticed that the little girl who had fetched the water lingered , twisting her fingers in her gray dress , and it was in this sanctified moment that he met the child Emma , daughter of the Madagascan . She was ten that year , a bright child often perplexed by what she witnessed . Her face had that sooty-blackness which seemed almost blue , and was so attractive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're to be black , why not be really black ? ' Her face was composed of handsome interlocking planes , so that when she smiled , showing her white teeth , it broke intop317lovely patches of light and shadow . When she was six and living on the fare from which Lodevicus had purchased her parents , she had been instructec sketchily in Christianity by Simon Keer and had from him acquired a visior of a world somewhat different from the one the slaves knew . Now , as the Van Doorns took their baptized grandson out in the yard to resume pla3 with his puppy , she lingered to ask Reverend Saltwood , ' Can I come to you mission ? ' ' You are a slave , my child , ' he said softly . You belong to Baas . ' ' Baas , he follow me , cut off my nose ? ' ' You know he would n't do that . But you also know what happened to your father when he ran away . If you run away , you 'll be punished . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Suffer the little children to come untc me '  --  and he knew that he was being less than heroic in failing to support this child . But his reflections were broken by a shout from one of Var Doom 's Hottentots : ' Riders ! Riders ! From north ! ' A bailiff from the Black Circuit sitting at Graaff-Reinet had come to inform Lodevicus that he must appear before that court . ' For what ? ' the olc man blustered , whereupon the nervous little Dutchman who had joined the English service puffed out his chest and in faltering voice recited the charges : ' Enforced slavery of Hottentots . Abuse of slaves . Murder of slave . ' ' By God , I will destroy that judge , ' the old Boer cried , but the bailif whispered in rapid Dutch , ' Lodevicus Hammer , you have friends at Graaff Reinet . Many Boers owe their farms to you . You 'll never hang . ' ' But I 'm to be dragged into a Kaffir court .. ' Please , Lodevicus , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' It was humiliating , but the old fighter realized he must comply , so after giving orders to his son and bidding Wilhelmina farewell , he came to Saltwood and said humbly , ' Dominee , you must ride with me . ' Despite his earlier resolution , Saltwood now faltered , and asked weakly ' Why ? ' ' To testify . You 've seen me . You 've seen my slaves . ' ' But the charge of murder  --  ' ' Ask the slaves . ' And Lodevicus was so obviously shaken by his arres that Hilary wanted to help in some way . Certainly he could testify that b Boer standards , the De Kraal slaves and Hottentots were reasonabl3 treated , and he was willing to say so to the court , but he was not willinl to be called on to aid any man charged with murder . Van Doorn , see ing his hesitation and guessing as to its cause , said again , ' Ask them . So Hilary took the girl Emma aside . ' Do you know who God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a childish voice . ' And do you know what hell is ? ' ' Master Keer , he tell me . ' ' And do you know that if you do n't tell the truth , you will go to hell ? ' Master Keer tell me . ' ' The old baas , has he ever killed a slave ? ' The little girl 's dark face froze into a scowl , her soot-black feature : betraying her agitation . Finally she said , moving nervously from foot to foot , He beat my father . Sometimes he thrash my mother . But he never kil nobody . '  |p318Do  the slaves ever talk at night , Emma ? ' All the time . ' Do they ever speak of a killing ? Long time ago ? When the old baas angry ? ' No killing . ' Saltwood was impressed by the girl 's willingness to speak but also by her obvious fear , so he asked abruptly if she would fetch her parents , and when they appeared , as nervous as their daughter , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave ? ' They looked at each other , then at their daughter , after which the husband said , He beat me too much . He beat my wife sometimes . ' He showed Saltwood the scars that he had shown before . They were gruesome and deep . But has he ever killed a slave ? ' ' No . ' When he said this , his wife tugged at his shirt sleeve and they whispered for a while . What 's she saying ? ' Hilary asked Emma . About the other time . ' What other time ? ' And the father told in broken , agitated words that on another farm , where they had lived prior to being purchased by Van Doorn , the master had killed a slave , and had been arrested at the insistence of Simon Keer , and had been fined two pounds . Also , his right to own other slaves was taken away , which was why these Madagascans had been sold to De Kraal . There had been murder , but never by Van Doorn . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little girl . ' No . ' Then he does not know what hell is , either ? ' No , ' the girl said . But he knows what true is . There was no murder . ' Saltwood went to the door and called to Van Doorn : ' I 'll ride with you . ' The Black Circuit at Graaff-Reinet was an explosive affair . Inspired by Simon Keer 's incendiary reports , a score of indictments had been issued based on the accusations of missionaries , Hottentots and Coloureds , all charging the Boers with gross abuses . Granted , there had been serious evils : Hottentots had been forced to work on after their legal contracts had expired ; their women and children had been threatened with violence if they left ; slaves had been excessively flogged ; there had been murder . But many of the charges were wild , without foundation , so that what should have been a serious judicial inquiry became a shambles . The countrysiderallied so strongly in support of the Boers , and perjured itself so willingly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasonably honest frontiersmen like Lodevicus van Doorn were publicly humiliated by being forced to stand in the dock and answer to preposterous accusations . Three Hottentots were brave enough to testify against Van Doorn , but what they said was so chaotic that the court had to be suspicious , and when Reverend Saltwood stepped forward to defend him , the court had to be attentive . The verdict was Not guilty , ' but this absolved nothing , for thep319Boers who had been so abused by the English courts would never forget their humiliation . Thus the Black Circuit joined that growing list of grievances , some real , some fancied , which would be recited in every Boer family for the next century and a half . The English were mortified that one of their own ministers had given testimony enabling a Dutchman to escape punishment : ' He was guilty as sin , you know . Indictment said so . ' A rumor was floated that Saltwood had defended the Boer in anticipation of favors to come : ' Perjured himself , of course . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boers . ' It was agreed that Hilary Saltwood must be ostracized insofar as the English community at the Cape was concerned : ' From now on he 's the darling of the Boers . ' How wrong they were ! The Van Doorn  --  Saltwood armistice lasted only two days , for when they rode back to De Kraal , Wilhelmina van Doorn met them at the gate , crying , ' Lodevicus ! Emma 's run off . ' ' Get her back . ' ' We do n't know where she 's gone . ' ' Set the Hottentots tracking . They 'll find anything . ' Saltwood found it difficult to visualize that little child in her gray dress running anywhere , but if she was indeed gone , he was fairly sure why : ' Probably went to the mission . ' As soon as he uttered these words he knew they were ill-advised , for Van Doom 's look of petty irritation turned to one of hatred : ' She can not do that . ' ' But if she wants to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they need to know about Jesus . ' ' But , Mijnheer van Doorn  --  ' ' Do n't Mijnheer me ! ' ' Obviously , this child hungers for Jesus . It 's been four years since she heard about him and still she  --  ' ' Where did she hear about Jesus ? ' ' At the other farm . From Simon Keer . ' What a sad mistake to have spoken that name ! Van Doorn began shouting Dutch phrases so fast that Hilary could not follow , then jutting his white-whiskered face forward and growling , ' Any slave of mine has dealings with Simon Keer , I 'll beat her till she 's  --  ' He stopped , aware of the dreadful thing he had been about to say , and aware also that his new friend , Saltwood , knew how the sentence would have been completed . It was then , at the moment of their triumphant return from the Black Circuit , that the veil dropped between these two men . Saltwood was first to speak : ' If Emma has run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' If my slave is at your mission , you can be sure I 'll come and take her . ' ' Van Doorn , do n't fight the law . ' No law gives you my slave . I paid good money for her . She belongs here . ' She belongs in the care of Jesus Christ . ' ' Get out ! ' Throwing open the door , he ordered Saltwood to be gone , but when the latter headed for the hill , he summoned two Hottentots andp320directed them to speed west , keep out of sight , and fetch the slave girl Emma from the mission . Saltwood , anticipating such a maneuver , traveled at forced speed , but when he reached Golan he found the place in an uproar , for the Hottentots had preceded him and were in the process of carrying off the little girl , who was weeping and struggling in their arms . Without hesitating , Saltwood dashed to his quarters , grabbed his gun , and confronted the kidnappers : Drop your hands . Back on your horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say take your hands off her . ' No ! She belong us . ' At this moment Emma broke loose and ran to Saltwood , throwing herself at him , and when he felt this child seeking his protection , he determined to rescue her at any cost ; and as the Hottentots reached out to seize her , he fired his gun over their heads , frightening them and terrifying himself . Fortunately , the two brown men scuttled to their horses and gallopedaway , for had they lunged at Saltwood again , he would have been quite incapable of firing at them , even had his gun contained a second chamber . Hilary now placed the child with Saul 's family , where she began learningthe alphabet , the catechism and the refulgent promises of the New Testament . She proved an able student , as gifted in singing as in sewing , and before long it was her glowing black face and gleaming teeth that showed in the front rank of the mission choir . She was practicing under the trees one evening when Lodevicus van Doorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting carelesslyon his saddle . I 've come to fetch you , Emma , ' he said quietly . She will not go , ' Saul said , trembling at the sight of the menacing guns . If you try to stop me , Kaffir , I 'll blow your head off . ' Lodevicus did not touch either of the guns , but he did move his horse closer to Emma . With a dignity many of the blacks acquired at the mission , old Saul moved to protect the child , whereupon Lodevicus raised one of his guns . For God 's sake ! ' a voice cried from one side . Are you mad ? ' It was Saltwood , coming to lead the choir . Unarmed , he walked directly to the muzzle of the gun , looked up at Lodevicus , and ordered : Ride back to De Kraal . ' Not without my Madagascan . ' Emma lives here now . ' I have an order from the court at Graaff-Reinet which says  --  ' Such orders apply to runaway slaves , not to little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood out like the vines of a squash . Yougoddamned meddler .. Old friend , ' Saltwood said quietly , get off that horse and let 's talk . ' I 'm going to take my slave . ' Come here , Emma , ' and the little girl in her blue mission dress ran to clasp her protector . Van Doorn was infuriated . Emma was his property , worth a great deal of money , and he had a proper order directing her return . If he shot this Englishman now , the frontier Boers would support him and to hell with thep321English , but as he raised his gun , Saul stepped quietly in front of the missionary and the child , extending his arms to protect them , and there was something in this gesture which caused the Boer to hesitate . If he fired now , he would have to kill three people , and one of them a little girl . He could not do such a thing . But as always , Saltwood said the wrong words : If you kill me , Lodevicus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down to the ends of the earth . ' From his saddle the Boer burst into a contemptuous laugh . You English . You goddamned English ! ' Without further comment , he wheeled his horse and headed back to the veld . He would ride through the night rather than spend it with fools like this English missionary . When word circulated through the farms of the Boer community that the English missionary Saltwood had stolen the slave girl Emma and provided her refuge at Golan , consternation spread among them , and meetings were convened to which participants might have to ride for fifty miles . At each the principal orator was the patriarch Lodevicus the Hammer , who saw more clearly than most the dangers men like him faced . I can see the inevitable , ' he ranted . The English want our Hottentots to live like Boers . Our lands are to be whittled down till we crowd together like Kaffirs . And mark my word , one day our slaves will be taken from us . And then our language will be outlawed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A farmer from near Graaff-Reinet , who had seen the fairly amicable relations that existed there between Boers and English officials , said , False fears . We can abide the English till they leave again . ' Quiet happenings proved that he was wrong . This time the English invaders showed no sign of quitting the country , and indignation ran through the isolated community when three new clergymen were assigned to remote districts ; all were Scotsmen . You 'd think we had no predikants of our own , ' the farmers cried , truly distressed at this radical change . It 's England pressing us under the heel , ' Lodevicus announced , and he refused to send any further tithing to the church . The fault was not England 's . The government knew that frontier congregationslonged for predikants who could speak Dutch , and those in charge wanted to send out such men , but there simply were none . Consideringall the colonization under way throughout the world at this period , South Africa was the only major settlement in which organized religion failed to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency became apparent , the government did the next best thing : it imported large numbers of young Scots Presbyterians who made the easy jump from John Knox to John Calvin ; they were fine public servants , men of great devotion and a tribute to their religion . Lodevicus , of course , was unaware of England 's good intentions in this matter , and even if they had been explained to him , he would have damned them ; all he was concerned with was that the new predikants were from an alien country , and would be bringing alien ideas . It was clear to him thatp322they had been inserted to destroy Boer influence ; one element of his gloomy prediction was being proved true . Since there were no schools anywhere near De Kraal , Lodevicus was not personally involved in the next scandal , but he was outraged when he heard from farmers in settled areas like Swellendam that English was invading the schools . Shocking ! ' one man told a group of Boers . My son Nicodemus goes to school on Monday  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tells him , " From now on we speak English , " or something like that . Nicodemus , he do n't speak English , so how does he know ? ' Bitter resentment developed among the Boers , and many a family , after the Bible reading at night , reflected on the warnings Lodevicus had uttered : It 's coming around the way he said . First our church , then our school . Next we 'll be forbidden to speak Dutch in court . ' This prediction had scarcely been voiced when a farmer near GraaffReinetwho wanted to lodge a complaint about a boundary was informed that he must submit his brief in English . This provoked further argument , with Lodevicus resuming his role as prophet : Most sacred possession a man can have , even surpassing the Bible , I sometimes think , is his native tongue . A Boer thinks different from an Englishman and expresses that thinking in his own language . If we do n't protect our language everywhere , church and court , we surrender our soul . I say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , because otherwise we can never be free . ' Lodevicus , like all the Van Doorns , was obsessed with freedom , but only for himself . When one Englishman argued : Historical parallelism , old man . When the Huguenots came here , you Dutch were in command and forbade them to speak French . Now we 're in charge , and we want you to speak English . Only fair . ' At such reasoning the old man exploded : Goddamn ! This place was never French ! Only Dutch ! It will never be English either . You learn the Dutch of the Afrikaner , damn you . ' He would have chastised the visitor had not others intervened . The Englishman sought to apologize , but Lodevicus was caught in a mighty rage and , his neck muscles bulging , he shouted , Never , never will our soil be English . ' Storming about the room like a Biblical patriarch , he thundered , You will have to kill me first . . . and then my sons . . . and then their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this background of rebellious thought that Lodevicus the Hammer rose against the English in 1815 . Tjaart was absent with the herds when a horseman came riding up to De Kraal late one evening . Van Doom ! Lodevicus van Doom ! ' he shouted , leaping from the saddle . The white-bearded old man stepped outside . ' Ja , broeder , wat is dit ? ' Breathlessly : Hottentots are killing Boers ! ' And when Lodevicus grabbed him by the neck , he stuttered : Frederick Bezuidenhout . . . lives thirty miles north of here . . . the court at Graaff-Reinet .. I know that court , ' Lodevicus snapped . What 's it done now ? ' Summoned Bezuidenhout . . . charges of abusing a servant . ' It seemed that when the accused , a rough , unlettered renegade , refused to appear , a lieutenant and twenty soldiers were sent to fetch him . Unwisely , all thep323soldiers were Hottentots , and when Bezuidenhout retreated to a cave , gunfire was exchanged , and the highly trained Hottentots shot him dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Good riddance . Those thieves . ' He knew the Bezuidenhouts as border ruffians who respected neither English rule nor Dutch , and as veldkornet he had often been required to discipline them . ' Afrika voor de Afrikaner ! ' was their battle cry , and they hated the English with a passion equaled only by their abhorrence of those Dutch who served what they called ' The Lords of London . ' They were an unregenerate lot and Lodevicus could not feel sorry over the death of Frederick . ' Van Doom ! ' the messenger shouted . ' Are you listening ? Hottentots sent by the English Kaffir-lovers murder a Boer . ' He shook the master of De Kraal and cried almost plaintively , ' We need you , Lodevicus Hammer . ' ' For what ? ' ' To lead the Boers . ' ' Against who ? ' ' The English . Who plan to kill off all us Boers . ' Van Doorn , much as he hated the English , could not accept this ridiculousstatement . He started to tell the messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Hottentots to fight the Xhosa , but the man was persistent . ' Lodevicus Hammer , if we let the English do this thing to one of us , they will do it to all , ' and his arguments were finally so persuasive that the old man asked , ' What do you want of me ? ' and the messenger said , ' Lead us against the English . ' ' And where would we get the troops ? ' Softly the messenger said , ' The Bezuidenhouts say we must go to Kaffirs. ; Neither man spoke , for this was the moment of treason , the moment when loyalties and moral judgments hung in the balance . Lodevicus van Doorn knew well that the ultimate battle his people would have to fight would be against the blacks , and he had seen how fearful that struggle could be . His father Adriaan , his mother Seena , his wife Rebecca had all been slain by the Xhosa , and he in turn had decimated their ranks . To ally with them now was unthinkable . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead one , ' he growled . ' No , no ! Van Doorn , listen to me . With the Kaffirs we can drive out the English . When that 's done we can settle with the Kaffirs . ' ' They butchered my family , ' Lodevicus said grimly . ' And now we use them for our purposes . ' He explained how this could be done , and concluded : ' I 've heard you say yourself , Vicus , that the English will destroy us . They will stamp on the backs of the Boers . They will make us say " Mister " to the Hottentots eating at our own table . ' On and on he went , driving home the message that the Englishman was the real enemy : ' Look what he did to you in the Black Circuit . ' This was the telling blow . Lodevicus , who had hammered the Kaffirs , took a great step down the road to treason : ' The enemy that matters is the enemy of today . He is white and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xhosa generals , ' the messenger whispered , and without conceding that he would actually unleash these fearsome warriors against the English , Lodevicus did agree to talk with them . Through the dark night the two conspirators rode east to the Great Fish , forded it upstream from a rude fort , and sought the dwelling of Guzaka , son of Sotopo . When at last Lodevicus faced the warrior , the two adversaries glared at each other in silence . Guzaka had slain three members of the Van Doorn family ; the Hammer had captained the destruction of more than three thousand Xhosa . Finally Guzaka rose , extended his two hands , and said , ' It is time . ' They sat outside Guzaka 's hut , two grizzled warriors licking their wounds like old tomcats , their claws blunted by the years . ' Ja , Kaffir , ' Van Doorn said slowly , ' here stands a Van Doorn asking your help . God knows it 's not right , but what else is there ? ' ' The Redcoats will destroy both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick them out . ' ' Killings , too many killings , ' Guzaka said . ' Settle with them , then we 'll settle peace between us . ' ' But you Boers steal our lands , too . ' ' Did we ever drive twenty thousand across the Big Fish ? It was the English who did that . ' ' It 's still our land , ' Guzaka said , confused by the drift of the conversation . ' Old man , you and I do n't have too many years . Let us solve the land question now . We drive out the English , then you and I make peace . We each herd cattle . We share the land . ' ' Can we defeat the Redcoats ? ' the old warrior asked . ' Together we can do anything , ' Lodevicus said with fervor , and impulsivelyhe clasped his enemy 's hand , for at that moment he truly believed those words . Inspired by this show of friendship , Guzaka said , ' Tonight I shall discuss this with my headmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word he knew well , for along this contested border there had been more than fifteen treaties , none with prospects more hopeful than this : Boer and Xhosa against the enemy . But during this parley , which might have meant so much to the frontier , a young Xhosa warrior with wild and shifting eyes who claimed to see visions and exercise prophecy  --  a thin man with a ridged scar across his forehead  --  had sat off to one side , carefully watching , his heart smoldering with hatred for Van Doorn . He remembered that years ago this huge Boer had scattered tobacco on the ground as a trap ; his father had stooped to retrieve it  --  and fifty warriors had perished . So after Lodevicus and the messenger withdrew , the trembling prophet harangued his tribesmen : ' Jackals ! Cowards ! Men without skins ! Who is this Van Doorn who comes begging ? Is he not the sorcerer who uses tobacco to slay his enemies ? The blood of my people is on his hands . ' ' The blood of his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the time to halt the bloodshed . ' ' What can this monster do for us ' ? ' the prophet demanded.  |p325'He  will help us fight the English , ' Guzaka argued . With the Boers we can live in peace . With the English , never . ' If we help these Boers today , ' the scarred prophet warned , they will steal our land when the battle is over . I say kill them tonight . ' But Guzaka saw a chance to gain that lasting peace without which his people would suffer unbroken travail , and he tried vainly to support the concept of a combined attack on the English ; he achieved nothing , for the prophet , inflamed by an apocalyptic vision of long-dead Xhosa generals rising mysteriously to launch an attack on both the English and the Boers , expelling them from the land , cried , He is old and frightened ! ' And three young warriors struck Guzaka , leader of many battles , to the ground and killed him . They then raged out into the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the mists , sixty warriors , spurred on by the prophet , fell upon the tent where Lodevicus slept . The old man reached for his gun , but before he could fire even one shot , assegais pierced his chest and he fell back . As he lay dying in treachery he moaned , Merciful God , forgive me . Forgive me . ' As he fell back , blood gushing from his lips , he mumbled , Adriaan , Seena . Rebecca , me . The circle .. News of the death of Lodevicus had not yet reached De Kraal when Hilary Saltwood entered the valley with Saul . Tjaart , returning from the cattledrive , eyed the missionary suspiciously , seeing him only as the Englishmanwho had stolen the slave girl Emma . Clasping the sjambok at his side , he flicked the long hide over the grass and growled , Off these lands , Saltwood . ' Hilary , perched on the riding seat of a small cart , felt Saul trembling next to him . Put that down , Tjaart . This is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman , and take that damned Kaffir with you . ' Saltwood 's eyes followed the line of the menacing whip , then crept up to Tjaart 's face . The Boer recognized a look of anguished appeal , and his next words were less intemperate : What is it you want ? ' It 's your father , Tjaart . ' Wilhelmina and Tjaart 's wife , who had been listening inside the house , stepped outside and stood glaring at the intruder ; at the sight of the women Saltwood held back his words . What about my father ? ' He rode with the rebels . ' Damnit , man , I know that . And I join them tomorrow . ' Lord , why me ? Hilary asked himself as if in prayer . Why does it always have to be me who faces this family . Tjaart , your father is dead . ' The younger Van Doorn ground out his words : What you say , Englishman ? ' Till now they had been conversing in the language of the Boers , but in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained from Wilhelmina 's face . Putting her arm about her daughter-in-law 's shoulders , she drew her close to her bosom , and in thatp326instant she thought of the long years since the day she rode north from a godless past to offer herself to Lodevicus the Hammer . They had been good years and violent . Twice her lips formed his name , and when she looked up at the stricken , bean-thin missionary she knew that he was telling the truth . Her wild old man was dead . The Kaffirs killed him , ' Saltwood repeated . Quietly he explained that his Xhosa , Saul , had been visiting across the Great Fish and had learned of the mission to Guzaka and of the dual tragedy that ensued . When he assured them that Saul would be able to lead them to the body , Wilhelmina said softly , Dominee , you must be tired . Come in . ' That afternoon they started the grim journey ; Wilhelmina was insistent that the Hammer should be buried where he fell . He was a man of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she refused Saltwood 's offer of burial at the mission . At noon next day , while the Xhosa were lamenting the death of the general , Guzaka , the white men and women piled rocks above the grave of Lodevicus , whereupon the missionary offered a prayer in Dutch , after which he recited the somber passages of the Ninetieth Psalm : The days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away . . . So teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom . ' On their return , the mourners reached the point at which Saltwood and Saul must head east for Golan , and it seemed to the missionary that his life and Tjaart 's were as divergent as the directions they would now follow ; he had been as close to a Van Doorn during these past days as he would ever be , and this moved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebels . Do n't seek tragedy . ' You ? ' Tjaart asked . You worry about my soul ? ' Concerning the slave girl , Emma , who has caused so much bitterness . I want to buy her . ' A dominee ? Buying a De Kraal slave ? ' Her and her parents . ' Where would you get the money ? ' I 'd write home . . . to my mother . ' The fatuousness of this statement amused all the Van Doorns , and for the first time since the death of the Hammer they broke into laughter . He 'll write home to his mother ! ' Tjaart mimicked . But he did agree to sell the slaves . Even as the laughter echoed , the final scenes of the futile uprising were being enacted to the north , where well-trained English soldiers pinned down a ragtag commando of seventy dissident Boers , most of whom surrendered without a shot . A few of the ringleaders escaped to fight a bitter-end clash , but when it ended , Johannes Bezuidenhout , brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first abortive rebellion was ended . It was a sound that never before had been heard in this part of the world : two slow-footed drummers marching alongside a cart in which stood sixp327manacled men and beating out the pace of death . The two horses , groomed for the occasion , hauled the last of the Bezuidenhout rebels into a beautiful valley surrounded by comforting hills . The six men had been sentenced to death , but one had been reprieved : before his life in jail began he must stand tied by the neck to the gallows while his five companions were hanged . The place chosen for the hanging was so appallingly named , and the events it would witness so hideous , that it would reverberate in South African history : Slagter 's Nek  --  The Neck of the Slaughterer . The crowd of witnesses was great . All revolutionaries not condemned were required to stand in the shadow of the gallows , as were members of the men 's families , and the two widows of the Bezuidenhouts already dead . Near three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , Hottentot militia in marching gear , and loyal Boers in the rough dress of the commando . And in command of all rode a most extraordinary man : the son of the mayor of Albany , New York , in the new United States of America . Colonel Jacob Glen Cuyler , forty years old and a fine figure of a man , had been born on the eve of the American Revolution into a loyalist family . When his parents refused to support the revolution , they fled to Canada , where young Jacob joined the British army . Because of his Dutch heritage , it seemed sensible to send him to South Africa , where he landed with the second English invading force of i8o6 . A man of courage and intelligence , he prospered in the new colony , rising to rank of colonel and magistrate of a large district south of Graaff-Reinet . He was a foe of revolutionaries . They had driven him from his home in America and left him with indelible memories : when he came to South Africa he brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death by Major John Andre , who lived with the Cuylers before his execution as an English spy . Colonel Cuyler , acting under strict orders from Cape Town , was determined that these hangings be conducted with propriety . It was he who had suggested the two drummers ; it was he who had stopped at Golan Mission on the way north to tell Missionary Saltwood : It 's always proper to have a clergyman present at a hanging . Gives religious sanction and helps control the doomed men . ' No one who attended the hangings at Slagter 's Nek would ever forget them ; women and men would sometimes cry in the night , not because of the hangings , which occurred often in those days , but because of the soulwrenchingthing that happened . When the five condemned men were led to the gallows , they were forced to climb upon movable platforms and stand at attention , hands and feet tied , as the ropes were attached to their necks and knotted . Some of the men accepted blindfolds , others ignored them , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the platforms were kicked away . For a long , terrible moment the doomed men struggled in the air  --  and then the miracle happened ! Four of the five ropes broke , allowing those men to fall free . When this occurred a great shout of joy rose from everyone , even the rows of Hottentot corpsmen . Reverend Saltwood actually jumped up andp328down , throwing his arms in the air and crying , God be praised ! ' In a frenzy of relief he clasped the men who had been so miraculously saved and knelt in the dust to untie their ankle fetters . Then he led them in prayers , which seemed to gush forth as if God Himself were rejoicing . In his exultation at this happy escape from tragedy , even though the unlucky fifth rebel dangled dead , he found himself next to Tjaart van Doorn , and in mutual joy the two enemies embraced . Thank God , thank God ! ' Hilary mumbled repeatedly as he and Tjaart danced in the shadow of the gallows . Tjaart ! ' Saltwood cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can be friends , truly we can . ' Maybe we can , ' Tjaart said , and it was in that moment of reconciliation that the awful thing happened . Re-form ! ' Cuyler shouted . Bring new ropes . ' What ? ' Saltwood cried , unable to comprehend what he was hearing . New ropes ! ' But , Colonel ! In English law . . . if the rope breaks , the man goes free ! ' As soon as Hilary voiced this ancient edict , and a good one it was , for it acknowledged that God Himself sometimes intervened to save the condemned , the crowd took up the cry , and those relatives who had been rejoicing with their reprieved men ran to the officer , reminding him of this honored tradition . They are saved ! ' the people cried . You can not hang them a second time . ' True , ' Saltwood pleaded , tugging at Cuyler 's sleeve . It 's a custom all men honor . The hanging was completed when God intervened . ' Suddenly Cuyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a revolution to quell . Having been driven away from Albany , he understood the terror that could engulf a land when revolutionary ideas were allowed to gallop across a countryside , and he intended having none of that in Africa . These men must die . So it was frustrating when this damn-fool English priest started making trouble . With a vigorous shove he knocked Saltwood back and cried to his orderly , Bind that silly ass and take him away . ' No , sir , no ! ' Hilary protested . You will defile this land if you  --  ' Take him away , ' Cuyler said coldly , and soldiers seized the missionary , clapping a hand over his mouth so that he could protest no further , and dragged him off . Then the four survivors whom God had touched were placed once more upon the platforms , their faces ashen as fresh ropes were tied about their necks . It was not a roar that came from the crowd . It was not a military challenge to the new government . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be done on so fair a day . Then , from the area in which he was being held , came Saltwood 's high begging scream : No ! No ! ' Once more the platforms were kicked aside . This time the ropes held . When Tjaart van Doorn returned to De Kraal he was silent for a long while , then grimly he summoned his mother , his wife , his children , and in solemn conclave lined out the mystical litany that would be recited in die-hard Boerp329families from that day forward : ' Never forget the Black Circuit when Hottentots and liars bore testimony in English courts against honest Boers . Never forget how the English have tried to banish our language . Never forget Slagter 's Nek , where an English officer hanged the same men twice , in disobedience to God 's law . ' Tjaart was twenty-six now , a quiet , stubborn man emerging slowly from the shadows of his father 's flaming exuberance to assume responsibility for De Kraal . His character was not yet fully formed ; he supported all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing himself that ' Father was driven to it in desperation over the illegal acts of the English . ' But he knew he could never take the Hammer 's place as champion of the Boers ; his was a calmer approach , that of the self-confident bull who rules the pasture without bellowing . It became obvious to him that English rule would have to be challenged , but when and how , he could not guess . He supposed that the invaders would make one small mistake after another , digging their own graves , until that day when the Boers would be able to resume control of their native land . When Colonel Cuyler returned from the hangings at Slagter 's Nek , he was so disgusted with Reverend Saltwood 's pusillanimous behavior  --  for so he considered it  --  that he submitted an angry report to Cape Town , confirming what many government officials had begun to suspect : that Hilary was an irresponsible character whose loyalties were questionable . From then on , the English segment of South Africa had little to do with the gawky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Richard Saltwood was conducting himselfrather well in India ; at Hindu hangings , of which he saw not a few , he gave way to no hysterics : ' Blighter was caught , he gets hanged , that 's that . ' In 1819 , as a newly commissioned major with six campaigns to his credit , two with Ochterlony against the Gurkhas , losing 1814 , winning 1816 , he shipped home to England from his regiment , and when his transport lay to at Cape Town he fully expected to unite with his brother , who was serving somewhere as a missionary , but when he found that Hilary was four or five hundred miles distant , he was amazed : ' This place is as big as India . ' And he surrendered any idea of trying to find him . He was not pleased with what he heard in Cape Town regarding Hilary'scurious behavior ; one army wife said , ' It 's the frontier , Richard . The Kaffirs , the Hottentots , the Boer farmers who ca n't read or write . Our army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all they can take . How long 's your brother been there ? Nine long years ? No wonder he 's acting up . ' An army captain who had been stationed at Graaff-Reinet was more specific : ' It 's the moral loneliness . . . the intellectual loneliness . The church in London sends them books and all that , but there they are , stuck away and gone . I would n't dare leave one of my men out there for even two years . They 'd go to rot . ' ' In what way ? '  |p330They  begin to see everything from the point of view of the natives . They learn the language , you know . Eat Kaffir food . Some of them , God forbid , take Kaffir wives . ' Not missionaries , certainly . ' Yes , even marry them . And there have been cases . . . ' He dropped his voice significantly to allow Major Saltwood to guess what those cases had consisted of . Is there anything I can do ? ' Richard asked . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he find  --  ' The captain interrupted , wishing to elaborate on a point which he had often considered : Fact is , men everywhere are sounder stuff if they have wives . Keeps them responsible . Go to bed earlier . Eat better-prepared food . Missionaries are no different . Your brother needs a wife . ' Why does n't he take one ? ' None to be had . ' I saw lots of women at the dance last night . ' None single . ' He ran off a list of the pretty women Richard had met , and every one was married . They did n't seem so last night , ' Richard said . What you must do , ' the captain said , is when you get home , find your brother a good wife . One who accepts missionaries . ' And ship her out ? ' That 's the way we all do . Every ship comes into Table Bay has its quota , but never enough . ' He looked reflectively into his cup . When you 're in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when you 're overseas and there are none  --  no white ones , that is  --  damn , they seem important . ' It was under this urging that Richard Saltwood drafted a letter to his brother : I was most fearfully disappointed not to have met you during my visit . The regiment 's home to Wiltshire with me a major , thanks to some lucky work against the Gurkhas . I find myself quite homesick for Sentinels , and wish to God you were going to be at home when I get there . Several people in Cape Town , religious and military alike , urged me to find you a wife when I get back to Salisbury , a task I face for myself . Send Mother a letter , quickly , telling us whether we should proceed and how . Your woman could be aboard one of the next ships to Cape Town , and I could be , too , because I 've taken a great liking to your land . I think an English soldier could do well here , and I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Glorious Fifty-ninth . When Hilary received the letter he was at low ebb , for Golan Mission was not doing well . The rows of huts were filled with Hottentots and Xhosa seeking to avoid work under the Boers , but few were sincere Christians . Not even Emma 's parents had converted , and there was a problem with Emma herself . She was nineteen now , and a true Christian , but plans of some kind had to be made for her future ; the most she could hope for was marriagep331to some half-Christian Xhosa ; more probably she would slip back into servitude at some Boer kraal . Funds to support the mission were slow in coming from England , and one young man who had been seconded to relieve Hilary had taken one look at South Africa and scrambled back aboard his ship , preferring to trust his luck in India . Hilary kept himself insulated from such disappointments by cherishing his trivial accomplishments and sharing them with Emma : Phambo appeared at prayers again , and I do believe he is on the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the Xhosa camp on the other side of the Great Fish , taking with him three Golan cows , Hilary did not condemn him : Poor Phambo heard temptation and could not resist , but when he returns , Emma , as I am convinced he will , we must greet him as our brother , with or without the cows . ' Hilary refused to acknowledge the ostracism directed against him by both the Boers and the English : the former because he was an agent of the English repression ; the latter because he had behaved poorly ' at Slagter 's Nek . And both sides viewed him with scorn for supporting the Kaffirs against white men . One good reason why he was able to ignore the ostracism was that he rarely participated in any public gathering . His world was his church . But his brother 's letter suggesting that he take a wife made great sense ; he was thirty-four now , worn and wasted by his exertions on a difficult frontier , and he felt the need for someone to share his spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sons , could comb the Salisbury scene and locate a suitable wife , the years ahead might prove more profitable both to Jesus and to His servant Saltwood . So he wrote a careful letter , advising his mother as to the , requirements for a missioner 's wife in South Africa . He was distracted from such personal matters when Tjaart , accompanied by four Boers , galloped into the mission one morning , shouting in anxiety , We need every man ! The Kaffirs are marching on Grahamstown . ' The commando waited some fifteen minutes for Saltwood to arm himself , and Hilary spent ten of these in agonizing inner debate as to whether it was Christian for him to participate in armed combat against the Xhosa , a people he loved ; but he realized that until the frontier was pacified , not even missionary work could proceed , so reluctantly he took his rifle . Bring your Hottentots , too ! ' Tjaart cried , and six of them eagerly mounted up . For the English to have used armed Hottentots against the Boers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaffirs was prudent . It was seventy miles from Golan Mission to the little military post at Grahamstown , and as the Boers urged their horses onward , Saltwood reflectedthat only Englishmen lived in the village , yet here were the Boers galloping full speed to aid them . He was aware that Tjaart despised the English , inveighing against them at every chance , but when an English outpost was threatened by Kaffirs , the Boer commandos were always ready to saddle up . It was confusing . The twelve newcomers were given a cheering welcome at Grahamstown , where fewer than three hundred English and Hottentot soldiers , plus two cannon , awaited the Xhosa attack . Tjaart 's contingent meant thatp332thirty civilians would aid the soldiers ; he was distressed when the English commander divided his troops : Half to the barracks southeast of town , half here with me to defend the empty town . ' He sent the women and children to the safety of the barracks , except for five , who said , We 'll fight with our husbands in the town . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady advance of the Xhosa horde , but Tjaart and Saltwood could not credit the numbers they recited . Hottentots always exaggerate , ' Tjaart explained . Whites and blacks are so much bigger , they think there 's more of us . ' But at dawn the defenders gaped in sickening awe as the slopes northeast of Grahamstown showed more than ten thousand warriors descending in three massed divisions . The noise of this multitude as they began dashing toward the settlement caused fear in every heart . The brow-scarred Xhosa prophet had predicted certain victory : When Grahamstown falls , we have a clear run through every frontier farm from the ocean to the mountains at the north ! ' Behind the exulting regiments came hundreds of women with their cooking pots and gourds , for the prophet had promised them : At sunset we shall feast as never before . Redcoats and Boers alike , destroyed . ' Tjaart , imbued with the spirit of the Hammer , perceived the impending attack as one more clash in a never-ending battle . There stood the enemy , here stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter was to chastise the former . Turning to the men near him , he said , Anyone afraid to fight , ride off now . ' And he looked directly at Saltwood , half expecting him to flee , but throughout history no Saltwood had ever deserted , and Hilary would not break that tradition . Turning to his six Hottentots , he asked , Are you ready ? ' and the brown men nodded . Then let us pray , ' and when he had done so in English , Tjaart asked if he might add words of his own , and in Dutch he prayed : Like Abraham we face the Canaanites . Like him we place our lives in Thy hands . Great God , guide us good Christians as once again we smite these Kaffirs . ' The attack came in early afternoon , wave after wave of shrieking Xhosa roaring down the hill to hurl themselves against the soldiers in the town . Those in the barracks had to watch , helpless , as the regiments rushed at the little houses . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' a lieutenant ordered . Our time will come . ' The most daring of the Xhosa got to within one hundred feet of the soldiers , but then massed gunfire raked their ranks and the two cannon wreaked devastation . Hundreds of blacks fell in the front ranks , until their commanders , seeing that the English line could not be broken , gave the order to swing onto the barracks . Here they were more successful , penetratingthe small collection of buildings . This landed them in the center of the barracks square , where they were safe , since the cannon could not be brought directly against them for fear of killing fellow Englishmen and Boers . The fighting would have to be hand-to-hand . Tjaart and Saltwood were in the midst of it , shoulders pressed . They saw two Hottentots go down , a Redcoat fall . A huge Xhosa leaped at Salt wood . swinging his war club , but Tjaart twisted about to drop him with a pistol shot . For almost an hour the battle raged in the square , then finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to retreat . A jubilant cry arose from the white and Hottentot fighters as the warriors fled in uncontrolled panic . Grahamstown had been saved ! In the aftermath of battle Saltwood was missing , and for a while Tjaart wondered if this missionary , who had fought so bravely , had been dragged away by the fleeing Xhosa , but as Tjaart searched a field he saw Hilary , bloody and disheveled , kneeling beside a dying Xhosa . Tears streamed down his face , and when he saw his neighbor Van Doorn approaching he looked up in bewilderment . Seven hundred of them dead , ' he mumbled softly . I 've counted more than seven hundred lying here . Three of our men dead . May God forgive us for this slaughter . ' Dominee , ' Tjaart reasoned . God wanted us to win this battle . ' When the missionary muttered something incoherent , Van Doorn added , In warfarelike this , so few of us against so many of them , it 's no time to love thy enemy . Destroy him . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can you see Golan burning ? ' Saltwood looked up at the man who had saved his life . He tried to justify his feelings of repugnance , but he could form no words . It 's all right , Dominee , ' Tjaart said . We taught the Kaffir bastards a lesson they 'll remember . Till next time . ' Next time ? ' Tjaart tugged at his beard . It will never stop , Dominee . Not till one side is victor in this land . ' Saltwood had to admit , though reluctantly , that what Van Doorn was saying was true , but he did not voice this thought , for next to him the young Xhosa warrior , no more than a boy , shuddered and lay still . When Hilary Saltwood 's letter reached Sentinels in the shadow of Salisbury Cathedral , his mother was fifty-four years old , a widow and eager to help her distant son find the proper wife . The commission was not an unusual one in rural England . Sons of distinguished families would venture to all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization in places like India , South America and Ceylon , without ever thinking of marrying local women the way Portuguese and French colonizers did . An Englishman remembered the girl left behind , and when he was in his mid-thirties he would come home , and some gaunt woman in her early thirties , who in another society would never find a husband , would be waiting , and they would repair to the village church , two people who had been terrified of missing life , and they would be married , and flowers would be scattered , and the local curate would dry his eyes at this little miracle , and soon the pair would be off to some other remote spot . Or , as in this case , the son would write home to his parents and ask them to pursue his courtship for him , and they would visit only the daughters of families they had known for a generation , and again some older woman who might never have married would find that she was needed in some far country by a man she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and men who deviated from it by marrying local women were apt to find their lives truncated , if not ruined.  |p334Emily  Saltwood , upon reading her son 's appeal , retired to her room for two days and reflected upon the marriageable daughters of her friends , and after trying her best to judge the girls from a man 's point of view , and a missionary 's , she decided that the family she must visit was the Lambtons , who lived across the bridge within the purlieus of the cathedral . Wishing not to share her secret mission with any servant , she elected not to use her carriage but to walk to the village , where she sought out the bricked path leading to the Lambton residence , at whose door she knocked quietly . After an interval that troubled her , because it seemed that no one was at home , she heard shuffling feet approach , and an elderly maid creaked open the door . Mrs. Lambton is not at home , ' she said . Nor was Miss Lambton there , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral grounds , for they had planned on having tea in that vicinity . Emily said , You know , it 's frightfully important that I see Mrs. Lambtonimmediately , and I think you 'd better go fetch them . ' I could n't leave the house , ma'am . ' The maid was insistent . On this day you 'd better . ' Emily Saltwood could be just as insistent . Could n't you go and meet them at the cathedral ? ' No , I could n't . Because what I have to discuss is not for an open park . Now you scurry off and find your mistress , or I 'll take this umbrella to you . ' This the maid understood , and after a while she returned , leading both Mrs. Lambton and her daughter Vera . This was rather more than Emily had expected , so she said quite brusquely , It was your mother I wished to see , ' and the tall girl , twenty-nine years old and somewhat timid , dutifully vanished . I 've had a curious letter from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without another word being spoken , Mrs. Lambton grasped the significance of this abrupt meeting . Keeping her hands under discipline , lest they tremble , she said , Vera and I remember Hilary well . The soldier , was n't he ? ' The missionary , ' Emily said . Yes , yes . ' Her hands were now trembling furiously , but she kept them hidden . She knew she 'd made an unforgivable mistake , confusing the Saltwoodboys , but she recovered admirably by throwing Emily on the defensive : Did n't you have a son who went to America ? ' Alas , we did . Never hear of him . ' They tell me that your boy Richard 's thinking of returning to India ... without the regiment . ' He 's headstrong . He 'll be off to some remote spot . ' Tell me , Emily , how does a mother feel when her chicks are so scat-tered ? ' You may soon know , because Hilary has asked me to ascertain whether Vera . . . ' It was most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , but it was inescapable . He wonders if Vera would like to join him in South Africa  --  in the mission field , that is . ' She 's a devout girl , ' Mrs. Lambton parried . All us Lambtons are devoted to the church . ' I know , I know . That 's why it 's been so easy for me to approach you on so delicate a matter . '  |p335I  do n't know how Vera ... ' Mrs. Lambton spoke defensively , as if her daughter were accustomed to weighing such proposals , but Emily Saltwood was not going to have any of that . Abruptly she said , ' Vera 's at the age when she must make up her mind ... and quickly . Hilary 's a fine lad and he needs a wife . ' How old is he ? ' Mrs. Lambton asked sweetly . Thirty-four . The proper age for such a marriage . ' And has he prospects ? ' His older brother  --  Peter , that is  --  he 'll inherit the house , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these days . When his tour ends , of course . ' Most interesting . ' Mrs. Lambton knew of three young clergymen who were being considered for that promotion . Besides , Hilary suffered an impedimentwhich completely disqualified him , and it was important to knock down Mrs. Saltwood 's bargaining position early in the game : Did n't I hear that your son took orders with the Methodists , or something quite awful like that ? ' She beamed her benign Sunday-in-church smile . Merely for his ordination to do Christ 's work . He 'll scamper back into the proper fold , once he returns . ' She , too , smiled . You 've heard , I 'm sure , that before he died , the old Proprietor , who was extremely fond of Hilary , made special overtures for him at the cathedral . ' Pity he died , ' Mrs. Lambton said . She had other solid objections to sending her daughter to a land so remote as South Africa , but she was realist enough to know that Vera was aging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the absent Hilary had to be considered , so she extended Mrs. Saltwood a courtesy she did not fully feel : I think we should discuss this , Emily . ' Shall we involve Vera ? ' Mrs. Saltwood asked . Not at this point , I think . And certainly not the two of us . It would make everything seem too important . ' It 's just that , ' Emily said with that charming frankness that characterizedso many elderly English women who no longer felt restraints . It 's very important for my son , and frankly , it ought to be for Vera too . She 's not getting any younger . ' She walked home across the old bridge , turned right , and went down the quiet lane leading to Sentinels , where she felt vaguely uneasy , although unaware that national events were about to do her work for her . In London her eldest son , Peter , now a member of Parliament for Old Sarum , had become a leader in the movement to alleviate English unemploymentby the device of granting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This interesting action will serve two noble purposes . In England it will remove large numbers of unfortunate people from our charity rolls , and in South Africa it will correct the imbalance that now exists between the many Dutch and the few English . If our new colony below the equator is to become properly English , as it must , we shall have to throw many Englishmen into the balance pans , and this act will do just that.  |p336A  gigantic effort was mounted to convince impoverished Englishmen that they must quit their hopelessness at home and venture into the new paradise . Articles were published extolling the agricultural possibilities , the beauty of the landscape , and the salubriousness of the climate on the right bank of the Great Fish River , in the vicinity of that splendid rural capital Grahamstown . No mention was made of the recent attack by ten thousand assegaied Xhosa on said capital or the deaths among those who had defendedit . Most helpful were the speeches and writings of Reverend Simon Keer , who assured Englishmen that those lucky enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare would be paid by the government and whose land would be given free , a hundred rolling acres to each family  --  would be entering a paradise to which America and Australia were niggardly in comparison . To residents of crowded England , where a family could live well on twenty acres , the vision of a hundred , rent-free , tax-free , was compelling . Ninety thousand citizens , well mixed as to occupation , education and ability , volunteered to emigrate , a superior lot , really , to those who had emigrated earlier to Canada and America , and had they all been moved to Cape Town , the history of Africa would have been sharply modified , for at this time there were only some twenty-five thousand Boers in the entire colony , and the infusion of so many Englishmen would have made South Africa much like any other British colony . But enthusiastic members of Parliament , such as Peter Saltwood , promised much more than they could deliver , and when the time came to fill the ships , only enough money to transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousandwho might have restructured a nation had to be left behind . Among those lucky enough to be included was a young man of twentyfivenamed Thomas Carleton , a carriage builder by trade , whose enthusiasm matched the rhetoric of speakers like Peter Saltwood and Simon Keer . From the first moment he heard of the emigration plan , he wanted to go , and with letters of approval from his minister and sheriff , he was among the first interviewed : My business is solid , but it 's not really thriving . I want to go where distances are great and men must have wagons . ' Have you any money saved ? ' Not a penny , but I have strong arms , a willing back and a complete set of tools fully paid . ' The examiners doubted if they would find many men so qualified and unanimously recommended that he be accepted , so he was given a slip of paper guaranteeing his passage and the allocation of one hundred acres . He was to report three months hence to Southampton , where the ship Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find yourself a wife , ' the examiners explained . Not me ! ' Thomas said . I have n't a penny to feed a wife . ' When the news of this grand scheme reached Salisbury , the Lambtons listened with more than casual attention , and the more they heard , the more convinced they became that this was the kind of adventure to which an unmarried girl of good breeding might subscribe . Of course , Vera would notp337be sailing as an ordinary charity case , her way paid by the government ; as the intended bride of a clergyman who might one day be dean of the finest cathedral in England , and the sister-in-law-to-be of an important member of Parliament , she would have preferment . But the grand decision hung in the balance until Salisbury was visited by the one man in England who spoke as if he knew most about the new colony , Dr. Simon Keer , as he now called himself , a power in the LMS . He announced a public meeting in the cathedral cloisters , where chairs lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone he explained everything . He was now middle-aged , a short , plump little man with red hair , a Lancashire accent and a powerful voice that boomed as it echoed from the noble walls ; his oratory rolled like thunder as he spoke of challenges and flashed like lightning when he outlined the potentialities : ' If we grapple courageously with the problem of slavery in this colony , we shall show the way for Canada and Jamaica and Barbadosand , yes , the United States itself . Any English man or woman who accepts this invitation to perform God 's duty will be serving all of mankind . I wish I could sail in those ships , for all who do will be rebuilding the world . ' When the Lambtons lingered to ask him if he knew anything of Grahamstown , where the new settlers would be given their land , he showed his frank astonishment that a family as distinguished as theirs might be interested in emigrating : It 's for the poorer type , you know . The solid workers of the world . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're told that the Golan Mission , run by your Society . . . ' She had to say no more . With a wild clap of his hands and a leap in the air he cried , I know ! I know ! ' And he took Vera 's hands and danced a jig with her , even though she was a head taller than he . You 're going out to marry Hilary Saltwood . ' He spent an hour assuring the Lambtons of how fine a man this missionarywas . He reviewed the steps by which Hilary had reached conversion , and said that whereas he himself had not yet visited Golan Mission , for it had not been in existence when he served in that area , he had excellent reports of it . But then Vera took him aside for a confidential assessment . When he finished she was convinced that she could profitably sail to South Africa , but her mother raised one serious objection : With whom can Vera travel ? I do n't fancy her alone on a ship for four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a real problem , ' Dr. Keer conceded , but I 've been working closely with the shipping companies . Real gentlemen , you know . ' To hear the former missionary speak , he consorted only with the best families , stayed only at the great houses , and one gained the impression that he enjoyed missionary work far more when lecturing in England than he had when serving on the Xhosa frontier . I 'm sure we 'll find persons of quality among the ship 's officers . I 'll make inquiries . ' This was n't necessary , for within a week of Dr. Keer 's lecture in the cloisters , Richard Saltwood came down from London , where he had been consulting with his brother in Parliament , and his news was exciting :  |p338Mother  ! I 've resigned my commission . Was n't going anywhere down that lane . And Peter 's arranged with the colonial secretary for me . . . Point is , I 'm to have a government job at Grahamstown ! David lost in America . Me lost in South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother asked . There 's nothing for me here . I 've neither the money nor the talent to be a colonel of the regiment . So I 'm off to the new land . I saw it and liked it . Much better than India . ' This could be providential , ' his mother said . We 've found a bride for Hilary . The Lambton girl . You knew her years ago . She 's a tall , thin thing now and is desperately hungry for a husband , although she wo n't admit it . ' She 's sailing to Cape Town ? Splendid for Hilary . ' She 's ready to sail , ' Emily said hesitantly , but she 's afraid of going out with the emigrant mob  --  unattended , as it were . ' ' I ' 11 take her ! ' Richard said with the spontaneity that had gained him the affection of any troops with whom he served in close quarters . That 's what I had in mind , the moment you spoke . But there are grave dangers .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmish now and then , nothing to fear . ' It was n't that I was thinking of . Richard , will you go fetch Vera ? Right now ? ' They sat under the oak trees in the picnic chairs John Constable had used for his paints two years earlier when doing the large canvas showing Salisbury Cathedral in sunlight ; as an appreciation for his constant use of this lawn , he had dashed off a wonderful watercolor sketch of the towers , which he had given Emily on his departure ; it hung in the main room in a fine oak frame which she had cut and nailed herself . The Saltwoods of Salisbury had not survived for nearly two centuries , during which people of influence had tried to wrest Captain Nicholas Saltwood 's fortune from them , without acquiring certain shrewd skills , one of which was to marry young women of the vicinity who showed ability . Emily Saltwood had been one of the most resilient , mother of four good boys and counselor to all . She had never been afraid to pinpoint inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Richard ? Thirty-one ? ' He nodded . And you , Vera ? Twenty-nine ? ' She nodded . Then you 're old enough to realize that a four-month sail to Cape Town , aboard a small ship , in close confinementThe couple found it embarrassing to look at her , so she spoke with extra vigor , demanding their attention : Inherently dangerous , would n't it be ? ' I suppose so , ' Richard said . Old romances are full of this sort of thing . Tristan and Iseult over in Cornwall . One of the Spanish kings , if I recall , and his brother escorting the bride . Are you listening to what I 'm saying ? ' Richard placed his hand on his mother 's and said , I 'm taking a little girl I knew at playtime . . . out to marry my brother . When I seek a wife , I 'll find one for myself . ' Those are insulting words , ' Vera snapped , and for the first time the two Saltwoods looked at her as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . She was , as Emily said , twenty-nine , tallish , thinnish , not especially beautiful of face , but lovely of voice and smile . Like many young women her age she knew how to play the piano and had taken watercolor instruction from Mr. Constable when he stayed in the village . For the moment she was reticent , but as she grew older she would become much like the woman now counseling her : a strong English wife with a mind of her own . She had never yet been kissed by any man other than her father , and by him only rarely , but she had no fear of men and had always supposed that when the time came , her parents would find her a husband . She was a girl of spirit and rather looked forward to an interval on the frontier , always supposing that her husband would return to a position of some importance at the cathedral , in whose shadow she had been raised and intended to die . I 'm fully aware of the dangers , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice even though she realized that Mrs. Saltwood 's questioning reflected on her as much as on her son . That 's good , ' Emily said with an inflection that signified : This meeting'sover . We understand one another . ' But Richard had one thing more to say : You must tell Vera where the idea came from that sent you to her house . . . seeking a wife . . . for Hilary , that is . ' Emily laughed vigorously and took the young people 's hands in hers . Vera , when Richard passed through Cape Town various army friends advised him that Hilary needed a wife . It was Richard who set this all in motion . And now he proposes to complete the transaction . ' I do n't think of myself as a transaction , ' Vera said . We 're all transactions . My husband married me years ago because the Saltwood holdings needed close attention , much more than he needed a wife . ' They rose from their chairs under the oak trees and looked across at the stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see again . The Alice Grace was a small commercial barque accustomed to freighting cargo to India but now commissioned to carry some three hundred emigrantsto Cape Town , in conditions which would have terrified owners of cattle being shipped across the Channel to France . Her burthen was two hundred and eighty tons , which was significant in that by law she was entitled to carry three passengers for every four tons ; this meant that she should have sold passage to no more than two hundred and ten emigrants . Thus , when she left port she was ninety over complement , but since most of the passengers were charity cases , government inspectors smiled and wished her Good voyage ! ' She departed Southampton on 9 February 1820 on a gray , wintry day when the Channel looked more immense than the ocean , its waves far more menacing . For seven painful days the little craft tossed and pitched in waves that seemed determined to pull her to shreds , and all aboard who had not sailed before were convinced that they must perish . Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from India , reassured the cabin passen/gers that once the Bay of Biscay was reached , the passage would settle into a pleasant monotony in which the limited movement of the ship would be like a gentle lullaby , no worse . ' Especially pleased to hear this was the woman whose welfare lay in his hands . She did not accept the ' violent motion of the ship easily , and this irritated her , for she was grimly determined to make a brave show of it , ' as she had promised her mother she would , and when her stomach was wrenched into convulsions by her sickness , she was ashamed of herself . She was the sole occupant of the cabin next to her brother 's , as she called him , but he shared his with a captain going out to join the Gallant Fifty-ninth on the Afghan frontier , so that during the bad days she had two gentlemen to assist her . Sure enough , when the Alice Grace entered the great Bay of Biscay the storms subsided and the gentle , reassuring motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like the motion of the ship , as he was certain she would , and for the third and fourth week the three travelers had a congenial time together , with Richard discovering what a sterling person this Vera Lambton was . Her determination was obvious , her sense of humor reassuring . When children were ill , she acted as general nurse , and whenever any of the women passengers in steerage needed attention , she was eager to help . My brother 's getting a strong woman , Richard told himself , but because of a reticence which he could not have explained , he did not inform his cabin mate of Vera 's destination . She 's a family friend ' was all he 'd say . Heading out to South Africa . ' She 'd make some chap quite a decent wife , ' the captain observed several times , but since he was much younger than Vera , and since his regiment would not allow him to marry till he was thirty , his interest in her could only be that of an observer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last outpost of European civilization , the long reach to the bulge of Africa began , and now the three travelers began to be aware of a remarkable young man , a wagon builder by trade , who had more or less assumed command belowdecks . He was an attractive fellow , careful of his appearance even though the ship provided him no water for washing . His curly head and broad grin appeared wherever there was trouble . It was he who organized the teams that handled the slops ; he supervised the distribution of food ; and he sat as judge 's clerk when the rump court belowdecks handed out penalties for such infractions as theft or pummeling another passenger . Name 's Thomas Carleton , ' he told Saltwood and the captain when they asked if he could fix their door , which had come off its hinges during a blow . I can fix it , sirs . With wood I can fix anything , it seems . ' And as he worked , devising ingenious tools for getting around corners , he told them of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more importanttown of Saffron Walden , not far from Cambridge University , which he had once visited . He was a chatterbox , intensely excited about his prospects for starting a new life in the colonies : I can work eighteen hours a day and sleep four . Saffron Walden had prospects for everyone except me , so I kicked up me heels and was off to sea . The town 's a fascinating place , you understand . Named by the father of Henry VIII , him with the wives . One of the twop341places in England entitled to trade in saffron , precious stuff . It makes meat taste better , but in all me days I never took a pinch of it into me mouth . Reserved for rich people . ' Vera , returning to her cabin after a stroll on the minute deck  --  fifteen steps forward , fifteen back  --  heard this last observation and interrupted : Saffron 's a yellow powder , I think , and it 's not used for meat . It 's used for rice . ' She blushed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you men have been associated with it . ' Not I , not yet , ' the captain said gallantly . But she 's right , ' Richard said . Saffron is yellow  --  orange , really  --  and they do use it a great deal in India . You 'll grow to like it . ' While you 're here , ' Vera said to the wagon builder , could you fix the lock on my box ? The workmen threw it aboard , I 'm afraid . ' Thomas Carleton left the men 's cabin and moved a few paces to Vera 's , where , after one quick glance at the portmanteau in which she kept her dresses , he told her that a small piece of wood must be replaced so that the screws holding the hasp could catch . It 's no problem , ' he assured her , always providing we can find the wood . ' Together they made a quick tour of the deck , finding nothing , but when they went to the ' tween deck , where the ship 's carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was so small that the carpenter refused any payment from Vera : Take it and be blessed . ' He was giving it not to this amiable girl but to the wagon builder , whose good work among the passengers he had noted . When the box was fixed , Vera thanked the young man , four years her junior , and then talked with him about conditions belowdecks . She was by no means a philanthropist , as those seeking always to do good for others were called in England  --  those busybodies who were agitating against slaveryin Jamaica and child labor in Birmingham  --  because families like hers in Salisbury were too sensible for that . But she was interested in whatever was occurring on this tedious voyage , and on subsequent days she visited various parts of the ship with Carleton , and one night about half after ten the captain who occupied the bunk closest to the dividing wall in Richard 's cabin whispered , I say , Saltwood ! I think something interesting 's going on next door . ' Mind your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destroyed , so toward three in the morning , after assuring himself that the captain was asleep , he peered into the night and saw young Thomas Carleton , he of the glib tongue , slipping out of the next-door cabin and down the ladder to his proper place below . The next weeks , half of March and half of April , were a dismal time for Richard Saltwood ; it was apparent that Vera Lambton was entertaining the young man from belowdecks three and four times a week . During the day their behavior was circumspect . They spoke casually if they chanced to meet each other as he pursued his duties , but they betrayed no sign of intimacy . On one very hot day after the Cape Verdes had been passed and the ship was heading sharply southeastward , the ship 's captain summoned both Salt wood and the young officer to assist him in a court-martial ; the accusing official was young Carleton , who , as an officer in charge of maintainingdiscipline belowdecks , had brought charges against a pitiful specimenwho on four different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been shipped aboard after a chain of similar offenses in London , there could be only one logical verdict : Twelve lashes . ' And Thomas Carleton was charged with bringing on deck all the passengers so that they could see for themselves how crime was punished . When all were in place , ship 's officers led the convicted on deck , where he was stripped to the waist , tied with his arms about the mast , and lashed with a club from whose end dangled nine cattails of knotted leather . He made no sound till the fifth stroke , then cried pitifully and fainted . The last seven lashes were delivered to an inert body , after which he was sloshed with salt water . There was no more stealing . The flogging had a sobering effect upon theft belowdecks ; some of the passengers were a sorry lot , but most were from the sturdy and moral lower classes , women and men who would engage in no misconduct , and they rebuked those who did . One man , nearing fifty and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man hurried past one afternoon and pulled him into a corner . Laddie , ' he said bluntly , you 're treadin ' on very dangerous ground . ' What do you mean , old man ? ' Meddlin ' with a lady of quality , that 's what I mean . ' I 'm a man of quality , ' Thomas said quickly . I am as strong  --  ' Those men in the cabin next hers , they 're officers . They 'll shoot you in a minute , laddie . ' Those men are not involved with the lady , and take your hand down . ' This the older man refused to do . Instead he tightened it , saying , Laddie , this is a small ship . If I know , do n't you suppose they know ? ' For six days the warning deterred young Carleton from visiting Vera , and Richard sighed with relief at having avoided the necessity of interveningwhere his brother 's honor was involved . At night he listened for sounds that would betray an assignation , and was pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the seventh day he spotted Vera talking intently with the young wagon builder , and that night , about eleven , her door creaked open and someone slipped in . It was , in many ways , the worst night of Richard Saltwood 's life , for the lovers , having been separated for a week , clutched at each other with such passion and noisy delight that the young captain was awakened . I say , Saltwood , listen to this ! I say , like a pair of goats ! ' The noise of love-making could not be masked . There were rumblings of the bulkhead , the squeals of a woman who had waited till her twentyninthyear for love , and harsh pantings . Without even moving to the captain'sbed , Richard could hear the lascivious echoes , and after a long , wild ecstasy in the other room , when the captain said , I say , that 's prolonged ! ' confused Richard blurted out , And she 's going out to marry my brother ! ' In Saltwood 's room there was silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long time the captain asked in barrack-room accents , Well , whad'ja goin ' to do ? ' What do you mean ? ' Saltwood asked in the darkness . Damnit all , man . Are n't you goin ' to shoot him ? ' And Richard heard the hard clang of a revolver being slammed onto their table.  |p343It  was there when daylight came into the cabin , accusing him . He did not shave that morning , nor take any food . The young captain left him severely alone , but at midafternoon he returned , picked up the revolver , and banged it down again : Good God , man ! It 's your duty . Shoot the filthy blighter . ' When Richard was unable to respond , the young man said , ' I 'll testify . I 've heard everything , God knows . If you want to shoot ' em both , I 'll testify for that , too . ' But the Saltwoods of Salisbury were not a family that solved problems by shooting . In Parliament , Peter had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ridiculed the man into retreating . In the wilds of Illinois , young David had refused to gun down an Indian caught trespassing , although his neighbors shot them for much less . And in the South Atlantic , with storms rising as the coast of Africa hove into sight , Richard could not bring himself to shoot a young wagon builder and perhaps the man 's mistress as well . Instead he waited till dusk , then told his cabin mate to put away the revolver while he went next door to talk with his sister-inlaw , as she had sometimes phrased herself . ' Vera , your behavior 's been shameless . ' ' What do you mean ? ' she said , bristling . ' The bulkhead . It 's very thin . ' She looked at the wall in amazement , tapped upon it and heard nothing . ' We do n't make noises , the captain and I , ' Richard said . ' We 're gentlemen . ' She tapped again , whereupon the captain , lounging in bed , tapped back . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! ' she said , covering her face . ' Yes . The captain offered me his gun , wanted me to shoot you both . ' This had quite the opposite effect from what he had intended . Vera stiffened , lost any sense of contrition , and faced him boldly . ' I 'm in love , Richard . For the first time in my life I know something that you 've never known , will probably never know . What it 's like to be in love . ' ' You 're a foolish woman on a lonely ship .. Instead of attempting to defend herself , she laughed . ' Do n't you think I know that your poor little Hilary is sadly damaged ? That you 're desperate to find him a wife . . . to get him back on course ? I know that . Everyone knows it . ' ' Who told you ? ' ' Simon Keer . The Reverend Simon Keer . Oh , at the public meetings he extolled your brother . So did your mother . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said ? That Hilary 's a bit of an ass . Those were his words . He said I might be able to do something with him , the LMS certainly was n't able to . ' ' He told you that ? ' ' What else could he tell me , if I asked him in all honesty ? ' ' But Keer 's the reason . . . He sent Hilary to Africa . ' ' What he said was " Some young men , especially from Oxford ... " ' ' Natural envy from a man without an education . ' ... some young men from Oxford take religion too seriously . It addles them . " ' ' But Keer marches up and down England , lecturing about the missions . '  |p344He  does so for a purpose , Richard . He wants to end slavery . Does n't give a damn about religion . . . in the old sense . ' What do you mean ? ' And neither do I. ' The blasphemy staggered Saltwood , and he sat down abruptly , whereuponVera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , not her mother , who was desperate to find a husband . She loathed being a spinster , the afternoon teas , the sober dresses . Hilary , off in Africa , had been a last chance and she had grabbed at him . Your mother was so afraid I 'd be put off by the long sea voyage . ' She laughed nervously . I 'd have fought my way aboard this ship . It was my last chance . ' Richard had never heard a woman talk this way , had never imagined that a Lambton of Salisbury could . And now the girl was saying , The journey 's changed everything . You 're no longer responsible for me . I 'm going to marry Thomas . ' No minister would  --  ' Then we 'll marry ourselves . When we reach South Africa he 'll go to his land , and I 'll go with him . ' But Hilary will be there . Waiting . ' She did not even reply to that . She laughed in a way that caused her shoulders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled him to his feet , and helped him out the door . She would discuss the matter no further , and that night both Richard and the captain could again hear rumbles from the adjoining cabin . You goin ' to shoot ' em ? ' the captain asked . No ! No ! Stop such questions . ' Then I will . ' And there had to be a scuffle before Richard could wrest the captain 's revolver from him . But this did not deter the violent young man , who felt that somehow his honor , and that of his regiment , had been impugned , for he burst out of his cabin , knocked loudly on the adjoining door , and demanded that Carleton go below to your proper quarters , damn you . ' When the young wagon builder tried to slip past , the captain swung a mighty blow at his head , knocking him down the ladder . I hope he broke his neck , ' the officer growled as he returned to bed , and after some painful moments of silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand why you had to leave the regiment . You were a disgrace to the uniform . ' For two days he refused to speak to his cabin mate , but on the third day , with tears in his eyes , he clasped Saltwood 's hand as if they were brothers and said , Richard , dear boy , is there anything I can do to help ? ' There is , ' Saltwood replied in deep gratitude . When we stop at Cape Town , have that miserable blighter thrown ashore . I promised Mother I 'd deliver this girl to Hilary , and by God , I shall , damaged or not . ' So when the Alice Grace put in for replenishing , none of the passengers belowdecks were allowed ashore , for they were docketed to Algoa Bay , three weeks more sailing along the coast . But the young wagon builder who had dared to make love to a lady of quality was thrown onto the wharf , with his axes and angles , while the lady of quality wept for him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said with tierce determi/nation , You must go on to Hilary . As you promised Mother . ' And all the time the Alice Grace stayed in Cape Town , she was kept prisoner in her cabin , guarded by the brother-in-law who stood guard outside , relinquishinghis position to the captain when sleep was necessary . Even when the governor invited all the captain 's guests to a gala , she was not allowed to attend lest she meet with Thomas Carleton and run away . She remained in her cabin even when the ship resumed its journey , as did everyone else who had one , for a wintry gale blew up , driving the vessel far south , reminding the sailors of Adamastor , the tempestuous giant who guarded the Cape in the time of Vasco da Gama , and of whom Luis de Camoens had written with such brilliance . Day after day the winds raged , forcing waves so high across the bow of the ship that they flooded cabins . At times the vessel plunged downward in such steep and sickening falls that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shrieks and wails competed with the howling winds . Sleep was impossible and food unthinkable ; at numerous times , when her wet and lonely cabin shivered as if its bulkhead might splinter , Vera huddled in a corner , fearful of the moment when the voyage would end , terrified of its continuance , but never did she give way to superstition and castigate herself or her actions with Thomas as being in any way the cause of this violent storm . She was glad she had known him , even for just their brief passage through the tropics , and she prayed that in some mysterious way she might meet him again . Alone , at the heart of a shattering tempest , she changed from being a meek English spinster and became a mature woman with a surprisingly independent mind . She had enjoyed being loved by a strong man and realized that she could never return to the dreamy afternoons of a cathedral town . As for marrying a missionary , that was quite impossible , but what she would do she did not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could have torn it apart , she clung to her bed to prevent being swept away and cried , If we make land , I 'm an African . ' And she shook her fist in some wild direction , supposing the storm-girt continent to lie in that quarter . On the seventh day of the storm , when the little barque was well down toward polar waters , passengers began reciting old tales of ships , rudderless and sails gone , being driven relentlessly southward till ice entrappedthem , holding them forever in its embrace : A graveyard of ships down there , masts erect . Everyone aboard frozen stiff and standingerect till judgment day . ' They told also of the Flying Dutchman : Captain van der Decken , out of Rotterdam . One of his great-grandsons settled at the Cape years ago . Swore he could round the Cape in a storm like this , swore an oath to do so . He 's out there somewhere , still trying to breast the Cape , and will be till the people frozen down there are called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when the storm finally abated and the sun allowed the captain to calculate his position , all were shocked to learn how far south they had been driven ; they were indeed on their wayp346to the ice , and now , as they turned north toward Algoa Bay , they were humbled and chastened in spirit , so that even the young captain felt remorse at the way he had wanted to treat the awakened young woman in the cabin next to him , and he knocked on her door to apologize . I 'm sorry , ' he said . I 'm not , ' she replied . In the storm , ' the captain confided , I thought once or twice we must surely sink . And do you know what I thought next ? ' He smiled at her engagingly , a man much younger than herself , endeavoring to reach understanding . I thought how utterly insane I 'd been to interfere in your affairs . I wanted to shoot you , you know . ' I was told . ' Madam , would you allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whom you love makes no difference to others . ' And to her astonishment , he fell to one knee , took her hand  --  and kissed it . The scene at Algoa Bay in the winter of 1820 was one of historic confusion , confusion because five ships like the Alice Grace were trying to unload passengers in the open roadstead without a wharf to aid them , historic because a whole new type of person was coming ashore to add a new dimension to South African life . The confusion was monumental , both in the bay and ashore . Captains endeavored to anchor their ships as securely as possible , but wind and tide tossed them vigorously , so that anyone trying to debark was in peril . Long ropes were led ashore through the water ; they would be used to haul the boats to the beach . Women and children , of which there were aplenty , were crowded into the rude boats and taken ashore through the surf . Occasionallya boat broke loose to wander off , passengers screaming , until some stout-hearted swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven thousand miles to their destination , flatly refused to debark , trusting neither the frail boats nor the men guiding them , but bellowed orders from the ship 's officers usually forced them loose from the railings to which they clung ; a few had to be dropped bodily into the tossing boats , and these ran the risk of broken limbs . Some daring children , unable to wait any longer to reach the paradise about which they had been constantly told , leaped gaily into the water as the lighters neared the beach , gasped and spat and spluttered toward shore , screaming their delight . Their mothers watched anxiously till they were lifted out of the water and onto the shoulders of men who would carry them through the surf . Among those who helped the immigrants to safety were some Xhosa who only a year before had flung themselves against Grahamstown . Ashore the confusion worsened : The party from Manchester , over here ! Liverpool , over there ! Glaswegians , stay by that dune . Please , please ! The Cardiff people must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Dashing from one end of the beach to the other , instructing everyone what to do , was Colonel Cuyler of Albany , New York , now in charge of a much more pleasant task . But even here the energetic man encountered troubles , for the government had appointed him to instruct the immigrants in harshp347facts overlooked in England when the glories of South Africa were being extolled : This is not yet a land of milk and honey . It 's a land of guns . Never , never go into your fields without your muskets . ' In addition to the scrambling immigrants , the shore was cluttered with Boer farmers who had driven in , from sixty and seventy miles away , in heavy wagons pulled by fourteen or sixteen or twenty oxen , and these men forced hard bargains with the newcomers , offering to cart them and their possessions to their new homes for outrageous prices . But what alternative did the immigrants have ? So day after day wagons were loaded , whips were cracked , and teams of stolid oxen began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting crowd ashore was Reverend Hilary Saltwood , come to greet his bride . He was still extraordinarily thin and visibly entering middle age , for he was thirty-five and showed the effects of his hard life . He was certainly not an attractive bridegroom , and few women would have sailed so far to claim him , but when his present duties ended and he could be got back to England for some fattening up , and settled in some quaint rural parish , he might prove acceptable . The outstanding thing in his favor was the gleam that suffused his face : it was the countenance of a man who believed in what he was doing and found constant reassurance in the honesty of his calling . He loved people ; his expedition to Grahamstown with the commando had taught him even to love the Boers who opposed him so vigorously , and the fact that he had fought well against the Xhosa warriors had earned him respect , so that the ox wagon that waited to take his bride to Golan Mission had been volunteered by Tjaart van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild confusion : the tall darksuitedmissionary so ill-at-ease ; the short , squared-off Boer with the heavy beard ; the sixteen lumbering oxen indifferent to the whole affair . Dear God ! ' Hilary cried . It 's Richard ! ' And he ran to the beach to embrace his brother coming wet and dripping out of the waves . Where 's the lady ? ' Hilary asked in some apprehension , forgetting to introduce Van Doorn , who stood nearby , testing his hippopotamus-hide whip . She 'll be coming , ' Richard said . Who 's this ? ' Oh , this is my neighbor , Tjaart van Doorn . ' You live at the mission ? ' Thirty miles north . ' Richard blinked . Neighbors at thirty miles ? But then he heard a shout from the Alice Grace 's lighter . It was the captain , with Vera Lambton beside him : Richard ! Ho , Saltwood ! Here comes the bride ! ' His cry was so hearty , and the message so warm in this scene of new lives beginning , that everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambton , who looked quite pretty in her rough traveling clothes . Three cheers went up as the lighter was slowly pulled ashore , strong hands grasping the rope and guiding it to the beach . Ashore , men quickly learned that she was the intended of Reverend Saltwood , and cheers were raised in his behalf . Even Tjaart van Doorn , moved by the spectacle of a wife arriving in such manner , relaxed andp348clapped the minister on the back : Exciting , eh ? ' And he moved forward to help bring his neighbor 's betrothed ashore . In the boat Vera sat rigid , her eyes down ; she did not want to scan the shore lest she see the missionary she had been sent to marry . She did not want him , her heart lay elsewhere , and she doubted she could ever mask that fact ; but the fierce rejection she had voiced during the storm had subsided , and now , faced with the prospect of making her way alone in a strange continent , she supposed that she must accept him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the last moment she looked up , and what she saw banished all her fears  --  and although she endangered herself , she stood up in the boat , waved both hands , and screamed , Thomas ! ' Thomas Carleton , wagon builder of Saffron Walden , had galloped at breakneck speed across the flats , across the mountains and the long reaches , to intercept the boat , and there he stood , arms outstretched , to greet his love . Disdaining the hands that waited to lead her onto dry land , Vera leaped into the shallow water , lifted her skirts , and ran through the waves , throwing her arms wide to embrace the one man she could ever love . She was twenty-nine , he twenty-five ; she was educated in Bible , painting and music , he in wood-handling ; but they were joyously committed to living in South Africa the rest of their lives . They were the English settlers of 18zo . Vera 's arrival in this dramatic manner dominated the attention of everyone , even Richard Saltwood , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left standing alone , off with the oxen and the waiting wagon that would never carry his bride to the mission . Gradually people on the shore became aware of him , and turned to look at the forlorn figure , and as they did so , they broke into laughter . Harsh words were thrown , and ribald ones , and he stood apart , allowing them to fall over him like a cascade of icy water . He sought condolence from no one , nor did he try in any way to dissuade Miss Lambton from her extraordinary behavior . He could not guess what had precipitated it , but he was sure it must have been an emotion of powerful force , and certainly it was God 's will that she should go with the other and not with him . He did not demur when Tjaart came back and said apologetically , Since I 'm here , I 'll cart the couple to their new home . . . if it 's all right with you . ' That 's what you should do , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he , too , must find a carter and be on his way , Hilary nodded . In the end , all the immigrants found transportation of some kind or other and were off to try raising wheat and mealies on land that could scarcely grow weeds ; the government had not been entirelyhonest with these settlers , neither in Cape Town nor in London . They were not supposed to be farmers and merchants in the old sense ; they were to form forward hedgehogs of self-defense along the border , keeping the Xhosa away from the established farms farther inland . Vera and Thomas , in their frontier home , were supposed to take the brunt of any Xhosa attack , so that established settlements like Grahamstown could exist in safety. llilary , who understood this conniving strategy , was saddened to see hisp349intended bride and his brother heading eastward into such a situation , and as he stood alone he prayed for them , that God would give them strength for the trials that lay ahead . That done , he watched their wagons disappear , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would never forget 1820 . For him it was a year of tragedy , with both the Boer and the English communities sneering at him , not even conceding that he was a well-intentioned dominee . His mission was characterized as a farce where blacks could escape honest work ; his attempts at agriculture were pitiful ; and his constant insistence that Hottentot and Xhosa be given fair treatment was seen as weakness of character . The Boers despised him for his antagonism to coerced labor , the backbone of their existence , while the English dismissed him as socially unacceptable . His position worsened whenever Dr. Keer , in London , issued a new publication or caused an inquiry to be made in Parliament . The little agitator was finding that his diatribes against the Boers were popular with the English press and his passkey to the highest ranks of English society . He wrote and preached and lectured , uttering the most inflammatory accusationsagainst the Boers , but whenever he thundered from the safety of London , the lightning struck Hilary Saltwood in his exposed mission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place . He seemed sublimely indifferent to the ostracism and to the threats . He maintained a kind of Christian charity at his mission , accepting all who stumbled in , finding them clothes and food in unlikely quarters . He kept the converts working , more or less , and spent much time with the choir , believingthat a soul that sang was closer to God than one that brooded in silence , and many travelers of that period wrote amusingly of coming to Golan and hearing at evening prayers a glorious choir singing old English hymns , all faces dark except that of the missionary , which stood a good foot higher than the others . The writers always implied that Saltwood was out of place , but that was not accurate . He belonged with these people . It may have been that God devised this loneliness , when all white men scorned him , so that his attention could be focused on the future of South Africa ; at any rate , one night as he lay sleepless he was vouchsafed a vision of such crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his parishioners . He spoke in a melange of English , Dutch , Portuguese and Xhosa : With the coming of our English cousins , and in such numbers , we can see that this land can henceforth never be of one unit . It must always be broken into fragments , many different people , many differentlanguages . We stand this morning , in 1821 , like a river moving along the crest of a ridge . Sooner or later it must come down one side or other , and how it comes will make all the difference in this land . Let us pray that it will come tumbling joyously down as a cascade of love and brotherhood , in which Hottentot and Xhosa and Englishman and Boer share the work and the rewards . Golan Missionmust no longer be for blacks alone . We must open our hearts to all people , our school to all children . Here he frowned . I cannotp350believe that our great river of humanity will go rushing down the wrong side of the mountain , creating a hateful society in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their separate ways in bitter little streams , each off to itself . For we are all brothers in God and He intended that we work and live together . ' Among his listeners that morning , when he shared his vision of a new South Africa , were many who could not comprehend what he was talking about ; common sense told them that white men who had wagons and guns and many horses were intended to rule and to have lesser people work for them . But there were a few who understood that what the missionary was saying was true , not at this moment perhaps , but in the long reach of a man 's whole life , or perhaps within the lives of his grandchildren . Among this latter group was the gifted soprano Emma , whose family had escaped slavery through Hilary 's charity , or rather his mother 's , for she had sent the funds which purchased their release . Emma was now twentyone , smallish in size , and her face was as jet-black as ever , her teeth even and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children , and guided the mission whenever Saltwood had to be absent . For some time she had been thinking of Golan 's future , and because she was a Madagascan and not a Xhosa , she was able to see more clearly than some . She found the Xhosa in general a superior people , and could name a dozen ways in which they excelled : Baas , they could be as good farmers or hunters as any Boer . ' Never , never call me Baas again , ' Hilary admonished . I am your friend , not your baas . ' She was aware , of course , that Hilary had gone to Algoa Bay to fetch a wife , and speedy rumors had reached even Golan , describing the hilarious scene in which he had stood on the shore , arms open to receive his woman , while she ran right past him to embrace another . Emma , better than most , appreciated the agony this sensitive man must have known then , and upon his return she had discharged most of the managerial duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury it . Emma , with no last name , understood the subtle process by which Saltwood had sublimated his personal grief and found , in doing so , his vision of South Africa as a whole , and she supposed that no one would ever understand this country , in which she , like Hilary , was a stranger , until he had experienced some sense of tragedy . She supposed also that once he expressed his vision , he would see its impossibility and would shortly thereafterleave the area and return to England , which must lie very far away . So she was surprised one day , and perhaps pleased , when he said , I shall stay here the rest of my life . I 'm needed for the building . ' She believed him , and knowing this , moved closer to him , for it was apparent that no man as fragile as he could survive without strong assistance , and she further observed that he was held in such scorn by the two white communities that there was little possibility that he could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some respects , even more solidly informed than Saltwood himself and exercised a sounder judgment , and this had been true when shep351was ten and realized that her life depended upon escaping from slavery at De Kraal . Her parents had been afraid ; the other slaves , all of them , had been terrified of consequences ; but she had fled into the night without horse or guide and had made her way to freedom . Now it was she who saw that Hilary must have a partner , and she perceived this on the simplest base : that he could not survive without one . Reverend Saltwood , after his vision and his willingness to commit his life to it , was thinking along much different lines . He felt that God had brought him to Golan for some specific and perhaps noble purpose , and he was sure that it was God who had vouchsafed him the vision ; in this respect he was much like Lodevicus the Hammer , except that Lodevicus had known that God had visited him personally . Therefore , if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conform to the inherent patterns of that design  --  and what were they ? That all men in South Africa were brothers , that all were equal in the sight of God and that all had just rights , none standing higher than another . He recognized that there were managerial degrees , and he was certainly no revolutionary ; in the Missionary Society , for example , he stood on the very lowest rung of the hierarchy , and in his humility he suspected that he deserved little more . In Cape Town lived officials who gave him orders , and in London lived other officials who sent orders to South Africa , and above all , stood the little group of powerful thinkers like Simon Keer who directed everything . He was quite satisfied with the abstract structure , but he was somewhat troubled by the fact that everyone in the chain of command was white , as if this were a prerequisite for power . At Golan he had delegated command and it had worked rather well . He had turned the mission choir over to Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a beautiful instrument , not he . He had found that in his absences Emma had run the establishment at least as well as he , and perhaps better . She certainly was as good a Christian , having braved true hardships in forging her allegiance to Jesus , and she was kind and humble in dealing with Boers when they came to complain about their runaways . Humble , but firm , ' he wrote in one report , she displays the true sense of Christ 's teaching . If she is required to face down some arrogant Boer screaming for the return of his Hottentots , she stands there , a little figure in a gingham dress , hands on hips , defying them to desecrate the house of the Lord . One man thrashed her with his whip , but she would not move , and in some confusion he rode away . ' Another line of thought was pushing its way into Saltwood 's reflections , and he would have been astonished if its historic parallel had been pointed out to him , but like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers of persons of inferior mechanical culture , he was beginning to think that salvation lay in rejecting the inherited superior culture and marrying some simple woman from the less advantaged , and in so doing , establishing connection with the soil , with the elementary . Thus , at this very time in Russia young men of the ruling class were coming to believe that they must marry serfs to attain contact with the real Russia , and in France writers and philosophers contemplated marriage to fallen women , so that together they might start from a solid base , as it were , and climb to new understandings . In Brazil gruff Portuguesep352planters defiantly married blacks : To hell with Lisbon . This is my life henceforth . ' And in India certain mystic-driven young Englishmen were thinking that to understand the land to which they were now committed , they must take Indian wives . There was a sense of self-flagellation in all this , and many observers were amused by it , but there was also a sense of primordial experience , of identification with a new land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture marked by too many books and far too many parties , something fundamental was being lost . When religion , with its example of Jesus Christ 's abnegation , was thrown into the scales , there built up a solid impulse toward actions that would never otherwise have been contemplated , and one bright morning when life at Golan Mission was as placid as it would ever be , Reverend Hilary Saltwood entered upon three days of prayer and fasting . He was thirty-six now , and as far in promotions as he would ever go . He was aware that his mother still fondly imagined him coming home to the deanship at Salisbury , but he knew that lustrous prize was lost forever ; indeed , he sometimes doubted that he could even secure some inconspicuousEnglish living . He suspected also that his term at Golan had better be ended ; he had built so well that any new man from London could take charge . But his productive life was by no means finished ; he felt an urgent call to the north , where many lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in one lonely outpost after another . But to live like that he needed a companion . He remembered how excited he had been when his mother wrote that she was sending him a wife . How often he had read that letter , how carefully he had studied his mother 's description of Miss Lambton , visualizing her working with him in outpost stations . In his loneliness he would sometimes recall every item of her dress as she came through the surf that day in Algoa Bay . I need a wife to share the veld , ' he cried aloud . But what wife ? Dare he ever again enlist his mother in a search ? He thought not . Could he ride over to Grahamstown to see if it contained any eligible women , new widows , perhaps , among the immigrants ? Not likely . There they would laugh at him and jeer , and no woman would want to share that humiliation . Should he return to Cape Town ? Never . Never . His life was on the frontier with the black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marvelous little assistant with the laughingeyes ? He believed he did , but he wondered whether God would approve of such a union . His thinking thus far had required one full day ; he spent the next two in trying to ascertain whether a man totally devoted to Jesus Christ dared risk such a marriage , and just as the Boers searched the Old Testament for guidance in their time of tribulation , so he took down the New Testament and tried to decipher the teachings of Jesus and St. Paul , and the old familiar phrases leaped and tumbled in contradiction through his mind : It is better to marry than to burn . . . He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord . Husbands , love your wives . . . It is good for a man not to touch a woman . . . So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies , ' and St. Paul 's specific command to celibacy : I say therefore to the unmarried , " It is good for them if they abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generated in a time when people were living in agitated communities much like the South Africa of 1821 , and a searcher could find Biblical justification for either marrying or not marrying , but in the end one incident in the New Testament superseded all others : when a poor couple in Cana were being married without enough money to provide wine for their guests , Jesus stepped forward and converted water into wine so that the celebration could proceed . Laughter possessed Hilary when he thought of it : I 've always liked that miracle best of all . A celebration . A blessing . And at the end the governor himself saying , At most parties they serve good wine at the beginning , rubbish as soon as the guests are drunk . But you 've brought us the best wine at the end . Stout fellow ! ' I believe that Jesus and his disciples must have danced at this wedding . He spent the third night praying , and in the morning he went to Emma and said , Jesus Himself would dance at our wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly by Saul , who now served as deacon at the mission  --  this tall white man , this short black woman . They shared a wattledhut beside the church , and since no announcements were broadcast , news of the extraordinary marriage did not circulate . It certainly did not reach Grahamstown , seventy-five miles to the east , where Richard Saltwood had found himself a saucy bride , Julie , the Dorset girl who had ridden her own horse to Plymouth to take passage on one of the last emigrant ships . Alone and unprotected , she lacked the funds to hire a sixteen-oxen wagon to freight her to Grahamstown , so she had walked , bringing with her barely more than the clothes on her back . Within a week six men had wanted to marry her , and in her flirtatious way she had chosen Richard . She could not read , but when he explained that one day he would take her back to the cathedral town of Salisbury , she said brightly , Then , by God , I better learn , ' and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two women , so unlike in breeding , so similar in courage , had a fine time wrestling with the alphabet . When Richard proposed that he send for his brother to conduct the wedding , Julie cried , Capital ! It 'll give us a chance to introduce him to the town . ' So a servant was sent west on horseback to invite Hilary to perform the ceremony , and the invitation seemed so sincere and the opportunity to establish connections with the new settlement so favorable that the missionaryaccepted . He would take Emma with him so that the Grahamstown people could witness the depth of his conviction that a new era was beginningin the colony . Hilary , Emma , Saul and the servant made the eastward journey , with Bible reading each evening , prayers each dawn , and much conversation about Richard and his experiences in India . Hilary , having found great happiness in his own marriage , speculated on what kind of bride his brother was taking , and in his prayers repeatedly asked God to bless Richard . As the quartet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had seemed like secure fortresses that day when he faced the screaming Xhosa , and he showed Emma the site on which Tjaart van Doorn had saved his life . As they rode down the principal street they came to the spacious parade ground where a small church stood on land which would be occupied laterp354by a fine cathedral , and another of Richard 's Hottentot servants hailed the procession to say that Baas was at the shop of Carleton , the wagon builder , so the horses were turned in that direction while the slave hurried on ahead , shouting , De Reverend kom ! Look , he kom ! ' And to the door of the rude shed in which Carleton worked came his wife , his friend Richard Saltwood and lively Julie , the intended bride . All four looked up at the horsemen and saw Hilary sitting high among them . Hullo , Hilary , ' Richard said with the casualness that had always marked his behavior toward his brother . Glad you could come . ' Hello , Richard . I hear God has blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . This is my wife , Emma . ' From her horse the petite Madagascan smiled warmly at the two women , then nodded to their men . She remembered them later as four gaping mouths : They were astounded , Hilary . Did n't you see them , four mouths wide open ? ' No one spoke . Emma , with a deep sense of propriety , felt that it was not her duty to do so first , since she was being presented to them , but they were too dumbstruck even to speak to Hilary , let alone his extraordinary wife . Finally the missionary said , We 'd better dismount , ' and he extended his hand to his wife . The story sped through Grahamstown : That damned fool Saltwood 's married a Xhosa bitch . ' It was an agonizing three days . No one knew where to put Emma , or how to feed her , or what to say to her . They were surprised to learn that she could speak good English and write much better than Julie . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no way to alleviate the awfulness of her reality , no explanation that could soften the dreadful fact that a decent Englishman , although a missionary , had married one of his Xhosa Kaffirs . When it was pointed out that she was really a Madagascan , one man said , Know the place well . The bastards ate my uncle . ' And now a rumor circulated that Emma had been a cannibal . Richard quietly insisted that the marriage proceed as planned , with his brother officiating , and the temporary church was crowded , most of the spectators having come to see the cannibal . It was a moving ceremony , filled with the soaring phrases of the Church of England wedding ritual , perhaps the most loving in the civilized world . Dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of God , and in the face of this company , to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony ; which is an honourable state , instituted of God in the time of man 's innocency . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of Galilee . . . Wilt thou love her , comfort her , honour , and keep her in sickness and in health . . . so long as ye both shall live . . . forsaking all others . . . for better for worse , for richer for poorer , in sickness and in health , to love and to cherish , till death us do part .. When Hilary intoned these mighty words , standing tall and gaunt , like someone St. Paul might have ordained in Ephesus , he gave them specialp355meaning , for it seemed to him that he was solemnizing not only his brother 's marriage but his own , and when he came to the cry , " O Lord save thy servant and thy handmaid ! " ' he felt that he was asking blessing upon himself , and some of the congregation suspected this and looked with horrid fascination at Emma , wondering if she could qualify as a handmaiden whose fate concerned God . The highlight of the ceremony came with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Prayer , for then little Emma , who stood facing the crowded church , let her voice soar as she did at the mission , and other singers stopped to listen : O let the nations rejoice and be glad : for thou shalt judge the folk righteously , and govern the nations upon earth . ' The congregants heard the song but not the words . On the return trip Hilary said , It was a dreadful mistake to have come . They saw nothing . They understood nothing . ' What did you think when you met Vera ? ' It was strange . I 'd never seen her , you know . Not really . I moved forward . She moved back . And I thought , " How lucky I was not to have married her . " ' You never had the chance , ' Emma said . I 'm convinced God took care of that . He had you in mind . ' I liked Thomas very much , ' she said . He 'll do well in this country . We need wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Why ? ' Because we 've got to move north . We 're not wanted here any longer . ' So when they reached Golan and satisfied themselves that Saul could maintain the mission with Hottentot and Xhosa deacons until some young clergyman arrived from England , they started packing in earnest . They acquired a small wagon and sixteen oxen , a tent of sorts and some wooden boxes for their goods . With this meager equipment they set forth . They headed northwest for a destination unknown , one man , one woman traversing barren lands that held no water , moving into canyons where desperadoes might be lurking , and crossing lands often ravaged by wandering bands of Hottentot and Bushmen outlaws . They had no fear , because they carried almost nothing of value that could be taken from them , and if they were to be slain , it would be in God 's service . They were traveling to take His word into a new land , and they would maintain their steady progress for fifty days . Alone , walking slowly beside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever penetrated before . In later decades much would be made of treks conducted by large groups of Boers armed with guns , and these would indeed be remarkable adventures , but equally so were the unspectacular movements of solitary English missionaries as they probed the wilderness , these lonely harbingers of civilization . By accident , and surely not by design , the Saltwoods came at last intop356that bleak northern country which had provided refuge to the slaves Jango and Deborah , who had fled here with their children . The land was now occupied by a few Bushmen , a few Hottentots who led a vagrant life after their last herds had been bartered away , quite a few runaway slaves from various parts of the world , and a scattering of ill-defined ne'er-do-wells and outcasts . In the veins of these fugitives there was Dutch blood aplenty , German , too , from settlers and sailors off ships , and not a little contributed by English officers on their way home from India and freed during their Cape Town leaves from the confines of British respectability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairest white , the last being provided by the new missionary , Hilary Saltwood of Oxford . He had settled on land in the northern part of the Great Karroo , that rolling semi-desert which occupied so much of the country . It was a thirstlandwhose treeless expanse frightened most people but enchanted those who found refuge here . The Saltwoods built their meager hartebeest hut close to a meandering stream , which went dry much of the year . When it was finished , they surrounded it with a thicket of protective thorn , exactly as Australopithecus had done five million years earlier . The site would have seemed quite miserable , except for the cluster of five hills , each separated from all the others , perfectly round at the base , handsomely leveled off at the top . Their beauty lay in their symmetry , their classic purity of form ; from a distance they resembled five judges huddling for an opinion , but from within their circles  --  say at the entrance to the missionaries ' hut  --  they became protective sentinels guarding the Karroo from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titanic storms that swept across it . When a man elected to serve God at this forsaken spot , he had the presence of God with him at all times . One traveler , standing at the door to Saltwood 's hut , avowed that he could see north to portals of heaven and west to the gates of hell without spotting a human being . ' He was , of course , wrong . In various nooks and secret places families had their huts . Behind the flat-topped hills there were whole villages whose residents hunted small animals for their hides , great ones for their ivory tusks . Others traded to the north , crossing the Karroo to where substantial numbers of people congregated . And others , with remarkable diligence , actually farmed the area  --  one hundred and fifty acresto feed one sheep  --  and found it profitable . One man mended wagons for customers as far distant as a hundred miles . But everyone in the Karroo shared in one miracle , and joyously . When spring rains came to this arid land , usually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of them in a sweeping carpet of many hues . It seemed as if nature had hidden here her leftover colors , waiting for the proper moment to splash them upon the world . In one of his sermons Hilary Saltwood said , The stars in heaven , the flowers on the Karroo , they 're God 's reminder that He stays with us . ' His duties were many . It was he who marked with ritual the passages of life : to christen , to marry , to bury . He served as arbitrator in family brawling . He taught school . His wife was general nurse to the scattered community . Messages were left at his rectory , the hut by the water pan , and he counseled with all who sought advice on anything . He helped at brand/ings , attended slaughterings in the hope that he might come home with a leg of something . And he participated in extended hunts when food was needed . He was a vicar of the veld . But most of all he conducted services , in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He read from the New Testament , lingering on its revolutionary messages of social justice , equality and brotherhood . In simple terms , devoid of cant , he talked with his people about new fashions of living in which all men would share responsibility , and he bore constant testimony to the fact that black and white could live together in harmony : That the white man is temporarily in a position of command becauseof his gun , his horse and his wagon is as nothing in the eyes of the Lord , or in the passage of history . How brief is the life of man . A hundred years from now it may be the black man who will be in a position of authority , and how little that too will matter in the eyes of the Lord . White man up , black man up , the perpetual problems remain . Where do I get my food to eat ? How do I pay my taxes ? Am I safe at night when I go to sleep ? Can my children learn the lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seek , and it matters not who is powerful and who weak , because in the great rolling away of history , all things change but the fundamentals . ' Whenever he spoke like this on Sunday morning , he spent Sunday afternoon wondering about the education of his own children . He and Emma now had three dark-skinned rascals , with their father 's height and their mother 's flashing white teeth . They were bright children , masters of the alphabet at five and their numbers at six . With others in the area , they studied with Emma and took their catechism from Hilary ; some of these children were instrumental in bringing their parents to the mission , encouraging them to go through the motions of worship , and all participated when Reverend Saltwood organized a picnic with games and songs and food . Then the young ones , twenty or thirty of them , of every shade , would venture outside the five hills and play on land that reached forever . A dozen kinds of antelope would watch from a distance , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chilling thunder . Adults always sought permission to join these safaris , and sometimes it seemed as if they enjoyed the outings more than their children , especially when great flocks of ostrich loped past or when boys found a settlement of meerkats . Then there was joy indeed as everyone gathered to watch the furry little animals scamper to their burrows , stand upright to see who was watching , and duck swiftly below ground . Meerkats are like people , ' Emma told the children , they must run around , but they 're happiest when they go back into their homes . ' Hilary could find in the Bible no precedent for a picnic , and he sometimes wondered if he was sponsoring a pagan ritual . There was no instance in which Jesus had participated in such a gathering , but the missionary felt sure that the Master would have approved this glowing combination of fellowship in watching the meerkats and reverence in singing the hymns that followed . And one night he asked Emma , Is n't it possible that thep358miracle of the loaves and fishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the children be allowed to come to Him . Maybe the Cana wedding guests assembled on the side of some hill in Galilee . ' Such days imparted a happiness that Hilary had never known before . His wife was a woman of infinite richness ; her children were a joy ; the tattered people who comprised his congregation loved his curious manners and forgave his intrusions into their spiritual lives ; and the great , barren land , once one became accustomed to it , provided a congenial home . Best of all , there were no Boers and Englishmen contesting for power , no social stigma because this man was white , that woman black . And then the relative peace was broken by Dr. Simon Keer , thundering back to South Africa to collect incidents to be used in another book . He was in his fifties now , at the apex of his political power and a furious fighter for causes worthy of his support . He had recently assumed leadership of the philanthropic movement , as it was now called , and had learned how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery oratory and dramatic examples of Boer misconduct . His first book , The Truth About South Africa , had run its course , and he felt he could best inflame opinion by producing a sequel showing that the horrors of Dutch occupancy at the Cape still persisted , even though Englishmen of higher moral standards held the reins of government . A supporter had given him a generous loan to fund this trip , counting upon Dr. Keer 's sensationalism to cover the investment . In short , the volcanic little man had found in the philanthropic movementhis golden Ophir , and he was coming back to South Africa to increase his treasure . Wherever he went he caused turmoil , lecturing the locals about morality , threatening them with the laws his friends in Parliament were about to pass , and accusing the Boer farmers of crimes that would have been rejected even by the Black Circuit of 1812 . Always he made the confrontation one between the honest Englishmen of the empire and the dishonest Boers of the backveld , and when one man who had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean said in public meeting , Do n't come preaching to us . Clean up your own islands , ' he silenced the man with the thundering response : Your observation is irrelevant . ' When rumors circulated that two Boers had tried to assassinate him at Swellendam , his audiences increased in size , as did his fury ; he was certainly not without courage , for he took his message to all parts of the colony , and in due course he convoked at Grahamstown a meeting of all LMS personnel , and when messengers had ridden to the outposts , a strange , ungainly group of men and women began to straggle in . They were the forward agents of God , an impassioned , dedicated , unlikely lot made old before their time by the bleak conditions under which they lived , but intensified in their beliefs by the problems they had succeeded in solving . Strangest of all the couples were the Saltwoods of Great Karroo , he walking in long strides , staff in hand , his black wife riding a small horse . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of meeting the leaders of their calling . When they entered the thriving mercantilecenter the first sign they saw was THOMAS CARLETON , WAGON RUHLDER . It was a real building now , with stone walls , tiled roof ; in fact ,  |p359it  was two buildings , one the foundry and carpenter 's shop , the other a sturdy house . We must halt here , ' Hilary said , anxious to try to heal any wounds that might still exist between him and the man who had stolen his bride . Hello , Thomas ! ' he called , and when the builder appeared at the door of his forge , Hilary was astonished to see how the years that had handled him so roughly had scarcely touched this bright-faced young man . I 'm Saltwood , ' Hilary said hesitantly . Why , so it is ! Vera , come here ! ' And from the house beside the shop came the former Miss Lambton of Salisbury , now a matron with two blond children . No longer the timid spinster studying watercolors , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeper of accounts for her husband 's thriving business . Good morning , Hilary , ' she said graciously . Then , with a mischievousnessshe could never have disclosed back in Wiltshire , she teased : You 're the reason I sailed so far . ' Are these your children ? ' They are . ' I have three now , ' he said quietly . We have n't stopped , you know , ' Carleton said , putting his arm about his wife . Has my brother any little ones ? ' Like all of us . He has one . ' During this colloquy Emma had remained on her horse , quietly to the rear , and now Vera cried warmly , Here is your wife ! ' It is . Emma , as you know . ' The wagon builder helped her alight , took her by both hands , and asked , Did n't you tell us you 're a Madagascan ? ' I did . ' How in the world did you get down here ? ' I was born here , ' she said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . But my parents were . . . How do you say it , Hilary ? ' Kidnapped . ' They were kidnapped by Portuguese slavers . It was quite common . Still is , I think . ' Little woman like you , three children ! ' Carleton shook his head and returned to his work . In the days prior to Dr. Keer 's arrival , the Karroo couple participated in many friendly meetings like this , for the indignation caused by their marriage had abated . Grahamstown was now a typical rural English settlementwith a thriving marketplace to which many Boer wagons came . They were heartily welcomed , not only for their trade but also because of the commandos they provided whenever untamed Kaffirs from across the Fish River attacked . Hilary overheard one tough English farmer joking with a Boer : After we were here eighteen months , and the Kaffirs had attacked us once and you Boers five times , our minister said on Sunday , " See how the heathen restrain themselves in the face of God ! They always prefer to raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church cried , " It is n't God , Dominee . It 's cattle . We do n't have any and the Boers do ! " ' Hilary was particularly pleased to renew acquaintance with his brother Richard , whose exuberant wife Julie had undergone a transformation somewhatsimilar to Vera Lambton 's , except that whereas the latter had descendedfrom the role of Salisbury elite , Julie had climbed the ladder from Dorset illiterate to solid gentlewoman , wife of a former major in the Fiftyninth . She found no difficulty in accepting Emma Saltwood as her sister-inlaw , partly because everyone knew that Emma would be returning to the Karroo as soon as the convening ended , and could thus pose no problem with her miscegenation , but partly also because of Christian charity . Julie saw that Emma was a remarkable woman and no doubt a fine mother , and as such she merited acceptance . The trouble came with Dr. Keer , for when he dismounted , tired and hungry after the long ride from Golan , he gasped when he saw Hilary , and thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and look at him ! To reach Keer 's hand , Hilary had to stoop , which made him appear even older and more haggard than he was ; in missionary work a man on the frontier aged much more rapidly than an official back in London . And when Keer realized that the little black woman trailing behind must be the Kaffir his informants had spoken of , he almost gagged : It 's another case of a man 's taking his missionary work too personally . In private discussions with the people of Grahamstown he spoke with some force against the awful error of a missionary 's marrying a woman of any tribe with which he worked : It 's a fatal mistake , really . Look at poor Saltwood . How can he ever return to England ? I need an assistant . Work does pile up . Parliament and all that , you know . But could I ask him to help me ? With a wife like that , how could he solicit funds from important families ? ' One night , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear boy , how did you ever allow this to happen to your brother ? ' and Richard replied with amusement , I think you 'd better ask Mrs. Carleton over there . You and she were responsible , you know . ' Me ? Carleton ? Never met the man . What 's he do ? ' He builds wagons . It 's his wife you know . ' Ca n't believe it , ' Keer said , but when he was led across the room to where Vera stood , she reminded him that they had met in Salisbury when she was still Miss Lambton . Of course , of course ! When I was giving my lecture on slavery . ' He coughed modestly . I visit the entire country , you know . Becomes very tiring . ' He was rambling on so that he might have time to collect his thoughts , and suddenly he remembered : But you were to marry Hilary Saltwood ! ' He stopped , then added in a pejorative way , But I hear you 've married the carpenter . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's balloon , and with the quiet assurance she had gained from doing hard manual work to aid her husband , she said , Yes , I did marry the carpenter . Because after your lecture that night I took you aside and asked for your personal opinion , and you confided that Hilary Saltwood was rather a silly ass . Which I confirmed later , so I thank you for your good advice . ' Dr. Keer was nonplused at the direction this conversation was going ,  |p361but  Vera forged ahead , her voice rising : So on the ship coming out I decided not to marry Hilary . I sought out Thomas Carleton , the wagon builder , I asked him to sleep with me , and then to marry me . So I am doubly indebted to you , Doctor . ' When Keer retreated several steps , she followed him . And I am indebtedin a third way . For when I see what a great fool you are , and what a man of nobility Hilary Saltwood is by comparison , I realize that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , or , for that matter , mine . Now you scamper back to London before the Boers hang you . ' She was still fuming when she reached home : It was awful , Thomas , that little prig . I suppose you 'll have to apologize tomorrow , but Hilary really is Christ-like , and Keer 's so stupid he would n't recognize Jesus if that carpenter walked in here tonight . ' Then she laughed . Did n't you see the way Keer patronized you ? And me ? He seems to forget that a carpenter was once important in this world , and may be so again . ' Angered by Keer 's open abuse of one of his missionaries , Vera was inspired to move closer to Emma Saltwood , and when the two had tea together , or when they walked with Julie Saltwood , there developed a kind of frontier solidarity which was possible among these pioneer women who had come long distances to a strange land and who had conquered it in limited ways . No one of the three had escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera battling the physical and emotional storms south of the Cape , wild Julie riding a horse to Plymouth to escape stupid parents and more stupid brothers  --  and each had won through to the reassuring plateau of strong husband and lively children . Common experience allowed them to be friends , but this could happen only in their generation . Already forces were at work which would drive them forever apart , and in the second generation companionship like this would be unthinkable . Then a woman of good heritage from a cathedral town would not care to associate with a runaway illiterate from Dorset , and neither would dare invite into her home a Kaffir , whether married to a white missionary or not . The cruel wedge that would separate people was driven deeper by everything that Dr. Keer did or said during his convention . In public meetings he excoriated the Boers , making any future relationship between Boer and missionary impossible . In private he continued to ridicule Saltwoodfor having taken a Kaffir wife ; on this subject he did make one important observation : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weapon in the hands of our adversaries . Critics accuse us of being **27;6857;TOOLONG , the Boers call us  --  and when one of our own people makes such a disastrous marriage , it proves that everything they said against us is true . It sets missionary work back fifty years . ' In general , he spoke and acted as if the welfare of the world depended upon his conciliating the better families of England so that they would bring pressure on Parliament to pass the laws he wanted . His damage to the Hilary Saltwoods was mortal . As head of the LMS , he dictated that Hilary was to be kept in seclusion on the farthest veld , and at the final reception , when it seemed that he had done as much damage as an intruder could , he delivered his ultimate insult . He was standing in a reception line , bestowing grace upon the locals ,  |p362when  the wagon builder Carleton and his sharp-tongued wife approached . Since apologies had been made , he was able to nod austerely , as he would to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had lacked the common sense to leave his Kaffir wife at home . She trailed along behind him , and when she reached Dr. Keer she held out her hand , intending to bid him safe journey home , but he found an excuse to turn away so that he would not have to acknowledge her . She kept her hand extended for just a moment , then  --  without showing any disappointment  --  dropped it , smiled , and passed on . The wagons that arrived to carry Dr. Keer back to the Cape brought a parcel of mail from London , including a letter from Sir Peter Saltwood , M.P. , Old Sarum , advising Richard that their mother was failing . Sir Peter was providing passage which would enable Richard to sail immediately , and it was hoped that he would bring his wife , whom the Salisbury Saltwoods were eager to meet . This was quite impossible , for after a shaky start , the Richard Saltwoods had now developed a good business in trading ivory , and it was imperative that he journey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Kaffirs , but it occurred to him and Julie that since the Hilary Saltwoods were in town , they should go . Much argument was advanced , with Emma pleading that she must return to her children , but as Hilary said , Those children love to stay in the veld . ' So a messenger was posted north with news that the Saltwoods were extending their absence for a year or two . In their innocence , they supposed it to be what essentially it was , the visit of a son to his aging mother , the presentation of a wife at the ancestral home . Just as Emma had been untouched by Reverend Keer 's refusal to take her hand , so she and Hilary would be unmoved by either acceptance or non-acceptance . And it never occurred to them that in places like Cape Town , London and Salisbury they would encounter open hostility . Raised eyebrows , yes . Amused chatter , yes . Even the repugnance which the Boer farmer felt toward an Englishman who had taken a Kaffir wife , they expectedsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiably together that they felt certain there could be no cruel surprises . They were wrong . Even while their wagon traveled slowly westward toward the Cape , curious people clustered to see the long-legged missionary who had taken the short Kaffir wife , and there were many giggles . At some houses where transients customarily slept , they were not welcomed , and occasionally they encountered real difficulty in finding quarters . At Swellendamthey were a surprise ; at Stellenbosch , a scandal . When they were safely across the flats and entering Cape Town , they assumed that there they would escape the unkind curiosity , but again they were mistaken . Dr. Keer had spoken rather harshly of his stupid outcasts in the Karroo , and many people went out of their way to see them , not as missionaries , but as freaks . They spent a trying time before their ship arrived , but once aboard it , their real troubles began . Four families of some distinction , returning home from India , refused to be seated in the same salon as the blackamoor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were not welcomed on deck , nor were they included in any of the ship 's activities . On Sundays church services were held without the participation of a clergyman , since none but Hilary was aboard , and he was not invited to preach , for his presence would be offensive to the better families . The ostracism worried him not at all . As he told his wife , We 're in an age of change , and it 's going to take time . ' That it would require two hundred years or more would have stunned him , for he moved about the ship unconcerned with the present , assured that the future would see a better balance between the races . With anyone who would speak with him , he talked quietly of mission life , explained the various regions of South Africa , and shared his vision of the future : In India you 'll have every problem we have . How can a few white Englishmen continue to govern huge numbers of people who are n't ? In a hundred years situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the same happening in Java with the Dutch , or in Brazil with the Portuguese . In New Zealand and Australia , I 'm told , the problem is somewhat different , because there the white man forms the majority , but he 's still got to rule decently or he 'll lose out . Like it or not , we must devise systems of government to meet unforeseenconditions , and I for one am convinced it must be done on a basis of Christ 's brotherhood . ' He was so persuasive in his quiet way that toward the end of the voyage certain passengers approached the captain and said that they would like to recommend Reverend Saltwood as minister for one of the last Sundays , but this was dismissed abruptly : Passengers would n't hear of it . ' To which the men replied , We 're passengers , and we think the others would accept . ' The appeal was denied . However , little Emma had been active among the children , telling them outrageous accounts of lions and leopards , of hippos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what interested the children most was her depiction of the Karroo : Think of a land as flat as this deck . Here , here and here , what do we have ? Little hills , round at the bottom , flat on top , never touching . Scores of them . And from these hills one morning comes a blesbok . You want to see what a blesbok looks like ? Here she took some blacking and transformed a boy 's face into the white-and-black glory of the blesbok . So here comes our blesbok . And then another . And another . You 're all blesboks , so get in line . And then another and another , until the world is full of blesboks . Marching in line . As far as you can see , faces like this . That 's where I live . ' When Blesbok number one returned to his parents , they wanted to know what in the world had happened to him , and he said , I 'm a blesbok , on the Great Karroo . ' This started inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining their children for some time , andp364when they discussed this with their boys and girls , they found further that she had become something of an idol : She can sing , and make games with string , and she tells us about ostriches and meerkats . ' So now certain women joined their husbands in an appeal to the captain , but he was adamant against allowing Saltwood to conduct services , on the very good grounds that whereas a few families may have come to accept the missionary , those that really counted were still set against it ; he knew from past experience that to irritate the rabble signified nothing , but to infringe in the slightest upon the prejudices of the ruling families meant that letters would be written to management and black marks cast . He 'd have none of that on his ship . On the second to last Sunday those families who still wanted to hear Reverend Saltwood preach arranged an alfresco worship on the afterdeck , and to it came most of the children , hoping to hear the missionary 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to sing . She did the latter . When her husband called for one of the Church of England hymns , and there was no organ to set the tune , her voice rose in unwavering volume , a beautiful voice that seemed to fill that part of the ship . Then her husband spoke briefly of Christ 's mission in Africa . He raised no difficult points , ruffled no sensibilities , and when the service ended with another hymn , many of the families congratulated him on an excellent performance . We 're so glad you sailed with us , ' one man said at the exact moment when the captain , in something of a rage , demanded to know who had authorized the service on the afterdeck . It just happened , ' a junior officer said . Do n't let it happen again , ' the captain said . Several passengers had already protested that such a service was a mockery , since the real service was being held in the salon . At Salisbury there was confusion . Emily had expected her son Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly not for his black wife . Had she wanted them to come , she would have sent for them , but when they arrived she simply could not behave poorly . She was glad to see Hilary again , even though he did look older than she , and she was respectful of his choice of a wife . In the second week she confided to her friend Mrs. Lambton : Thank God , I behaved myself . That Emma 's a treasure . ' Can you stomach the blackness ? ' I 'm happy if my son 's happy . You must feel the same way about Vera , married to the wagon builder . Emma tells me your daughter is quite content , with two or was it three ?  --  lovely children . ' To tell you frankly , Emily , long ago , before you talked with me , I dreamed that about this time Vera would be coming back to Salisbury with Hilary  --  that he 'd be taking up his duties at the cathedral . . . ' Suddenly she burst into uncontrollable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Damn ! Damn ! How dreadfully wrong things happen . How can you stand having that blackamoor in your house ? ' Emily wanted to weep , too , not for the black woman in her house , butp365for her son David , lost God knows where in Indiana , for Richard with his illiterate stable girl , and most of all for Hilary , that sad , mixed-up man about whose head such ugly rumors flew . You know what they 're saying in London ? ' Mrs. Lambton said after her sniffles were brought under control . Dr. Keer himself said to a small gathering . . . Our Cousin Alice was there and heard him . He says that poor Hilary is an outcast , that he 's made a perfect ass of himself , with English and Dutch alike . ' I suppose it 's true , ' Emily said . But I wonder if it matters . In God 's eyes , I mean . The other day I received a letter from London . Someone who 'd been on the ship with Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ Himself walking among men and restating His principles . He said he thought I 'd like to know . ' At this Mrs. Lambton dissolved completely , and after a series of racking sobs , mumbled , I had so wanted them to marry . Vera could have saved your son , Emily . She 'd have made him strong and proper . He 'd have been dean over there , mark my words . He 'd have been dean . ' The rest of the letter , ' Emily continued , said that Hilary had been denied use of the proper chapel aboard ship . The salon , I think they call it . He had to preach in the open . I think Jesus often preached in the open . I do n't think even Vera could have gained permission for my son to preach inside . ' I think he was ordained to  --  ' Against her will she broke into fearful sobs : He was so gaunt . He looked so sickly . The house they lived in on the desert , it sounded like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his poor wife had to make all the decisions . With an unexpected thrust of her hand , she took hold of Mrs. Lambton'sarm and cried , Laura , why do these things happen ? I 'll never see Richard or David again in this life . You 'll never see Vera or the children . We sit here like two old spiders in a web , with the flies far , far away . Karroo ! Karroo ! Who gives a damn about Karroo ? Or Indiana , either ? Life is here , and we 've let it slip away . We have a cathedral , the loveliest in England , but the choristers have fled . I feel such grief for that poor black woman in my garden . Laura , I could die of grief . ' Things improved not at all when Sir Peter came down from Parliament , well aware of what an embarrassment Hilary 's visit was causing . Several London newspapers had run cartoons showing an elongated missionary accompanied by his fat dwarfish wife with bare breast and grass tutu , entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jests , and the ridicule was beginning to have wide effect . Lady Janice was both mortifiedand apprehensive , fearing that it would be hurtful to the good work her husband was trying to accomplish , and she came to Salisbury intending to take stern measures and insist that her brother-in-law and his wife leave immediately . But when Sir Peter saw his younger brother and was reminded of that emotional moment at Old Sarum when he had invited his brothers always to come back to Sentinels , he relaxed , and pleaded with his wife to do the same , so although he could not express any warmth over this reunion , he did extend courtesies . Even Lady Janice was reasonably decent to her black sister-in-law.  |p366In  long discussions on the benches under the oak trees , Sir Peter sought guidance from his brother as to how England ought to conduct itself in this new colony : You know , Hilary , that I 'm rather the leader in the House on these matters . Yes , government 's given me free reign to work something out . Close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you create such a different impression from what Simon Keer 's been telling me that I wonder if we should n't call him down here for some serious consultation . ' That would be capital , ' Hilary said , not the least vengeful over Keer 's treatment of him at Grahamstown . So the fiery leader of the Africa philanthropistswas sent for , and in the meantime Emma Saltwood was exploring Salisbury . Each morning she helped serve breakfast , then donned a little white cap , took an umbrella , more as a stick for walking than for rain , and crossed over the Roman bridge into the village , where she spoke softly with anyone who wished to ask her about Africa and nodded deferentially to those who did not . She frequented all the shops , marveling at their intricacies , purchasing one small gift after another for her children . Her reception was uneven . Women of good family who enthusiastically supported Dr. Keer 's philanthropic movement loved the blacks in Africa , which they proved by their generous contributions , but were uneasy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ askance when Emma passed their way . It was the clerks in the shops and the housewives marketing who came to regard the missionary 's wife as one of themselves , greeting her warmly when they met . They began to talk with her about lions and mealies and meerkats and the tanning of hides . But mostly they marveled at her clear voice when she sang at services , and one man who knew music said , I can not believe so much voice can emit from such a small frame . ' He asked if she would sing for him in his study , and there , with the assistance of two pupils , he tested the range and power of her voice . She liked the experiment , took deep breaths , and sang a chain of wonderful notes . Now cartoons appeared entitled The Hottentot Nightingale , ' and she was asked to sing at various affairs and even to travel to Winchester to sing in the cathedral there . Always she maintained her smile , her willingness to work and talk with others . England at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange peoples they contained , and many persons like Emma had been imported to serve as nine-day wonders , but only a few reached the provinces . In Wiltshire , Emma Saltwood was a sensation . Therefore , when Dr. Keer arrived in town he could no longer ignore the little Hottentot , as everyone called her . Remembering that she was Sir Peter 's sister-in-law , he had to treat her decently , and insofar as he could unbend to an inferior , he did . Hilary , who could bear no animosity toward anyone , was actually pleased to see the dynamic little agitator , although , as he told Emma , He does n't seem so little now . Success and moving with important people have made him taller . ' It 's a game with him , ' Emma said shrewdly . The pieces on the board are no longer plain checkers . Now they 're knights and parliaments . ' But do n't forget . It was this man who taught me to love Jesus , ' Hilary said.  |p367'Do  n't you forget ! ' Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thunder and lightning . ' They speculated on what could have caused the profound change , and reached no conclusion , but when the three men sat beside the River Avon , admiring the swans that moved through the rippled reflections of the cathedral , Hilary was willing to concede that Keer was motivated by one ambition : to end slavery . Everything else was secondary ; he had moved from the veld onto a world stage : The pressing task no longer concerns the Cape Colony . It focuses solely on Parliament . We must pass the anti-slavery measure . We must force the colonial secretary to issue the ordinances I 've drafted . We must press forward , always forward . ' It was obvious that he had little concern with Boers , Kaffirs or Englishmen as human beings , but only with a rationalized system , and confessed this : In the government of nations the time often comes when the establishment of a principle ensures freedom for centuries to come . We 're at such a marking point . ' You do n't agree ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Dr. Keer 's right . We are at a turning point . But I believe it involves specific human beings and not abstract principles . Peter , in whatever you do , you must ask how this will affect the Boer farmer , for he is white South Africa . And how it will affect the Xhosa  --  ' You mean the Kaffirs ? ' I never use that word . They 're individual tribesmen . The Xhosa , the Pondo , the Tembu , the Fingo , the Zizi . And one day they 'll be Africa . So be careful what you do to them . And finally you ought to ask yourself , " How will this affect the Englishman ? " Because I assume we 'll govern the place for generations to come , and we must do so with justice . ' Ca n't we protect both Dr. Keer 's general interest and your specific ones ? ' I 'm afraid not . I think that when governments regulate in general , they stifle the individual , and then he festers and grows revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll guide the general . ' Quite wrong , ' Keer said with some force . Unless the principles are laid down , nothing good can follow . ' Sir Peter addressed his brother : How about the abolition of slavery ? Surely Dr. Keer is right on that . ' Indeed , indeed , ' Hilary said , twisting his long , thin legs in knots as he tried unsuccessfully to make his point . What I mean is , the abolition must be done without infuriating the white . Otherwise we 've accomplished noth-ing . ' With a stroke of the pen we accomplish everything , ' Keer said , his voice assuming the messianic glory he adopted when addressing church groups . Hilary , twisting his legs into even tighter knots , began to laugh . Peter , you 've never known a Boer , and , Simon , you 've forgotten . Let me tell you about my neighbor Tjaart van Doorn . Built square like a corncrib . No neck . Big whiskers down the side of his face . Wears a belt and suspenders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres and lives in a fort . How many slaves ? Half a dozen ? '  |p368What  's your point ? ' South Africa is filled with Tjaart van Doorns , and one day his white ox runs away . He goes after it , brings it back , and puts it to work . No punishment . No swearing . Two days later the ox runs off again . Again Tjaart goes after him . Same thing . I was there , baptizing a baby , and I saw him . Not a harsh word . So next day the white ox runs away a third time , and this time I go with Tjaart to help surround the beast , and when I get a rope around its neck , Tjaart comes up , blue in the face , and with a mighty roar he hits the ox between the eyes with a huge club . The ox drops dead , and Tjaart says to the fallen body , " By damn ! That 'll teach you . " ' The two listeners said nothing , and before either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Emily Saltwood had made : cold cider with honey and a dusting of cinnamon . Point I 'm making , Peter , is that if the laws you pass goad the Boers , they 'll listen once and accept what they do n't like , and they 'll listen twice . But I assure you , if you come at them a third time , they 'll grab that club and bash you between the eyes . ' Very carefully Simon Keer delivered his next observation : What it comes down to  --  it appears to me  --  are we ruling South Africa , or are the Boers , from whom we took the colony some years ago and whom we have cosseted outrageously ? ' With equal calm Hilary said , We did not take it from them . We took it from their supine government in Europe . They 're still there , every one of them , and increasing by the year . ' Then he became urgent : But more important are the Xhosa , the Pondo , the Tembu and the Fingo . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're also increasing , and we must act to keep everyone on balance . ' Can this be done ? ' Sir Peter asked , and before there could be a reply to a question that permitted no reply , Emma came rushing across the lawn , and when she reached the oak trees she gasped , Hilary ! It 's Mrs. Saltwood . I think she 's dead . ' In the aftermath of the funeral Mrs. Lambton said , in the presence of the two Saltwood boys and their wives , Hilary , get back to Africa . You should be forever ashamed of yourself . You killed your mother . ' Now wait ! ' Sir Peter said . She sat with me day after day , weeping . Once she broke into wild laughter and said , " The fault 's all mine . I bought that black girl for him . Yes , I sent him the money and he bought himself a wife . " ' Now , Mrs. Lambton , ' Sir Peter interrupted , but she had scorn for him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'd have thrown this pair out  --  ' Mrs. Lambton , just last week my mother told me that it was God 's providence that sent Hilary home , and not Richard . We did n't want Hilary to come . We were embarrassed when he did . But as we lived with him  --  and these were my mother 's words ..  |p369He  broke down . All he could do was grasp his wife 's hand and nod to her , indicating that she must continue . Lady Janice said , There was a reconciliation . Among all of us . ' She reached for Emma 's hand , welcoming her at last to Sentinels . But at the door Mrs. Lambton cried , You killed your mother . Go back . Go back . ' It could never be determined who murdered the two missionaries . Before dawn one morning in 1828 , when Hilary was only forty-three but looked sixty , distant herders saw fire at the hut , and when they reached it they found the two Saltwoods with their throats cut and all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering clues proved impossible . Speculation centered on six groups of suspects : Bushmen who liked to creep into such settlements and steal cattle , but none of the mission cattle were gone ; Hottentots who rebelled against authority , but the local Hottentots loved the Saltwoods , who had no servants ; Kaffirs who were quick with their assegais , but the Kaffirs in the area were mission hands who knew only peace ; Boers who despised most missionaries , but the only Boers in the area lived sixty miles away and they rather liked Saltwood ; Englishmen who hated the Saltwoods for besmirching the good reputation of the LMS through their miscegenation , but there were none in the area ; and wanderingSinghalese thieves off some ship , but the nearest harbor was seven hundred miles away . Perhaps society in the abstract had finished with them . They had fallen victims to that terrible affliction which brings certain crucifixion : they took religion too seriously ; they trusted Jesus Christ ; they believed that the bright , soaring promises of the New Testament could be used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one part of the world where they would cause offense to three powerful groups of people : the old Boers , the new English , the timeless blacks . In one of his most perceptive sermons Hilary had told his mission : The perpetual problem of government remains , " Am I safe at night when I go to sleep ? " ' Like many others asleep in South Africa , he had not been safe . It was an act of God , many alleged , that the three Saltwood children were absent when assassins struck . They were trekking in the Great Karroo with a Hottentot family , gathering ostrich plumes for sale in Paris . When they returned , their parents were already buried , and there was heated discussion as to what should happen to them . Some said they should be freighted down to Grahamstown on the next wagon heading south , but word was received that they were not wanted there . So there was some talk of sending them along to LMS headquarters in Cape Town , but they already had a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite improper to ship them off to England , where their ancestry would damn them . Put simply , there was no place for them . No one felt any responsibility for the offspring of what from the start had been a disastrous marriage . So the children were left with the Hottentots with whom they had hunted ostrich plumes.  |p370For  a few years they would be special , for the older ones could read and write , but as time passed and the necessity for marriage arrived , they would slide imperceptibly into that amorphous , undigestible mass of people called Coloured.  |p371THE  boy Nxumalo , like his distant ancestor , the Nxumalo who left the lake for Great Zimbabwe , had been reared to believe that what his chief said was law , no matter how contradictory or arbitrary . If the chief speaks , you leap ! ' his father told him , and the boy extended this sensible rule to all who gave orders . He was born to obey and trained to do so instantly . One bright , sunny day in 1799 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be an especially bitter lesson , since it came about because his father , an energetic man who loved the bursting flowers of spring , felt such a surge of joy that he could not keep from whistling whenever he walked through the fields near the kraal . The sound of Ndela 's happiness reached the ears of a suspicious woman who had concealed herself next to the footpath . A gnarled hunchback , she was the most powerful diviner in the region , a woman who held in her hands the balance of good and evil , of life and death . Now satisfaction spread across her face , for the spirits who lived in darkness had finally given her a sign . Ndela whistled ! ' she cackled to herself . Ndela whistled ! ' At last she knew why sickness lay like a cloak of winter mist over the herds of the Sixolobo . She was ready to act . That afternoon the entire Sixolobo clan was summoned to the chief 's place and the exciting word was passed : The diviner is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ndela arrived with no reason to suspect that he might be connected with the sick animals , but even so , when the divination began he behaved with his usual circumspection , because there was always the possiblity that it was in his body that the evil forces hid without his knowing it . A divination was a fearful experience . The old woman 's body was smeared with a loathsome mixture of animal fats ; her arms and parts of her face were streaked with a whitish clay ; her hair was rubbed with redp372powder ; and about her neck hung strings of roots and bones . Animal bladders dangled from her waist and in her hand she carried a weapon of dreadful power : a switch of wildebeest tail . About her shoulders , obscuring her hump , was draped a cloak of black material , while . strips of animal skin were fastened to various parts of her body . I bring words , my people , ' she intoned in solemn accents . I have dreamed these many nights and I have seen the evil that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord-of-the-Sky has made all things known . ' She began to dance , her bare feet slapping the earth , and when her pace had increased to leaps and bounds , the onlookers sang to give her encouragement , for they knew that she was reaching out for the spirits of the clan 's ancestors . There was not one in the audience who doubted a life after death ; they were also convinced that spirits who had gained more than the normal wisdom of the earth guided the destinies of the clan through the being of the diviner . Words that fell from her mouth were not hers , but the wishes and judgments of their forebears ; they must be obeyed . Suddenly she stopped dancing to take from a gourd at her side a pinch of snuff . When this caused a paroxysm of sneezing , the onlookers applauded , for they knew that spirits of the dead dwelt deep within the body of the living , and any tempestuous sneeze released their powers . Now came a hysterical screech of laughter , following which the diviner slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the cloak from her shoulders and placed it over her knees so that it cast a shadow before her . Opening a skin bag , she exhaled into it a pungent odor of the herbs she had been chewing and then removed from it the charms which would encourage the spirits to identify the contaminating wizard . For each item she laid before her she chanted words of praise : Oh , Claw of Great Leopardslayer of the weak .. . In my hand , Little Rock , trembler of the stream of sorrow .. . Fly to me , Talon of Hawk , watcher of all from above .. . Hear my voice , Flower of Night , keeper of eternal darkness .. With a flourish she threw the items on the ground in front of her , swaying above them . Keeping her head downcast for a long time , she muttered and moaned , then pointed with her left forefinger at one grisly treasure and another . All were silent , for the terrible moment was at hand . Finally she rose and walked boldly toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was about to accuse him . They have given me the answer , my Chief ! ' What did they show ? ' A great black beast with a hundred legs and a hundred eyes and the mightiest of horns . And it was revered by my chief , for it was the fattest animal in the land , because in it dwelt all those that had gone before . But this great beast was grieved . At a time when your cattle are ailing , one of those men out there '  --  and here she pointed generally at the silent crowd  --  ' one of them , at this time of sorrow , did not lament . One of them was happy that the animals are sick . ' Who was that one , **36;6886;TOOLONG ? ' The one who sings like a bird has brought this evil . ' When the diviner had said these fatal words , Nxumalo remembered immediately that his father sometimes sang like a bird ' with his whistling , and he had a terrifying premonition that Ndela might be the man carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched with horror as the diviner began to stalk among the people , her wildebeest switch dangling loosely at her side . Whenever her eyes met those of another , the one under scrutiny would shake with fear , then breathe again as she passed on . But when she reached Ndela , the whistler , she leaped high in the air , screaming and gesticulating , and when she came down , the switch was pointing directly at him . Him ! ' she shrieked . The happy one ! The ravager of cattle ! ' A cry rose from the crowd , and those nearest Ndela moved away . The great hump beneath the animal skins on the diviner 's back was accented as she twisted about to address the chief : Here is the wizard , the one who has brought the evil . ' Briefly the chief consulted with his councillors , and when they nodded , four warriors seized Ndela and dragged him forward . Did you whistle ? ' the chief asked . I did . ' While my cattle were dying ? ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ? ' I must have had it . ' It was impossible for Ndela to doubt that he was guilty , for if the spirits of the clan had advised the diviner that he was the guilty one , it must be so . Why did you do it , knowing it was wrong ? ' So many flowers . The birds were singing . ' So you sang too , while my cattle were dying ? ' Ndela had no explanation , so the chief growled , Is n't that true ? ' Yes , my Chief . ' Then let there be judgment . ' As he turned to consult his councillors , the men of the kraals moved closer while the women and children drew back . Ndela , ' intoned the chief , the ones who came before have pointed to you as the wizard . ' Praise them ! ' cried the crowd , paying deference to the spirits that guarded this clan . What shall be done with him ? ' Death to the wizard ! ' cried the men , the women ululating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the lips that whistled , whistle no more . Let the tongue that pushed air , push no more . Let the ears that heard birds , hear no more . Let the eyes that were made drunk by the flowers , see no more . Let the wizard die . ' As soon as the words were out , the four warriors grabbed Ndela and rushed him toward the stout poles encircling the kraal , where the cattle languished . The screaming victim was hoisted up , his legs pulled apart , andp374with one downward thrust , impaled so that the sharp pole entered deep into his body . Nxumalo , watching this without uttering a sound , wanted to run to the hideous scarecrow figure to mumble a farewell to his singing , loving father who had been so good to him , but any show of sympathy for a wizard was forbidden . Later , the corpse , the pole and even the ground at its base would be burned , and the ashes thrown into the swiftest river so that nothing might remain . Nxumalo could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they had merely carried out the customs of the clan . No one in the audience that day could have questioned the fairness of the judgment : the spirits had advised the diviner ; she had exposed the guilty man ; and he had been executed in the traditional manner . Hundreds of intricate rules governed a Sixolobo from birth till death , and beyond . Unquestionably the spirits of past members of the clan existed ; unquestionably there was a Lord-of-the-Sky who had placed all men on earth . No phase of life could be without regulation : a man 's hut must bear a certain relation to the chief 's ; women must move only in certain areas ; a child must watch carefully his attitude toward elders ; a man must observe formalities when approaching a stranger 's kraal ; and the treatment of cattle was minutely supervised . For any infringement of any of the rules , there was instant punishment , and death was obligatory for some fifty or sixty offenses , about the same number as applied in Europe at this time . Deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiatedgood and evil ; these were notions which had come down from his earliest ancestors in Africa , observed by the Nxumalo of Great Zimbabwe , and brought by his descendants southward . These rules could be as petty as where cooking utensils were to be placed at night , or as grave as an accusation of wizardry , for which death by impaling was prescribed . Nxumalo conceded that his father had been possessed by an evil spirit ; he understood how Ndela could confess to a crime of which he had no knowledge ; and he fully agreed that his father must die . He had observed that the chief never killed for sport , or whimsically , nor did he exact cruel punishment or torture ; he did only what tradition dictated must be done . He was a good man , burdened with duties and responsible for the lives of his thousand followers . There existed , in this paradise tucked in between the mountains and the sea , some two hundred clans , many smaller than the Sixolobo , some larger , and the chief had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller clans , obsequious to those with more cattle , and most careful with any group that might raid the Sixolobo . Whatever decisions he made must be for the security of the clan , and chiefs before him had learned that even the slightest infringement of law had best be dealt with immediately . The diviner was subsidiary to the chief , but as the earthly communicant with spirits , she wielded immense power and at moments of crisis might even overrule the chief . But the majority of her days were spent treating cuts and bruises , or relieving headaches , or brewing concoctions to ensure the birth of a son . But if a wizard crept into the tribe , spreading evil , she must seek him out , and then medicines were of no avail : that wizard must be impaled and burned.  |p375Nxumalo  understood all this and felt no bitterness , but since he was a bright lad he understood one thing more : that when a boy 's father had been executed , the boy lived under a shadow . It was quite probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not the slightest idea as to what it would be that he would do wrong , but experience warned him that the son of a man who had been impaled ran a strong chance of repeating that prolonged death . Caught in a conflict between obedience and self-preservation , he solved it in this manner : If I stay with the Sixolobo , I must do what the chief says , and I shall , but here the dark spirits are against me . So I shall run to a new tribe where I can start afresh , and give my allegiance to its king . He told no one of his decision , not even his mother , and before the moon showed midnight he was moving swiftly through the glorious valleys which led to the tribes of the south . To the west rose the forbidding peaks reaching eleven thousand feet into the sky , to the east swept the waters of the ocean . He did not know where he was running to , but he was certain that there would be a welcome for a sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he wanted his new home to be at a safe distance from the Sixolobo , because he knew that if they ever found him fighting against them , he would receive a much harsher punishment than his father had suffered . Traitors were punished with four bamboo skewers . He was headed for a river whose fame he had always known , the Umfolozi , which drained some of the most handsome land in Africa , tumblingout of the great mountains and running almost eastward to the sea . It marked a division between the tribes of the north and those to the south . It was not a massive river ; few of the rivers of southern Africa compared to the great waterways of Europe or America , but it brought richness to all who lived along it , for its fields yielded good crops and its banks were crowded with animals of all description . When moist and heavy winds blowing in from the south warned Nxumalo that he was approaching water , he concluded that he had come to the legendary Umfolozi , and he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were none , and for two nights he patrolled the land well back from the river ; on the third morning he came upon a group of nine boys his own age , naked like him and herding cattle . With trepidation , but also a determination to protect himself regardless of what the boys attempted , he warily picked his way among the rocks guarding the pasture where the cattle grazed , and from a fair distance , prepared to announce himself . But at this moment the herders launched into a cruel game of throwing one of their younger companions into the center of a circle , while they kept a tough round tuber the size of a ball away from him , tripping him as he lunged for them and kicking him when he fell . Little penis ! ' they screamed at him . Little penis ! Ca n't do anything ! ' The boy in the center was himself not little ; he was quite handsomely proportioned in all but his genitals , and probably able to handle any one of his eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him , shouting words that wounded , he could only stand them off in a kind of blind rage . His fury gave him added strength , and the incessant jibes about his penis drove him to extraordinary efforts ; at one point he leaped high in the air ,  |p376almost  intercepted the ball , and did succeed in driving it off course and over the fingertips of his enemies . He , seeing its flight , was able to break through the circle of bullies and leap for it before any of them could change direction . The ball rolled directly to Nxumalo 's feet , and when the abused lad reached it he found a stranger handing it to him . In this way Nxumalo , a voluntary outcast from the Sixolobo , met Shaka , an involuntary exile among the Langeni . With Nxumalo as his ally and ready to defend him , Shaka , a twelve-yearold , moody , difficult boy , received less tormenting . True , the entire Langeni clan continued to make fun of his undersized penis , and there was no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play was involved , the newcomer and the moody one formed a resilient companionship . Yet , strangely , they were not friends , for Shaka would admit no one to that privileged position . Yet he must have someone to talk with , and one night , his voice bursting with pride , he told Nxumalo , I 'm a Zulu . ' What 's that ? ' The tormented one could not mask his disgust at such ignorance : Zulu will be the most powerful tribe along the Umfolozi . ' In the north we have n't heard of them . ' Everyone will hear when I 'm chief . ' Chief ! What are you doing herding cattle in this small tribe ? ' I was cast out of the Zulu . I 'm son of their chief , and he banished me . ' Then , with a bitterness Nxumalo had never witnessed before , Shaka unfolded his account of the intrigue which had driven him from the tiny , inconsequential tribe of the Zulu : My mother Nandi  --  you 'll meet her one day . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I die she 's going to be proclaimedFemale Elephant . People will bow down to her . His voice trembled . She was the legal wife of the chief , and he rejectedher . . . cast us both out of his kraal , but I 'll go back , and take my mother with me . He clenched his fists . I 'm an outcast . You hear them make fun of me . Remember their names . Nzobo , he 's the worst . Mpepha , he 's afraid to hit me . He uses a club . Mqalane , remember him . I will always remember Mqalane . He named the other five , repeating some . They laugh at me . They refuse me permissions . But most of all , Nxumalo , they ridicule my mother . Here he began trembling furiously . I tell you , Nxumalo , one day she will be the Female Elephant . Silence , and then the real burden . No , the worst is n't that . It 's the way they make fun of me . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bow , to weep , but he did tremble , grinding his heel in the dust . They make fun of me . ' The simple sentence that Nxumalo uttered next would save his life on the day of retribution , but now it seemed only a gesture of decent friendship.  |p377He  reached out , touched Shaka on the arm , and said , Later it will grow bigger . ' Will it ? ' the older boy cried impetuously . I 've often seen it happen . ' He had no authority for what he was saying , but he knew it must be said . Shaka said nothing more , just sat there in the grass , pounding his fists against his knees . Like any confused boy his age , Shaka had shaded the truth , so far as he was able to understand it . Senzangakhona , chief of the Zulu clan , had impregnated Nandi , a virgin of the Langeni . When the elders of the latter tribe heard of this shocking breach of tribal custom , they insisted that Senzangakhona do the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , but she proved more disagreeable than sand in the mouth . Her son was worse , and at the age of six allowed one of his father 's favorite animals to be slain , a mistake which precipitated banishment . Shaka was no longer a Zulu ; he and his mother must take refuge in the kraals of the despised Langeni . On the day they left , Senzangakhona was most pleased ; they had given him nothing but trouble , and he recalled what his councillors had said that first day when Nandi claimed she was pregnant : She had no baby in her . It 's only the intestinal insect they call iShaka . ' The king agreed , and now watched with undisguised pleasure as his unwanted wife disappeared , takingher insect ' with her . In 1802 famine swept the valley of the Umfolozi , the only time that men could remember when the richest of rivers betrayed her children , but now the lack of food was so critical that the chief of the Langeni began to drive unwanted persons out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nandi , mother of Shaka , and her son , who was liked by no one in the clan . As they were departing southward , using a ford that crossed the river , the outcast boy Nxumalo overtook them , saying that it could not be long before he , too , would be forced out and asking permission to join them in their exile . Nandi , a powerful woman who wasted little effort in sentiment , said , Stay behind . ' But her son , remembering various behaviors of the younger boy , said , Let him come . ' And the exiles moved south . In time they straggled into the lands of Dingiswayo , most important of the southern chiefs , and when he saw the two stalwart fellows he wanted them for his regiment : You look like warriors . But can you fight ? ' Long-shafted assegais were produced , but when Shaka hefted his he disliked its balance and demanded a replacement . Why ? ' asked the chief , and brusquely Shaka said , A warrior must have confidence . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say , I 'm ready . ' Dingiswayo laughed at his impudence , saying to his attendants , He looks like a warrior . He boasts like one . Now we 'll see if he can fight . ' Hearing this implied insult , Shaka pointed to a distant tree : There is your enemy , Great Chief . ' And with a short run he launched his assegai far and true , so that Dingiswayo laughed no more . He fights like a warrior , too . ' To the young man he said , Welcome to my regiment . ' For the next years Shaka and Nxumalo shared a wild experience . As members of the region 's greatest regiment , the iziCwe , they helped fortifyp378their tribe 's position , participating in the vast raids that kept the territory pacified and augmented . Nxumalo was content with his good fortune in gaining a position , however menial , in the land 's finest fighting unit , but Shaka was as disconsolate and irritable as ever : There 's a better way to fight . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they made me commander for one month .. For example , in the great battle against the Mabuwane he was outraged , even though it was judged that he had been the foremost warrior . What happened was a standard battle , which , in Nxumalo 's opinion , the iziCwe regiment had dominated . Four hundred of Dingiswayo 's troops marched north in noisy stages , announcing at every stop that they were about to engage the Mabuwane . Two hundred women , children and old men trailed behind , throwing a cloud of dust that could be seen for seven miles . In the meantime , the Mabuwane , who had known for two weeks that a battle was to be fought , had been scouting not the enemy , whose dispositions they always knew , but for a suitable spot on which to fight . One of the major considerations was that on the Mabuwane side at least , and on both sides if at all possible , there be commodious hills from which the audience could watch , and a comfortableand level place on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flow of the battle . The Mabuwane did their job well , and an ideal battleground was selected , a kind of pleasant amphitheater with exactly the kind of sloping sides the spectators preferred . When the two armies lined up , there were dances , formations , shouted insults and a good deal of foot-stamping . Then from each side four men moved forward , brandishing their shields and shouting fresh insults . The mothers of the opposing warriors were excoriated , the condition of their cattle , the poor quality of their food , and their known history for cowardice . Each warrior carried three assegais , and at maximum distance each threw one that came so far in such good light that the big shields had ample time to deflect them . Unfortunately , one of the Mabuwane warriors shunted a spear aimed at him right onto the foot of one of his own men . It did n't pierce the foot , but it did bring blood , whereupon the multitude on Shaka 's side cheered wildly . Nxumalo was especially excited , dancing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm in a terrible grip . Stop that ! This is n't warfare . ' Then , from a distance almost as great as the first , a second flight of assegais was released , again with no consequences . At this point it was obligatory for the four warriors on each side to run forward and to throw their last spears from a distance of about twenty-five feet . Again they could be fended off easily . Now the main bodies of the two armies were required to mingle ; however , they did so under carefully understood rules : vast flights of assegais , thrown from far distances so they could be easily deflected , and when both armies were thus disarmed , a fragmentary melee without weapons in which one side pushed a little harder than the other and took a few captives . The observers could readily see which side had won , and when this was determinedthe other side fled , leaving its cattle to he captured and a few women to he taken home by the victors . Of course , in the scuffling some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be killed , but in general the casualties were minimal . A convenient feature of such a battle was that when it ended , each side could pick up about as many assegais as it had carried at the beginning , but of course they were not the same ones . Disgraceful ! Shaka brooded . This is no way to fight . Imagine ! And he kicked his right foot in the air , sending his cowhide sandal in a wide arc : Men fighting in sandals . It slows them down . They ca n't maneuver . And it was after this fight that he began running up and down hills barefooted , until his feet were tougher than sandals and his breath inexhaustible . He also required Nxumalo to stand in the sun hour after hour , holding a big shield in his left hand , an assegai in his right . Forty times , fifty Shaka told Nxumalo , I am your enemy . You must kill me . ' And with a wild leap Shaka sprang forward , bringing the left edge of his shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assegai , as warriors were supposed to do , Shaka suddenly swept his own shield-edge brutally to the left , hooked Nxumalo 's shield and half-spun him around so that the entire left side of his body stood exposed . With one swift lunge , Shaka thrust his spear at Nxumalo 's heart , halting it inches from the skin . That 's the way to kill , ' he cried . In close . ' One afternoon , when he had slain Nxumalo many times , he took his own assegai and in a rage broke the shaft , kicking the halves in the dust . Spears are not the weapons for a fight . We need stabbers . ' And in fury he grabbed Nxumalo 's spear and shattered it , too . What 's the matter ? ' Nxumalo asked . So stupid ! ' Shaka cried , kicking at the spears . Two armies approach , like this . You throw your first spear . I throw mine . Second spear . Third spear . Then when we have no weapons we rush at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of the two spears , he went with Nxumalo to the best iron forger along the river and asked him whether he could combine these two points into one  --  a massive , heavy , blunt stabbing sword . The artisan said that might be possible , but where would Shaka find a haft heavy enough for such a spear . It 's no longer a spear , ' Shaka said . It 's something quite different . ' And he worked with all the blacksmiths , trying to find the man who could make the terrible weapon he visualized . In these days , when the two were still living in mutual exile , Nxumalo noticed several unusual aspects of his friend 's behavior , and once when they talked idly of their possible futures in this alien chiefdom , where warriors were respected but where real warfare was unknown , Nxumalo was goaded into telling Shaka of those obvious curiosities . For one thing , you cleanse yourself more than anyone I 've ever known . Always under the bowl of thrown water . ' I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked before the others . To show them that your penis is now big , like theirs . ' Shaka frowned , but said nothing . And with girls , you 're not like the rest of us . You often avoid the pleasures of t he road . ' This was a lovely euphemism for one of the most gracious of the localp380customs . Since among these clans premarital intercourse was severely forbidden , the habit had evolved of taking the pleasures of the road , ' meaning that youngsters were permitted to reach out for a likely love and take her into the bushes for any imaginable kind of frolic so long as pregnancy did not result . The men in the iziCwe were notorious for their gentle debauches , and none enjoyed them more than Nxumalo , but he had noticed that Shaka was indifferent to this love-play . ' No , ' Shaka said reflectively on this particular day , ' I am destined to be a king . And it 's perilous for a king to have children . They fight for his throne . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mid-twenties when he said this , and so far as Nxumalo could remember  --  and he knew this moody warrior better than anyone else  --  Shaka had never once boasted of his sexual exploits as other young men did . Nxumalo suspected that his friend had never lain with a woman , even though he was six foot three , with no fat about his middle , and the target of many eyes . When it 's time to marry , ' Nxumalo predicted , ' watch out ! You 'll be the first . ' ' No , ' Shaka said quietly . ' For me no children . ' ' We 'll see , ' Nxumalo said , whereupon Shaka gripped him by the shoulder : ' You say I lie ? ' ' Oh , no , ' Nxumalo replied , brushing his hand away . ' But you love women more than any man I 've ever known . Your mother . ' In a rage so violent that the grass trembled , Shaka leaped up , sought madly for a stone , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away like a frightened snake . ' Shaka ! ' he cried from behind a tree . ' Put that down ! ' For several moments the warrior stood there , gripping the stone till his dark hands showed pale at the knuckles . As the routine of army life absorbed them , disclosing no alternatives for the years that loomed , Nxumalo saw with some anxiety that his friend was becoming almost suicidal , dreaming hopelessly of goals he could never attain , and he felt that he must help him assuage this corrosive bitterness : ' When you said , " One day I 'll be chief "  --  of what ? There 's no chance here . There 's no chance of returning to the Langeni . ' ' Oh ! Wait ! ' Shaka said with fiery determination . ' One day I will return to the Langeni . There are men there I want to see again . ' And he began to recite the names of the boys who had tormented him in the pastures : ' Nzobo , Mpepha , Mqalane . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Chief of them ? ' He laughed , and began to stride back and forth . ' I want to be king of a real tribe . And with my men to march upon the Langeni . And ask them about their laughter . ' Suddenly he changed completely and asked Nxumalo , ' Would n't you like to go back and be chief of the Sixolobo ? ' ' I do n't even remember them . ' ' Do n't you want to meet the men who killed your father ? ' ' I would n't know them . My father broke a rule . He was executed . ' ' But if we could take the iziCwe and march into Langeni land one year , then Sixolobo the next . . . ' His big hands had their fingers extended andp381slowly he brought them together . There 's only one clan I want to lead , ' Shaka said . The Zulu . ' Nxumalo grew grave : You must forget the Zulu . They banished you . Your father has n't seen you in years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a tiny flea compared to this clan ? ' But if I were King of the Zulu . . . ' He hesitated , reluctant to share his aspirations . Lamely he concluded : The Zulu are real men . By the end of the first day they 'd understand my dreams . ' In 1815 he revealed his vision of what warfare in his territory was to become . It was an engagement with the Butelezi , and everyone else supposedit was to be an ordinary confrontation , with the two chiefs seated in their chairs as thousands applauded the desultory skirmishing , but when the ground was selected and everyone was in place , a single Butelezi warrior stepped forward with mocking , insolent gestures . From Dingiswayo 's ranks a tall man , lean as lion sinew , dashed barefooted at the enemy , hooked his shield deftly into his opponent 's , twirled him about like a top , and plunged his short , terrible assegai into the heart . Then , with a wild yell , he bounded toward the front ranks of the Butelezi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm upon the amazed enemy and slay them . Fifty enemy dead . Kraals burned . Nearly a thousand cattle led home in triumph . More than a dozen women captured . There had never before been a battle like this , and there would never again be a battle in the old style . As a consequence of this stunning victory , Shaka gained Dingiswayo 's favorable attention and was promoted rapidly to regimental commander , a post of honor which he should have held in quiet distinction for the remainder of his life . But such limited achievement was not what Shaka had in mind , not at all . At night he whispered to Nxumalo , This Dingiswayo goes to battle as if it were a game . He returns cattle to the vanquished . Leaves them their women . ' In the darkness Nxumalo could hear him gritting his teeth . This is n't war . This is the quarreling of children . ' What would you do ? ' I will bring war to the world . Real war . ' In 1816 , when Reverend Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little Madagascan girl Emma the geography of Europe , Shaka 's father , chief of the Zulu , died , and after an obliging assassin had removed the son intended for the succession , Shaka at last seized command of the clan , one of the smallest , with a total population of only thirteen hundred and an army , if all the able-bodied were mustered , of three hundred , plus two hundred novices . It was a clan of little distinction , smaller than either the Sixolobo or the Langeni ; it had no special history , had expanded its lands not at all during the preceding hundred years , and had provided no regional leadership except Shaka 's promotion to command of the iziCwe . Normally the Zulu would have remained of these dimensions , crouched along one of the better reaches of the Umfolozi River . But when Shaka assumed command , he moved in with an iziCwe regimentto support his takeover , and one of the first things he did was top382require that every Zulu soldier throw away his three long-shafted assegais and replace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height and width of their shields , until a standing man , with knees only slightly bent , could hide his whole body behind two layers of rock-hard cowhide . But in some ways the most important thing he taught was how to dance . First he appointed a knobkerrie team of six , choosing the tallest , strongestand most brutal men from his new recruits . Brandishing their clubs , they would stand behind him at all future public functions , awaiting his instructions . Then he assembled his Zulu regiment at the edge of a flat piece of ground well covered with three-pronged thorns . When they stood at attentionin the moonlight he stepped before them , barefooted as always . My warriors , ' he said quietly . Four times I have told you that if you want to be the greatest regiment along the Umfolozi , you have got to fight barefooted . And four times you have returned to your sandals . Now take them off . Throw them in a pile . And never let me see them again . ' When the recruits stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low voice , Now , my warriors , we 're going to dance . ' And he led them onto the thorn-studded land and began a slow dance , accompanied by a chant they knew well . Sing , my warriors ! ' he cried , and as the rhythms began to throb , he danced upon the projections , which caused him no trouble , for he had made his feet tougher than leather . But for his soldiers those first tentative steps were agony , and some began to falter from a pain greater than they could bear . Now came Shaka 's first lesson to his Zulu . Watching hawklike , he spotted a man whose legs simply could not force his feet down onto the piercing thorns . That one ! ' Shaka cried , pointing at the soldier . What happened next became invariable . Two of the knobkerrie team grabbed the offender from behind , pinioning him with great force . Another dropped down and grasped his ankles , spreading his legs apart . Reaching around from in back , the burliest of the gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing of his arms , twisted it halfway around till the face was looking backward . Then an equally powerful man from in front grasped the chin and continued the awful wrenching until the man 's face was again looking forward , having made a complete circle . The face looked the same , but the man was forever altered . Now dance ! ' he cried , and twice more he detected soldiers who were less than enthusiastic , and when he designated them , the slayers descended upon them , twisting their heads about in full circles . Faster and faster Shaka set the beat until even he was tired . Then , with a gentleness that Nxumalo would never forget , he looked up at the moon and said , My dear warriors . It 's three nights till the moon is full . Now go and harden your feet , for at the full moon after this , we shall all dance again . You have thirty-one days . ' When they resumed , at the next full moon , only one soldier 's neck hadto be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end all were jumpingup and down on the thorns , driving them into the ground , and singing theirregimental songs , and shouting with joy as they danced with their chief . The next day Shaka explained to his troops why the foot-hardening hadbeen necessary : We shall have an army unlike any that has ever swept alongp383the Umfolozi . And its power will be speed . You and I will fly over the rocks , body-arms-head . ' That would be the secret of Shaka 's irresistible army of Zulu : The body is the big concentration at the center . This is all that the enemy is allowed to see . The arms are swift outreaching movements on the flanks . These are concealed from the enemy . ' And the head ? ' Nxumalo asked . You are the head , trusted friend . You 're now in charge of my best regiment , and during the first stages of a battle your men hide behind a hill , at the center . With your backs to the fighting . You sit with your faces away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know how the battle progresses . You must be neither excited nor dismayed . At the crucial moment I 'll tell you what to do , and without thinking or trying to adjust , you roar forth and do it . ' It was the kind of commission at which Nxumalo excelled , for it requiredonly allegiance and blind obedience , the two virtues that characterizedhim . Some men require a leader in whom they can place absolute trust ; in his shadow they grow strong . And Nxumalo was such a man . Convinced that Shaka was a genius , he found it rewarding to obey him , and in doing so , became the young chief 's only trusted advisor . One morning when the two stood before the regiments the difference between them was obvious . Both were dark of skin , both were battle-hardened . Shaka , only a year older , stood much taller than his aide , broader of shoulder and quicker of movement . In all ways he seemed superior , until the observer looked at Nxumalo 's stocky middle , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never tire , a belly that could stand punishment , very stout legs prepared to climb hills , and a general endurance that was unmatched . They formed a good pair : Shaka the mercurial planner , Nxumalo the stolid executor . Early in their strategy discussions they realized that if Shaka 's battles were to depend upon fluidity , swift communication among the various segments was vital ; equally important was accuracy . So one morning they assembled the four regiments that had been formed , and Shaka initiated this training exercise : Speed and accuracy . They 're to be the heart of our success . Now the vice-commanders of our regiments are to go one mile from here , each in a different direction , then stand and wait . Each regiment , nominate four signal-runners , place one here with me , the other three at intervals along the way . When you 're all in position , I 'll give the signalrunnershere a message . And off you go . Run to the first waiting man , give him the message , and he carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches the end of the line . Then you vice-commanders dash back here and tell me what the message was . Speed and accuracy . ' When the sixteen outlying men were in position , Shaka studied the field as if this were a real battle , and with Nxumalo and three other regimental commanders at his side , he said in a loud , clear voice , Run forty paces forward . Turn and go to the three trees . Leave half your men there . Move forward eighty paces . ' As soon as he had said this he clapped his hands , and the first signalrunnerswere off . With amazing speed these barefooted men , their feetp384inured to rocks and thorns , sped over the difficult terrain , ran up to the first waiting men , and delivered their messages . With some satisfaction , Nxumalo saw that his runners were doing rather better than the others , but this was to be expected , and when the final runners carried their messages to their waiting officers and those men began their dash back to Shaka , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running at breakneck speed , this man approached the chief , knelt and delivered the message exactly as it had been stated earlier , and so did the next two officers , but the fourth not only lagged in speed but also in the accuracy of his message ; indeed , it was badly garbled . Shaka showed no displeasure . Instead he waited for the sixteen signalrunnersto come gasping back to the center , whereupon he praised Nxumalo 's men , nodding graciously to him as he did so . The second and third teams he also praised , but when he came to the five delinquent men , he merely pointed at them , whereupon the knobkerrie team grabbed them one by one and burst open their skulls . Speed and accuracy , ' he said grimly , leaving the field . Shaka placed major reliance upon Nxumalo because of his unflinching obedience . Some commanders questioned orders , but never his old companion : If I told the iziCwe to swim a river , climb a mountain and fight five thousand enemy along the way , Nxumalo would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiments that he depended upon the iziCwe as his one certain arm in battle , for its performance was terrifying . Shaka 's vision of the campaigns that would make him king required total war , total obedience to his personal rule , total destruction of anyone who raised even a whisper against him . He saw Dingiswayo 's limited forays as a perpetuation of the petty rivalries which allowed every minor chief a separate development that made him weak and without direction . He was determined to sweep all clans into one great Zulu nation , and to do this his warriors must move like vast herds of antelope , leaving no blade of grass untouched . While Shaka drilled his regiments , his mother , Nandi , asserted herself in the Zulu kraals . She became indeed the Female Elephant , trampling on those who had rejoiced at her departure years before . The long years of exile which mother and son had shared had forged an extraordinary bond of love and understanding , and now Nandi pushed her son ever forward toward the mighty destiny she saw for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Shaka judged that his amaZulu were ready for the massive tasks ahead , he told his commanders one evening in 1816 , We move against the Langeni , ' and he was so determined to humble the clan which had treated his mother badly that he rehearsed his battle plan for three tiring days : Nxumalo , you were a dog of the Langeni . This time your regiment will form the body . I 'm giving you that position because I want total discipline . No Langeni man is to be killed unless absolutely necessary . The two flanks . You must move with greater speed than ever before and capture the enemy alive . ' Ominously , on the final evening he commissioned four additional bullies to serve in his knobkerrie team and gave one of them a club suitable for driving stakes . With all steps planned , he went to sleep.  |p385Shortly  after dawn Nxumalo assembled the four regiments in a hollowsquareformation , each in its distinctive uniform , with headdress of identifyingcolor and large shields of different-colored cowhide . When all was ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself stepped into the center of the square , a giant of a man , completely naked , conspicuously muscled , and at a signal from Nxumalo the waiting soldiers cried Bayete ' and gave foot-stomping applause . His three personal attendants now dressed him for battle . First they put on a loincloth apron of tanned leather , then a girdle of bright leopard skin about two inches wide fastened tightly to support an ashy gray kilt made of twisted genet fur which ended well above his knees . About his shoulders they placed a loose garland of animal tails kept so short they would not flop when he ran , and on his head a kind of crown formed by tufts of small red feathers and topped by a backward-curving blue-crane feather at least two feet long . He was barefooted , of course , and carried in his hands only two things : his massive shield almost as tall as himself and pure white , except for a small black dot in the middle ; and his stabbing assegai with haft two feet long and iron point one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the four adornments the attendants now attached . About each arm , just below the shoulder , an armband of white cowtails was tied , the tips reaching down to his elbows and very full , so that they fluttered when he moved . And below each knee , reaching to his ankles , a similar band was fastened , and it was these white ornamentations , combined with the stark whiteness of the shield , that caused his brown-black body to glow with imperial grandeur . We march ! ' he cried as he faced his regiments , and his five hundred warriors replied , ' Bayete ! ' Like a serpent the Zulu army snaked through the hills , and at dawn next morning the Langeni were surprised to find , upon waking , that enemy regiments surrounded their kraals . Shaka 's orders were obeyed , and the amazed Langeni , expecting their huts to be fired , their people slaughtered , found no assegai raised against them except in silent warning . Could this be Shaka , whose heralds referred to him as **32;6924;TOOLONG ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly among the huddled Langeni , nodding at one , then another , until he had identified more than thirty . These men were taken to the main kraal , where they looked up at a face that seemed strangely familiar . I am Shaka , son of the Female Elephant Nandi , whom you reviled . ' He sang out the names of the tribal leaders , and as each was shoved forward , the knobkerrie team began the slaughter . The execution squad worked in different ways . If a victim had ever displayed one redeeming virtue , his head was swiftly and almost painlessly twisted in a complete circle . Death was instantaneous . But if there were remembered grudges , without extenuating circumstances , clubs were used , a heavy rain of blows to all parts of the body except the head , and this death was painful . The older Langeni died in this manner . But when Shaka pointed out those who as herd boys had tormented him , he ordered the guards to stand them aside , and in the end he had eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew dark as a thundercloud and reason seemed to leave him , for he was a boy again , back in the fields ,  |p386and  when he saw his chief aide and most trusted friend , Nxumalo , he shouted , ' You , too , were one of them ! ' and the knobkerrie team seized him and threw him with the others . Nzobo , ' he now screamed at one of the former herd boys . Did you not scorn me ? ' The Langeni , now a man of substance , stood silent . Take him ! ' Shaka bellowed , and in that instant Nzobo was taken hold of and stripped . Then two men held him by the knees while another two bent him forward in a final , terrible bow , as if he were a suitor seeking Shaka 's approval . Another produced four bamboo skewers , each about fourteen inches long , firehardenedand needle-sharp . One of these was inserted into Nzobo 's rectum , and with a wooden pounder the last member of the knobkerrie team hammeredit home deeply , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth was hammered in , whereupona rope was slung under the armpits of the screaming victim and he was pulled aloft to hang from the limb of a tree . After sixteen hours of mortal agony he would be dead . Nxumalo , seeing this horrible punishment and aware that he was destinedfor it , tried to make some appeal to Shaka , but the awful judgment was proceeding : Mpepha , did you not throw rocks at me ? ' A list of grievances , kept alive for twenty years , was hurled at the terror-stricken man , who was then stripped and skewered . Mgalane was next , and when he , too , dangled from the tree , Shaka was finished with the three whose long-ago behavior rankled deepest . The next eight were impaled on the poles of the cattle kraal , where he could not see them . ' It 's repugnant to watch traitors die , ' he told his men , but now two were dragged forward whose death he would cherish . Did you abuse me ? ' The men nodded . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then he asked , Did you abuse my mother ? ' and when they stood , heads down , he screamed , Let them die as women ! ' whereupon the death squad fell upon them and tore away their privates . Now only Nxumalo remained , and at him Shaka looked with loathing , but also confusion . He had been one of the herd boys ; clearly Shaka rememberedthat , but he could not recall what exactly the Sixolobo refugee had done that merited skewering . The guards were already stripping him when the king 's mind cleared slightly and he realized that his regimental commanderought not to be included , and with humility he brushed the guards aside and stood facing Nxumalo . What did you do against me when we were herd boys ? ' And Nxumalo replied , Nothing , my Chief . ' ' What did you ever do for me ? ' And this time Nxumalo said , I can not speak it , Mighty One . But I will whisper it . ' So Shaka moved everyone back , ordering the guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked commander stood with his leather skirt in his hand , he whispered to the chief , reminding him of that afternoon when they sat upon the grass and Nxumalo had assured him that one day he would have a penis of normal size . Shaka put the fingertips of his left hand over his eyes and bowed his head . Are you Nxumalo of the iziCwe ? '  |p387I  am . Dark spirits are on this field , ' Shaka mumbled , and with a great stranglingcry he demanded that the diviners conduct a smelling-out to identify the men in this gathering who housed these spirits , and the wild ones with snake skeletons dangling about their necks , dried gall bladders in their hair and black wildebeest tails in their hands ran helter-skelter among the Zulu , sniffing and listening and finally touching with their switching tails those who had brought evil upon the chief . As soon as a victim was designated , the knobkerrie men killed him . Toward midnight , as Shaka sat drinking beer with Nxumalo , he began to feel pity for the impaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging through the night , ' he said , and he directed his people to gather huge mounds of grass and sticks to pile under the dangling men . See , ' he cried to his victims , I no longer hold bitterness against you . ' And he lit the grass so that the men might die quickly and escape the terrible agonies that would otherwise have come with the morning , when the hot sun began to shine upon them . As a gesture of conciliation Shaka absorbed the Langeni regiments into his growing army , launching a policy that would result in a powerful force . When Dingiswayo , to whom he still owed nominal allegiance , died in battle with a northern tribe , the entire iziCwe contingent marched over to the Zulu , and Shaka said , Nxumalo , my truest friend , from this day you eat with the iziCwe . ' This thrilling announcement had nothing to do with the manner in which the new general of the regiments would take his meals ; it referred to the terrifying battle cry that would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy : I have eaten ! ' In every direction Shaka lashed out with devastating speed , devouring small clans , and one morning he cried brusquely , Today we destroy the Ngwane , ' and within a few hours the regiments had crossed the Umfolozi River and were dashing north to the kraals of a tribe which had given repeated trouble . Without signals or warning , other than the cries of astonishedherd boys who saw the amazing army approaching , the Zulu took battle position , body-arms-head , and fell upon the community . The Ngwane , like all subsidiary tribes in this region , were stalwart men and they did not propose to lose their cattle easily , for they supposed this to be another cattle raid in which two or three men might get hurt . So they quickly formed into their rude battle formations , with their throwing assegaisat the ready . They saw the body of Shaka 's army , and it looked much like any traditional raiding party , but as they moved forward to engage it , they suddenly discovered that the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that wherever they turned they confronted swiftrunningZulu . They 'll take all our cattle ! ' the Ngwane commander shouted , but it was not cows that the Zulu sought this time . With terrifying force they fell upon the Ngwane , stabbing and killing , and when the latter bravely tried to regroup and fight in earnest , from out of nowhere sprang the iziCwe , their brutal assegais slashing like the knives that slaughtered oxen for the sacrifice.  |p388Under  this tremendous onslaught the Ngwane defenses crumbled , and those warriors who were spared the Zulu cry I have eaten ! ' scattered and kept on running . In their flight from terror they would become outlaws , seeking in the blood of others vengeance for their own crushing defeat . The kraals from which they fled were now in ashes , their herds driven off , their boys dragooned into Zulu regiments and their women distributed among the Zulu kraals . The old people were helped along to the other place , ' their slayers killing them with joy , for the Zulu saw nothing cruel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when this savage battle was over , the Ngwane had ceased to exist as a clan . Their extinction had been made possible by the disciplined performance of the iziCwe , and when the regiments returned to the Zulu kraals , Shaka praised the men and told them , to the envy of the other warriors , You may now enjoy the pleasures of the road . ' Shaka had introduced his own variation of that sexual custom : no warrior could marry until his chief gave him permission , and this was usually delayed until the soldiers were in their mid-thirties and growing too old for the crack regiments . Then , in a grand ceremony , they were permitted to search the woods for a combination of vine , gut and gum , from which they made a wide headband , woven into the hair when moist and worn for the rest of life as proof of marriage . But since it was illogical to expect grown men , and the bravest warriors at that , to remain continent till they donned their headbands , the soldiers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's warriors fanned out through the community , looking for young women , and the girls , long wondering about husbands and lovers , eagerly allowed themselves to be found . For three long days the men reveled in the glades , loving the women with passion born on the battlefield , yet practicing an almost savage restraint because they knew the fearful penalty they must pay if they got the women pregnant . Nxumalo , no less excited about the fraternizing reward than his men , had gone seeking his pleasure of the road at a kraal whose daughter he had been noticing for some time . He was now a powerfully organized man who had been in the forefront of seven battles ; he had a right to assume , therefore , that one of these years he would win permission to take a wife , but he knew that in Shaka 's regime , sex was utilized as the ultimate weapon of control . So he was determined to excel in battle so that he could go to Thetiwe to ask her to be his wife . Thetiwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftain , a girl of lovely demeanor and flashing eyes , had expected the iziCwe to perform well , which meant of course that its commanderwould come calling . So she waited alone , and when night fell she heard his steps . How was the battle ? ' she asked as he led her into a scattered wood beside the river . They are no more , the Ngwane . ' They were a troublesome people . ' ' No more . ' They spent three exciting days together , and often they talked of howp389soon Shaka might allow them to marry . Nxumalo , better aware than most of Shaka 's intentions , was not overly hopeful : Consider the situation . More than anything else , Shaka wants to build the Zulu into the commanding nation , of which he will be king . To achieve this , constant warfare is necessary . And in battle he must have one regiment he can rely on . It 'll always be the iziCwe . And I shall be fighting at its head until I 'm fifty . ' Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , she pondered the empty years till Nxumalo could claim her , and with great sadness , asked , Does n't he know that his men should marry ? ' Thetiwe , ' he replied gravely , you must never let anyone hear you ask such a question . ' But why not ? ' Because Shaka is different . He does n't think of families . He thinks only of armies and the glory to come . ' He paused , wondering if he dare discuss this matter honestly with an untested girl of sixteen , but his passion for her was so intense that he felt he must . How many wives does the chief have now ? ' In the various kraals , sixty . . . I think . ' Are any of them pregnant ? ' Oh , no ! ' But the last chief . Shaka 's father . Were his wives usually pregnant ? ' He had scores of children . ' The difference is that Shaka never sleeps with his wives . You know what he calls them ? " My beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , he fears women for two reasons . He wants no children , especially no sons . ' Why not ? You want sons , do n't you ? ' I do . I would quit the army now . . . ' He dropped that dangerous topic and continued speaking of his chief : And the other reason he fears women ... it goes back to when he was a boy . The others teased him . Told him he could never have babies . They laughed at him constantly and said no wife would ever want him . ' Now he has sixty wives , ' Thetiwe said , and they 'll probably put twenty of the captured Ngwane girls aside for him . ' But you must n't speak of this to anyone , ' Nxumalo warned , aware of what might happen to her and to him if Shaka suspected them of irreverence . She laughed . I 've known everything you 've said . What do you think the women in the kraals joke about when no one can spy on them ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes along to claim them . ' Thetiwe ! Never speak of that . ' And having observed the wrath of Shaka , the lovers were afraid even to think such thoughts , let alone voice them . Shaka had now absorbed four troublesome tribes , embracing them in my arms , ' as he said . In his utilization of the body-arms-head tactic he had become incredibly deft . Sometimes he sent one of his flanks far out and thinly spaced , their broad shields with the edges forward and thus nearlyp390invisible . Hidden in the grasses behind lurked a second group . As his army advanced , the opposing general spotted the undermanned flank and wheeled his principal force against it , but when the enemy was committed , Shaka flashed a signal , whereupon the front line of Zulu whipped their shields front forward , while the hidden men leaped into position , showing the full width of their shields also . In an instant , what had been a line of stragglers became a solid phalanx looming two or three times larger than it actually was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been marching confidently to engage an outnumbered foe fled in panic , disrupting the lines behind and inviting the massive body of the Zulu army to overwhelm them . Zulu messengers , in reporting victories , gave details in rigorous order : so many cattle taken for the chief 's pastures , so many boys for his regiments , so many girls for his kraals . The watchmen of the women selected twenty or thirty of the choicest maidens and turned the others over to the clan , and although Shaka appeared to pay little attention to his wives , any male caught lurking about the women 's compound was instantly strangled , and if the girl to whom he had been making advances could be identified , she , too , was slain . Nxumalo , obedient to each rule Shaka promulgated , spent whatever time was legally allowed with Thetiwe , and told her many things : ' Shaka is the greatest man who ever lived . A genius like no other . I 've known four chiefs , and beside him , they were boys . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All tribes combined into one . From the rivers on the north to the rivers on the south . One family , one king . ' He paused as he said this , then added , ' Shaka , King of the Zulu . ' ' But you said he almost impaled you . ' ' It was the evil spirits , not Shaka himself . They came and blinded him , but as soon as I told him who I was and his eyes opened , he spared me . ' ' But did n't you often tell me that when the tribes were united , there 'd be no more war ? ' It was the kind of probing question that Thetiwe often asked him . But he knew there must be an answer : ' It 's like this . We 're still faced by many tribes that we must defeat . This will go on for some years , but one day there will be peace . Shaka has said so . ' The king 's next actions belied this , for he authorized the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls Thetiwe 's age , and because of her impeccable lineage and her bright intelligence , she was made vice-commander of this new regiment . The girls were not intended for battle ; they were kept to the rear , performing services such as cooking , the mending of weapons and the nursing of the wounded , and quickly they learned the basic rule of Shaka 's battle plan : ' If a Zulu is wounded , speak to him . If he can understand what you 're saying , mend him . If he ca n't , call the guards . ' When the girls did summon the knobkerrie men , the latter studied the case briefly , then usually took the wounded man 's assegai and plunged it into his heart , for as Shaka said , ' If he ca n't walk , he ca n't fight . ' And this the nurses understood . The second new regiment was of quite a different character . It was almost laughable to look at , a collection of older men halt of leg and bad of eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de/manded of Shaka 's regiments , but gradually the king 's strategy became evident : These men are to receive half-rations . They 're to be worked constantly , and the sooner they die off , the better the Zulu nation will be . ' Now everyone , except the child-bearing women , was in a regiment and the nation was at last efficiently organized . Nxumalo liked the certainty this provided , the orderly progression through life with no chance for accidental deviation : a boy was born ; he tended cattle ; at eleven he was assigned a place in the cadets , a kind of pre-regiment that performed tasks for the king ; at fourteen he joined the youth 's regiment , carrying water and food to men in battle ; at nineteen he could , if he were fortunate , become a member of some renowned regiment like the iziCwe . For the next quarter of a century he would live in barracks in an orderly way , traveling to far parts of the nation where enemies existed ; and if he proved obedient , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a brief , happy life with his wife and children , and then pass on to the old men 's battalion , where he would die decently without prolonged imbecility . It was the way life should be managed , Nxumalo thought , for it helped men avoid erratic behavior and produced a disciplined , happy nation . Nxumalo also appreciated the advantage that came from having the young girls collected into their own regiment : at the conclusion of some harsh battle , when the warriors were exhausted , these girls would be sent to the proper area , and for three or four days the victors could sport with them and thus avoid the burden of returning long distances to the kraals , where girls would have to be searched for . In later days Nxumalo was astounded by an additional simplicity the king 's strategy permitted : once when the amaWombe regiment had performed especially well , Shaka rewardedit brilliantly . He marched the entire force to the parade ground , then summoned one of the girls ' regiments and announced : The men may marry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and six hundred new families were launched without interrupting army procedures . By 1823 Shaka had consolidated the major portion of his nation , bringing into carefully defined order what had previously been a mass of contending chiefdoms . He was an excellent administrator , offering positions of considerableimportance to any gifted members of defeated tribes , and recalling his own unhappy days as an alien among the Langeni , he made the newcomerstotally welcome , so that within a few months they began to forget that they had ever been anything but Zulu . Nxumalo saw that iron rule was necessary if such a patchwork of clanswas ever to become a unified kingdom ; brutal punishments were accepted , for in the black tribes the chief served as father of the people , and what displeasedhim displeased his children , who became almost eager for retribution . Shaka started his reign in accordance with tradition ; his rule was no morebloody than that of his predecessors , but as his authority widened he wastempted , like all burgeoning tyrants , to make his whim the law of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation : he lookedwith scorn at all diviners and witch doctors , for although he knew they werenecessary , he also knew they were a sorry lot . But the more he denigratedthem , the more he was tempted to usurp their power ; he became his ownp392diviner , and those about him lived in terror . A nod when he was speaking , a belch , an injudicious fart , and Shaka would point to the offender , signaling his knobkerrie team to strangle that one . But never in the early days was he a senseless tyrant ; he gave the Zulu an able , generous government . He was especially careful to ensure that his people had reliable water supplies , stable sources of food , and his care of cattle would never be excelled . His personal herds numbered above twenty thousand , and he expressed his love for them in various ways . As a Zulu , he cherished cattle above any other possession , for he knew that a man 's stature depended on the number of cattle he had been able to accumulate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it protected its animals . His herds were so large that he was able to segregate them by color , which had not only an esthetic result but also a very practical one , because the cowhide shields of various regiments could be differentiated . The iziCwe , for example , carried only white shields with black fittings . Others had black , a choice color , or brown or red , the red finding little favor , for it was thought to be unlucky . He was most careful with the animals intended for sacrifice , for upon them depended the spiritual safety of his kingdom , as well as his own . He never felt more secure than when he attended a ritual slaughter , stripped naked and washed himself in the still-warm chyme of a freshly slain bull . This thick liquid , the contents of the animal 's stomach at the completion of the digestive process , was life-giving , and to feel one 's self cleansed by it was an assurance of immortality . Even more important , however , was the precious little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which fastened to the dead animal 's liver . This was the gall bladder , in which rested the bitter fluid that symbolized life : it was acrid , like the taste of death , yet the bladder in which it lived was shaped exactly like the womb from which life sprang . Also , mysteriously , it resembled the beehive hut in which man lived , and the grave in which he ultimately rested , so that the whole of life was encompassed in this magical appendage . Once its bitter contents had been sprinkled to consecrate , it was dried into a thin leather , inflated and worn in the matted hair of witch-seekers . He was extremely loving with his mother , turning over to her the supervision of the kraals in which he kept his wives , and it was because of her attentiveness that he became aware of Thetiwe , vice-commander of one of his women 's regiments . The Female Elephant was beginning to show her age , and Shaka was terrified by the possibility that one day she might die , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eye and could not dislodge it , she began to wail so loudly that messengers were sent for the king , and when he found her in despair , he summoned all his herbalists , but before they arrived , Thetiwe , whose regiment barracked nearby , was called to the queen 's hut , and with the deftness she exhibited on so many occasions , extracted the thorn-tip which had tormented the queen . Nandi was ecstatic , and told her son , There 's a splendid woman . I 've waited all these years for you to give me a grandson . There 's the one . ' When Shaka studied his young military leader he saw quickly that his mother was right , and this frightened him , for he did not want a Paramountp393Wife nor did he want any children by one . On both accounts his thinking was clear and accurate . A king , when he was making his way , could have as many wives as he wished ; Shaka had twelve hundred now . And with them he could have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs had sixty or more . But none of this counted ; the early mothers had no special standing , for among the Zulu there was no primogeniture . What a prudent king did was wait till his reign had been securely established ; then he carefully chose from some family that could assist him in time of trouble a young woman of proved stability . She became his Paramount Wife , acknowledged by all others , and her sons stood in line to inherit the kingdom . And that 's where the trouble came , for in Zululand princes killed kings . So as soon as the Female Elephant announced that she had selected Thetiwe to be this Paramount Wife , Shaka bowed , backed out the door of his mother 's kraal , and had Nxumalo summoned : Did n't you tell me that you fancied the girl Thetiwe , of the women 's regiment ? ' I did . ' You 're to marry her this afternoon . ' Mighty Lion , I have n't cattle enough to pay lobola for such a woman . ' I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will command her family to approve . Now ! ' Hasty and flimsy arrangements were made on the spot , and before the Female Elephant could protest , a wedding was arranged . The king himself officiated , and when the witch doctors had shaken their matted locks and rattled their dried gall bladders , blessings were said and the surprised couple were married . Then , to spirit them away from Nandi 's wrath , they were sent north to conduct a negotiation which would determine the future course of their lives . Their quarry was Mzilikazi of the Kumalo clan , an extraordinary young commander who even now , at the youthful age of twenty-seven , was betrayingsigns of challenging Shaka . This Mzilikazi had refused to send Shaka three thousand cattle captured in his raids , and twice he had rebuffed emissaries sent to collect them . Now Nxumalo and Thetiwe , armed with plenipotentiary powers and one hundred warriors , went to recover the cattle . They found Mzilikazi at his unpretentious kraal in the northern forests , and when they saw him they simply could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare antagonize the King of the Zulu . But that was the case . Bowing in servility , the young leader extended every hospitality to his guests , but no cattle . Whenever Nxumalo raised the question of the cattle  --  ' The lion grows impatient , Mzilikazi , and he wants to eat '  --  the young leader smiled , blinked his hooded eyes , and did nothing . They stayed with him for two weeks , and the more they saw , the more impressed they became . One night , upon retiring , Nxumalo made a final threat  --  If we do n't take the cattle home with us , Mzilikazi , the regiments will come north '  --  and when he wakened next morning he found that all his men had been surrounded by the commander 's warriors and were immobilized . Mzilikazi ruled wisely and with a minimum of passion . He was
