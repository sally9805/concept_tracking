A feat of heart surgery sharpens the debate over benefits and costs <P> The dying heart was an I ugly yellowish color when Dr. William DeVries finally cut it loose , tore it out of the Mercurochrome-stained chest cavity , and put it to one side . For the next three hours , while a nearby heart-lung bypass machine kept the unconscious patient alive-and while a tape in the background eerily played Mendelssohn and Vivaldi-DeVries ' sure hands carefully stitched into place a grapefruit-size gadget made of aluminum and polyurethane . At 12:50 p.m. last Monday , the Jarvik-7 artificial heart newly sewn inside William J. Schroeder began beating steadily , 70 beats to the minute . When Schroeder opened his eyes 3 hours later in the intensive-care unit , DeVries bent over his patient and whispered assurances , " The operation is all through . You did really well . Everything is perfect . " <P> So , for only the second time in history , a human heart had been permanently replaced by a machine . Like a landing on the moon or a close-up photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized the world 's imagination , arousing once again a sense of shuddering awe at the incredible powers of technology , a sense that almost anything is possible , almost anything that can be imagined can be done . <P> Though nobody could predict how long the aging and diabetic Schroeder would survive-his only predecessor , Dr. Barney Clark , died after a courageous 112-day struggle last year-he was reported at week 's end to be doing " beautifully " ( see following story ) . But even if Schroeder dies soon , there will be more such operations , and even more complicated ones , in the near future . <P> The Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville , where the operation took place , has received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to perform another five artificial-heart implants . One candidate is now in the hospital for evaluation , but will most likely be turned down . At the same time , two Southern girls are scheduled for complex variations of organ replacements this month . Cynthia Bratcher , 6 , of Scottsville , Ky. , will be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart inside her . Meanwhile , Mary Cheatham , 17 , of Fort Worth , will go to Pittsburgh for simultaneous transplanting of heart and liver . ( The first recipient of such a double transplant , Stormie Jones , 7 , of Cumby , Texas , is still doing well after ten months . ) <P> In what should be a time for congratulations and rejoicing , it may seem carping to raise questions about the value of such spectacular operations , yet that is exactly what a number of medical experts were doing last week . They did so because they feel serious doubts about the whole course of high-technology medicine doubts about cost , ethics , efficiency and simple justice . <P>
