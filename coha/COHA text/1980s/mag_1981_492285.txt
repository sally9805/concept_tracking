N.Y . SCHOOL TEACHES " HOW TO MARRY MONEY " by William Barry Furlong t is Nature 's sage custom not merely to pass down the code of conduct from parent to child but from age to age in one-liners , as if insight writ in aphorism is the sluice gate of wisdom . No more baffling and maniacal one-liners exist than those on the subject of marriage , money and the mating of the two . " He who has lost a wife and sixpence has lost sixpence , " grouses an old Scots proverb . " There is a tide in the affairs of women which , taken at the flood , leads  --  God knows where , " wrote Lord Byron , who knew some very rich women  --  rather too intimately , their husbands thought . " It 's as easy to marry a rich man as a poor one , " said 9,476,824 American mothers to their daughters . Just last week as a matter of fact . It is a zany truth that everybody talks about marrying money , but nobody does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( There are , of course , many individuals who pursue the black art as a private enterprise . That , perhaps , is one of the reasons why the divorce rate is so high : The individual who has married money usually finds  --  to his or her dismay  --  that a man or woman also has been thrown into the deal . ) Now there comes along an attractive , intelligent , even sensitive woman named Joanna T. Steichen who is working at changing the institutional bias : She is teaching a course at a school in New York City called " How to Marry Money . " It is a course that takes only three hours of lecture . The lab period lasts a lifetime . The way that Joanna Steichen discusses this elevating discipline involves goals and values and an examination of self . But there are a few hints from " real life , " and from good sense that link life with its ever-present laboratory : ? Do n't go to famous resorts expecting to " bump into " somebody who 's very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach of the hotel . ( All you 'll meet in the bar are very rich bartenders . Or soon-to-be-penniless drunks . ) In fact , says Joanna , the " very , very rich really keep to themselves . When they go to those resorts , they never go to a hotel . They go to the private homes of their friends " ? homes that have their own swimming pools and private beaches and " bar nooks " the size of St. Patrick 's Cathedral . " So the idea of going to a resort and lying on the beach hoping to meet somebody rich is not a very good one . " ? Save your money to fly first class in specially planned flights . It may be at a special time that 'll attract the very rich  --  i.e. , flying to Washington when a Republican president is being inaugurated . Or it may be at a very routine time that attracts the very rich . There are airline flights almost daily that routinely attract the " chief executive officers " to their first-class sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 a.m. to fly nonstop to Los Angeles . The first-class section becomes good hunting ground for a young woman because the transcontinental distance is too far for a chief executive officer to fly , in these oil-expense days , in his private ( or corporate ) jet and because most men who are in first class have the money  --  or the expense accounts  --  to pay a lot more for a little more comfort for a short time . The woman who is traveling alone in first class has a good chance of finding , through the seat-selection procedures , that she 's got a seatmate who is male , rich and traveling alone in first class . ( If his family is with him , he 'll be sitting with his wife  --  you do n't think she 's a fool , do you ? ) If the young woman does n't get such a seatmate  --  if she gets another woman , worse luck ! ? she can tell the stewardess that her seat has too much sun or too little sun or is too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , anything , so she can change seats to sit next to a prospect . ? Do n't try to make the quarry like you . Make him feel good about himself , and he 'll respond . The hard fact is that there is so much to say about the subject that some of the best material never quite surfaces . ( The course is a one-night stand  --  what do you expect for $21 ? ) Joanna Steichen tends to stick to the broad , sweeping and genuinely vital matters . " The first thing I tell them , " she says gravely , " is where the bathrooms are . " That is good . Very good . It establishes an identification . an empathy . She 's been going to the bathroom all her life , and so , presumably , have her students . But the same can not be said of marrying money . She 's married only once  --  and the money was , to her surprise , thrown into the deal . Her husband was Edward Steichen . He was long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture on canvas , he sought to capture on film . His success made him internationally famous , celebrated among artists as well as among Kodak fiends . He mounted , among other things , the Family of Man exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1950s . ) Money was a belated experience to him . For the first 45 years of his life , " says Joanna , " he was a poor man. - Then he decided that he did n't want to do what he was doing anymore , which included  --  among other things  --  designing wallpaper for rich people . Instead , he devoted the rest of his life to taking pictures with all the art that was in his heart . He spent almost 50 years doing it . ( " He died in 1973 , just short of his 94th birthday . " ) It happened to bring him money as well as fame . Not enough to be gross about ; ' ' just enough so that he could do the things that he wanted to do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to do . " She was 50 years his junior when she married him ; they were married for the last 12 or 13 years of his life . " I did n't think I was marrying money . Just genius ... wisdom . " She 'd grown up in less-than-exalted circumstances ? " My grandfather was a shoemaker in Greenpoint . " Her career-girl status in the 1950s  --  she was a copywriter in an ad agency  --  was not spectacularly enriching : She was earning $55 a week and living in a one-room walk-up apartment in an old lower-middle-class neighborhood in Manhattan . Her marriage and her own initiative left her comfortably fixed and then some . She lives in an architect-designed , river-view duplex on Beekman Place in New York . The money gave her more than comfort  --  though she went on working for a living . " It helped me to look through the ' mystique ' of money to the infinite variety of individuals who inherit it , earn it , marry it , suffer for it or from it , enjoy it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoever marries her will not get tons of money . But he will get a lot of verbalizing about it  --  with a good dash of " wisdom " thrown in . Last spring , she spotted an ad in a New York newspaper that sought teachers for courses run by a fast-expanding organization called the Network for Learning . It is a private enterprise in the educational field  --  started by Jeffrey Hollender when he was 25 ? that is not affiliated with or accredited to an educational institution . ( It usually rents classrooms in New York City public schools for its night classes . ) The courses are short ? " People do n't want to go out several nights a week in New York for three or four months in the winter , " says Hollender  --  and have a special appeal to adults in New York . " What to do when your shrink is on vacation " is one . " Fifty ways to meet a lover " is another . " How to lose your New York accent " is still another . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible to Joanna Steichen . To be sure , she is not " marriage-minded " by instinct oravocation . And by career , she is a psychotherapist . ( She treats  --  under a license from the state  --  people who are dissatisfied , perhaps even disturbed , but  --  not to put too fine a point on it  --  not demented . Yet . ) She felt this course would put her in touch with people living with a - tolerable-  dissatisfaction , and these were likely to be people she 'd never otherwise encounter in her professional duties . Further , the subject was shadowed by a very strong taboo . " Money may represent the last bastion of prudery in contemporary society , " she says . " People will tell you the details of their sex lives freely while their tax brackets remain the mystery of mysteries . Having lots of money  --  or too little money  --  is often a more sensitive subject than divorce , sexual incompetence or ruined children . " Thus Joanna perceived that people sought money  --  even through marriage ? when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' families diligently steer their children into associations with certain kinds of people , known as ' good family , ' or ' the right kind ' or ' people with proper values . ' " Their aim , she says , is not for the kids to get better table manners , but to get boosted into boodle  --  through marriage . For the most part , courses in the Network for Learning have 15 to 20 students . Some 140 showed up for Joanna 's first class . Another class was added , and it drew between 150 and 200 students . Not all were women ; about one-third of the class was male . Not all were young . Joanna finds very , very few teenagers in the class  --  most are " over 25 , - she says , and most are " under 35 . " But she has , she says , noticed " one man who is somewhat over 50. - An optimist  --  or a very fast worker . She opens any discussion with a picky point : She is not teaching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the individual expects to be rewarded monetarily for getting married ? " That 's just a form of prostitution , " she says . But " How to Marry Money " ? with no " for " in it  --  means marrying a monied person , for himself or herself if all other reasons fail . Her next very important step is to inquire of her students what they think is real money . " Billions , - said one young woman . She wanted to " marry a multibillionaire . " That cut down the student 's opportunities somewhat , simply because the supply of " unwed " multibillionaires is limited . ( " There are fewer of them , and it takes longer to get a billion than to get a million or so . So the multibillionaire is likely to be older  --  and already married . " ) What did Joanna Steichen tell her ? " Why do n't you look around for the crowd that owns the oil supertankers . " The girl said she 'd already done that and found more tankers than takers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Joanna . " It was whether she could find the style of life that would attract the ' takers . ' " Most people said , however , that they thought " money " was an income of $100,000 a year ? " after taxes . " In a sense , that reflects how little money is actually " real " money . For $100,000 after taxes can be earned , in this period of high interest rates , on a tax-free investment of as little as $800,000 ? far less than a million dollars . One of Joanna 's most important points is that " money " does not only vary in size but in antiquity . And therefore in style . " Very old money " ? the people who look at the Rockefellers as being " new rich " ? is very shielded and secluded , not to mention insulated from reality and from the ambitious . " They are taught from childhood not to display their money before the less fortunate  --  i.e. , the rest of us ? " for fear that it will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to radical or revolutionary or utterly mad thoughts  --  such as marriage . Another group includes the " life and money managers " who serve the very rich : the lawyers , the stockbrokers , the tax advisors , the plant managers , the accountants , the foundation executives . They tend to be sharp and active : They had to earn their money ; they did n't get it by breathing regularly . To be sure , there is n't as much of it , perhaps no more than five percent of what their patrons possess . But five percent of a billion dollars is still $50 million . These money managers have their own ambition , which is to " marry up " into the very rich old set . Thusthey dislike a course like Joanna 's because they think it involves " giving away the secrets " ? i.e. , it sharpens the competition for " marrying up " by letting the commonfolk in on what 's happening . There is , they know , an even more devastating danger : Somebody " common " may figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the " new rich " ? the land speculators , the commodities brokers , the oil millionaires , the fast-food franchise owners . Joanna Steichen calls one subdivision the " snob rich " : the people who do and have only the " right things " ? the people who have the right house and the right car in the right suburb , who send their kids to the right school and work on the right charity boards and who never realize that none of this is going to get them closer to the " very old rich . " They try so very hard in order to fail at their life 's goal . The others among the " new rich " are the " slob rich -- the people who are happy following their own instincts , their own tastes , their own pleasures without worrying whether what they 're doing fits into the modes and desires of some other richer group . The point is that each person must , in an examination of self , determine what life style he 'd prefer . And what " money " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : What does the individual really want to get out of " money " ? Does he want position ? Or possessions  --  jewelry , limousines or clothes ? Or a particular life style  --  thejet-set bit ? Most people seeking to marry " money " want to be removed from their present lives without quite knowing what they want in their married lives . " They say they want money so that they can work at what they want to do , " says Joanna Steichen , " and not have to work at what they do n't want to do . " They want , in fact , freedom from a discipline imposed from outside in order to follow their own pleasures . " But most of the people I know who have a lot of money , " says Joanna Steichen , " do n't have that freedom . They have households to run . They have to manage the money . They have a great deal of continuing responsibility and work . " There is no simple way to find the money or the life style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for men , not for women . Joanna Steichen refrains from using such simplistics as " what five resorts to go to this year to catch a millionaire . " Or else what clothes to wear on what occasions to be sure to impress the quarry 's family and friends . " I 'd rather teach them how to develop their own resources so they can find those things out for themselves , " she says . Those resources are all around them . Clothes : " Read the best fashion magazines , not to see what the models are wearing but to study what the people in the more candid shots of the social gatherings of the rich are wearing . " Homes : " Study the better ' shelter ' magazines that give you several pages in color of various homes or apartments . Use them to look for their preferences  --  obviously the Manhattan penthouse of a millionaire bachelor who is into international law is going to be a great deal different than that of a young single rancher in Texas who 's just been given responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Read the obituaries . They 'll tell you what churches the rich go to , what clubs they belong to , what charity boards they served on , what schools they went to . " By far the most difficult task is " making the meet  --  finding the man or woman who is n't married and has the money and life style one prefers . There is no sure way , outside of one 's own logic and resources . The hints from within always range from the very general to the very specific , and they apply to almost every human endeavor . Shopping : Shop in the " rich man 's groceries , " what are often called " the robber barons . " The prices are higher there ; often the value is ; but the chance of meeting somebody with money is much higher than elsewhere : In New York , it is wiser to shop at Gristede 's than , say , the Grand Union . Washington even has such a place in the everyday kind of supermarket chain . It is called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper edges of Georgetown , and it 's celebrated as a place where the elite meet to greet  --  the rich politicians ( i.e. , every politician ) , the rich lawyers ( ditto ) , the newspaper publishers and columnists , the top-ranking bureaucrats ( some neither rich nor bright but merely very verbal ) and the very few who are really , really rich : the supermarket owners . The opportune encounter in a super-mart has its at-random quality  --  unless you know the rich by sight , you wo n't be able to tell them easily from the rest of us  --  but it has one enormous asset : It 's an absurdly simple place to start a conversation with a stranger . Specific : If you like art and want to search for " arty money , " you can do a lot more than simply wander around the usually empty halls of the city 's great museums . You can watch the newspapers for word of auctions of great art and see if you ca n't join the spectators . ( This is not a low-cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some of the very , very rich who are particularly interested in art . Eating places offer the same varied opportunity . General : Have breakfast in the dining rooms of the most expensive hotels in town . Why breakfast ? Because it 's a lot cheaper than dinner . Because a woman alone at breakfast does n't appear as conspicuous as at dinner alone ( she merely seems to be another person getting ready for a busy day  --  which indeed she is ) . And because the breakfast rush is  --  unlike the dinner rush  --  sometimes so intense and crowded that two individuals eatingalone may be placed at the same table , if both wish it that way . The drawback is that you do n't have a choice of fellow diners ; you wind up , at best , taking potluck . ( And do n't forget that a great many of the very , very rich call room service so they can have breakfast while starting out at a very gradual pace . ) One thing you can do to open up your prospects is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ) you 'd prefer to marry . If it 's in medicine , simply look for the conventions of the large medical societies  --  the American Medical Association , the American College of Surgeons , the American Psychiatric Association . If it 's in business , look for the convention of the American Management Association . No matter what the profession , there 's likely to be a trade association connected with it , and all you have to do is watch for that trade association to convene at a hotel convenient to you . When you go to breakfast during convention time , you can figure that most of the people in attendance will skip room service ( if only because it 's their own money they 're spending ) and that the crush in the dining room at breakfast will be so great that all " singles " will be sharing tables . That gives you an entree for meeting more and more of the conventioneers and perhaps expanding your contacts during the rest of the day . Specific : Frequent the particular eating place where your quarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely to be there . In the building where the commodity exchange is located in Chicago , there is a restaurant that does an incredible , booming **29;4203;TOOLONG business that is all-male . The customers are the men who 've spent the day in the frantic hysteria of the exchange floor ; when the exchange finally closes in midafternoon , these men rush down to the eating place and bar to work off their nervous tensions . They are wild , loud , raucous , grabby ( the waitresses , in an excess of kindness , call them " the animals " ) , but they are always there at a certain time . And they are available : Any young woman who visits the restaurant at the right time will have no difficulty in maintaining a conversation ; her only difficulty will be in maintaining her life and virtue . The transportation syndrome is yet another example of general/specific . General : Always sit in the first-class lounge while waiting for the takeoff of overseas flights ( particularly American carriers , assuming you do n't want to meet foreign men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " exclusive " constant-passenger 's club ( the Admiral 's Club , etc. ) on days when you know that the weather is so bad that there 'll be a lot of flight delays ( and thus a lot of " rich " people waiting in those clubs . ) Remember : Always dress and act as if you belong there . Then even if you only have a coach ticket , you 'll be challenged only rarely , if ever . An alternative is to buy one first-class ticket one way , make a reservation on an appropriate overseas flight and get out to the airport early to scout the first-class lounge . Then cancel your reservation before the flight takes off ( always assuming you have n't found anybody interesting enough to tempt you to take the flight ) . But do n't turn in the ticket . Save it until you can get to the airport again . Make another reservation on a first-class flight , have the ticket updated at the counter and then go sit in the first-class lounge again . Keep doing this over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always being prepared to take the flight if you happen to meet an enchanting prospect . It 's true that you have a good deal of money tied up in that ticket , but prospecting for gold has always required a continuing and December ' 81 basic investment . Specific : Find out if the commuter train which runs into the center-city from the suburbs of the very , very rich has a special car for " special " customers . If so , make yourself a reservation on it , if possible for as short a period as the company will allow . Even if you have to pay outrageous premium prices . An example : One morning a commuter train from Lake Forest , Illinois  --  home of the very old rich and their monied managers  --  to Chicago had a special parlor car attached to it where a very exclusive clientele could share their privileges in the morning . ( The privileges included coffee , papers , perhaps a hangover pill , phones if one made the request early and the assurance that nobody would be tramping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " special " car was locked and nobody closer to the city was ever permitted to enter it . ) The riders paid for it  --  paid heavily , as a matter of fact  --  but they could afford it . Once it was an all-male enclave , but that ca n't be maintained easily in today 's climate . A young woman entering this scenario would have to find a place to live in or around Lake Forest and its train station ; she 'd have to pay the premium price for getting onto the parlor car ; and she 'd have to exercise a great deal of discretion . But if she was successful in all three , she 'd have a parlor car full of rich men  --  some of them relatively young  --  and she 'd have them all to herself for the hour-long commuter ride into Chicago 's near-Loop every morning . In all of these cases , the young woman wants to be noticed for her splendid good taste . But there are circumstances  --  where the competition is quite high  --  where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " people " of those circumstances involve show-biz , media monsters , politicians , lawyers and other people of questionable taste . ) In such circumstances , the woman may want to wear a bright and attention-grabbing button . Or a T-shirt , suitably snug , that presents a bright saying . Joanna Steichen does not expect to have to tell this to people . She expects that they can figure it out for themselves . And come up with things to tell her . It is not book-larnin ' that expands knowledge in this field because there are no textbooks on the subject . But there is a good deal of word of mouth on it . There always has been . The difference with Joanna Steichen on the scene is that the knowledge is being solidified  --  and perhaps even institutionalized.
