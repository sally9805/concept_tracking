Since 1983 , Honduran military officials have pressed Washington to provide them with sophisticated jet fighters . The Reagan Administration has now decided to honor that request , despite its previous refusals to supply Honduras with advanced warplanes . Instead of the U.S. F-5s that they originally requested , however , the Hondurans have opted to use U.S. military aid to buy 18 Israeli Kfir jets . " We saw problems from the American Congress in getting the F-5s , " said a Honduran official . <P> The U.S. also agreed to help Honduras upgrade its existing squadron of a dozen French Super Mystere fighter jets , half of which are in disrepair . Even without the Kfir jets , Honduras enjoys air superiority over neighboring Nicaragua , and the U.S. decision is likely to make the Sandinistas more eager to obtain MiG-21s from the Soviet Union .
