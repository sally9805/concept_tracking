The dollar ended up narrowly mixed in light New York trading after recovering from a round of profit-taking in overseas markets . Traders ' confidence in the U.S. currency was bolstered by a Reagan administration official ' s comment that the dollar ' s recent strength shouldn ' t pose problems for U.S. industry . The early selling came mostly in Tokyo , where investors took profits on the dollar ' s move above 150 Japanese yen , which began Tuesday . Other traders sold the dollar over Wednesday ' s rumor that the West German central bank was intervening to restrain its rise . " That seemed to sober the market a little bit and kept the bulls subdued , " Joseph Volpicella , executive vice president of Spavo Financial Corp. , a New York currency-trading firm , said . In early European trading , the dollar slid to its intraday lows of 149. 16 yen and 1. 8325 West German marks .

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter helped the dollar by telling a news briefing he wasn ' t concerned about the currency ' s rise against the yen in recent days . The dollar ' s rise above 150 yen Tuesday was its first in 3 1/2 months and caused speculation that the U.S. and its major allies might move to weaken the currency . Washington has been trying to maintain a relatively low exchange rate for the dollar to make U.S. products more competitive in world markets and reduce the U.S. trade deficit . Mr. Yeutter said U.S. exports are still competitive at an exchange rate of 150 yen and that the current yen-dollar rate won ' t abort a rise in U.S. exports to Japan . " We are competitive in a lot of things at that rate , " he said . Separately , a Bank of Norway official confirmed that the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise over the past several days .

In addition , Bank of Norway statistics show that the central bank sold about 1. 4 billion kroner in the last five days of June to halt the currency ' s rise .
