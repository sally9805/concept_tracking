At 17 , Tim Cislaw of Costa Mesa , Calif. , seemed to have it all : suntanned good looks , natural athletic and artistic talent , and popularity . One night last March , while recovering from the flu , he took a few drags on a kretek , or clove cigarette , an Indonesian concoction of tobacco and cloves that has become popular with teen-agers across the nation . Soon he was gasping for breath , and by the next day he was in an intensive-care unit suffering from what appeared to be an unusually severe type of pneumonia . " He had cysts the size of golf balls in his lungs , " says Thoracic Surgeon Frederick Schechter , who treated him at Humana Hospital in West Anaheim . In May , despite massive doses of antibiotics and four operations , Tim Cislaw died . <P> Schechter has since seen two other teen-agers with dangerously inflamed lungs apparently related to kreteks . Like Cislaw , one of the victims had been suffering from a virus at the time that he smoked the cigarettes . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast around 1980 . Now , says Beatrice Schwalbe , 19 , a former two-pack-a-day kretek smoker from Costa Mesa , " anywhere you find a bunch of teen-agers , you 'll find clove cigarettes . " New York City Importer George Georgopulo reports that sales of the two leading brands  --  Jakarta and Djarum  --  have jumped 40% in the past year alone . <P> Though billed as an herbal , low-tobacco substitute for regular cigarettes , kreteks actually contain 60% tobacco and at least as much tar and nicotine as regular cigarettes . They also contain eugenol , a natural anesthetic found in cloves . Although eugenol has long been used by dentists to relieve pain , " no one knows what happens when it is burned , " says Dr. Tee Guidotti , professor of occupational medicine at the University of Alberta in Edmonton . <P> Guidotti , working with Schechter , suspects that eugenol  --  or some byproduct created when it is burned  --  immobilizes infection-fighting cells , allowing viruses and bacteria already present in the lungs to run amuck . The other possibilities , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct toxic effect or that it triggers an acute allergic reaction . Last month the American Lung Association issued a preliminary warning about clove cigarettes , and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta plan to look for further evidence of kretek-induced illness . <P> Schechter thinks the CDC will find a rash of cases . Since the Los Angeles Times carried a story about Cislaw , Schechter 's office has been flooded with hundreds of calls from clove smokers complaining of shortness of breath , nosebleeds , nausea , lung infections and asthma . " About 30% to 35% said they were coughing up blood , " he says . " Emergency rooms have n't seen a symptom like that since TB was in style . "
