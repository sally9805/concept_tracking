The President should announce that the US is willing to scrap the MX missile system - and ban all future deployment of multiple-warhead missiles based on land - if the Soviets will join the US in a genuine phased reduction of existing MIRVed ICBMs to some common low ceiling . If the Soviets are willing to go all the way down to zero , we should be prepared to match them in this destabilizing category of weaponry. // For the US this proposal would mean forgoing both the MX missile system in its current design and the possibility of replacing some single-warhead Minuteman II missiles with triple-warhead Minuteman IIIs . For the Soviet Union this scheme would reverse the buildup of land-based MIRVed missiles and redirect any further effort to smaller , mobile , less theatening single-warhead missiles . For the Reagan administration this proposal has a number of virtues , not the least of which is that it offers a way out of the self-inflicted problem with MX. // By now it is apparent that the MX missile is a strategic orphan , a 190 , 000-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter ' s system of road loops in the Western desert was technically sound but crushingly expensive , and in any event was unacceptable to ecologists , the Mormon Church , and the local populace . Almost no one likes the current plan to house MXs temporarily in existing Minuteman silos . After all , it was the vulnerability of such silos which gave rise to MX in the first place . Few find any appeal in the future basing mode which Defense Secretary Weinberger is said to find most attractive : putting the missiles on far-ranging , slow-moving , fuel-efficient airplanes. // The plain fact is that the big multi-warhead MX missile was a bad idea from the start . Making a 190 , 000-pound missile mobile is about as simple as constructing a movable football stadium . Putting 10 warheads on the missile simply gives the adversary a greater incentive to try to find it . In the end , if the MX is ever deployed , it will almost certainly be housed in fixed silos ( for want of any reasonable alternative ) , and it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of a complex mobile basing mode , but it will require the purchase of a ballistic missile defense - and the renegotiation or abrogation of the 1972 ABM Treaty. // At this point President Reagan and his national security team probably wish that the MX would go away , that they could start anew on the design of a mobile missile system . What the US really needs is a whole new missile  --  smaller , cheaper , and more mobile than MX . In mobile missiles , big is bad and small is beautiful. // The idea of a small intercontinental ballistic missile  --  ' ' SICM ' ' for short , or perhaps ' ' Midgetman ' '  --  has been around for some time . A SICM could be designed to weigh about 20 , 000 pounds , about a tenth the weight of the MX , and carry a single warhead in contrast to the 10 on MX . It could be carried on a truck or railroad car , giving the smaller missile a versatility and mobility which would be impossible for MX. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own merits , but getting something from the Soviets for such a move makes the idea even more attractive. // Right now the Soviets have over 800 MIRVed ICBMs , 250 more than the US . These are the most destablilizing weapons in the Soviet inventory . It was these weapons which gave rise to fears of a Soviet preemptive attack . The Soviets now have enough warheads in their land-based missile force to direct two at every American ICBM , and still hold a comfortable force in reserve . But all is not well for the Soviets . They have their own window of vulnerability opening on the horizon. // Over 70 percent of Soviet megatonnage resides in fixed-silo ICBMs . If the US ever does deploy MX it will give the Soviets the same concern about preemptive attack which they are now giving us  --  with one big difference . While the US worries about losing a quarter of its megatonnage to a Soviet first strike , the Soviet Union would stand to lose nearly three-quarters of its nuclear might if the US went first . The anxieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch their missiles first , thinking their choice is to ' ' use ' em or lose ' em . ' ' Given this impending problem , it is in the US interest to encourage the Soviets to shift to smaller , mobile missiles with single warheads . We would feel more secure ; they would feel less threatened . Strategic stability would be greatly enhanced. // There is a problem with this proposal , but it is not an insurmountable one . The mobility which makes a SICM-type missile so attractive for strategic purposes also makes it a problem for arms control . Since the missiles are small and easily transported , the total number of such missiles would be difficult to monitor . Without high confidence in verification , the US would almost certainly not accept a limit on the total number of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles. // Verification will be a real problem in the future even if SICMs are never deployed . Cruise missiles pose an even greater challenge to detection capabilities . Despite this problem , it is not inconceivable that US and Soviet arms negotiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new hard-to-find weapons like cruise missiles and SICMs . In any event , a major reduction in the most destabilizing sub-class of strategic weapons , land-based MIRVed missiles , is important in its own right and should not be delayed until Moscow and Washington can conclude another comprehensive agreement covering all strategic offensive forces. // Much has been written about the alleged ' ' dangers ' ' of arms control , the tendency of earlier administrations to put arms control ahead of strategic doctrine . This proposal puts arms control in the service of defense strategy . A ban on new land-based MIRVed missiles and a phased reduction in existing inventories of such missiles would use arms control to further US strategic interests - and would produce a more stable , less threatening strategic balance between the two nuclear superpowers. // //
