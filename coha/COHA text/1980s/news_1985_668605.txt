The Body Politic Theatre almost was wrestled to the ground on a couple of occasions , but its backers refused to cry " uncle . " Even managing director Sharon Phillips admits that it was touch and go at times , but the theater never gave up . This Thursday , the Body Politic celebrates its 15th anniversary with the opening of " Madwoman of Chaillot , " and a celebration is deserved  --  just for surviving . The theater building nearly was demolished twice . Shortly after the old Monte Carlo bowling alley was purchased and named the Body Politic , the city announced plans to tear down the entire 200 block of North Lincoln Avenue . After a long battle with City Hall , the theater people convinced the city to change its mind . Then , in 1973 , an electrical fire nearly destroyed the building . It took almost a year to rebuild . But performances in the small studio space never stopped . In the late 1970s and early ' 80s , off-Loop theaters were hit especially hard by the economy . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Body Politic would join their ranks . " When I entered as artistic director in 1980 , there was big financial trouble , " recalled James O ' Reilly . " People were predicting our demise and that the building would be sold . Sharon ( Phillips ) was determined to get the financial backing for at least one more production . " Somehow , Phillips succeeded . O ' Reilly chose to stage Shakespeare ' s " Twelfth Night . " The play earned critical acclaim , four Joseph Jefferson nominations and  --  most importantly  --  an audience . " It was the springboard for not only that season , but everything to follow , " O ' Reilly said . It ' s true that the Body Politic may be only a small pond . After all , it ' s only an off-Loop theater . But don ' t underestimate its importance . It ' s amazing how much life can emanate from even the smallest of ponds .

" Other companies included Pary Productions , The Puppet Place , Dinglefest Theatre ( now Performance Community ) and the Organic Theatre Company , with its first performance of " Warp . " The building also offered new playwrights a venue . David Mamet ' s first work , " Duck Variations , " was presented in 1972 . The Body Politic began to produce its own shows in 1976 and has been ever since . Here are a few of the highlights :  --  " Who ' s Happy Now ? "  --  The first show the Body Politic could call its own in 1976 . This adult comedy starred Jack Wallace , now appearing on Broadway.  --  " Lunching "  --  The first all-Chicago production , with Chicago playwright ( Alan Gross ) , producer , director ( Mike Nussbaum ) and actors intact to move into a downtown theater , after a long run at the Body Politic in 1978 .

It played for six months in 1979.  --  " Macbeth "  --  The first major Shakespearean triumph in an off-Loop theater was staged in 1980.  --  " The Dresser "  --  Appeared in 1983 to sold-out houses as Body Politic was the first theater in America to attempt this challenging script after its Broadway run . It earned two Jeff nominations . O ' Reilly is worried more about future goals that past achievements . He says that he ' s considering reviving " The Dresser . " Phillips suggests that the play may appear in tandem with " King Lear . " O ' Reilly adds : " We will continue performing pieces with glorious language . That includes classics , such as Shakespeare . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to develop our ensemble of actors and to encourage the commissioning of plays written specifically for us . Most of all , I intend to make certain we continue to present thought- provoking work . " Not bad for a small pond . What : " Madwoman of Chaillot " Where : Body Politic Theatre , 2261 N.
