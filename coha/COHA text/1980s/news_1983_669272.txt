The best example is Luis Bunuel , who started his career with the strange dreamscapes of ' ' Un Chien Andalou , ' ' then stuck to his surrealist guns through dozens of features that have stirred and delighted millions of viewers around the world. // Another is David Lynch , whose bizarre ' ' Eraserhead ' ' introduced visual themes that later enriched his Oscar-nominated ' ' The Elephant Man . ' ' There ' s also Martin Brest , who explored similar ideas in the wacky ' ' Hot Tomorrows ' ' and the Hollywood hit ' ' Going in Style. ' ' // The latest member of this select group is Peter Greenaway , a British filmmaker of unusual gifts . His new picture , The Draughtsman ' s Contract , should appeal to all sorts of viewers : mystery fans , history buffs , art lovers. // Yet it has strange byways , too . The elegant atmosphere is interrupted by nudity and bathroom humor that are sure to offend some people ( the kind of thing that ' s absent , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flights of sheer fancy spring up now and then , seeming to veer away from the film ' s rigorous structure . It ' s an odd picture , for all its period details and classical plot twists . Those familiar with Greenaway ' s career will find in it much that ' s new , but also strong echoes of his earlier films - personal , idiosyncratic , even eccentric works. // ' ' The Draughtsman ' s Contract ' ' takes place in 1694 . It begins when a wealthy woman hires an artist to draw pictures of her estate as a gift for her traveling husband . The artist , who ' s also a scoundrel , insists on sexual favors as payment . This arranged , he starts rendering the house and grounds with proud precision . But distractions abound - from sheep cluttering the landscape to a seductress on his trail. // Bit by bit , the interruptions become disruptions . Ambiguities deepen into mysteries . Unexplained objects crop up in the draftsman ' s drawings , implicating him in a sinister scheme . Comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It ' s an engaging tale with a chilling conclusion . But storytelling is only one of Greenaway ' s goals . As he told me during a recent conversation : ' ' It ' s a film about representation and ways of seeing . It ' s about what the draftsman sees , what the camera sees , what the moviegoer sees . It has many levels and references . Some people feel it says more about literature and painting than about filmmaking , and I like that. . . . ' ' // This talk about ' ' levels ' ' may surprise those who see the film as a mystery yarn in the Agatha Christie mold . It is that . But it ' s also crammed with the puzzles , allusions , artistic flotsam , and intellectual jetsam that have dotted Greenaway pictures for years. // Indeed , the real surprise is the film ' s traditional format . ' ' Some people in England think I ' ve ratted out , ' ' Greenaway says . ' ' But my main concerns about aesthetics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conventional modes . It was a necessary step if I wanted to get greater credibility with larger audiences. ' ' // In sum , Greenaway has tried to deal in popular terms with challenging issues . On the most casual level , the film joins ' ' whodunit ' ' formulas to jokes , romance , scenery , and intrigue . More subtly , it reflects a fascination with literary dialogue , painterly compositions , and complicated cinematic structures. // Greenaway ' s interest in these matters began when he was about 12 and decided to be a painter . But he was concerned that landscape , his first love , had been fully explored by earlier artists . Eventually he went to work for a film editor , deciding that cinema gave the means for a reconsideration of landscape - and for a marriage of art and literature , which gripped him equally. // Before long Greenaway made his mark with a string of stunningly imaginative but highly unorthodox films . ' ' A Walk Through H ' ' is a guided tour of a mysterious inner landscape mapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Features Remake ' ' is a riotous parody of filmmaking and criticism , mingling exquisite landscapes and outrageous editing . The fictional ' ' Windows ' ' and the factual ' ' Act of God ' ' examine documentary techniques. // Most imposing of all is ' ' The Falls , ' ' a three-hour fantasy that reveals a post-apocalyptic world through 92 fictitious biographies. // In building his unique approach to film , Greenaway saw himself following ' ' the English tradition for the bizarre , ' ' citing such forebears as Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear . ' ' I share this interest in the weird , strange , unusual , surreal , ' ' he says . He also notes that the depiction of landscape is an English tradition in both painting and literature. // Like Stan Brakhage and a few other film poets , Greenaway is a self-confessed romantic . He shuns the extremes of romanticism , though , and tries to pin down his romantic urges with a hard-edged approach . His ' ' structural ' ' background gives a framework , he feels , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting styles . Structural techniques also help him combine words and images with prodigal freedom . ' ' I was always a very literary painter , ' ' he owns , ' ' in the tradition where word and image are always equidistant and vying with one another. ' ' // All the elements of Greenaway ' s odyssey are visible in ' ' The Draughtsman ' s Contract ' ' - in its exacting dialogue , its lush settings , its immaculate construction . Though the story is strong , what really matters is how the movie proceeds on its own terms , like the surging Michael Nyman music that courses through it. // Greenaway has changed a lot since his early days in film , when he wanted to discover ' ' what would happen if you chucked the narrative out . ' ' His next projects both have strong stories - the titles are ' ' Drowning by Numbers ' ' and ' ' A Z and Two Noughts ' ' - and he plans to film them as soon as funding ( never easy to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also coming soon is a series of documentaries on musicians John Cage , Philip Glass , Robert Ashley , and Meredith Monk . When not actively involved on a personal project or feature , he earns his living by documentary filmmaking , which he thoroughly enjoys. // And after these efforts ? It ' s hard to say . But chances are it will be something challenging , allusive , elusive . ' ' I enjoy complex films and artifacts , ' ' he says . ' ' Nothing is simple , after all . There are thousands of motivations for every act that goes into a work of art . . . . ' ' <> <> Big budgets are in - again // After the colossal failure of the colossally expensive ' ' Heaven ' s Gate ' ' in 1980 , Hollywood began to think twice about the virtue of big budgets. // But moods come and go quickly in tinseltown , and sure enough , studio money is once more flowing like water . According to Variety , the show-business newspaper , two years of belt-tightening are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature films since the 1960s ' ' - with some 70 movies now in production with price tags of $15 million or more , due for release over the next three years. // In practical terms , this reflects the money-slanted mentality that often prevails in Hollywood , with its belief that big investments are the surest way to big profits . When a low-budget smash like ' ' Rocky ' ' rebuts this idea , the lesson is generally remembered for only a few months. // In artistic terms , the emphasis on huge budgets can be harmful , because torrential cash flows and gargantuan production values can mask the inner emptiness of a screenplay , a director ' s vision , even an entire project. // That ' s one reason a ' ' Heaven ' s Gate ' ' could proceed through the long production process without anyone ' s noticing it was a bomb . And the same story is likely to be repeated somewhere along the line , if Hollywood keeps gearing up its moneybags without giving more profound attention to what ' s going before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
