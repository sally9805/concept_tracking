Buffeted by a chilling wind that funneled down the gorges of the Panjshir Valley in northeast Afghanistan , three horsemen urged their mounts up a rocky defile at a punishing trot . Traders and refugees walking the same path late last month could tell by the men 's heavy field jackets and Soviet-made automatic rifles that they were officers of the mujahedin , the Afghan resistance fighters who now control the once fiercely contested valley . Few of the walkers bothered to look carefully at the sparsely bearded , intense face of the lead rider as he passed . Had they done so , they would have recognized a man who has become a legend across Afghanistan , the " Lion of the Panjshir . " <P> Ahmad Shah Massoud , 35 , a onetime engineering student at the Soviet Polytechnic Institute in Kabul , has spent the past nine years molding the mujahedin in Afghanistan 's northeast into what is widely considered the country 's most effective guerrilla formation . Last May Massoud 's men , who owe allegiance to Jamiat-i-Islami , one of the seven mujahedin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph as the last Soviet and Afghan government troops retreated from the Panjshir . <P> After nine years of fighting , mujahedin can drive their few vehicles through the valley in daylight with little worry of attack . The government withdrawal from the Panjshir has prompted hopes in Kabul that Massoud might be coaxed into a cease-fire or even a coalition . According to Massoud , President Najibullah has even offered him a choice of top government posts in exchange for peace . <P> In a mud-walled farmhouse three days ' ride from the Panjshir Valley , Massoud is asked if he would consider dealing with Najibullah . Amid interruptions from aides bringing intelligence reports scribbled on scraps of paper , the guerrilla chief declares , " There is no possibility of coexistence with the Communists . " <P> Never staying in the same house for more than a few hours , Massoud lives in constant motion . Several assassination attempts by government agents and Soviet commandos have forced him to behave like a hunted man . Beyond that , overseeing an estimated 50,000 rebel fighters demands constant meetings with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics if they are to oust the government , but they must also position themselves to determine which among the main insurgent groups will predominate once the government in Kabul falls . Though it is impossible to predict which group will be the most influential , Massoud obviously intends Jamiat-i-Islami to play a key role . <P> In the military area , Massoud believes that the mujahedin must strike a decisive blow soon , before Najibullah can adjust to the departure of the Soviets , who are scheduled to complete their troop withdrawal by Feb. 15 . The government has 150,000 troops dug in around major cities . To face them in a final showdown , Massoud is training 10,000 men , initial units of an " Islamic army , " to fight like a conventional force , rather than as hit-and-run marauders . Training , in camps spread along the rugged northern flanks of the Hindu Kush , includes the use of U.S.-supplied Stinger antiaircraft missiles as well as heavy artillery , rockets and a few highly treasured tanks . " But , " Massoud concedes , " we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
