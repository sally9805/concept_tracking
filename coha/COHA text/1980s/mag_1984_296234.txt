The Pentagon works to burnish its election-year image <P> As the defense budget has grown , so has the flurry of press reports critical of military procurement policies . New horror stories of $180 flashlights and $7,600 coffeemakers appear almost daily . Partly in self-defense , the Pentagon has launched an election-season blitz to publicize its efforts to keep costs under control . <P> The media campaign surfaced last week when the citizens ' lobby Common Cause released a memo it had obtained , written by a Pentagon public relations officer , Kathleen Troia . The memo calls for high-profile speeches by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , a vigorous " letter-to-the-editor " campaign , and the enlistment of local base commanders around the country to win " public understanding and support " for the Administration 's management of military programs . The media barrage , which was approved by Weinberger , spans a period beginning two days after Labor Day and ending Nov. 3 , three days before the election . Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer asked Congress to investigate whether the Pentagon was improperly using public funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense for Public Affairs : " I do n't think it is political at all . What we 're doing is responding to our critics , be they Republican or Democrat . " <P> In fact , there is evidence that the military has made some good-faith efforts to solve the procurement problem . Navy Secretary John Lehman announced last week that he was seeking a second supplier for the superthrust F404 engine , which powers the F-18 fighter-bomber . Weinberger also showed a willingness to crack down . He told Congress that he would not ask for more money in fiscal 1985 to buy the Army 's problem-plagued Sergeant York antiaircraft gun pending further tests , and indicated that the weapon might be terminated altogether . The Army had planned to buy 618 of the guns by 1987 ( estimated cost : $4.5 billion ) . Before a Senate subcommittee , Lieut . General Louis Wagner Jr . admitted that the gun 's guidance system worked so poorly in tests that it could not get a bead on a whirring helicopter even when the chopper was standing still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle , a cannon-equipped personnel carrier . A Pentagon memo made public past week , written by a colonel well acquainted with the vehicle , criticized the Army 's failure to submit the Bradley to realistic tests . The $1.5 million vehicle is clad with aluminum armor that some critics claim would vaporize when hit by high-explosive antitank projectiles , creating a deadly fireball inside the fuel-and ammunition-laden tank . The manufacturer claims the tank 's armor " does not burn when hit . " So far , the Army has refused to load a Bradley with fuel and ammunition and fire a real rocket at it . According to an Aug. 24 memo written by James Wade Jr. , a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering , virtually no U.S. equipment is tested under live firing conditions because the costs would be too high . <P> <P> - By Susan Tifft . <P> <P> Reported by Bruce van Voorst/Washington
