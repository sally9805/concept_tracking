Did someone forget to inform Robert Townsend that a Hollywood picture costs serious money , like $15 million ? Why else would anyone have the nerve to launch a movie on a savings account of just $20,000 ? For Townsend , the film 's director and star , a strong entrepreneurial urge overcame weak financing . When the director 's cash ran out , he simply started using his two credit cards . Then he applied for twelve more of them to pay for film , costumes , rental equipment and food . He even paid his actors by filling up their gas tanks and charging it . His artful dodging finally paid off when he showed a rough version of the film to Producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. , whose independent movie company decided to give Townsend the financial backing to finish and distribute the picture . Even so , Hollywood Shuffle , a satire about struggling black actors that opened last week in Manhattan and Washington , cost less than $1 million . <P> Directors and producers with Townsend 's kind of moxie are storming the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer do the seven major studios and several so-called mini-majors have a lock on what is shown in U.S. movie houses . More than 350 independent films were produced worldwide in 1986 , an increase of nearly 60% from the previous year . While such independent cinema was once synonymous with sexploitation pictures and artsy foreign films , the new wave of modestly budgeted movies is gaining widespread acceptance at the multiplexes in Everytown , U.S.A. <P> Filmdom 's establishment has good reason to be envious , since independents are stealing the most prestigious scenes . When the Academy Awards ceremony takes place next week , the spotlight will shine on two independently produced films , Platoon and A Room with a View , which led the nominations with eight apiece . Last year the top acting Oscars went to A Trip to Bountiful and Kiss of the Spider Woman ; both were the work of an independent studio , Island Pictures . The major studios left an opening for such films by sticking too long with expensive formulas calling for car chases , special effects and predictable stars . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation is developing a taste for movies about relationships and , eccentric characters , films that often take less money but more ingenuity to make . <P> Yet when it comes to profits , the most successful independent movies would put many major-studio pictures to shame . Platoon , which cost $6 million , has grossed $93 million so far , while the $3.5 million A Room with a View is expected to bring in more than $50 million worldwide . Even so , independent productions remain highly risky investments , since fully half of such films never find distributors willing to handle them .
