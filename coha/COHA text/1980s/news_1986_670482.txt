All of this , of course , is in the current vogue for correct Baroque style and sounds fine . The question remains whether the conductor can bring the music to life in these terms - too many musicians assume that if you have the right forces the music will take care of itself . Mr. Gardiner begins the Mass disappointingly . He has chosen a tempo for the Kyrie that is meaningless , being neither slow nor fast enough to suggest any emotional impulse . From then on , however , the performance becomes assertive and generates interest. // The conductor often opts for brisk tempos , which give an exhilaration , sometimes joyousness , to a movement , notably the " Cum Sancto Spiritu . " ( The speed here is such that the choir sounds like the Swingle Singers . ) There is a nice dancelike quality to the " Domine Deus , " and the " Qui tollis " is affecting . All told , this is a worthy , intelligent account of one of the great pieces in choral literature. // A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in Karl Munchinger ' s recording of two of the most popular cantatas : No. 80 , " Ein ' feste Burg ist unser Gott , " and No. 140 , " Wachet auf , ruft uns die Stimme " ( London CD 414045-2 LH ; LP 414045-1 LH ; cassette 414045-4 LH ) . Mr. Munchinger , a highly respected veteran and Bach interpreter , leads the Hymnus Boys ' Choir of Stuttgart and his own Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra . The distinguished soloists are Gabriele Fontana , soprano ; Julia Hamari , alto ; Gosta Winbergh , tenor , and Tom Krause , bass. // This is good traditional standard Bach , the performances full-bodied and avoiding exaggerations of tempo . In fact , there is a certain amount of what is called " sewing machine " rhythms in the regularity of the pacing . The soloists are generally excellent , even if their voices lean toward the operatic rather than toward the more desirable and purer Baroque quality . Miss Fontana has a warm voice , with maybe more of a vibrato than one might wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krause in particular does himself proud. // Finally there is Joshua Rifkin ' s account of two Magnificats , the one in D minor by Bach and a German one by Melchior Hoffmann ( Pro Arte LP PAD 185 ; CDD 185 ) . Mr. Rifkin has argued fairly persuasively that some of Bach ' s music shoud be sung with one voice to a part . ( How many small ensembles , especially in churches , haven ' t had to sing Bach out of necessity with only a couple of voices to a part , and this long before small choral groups were fashionable for Baroque music ! ) Here the Magnificat sounds superior in Mr. Rifkin ' s basic style . At least on a recording there is no loss of vocal impact , although just possibly the Gloria would profit from greater fullness of tone generated by more singers . But the clarity and suppleness of the singing is most impressive , having the services of five first-rate American artists : Jane Bryden and Julianne Baird , sopranos ; Jeffrey Gall , alto ; Frank Hoffmeister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bach Ensemble uses Baroque-style instruments , to make the whole performance admirable. // The relatively brief German Magnificat in A minor of Melchior Hoffmann ( c. 1679-1715 ) is a charming , almost light-hearted work that makes a pleasant pendant to the Bach . The work , as a matter of fact , was once attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach , then to Telemann before the final research that proved it to have come from Hoffmann ' s pen . It is short , for solo soprano , a few strings and organ , and is something of a find. // While so many are striving to arrive ever closer to " authentic " Bach performances , others are still pursuing the business of transcribing his works for " nonauthentic " performances in a time-honored tradition . The violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky has taken the " Goldberg " Variations , originally for keyboard , and set them for string trio . They can be heard on an Orfeo recording ( LP S 138851 A ) . // Whether the transcription needed to be done is debatable , but at least Mr. Sitkovetsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion . Despite the change in instrumental texture , the writing and the playing produce a homogeneous sound that does justice to the whole , yet there are enough changes in the different variations to avoid monotony . Mr. Sitkovetsky ' s colleagues in the recordings are Gerard Causse , violist , and Misha Maisky , cellist . The three sound as one . A score of the transcription is included with the recording. // Mr. Sitkovetsky also has an album devoted to the six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin by Bach ( Orfeo LP S 130853 F , three disks ) . The Soviet-born artist , who now lives in the United States , has an extremely strong style , abetted to some extent by a rather wiry violin tone . It works exceptionally well here . One can listen to all the pieces at one sitting without growing weary of the sound ( the music , of course , is pretty wonderful ) . The aggressiveness of attack keeps the ear alert , as does the propulsive phrasing . The violinist can be meditative where it is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of albums devoted to these works. // Among recent recordings of Bach ' s organ music is one of special interest . It was made by Hans Fagius , a Swedish musician , on a reconstructed Baroque organ in Kristine Church , Falun , Sweden ( Bis LP 235/6 , two disks ) . This Volume I in what promises to be a recording of all the Bach organ music includes the 18 Leipzig chorales ( BWV 651-668 ) and the six Schubler chorales ( BWV 645-650 ) . The organ was originally built in 1724 by Johan Niclas Cahman , called " The Father of Swedish Organ Building . " The new instrument was reconstructed in his style , with 300 pipes of the original organ included among its current 1 , 900 . In this initial album the music sounds ideal , given the appropriate timbres and the sensitive playing of Mr. Fagius. //
