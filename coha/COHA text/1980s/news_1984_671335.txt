The Senate is preparing to vote this week on a hotly debated bill to restrict the export of high technology to the Soviet Union and other countries . And a staff report to the National Academy of Sciences has complained that the Reagan Administration ' s effort to restrict the flow of technical information and equipment to foreign nations is far more restrictive than an academy panel had recommended. // Meanwhile , both the Pentagon and Commerce Department are developing new regulations governing the dissemination of information that , while unclassified , might be of military value . And an interagency group headed by the White House science office and the National Security Council is attempting to develop guidelines for the entire Government. // The steady drumbeat of activity is creating waves of apprehension among scientists . A delegation of university presidents , led by Paul Gray of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , visited Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger last month to express concern that the country ' s scientific productivity might be harmed by an overzealous crackdown . Another group was convened by the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations recently proposed by the Commerce Department. // The Background // Concern over the leakage of scientific data and sophisticated technology was raised in January 1982 by Adm . Bobby R. Inman , then deputy director of Central Intelligence , who warned a scientific meeting that a " hemorrhage of the country ' s technology " to the Soviet bloc would eventually produce a " tidal wave " of public outrage . High officials of the Defense Department and intelligence agencies soon joined the fray with assertions that the Soviet Union had gained much of its most advanced weaponry by drawing on Western technology and ideas . The Russians were said to use a variety of legal and illegal means , including espionage , theft , bribery , legal purchases , attendance at open scientific meetings , and perusal of the vast amount of unclassified scientific literature. // Top military and intelligence officials called for a crackdown on illegal activities and greater restrictions on legal trade and scientific communication . Many technological products were already under tight restrictions , but emphasis increasingly shifted to the ideas and data that make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information that had to be controlled . And military reviewers pressured scientists who had performed unclassified research under military contract to withdraw papers that were to be presented at open scientific meetings. // Alarmed scientific and academic leaders protested . A National Academy of Sciences panel , headed by Dale R. Corson , president emeritus of Cornell Univertsity , in a report issued Sept. 30 , 1982 , urged that restrictions on disseminating unclassified scientific ideas be sharply limited to only a few " gray areas . " Ever since , a struggle has been under way in Federal agencies and Congressional committees between proponents of a tough a crackdown and advocates of openness , who want a highly selective effort that will restrict American science and industry as little as possible. // For Stiffer Curbs // The chief argument for restricting the dissemination of knowledge or high technology to the Soviet bloc is that the most advanced information in such fields as microelectronics , computers and material science might be of immense value to Soviet military scientists . Intelligence officials contend Soviet missile accuracy was improved by legal purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guidance and radar systems and many weapons by legal and illegal acquisitions of Western technical data . Such acquisitions , they say , allow the Soviet Union to overcome technical difficulties that might otherwise slow their efforts to develop new weaponry . Intelligence officials say the Russians are putting immense effort into industrial and scientific espionage. // The leakage of sensitive information is increasingly difficult to stop , military officials say , because weapons have become more and more dependent on technologies developed in the civilian sector . There is a wide range of " dual use " technologies , including the tiny microchips used in electronics circuits , lasers and computers , which are important not only for civilian products and trade but for military uses as well . Thus even civilian scientists who do not consider their work related to military needs may produce information of value to other countries. // The loss of this information to potential enemies could be catastrophic , military officials warn . Mr. Weinberger noted that the United States depends on its technological superiority to counterbalance the greater number of weapons and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country is still ahead technically , he said , the transfer of technical data and products through legal and illegal means is causing an " erosion of our technological lead. " // Against Stiffer Curbs // The chief argument for keeping scientific communication and technical trade as open as possible is that such openness enables both our scientists and our economy to outperform the Soviet Union . Scientific and industrial leaders fear overly restrictive rules would do more harm to the United States than to the Soviet bloc. // As Frank Press , president of the National Academy of Sciences , has said , American scientific superiority " depends upon the open exchange of ideas " among scientists at formal and informal meetings , and in professional journals . The academy ' s Corson panel concluded that a strategy of " security by secrecy " had a major flaw : Restricting scientific communication would disrupt American science , thus weakening American technological capabilities for military and civilian purposes . The panel called for a strategy of " security by achievement " that emphasizes steps to enhance American science rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of information is as serious a security problem as military officials suggest . Some note that intelligence agencies are unable to cite much evidence that open scientific communication has given the Soviet Union a military advantage . Others contend the Soviet bloc has difficulty assimilating and using Western ideas and technologies. // Industrial leaders , fearful trade in high-technology products may be unduly curbed , argue the United States is seldom the sole supplier of any advanced technology . Thus restrictions may sometimes deprive American companies of business without harming the Soviet bloc. // The Outlook // There are sharp differences of opinion within both the executive branch and Congress over how harsh the crackdown should be . The House appears more interested in keeping the high-technology trade channels open , the Senate more concerned with restrictions . The Commerce Department seems more worried about keeping American companies competitive in international trade , the Defense Department puts primacy on denying advanced products and information to the Russians . Within the Defense Department , the hardliners appear to have gained the top authority in export matters but military technology leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where it will all end , nobody knows . The issue has aroused such high feelings in the military , industrial and scientific worlds that a compromise outcome appears inevitable. //
