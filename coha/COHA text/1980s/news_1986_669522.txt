I wept and pleaded , but Mama was not to be bent by tears . She said : ' ' I ' m sorry , dear , but your music marks were very poor last month , and if it goes on this way you ' ll fail the exam and Pa will be very displeased . You know that , don ' t you ? ' ' // Oh , truly , I did know Pa ' s displeasure ! He was a loving Papa , but severe , too . He was keen on education and I was being coached by a long-suffering music teacher for the first of the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Academy of England , in pianoforte . My parents desired me one day to become a teacher of language and of music . Both were very enthusiastic linguists and musicians. // // That wasn ' t at all my idea of life . I hated music because it meant missing fun outdoors on half-holidays and missing delightful parties to practice dull scales and arpeggios . So , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately badly to let her know she was bad ! I banged on the wrong keys ; never did I dream that one day I ' d be on my knees thankful to Ma and Pa for making me study music. // The next few years found me practicing unwillingly for the next music exams after Primary : stiff steps to negotiate on the way to the coveted Musical Degree , Open Sesame to Teaching Music . But when I was 14 , the hard matric exam of the University of London loomed ahead ( in our 16th year we had to take it , in 1934 ) , and they all ( that is , my music master , my head-teacher , and my parents ) said the intense study involved in preparing for a difficult music exam was too great a burden for me , and the lessons ceased . Thereafter I , too , was free on half-holidays and had no more Damocles ' sword of music exams hovering over my head. // My musical tastes were certainly not developed at 14 , and I never listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Years passed ; I married , had a family , came to Canada . We were living in a far northern isolated community , snowed in half the year , far from cultural amenities . No library , nothing . Winters were very long , evenings unbearably so : Without our little battery radio we ' d have been lost indeed . It was our main contact with the great outside world of civilization and culture . The year was 1944. // It was around that time that I discovered the charms of music . As I sat knitting or mending socks and sheets by the window , watching the falling snow , the strains of soft music floated into my consciousness with a pleasant , comforting effect . I had been hearing a Beethoven quartet . Each afternoon after that from two to four I listened to the music program. - and always with pleasure and with profit to my temper. // I began to have favorites . Schumann ' s piano pieces , his woodland scenes especially , carried me away from the subzero temperatures and ice sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest ; but in a winter mood I ' d listen to Tchaikovsky and the other Russians and see in my mind the vast , snow-clad steppes , hear the troika bells as magnificent horses drew a great sleigh swiftly over the snows , bearing its fur-muffled aristocratic passengers. // Of course , then I yearned to have a piano . I began to save , pennies at a time , for this item which I desired above a washing machine , a refrigerator , a phone , or a car , the other desirable amenities of the 1940s household. // It was 1955 before we had sufficient funds saved to buy a used piano ; and it was a great day when the clumsy , old-fashioned instrument was delivered to our door . By that time we were living in a small town not so far north . The piano was the wonder of the neighborhood. // The first week , all the local children seemed to have come to ' ' try it out . ' ' None could play , but they had fun thumping the keys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing bells ' ' or ' ' finger races. ' ' // It had not been tuned , and three notes were mute : However , it was - we decided - better than no piano at all , and for $30 what could you expect ? // Our three children had their first lessons on the ' ' has-been , ' ' and I resumed my studies . My fingers , long unused to playing , were stiff and clumsy , and I had to use the old album of scales and five-finger exercises , once so despised. // In a couple of years we gave the ' ' has-been ' ' to a large family ' round the corner , whose children had been aching to have one of their own , and we acquired another used instrument for $100 . This was passably better . The children and I advanced to pieces by Schumann , Beethoven , Mozart , Bach , and Schubert. // This piano lasted us four years , when we splurged $300 on a secondhand piano that came with a stool . On this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitiously , I purchased a Debussy album because he makes delightful word pictures of rainy morns and parks in all seasons , and I ' ve always loved to see pictures in my mind . Debussy is a musical artist. // Then our family fell on hard times . Every family goes through the vicissitudes of life , so I won ' t go into detail . Our piano was sold ; soon all three children married and departed to live in other parts of the country , and I found myself in a small city apartment where there ' s no room for a piano anyway. // Then , a surprise : For my birthday my children bought me an instrument of compact size that plays organ , piano , harpsichord , and strings at the press of buttons . It is electronic , but that does not trouble me . This morning , with joyful anticipation , I began to take out from an old trunk the hoarded-up piano pieces from years ago . How glad I am that I kept them ! Now memories rush back as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap of years. // Recently I rediscovered that old and beautiful song of Schubert ' ' Du Holder Kunst , ' ' his Ode to the Art of Music . . . which lifts us up far above the cares of daily toil , above this everyday world. // Senior citizen though I am , I had begun to sing it whenever I felt especially happy , such as when a breath of spring in advance of its time wafted to my door with a hint of daffodils and lilies of the valley and hyacinths . I sang this song in the original German . . . a language I have recently taken up as a hobby . Since the walls of my small apartment are soundproof , I can warble away to my heart ' s content. // The one drawback was , I had no accompaniment . But since I have this totally unexpected and wonderful gift , I enter a whole new world of song via buttons . Does a Handel aria demand a harpsichord accompaniment ? I press Button A and , voila , I have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' require rich organ tones ? Button B works the magic . Does a light song by some modern composer require a piano accompaniment ? Button C brings it to my side , and we sing together , my instrument and I , and the hours fly blissfully. // This is a vast improvement on our first tuneless , rickety piano . If this is Progress , I ' m all for it ! How I wish I could fling my arms about the necks of dear old Papa and Mama and thank them from my heart for having , long years ago , insisted that I diligently practice my music ! The children ' s parties . . . they are long gone ; but the beautiful art of music , with its consolation and inspiration . . . that is still with me. // //
