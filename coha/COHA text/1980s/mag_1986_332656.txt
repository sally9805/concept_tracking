Chalk one up for mischievous schoolchildren . Britain 's House of Commons last week struck down a longtime classroom practice : punishment by the cane . The bill abolishing corporal punishment in state-run schools passed by a bare 231 to 230 . An earlier version would have retained caning while allowing parents to exempt their children from the practice , but critics charged that the measure would divide students into " beatables " and " unbeatables . " Last week 's final approval came despite the Education Minister 's warning that " the abolition of corporal punishment would send out wrong signals . " <P> Some Britons agree that caning is inhumane and should not be practiced . This position was emphasized on the day of the vote by a London Standard photo of Schoolboy Barry Tavner , 13 , displaying his beaten bottom after he received five strokes from his headmaster for getting low grades . Ironically , Tavner , who attends a private school , will not be affected by the ban . Others have long advocated allowing teachers to strike . Said a Welsh councilman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane is like sending a boxer into the ring with one hand tied behind his back . "
