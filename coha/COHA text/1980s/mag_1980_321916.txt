Still a nuclear mystery <P> On Sept. 22 , 1979 , a U.S. intelligence satellite , passing over a remote expanse of ocean between South Africa and Antarctica , detected an intense double burst of light in the atmosphere lasting less than a second . After a month of preliminary study , the U.S. announced that it had " an indication " that a " low-yield nuclear explosion " had taken place . The big question : Who had set off whatever went off ? <P> The most plausible culprit was initially thought to be South Africa . Pretoria denied the charge , as well as a subsequent rumor that the South Africans had been testing a tactical weapon for their fleet of Israeli-designed missile boats . Last week CBS News reported another possibility : the light burst had been caused by an Israeli nuclear test conducted with the " help and cooperation " of South Africa . The report , which was based on an unpublished book by two Israeli former journalists , was immediately dismissed by Jerusalem as " complete nonsense " and by Pretoria as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either way-and had not ruled out the possibility that the light burst had been caused by some kind of natural phenomenon . <P> Israel and South Africa do cooperate on certain military matters , perhaps including nuclear ones . But in this case , the denials from Jerusalem made sense . For one thing , Israel is capable of conducting its own nuclear tests in the Negev desert without South African help . For another , Israel 's primary nuclear need would be for relatively small , " clean " weapons that could be tested underground within Israel 's borders-and , indeed , probably have been .
