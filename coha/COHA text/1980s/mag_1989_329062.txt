First there are the blond-haired good looks : striking but somehow wholesome , more high school prom queen than Hollywood glamour puss . Then there 's the rich , honeyed voice : husky and authoritative , but free of the severe tone affected by some females in TV news . As a reader of the news , she is masterly : businesslike but warm , her eyes now wide with the drama of the day , now crinkling ever so slightly with concern . Diane Sawyer does n't just deliver the news , she performs it . <P> But there 's more than mere show-biz flair here . Sawyer is a fully credentialed reporter who covered Three Mile Island and the Iran hostage crisis . Later she demonstrated smarts and interviewing skills as co-anchor of the CBS Morning News . As a member of the formidable 60 Minutes team since 1984 , she has traveled from the garbage mounds of Cairo to the heart of the AIDS plague in Uganda , profiled the likes of Corazon Aquino and James Michener , and given then candidate George Bush perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never seemed an indispensable cog in the powerful engine that is 60 Minutes , she was no Tinkertoy either . <P> Have a conversation with Sawyer , and you can not help coming away impressed . Intelligent , articulate , polished  --  and a bit calculated . ( She calls a reporter at home to amend her earlier list of favorite reading : add Doctorow 's Billy Bathgate and Mann 's Tonio Kroger to a shelf that already features Flaubert , Henry James and John Fowles . ) In earnest , carefully molded sentences , she strives to dispel the notion that she is strictly a TV creation . " I really love what you learn every day in the business , " she says . " I love the breathtaking way we walk into people 's lives and ask them anything we want and then leave . For a moment you have available to you the whole universe of a person 's life  --  the pain and the suffering and the joy and the struggle . You can learn from it and take it with you , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I like to do . " <P> Is it any wonder that Sawyer , at 43 , is the hottest newswoman in television ? The sort of star news executives battle over , make promises to , open their wallets for ? Last February , after more than ten years at CBS , she was hired away by ABC for a reported $1.6 million a year . The primary lure : the chance to join Sam Donaldson as co-anchor of Prime Time Live , the new weekly show that will debut this Thursday at 10 p.m . EDT . In addition , ABC dangled occasional fill-in anchor duty on World News Tonight and Nightline . The prospect of losing Sawyer so rattled CBS 's bigwigs that they virtually handed her a blank check in an effort to keep her ; then , when she was irretrievably gone , they ran out and hired another high-priced star , NBC 's Connie Chung , to fill the gap and save some face .                   @ @
