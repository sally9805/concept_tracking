Seoul lies only 25 miles from North Korea and a tense demilitarized zone . To ensure that it will be a peaceful playground for the world ' s athletes , a huge security force is in place . Even United States ships are reportedly at the ready to discourage disruptive activities. // Though such precautions are a fact of current Olympic life , the greatest force for harmony should be the sense of global participation . For the first time since 1972 , practically every nation is showing up , which means that the level of athletic competition could reach a new high. // // In 1976 , many African nations stayed away from Montreal in protest over the presence of New Zealand , which maintained athletic ties to South Africa . In 1980 , the United States led a Western boycott of the Moscow Olympics following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . And in 1984 , the Soviets and most of their Eastern bloc allies returned the favor , citing reservations about security in Los Angeles as their reason for staying home. // The challenges involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , scared off most would-be bidders . Eventually , only Seoul and Nagoya , Japan , sought the ' 88 Games . Now Seoul will be host at a time of renewed enthusiasm for what the Olympics are and can be. // With three key communist players ( the Soviet Union , East Germany , and China ) eager to take part , the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee ( SLOOC ) had the needed leverage to withstand communist North Korea ' s far-fetched demands to be an equal partner. // North Koreans will be no-shows // Many negotiated compromises were attempted , including a plan to let the North Koreans hold five events , but North Korea ultimately rejected all of them . Though the door remains open , the North Koreans will be no-shows , as will six other nations with membership in the Olympic community - Cuba , Nicaragua , Ethiopia , Madagascar , the Seychelles , and Albania . Of these , only Cuba was expected to be a contender for medals. // The list of acceptances , however , is so extensive that an atlas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the opening parade of nations , which will include countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe , with little-known nations such as Chad , Rwanda , and San Marino sandwiched in between. // Both Iran and Iraq will participate in what the organizers have billed as the Olympics of ' ' Harmony and Progress , ' ' and which carry a $3 billion price tag . Despite the latest cease-fire between these adversaries on the battlefield , the teams will be quartered on opposite sides of the Olympic Village. // If friendships blossom , that would be progress . Whether other developments at these Games will be seen as progress is uncertain. // Tennis the focus of debate on amateurism // The issues of what defines an amateur athlete , for example , could engender much debate over the next 16 days . Much of it will focus on tennis , one of 23 medal sports on the agenda . To some , the return of tennis to the Olympics for the first time since 1924 is viewed as a daring move toward an open Olympics , in which the distinctions between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , when tennis was a nonmedal , demonstration sport , any player aged 20 or under was eligible . This time even the age restriction has been lifted , and many of the game ' s well-established , well-heeled stars have signed up , including West Germany ' s Grand Slam winner , Steffi Graf , and America ' s Chris Evert. // The rules require a modest financial sacrifice in the form of a short suspension of endorsement income , but that ' s a minor point that only gives tennis the appearance of belonging with such unmonied sports as field hockey , team handball , and water polo. // Nevertheless , if money was once a dirty word in Olympic circles , it now is almost fashionable . Even the Soviet Union has gone public with a plan of cash incentives , with $19 , 000 rewarded for winning a gold medal , $8 , 000 for a silver , and $4 , 700 for a bronze. // Looking to coax its own athletes to new performance heights , South Korea is reportedly dangling some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 and each member of the soccer team would win $69 , 500 for a first-place finish . Lifetime pensions have also been mentioned as goads for South Korean athletes , many of whom have undergone grueling training in a secluded training camp. // As only the second city in a developing country to put on this quadrennial sports spectacle ( Mexico City in 1968 being the other ) , Seoul would obviously like to make a statement about the strides being made in all facets of South Korean society. // Signs of this were evident at Los Angeles in 1984 , when the South Koreans turned in their strongest Olympic showing to date , finishing 10th in the final tally with 19 medals . At the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul , they trailed only China in medals , slipping ahead of Japan. // This time the 480-member South Korean team has its best chances in judo , wrestling , archery , boxing , taekwondo , and table tennis . Taekwondo ( pronounced tye-kwahn-doe ) , a martial art that is practiced extensively here , is a nonmedal demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television coverage in the US , reportedly expects that table tennis ( known in America ' s basement rec rooms as Ping-Pong ) may be the surprising viewing treat of the Games . The game is played with incredible speed and power by world-class players. // NBC is shelling out $300 million for the US TV rights , a bargain considering the $309 million that rival ABC spent to telecast 90 hours of last February ' s Calgary Winter Games , which were smaller in scope and had far less variety. // The dates of these Olympics - from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2 - hardly fit what many inaccurately call the ' ' Summer Olympics . ' ' There are the Olympics and the Olympic Winter Games , so Seoul never felt beholden to the calendar , only to 30 years of meteorological reports that indicated the autumn dry season offered the best conditions for the outdoor sports. // These range from equestrian events and archery to soccer , cycling , and athletics , as track and field is known internationally . A majority of sports , however , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnastics , all the way to the demonstration sports of badminton and bowling. // Whatever the sport , spectators will surely spend some of their time being impressed with the magnificently designed new stadiums and arenas Seoul has built . Whereas Los Angeles made extensive use of existing facilities , Seoul has built virtually everything from scratch , giving the structures clumped at the two major sites - Olympic Park and the Seoul Sports Complex - a fresh-from-the-box quality. // The decathlon : ultimate test of athleticism // As at most Olympics , much attention will be focused on the track-and-field events held in the main stadium , which have their roots in the ancient Games . Among them , the decathlon remains the ultimate all-around test of athleticism . Britain ' s extroverted Daley Thompson will be out to make history in this two-day , 10-event test , as he seeks to become the first person to win a third Olympic decathlon . An abundance of other terrific athletes will bring tremendous excitement to the track , including Britain ' s current 1 , 500-meter star , Steve Cram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a potential gold medalist in both the 800 and 1 , 500 , which he is running this time after winning the 5 , 000 in Los Angeles four years ago. // Two other prominent members of the 1984 British team will be absent . Zola Budd , in the midst of continuing controversy surrounding her distance running , returned earlier this year to her native South Africa , where she has enrolled in a university and become engaged . And Sebastian Coe , winner of the 1 , 500 at Moscow in 1980 and again at Los Angeles in 1984 , simply failed to qualify for the British team. // Juan Antonio Samaranch , the president of the International Olympic Committee , couldn ' t perceive of the Games without the defending two-time gold medalist in one of the traditional showcase events , and tried to encourage special consideration for him . British officials rejected making him a ' ' wild card , ' ' however , and Samaranch didn ' t pursue the matter. // The United States is loaded with stars . Carl Lewis , who equaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals in 1984 , will try for an unprecedented repeat , with Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson , a fierce rival , hoping to waylay the bid . Edwin Moses , virtually unbeatable in the 400 meters during the past decade , will attempt to capture the event he won in 1976 and again in 1984 . Mary Decker Slaney , whose ' 84 Olympics ended in tears after a collision with Zola Budd kept her from completing the 3 , 000 meters , will battle the Soviets for the Olympic medal that has eluded her throughout a brilliant career. // Other Americans expected to grab the spotlight are Jackie Joyner-Kersee , her sister-in-law , Florence Griffith Joyner , and Butch Reynolds. // Kersee should win the women ' s heptathlon , the seven-event counterpart to the men ' s decathlon , and battle East Germany ' s Heike Drechsler and the Soviet Union ' s Galina Chistyakova in the long jump , where all three have held or shared the world outdoor record in recent years . Joyner and Reynolds have been the summer ' s most notable record breakers. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avant-garde running outfit of her own design . Reynolds shattered the 400-meter world record that Lee Evans had put in the books at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. // Setting records usually takes a back seat to winning medals at the Olympics , so unless the conditions are absolutely perfect , most athletes will concentrate on beating the competition , not pushing out the envelope. // One of the largest medal totals by any single athlete could occur in swimming , where American Matt Biondi , known as ' ' El Torpedo ' ' in Europe , could match Mark Spitz ' s record seven gold medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics. // Janet Evans , the mighty mite of the US women ' s team , will see if she can hold off a tidal wave of victories expected from the powerful East German squad . Though 5 ft. , 5 in. and only 105 pounds , Evans could tower over some of the would-be Nadias and Mary Lous who will be tumbling their way into public ' s heart at the gymnastics arena . These demitasse dynamos are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this year it may be back around to Romania ' s turn , with 15-year-old Aurelia Dobre , the all-around world champion , and teammate Daniela Silivas among the favorites. // On the men ' s side , spectators will find the strength and agility of Soviet Dmitri Bilozerchev a feast for the eyes , and awe-inspiring , given the recovery he had to make from a serious auto accident. // Just about everywhere one turns there will be athletes and rivalries of interest . In archery , 14-year-old Denise Parker of Utah is a US hopeful , while in yachting , Denmark ' s 60-year-old Paul Elvstrom , a four-time gold medalist , can help show others the ropes , especially daughter Trine , his crew in the Tornado-class races. // In synchronized swimming , defending champion Tracie Ruiz-Conforto of the US has come out of retirement to match aquatic maneuvers with Canada ' s Carolyn Waldo. // American Greg Louganis , perhaps history ' s greatest diver , will try to defend the two gold medals he won in Los Angeles against a group of Chinese aerialists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to harvest medals in the distance events and perhaps hint at some of the potential for a third-world emergence. // The basketball competition , in which the Americans are favored , could provide the first US-USSR matchup since the still-controversial last-minute Soviet victory in Munich 16 years ago. // The potential for intriguing new Olympic chapters goes on and on . The typing fingers and golden throats of some 11 , 500 print and broadcast journalists are poised to record the moments . Now it ' s simply a matter of unleashing 9 , 300 competitors before the world ' s eager eyes. // //
