Limited Inc. said it will ask Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. shareholders to unseat the company ' s board , following opposition from the concern to Limited ' s acquisition offer . Limited , a Columbus , Ohio-based retailer , last week initiated a surprise $1. 1 billion tender offer for Carter Hawley Hale , a Los Angeles-based department store chain . In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday , Limited said it will solicit written consents from Carter Hawley Hale shareholders to remove the board and authorize a meeting to elect a new board . The company said it would begin the solicitation in about a week , following clearance from the commission . However , it said it wouldn ' t carry through with the process if Carter Hawley Hale agrees to its merger proposal , " or approves an alternative acquisition of Carter Hawley Hale which is more favorable to shareholders " than Limited ' s offer . Carter Hawley Hale officials haven ' t formally responded to the company ' s merger proposal , but they did send a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limited ' s offer on or before next Tuesday . The company has filed a civil suit against Limited , charging it with antitrust violations and arguing that it lacks the " financial wherewithal " to complete the proposed acquisition . Limited has labeled the charges " without merit . " " They ' re trying to put the squeeze play on , " said Joseph H. Flom , an anti-takeover lawyer hired by Carter Hawley Hale and a partner in the firm Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &; Flom . " They ' re trying to prevent the company from adopting any defensive measures . " Mr. Flom refused to say what Carter Hawley ' s response to Limited ' s latest move will be . " I ' m not going to telegraph my punches , " he said . In response to the action by Limited , Carter Hawley Hale said its board would continue to evaluate all of the alternatives available . " Our board won ' t be deterred from acting in what it considers to be the best interests of our shareholders by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Limited said it " has great respect and admiration for the directors and officers of Carter Hawley Hale and doesn ' t really wish to remove the board . " It said it was taking the action " to create an opportunity for Carter Hawley Hale shareholders to make their wishes known . " Limited officials refused to comment further about the move . However , sources close to Limited said that the move is designed to " send a message to the board " and prevent Carter Hawley Hale from taking actions that would " diminish the value of the company so that it isn ' t attractive to a buyer . " Limited officials are concerned about speculation that Carter Hawley Hale might sell some of its more attractive divisions , such as Neiman-Marcus , said sources close to the company . They also mentioned the possibility that Carter Hawley Hale would sell some preferred shares to a friendly buyer who would vote to block a merger . When Limited sends out the solicitation , it plans to include a three-page letter to Carter Hawley Hale shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt " by the department store company ' s resistance to Limited ' s offer , a source familiar with the letter said . Limited ' s move differs from a typical proxy fight primarily in that it doesn ' t offer a specific slate of candidates to oppose the current board , said a lawyer familiar with such moves . However , it is subject to similar SEC review procedures , so it could be 10 days before the company is able to contact Carter Hawley Hale shareholders . A preliminary hearing on Carter Hawley Hale ' s suit against Limited is scheduled Tuesday in Los Angeles , with a full hearing to follow April 24 . The tender offer expires May 1 . In its filings with the SEC yesterday , Limited also said that it has borrowed $500 million of the $850 million available to the company to finance the merger under loan agreements with 22 banks . About $15 million will be used to pay for purchases of Carter Hawley Hale stock in March , when the company bought most of the approximately 700 , 000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
