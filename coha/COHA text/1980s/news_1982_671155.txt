It might have made more sense to discuss with them their ongoing desire for nonmonumental architecture rich with historical and psychological symbolism . Or their feeling that the new crop of postmodernists have abrogated social responsiblity in favor of trivial , neo-classical decoration . Or their new projects : an office building in Baghdad , Iraq ; their first line of furniture for Knoll , scheduled for May 1983. // But for the lion and lioness of modern architecture it was , to paraphrase Mr. Venturi , " almost all right " to sit in their home in Philadelphia on a recent Sunday morning and talk instead about the stenciling on the walls , the placement of furniture. // In the years since the publication of their landmark books , which fervently debunk Mies van der Rohe ' s axiom that " less is more " with their belief that " less is a bore , " the couple ' s polemics have mellowed. // " Our house horrifies most architects who come in , " said Denise Scott Brown in a voice that still resonates with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she and her husband live with their 11-year-old son , Jimmy. // " They think it ' s our grandmother ' s house , " said Mr. Venturi . " Or they think it ' s a joke . Well , if it ' s a joke , it ' s a serious one . " Indeed , it is . The stenciling alone on the walls of the three main ground-floor rooms - the dining room that gracefully opens on to the living room that opens just as gracefully on to the library - would , even to the trained eye , seem a veritable mine field of disparate design influences and symbolism . Add to this the cozily ramshackle furniture culled from diverse periods ( not all of them distinguished ) , the welter of small tables piled with books and objects . Add too the less than pure Art Nouveau architecture of the house itself and the fact that it sits in a cul-de-sac lined with split-level tract homes , and it is easy to see how the house could confound even the most accommodating architectural mind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Finzi/Venturis " as their friends affectionately call them , like it . Built in 1910 by Milton B. Medary , the house is a curious mixture of German Jugendstil , which is the German version of Art Nouveau , and the English Arts and Crafts movement. // " It was commissioned by a young German couple who obviously showed Medary some German interior design books from 1907 , " said Mr. Venturi . " I guess you could say it ' s the last gasp of Art Nouveau bourgeois grandeur . We bought it because we couldn ' t afford to build our own . In Philadephia one can get fine old houses relatively cheap . We liked it enough to build on what was there , so we play a designer game with it . But we do it with some wit because we ' re not 1911 bourgeois . An architect ' s house is a workshop . We started stenciling five years ago to practice decoration. " // In the dining room , there is a whimsical stenciled frieze , applied by junior designers of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have been most influential in Mr. Venturi ' s career : Beethoven , Michelangelo , Aalto , Wright , Palladio , Lutyens and Le Corbusier among them . Below them is a frieze of drawings from a book entitled " An Alphabet , " done in 1898 by the British illustrator William E. Nicholson. // " It is time again for variety and variation , for the use of symbol and decoration , " said Mr. Venturi . " But that can involve enormous dangers . Symbols can alienate , especially if they are too esoteric or rely on purely architectural associations . The postmodernists continually use symbols that are either neo-classical or that only mean something to them . We don ' t use symbols directly , but abstract representations of them so one doesn ' t mind them. " // To that end , the walls of the living room , a room ablaze with a wide variety of furniture styles and color , have been stenciled with a flower pattern that has become their trademark . It is a pattern that they also used , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best Products building. // In the library , with its copper Art Nouveau fireplace cover and its Tiffany lamp , the stenciling has been adapted from Gustav Klimt flowers , Viennese Secessionist trees , Art Nouveau cartouches , all of it bordered with a pop art star pattern. // " It ' s perfectly legitimate to use borders to keep things together , " said Mr. Venturi , " even if they are out of fashion . " The furnishings of the house are equally eclectic , or inclusive . The long table in the dining room once graced the library of a university , while the side chairs were salvaged from the Submarine Grill with graceful Art Nouveau moldings and large expanses of windows , an orange plastic chair by Joe Colombo sits squarely in front of the fireplace next to a copy of a Josef Hoffmann upholstered chair . Facing the fireplace , there is a huge , pre-Art Deco sofa , also from the Traymore , its fabric vibrating with a chevron motif . A few antique Sheraton chairs are scattered throughout . And , by the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm , an almost comic afterthought . There is also a fine Art Nouveau breakfront . " It was one of the few pieces we found that successfully fought the rest of room , " said Mr. Venturi. // But in both the living room and the dining room , the large number of pieces that the couple found at the Traymore ( which they consider one of the greatest buildings of the early 20th century ) is perhaps the best indicator of their desire for hybrid , rather than pure , design , for the kind of clutter that Mr. Venturi unblinkingly calls " richness. " // " The sofa cost $5 , " said Denise Scott Brown . " The black elevator table behind the sofa $20 . The chairs , including the side chairs in the dining room , are from the hotel ' s Submarine Grill . Altogether we bought two truckloads of furniture for about $300 , even before we had a house to put them in . It made perfect sense. " // So does their house . For despite the cacophony of styles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of period and style were the most natural thing in the world. // " We are concerned with three things , " said Mr. Venturi counting on his fingers . " One is complexity . In our pluralist world , nothing should be narrowly modern or narrowly postmodern . Two , there is a need for symbols . And three , architecture and design must vary with the needs of people . Everything can ' t be a white column. " // At that , he walked through the entry of the house , which contains perhaps the most important symbols of the couple ' s sensiblity - a simple wooden framed sofa by Gustav Stickley resting quietly under a poster of Mistinguette. //
