For Federated Department Stores , surrender seemed an imminent and lamentable - fate . After a long , five-week siege , the largest U.S. department-store owner had all but given up hope of fending off a takeover raid from the north by Canadian Developer Robert Campeau , who had offered $6.1 billion , or $68 a share , for the Cincinnati-based retailer . But as happens routinely in romances and rarely in corporate struggles , the whitest knight conceivable appeared last week . The venerable R.H. Macy &; Co. , an all-American name that evokes images of Thanksgiving Day parades and the classic movie Miracle on 34th Street , made a comparable last-minute counterbid for Federated . Corporate rescues , though , are never as certain as chivalric ones . While Federated seized on Macy 's offer , Campeau refused to withdraw from the field . <P> Campeau and Macy 's are vying to form a retail colossus . Federated ( 1987 sales : $11.1 billion ) owns 650 stores , including such lucrative chains as Bloomingdale 's , based in New York City , and San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( 97 stores , 1987 fiscal-year sales : $5.2 billion ) or Manhattan-based Allied Stores ( 286 stores , estimated 1987 sales : $3.5 billion ) , which Campeau Corp . bought in 1986 , the merger would be the largest in retail history . <P> When Campeau made his initial offer for Federated on Jan. 25 , the company 's management was aghast . Since taking over Allied , Campeau has arranged the sale of 16 of the company 's 22 divisions and sent scores of top executives packing ; all told , he eliminated an estimated 4,000 jobs . Federated feared a similar dismemberment at the hands of Campeau , 63 , a self-made French-Canadian tycoon who may be more interested in real estate than in accumulating stores . <P> Enter Macy 's . The 130-year-old company , founded by a former Nantucket whaler , stunned Wall Street by joining the fray . Chairman Edward Finkelstein , a shrewd , 40-year veteran with the company , had taken the firm private in a $3.7 billion leveraged buyout in 1986 . Loaded with debt after that deal , Macy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retail analyst for Argus Research : " It 's the last company you would expect to be out shopping . " <P> To Federated managers , Macy 's entrance made perfect sense . They were reassured by Finkelstein 's retailing record and his interest in keeping Federated 's prime chains . By a unanimous vote , Federated directors accepted Macy 's bid . But stockholders may not follow . Because Macy 's offer involves cash and a future stock swap of Federated shares for shares in the new firm , * the value is unclear . The two bids are believed to be comparable , but Federated stockholders have to decide whether they want a payoff now from Campeau or bet on the fate of Macy's-Federated . <P> Another concern is Macy 's potential antitrust problems . In Atlanta , Macy 's and Rich 's , a Federated chain , control almost all the department-store business . In New York City , Macy 's stores and Federated 's Abraham &; Straus and Bloomingdale 's are the top three operations .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
