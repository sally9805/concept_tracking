For one-quarter of the nation , the honeymoon ( what there was of it ) is now over . Sizing up Ronald Reagan 's first two months in office , 24% disapproved of his performance , according to the latest Gallup poll . That is the biggest negative rating for a newly elected President in 28 years of polling comparable situations . ( Dwight Eisenhower , the first newly elected President to have his popularity tested , had a disapproval rating of 8% shortly after taking office . ) And Reagan 's approval rating , 59% , was the lowest at this early stage of a newly elected Administration in the poll 's history . The latest Harris survey , meanwhile , gives the President a 62% approval rating , 5% lower than Carter 's was in March 1977 . <P> The figures are hardly shocking : the fact that Reagan introduced such a controversial economic program so early caused people to choose sides quickly . Richard Wirthlin , the President 's pollster , says that people are " polarizing " over the plan , with most lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the President has the approval of roughly 65% of the country and the disapproval of only 20% . Do the results worry the White House ? Says Press Secretary James Brady of the polltakers : " These are the same wonderful people who brought you the election that was too close to call . "
