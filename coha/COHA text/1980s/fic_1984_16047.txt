FOOTLOOSE -- PRE-TITLE SEQUENCE : INT . MORSE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY The screen is suffused in white light , a blur . We hear the intermittent sound of objects hitting the floor . The camera slowly focuses and we can make out a lone figure , silhouetted against an entire wall of windows shining with sunlight in the background . We move in closer to discover Ren McCormick standing in front of his locker , his release forms clamped between his teeth . He is digging books out of his locker and dropping them into an open gym bag on the floor . Way in the background , we can barely hear the faint sound of a radio , distorted with volume , pounding out a raucous urban tune . This is the quiet beginning to an eventual urban overture , a cacophony of sounds -- MUSIC , VOICES , MACHINES -- that will swell to a peak and then taper off over the span of these first five sequences . EXT . MORSE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Ren exits the building , a tall , institutional red-brick fortress , built sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with graffiti and the neighborhood ai n't what it used to be . Four youths -- two black , two of indeterminate race --  lounge on the huge bank of stairs , spread out with books , food , and a large stereo radio that plays a funky tune ( which may or may not be the radio heard one scene earlier ) . A large convertible , radio blasting , drives by , spirited by a black dude who is practically wearing his woman on his right arm . For a moment , the two MUSIC sounds clash , then fade away . Ren jumps back , avoiding the barreling convertible , and then crosses to his own car , throws the gym bag in the back seat and gets in . When his door slams , a loud , tidal wave hiss swells up to fill the screen . INT . LINEN PLANT - DUSK A cloud of steam covers the screen . Through the fog we can see Ren , bending over large rolling bins of linen , hauling out huge white sacks of dirty linen and feeding them onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dressed in white uniform pants and a tank-top t-shirt that shows off his body to advantage . C.U . of his face as he sweats his way through the back-breaking slinging . NOTE : This scene should be filmed so as to parallel his eventual work on the Oklahoma farm . The similarities between his work actions here and those he goes through haying should be kept in mind . To his right , a co-worker , a stocky BLACK MAN , in his early thirties , accompanies himself at work by singing , very loudly , some r&amp;b hit --  a cappella . But he supplies the rythmic nuances by slinging the laundry bags to punctuate his lyrics .  --  6  --  INT . PLANT - NIGHT End of the shift . Ren is dressed in his street clothes , his hair slightly stringy with sweat . He 's carrying a few personal items  --  the results of another locker cleaning : a spare pair of boots , some clothes hangers , a heavy coat . He 's exiting through a loading dock area where he encounters a foreman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lounge around , we can see the extended antenna of a portable tv and , though no one seems to be watching it , it drones on in the background -- the Solid Gold dancers doing this week 's countdown of the Top 10 . The sound is buried under the MUSIC made by trucks coming and going , cartloads full of laundry scraping along the concrete and men shouting back and forth to each other . We can see Ren receive a paycheck  --  his last  --  and he shakes the hand of the foreman . Perhaps a word or a phrase of their exchange will stick out for a moment --  " . . . gon na miss you . . . " , " . . . take care of yourself . . . " . He passes a few co-workers  --  mostly blacks  --  who slap him on the back or offer their hands in farewell . He awkwardly juggles the clothes he 's carrying and gives them a blud handshake , full of twists and turns of the wrist . One playfully throws a punch at Ren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so , he spins around and kicks his co-worker in the butt . It 's a farewell without tears . EXT . THE INFERNO DISCO - NIGHT We are looking through the windshield of Ren 's car as he slowly glides by and watches the regular crowd move in and out of the dance club . The MUSIC spills from this club and several others in the neighborhood ; every time the door opens to the INFERNO , the noise level jumps appreciably . This stew of sounds is added to by every car that whisks by , or every dude who passes on the sidewalk swinging a super-charged ghetto blaster . His reverie is shattered by the distorted face of a BUDDY popping into frame , his tongue sticking out sideways in a clownish expression . The BUDDY is with an attractive GIRL  --  They 're both about 18  --  and they go through what we can assume to be a friendly goodbye . The BUDDY shakes Ren 's hand through the window and the GIRL leans in , kisses and hugs him . He smiles shyly under all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRL wave and enter the club . The music fades as he drives off and he reaches down to snap on his car stereo , a last vestige of the days when his folks were comfortably off . The tune is animated rock , an urban ( black ) sound , and provides a montage over the following short sequences .  --  7  --  EXT . ROW HOUSES - NIGHT Ren pulls up and parks in front of a line of 1920 's row houses . . . very Chicago east side . He exits the car and runs up the stairs in front of the house . INT . MCCORMICK APT. - NIGHT Ren swings the door open to reveal his mother Ethel carrying a large , heavy box to the door . He rushes to take the box from her ; except for the pile of boxes at the front door , and a few mismatched pieces of luggage , the apartment is empty . No curtains , no furniture  --  nada . He stacks the box and crosses to a small knick-knack shelf in the corner , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo of Ren , his mother and father , taken perhaps three years earlier . Ren 's father has a party hat on and Ren is making rabbit ears behind his father 's head . He takes the frame down , sticks it under his jacket , under his arm , and sets about carrying his suitcases out . EXT . ROW HOUSES - NIGHT The car trunk slams and we see Ren , bundled up against the late January Chicago winter . He squints around himself , taking one last look at his neighborhood . He moves to the passenger side of the car , which , we can now see , is piled up with boxes and clothes in the back seat . He gets into the car , slams the door , and slumps back against a coat , balled up into a makeshift pillow , as his mother , at the wheel , pulls away from the curb . The camera pulls up and away as the car taillights disappear . OPENING CREDITS OVER :  --  8  --  Section Details 1 EXT . OKLAHOMA COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SCREEN FADES IN on a SHOT of Oklahoma terrain  --  flat as far as the eye can see , with only scrub and an occasional rocky rise obstructing the horizon . Out of the distance comes a pair of headlights , solitary on the major freeway ; the SOUND of a RADIO playing rock music swells with its approach . By the light of the headlights we read a large roadside sign that proclaims : " THE RISEN CHRIST IS KING . BOMONT FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH , REV . SHAW MOORE , PASTOR . " 2 INT . CHUCK 'S CAR - EARLY EVENING ARIEL MOORE is a feisty , good-looking redhead who can be alternately innocent and calculating . She is the daughter of the local minister , Rev. Shaw Moore . CHUCK CRANSTON is a 20-year-old with the heavy-lidded look of a school drop-out , but his lips telegraph the sensuality of a tiger . They pass the town limits sign for Bomont , Oklahoma , and suddenly react . They 've been cuddling but now CHUCK removes his arm from around ARIEL 'S shoulders ; she snaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wipes off all her makeup ; and finally she pulls her dress down over her knees and slides over to the passengers side of the car . It 's all done with the efficiency of a ritual . They assume poses of respectability . 3 EXT . CAR - EARLY EVENING LONG SHOT of the car . 4 EXT . DOWNTOWN BOMONT - EARLY EVENING VARIOUS SHOTS  --  a deserted traffic intersection , empty sidewalks , a lonely town square , a small movie house ( The Coronet ) showing " On Gold n Pond "  --  ESTABLISH this sleepy town . Buildings are shuttered , parking lots are deserted , neon signs flicker , half-working , half-not.  --  9  --  OVER THE MONTAGE we HEAR the swelling of voices  --  ETHEL McCORMICK , a recently widowed , wholesomely attractive woman in her late thirties ; her sister , LULU WARNICKER , a housewife in her mid-thirties ; her husband , WES WARNICKER , an overweight , chain-smoking oil businessman ; and SARAH and AMY WARNICKER , their daughters , ages 7 and 6 .

WARNICKER HOUSE  --  EARLY EVENING A modest , ranch-style home with a small front lawn and a one-car garage . &nbsp; AMYI think I 'm gon na take him a potato . 6 INT . DINING ROOM OF WARNICKER HOUSE  --  EARLY EVENING The family is crowded around the dinner table , passing plates back and forth . Six-year-old Amy , with a baked potato in one hand , is exiting the room . &nbsp; WESAmy , sit down . I 'm sure your cousin 's fine . ( she does ) &nbsp; AMYWhat if he 's starving ? &nbsp; SARAHAmy , you are so lame . Amy turns on Sarah with a drop-dead deadpan . &nbsp; LULUHe 's probably still tired from the church service . &nbsp; ETHELCould be .

DINING ROOM , SHAW MOORE 'S HOUSE - SAME EARLY EVENING An unpretentious house . REV . SHAW MOORE , in his late forties with the salt-and-pepper hair , the good looks and the charisma of a Paul Newman , is sitting at the table , set with mismatched silver and juice glasses filled with iced-tea . Pictures of award-winning church sports teams cover the walls . Shaw is going over his sermon . Bustling around him is his wife , VI , a very attractive woman who has down-played her natural beauty . She 's in her late thirties , and is in terrific shape ; she is the woman behind this man , a constantly supportive , enthusiastic partner , whom he tends to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryerson was sniffling all through your sermon and so she went digging through her purse and came up with a bottle of eyedrops , I could n't believe it  --  and she leaned back and put these eyedrops in her nose . ( she laughs ; no reaction from Shaw ) 8 EXT . SHAW MOORE 'S HOUSE  --  SAME EARLY EVENING Chuck pulls up across the street from the house ; Ariel jumps out of the truck and slams the door . She has a winning style that saves her from being " bratty " ; we always sense that she 's genuinely enjoying herself . &nbsp; CHUCKAm I gon na see you after church ?  --  11  --  &nbsp; ARIEL ( playful ) If you 're there . She runs across the street . 9 INT . DINING ROOM , SHAW MOORE 'S HOUSE - SAME EARLY EVENING &nbsp; VI ( continuing ) And so she was choking and coughing and I was choking from trying to stop laughing . ( pause ) I thought it was funny . ( then , in a deeper voice , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nasty . ( then , in her own voice , apparently chastised ) I 'm sorry . I thought it was funny . ( pause ; she continues to set the table ) &nbsp; SHAW ( distracted , deadpan ) It 's very funny . Vi smiles at Shaw 's feeble effort . The front door SLAMS . Ariel enters , jauntily . Shaw looks up for a moment before returning to his work . &nbsp; ARIELI know . I 'm late . A bunch of us were doing economic homework . Gag . ( she makes an appropriate face ) Ariel passes the table and stops , staring down at a pan of sweet potatoes covered with melted marshmallows . &nbsp; ARIELOh , yecch ! Momma ! What is that ? Daddy , did you see this ? ( shaking a finger ) Momma , I keep telling you . Marshmallows are not a legitimate vegetable .  --  12  --  She kisses Vi and she 's gone from the room . Vi smiles . Shaw does not look up . We HEAR the beginning of Shaw 's sermon from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused . &nbsp; SHAW ( V.O. ) And I can not forget it it . I do n't think any of us can . It 's eight years now . Eight years since the Crosby Bridge accident . Section Details 10 INT . CHURCH - NIGHT A typical , unpretentious community church , full . C.U . of Shaw at first . Then as he continues , the CAMERA PANS the congregation and we SEE all of the characters already introduced . Chuck leans against the back wall of the church ; his father , BURLINGTON CRANSTON , a great tub of a man , sits in the last pew , indicating that he should sit alongside him . Chuck ignores his father 's invitation . We also SEE ANDY BEAMIS , a farmer in his late fifties , with an almost aristocratic bearing . He sits alone , consciously setting himself apart from the community . The way he is shot assures us that he 'll figure into the action later . &nbsp; SHAW ( O.S. ) ( Continuing ) And it 's still a powerful reminder of the devasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &amp; the wrong kinds of music . . . and a twisted sense of values can have on our young folks . 11 ANGLE ON SHAW MOORE strding back and forth across the alter . His delivery is mesmerizing  --  alternately intimate and bombastic . &nbsp; SHAW ( Continuing ) Those nine high school students  --  those children  --  who lost their lives in those two cars were our flesh and blood . Nine lives that could have been saved if we 'd recognized the signals that our children were crying out to us.  --  13  --  12 ANGLE ON ARIEL who is surreptitiously painting her nails , shielded on both sides by girlfriends . &nbsp; SHAW ( continuing ) And they still are . Our children still need our undivided attention , still need our constant love . Cuz growing up is every bit as hard as being born . And no matter how old we get , let 's not forget that we 're all  --  all of us  --  still growing up in our Lord 's eyes . Various answers of " Amen ! " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her nails she answers , " Ole ! " 13 OMITTED Sequence omitted from original script . 14 INT . CHURCH VESTIBULE - NIGHT As Shaw moves through a crowd of parishioners nodding and greeting them as he goes , he is approached by Chuck Cranston , who is slightly self-conscious and careful throughout this exchange . &nbsp; CHUCKEvening , Reverend . &nbsp; SHAW ( nodding , guarded ) Chuck . How 's oil rigging ? &nbsp; CHUCK ( smiling , nodding ) Good . Getting better . &nbsp; SHAWIs your Dad here ? Chuck points over his shoulder , into the crowd ; at this moment , Vi comes up behind Shaw and touches him on the elbow . He understands that this is a summons . &nbsp; SHAWTell your Dad the town council 's meeting Wednesday night this week at my place . Ask him not to miss this one ? &nbsp; CHUCKYeah , okay . I got it .  --  14  --  Shaw goes . Chuck takes a filter cigarette , breaks off the filter , and sticks the frayed end into his mouth . A newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF FRAME and plucks it from his lips . &nbsp; ARIELNow , that was n't so hard , was it ? 15 EXT . CHURCH - NIGHT Shaw and Vi are clustered with Ethel , Lulu and Wes on the gravel parking lot outside the church , under the glow of a yellow arc light . Other parishioners are milling around and the small children are running through the legs of adults . &nbsp; SHAW ( to Ethel ) Well , Ethel , we 're hoping that you 're gon na enjoy yourself in Bomont . &nbsp; ETHELI wanted you to meet my boy . ( over her shoulder ) Ren ? This is my son , Ren . She draws him into frame . He is 17 , thin athletic and sexy . His shyness only makes him all the more attractive , and his laconic manner is almost seductive . The way this is filmed should guarantee Ren an " entrance " . &nbsp; SHAWHow d' you do . My wife , Vivian . &nbsp; VI ( shaking hands ) Call me Vi . &nbsp; REN ( awkward ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the high school ? &nbsp; LULU ( jumping in ) Oh , we took care of all that . &nbsp; SHAWGood , good . . .  --  15  --  From behind Shaw , Ariel sticks her head into the group . &nbsp; ARIELDaddy ? &nbsp; SHAWAriel !

She runs off . &nbsp; SHAW ( shouting after her ) Ariel , remember it 's a school night . C.U . Ren watching her go .

MUSIC CUE #2 : CAR-TRUCK RACE  --  17  --  17 ANGLE ON CHUCK CRANSTON IN HIS TRUCK tape deck going FULL BLAST as he bears down on the car full of girls , HONKING as he nudges them to go faster .

Roger collars him and they walk away from the group ; we can faintly hear Roger talking . &nbsp; ROGERSee , that 's the kind of dangerous thinking that we have got to protect ourselves . . . His voice fades . We may even hear the word troublemaker punctuate the conversation . Vi tries to smooth things over . &nbsp; VIThe Dunbars can get very . . . umm , energetic . . . Cookie ?

HIGHWAY - NIGHT MUSIC CUE : TRUCK-CAR RACE Chuck is still pacing Edna 's car . 21 ANGLE ON THE INSIDE OF THE GIRLS ' CAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like kids , things like " Oh , he 's winning !

And then , to the shocked astonishment of the others , she leans out the window of the car , and reaches for the large rear-view mirror frame that extends from the right side of Chuck 's cab . Edna sees what she is trying to do and freaks , but she does n't dare slow down . Chuck loves this . He negotiates the truck closer to allow Ariel easier access to the truck door . We SEE all this from : 22 VARIOUS ANGLES Inside the truck , looking out ; inside the car , watching Ariel disappear out the window ; from behind the two racing vehicles as Ariel 's body bridges the distance between them . The girls are all crazed with disbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . With Ariel still half-in and half-out of the car , we SEE , over Chuck 's shoulder , the headlights of an approaching truck . Edna sees it too and she goes crazy , yelling at Ariel , turning around in her seat and making grabs for Ariel , screaming , " We 're gon na die ! We 're gon na die ! " and " You wan na end up like your brother , " and pounding on her steering wheel . But Ariel is really incapable of retreat . Rusty yells to Edna that she ca n't slow down , and while Stephanie slides down in her seat to hide from the entire scene , Ariel , hanging onto the mirror frame , swings out of the car and hits the running board of the truck in time for Chuck to swerve in front of Edna 's car and narrowly miss the HONKING six-axle truck that goes barreling past them . Ariel pulls open the truck door , hurls herself into the cab , and falls full length across the seat onto Chuck , kissing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the girls ' car , all of them , except Edna , are again vigorously brushing their hair and chatting excitedly , drowned out by the MUSICAL TRACKS .  --  20  --  Section Details 23 EXT . ROCKET DRIVE-INN - NIGHT A squat brick building that sits behind a double row of drive-in stalls . There are a few speaker poles left standing with miniature jukeboxes that extend into the cars like the ones at drive-in movies . The place has obviously seen better days . Ten cars , or so , are lined up under the harsh fluorescence and the KIDS are sitting on , leaning on or walking around between cars . It 's a party atmosphere . Kids cluster around six or eight video games arranged along one wall which are bleeping and squawking . Chuck Cranston pulls in and takes the first space nearest the kitchen , where a stereo speaker is still in working order on the pole next to his truck . Edna pulls in alongside him and the girls explode out of the car . Edna is furious . &nbsp; EDNA ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost did . &nbsp; EDNAChuck Cranston , you 're crazy ! &nbsp; RUSTYThat 's what you get for sniffing spray starch . &nbsp; STEPHANIEAfter he graduated , they drained his brain .

The MUSIC lasts long enough to weave a spell over the kids . And then it STOPS , abruptly . Everyone turns to see what killed the music . 25 ANGLE ON SHAW MOORE standing beside the cab of Chuck 's truck , his hand on the control knob of the stereo speaker . The kids are immediately sobered by his presence ; two girls hide  --  22  --  cigarettes they 've been smoking ; a guy near the trash cans bends down and deposits some of the garbage that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activity we saw in the first scene of the movie . They 've been bad and they know it . Shaw surveys the scene with a bewilderment that 's both confused and concerned . He starts to say something , but he stops . Instead he reaches through the window of Chuck 's truck and hands Ariel two dollars . &nbsp; SHAWYour mother did n't think you had any money with you . He turns and goes quietly .

HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY Two long , low flat buildings . STUDENTS shuffle between classrooms and between buildings .

The parking lot is gravel ; Ren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a long-sleeved shirt and tie to his first day of school and looks very ill-at-ease . &nbsp; ETHELNo , this is fine .

He sets his jaw and turns to go , pushing his way through a swinging door on the left side of the hall . In doing so , he knocks down BRYAN HEWITT , a normally good-spirited jock . He 's sent flying backwards onto the floor of this relatively deserted stretch of hallway . &nbsp; BRYANShit , mister , where 're you going ? &nbsp; RENWell , I. . . &nbsp; BRYANSunufabich do n't you ever look . . . ? &nbsp; REN ( softly ) I 'm sorry . &nbsp; BRYANYou 're supposed to stay on the right .

Ren and Bryan are talking , passing a barrage of students  --  a boy on crutches , a girl with a bouffante , a pack of beefy boys . Ren is a subject of much scrutiny , and several cold stares . He nods a hello and smiles at a few of the girls who pass by but nobody returns his greeting until : &nbsp; RUSTYHi , Bryan . ( stopping Ren ) That tie was not you . Trust me . Ren is puzzled . He recognizes Ariel . She pauses , looks him up and down and turns to go . He searches for something to say . &nbsp; RENAriel ? ? . . .

We 're suddenly hit with a wall of MUSIC as we MOVE IN on a basketball court in the middle of a recreation park on the outskirts of town . We MOVE PAST Ren 's car , with both front doors open  --  car speakers on the doors are booming out the MUSIC . And Ren is seen pacing the court like a caged animal , punching out time of the drum beat here and there , illustrating a guitar run with a run of his own , becoming part of the band , all the while building to a fluid outburst . He pulls off his t-shirt . Several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between areas of light and shadow . And suddenly , POW ! He becomes a human rocket . . . leaping and twirling and cringing and exploding , bouncing off the chain-like fence like he 's doing all of " West Side Story ' single-handedly . He 's a child of movie and TV choreography and some of his references are readily obvious ( Travolta , Solid Gold , Fred Astaire . ) The scene is CUT between CLOSE-UPS and LONG SHOTS , through chain link fence and from overhead , all of it calculated to emphasize just how spooky it is that this kid is dancing his head off in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. The music builds to a climax and so does Ren . And then it all stops and all we HEAR is the sound of Ren 's heavy breathing as he paces the court . &nbsp; ARIEL ( O.S. ) That was incredible ! ! Ren , shocked , snaps around to see Ariel through the fence . &nbsp; RENJesus Christ ! ! You could kill a man ! !

A signal light above the box flashes red . They work their way around to the rear of the box . Ariel points to the silver surface in front of them and Ren gasps . There , hidden from view , the back wall of the switching box is covered with handwriting  --  neat , orderly , normal-sized handwriting ! Many different pens , different hands , different colored inks have all gone into an enormous mural of messages . Nothing is as large as graffiti scrawl  --  it 's diary-size handwriting .

" and , when he does n't get any response , he dives for her , tackling her and carrying her off the track in the opposite direction .

Ariel looks back over her shoulder , not speaking . &nbsp; RENWha happened ? An uncomfortable silence falls over the car . &nbsp; ARIELOh , you 've heard this one . . . the infamous Crosby Bridge accident ? Ren shakes his head . Ariel tells the following story with a seemingly flip attitude ; it barely hides the strong emotions that the story elicits for her .  --  76  --  Oh , you 're missing out .

A woman in a white slip appears fleetingly at a window and Ren follows Bryan 's gaze in time to see the woman move away from the curtains . &nbsp; REN ( out of breath ) Is that Mrs. Cranston ? &nbsp; BRYANNo , she upped and ran away years ago . That 's Lucy Lee Semple . Answers phones over at the water company .

We see the concentration on his face , the speeding up of his breathing ; and then , as he takes off , leaping the hurdles with consummate grace , we MOVE into a MONTAGE . No dialogue is heard and MUSIC rides over it all . The MONTAGE touches on Ren 's compaigning efforts in various locations  --  e.g. , on The Hill , in the school cafeteria , in front of the hardware store , at the shopping mall  --  and shows Ren politicking  --  sometimes alone , sometimes with Bryan  --  with varying degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids taunt him and his exasperation sometimes becomes evident .

He finds Ariel across the room and their eyes meet . She looks back and forth furtively and then opens the zippered sweatshirt that she 's wearing to reveal a t-shirt underneath , stenciled with " DANCE YOUR ASS OFF . " He laughs at the sight , and she zips up again . Ren locates Bryan who gives him a thumbs up signal . The room is an unfurnished common room with a bulletin board and chalk boards off to one side . Across the front of the room is a table of seven aldermen , all of whom we have met before in Shaw Moore 's living room , except for WALTER DOOLEY , the town 's mayor and a part-time insurance salesman . The others are Mr. Fogerty , Burlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rev. Shaw Moore .  --  106  --  There 's an aura of tension . Half the kids have come to see Ren succeed .

Virginia Hubert is the secretary for the group . &nbsp; VIRGINIA ( reading in a flat voice ) . . . and so the price of a dog license will go from three-fifty to four-fifty . A licensed pet is a happy one . ( looking up from her notes ) And that takes care of old business , Burlington . BURLINGTON Thank you , Virginia .

I want to move , on behalf of most of the senior class of Bomont High School that the , unh , law against public dancing within the town limits of Bomont be abolished . There 's a silence while the request sinks in . Ren fidgets . Several of the anti-Ren students exchange disgusted looks . The members of the town board and most of those assembled look to Shaw for his reaction . &nbsp; SHAWRen McCormick , is n't it ? &nbsp; RENYessir . &nbsp; SHAW ( slowly ) Ren , even if it was not a law , which it is , I would have a great deal of difficulty endorsing an enterprise that is fraught with as much spiritual peril as this one is. 114 ANGLE ON ARIEL She rolls her eyes . 115 BACK TO SCENE &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lewd behavior that always seem to accompany such an event , the thing that distresses me even more , Ren , is the spiritual corruption .

He gets expansive , confident with the knowledge that he 's got all his votes lined up . &nbsp; SHAW ( continuing ) They are distractions . They can be destructive .  --  108  --  They can be dangerous . That 's been the experience of this and other communities in this state . But I will defer to my fellow council members and , if they find any way to work it out , I will reconsider my opinion . 116 ANGLE ON ARIEL who understands her father 's con. 117 BACK TO SCENE Shaw sits back with a flourish .

Vi claps her on the shoulder and fairly pushes her back into her chair , hissing : &nbsp; VISiddown , Eleanor . Eleanor is too stunned to fight back . All council members look to Shaw . He pauses , nods to Ren . And Ren begins . &nbsp; REN ( nervous , halting ) I just wanted to say a few words about this motion so you wo n't think . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're encouraging destruction or disorder with this idea . ( his eyes are pained , searching ) You might think that because dance is so misunderstood in these parts . Its gotten a reputation that . . .

McCormick , there 's hardly a need to explain to us what dancing is all abo . . . &nbsp; REN ( looking up , cutting him off ) I 'd like to finish , please ? Burlington is stung ; he looks to Shaw , who , by his silence , also silences Burlington . &nbsp; RENYou see , from the oldest times , people danced for a number of reasons  --  they danced in prayer , or so their crops would be plentiful or so their hunt would be good .  --  110  --  122 ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE OF CLASSMATES AND ADULTS watching , puzzled , as Ren gets his motor going . 123 BACK TO SCENE &nbsp; REN ( continuing ) They danced to stay physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they danced to celebrate . And that 's the dancing we 're talking about . He 's really getting going and the effect is hypnotic . &nbsp; REN ( continuing ) Dancing is celebration ! It cleans out the body and the spirit , and energy that might turn destructive suddenly becomes an expression of joy and happiness . For what ? For the fact that spring is here , hunh ? He looks around to his " congregation " ; he notices that Ethel has joined the crowd at the back of the room and he takes renewed energy from that fact . His rhetorical question gets a few reflexive nods from the crowd . &nbsp; REN ( continuing ) . . . or because we 're graduating . . . hunh ? More nods , even from the opposition forces now . &nbsp; REN ( continuing ) Because we 're happy to be together , and because we are grateful to be alive ! ! ! And has n't it always been like this ?

She checks behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio on .  --  125  --  Suddenly we 're overwhelmed with SOUND  --  powerful , exciting . It provides the background for the following scenes , as it shifts from a slow , ballad feel to up-tempo rhythm and back to the ballad section . 145 EXT . FIELDS - DAY Bryan and Ren are in the dried-out bed of an irrigation canal . It 's a twenty-feet-wide strip of concrete , sunken about eight feet below the level of the fields that surround it . Ren is wearing a Walkman ( portable cassette player ) strapped to his waist and both boys are wearing headphones connected to the machine ; the earphone cords limit the distance either boy can move from the other . When the MONTAGE switches to this setting , as it will several times , the MUSIC will always DROP OUT and be HEARD only faintly . If one boy removes his headphones the MUSIC volume will INCREASE a fraction . Ren is showing Bryan a few dance steps . Bryan follows awkwardly , tied to Ren by the umbilicus of the earphone cord . 146 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRLS are dancing with each other in front of a floor-length mirror , stepping on each other 's toes and correcting each other 's moves . 147 INT . A FAMILY 'S GARAGE - DAY One BOY , curly hair and freckles , is polishing a pair of boots that have n't been polished since the day they were bought . 147A EXT . FIELDS - DAY Ren and Bryan again . They shuffle and strut , and finally they try a spin . This tangles them hopelessly and Ren looks like he might give up . Bryan repositions the headphones , determinedly . &nbsp; BRYANI 'll get it . I 'll get it . 148 INT . ANDY BEAMIS ' BARN - DAY Ren , at the tip-top of the barn 's beams , gives a signal to another student on the floor  --  Woody ?  --  who throws a switch and the loft of the barn is outlined in a sparkling display of runner lights ; a dazzling effect because of the setting and because of its unexpectedness . Another shot reveals Chuck Cranston watching the preparations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126  --  149 EXT . FIELDS - DAY Ren and Bryan for the last time . Bryan seems like he 's onto . . . something . Ren stands back in amazement as Bryan executes a few choice moves , ending in a gim me five slap with Ren . The moment is faintly reminiscent of the exchanges between Ren and his co-workers in the pre-title sequence . 150 EXT . FIELDS - NIGHT A group of STUDENTS are silhouetted by a bonfire as they dance a mad conga line against the moonless sky . Montage ends . Section Details 151 EXT . SHAW MOORE 'S HOUSE - NIGHT Ariel is waiting on the front porch for Ren to pick her up , looking stunning in something very feminine and wearing those red boots . The door opens behind her and she starts . It 's Vi , carrying something out onto the porch in the semi-darkness . &nbsp; VII was afraid you 'd be gone . &nbsp; ARIELNaw . I figured I 'd better just wait out here . &nbsp; VIWell , you ca n't very well have a prom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , and pins it on Ariel . &nbsp; ARIEL ( her eyes welling ) Oh , Momma . . . Momma , it 's beautiful ! You did n't have to . &nbsp; VII did n't . They stop and stare at each other . &nbsp; VI ( continuing ) But do n't go on about it to him because he 'll only deny it . Headlights sweep the front of the house and Ariel waves . She turns to Vi .  --  127  --  &nbsp; ARIELMomma , I got a letter today . From the University of Ohio . . . I left it out for him to read . &nbsp; VI ( nodding ) He read it . Ariel is stunned . Her eyes well up . She looks to the corsage . She picks out one rose . &nbsp; ARIELWhen he 's ready to hear it , tell him thank you ? And give him this ? Vi nods and Ariel runs off the porch to join Ren . Vi watches her go . 152 INT . REN 'S CAR - NIGHT Ariel lets herself in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get you . . . Ren looks her over and begins to laugh . And laugh . Ariel is confused and irritated . &nbsp; ARIELWhat 's the matter with you ? &nbsp; RENI 'm sorry . ( he sobers up ; sincerely ) You 're beautiful . &nbsp; ARIELWhat ? &nbsp; RENI mean it . ( shaking his head , with real warmth ) You  --  are  --  beautiful . She reaches out and touches his cheek .  --  128  --  Section Details 153 INT . BEAMIS ' BARN- NIGHT A pan of the barn reveals that very few kids have shown up . Here and there are a few couples , huddling , talking softly . It 's the awkward moment that comes before any dance gets underway , before a gym becomes a wonderland --  except that only one-third of the senior class is present . A disheartening turnout . Angle on Ren and Ariel behind the stereo equipment set-up at one end of the barn . He looks crestfallen . &nbsp; ARIELWell , we got ta start . There 's probably more coming . Ren vacantly eyes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start ! And she pushes the play button on a cassette machine . MUSIC CUE # 14 : FIRST DANCE IN THE BARN And pow ! ! The music kicks in -- a rythmic dance beat . The few kids present look up , blinking as if they 're looking into a bright light . They are embarrassed , unmoved . Section Details 154 EXT . BARN- NIGHT From across the field , Shaw and Vi are watching . His arms are folded and in his fist he clutches a single red rose . Vi 's hands are buried in the pockets of her wraparound sweater . &nbsp; VIWell , why do n't we take a closer look ? &nbsp; SHAWNo. . . she 'll think I 'm checking up again . &nbsp; ANDY ( o.s . ) Now , you 're the last folks I expected to see here . Shaw and Vi whirl around to find Andy has come up behind them . They laugh nervously . &nbsp; VI AND SHAWGood evening , Andy . &nbsp; ANDYEvening , Reverend , Vi . ( pause ) Reverend , you did a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not sure it was the right thing .  --  129  --  &nbsp; ANDYWell , I think it comes close . And he moves past them toward the barn . Section Details 156 EXT . BACK OF THE BARN - NIGHT Bryan and Rusty are leaving their car when Chuck Cranston and four goons glide up in his truck . It 's clear that these boys have n't come to dance . &nbsp; RUSTYNow , Bryan , you promised . Chuck gets out of the truck , looking crazed . &nbsp; BRYANWhat do you want , Chuck ? &nbsp; CHUCKI got business with your friend McCormick . Chuck moves toward the barn and Bryan blocks his path . &nbsp; BRYAN ( conciliatory ) Hey , Chuck . Coll it . No fights , okay ? I just promised Rusty here . . . And wham ! Chuck slams him across the face . Bryan staggers a bit , looking to Rusty . She bites on her lower lip . Chuck smashes Bryan one more time and the crunch is audible . &nbsp; RUSTY ( to Bryan ) Kill the sonofabitch ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan hoots jubilantly and lunges at Chuck , connects with his chin , and the four goons surround him .  --  130  --  157 INT . BARN -- NIGHT Music continues as Rusty runs into the back of the barn and searches for Ren . She runs to him and , under the music , gesticulates wildly . He rushes out , followed by Ariel , all of this without any dialogue . The other students are left standing around , marking time . The music pounds on . Section Details 158 EXT . FIELD - NIGHT &nbsp; SHAWI think that 's enough . &nbsp; VI ( mesmerized ) Oh , no , just another minute . But he 's already walked off , his head down . Vi stands alone for a few seconds more , then turns to find that she 's alone . She tries to follow him in the dark . &nbsp; VI ( calling ) Shaw ! Shaw ! ( she stops ) Please , Shaw ! ( plaintively ) I 'm afraid of the dark . He stops and turns back to her as she catches up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes are shiny with tears . &nbsp; VIShaw , what is it ? &nbsp; SHAW ( stoic ) I 've lost her . Long pause . Vi reaches out and touches him on the arm . &nbsp; VI ( gently ) Just the two of us , hunh ? Again . Section Details 159 EXT . BARN - NIGHT Music spills from the barn . Bryan is picking himself up when another fist connects and he 's decked again . Five guys stand in a semi-circle around him as Ren runs up . &nbsp; RENCHUCK !  --  131  --  Chuck turns . WHAM ! He gets it right in the kisser . He falls and looks up at Ren . &nbsp; RENYou 're a fuckin ' hero when it 's five on one . &nbsp; CHUCK ( getting up ) Well , it 's Mister Dance Fever . NOTE : Throughout the following fight we are vaguely aware of headlights sweeping the scene and more bodies joining the crowd of onlookers . The spill of MUSIC from the barn provides a backdrop for the confrontation . Chuck lunges at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists and his knee up to connect with Chuck 's chin and stomach . Chuck is wrenched upright , his eyes roll back in his head and he drops like a brick . &nbsp; RUSTYREN ! ! He turns in time to see one of the goons moving in on him with a length of pipe . He handles himself as Bryan takes on two other guys . And , although it 's now stacked 4 to 2 , Ren pulls out all stops , fighting in a way that borrows heavily from king-fu -- kick school of fighting , a talent he might have developed in the playgrounds of Chicago . Bryan is strictly fists -- bar-room brawling at its best . Then one last guy scrambles to his feet and tries to run but Bryan , the high-jumper , with one flying leap , kicks him on the back of the head and levels him . A cheer goes up from the sizable crowd that has assembled during all of this . Ren looks around , blinking in astonishment , groggy , to find himself surrounded by his senior classmates . They yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps Bryan up --  like he did the first time they met --  and the two congratulate each other . Ariel and Rusty join in . &nbsp; RUSTYI was so scared you guys were gon na , like , really fight . They all link arms and start back to the barn with the crowd following them . The MUSIC shifts -- from the driving beat that has propelled this whole fight sequence -- into a ballad . MUSIC CUE #17 : BALLAD IN THE BARN pp. 91-112 &nbsp; pp. 132-133 160 EXT . FIELD - NIGHT Shaw is now standing with his back against their car , Vi is leaning against his chest , holding onto him around the waist . His arms are behind him , braced against the car . The spill of MUSIC is heard . &nbsp; VIDid n't you know ? Oh , I 'm terrified of the dark --  all those years I 've waited for you in the dark --  lying in bed and waiting for you to finish patching up someone else 's lives , holding someone else 's hand , and I 'd be lying there , waiting for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally there , miles across the bed , I fear the dark and I fear the distance . Shaw embraces her . &nbsp; SHAWDon't. 161 INT . BEAMIS ' BARN - NIGHT The ballad has created a whole new mood in the barn . The kids who have filled the place have to touch each other and dance close . There are quick cuts to guys on the sidelines , asking girls for the dance in their perfunctory way . The girls are clustered in groups , pointing and hiding their smiles . Ren surveys the activity on the dance floor . Off to one side he sees Andy Beamis enter the barn , approach his mother , who 's been chaperoning , and ask Ethel to dance . She demurely accepts . 162 EXT . FIELD - NIGHT The MUSIC of the ballad is filtering out of the barn as Shaw and Vi stand against each other , pressed up against the car in the field . Shaw 's face relaxes and he lowers his lips to the top of her head and kisses her . &nbsp; SHAW ( softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , because of the moon hanging like a wafer over their heads , because of the music -- for a lot of reasons -- they begin to sway very , very gently . Almost imperceptibly . Holding onto each other . &nbsp; VI ( in a whisper ) Shaw ?  --  133  --  &nbsp; SHAWYeah . A beat . &nbsp; VIWe 're almost dancing . The CAMERA PULLS BACK from the two of them lost in the field , with the barn in the background flashing and shimmering . 163 INT . BARN - NIGHT Bryan and Rusty are dancing slowly , Rusty holding Bryan up as they tenderly move across the floor . Ren holds up his hands to Ariel  --  she fits neatly into his arms , and he sweeps her out onto the floor , burying his face in her red hair . And the music , until now very ballad-like , suddenly accelerates into a hard driving , electric pulse . The kids fill the dance floor , careening and strutting , posing and spinning . They explode , they fly ! ! C.U . of Ren and Ariel dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ariel and , as she whips around , her hair flying out and FILLING THE SCREEN , we FREEZE . The song CONTINUES as CREDITS ROLL . THE END pp. 113-131 &nbsp;
