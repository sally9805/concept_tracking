FRANZ KAFKA : THE COMPLETE STORIES ; Schocken ; 486 pages ; $22.50 <P> Anguish was not Franz Kafka 's central obsession . It was his only one : the misery of illness , the descending sorrows of guilt , estrangement and despair . Torment stains every page of his fiction , and his autobiographical writings are so clotted with disorders that one collection states : " Frequent references to insomnia and headache have not been included in the index . " <P> Not all the sickness was psychosomatic . Kafka succumbed to tuberculosis in 1924 at the age of 40 . But he regarded even real disease with paranoid suspicion : " My brain and my lungs must have conspired in secret . " He believed in " only one illness , and medicine hunts it blindly like a beast through unending forests . " The malady was life itself . <P> Given this nihilism , this self-loathing that seems the dark side of narcissism , why does Kafka remain , 100 years after his birth , one of the authentic voices of the age ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Complete Stories . His tales , some no more than a paragraph long , have forced their way into the modern consciousness . In The Metamorphosis , Gregor Samsa turns into an insect ; in A Hunger Artist , a professional faster starves himself to death " because I could n't find the food I liked . If I had found it , believe me , I should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else . " In In the Penal Colony , needles write the excruciating message BE JUST on the back of a condemned man . In Investigations of a Dog , the canine narrator can not admit that his species is subject to the whim and will of a larger power . <P> These works , and the other 74 tales in the collection , have become secular cabala , subject to endless sifting and interpretation . Hermann Hesse judged Kafka 's works " an urgent formulation of the question of religious existence . " W.H. Auden called Kafka " the author who comes nearest to bearing the same kind of relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to theirs . " Andr Gide did not know what to admire most , " the naturalistic presentation of an imaginary world , or the daring turn to the mysterious . " But Edmund Wilson was not ready to admire either : " Kafka is being wildly overdone , " he grumbled . " What he has left us is the half-expressed gasp of a self-doubting soul trampled under . " <P> Two generations later , all of these opinions can still find adherents . Kafka 's work is so specific on the surface , and so cryptic underneath , that it can serve any interpreter . His admirers and detractors " agree on only one point : Kafka " was the neurotic artist personified . He despised his work as an insurance clerk but would not quit . He shied from sentiment as a " fatness of feeling " and recoiled from sex : " Coitus is the punishment for the happiness of being together . " He could write only about what he knew , and what he knew were his dreams . " My talent for portraying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other matters into the background . "
