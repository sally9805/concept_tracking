The framers of the Bill of Rights surely had loftier disputes in mind . But last week a federal judge in Denver invoked the First Amendment guarantee of free speech in ruling that calling someone a " sleaze bag " who " slimed up from the bayou " does not constitute slander . When Football Coach Darrel ( " Mouse " ) Davis used those words to describe Sports Agent J. Harrison Henderson III , he was free to express his opinion , according to Judge Jim Carrigan . The judge dismissed a suit for at least $12 million in damages that Henderson had filed against Davis and two newspapers that printed the remark . <P> " Mere name-calling is not actionable as a matter of law , " argued the defense attorneys . Indeed , the judge suggested , it can be refreshing . " Creativity in the art of abusive epithet has all but disappeared , " he stated . " It is all too rare today to hear the clear , clean ring of a really original insult . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
