A statewide referendum in Oregon in November threatens to shut down an operating nuclear power plant . The proposition , which polls suggest may be approved , is the latest indication of Americans ' increased concern over nuclear safety following the Chernobyl disaster . Measure 14 , as the proposition is known , would require Portland General Electric Co. ' s Trojan plant to shut down by Dec. 4 and stay mothballed until a permanent dump site is licensed for the nuclear waste produced by the plant , which is north of Portland . As at other U.S. nuclear plants , Trojan ' s waste is stored at the reactor site because Congress has never designated any dump sites for expended reactor fuel . Barbara Roberts , Oregon ' s secretary of state , says the referendum reflects peoples ' concern over Chernobyl , noting that Hanford , Ore. , is the site of a similar facility that is operated by the Energy Department . She adds that more than 80 , 000 voters had to sign petitions in order to get Measure 14 on the ballot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation plans for the Seabrook 1 plant , a move that may prevent the licensing of the plant , which is in Seabrook , N.H. Gov . Dukakis said he rejected the plans " based on what I know of Seabrook and Chernobyl . " In Ohio recently , Gov . Richard Celeste cited Chernobyl as the reason why he named a panel to study evacuation plans at the Perry and David-Besse plants , the latter , east of Toledo , the site of a near-catastrophic accident in 1984 . And in Vermont , Gov . Madeleine Kunin has cited Chernobyl as a reason why she wants the right to set nuclear-safety standards for the Brattleboro , Vermont , Yankee plant that are stricter than federal standards . Oregon ' s Measure 14 , although currently ahead in the polls , faces an uncertain political future . To date , a citizens ' group opposed to the measure has raised about $716 , 000 , of which $661 , 000 comes from Portland General Electric . By contrast , two citizens ' groups in favor of the measure have raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , Oregonians are being inundated in the media with messages to vote no . If Measure 14 passes , it still faces an uncertain legal future . A spokesman for Portland General Electric says the utility would challenge its legality , arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that the federal government enjoys a preemptive right to regulate atomic energy aspects of the nuclear power business . However , Ms. Roberts says that in Oregon at least , judges are very reluctant to overturn a voter initiative . In addition , David Schooler , the senior counsel for a House energy subcommittee , said recently that he thinks Congress may ultimately take away the federal government ' s preemptive right . The Portland General Electric spokesman says the utility ' s media efforts aim at showing voters that their votes could cost them Trojan ' s power for years to come . That could be critical , says the utility , if its hydropower resources were affected by a drought . But Ms. Roberts , for one , is unimpressed . " We ' ve had Trojan shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody would get hysterical if it is shut down again , " she says . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
