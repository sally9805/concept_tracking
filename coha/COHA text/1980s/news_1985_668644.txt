In a meeting marked by shouting and name calling , Du Page County board members Tuesday voted 14-9 to support a quarter-cent countywide sales tax . But in securing the board ' s support for legislation pending in Springfield , board Chairman Jack Knuepfer ( R. , Elmhurst ) was forced to pledge that he would not ask board members to impose any part of the county ' s current 12 cents per $100 assessed valuation tax rate for fiscal 1986 . The entire amount was levied for fiscal 1985 . Legislation pending in Springfield would allow the state ' s seven urban counties , the five collar counties and two Downstate counties to impose a quarter-cent sales tax countywide . Currently the county can impose a quarter- cent sales tax only in the unincorporated areas of Du Page , which rapidly are shrinking . If the countywide sales tax were implemented , however , the county ' s maximum property tax rate automatically would be reduced to 9 cents per $100 from 12 cents , according to the legislative proposal . " For 1986 we would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s what I ' m proposing , " Knuepfer told board members as shouts of " liar " punctuated the debate in the board room of Du Page Center in Wheaton . " We could eliminate the entire tax , " he promised . " If we don ' t get this sales tax legislation , there will be substantial cuts in the budget , " Knuepfer warned , pointing to the increasing outlays for the judicial and public safety portions of the county budget . Those two areas , which include the state ' s attorney , public defender , Circuit Court clerk , judges , sheriff and coroner , now cost more than $27 million , or 75 percent of the county budget . " We need a countywide revenue base . Our only countywide base now is the 12-cent real estate tax , and it yields only $8 million , " Knuepfer said . Knuepfer also pledged that he wouldn ' t attempt to lobby behind the scenes after a number of board members announced , " We don ' t trust you . " Jane Spirgel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s contention that the sales tax was needed . The tax would raise $11. 7 million . " We have a potential loss of $5 million due to the decreasing size of the unincorporated area , " she said . " Nowhere has a need been demonstrated for $11. 7 million in sales tax revenue . " " We need to deal with the double taxation issue . My constituents nearly all live in municipalities and already pay for public safety , " she said in voicing opposition to the sales tax plan . She was joined in opposing the sales tax by Frank Urban ( R. , Clarendon Hills ) , who argued that a sales tax by nature is " regressive . " " It falls heaviest on the poor and middle-income people of this county , " he said . " If this bill passes , the sales tax is our only option . " The battle over the sales tax legislation , however , only served as an entree for a general attack by board members for what they said was Knuepfer ' s failure to consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county introduced in the legislature . Judith Crane Ross ( R. , Downers Grove ) charged that Knuepfer ' s end run around the board to the state legislature was another example of his effort to impose on the county an executive-form of government . Ross charged that Knuepfer in 1972 termed the county board a " headless monster in which there are a number of committees running every which way . " She backed up the charge by displaying a newspaper article in which the quotation was contained . If there is a budget shortage , she suggested facetiously that $3. 4 million could be saved by eliminating the county board and allowing Knuepfer to run the county government unrestricted . But Charles Vaughn ( R. , Wheaton ) , going to Knuepfer ' s defense , charged that board member Patricia Trowbridge also had violated board rules by having legislation introduced to allow the county ' s Board of Local Improvements to install storm sewers . Presently , that board can only improve roads . Knuepfer confirmed Vaughn ' s charge . But Trowbridge , calling both Vaughn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t asked State Sen. George " Ray " Hudson to introduce the legislation but only to lobby for the legislation after it had been introduced . Attempting to create sense out of the chaos , board members decided to form a committee to review pending state legislation that would affect the county . CAPTION : PHOTO : ( Jack ) Knuepfer .
