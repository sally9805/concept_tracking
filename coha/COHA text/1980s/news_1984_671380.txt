They also took the series , two games to one , sending the Mets home with four losses in their last six games. // It wasn ' t Gooden ' s worst experience in 15 starts in the big leagues , but it came close . The Houston Astros roughed him for eight runs in one inning May 6 . But tonight , although he struck out six batters in five innings , he was no match for Marty Bystrom and the Phillies , who added to the Mets ' misery by stealing six bases. // " I didn ' t think I threw all that badly , " Gooden said later . " They got some timely hits . But I ' ve bounced back before , and I ' ll do it again. " // " Last week in New York , we took two of three games from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It ' s a long way to go . The main trouble is we can ' t sustain our offense. " // Gooden faced the Phillies with stunning statistics for a rookie : 107 strikeouts in 91 innings , more than Nolan Ryan of the Houston Astros and second only to Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers. // For four innings , he matched zeroes with Bystrom , and that was a pretty neat trick because Bystrom retired the first 12 batters he faced . It was a virtuoso start for Bystrom , who was disabled twice last season and who opened this season in the minor leagues . And , since rejoining the Phillies , he had worked only 50 innings in 10 starts , with an earned-run average of 5. 58. // But no Met reached base against Bystrom until George Foster opened the fifth inning with a single into center field .

He struck out Ron Gardenhire , he got Jose Oquendo on a line drive to third base , and the Mets ' chance was gone. // Then the Phillies went to bat , and tore into the Mets ' prize rookie with five runs and a dazzling display of running the bases. // Gooden , who had allowed two singles and three walks in the first four innings , began by retiring Bystrom on a fly to center . But then came the rookie sprinters at the top of the batting order , Juan Samuel and Jeff Stone , who had reached base a total of 11 times in the first two games of the series. // Samuel popped a soft line drive into left field and hustled it into a double . Then Stone shot a line drive into the gap in right-center and hustled it into a triple , and the Phillies had a run . And , when Von Hayes singled to right , they had two. // Hayes , who had stolen second base in the first inning , promptly stole it again . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes and Schmidt pulled a double steal . That put runners on second and third , and both scored when Tim Corcoran singled to left field. // More trouble followed when Garry Maddox singled to left , and now six consecutive batters had reached base . The string was interrupted when Ozzie Virgil flied out to center . But Ivan DeJesus singled through the left side of the infield , Corcoran crossed and the Phillies had six hits and five runs in one explosive inning. // In reply , the Mets produced a home run by Mookie Wilson in the top of the sixth . But they were still four runs down , with their pitching prodigy back in the clubhouse pondering his first encounter with the defending National League champions. // <> <> Strawberry , Brooks Sidelined // // Strawberry missed his second consecutive game with a bruised left wrist , and Hubie Brooks missed his fourth game with a strained left wrist . Both were expected to return in a day or two . . . . The Mets open a 12- game home stand Thursday night against Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds . . . .

He retired 11 consecutive batters during one stretch . He gave way to Donnie Moore , who retired the last two batters to record his sixth save. // // Cubs 8 , Pirates 7 // CHICAGO ( AP ) - Jody Davis drew a bases-loaded walk off Rod Scurry in the 11th inning to force Ryne Sandberg across the plate with the winning run .

LOUIS ( AP ) - Bill Gullickson retired 14 consecutive batters in one stretch en route to his fourth victory in his last five decisions .
