" The public is never wrong , " proclaimed film pioneer Adolph Zukor , and on such wisdom Hollywood was built . Zukor 's maxim is as sound today as it was when Rodeo Drive was just a furrow in a field , but now it is being challenged by what may be the most offensive idea since Smell-O-Vision : commercials in movie theaters and on videocassettes . <P> The 1987 cassette of Top Gun was the first film to carry a commercial plug ( Diet Pepsi was the sponsor ) , but since then the tapes of a dozen or so other movies have hawked everything from candy bars ( Moonstruck , Dirty Dancing ) to Jeeps ( Platoon ) . Though the just released cassette of Rain Man sells for no less than $89.95 , its distributors , capitalizing on the vintage Buick that is featured in the film , put in an ad for  --  you guessed it  --  Buick . The otherwise splendid new release of The Wizard of Oz starts off with a one-minute Downy commercial . <P> Two companies are even adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlors to car washes ; these ads are sometimes in addition to those already inserted by the studios . With the same kind of self-righteous growl a dog utters when a rival approaches his dinner bowl , Paramount , which started the phenomenon with Top Gun , has brought suit in a federal court in Wichita to stop such Johnny-come-latelies . <P> The gain for the studios is obvious . But what the sponsors hope to achieve is something of a mystery . Procter &; Gamble , the company that makes Downy , will spend $8.5 million to advertise The Wizard of Oz tape . Yet , according to two surveys , at least two-thirds , and perhaps as many as nine-tenths , of all viewers push the fast-forward button when they spot an ad . <P> The trend is not confined to cassettes . Almost one-third of the country 's 24,000 movie screens are also bombarding patrons with commercials . " We are purveyors of entertainment that sells , " says Terry Laughren , president of Screenvision Cinema Network , the largest distributor of theater advertising . <P> But unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office are captives , without a speedup button to zap the obnoxious spots . Many are starting to rebel , and hoots and howls are common when commercials flash onto screens in New York City , where ticket prices run as high as $7.50 . <P> Moviemakers are among the loudest complainers . " Commercials cheapen the medium and put the audience in a bad mood before they see the film , " says director Phil Alden Robinson ( Field of Dreams ) , expressing the overwhelming reaction among producers and directors . A majority of theater owners still agree , refusing to turn their screens into billboards . " Our experience with commercials was very negative , " says Gregory Rutkowski , a vice president of AMC Entertainment , which owns 1,700 screens across the country . " We tested them several times , and our customers told us that they wo n't stand for them . You ca n't underestimate the intelligence of the audience . " To which Zukor would probably say , " I told you so . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
