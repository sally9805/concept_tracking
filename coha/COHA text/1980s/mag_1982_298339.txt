The new cars are here , but where are the customers ? <P> Lee Iacocca , the brash , cigar-chomping chairman of Chrysler Corp. , is an optimist by nature . At the introduction of his company 's 1983 model cars at The Woodlands Inn &; Country Club near Houston last week , however , he could scarcely disguise a sense of frustration . Said Iacocca : " Chrysler is ready to go ; unfortunately the economy is not . There 's a lot of fear out there because there 's a lot of uncertainty about interest rates , currency values and our economic policy . " <P> More and more , such sentiments typify the mood of the U.S. auto industry . After almost four years of slumping sales , soaring layoffs , and losses that at one point reached $5.2 billion , executives of the Big Three automakers ( General Motors , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler ) have grown understandably wary of predicting almost any sort of recovery at all . Ford President Donald Petersen bluntly asserts : " There are no signs whatsoever of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13.4% sales rise during the mid-September period as compared with depressed 1981 levels . But analysts noted that the gain was something of an aberration , coming largely from temporary price promotions to customers . <P> Prospective buyers will see little in the way of radically new models in showrooms this fall . One of the few : Chrysler 's new E Class and Dodge 600 , which are actually artfully stretched versions of the Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries K-cars that were first introduced in 1980 . By and large , the automakers will barrage the public with advertising messages that emphasize value more than innovation . Ford has already cut the sticker price on its subcompact models by $400 . <P> During 1983 , manufacturers hope to make up for lost sales . Ford plans to unveil its first compact front-wheel-drive cars , the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz , along with a new softly rounded , highly aerodynamic Thunderbird . General Motors is readying two sports cars of its own for the market : a revamped Chevrolet Corvette , and a small new two-seater from Pontiac . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get at least something of a boost from the ongoing decline in inflation . The Labor Department announced last week that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of only 3.3% in August , half as much as in July . A drop in gasoline prices contributed to the decline , as did lower food prices . <P> Despite a continuing campaign of price-cutting tactics by Detroit , foreign imports , especially from Japan , keep expanding their share of the American market . Japan has agreed to limit U.S. ship ments to 1.7 million cars this year , but as the domestic U.S. market shrinks , the Japanese share of it grows . By last month , imports had climbed to almost 33% of the U.S. market , an alltime high . <P> Detroit suffers especially from its difficulty in turning a profit on fuel-efficient small cars , the market sector in which foreign competitors are strongest . In the last two years , Ford has sold 600,000 subcompact Escorts , partly by holding prices so low that sales have barely covered costs . To stay competitive , General Motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japan , in which the companies will jointly build small cars at an assembly plant in Fremont , Calif. , that GM closed down early this year .
