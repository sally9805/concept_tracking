A nationwide ' ' state of emergency ' ' was declared at noon . It gave the authorities nearly unlimited powers to censor the press and to search , seize , arrest , and imprison persons deemed a threat to state security . The declaration was made retroactive to midnight , when police had begun detaining hundreds of anti-apartheid activists. // // The immediate catalyst for the move , which was condemned by the Reagan administration and which came in defiance of escalating calls by the West for economic sanctions , is the approach of the June 16 anniversary of Soweto ' s 1976 revolt . That revolt was in many ways different from the current uprising , but many blacks see a connection. // ' ' Our uprising here in 1976 was like a volcano . That is the reason for the white government ' s problems now ! After a volcano , the political landscape can never be the same again , ' ' said one black man Thursday. // The authorities last week issued a ban on meetings commemorating the black uprising during which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by vows from black leaders to go ahead with such meetings. // The government also tried , but failed , to rush through new security legislation giving police broader powers to detain people without trial and to limit reporters ' access to areas of unrest. // The police chief of Soweto said he would use his new state-of-emergency powers to bar reporters from the township on Monday , the anniversary date. // President Pieter W. Botha told a nationwide television audience late yesterday that he had imposed the state of emergency to head off the threat of ' ' large-scale unrest ' ' on the Soweto anniversary and an eventual takeover bid by what he called pro-Moscow ' ' revolutionaries . ' ' Mr. Botha said he was aware that the move would provoke ' ' punitive action ' ' from abroad . But he felt compelled to ' ' keep his country from becoming a Vietnam , Nicaragua , Kampuchea ( Cambodia ) , Afghanistan , or Iran.

It lasted nearly a year , claimed nearly 600 lives , but wound down under the joint pressure of arrests , police reprisal , and inertia. // ' ' Even we were surprised by the scale and duration of the uprising , ' ' says one black community leader in Soweto , who began his political career in 1976 . ' ' I think one reason the violence ended is that it was that even we felt the need to catch our breath , evaluate . ' ' That , he says , ' ' is much less the case in the current uprising. ' ' // Many 1976 leaders have matured , mellowed , married , and had children . According to one of them , ' ' I ' m sometimes scared , frankly , by the new militancy that has taken hold . ' ' He and other political analysts here note differences between the 1976 trouble and the escalating violence of the past 21 months. // One difference is that the 1976 violence was essentially a student revolt . Its battle cry was ' ' black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in a political , economic , and social system that excluded them. // The current unrest , though powered by militant youths , involves older leaders as well - from communities , churches , businesses , and the black labor-union movement that was legalized in 1979 . The aim has also changed . Many blacks now seek not so much a role in the current South Africa as an overhaul of the political system and a major redistribution of wealth. // The earlier revolt was a Soweto revolt that spread with no discernible pattern or method to other black townships . The present violence has been more national in scale and more costly in terms of lives . Some 1 , 600 have died in the current upheaval. // In 1976 , unrest lacked political coherence or organization . The violence now raging has been sustained with the help of increasingly direct political involvement by the banned African National Congress , the most prominent black movement seeking the overthrow of South Africa ' s government . Joining the ANC in anti-apartheid activities are other union and black-consciousness groups , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Democratic Front. // Outside elements have also helped sustain the momentum of unrest - notably , foreign political and economic pressures. // In 1976 , then-Prime Minister John Vorster took an unrelievedly tough line . But today ' s President Botha has coupled tough police action with a strategy of gradual political reforms , some of which predated the present violence . As recently as several weeks ago , in a television address , he vowed to sustain both an unyielding campaign to stamp out unrest , and new efforts to negotiate some form of black participation in South African government. // But perhaps the most important difference between the two revolts is that police muscle has , at least so far , failed seriously to faze the current violence . Last July , Botha imposed a similar ' ' state of emergency ' ' in several dozen judicial districts . He has , in contrast to 1976 , used not only police but Army units in a bid to quell the unrest . But two months ago , with implicit acknowledgment that the clampdown had not worked , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech yesterday that there would be no early lifting of the new and more widespread emergency powers . He said that , despite his announced political reforms , ' ' violence has continued or even increased ' ' and quelling it once and for all was a prerequisite for negotiation with the ' ' reasonable majority ' ' among South African blacks. // The country ' s major black leaders have dismissed Botha ' s reforms as mere window dressing . The youngsters who have increasingly come to dominate township politics seem to feel that only continued violence can secure the political changes they demand . Their main target has been fellow blacks , such as local government officials and police , against whom they have launched acts of arson , assault , and murder. // Says one clergyman , ' ' The change is that large numbers of young people simply have stopped attaching much importance to human life - whether the lives of others whom they feel have betrayed the struggle or their own lives . They are willing to kill and to die. ' ' // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
