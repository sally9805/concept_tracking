For more than 110 years there were three things American investors could count on : death , taxes and a profit at AT &T.; Now they are back to two . For the first time since 1877 , when Alexander Graham Bell founded what was then called the Bell Telephone Co. , the telecommunications empire will post a loss for the year . The deficit , which could run as high as $1.7 billion , will be the result of AT &T's; decision last week to scrap $5.6 billion worth of outdated equipment . In a drive to modernize , the company is replacing 2 billion miles of telephone connections with higher-capacity fiber-optic lines . AT &T; will also install more digital switchboards and other advanced gear , which will eliminate 16,000 jobs . In the fourth quarter alone , the cost to the company will be $6.7 billion . <P> Competition from rivals MCI and Sprint hastened the move . Both companies can undercut AT &T's; tolls on long-distance calls because their networks use fiber- optic cable almost exclusively . The light-wave lines , which transmit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite communications , form less than half of AT &T's; telephone grid . <P> Ma Bell 's pain could become the consumer 's gain , since the improvements may allow the company to keep lowering its toll charges . AT &T; still commands 70% of the $50 billion long-distance market , but has grown increasingly price conscious in its rivalry with MCI and Sprint . Even so , the lateness of the move has shaken some investors ' confidence in Ma Bell . Says James Meyer , a telecommunications analyst with the Philadelphia investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott : " My question is , Is this it ? Or will we have to go through this again ?
