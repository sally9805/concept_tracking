HONEYSUCKLE ROSE <P> Directed by Jerry Schatzberg <P> Screenplay by Carol Sobieski , William D. Wittliffand John Binder <P> No less likely a sex star has emerged since Miss Piggy . This rodeo raga muffin-with his Indian headbands , his long braided hair , a diamond stud in his left earlobe and a face as seamed and leathery as a football left out in the Texas sun-looks like the last of the red hot Muppets . No matter : the camera loves Willie Nelson . In The Electric Horseman , he simply leaned back , squinted , expectorated a few down-home aphorisms and stole a scene or two from Robert Redford . Now Nelson has been fitted for a sin-and-suffer role out of a ' 30s weepie-the Leslie Howard part in Intermezzo , to be precise-and he wears it as comfortably as a pair of custom-made boots . <P> Honeysuckle Rose takes its cue from the plangent homilies of country music . Buck Bonham ( Nelson ) is a moderately successful singer with a strong , loving wife ( Dyan Cannon ) , an adoring son ( Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitarist ( Amy Irving ) who snakes her way into Buck 's band and bed . Once she and Buck become lovers , the dramatic tension slackens . Seven decades of movie romance have prepared the audience for a climactic reconciliation of Buck and his wife . And since Amy Irving acts as if she bought her clothes and her accent at Bloomingdale 's , Buck 's infatuation seems perfunctory . It is simply one long bumpy road he must travel on his way back to home and honey . <P> For much of the trip , though , Honeysuckle Rose provides good , earthy company . And when Nelson and Cannon team to sing a sexy country duet , the romantic charge is as strong as any pairing since Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman-or at least since Kermit and Miss Piggy . - R.C.
