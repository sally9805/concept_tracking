When King Sobhuza II of Swaziland died in 1982 after 61 years on the throne , the people of that tiny southern African kingdom lamented , Umntfwana sowuphumulile : the child has gone to rest . Now the slogan of the day in Swaziland ( pop . 800,000 ) is a much more cheerful Umntfwana sowukhulile : the child has grown into a man . <P> The object of that acclaim is Sobhuza 's strong-willed son and successor , Mswati III , at 19 the world 's youngest reigning monarch . Five years after his father 's death , Mswati has finally shown that he can use his full regal powers with a vengeance . So far this year he has arrested a dozen high Swazi officials , including five members of the royal family , on suspicion of sedition and treason . Says a Swazi journalist in Mbabane , the capital : " Mswati is clearly angry at the intrigue that took place following his father 's death and is determined to put things right . " <P> Some of that intrigue almost seems inspired by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly known as Prince Makhosetive , officially took the throne in April of last year . For the four previous years , Swaziland had been ruled by a regent , initially Queen Dzeliwe , one of Sobhuza 's 50 or more wives , though not the mother of the current King . In 1983 Prince Mfanasibili , a powerful member of the Liqoqo , or royal advisory council , masterminded Dzeliwe 's ouster and replaced her with Ntombi , mother of the young King-to-be . Mfanasibili then talked the new Queen regent into allowing him and his coterie to take political control over the Liqoqo and thereby in effect run the country . <P> Mfanasibili went to bizarre lengths to maintain his position . In 1983 , while the youthful Prince Makhosetive was attending a private school in Dorset , England ( where he was known to classmates as " Mac " ) , Mfanasibili charged that several members of the royal house had plotted to assassinate their future King . The weapon of choice , according to Mfanasibili , was a witch doctor , who was sent to England to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of Mfanasibili 's charges , several princes loyal to the ousted Queen regent were detained without trial , as were a handful of ranking Swazi officials , including police and army chiefs . <P> By the time Mswati was installed as King last year , however , Mfanasibili was in deep trouble . His enemies on the Liqoqo had rallied against him , leading to Mfanasibili 's trial and subsequent conviction on charges of framing his political opponents . He was given a seven-year jail sentence . Five months later Mswati , in a spirited gesture of independence , fired his Prime Minister and cousin , Bhekimpi Dlamini , before a crowd of thousands , and then appointed a former personal bodyguard to the job . Finally , in May the King ordered the arrest and detention of Bhekimpi and eleven others , including five princes and princesses , a Cabinet minister and the former national ombudsman . Trial dates have not been set for any of the detainees .
