In the hills of Greece at the turn of the century there lived a giant . The giant 's name was George Smerlas , but everyone called him the Tree . The Tree was seven feet tall and weighed 350 pounds , and in a country suffused with legend he soon earned a place in the folklore of the time . It was said that when he cleared the land , he would uproot trees with his hands . Once , when he was coming home from work , a mountain lion attacked him . The Tree grappled with the beast and ripped its tail off , and the lion fled . The story spread , and people would travel great distances to look at this modern Hercules . // The Tree 's descendants eventually immigrated to America . They were sturdy people , hard workers , and some of them were athletes , but there were no giants among them . Then , on April 8 , 1957 , Peter Smerlas , who stood 5 ' 10 " , and his 5 ' 6 " wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred . He was the great-great-nephew of the Tree . // Fred was born with a full head of hair . The priest twice gave Peter and Katina permission to cut it before baptizing him . At six months Fred was already walking . " Nobody believes it , " says Fred now . " But my mother will tell you it 's true . " // Soon after , he climbed onto a window ledge of his family 's ranch-style home in Waltham , Mass . When his parents saw him , he was laughing . " He was a jovial baby , " says Katina. // Fred was shaving in the eighth grade , bench-pressing 440 pounds in the 12th . By then he stood 6 ' 3 " and weighed 250 pounds . Two years later he would weigh 305 . The Tree 's genes had skipped two generations and settled in him . // In the hills of Greece , Fred would have been a worthy successor to his legendary ancestor , a mighty man with plow or ax , but in the New World a youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eye goes into sports . As a schoolboy Fred excelled at football , wrestling , weightlifting and the shot put , and at present he is thriving in an NFL career that is a testimony to his indestructibility. // Fred is in his 10th season with the Buffalo Bills , for whom he plays nose-guard , the most brutal position in football . Only one other player in NFL history  --  Rubin Carter , who played 152 games at noseguard for the Denver Broncos  --  has lined up at that spot more times than Smerlas , who has played in 140 games , 130 as a starter . Smerlas holds the record for consecutive starts  --  the number depends on how you want to handle last year 's player strike . If you throw out the three strike games , then Smerlas , who did n't cross the picket line , is working on a string of 127 . If you end the streak at the start of the strike , then the number is 107 . Either way it 's a record . Curley Culp , who set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the league , but was at noseguard in only six of them  --  77 starts . The rest of the time he was a defensive tackle . // So how does Smerlas do it ? First of all , you have to consider his body . Hairy as a bear , thick as a barrel , Smerlas weighs 290 to 300 pounds during the season and as much as 330 in the off-season . He 's massive through the legs , which have absorbed a decade of cut-blocking , double-teams and crackbacks . Then there 's the matter of pain . Smerlas has n't missed a game because of injury since he partially tore cartilage in his right knee at the end of 1979 , his rookie year . // " He 's played with a hyperextended elbow and a pinched rotator cuff , " says Bills trainer Eddie Abramoski . " He 's played with a sprained ankle that was twice its normal size and a wrist that was so badly sprained he could n't bend it . ' Tape me up , ' he said . He puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I tell him no permanent harm could result . " // Loud and boisterous  --  you can stand in the hallway and know immediately whether Smerlas is in the locker room  --  he plays the game the way they did 50 years ago . " Are you Zorba the Greek ? " a TV man asked him a few years ago after a game . // " Absorba the Greek , " Smerlas said . // He ended four of his early seasons with appearances in the Pro Bowl . After that came a slump and rumors that he was washed up . Then a renaissance . " He 's playing as well as he ever has , " says Buffalo coach Marv Levy . " Even better . " // History will judge Smerlas to have been one of the greatest noseguards ever . The guys in the locker room consider him a pain in the ... well , Freddy 's Freddy . " Look at that locker , " Abramoski says , pointing to the chaos in Smerlas 's cubicle . " Five years ago there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Freddy 's locker . Too dirty . " // " Yeah , but it ate there , " says Smerlas. // " How about that desk you bought for $39 ? " yells Jim Kelly , the quarterback . " Tell him about your $39 desk . " // " True Value was running a special on it all week for $39 , " says Smerlas . " A prefab you put together yourself . So I bought one . Now it 's selling for $29. " // " A prefab desk  --  that 's you , Freddy ! " says Kelly . // " Hey , Kelly , better put your hat on , " Smerlas roars , pointing to Kelly 's thinning hair . " An eagle 's flying around , and he thinks your head is an egg . " // " He calls up my wife , Harriett , " says guard Jim Ritcher , the only Buffalo player who 's hairier than Smerlas , " and he says , ' This is Frank 's Landscaping . We 've been hired to groom Jim 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you quit that , ' and he says , ' Yeah , well I guess Jim needs to get a good night 's sleep . He has to shave tomorrow . ' " // A newspaper reporter is interviewing Smerlas after the Sept. 25 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . " Are you afraid of overconfidence now that you 're 4-0 ? " asks the scribe . // " Nah , it 's not the makeup of this team , " says Smerlas. // " What is its makeup ? " // " Light eyeliner , a little blush , " Smerlas says . // When he was at Boston College , a few of the coaches termed Smerlas uncoachable . " You know why ? " he says . " Because I asked questions . When I 'm interviewed , I say what I want to say . Hank Bullough , the coach who was fired when they brought Marv Levy in here , said , ' You 're one of those quotable guys , are n't you ? ' Then I was told not to talk . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , though , Smerlas has learned obedience  --  of sorts . " We have a dress code on trips , " he says . " Shirt , tie and jacket . I 've got this Hawaiian shirt I wear every trip . This year one of the rookies said , ' Oh , that 's a Hawaiian shirt , ' and I said , ' Very good , you pass the test . ' I wear that shirt and a red tie I have n't unknotted in five years . I just slip it over . " // When linebacker Jim Haslett was with the Bills , he and Smerlas had an unusual pregame ritual . " We 'd go through the game program in the locker room and compare our pictures with the other team 's and then vote , position by position , to see which team was uglier . The Patriots were a team we always beat . Ugliest team of the ' 80s ? Atlanta . // " If I was in early enough , I 'd get a whole box of game programs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danelo , our kicker . You know , he had that great big schnozz , and I 'd paste it over everyone 's picture . I 'd make a whole team of Joe Danelos . Then I 'd cut out Jim Ritcher 's face and make a Mr. Potato Head and paste Reggie McKenzie 's bald fringe on top . This kid , Joe Azelby , a linebacker from Harvard , came by one time , and he said , I always wondered how you prepared for a game . Now I know . ' " // So what 's the story ? Was Smerlas always a wacko , or has he just played too many games at noseguard ? " He was a pudgy kid with ears sticking out , " says Smerlas 's older brother , Peter , who holds a master 's in psychology from the University of Massachusetts . " Every year he wanted a chemistry set . He was like a little mad scientist . He was n't interested in sports . He 'd make bombs . You 'd leave him in the cellar alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night he 'd talk to himself . That 's why I studied psychology , to figure him out . " // " Right up to high school I was a nice quiet kid , very mellow , never wanted to fight , " says Smerlas . " My first day at Central Junior High , here was old Freddy in his checkered pants and penny loafers . I walked down the aisle in my first class , and a kid sucker-punched me . I went down to the nurse . ' What happened ? ' she said . I said , ' I do n't know . ' // " Kids would roll apples and pennies down the aisles . One kid threw a knife and it stuck in the wall next to the teacher . I 'd go home and look in the mirror  --  chubby , goofy-looking kid with big ears  --  and I 'd say , ' Man , I 've got to do something to survive here . ' So I started lifting weights . And I 'd hit a speed bag  --  I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . My body started to change . // " I never forgot , though . When I was in junior high a kid jacked me up one day and stole a quarter . Seven years later , when I was at BC , I saw him downtown in a Volkswagen . I ran over and started smashing the car with my fists . He said , ' What the hell are you doing ? ' // " I said , ' Seven years ago you stole a quarter from me. ' // " He said , ' What are you , nuts or something ? ' // " I said , ' You should n't have done it . See , it 's come back to haunt you . ' " // Smerlas started playing football as a 190-pound 10th-grader . Eventually he became a high school All-America as well as the New England heavyweight wrestling champ in his junior and senior years . He was 60-0 on the mat during that span . Fifty-eight of those victories came on pins , 50 in the first period . " Wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd look at a move and I 'd know it . In my senior year a kid lasted 1:01 and got a standing ovation . Mothers used to come up to me and say , ' Do n't hurt my son . ' I 'd tell them , ' I 'm not going to hurt him , just pin him . ' " // Smerlas ran around with a lively group . It was called Freddy 's Army , and everyone wore a trench coat . Among the enlistees were Rockhead McCarthy ; the Martin brothers , Tiny and George ; Paul Delaney , who was nicknamed Muncher because he used to take bites out of people ; and Tommy Hernandez , who was known as Tommy the Pimp because he drove a big green Cadillac . " One of the teachers thought he was a real pimp , " says Smerlas . " He asked him to fix him up with a girl . " // College recruiters were always around . " Every day when I came home from school , there would be someone showing my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up at BC with his friend David Poirier , whose father had coached them at Waltham High . " David was a quarterback in high school , " says Smerlas , " but they made him a linebacker at BC . He had a head like concrete . Once he was running down the field , and he lost his helmet hitting a guy . So he hit another guy without it . He 'd point to his forehead and say , ' Go ahead , hit me . ' I did  --  and broke a knuckle . // " Six guys were in our room at BC . We had pig roasts out back . I must have been thrown out of the dorm six times  --  and reinstated . In the summers we 'd go back to the P &amp; P Gym in Waltham and lift weights . The place was filled with 250-and 260-pound screamers . Eat and sweat and lift , that 's all they did . This one guy  --  he was about 40  --  had tattoos all over his body , even his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison for five years and had stowed away on a boat . He used to beat himself with a wire brush until the blood flowed to get ready to lift . // " Sometimes we 'd go down to this restaurant in Sudbury  --  JT 's . It 's closed now . Lobster , all you can eat , for $19.95 . One night 10 guys ate 180 lobsters . There 'd be a line of fat people outside . It looked like a zoo . I 'd be ashamed to go there . It was the fat persons ' fix . They 'd take ' em out in a forklift . " // Smerlas weighed 305 when he came home during his sophomore year . " Muscle shirt , pants with suspenders , Fu Manchu , long hair  --  my mother started crying when she saw me , " he says . " She said , ' It does n't look like you . ' " // In his senior year , though , the BC coach , Ed Chlebek , decided he wanted a leaner squad . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He would n't let me eat . I dropped to 265 and looked like a skeleton . " // The Eagles went 0-11 , but the scouts were impressed by Smerlas , who was a defensive end . He never took a play off . " I had no technique , " he says . " I just wanted to kill the guy in front of me . We used to beat people up and lose . We had something like 35 turnovers in our first five games . I was out of control . I 'd spit and scream and grab face masks . I remember someone once talking to me on the field and how weird it felt , so I started doing it . I would n't go to our defensive huddle . Instead , I 'd stand there yelling at the other team . Our linebacker , Jeff Dziama , would say , ' Shut up , Freddy . ' I 'd say , ' You shut up ! ' " // The Bills drafted Smerlas with the first of two second-round picks ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other . In Haslett , who once said , " I do n't like any hobbies where you sit down , like playing the guitar or collecting stamps , " Smerlas had a teammate who was as zany as he was . In bars people would come up to them and say , " Yeah , you 're the crazy ones . " // " We 'd put on acts , throw stuff at each other , start wrestling , " says Smerlas . " People would ask me , ' How 'd you get so big , lifting weights ? ' I 'd say , ' Nah , I wrapped cookies . ' " // Smerlas and the two inside linebackers behind him , Haslett and Shane Nelson , became the Bermuda Triangle , the heart of a defense that went from 24th in the league in 1978 ( and last against the run ) to first in 1980 . Smerlas made his first trip to the Pro Bowl , and the Bills reached the playoffs for the first time in six years . They went again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio show on WBEN . It was wild , naturally . // " We 'd say anything that came into our heads , " says Smerlas . " We 'd have **38;508;TOOLONG contests , **31;548;TOOLONG contests . The callers would get out of control sometimes . Our fingers would be on the click button to turn ' em off if things got too bad . Sometimes all you 'd hear would be click-click-click. " // As wild as he was off the field , Smerlas was deadly serious about his profession . Plenty of sleep , no drinking Tuesday nights through Saturday nights . " I had no idea how to play noseguard when I started , " he says . " I 'd been a penetrating end in college . One of our coaches told me I would never be able to play in the NFL . I went back to my apartment . I ca n't play ? What am I going to do for a living ? // " I got films of all the good noseguards and defensive tackles , and I 'd watch them after practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head butt and pull , body leverage . Curley Culp , a bull , a straight-ahead banger . Rubin Carter , the swim and the arm-over . Randy White , mesmerize ' em with the head , shake and bake . // " I developed my own style : crowd the ball , get as close to the center as possible , square my stance and get my hands into him quickly . If I was quick enough , he 'd take me where I wanted to go . It was read on the run . I was like the Sundance Kid  --  could n't shoot straight except when he would draw . That was me . I could read moving , but not sitting . // " Dwight Stephenson the veteran Dolphin center made me change my style  --  for him . He developed the technique of holding the ball way out away from him , and he was so fast that he 'd use my momentum against me and throw me sideways . I had to change the angle of my charge . The AFC East was the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the bunch . // " Pete Brock of the Patriots , a class act all the way . He came out low and killed you . The first time I faced him , he broke my face mask on the opening play . Stephenson had blinding speed . You hit him , it was like you 'd touched a live wire , his body was moving so quickly . There was Ray Donaldson of the Colts , a big guy who was coming on , and my nemesis , Joe Fields of the Jets . // " A magician in his prime , Fields did it with mirrors . He was the craftiest guy in football . The first time I played him he looked tight , short , small . Hey , I thought , I 'm going to kill this guy . I tried to ram him , and he wound up on the side of me , on top of me . I punch him , he punches me . This guy does n't look like a tough guy , but I ca n't lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still here , you sonofabitch ! ' He was right . I could n't figure out that guy 's style . No one could . " // As the Bills got good , Smerlas became one of the town 's favorite sports figures . Remember that famous bit after Buffalo beat the Los Angeles Rams in overtime in 1980 , when Smerlas , Haslett and Ritcher returned to the field in their T-shirts , formed a high-kick line with the cheerleaders and sang a chorus of the Bills ' song , We 're Talking Proud ? Those were the high times  --  down-to-earth guys in a no-nonsense town . // Smerlas moved into a house with Ritcher , linebacker Chris Keating and defensive end Scott Hutchinson . They insisted that the house was haunted . " Hey , no kidding , it really was haunted , " says Smerlas . " I 'd be lying in bed and I 'd hear deep breathing behind the walls . Remember that scene in The Amityville Horror with all the flies ? Well , one day I saw the same thing , 50 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they were gone . I came home one night and there 's Hutch sitting in his car outside . He would n't go in the house alone . // " Hutch had this BB rifle . One night he bet me he could run across the hall before I could shoot him . So I did . Then it was double or nothing . I got him again . Another double or nothing , only this time he tripped and tried to roll across . He flopped on his back and I got him six times . Ritcher was laughing so hard his muscles were swelling up . // " One day in practice I hit Ritcher in the head and got him mad . When I came home that night , Jim was sitting in front of the fireplace . He had a football card of me with 50 BB holes in it . He was sitting there shooting it . " // In 1984 came the big slide . Coach Chuck Knox had left after the ' 82 season . The next year the Bills went 8-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stephenson was fired in his third season , and his replacement , Bullough , was fired in his second . Smerlas has had six defensive coordinators and six defensive line coaches . " Everyone tried to change my style , " he says . // Before the ' 84 season Smerlas signed a four-year contract that made him the second-highest-paid Bill , after quarterback Joe Ferguson . But his sack total dropped that year , as did his tackles , and the fans started getting on him . He had a habit of jumping offside . In the old days the fans accepted it ; now he was booed when he drew the penalty . In 1985 , Bullough brought in former Atlanta Falcon Don Smith to replace Smerlas on passing downs . The following year Bullough signed journeyman Jerry Boyarsky to relieve him . // " They were telling me , in a sense , that I was washed up , " says Smerlas . " Guys would be on and off the team . You 'd come into the locker room and see who 'd parachuted into practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WBEN dropped Smerlas and Haslett 's show . The team had gone 8-40 the last three seasons , from 1984 to ' 86 . The gags were no longer funny . The only plus in his life was a woman he 'd met through backup nose-guard Bill Acker . Acker had told him , " You 've got to meet this beautiful teacher from Toronto , and she 's Greek , too . " // Kris Kefalas had said that the last thing she wanted in life was to marry a man of Greek heritage . Daddy was old world . A good Greek girl lives only to take care of her home and her husband . Not this Greek girl , said Kris . " When I was little , " she says , " the only Greek words my father taught me were the ones to use to keep the boys away . " // But she saw something in Smerlas . Sure , he was a big , rough guy , but he also was quick and bright . He asked her to call him  --  please  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , and sweat was pouring off me , I was so nervous , " recalls Smerlas . " My roommate , Sean McNanie , the defensive end , started kidding around . I told him , ' Shut up , Sean . I swear to God I 'll smash this chair over your head . I 'll smash everything in this room over your head . ' " // Fred and Kris dated for a couple of years and were married in February of this year . " Fred did two things for me , " says Kris . " He made me proud to be Greek again , and he brought me back to being close with my father . " // In 1987 , Levy was in his first full year as coach . The team had young talent  --  Kelly , rookie linebackers Shane Conlan and Cornelius Bennett , defensive end Bruce Smith . Smerlas was 30 and in the last year of his contract . " The first game after the strike we played Miami and were down 21-3 at the half , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive tackle and the oldest guy on the team . His contract was up after that year , too . Both of us felt our heads were in the noose , that it was all on the line for us , right then . " The Bills won 34-31 in overtime and finished the year with a 7-8 record . Now they 're leading the AFC East , and Smerlas and Devlin are playing top-quality football again . // Fred and Kris live a mile from the stadium in a modest house he and McNanie shared for four years . " It cost $60,000 when I bought it , " he says , " and now it 's been appraised at $61,000. " // After 9 years in the league Smerlas is still down-to-earth . " He bought me a sewing machine for a wedding present , " says Kris , " but he would n't let me go downtown and pick it up until he was sure he had made the team . " // " The farther along in my career I get , the more insecure I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . People get , " he says . " You want get out of the game and they say , ' I do n't need football anymore . ' Then it 's gone and they realize how much they need it . // " What would I like ? To get a ring . You see guys who are second-stringers walking around with rings ; you see strength coaches with ' em . I just want to play long enough to see what it 's like . "
