During the past four months , 300,000 ministers have received a box by mail bearing these words : A GIFT FOR YOU FROM SOME FOLKS WHO CARE . Inside are pamphlets , two books and six hours of doctrinal lectures on videocassettes . The 5-lb. gift packs are part of an extravagant p.r . effort by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon 's controversial , 45,000-member Unification Church of America . <P> The $4.5 million mail blitz is only the latest tactic in a $30 million cosmetic campaign being waged by the Moon movement . The church was founded in South Korea in 1954 and now claims 3 million followers worldwide , a figure that some outside researchers consider inflated . The propaganda program has been taking place while Moon , 65 , is serving an 18-month term in the Danbury , Conn. , federal prison for income tax fraud ; he is due for release Aug. 20 . <P> The campaign is designed to explain Unification doctrine , polish the sect 's tarnished image and achieve mainstream respectability . In the past year , for example , 7,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean , Europe and Asia , as well as at U.S. sites . Moon- related scientific conferences have tried to win prestige by signing up Nobel scholars , while a Unification-backed anti-Communist agency seeks allies among fundamentalists . Capitalizing on its ownership of the daily Washington Times and New York Tribune , the Moon movement has run junkets for hundreds of journalists to soften media hostility . <P> Unificationism needs all the friends it can get . The theology commission of the National Council of Churches has ruled that the organization " is not a Christian church . " Indeed , Moon proclaims that Christ failed to achieve complete salvation for humanity and that a Korean messiah will appear in this century . Hundreds of parents have charged that their brainwashed children often ended up on the streets selling flowers for Moon while he lived in luxury at a 25-room estate . Mose Durst , a convert from Judaism who is president of the Unification Church of America , candidly admits that " the image of us is that we have four-year-olds locked in iceboxes in the basement . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many have voiced their objection to Moon 's imprisonment . He has protested that his conviction amounts to selective persecution of an unpopular religion . A wide variety of religious leaders agree , including the National Council , Moral Majority Founder Jerry Falwell , and Roman Catholic Bishop Ernest Unterkoefler of Charleston , S.C . <P> Toleration does not , however , translate into esteem , though there seems to be much less hysteria about Moon now than there was in the 1970s . California Cult Foe Lowell D. Streiker thinks Moon 's imprisonment may strengthen the loyalties of disciples , " but it does n't help in recruitment or in image building . " An even stronger view is taken by Anson Shupe of the University of Texas at Arlington , an expert on the movement . He sees a loss of momentum in the Moon cult , viewing it as an organization in disarray , pouring " millions of dollars down the drain " and unable to hold on to recruits . Says he : " What the Moonies do is ludicrous . Most people who go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
