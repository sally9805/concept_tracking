Threads of evidence produce an arrest in Atlanta <P> Two fibers , three or four dog hairs and one loud splash . Slim shreds of evidence , but last week they were enough to convince a Georgia magistrate that Wayne Bertram Williams , 23 , should face a grand jury for possible indictment in the murder of Nathaniel Cater , 27 , the most recent of the 28 young blacks found slain in Atlanta . Williams showed no emotion as Magistrate Albert Thompson read the decision upholding the arrest . Only later , as he was transferred back to his 6-ft. by 12-ft. isolation cell in Fulton County Jail , did the suspect comment : " This is ridiculous ! " <P> Williams ' lawyer certainly seems to think so . The case against her client , though only sketchily presented at the hearing , is " very , very weak , " said Mary Welcome . It appears to rest on events observed by police in the predawn hours of May 22 , when Williams was first stopped and questioned by authorities near a bridge on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the suspect 's home . <P> Police Cadet Freddy Jacobs testified that he saw Williams driving " really slow " and unusually close to the edge of the bridge that morning after another policeman had reported a loud splashing sound . Lieut . J.T. Campbell testified that he had helped recover Cater 's body from the river two days later . In crossexamination , Williams ' attorneys tried to show that the splash could have been made by a beaver . Later , Welcome pointed out that " no one even saw Williams ' car stop that night on the bridge . " Throwing the 146-lb . Cater from a moving automobile , she said , would have been virtually impossible . <P> More evidence for the prosecution came from Georgia Crime Lab Microanalyst Larry Peterson . A purple thread from Williams ' bedspread , a green fiber from his bedroom rug and several hairs from his pet German shepherd , said Peterson , showed " no significant microscopic difference " from fibers found in Cater 's hair . Police have long hinted at the importance of this " trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been confirmed by forensic experts from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . None of this seemed to impress Defense Attorney Welcome . Said she to reporters after the hearing : " Any one of you could have killed Cater . You all have fibers in your hair . "
