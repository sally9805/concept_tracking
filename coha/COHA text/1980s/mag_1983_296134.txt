The severe strains besetting the 34-year-old Atlantic Alliance have long been a concern of TIME 'S editors , both in print and out . Last week they acted on that concern by convening 45 representatives from seven NATO countries , including politicians government officials , academics and think-tank analysts , for a three-day Atlantic Conference ' 83 in Hamburg , West Germany . Explains Editor-in-Chief Henry Grunwald , who led TIME 'S delegation of 26 editors , writers and correspondents : " We all know that the survival and strength of the Atlantic Alliance , military , political , economic , are of the utmost importance to world peace . We wanted to find some way to focus on these issues , draw new insights and offer some possible solutions . " <P> The job of organizing the ambitious undertaking , held at Hamburg 's appropriately named Atlantic Hotel , fell to Deputy Chief of Correspondents B. William Mader . Working closely with the staffs of the Bonn , Paris , London , Rome and Washington bureaus , Mader oversaw every detail , from arranging participants ' travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner menus . <P> In addition to four formal speeches , including a provocative opening address by former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , the conference revolved around three discussion groups-on defense , politics and economics-where the experts engaged in stimulating , sometimes heated , debate . At a final plenary meeting , members of the groups shared conclusions . The sessions were supplemented by freewheeling conversation over coffee , cocktails and meals . " It 's just remarkable the people who are here , " observed Enrico Jacchia , director of the Italian Center of Strategic Studies . " If we 'd had some more meetings like this in the past , we would never have had a dispute over sanctions , " said U.S. Trade Ambassador William Brock , referring to last year 's dispute over the Soviet gas pipeline to Western Europe . Noted France 's former Ambassador to NATO Franois de Rose : " The discussions were very frank , almost too frank at times . " <P> This week 's story analyzing those discussions was written by International Senior Writer Frederick Painton . Says he : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the mutual recognition of the need for the alliance , stopped being abstractions . They were acted out before our eyes . "
