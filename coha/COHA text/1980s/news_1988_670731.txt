Mr. Greenberg ' s characters have youth , brains , money and classy professions . Their last names - Wheeler , Paley , Kidde - are redolent of Philip Barry ' s Park Avenue ; their fresh good looks and bubbly voices recall Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda . And like Carole Lombard , the heiress who adopts a tramp in " My Man Godfrey , " or Joel McCrea , the Hollywood director who goes underground as a hobo in " Sullivan ' s Travels , " they are driven by conscience to see how the other half lives . The bright young things of " Eastern Standard " invite a bag lady to stay with them in the Hamptons. // If Mr. Greenberg ' s only achievement were to re-create the joy of screwball comedies , from their elegant structure to their endlessly quotable dialogue , " Eastern Standard " would be merely dazzling good fun . But what gives this play its unexpected weight and subversive punch is its author ' s ability to fold the traumas of his own time into vintage comedy without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effervescent theatrical form . " Eastern Standard " opens with its characters meeting cute in a Manhattan restaurant ; it ends with them toasting their future happiness on a Long Island beach . Yet in between , both Mr. Greenberg ' s people and his audience have been rocked by the plight of a city in the midst of " a nervous breakdown . " It ' s a city where developers rob the poor of their homes and the entire citizenry of its sunlight . It ' s a city where people constantly wake up with hot sweats - whether they are guilty perpetrators of financial corruption or innocent victims of AIDS. // When we first meet the four incipient lovers of " Eastern Standard " at a restaurant serving such dishes as grouper tortellini , they are too selfish and complacent to worry much about all that . Drew ( Peter Frechette ) is a downtown painter whose epater le bourgeois pose and haughty verbal " reflex of belittlement " are at hypocritical odds with his decadent existence . His best friend from Dartmouth days , Stephen ( Dylan Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicity in Manhattan ' s urban blight . At the neighboring table are Phoebe ( Patricia Clarkson ) , a Wall Street investment counselor caught up in an insider trading scandal , and her brother , Peter ( Kevin Conroy ) , a television producer who spends " days at a time defending nearly invisible principles " while pounding socially conscious scripts into fluff at CBS. // Since Drew and Peter are both gay , and Stephen and Phoebe are not , it ' s only minutes before the college chums and brother and sister can mix and match in a way Preston Sturges never could have imagined in " The Palm Beach Story . " In his ingenious first act , Mr. Greenberg achieves the couplings with three overlapping scenes , Alan Ayckbourn-style , that replay the same action from the varying perspectives of different tables in the restaurant . Even then , a disturbing counterpoint accompanies the heavy-breathing flirtations . As the sexual repartee reaches its crescendo , so do the disquieting obscenities of an unseen woman trying to storm the barricades of Upper East Side trendiness. // That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a casualty of welfare bureaucracy who just wants " to sit like everyone else and drink some Perrier water . " When her wish comes true in screwball fashion at Stephen ' s beach home after intermission , Mr. Greenberg manages to uphold the escapist tone of his classic Hollywood models while refusing to permit his characters to escape . Act II of " Eastern Standard , " set on a beautiful beachfront designed by Philipp Jung and lighted by Dennis Parichy , retains the champagne-informed dizziness of the poolside wedding eve in " The Philadelphia Story . " Freed from inhibition as if by magic , the characters switch partners , quit their jobs and vow to be reborn . But May isn ' t a cuddly homeless doll ; she refuses to disappear in " the wonderful solvent of a politically correct project . " When the pretty lovers of " Eastern Standard " finally sober up , it is not merely because they ' ve figured out whom they really love but because they at last see their true roles , hardly attractive ones , in the urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift and buoyant direction of Michael Engler , " Eastern Standard " goes by so blithely that not until after it ' s over can one dip beneath the play ' s brilliant surface to explore its depths . Mr. Greenberg , a 30-year-old writer whose previous work includes a one-act play of great promise ( " Life Under Water " ) as well as the arch full-length " Maderati , " is maturing at an accelerating rate . " Eastern Standard " itself has been enriched considerably since its May premiere at the Seattle Repertory Theater. // As always , this playwright is a fount of epigrammatic lines and bright jokes . Julian Schnabel ( among others ) is described as being on " the cutting edge of the passe , " and one offstage mother is deemed so conservative that " there ' s not a revolution in history that would have failed to execute her . " The laughs never depart from a human foundation . Here is that uncommon writer who can make heterosexual and homosexual romances equally credible and erotic . The play ' s close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressively , is the college-spawned fraternity between Drew and Stephen . Whether engaging in juvenile locker-room humor or propping each other up in tearful sorrow , these two friends achieve a fluent intimacy that , in my experience , has never previously been alloted to male stage characters of opposite sexual preference. // With the occasional exception of the gifted Mr. Frechette , who caricatures Drew ' s facetiousness in Act I before hitting an affecting stride , the acting is as full-bodied as the play . Mr. Baker and Ms. Clarkson , who have floated about Off Broadway in supporting roles for a few seasons now , are transformed into radiant leading players by " Eastern Standard . " Like Stewart and Hepburn , they convey appealing but muddled moral rectitude that can flare into either intoxicating giddiness or bitter self-recrimination as the champagne flows on. // In an extremely tough assignment , Ms. Meara is scrupulous in refusing to conform to the sentimentalized role that her bleeding-heart benefactors wish her to play . Her bag lady strikes the perfect balance beween Lily Tomlin-like curmudgeonliness and frightening psychosis . Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncliched as a struggling actress representing the hard-put Manhattan economic class just above the homeless , and Mr. Conroy is touching as the producer determined to resist self-pity despite having AIDS . " No one ever looked at me without thinking I ' d live forever , " he says , and , indeed , he looks like a Bruce Weber model in an advertisement for Ralph Lauren beachwear . Later , when Mr. Conroy breaks the tranquillity of the pose and its setting by crying out a simple , terrifying line - " I ' m sick ! " - the effect is devastating . As his rage tears through the Hamptons landscape , it seems to lower the curtain on a Bloomingdale ' s diorama of a decade in which easy money and easy pleasure were unlimited for the privileged few. // Just the same , and perhaps to the distress of ideologues , the author refuses to condemn outright his once-charmed and always charming characters . Mr. Greenberg has no better utopian schemes for conquering social inequities than they do . Like Drew , who is a middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Greenberg must write about what he knows : people who got fat from the ethos of the 1980 ' s but may finally begin to examine the connection between their own behavior and the sick city left in the wake of the spree. // True to form , " Eastern Standard " holds out hope for its people and their post-crash society much as Hollywood ' s Depression comedies did . It will be up to history to determine whether Mr. Greenberg ' s faith in the fundamental decency of his characters is as justified as Frank Capra ' s was . But that ' s our problem , not the author ' s . For anyone who has been waiting for a play that tells what it is like to be more or less middle-class , more or less young and more or less well-intentioned in a frightening city at this moment in this time zone , " Eastern Standard " at long last is it . <> <> TROUBLING CONTENT , BUBBLING FORM - EASTERN STANDARD , by Richard Greenberg ; directed by Michael Engler ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting by Dennis Parichy ; sound by Daniel Moses Schreier ; production stage manager , Pat Sosnow .
