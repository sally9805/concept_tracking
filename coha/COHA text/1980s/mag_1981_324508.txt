Warsaw buys time as peace breaks out on the labor front <P> In a red brick building at the University of Lodz , eleven student strike leaders and four government negotiators faced each other over two green cloth-covered tables . On one wall hung a six-foot white paper cross ; on the others posters bearing slogans of protest and defiance . At 4 p.m . Sociology Student Krzysztof Pakulski began to read a complicated agreement that had been hammered out and haggled over during two weeks of often hot-tempered negotiations , and which now signaled the end of a spreading student strike . When the accord was signed an hour later , triumphant cheers erupted from the 800 students assembled in the university auditorium . <P> Pakulski snatched the 45-page document from Higher Education Minister Janusz Gorski , jumped up on the table and waved it over his head like a captured battle flag . The strikers then picked up their sleeping bags , guitars and posters and peacefully left the building they had occupied for 28 days . " We have won , " declared Pakulski . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> So it seemed . Within hours of the Lodz settlement , sympathy strikes ended at the University of Warsaw and 19 other campuses . In the southeastern city of Rzeszw , meanwhile , a seven-week farmers ' sit-in ended after government negotiators signed agreements with peasant leaders there and in nearby Ustrzyki Dolne . Just seven days after the new Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski had issued his dramatic appeal for " 90 days of calm , " peace , it seemed , had broken out on all labor fronts . <P> Telegrams of support flowed into the new Premier 's office not only from party officials , but also from workers , students and local chapters of Solidarity , the in dependent union federation . The whole country seemed to realize that a campaign of cooperation was Poland 's last , best hope of consolidating its bold experiment in socialist " renewal " and avoiding the ultimate disaster of a Soviet invasion . Summing up the increasingly conciliatory national mood , Solidarity Spokesman Karol Modzelewski told the daily Zycie Warszawy that the new government " created a genuine chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But at what price ? In the Lodz agreement , the government granted a set of surprisingly far-reaching concessions to the students . Among them : the barring of police from campuses , a 30% student representation in each school 's administrative senate , the abolition of mandatory Russian language study and a reduction in the number of required Marxist-Leninist courses . Most important , the students were granted an independent union-thereby establishing yet another potential power center outside the Communist Party . <P> The students appeared to make only two major concessions in return : 1 ) a pledge that their union charter would declare allegiance to the Polish constitution , which enshrines the party 's leading role , and 2 ) a requirement that only those strikes approved by a majority of the student body would be considered legitimate . Referring to the whole student settlement package , one Western diplomat shook his head and said , " I just do n't see how the Soviets can accept that . "                  @ @ @
