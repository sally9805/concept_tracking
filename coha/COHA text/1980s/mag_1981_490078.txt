A REPORTER . AT LARGE JAll came to China for the first time on the afternoon of June 2nd , when the American bassist and French-horn player Willie Ruff introduced himself and his partner , the pianist Dwike Mitchell , to several hundred students and professors who were crowded into a large room at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music . The professors and the students were all expectant , without knowing quite what to expect . They knew only that they were about to hear the first American jazz concert ever presented to the Chinese . Probably they were not surprised to find that the two musi  --  cians were black , though black Ameri  --  cans are a rarity in the People 's Re  --  public . What they undoubtedly did n't expect was that Ruff would talk to them in Chinese , and when he began they murmured with delight . Ruff is a lithe , dapper man of fifty who takes visible pleasure in sharing his enthusiasms , and it was obvious that there was no place he would rather have been than in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people to still another country de  --  prived of that commodity . In 1959 , he and Mitchell  --  who have played to  --  gether as the Mitchell-Ruff Duo for twenty-six years  --  introduced jazz to SHANGHAI BLUES the Soviet Union , and for that occa  --  sion Ruff taught himself Russian , his seventh language . In 1979 , he hit on the idea of making a similar trip to China , and he began taking intensive courses in Chinese at Yale , where he is a professor of both music and Afro-American studies . By last winter , he felt he was fluent enough in Mandarin to make the trip . Now Ruff stood at the front of the room , holding several sheets of paper on which he had written , in Chinese characters , what he wanted to tell his listeners about the origins of jazz . He looked somewhat like an Oriental sage himself . " In the last three hun  --  dred and fifty years , black people in America have created a music that is a rich contribution to Western culture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years , compared to the long and distinguished history of Chinese music , seems like only a moment . But please remember that the music of American black people is an amalgam whose roots are deep in African his  --  tory , and that it has also taken many characteristics from the music of Eu  --  rope . " Ruff has an amiable voice , and as he spoke the men and women in the room were attentive but relaxed not an audience straining to decipher a foreigner 's accent . " In Africa , the drum is the most important musical instrument , " Ruff went on . " But to me the fascinating thing is that the people also use their drums to talk . Please imagine that the drum method of speech is so exquisite that Africans can , without recourse to words , recite proverbs , record history , arid send long messages . The drum is to West Afri  --  can society what the book is to literate society . " I wondered what the audience would make of that . Not only was China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Asian city that was encrusted with Western thought as transmitted in books , in journals , and in musical notation . Even the archi  --  tecture of Shanghai was a patchwork of Western shapes  --  a residue of the days when the city had a huge foreign population and was divided into dis  --  tricts that were controlled by different European countries . At the conserva  --  tory , we were in the former French concession , and its main building was in a red brick French Provincial style , with a sloping red tile roof and a porte cocliere . Another French-style build  --  ing housed the conservatory 's library of a hundred thousand books about music . Newer buildings served as classrooms and prac  --  tice rooms , and the music that eddied out of the windows was the dreary fare of West  --  ern academic rigor : vo  --  cal scales endlessly ris  --  ing , piano arpeggios repeated until they were mastered , cham  --  ber groups starting and stopping and starting again . We could have been in Vienna of the nineties or Paris of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way from Africa . And we were farther still from music created sponta  --  neously . " In the seventeenth century , when West Africans were cap  --  tured and brought to America as slaves , they brought their drums with them , " Ruff con  --  tinued . " But the slaveowners were afraid of the drum because it was so potent ; it could be used to incite the slaves to revolt . So they outlawed the drum . This very shrewd law had a tremendous effect on the development of black people 's mu  --  sic . Our ancestors had to develop a variety of drum substitutes . One of them , for example , was tap dancing  --  I 'm sure you 've all heard of that . Now I 'd like to show you another drum substitute that you probably do n't know about  --  one that uses the hands and the body to make rhythm . It 's called hambone . " There was no trans  --  lating " hambone " into Mandarin , but Ruff quickly had an intricate rhythm going to demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smacking his open mouth to create a series of resonating pops . Applause greeted this proof that the body could be its own drum . " By the time jazz started to develop , all African instruments in America had disappeared , " Ruff went on . " So jazz borrowed the instruments of Western music , like the ones that we 're playing here today . " He went over to his bass and showed how he used it as a percussion instrument by picking the strings with his fingers in  --  stead of playing them with a how . " Only this morning , " he said , " I gave a lesson to your distinguished professor of bass , and he is already very good . " Moving on from rhythm to terrain more familiar to his listeners , Ruff pointed out that jazz took its structural elements from European harmony . " Mr. Mitchell will now give you an example of the music that American slaves found in the Christian churches ? Protestant hymns that had been brought from Europe , " he said . " Slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please listen . " Mitchell played an old Protestant hymn . " The slaves adopted these harmonized melodies and trans  --  formed them into their own , very emotional spirituals , " Ruff said when Mitchell had finished . " Mr. Mitchell and I will sing you a famous Negro spiritual from the days of slavery . It 's called ' My Lord , What a Morning . ' " With Mitchell playing a joyful ac  --  companiment , the two men sang five or six choruses of the lovely old song , Mitchell carrying the melody in his deep voice , Ruff taking the higher , second part . The moment , musically beautiful , had an edge of faraway sad  --  ness . I could n't help thinking of an  --  other alien culture onto which the Protestant hymns of Europe had once been strenuously grafted . It was just beyond the conservatsry gates . " Mr. Mitchell will now show you how the piano can be used as a substi  --  tute for the instruments of the orches  --  tra , " Ruff said . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass and also to make his rhythm section . Later , he will use his right hand to play the main melody and to fill in the har  --  mony . This style is called ragtime . " Mitchell struck up a jaunty rag . The students perked up at the playful pat  --  tern of the notes . Ruff looked out at his class and beamed . The teacher in him was beginning to slip away ; the musician in him was telling him to start the concert . MITCHELL , and Ruff met in 1947 , when they were servicemen at Lockbourne Air Force Base , outside Columbus , Ohio . Mitchell , then sev  --  enteen and a pianist in the unit band , needed an accompanist , and he gave the newly arrived Ruff , a sixteen-year  --  old French-horn player , a crash course in playing the bass . Thus the duo was unofficially born . When they were discharged , they followed separate paths and lost contact . Mitchell went to the Philadelphia Musical Academy . Ruff went to the Yale School of Mu  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with his master 's degree in 1954 , lie was told that no American symphony orchestra would hire a black musician , and he accepted an offer to join the Tel Aviv Symphony as first French horn . Shortly before he was to leave , he happened to turn his television set on to " The Ed Sullivan Show . " Lionel Hampton 's orchestra was playing , and as the camera panned over to the piano Ruff saw a familiar figure at the key  --  board . Mitchell , it turned out , had been Hampton 's pianist for the past two years . Ruff telephoned him back  --  stage at the CBS studio . Mitchell hinted of imminent vacancies in the brass section . A few days later , Israel lost  --  and Hampton got  --  a superb French horn . The Mitchell-Ruff Duo ? " the old  --  est continuous group in jazz without personnel changes , " Ruff says  --  was formed in 1955 , when the two men left Hampton and struck out on their own . They were booked regularly by the major night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day : Louis Armstrong , Duke Ellington , Dizzy Gillespie , Miles Davis . " They were our mentors , " Ruff recalls . " They 'd play a set and then we 'd play a set and they 'd hang around and tell us what we could he doing better . We learned everything from those men . Count Basic 's band raised us . In 1956 , they were the hottest band in the country  --  they were the most expensive band and we were the cheapest  --  and we sold out Birdland every night . One eve  --  ning , Miles Davis brought Billie Hol  --  iday in to hear us , and we just about fell through the floor . We were still just kids . " Meanwhile , they caught the atten  --  tion of another set of patrons  --  a group of older women in New York who had formed an organization called Young Audiences to introduce elementary- and high-school students to chamber music . For teachers , the women chose young professionals who could communicate with words as well as with music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach jazz . Ruff recalls , " It was done under the supervision of the founders  --  Mrs. Lionello Perera , a great patron of music , and Mrs. Edgar Leventritt , who started the Leventritt Competi  --  tion  --  and Nina Collier and several other ladies who sat on the board . They taught us definite techniques , such as how to catch the attention of children , and they also gave us lessons in grooming and enunciation and con  --  duct . They were very stern and really quite unpleasant , but instructive . Ev  --  erything they told us turned out to be true . " Armed with these graces , Mitchell and Ruff hit the road for Young Audiences , often giving seven or eight performances a day , going from school to school , first in New York and later in Boston , Baltimore , and San Fran  --  cisco . They did a tour of Indian schools in New Mexico . The duo al  --  ternated these forays with its stands in Manhattan clubs . Then , in 1959 , it went to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Department , which had been try  --  ing for two years to get Louis Arm  --  strong into the Soviet Union , declined to help . In Russia , the two Americans found a thirst for jazz that surprised even them ; when they left Moscow , nine hundred people came to the sta  --  tion to see them off . Mitchell , in turn , still remembers being moved by Rus  --  sian songs that resembled spirituals he had heard in the black churches of his boyhood . Whether a scholar could find any such link does n't matter to him ; in music , he operates on an emotional level that has no need for evidence . " I felt a mysterious bond between their people and my people , " he says . " I think I connected with their suffer  --  ing . " Not long after that trip , the house of jazz began to crumble . Television was the new medium and rock the new musical message . " Night clubs started closing in the very early sixties , " Ruff recalls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , or just disappeared was astounding . Many of them moved to Europe . Three of the greatest rhythm players  --  Oscar Pettiford , Bud Powell , and Kenny Clarke  --  had been living in Paris and playing for peanuts because they could n't find any work in the United States . How devastating it was for us to play in Europe  --  as we did quite a hit then  --  and see so many of these great men so reduced ! " Mitchell and Ruff survived because of their teaching bent , They caught the attention of two venerable booking agencies , Pryor-Menz and Alkahest , that wanted a young act to give con  --  certs for college audiences and also explain the music , and thereby found the format  --  sixty or seventy concerts a year , mainly at colleges  --  that has been their principal source of income to this day . A new tool came their way in 1967 , when CBS Television sent them to Brazil to make a one-hour film tracing the African roots of Brazilian music . Ruff recognized the value of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study film , and has since visited Bali , Senegal , and the pygmies of the Central African Republic to make films about the drum music and lan  --  guage of those societies . He always came back to Yale ( where he and I lived in the same college ) elated by new rhythmical affinities that he had found among diverse cultures and among seemingly unrelated forms of life . His seminars on rhythm began to make startling connections as he brought Yale professors into them from such disciplines as neurology , limnology , geology , art , English , as  --  tronomy , physiology , and physics . The professors , in fact , became almost as elated as Ruff . WE flew to Shanghai on a Chinese 747 ? Ruff walked up and down the aisles trying out his Chinese on the passengers  --  and the next day we called on Professor Tan Shu-chen , deputy director of the Shanghai Con  --  servatory of Music , who was , so far , our only contact . Two years ago , Ruff had sought the sponsorship of the Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sending American musicians to China , but he got no response . Ruff felt that no matter how many great American artists went to China  --  Isaac Stern , the Boston Symphony Orchestra , Ro  --  berta Peters  --  the music that they played and sang would he European music . The indigenous music of America was jazz , and the Chinese had never heard it in a live per  --  formance . ( When Ruff asked a Chi  --  nese man on the plane whether his people were familiar with jazz , he said , " Oh , yes , we know Stephen Foster very well . " ) Lacking official support , Ruff decided to go anyway . He booked himself and Mitchell on a two-week tour to Shanghai and Peking , the two cities that had major conservatories , and then went looking for money . He got a grant from Coca-Cola that would cover their expenses and the costs of filming their visit . To have Professor Tan as our host was all that we could have asked . He had come to New York last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mozart  --  Isaac Stern in China , " in which he describes his imprisonment during China 's Cultural Revolution . Ruff invited him to visit the Yak School of Music , in the long-range hope of fostering some kind of collabo  --  ration that would help both insti  --  tutions  --  an exchange of teachers or students or manuscripts between Yale and the Shanghai Conservatory , for instance . ' While Professor Tan was at Yale , he attended a class in which Ruff and Mitchell were play  --  ing , and he invited them , in turn , to give a concert at the conservatory . That was all that a born improviser needed to hear . Now we were at the conservatory , and Professor Tan was showing us around . He had ar  --  ranged the jazz concert for the next afternoon . The Shanghai Conservatory of Music , which was founded in 1927 , and which prides itself on being part of the cultural conscience of China , has six hundred and fifty students  --  the youngest are eight years old  --  and three hundred teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few are from Shanghai , but a large number are recruited from all over China by faculty members , who hold regional auditions . The conservatory has five depart  --  ments of instruction  --  piano ; voice ; strings and winds ; composing and conducting ; and traditional Chinese instruments  --  and two of musicology . One of these is a musical-research in  --  stitute . The other , devoted to Chinese traditional and folk music , was re  --  cently formed to broaden the conser  --  vatory 's involvement with the heritage of its own country . But the tilt is definitely Westward . Most of the con  --  servatory 's original teachers were Europeans , and Many of its graduates have lived in the West and won recog  --  nition there . The curriculum , from what I could hear of it , was rooted in Europe : Bach , Scarlatti , Mozart , Bee  --  thoven , Brahms , Schubert , Chopin , Verdi . The biggest class that we saw consisted of a forty-piece student orchestra , led by a student conductor , playing Dvoi-ak 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition  --  and was one of its first ca  --  sualties when the Cultural Revolution struck . He was born in 1907 , and as a boy he studied violin privately with Dutch and Italian teachers who were living in China . When he joined the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra , in 1927 , he was its first Chinese member . He recalls the conductor , an Italian named Mario Paci , as a man of such fierce temper that he constantly broke his baton . Thus he learned at an ear  --  ly age that one of the liveliest cur  --  rents running through Western mu  --  sic is high emotion among its practi  --  tioners . Professor Tan turned to teaching in 1929 ? at one point , he was teaching violin at six different colleges in Shanghai and rejoined the symphony in 1937 . By that time , it had four Chinese members ; obviously , Shanghai was still a creature of the West . But that era would soon come to an end . During the Second World War , the Japanese occupied Shanghai , foreigners were interned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West was finally broken . It was no time or place for a musi  --  cian to make a living ? " One month 's salary would buy one shoe , " Professor Tan recalled  --  and , seeking a more practical trade , he went to architecture school and earned his degree . He re  --  turned to music after the war , how  --  ever , joining the Shanghai Conser  --  vatory in 1947 , and becoming its deputy director in 1949 , when the Communists came to power in China . The school then began its biggest era of growth . The student body and the faculty were greatly expanded , and European music regained its hold . But the older students were also required to go away and work for three months every year on farms and in factories . " The peasants and workers disliked Western music because it belonged to the rich people , " Professor Tan recalled . " And our students could n't practice much , because they met so much criticism . At the conservatory , we never knew where we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relaxation . It was an uneasy time . In fact , just before the Cultural Revolution I was thinking of retiring from teaching . I had a sense of a com  --  ing storm . We are like animals  --  we can feel that . " The storm broke on June 5 , 1966 . The first winds of the Cultural Revo  --  lution hit the conservatory front within . " On the first day , posters were put up and meetings were held de  --  nouncing the director , Professor Ho Lu-ting , " Professor Tan said . " The next day , the attack was aimed at me . I was accused of poisoning the minds of the students . My crime was that I was teaching Mozart . I happen to be a blind admirer of European and American people and music and cul  --  ture , so everything I had been teach  --  ing was poison . Bach and Beethoven were poison . And Brahms . And Paga  --  nini . " At first , it was only posters and meetings . Then the conservatory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were beaten every day by students and by young people who came in from outside . Boys of ten or eleven would throw stones at us . They really believed we were bad people  --  especially any professor who was over forty . The older you were , the worse you were . For a year , more than a hundred of us older teachers were beaten and forced to spend every day shut up together in a dosed shed . Then there was a year when we had to do hard labor . Ten professors died from the strain ; one of them had a heart attack when a young guard made him run after him for a mile . Ile just dropped dead at the end . Then came the solitary confinement . Our di  --  rector was kept in prison , in chains , for five years . I was put in the worst room they could find here  --  a very small room in the basement , hard  --  ly any bigger than my bed . It had no light and no windows , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was nothing to do to pass the time . I was kept there for four  --  teen months . " ? crimes , " but he still had to do physi  --  cal labor at the conservatory during the day . Needless to say , no Western music was played there . Finally , in 1976 , the Gang of Four was over  --  thrown , the professors were declared innocent , and the conservatory was re  --  opened . Professor Tan told me that among the students he readmitted were some who had beaten and tor  --  mented him . I said that I could hardly imagine such forbearance . " I did n't think about that , " he said . " The past is the past . " Professor Tan is a small , gentle man with white hair and a modest manner . He dresses in the informal work clothes that everybody wears in Shanghai ; nobody would take him for one of the city 's cultural eminences . He moves somewhat slowly and wears fairly strong glasses  --  marks , perhaps , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress since 1976 , because now they can play wholeheartedly , " he told me . " I love being able to teach the violin again . It 's such an enjoyment to hear people who are truly talented . Yesterday , a girl played the ' Scottish Fantasy ' of Max Bruch , and although I was sup  --  posed to be teaching her , I only sat and listened and never said a word . It was just right . " He was equally pleased by the thought of bringing jazz to his students . " I 've never seen any jazz musicians in China , " he said . " Nobody here knows anything about jazz . When I heard Mr. Ruff and Mr. Mitchell play at Yale , I realized that it was very important music . I wanted my teachers and my students to hear it . I wanted them to know what real American jazz is like . " WHEN Mitchell finished his rag- time tune , the audience clapped ? apparently glad to hear some of the converging elements that Ruff had talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you an example of blues , " Ruff said . " Blues " was another word that did n't lend itself to Mandarin , and it sounded unusually strung out : " bl00000ze . " Ruff continued , " One of the fundamental principles of jazz is form , and blues are a perfect illus  --  tration . Blues almost always have a twelve-bar form . This twelve-bar form never changes . It would n't change even if we stayed here and played it all night . " He paused to let this sink in . " But you do n't have to worry  --  we are n't going to play it that long . " It was his first joke in Chinese , and it went over well . Mitchell then played an easygoing blues  --  a classic sample of what came up the river from New Orleans , with a strong left hand ornamented by graceful runs in the right hand . Ruff joined in on bass , and they played several twelve-bar choruses . After that number , Ruff brought up the matter of improvisation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that when he was young he had wor  --  ried because his people had n't devel  --  oped from their experience in America a written tradition of opera , like Chi  --  nese opera , that chronicled great or romantic events . " But later I stopped worrying , because I saw that the mas  --  ter performers of our musical story  --  Louis Armstrong , Ella Fitzgerald , and so many others -- have enriched our culture with the beauty of what they created spontaneously . Now please listen one more time to the blues form , and count the measures along with me . " He wanted his listeners to count , he said , because the rules of jazz require the improviser , however wild his melodic journeys , to repeat the harmonic changes that went into the first statement of the theme . " After you count with me a few times through , Mr. Mitchell will begin one of his famous improvisations , " Ruff said . Mitchell played a simple blues theme , emphasizing the chord changes , and Ruff counted the twelve bars aloud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly , and this time Ruff counted in Chinese : " Yi , er , san , si , ton , liu , ( I ; ha . . . " This so delighted the students that they forgot to join him . " I ca n't hear you , " Ruff said , teacher-fashion , but they kept quiet and enjoyed his climb up the numerical ladder . After  --  ward , Mitchell embarked on a series of dazzling improvisations , some con  --  structed of runs like those played by Art Tatum , some built on strong chord progressions ( he can move im  --  mense chord clusters up and down the keyboard with incredible speed ) ; next , Ruff took a chorus on the bass ; then they alternated their improvised flights , moving in twelve-bar segments to an ending that seemed inevitable  --  as if they had played it a hundred times before . Changing the mood , Ruff an  --  nounced that Mitchell would play " Yesterdays . " Jerome Kern 's plaintive melody is hardly the stuff of tradi  --  tional jazz , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of classical in  --  tricacy , closer to Rachmaninoff ( one of his heroes ) than to any jazz pianist . The students applauded with fervor . Staying in a relatively classical vein , Ruff switched to the French horn , and the two men played Billy Strayhorn 's " Lush Life " in a vein that was slow and lyrical , almost like a German lied , and that perhaps surprised the students with its lack of an obvious rhythm . The next number was one that I did n't recognize . It moved at a bright tempo and had several engaging themes that were brought back by the piano or the French horn  --  the usual jazzmen 's game of statement and re  --  sponse . Twice , Mitchell briefly intro  --  duced a contrapuntal motif that was a deliberate imitation of Bach , and each time it drew a ripple of amusement from the professors and the students . It was the first time they had heard a kind of music that they recognized from their own studies . " That number is called ' Shanghai Blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just made it up . " The audience buzzed with amazement and pleasure . I had been watching the professors and the students closely during the concert . Their faces had the look of people watching the slow approach of some great natural force  --  a tornado or a tidal wave . They had been listen  --  ing to music that their experience had not prepared them to understand . Two black men were playing long stretches of music without resorting to any printed notes . Yet they obviously had n't memorized what they were playing ; their music took unexpected turns , seemingly at the whim of the musicians , straying all over the key  --  board and all over the landscape of Western tonality . Nevertheless , there was order . Themes that had been abandoned came back in different clothes . If the key changed , as it fre  --  quently did , the two men were always in the same key . Often there was a playfulness between the two instru  --  ments , and always there was rapport . But if the two players were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick for the untrained eye . I could tell that the music was hold  --  ing the Chinese listeners in a strong grip . Their minds seemed to be fully engaged . Their bodies , however , were not . Only three pairs of feet in the whole room were tapping  --  Ruff 's , Mitchell 's , and mine . Perhaps this was a Chinese characteristic , this stillness of listening . Moreover , the music was n't easy . It never again approached the overt syncopation of the ragtime that Mitchell had played early in the program ; that was where the essential gaiety of jazz had been most accessible . Nor did it have the flat-out gusto that an earlier generation of black musi  --  cians might have brought to China  --  the thumping rhythms and simpler harmonies of a James P. Johnson or a Fats Waller . It was not that Mitchell and Ruff were playing jazz that was pedantic or sedate . On the contrary , I have seldom heard Mitchell play with more exuberant shifts of energy and mood . But the music was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz would have been charmed by its intelligence and wit . I had to remind myself that the Chinese had heard no Western music of any kind from 1966 to 1976 . A twenty-one-year-old stu  --  dent in the audience , for instance , would have begun to listen to compos  --  ers like Mozart and Brahms only within the past five years . The jazz that he was hearing now was not so different as to be a whole new branch of music . Mitchell was clearly grounded in Bach and Chopin ; Ruff 's French horn had echoes of all the classical works  --  Debussy 's " Reverie , " Ravel 's " Pavane " ? in which that instrument has such uncanny power to move us . After " Shanghai Blues , " Ruff asked for questions . " Where do people go to study jazz in America ? " a student wanted to know . " What kind of courses do they take ? " Ruff explained that jazz courses , where they existed at all , would be part of a broad college curriculum that included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , really , jazz is n't learned in universities or conservato  --  ries , " he said . " It 's music that is passed on by older musicians to those of us who are younger . " It was not a helpful answer . What kind of subject did n't have its own academy ? A shyness settled over the room , though the students seemed full of curiosity . Professor Tan got up and stood next to Ruff . " I urge you to ask questions , " he said . " I can assure you that jazz has many principles that ap  --  ply to your studies here . In fact , I have many questions myself . " An old professor stood up and asked , " When you created the ' Shanghai Blues ' just now , did you have a form for it , or a logical plan ? " " I just started tapping my foot , " Ruff replied , tapping his foot to recon  --  struct the moment . " And then I started to play the Erg thought that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he an  --  swered . And after that we heard and answered , heard and answered , heard and answered . " " We never can , " Ruff replied . " That is beyond our imagination , " the professor said . " Our students here play a piece a hundred times , or two hundred times , to get it exactly right . You play something once  --  something very beautiful  --  and then you just throw it away . " Now the questions tumbled out . What was most on the students ' minds quickly became clear : it was the mys  --  tery of improvisation . ( The Chinese do n't even have a word for improvi  --  sation of this kind ; Ruff translated it as " something created during the pro  --  cess of delivery . " ) All the questions poked at this central riddle ? " Could a Chinese person improvise ? " and " Could two strangers improvise to  --  gether ? " and " How can you compose at such speed ? " and during this period Ruff took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all on our ear . Was it really possible , a student wanted to know , to improvise on any tune at all  --  even one that the musi  --  cians had never heard before ? Ruff 's reply was casual . " I would like to invite one of the pianists here to play a short traditional Chinese mel  --  ody that I 'm sure we would not know , and we will make a new piece based on that , " he said . The room erupted in oohs and cheers . I caught a look on Mitchell 's face that said , " This time you 've gone wanted to have play . When they found him in the crowd , he was so diffident that he got down on the floor to keep from being dragged out . But his friends dragged him out anyway , and , regaining his aplomb , he walked to the piano and sat down with the formality of a concert artist . He was about twenty-two . Mitchell stood to one side , looking grave . The young man played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be his own composition , un  --  known to the other people . It began with four chords of distinctively Chi  --  nese structure , moved down the scale in a stately progression , paused , turned itself around with a transitional figure of lighter weight , and then started back up , never repeating itself and finally resolving the theme with a suspended chord that was satisfying be  --  cause it was so unexpected . It was a perfect small piece , about fourteen bars long . The student walked back to his seat , and Mitchell went back to the piano . The room grew quiet . Mitchell 's huge hands hovered briefly over the keys , and then the young man 's melody came back to him . It was in the same key ; it had the same chords , slightly embellished near the end ; and , best of all , it had the same mood . Having stated the theme , Mitchell broadened it the second time , giving it a certain majesty , coloring the student 's chords with dissonances that were entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still preserved their mood . Then Ruff joined him on his bass , and they took the melody through a number of vari  --  ations , Mitchell giving it a whole se  --  ries of new lives but never losing its integrity . I listened to his feat with growing excitement . For me , it was the climax of years of marvelling at his ear and at his sensitivity to the material at hand . The students were equally elated and astonished . For them , it was the ultimate proof  --  be  --  cause it touched their own heritage  --  that for a jazz , improviser no point of departure is alien . After that number , a few more ques  --  tions were asked , and Mitchell and Ruff concluded with a Gershwin med  --  ley from " Porgy and Bess " and a ge  --  nial rendition of " My Old Flame . " Professor Tan thanked the two men and formally ended the concert . Then he went over to Mitchell and took his hands in his own . " You are an artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought Ruff had given him an unduly nervous moment when he invited the students to supply a melody . " Well , naturally I was nervous , be  --  cause I did n't have any idea what to expect , " he said . " But , you know , that boy phrased his piece perfectly . The minute he started to play , I got his emotions . I understood exactly what he was feeling , and the rest was easy . The notes and the chords just fell into place . " ?
