Imreg Inc. ' s stock has soared the past year on excitement about its efforts to develop a drug to combat AIDS . But some medical and investment professionals see grounds for caution . Last month , Imreg announced it had completed the third and most comprehensive clinical trial of its drug Imreg-1 , on 158 patients . In tests at medical centers , 102 patients received the drug and 56 received a placebo . The drug was " associated with a reduced risk of progression to AIDS , " the company said . A New York physician connected with the trials further stated that the drug appeared to slow or prevent the development of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , an infection most commonly connected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Researchers familiar with the drug say it is one of almost a half dozen drugs that hold promise for prolonging life in AIDS patients . However , it isn ' t designed to cure AIDS nor should it be perceived as a way to stop progress of the disease outright . Beyond a few carefully worded news releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the drug or provide detailed data about its three trials . Departing from common scientific practice , they haven ' t submitted papers to scientific journals for peer review . Officials at Bethesda , Md. ' s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said they are unable to determine the effectiveness of Imreg-1 because the company has failed to provide adequate data . At about $15 a share , Imreg has a market valuation of $160 million . While high valuations are not uncommon to the biotechnology business , the valuation is considered steep for Imreg , a one-product company with no revenue to date and losses totaling $8. 7 million in its past six years . By contrast , Immunex , which plans to have 10 products in clinical trials by June , has a market valuation of only $90 million . GM-CSF , one of the products being tested by Immunex , is also viewed by the medical community as a possible treatment for AIDS patients . Still , Imreg has picked up a loyal , almost fanatical following . In January , when Imreg stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying it because " this is a single-digit stock that , in my opinion , has possibilities of evolving into a triple-digit stock . " Mr. Garcia , who follows the company for Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , in New Orleans , estimates that in full production Imreg-1 could easily generate gross profits in excess of $600 million a year or about $59 a share for the company . Shyamal Ghosh of Ivy Securities in Houston is more tempered in his optimism but is convinced the stock could easily reach $50 a share if the drug receives Food and Drug Administration approval . Both analysts expect FDA approval by year end , even as early as fall . Bears scoff at such optimism . The size of the tests and the nature of the results don ' t warrant immediate FDA approval , according to James McCamant , editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter , who has often been short on the stock . He and others question how many actual AIDS patients were involved in the trial , as opposed to those with AIDS-related complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out Imreg-1 ' s latest trial involved only 158 patients  --  in contrast to the 282 patients in Burroughs Wellcome Co. ' s final , Phase III trials for its AZT drug . " It is inconceivable to us that Imreg  --  a company without any track record  --  would be accorded fast-track status with half the number of Phase III patients , " Mr. Weisbrod says . The Prudential-Bache analyst is also bothered that Imreg has stonewalled analysts and the media about its drug and has refused to publish detailed reports about the trials . " The FDA likes to see articles on drugs it has to approve . In the Imreg case , it hasn ' t seen any , " Mr. Weisbrod says . He contrasts the mystery surrounding Imreg-1 to the widespread publicity given to AZT . " In AZT , Burroughs was up front about it ; we saw all the data . Here , we have to take Art Gottlieb ' s word for it , " Mr. Weisbrod complains . Timothy Rice of Johnson , Rice &; Co. , a New Orleans brokerage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major pharmaceutical company to establish credibility . " Such an agreement would also bring much-needed cash , " Mr. Rice says . Although Dr. Gottlieb has mentioned ongoing discussions with pharmaceutical companies and others as steps to a possible joint venture or licensing agreement for the past three years , none has yet materialized . This isn ' t the first time controversy has surrounded a pharmaceutical company with a potential AIDS treatment . Last year , ICN Pharmaceuticals triumphantly announced that its Viratek affiliate had found that its drug ribavirin was effective in protecting patients with early AIDS symptoms . Later , however , the FDA didn ' t approve wider use of the drug because it didn ' t find the studies convincing . " We don ' t want to say anything that is incomplete or can be misconstrued in such a charged environment , " says Dr. Gottlieb of Imreg . " We felt it was in the company ' s best interest not to disclose the components of the drug until patents were issued ( in July 1987 ) , " he explains . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We don ' t want to repeat the ICN-Viratek mistake. "
