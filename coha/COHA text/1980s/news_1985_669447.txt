But the logos of New York or West Coast banking powerhouses - Citibank , Chase Manhattan , Bank of America - are not going to dominate the lives of Americans. // At least , not now. // In many areas of the United States , however , you ' ll be noticing more signs of banks from neighboring states . This is because regional interstate banking appears to be the chosen path , according to two recent court decisions. // // Although both marketplace and banking forces will continue pushing for nationwide banking , for now Easterners will be seeing more branches of banks based in Boston ; Hartford , Conn. ; or New York - besides their local banks . A Southerner might notice more branches from Atlanta ; Orlando , Fla . ; Richmond , Va . In the West , the logos of San Francisco , Los Angeles , and Seattle banks may predominate . In the middle of the country , however , where states appear to be holding to themselves , banking may look much the same as it is now. // Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutionality of regional banking compacts . The ruling was a blow to expansion-minded money-center banks . The court cited states ' rights and the long national tradition of community control of banking. // The ruling came close on the heels of a May 21 finding by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals in Atlanta that chartering so-called ' ' nonbank banks ' ' across state lines violated the intent of Congress . The ' ' nonbanks , ' ' also known as limited-service or consumer banks , had hitherto slipped through a loophole in federal bank law which defined commercial banks as institutions that accepted demand deposits and made commercial loans. // By shunning commercial loan making , the nonbank banks had avoided the restrictions otherwise visited upon bank holding companies , and these operations looked to be the shortcut the nation ' s money-center banks were going to use to find their way to Main Street. // The Atlanta ruling spawned headlines along the lines of ' ' Back to Square 1 on interstate banking . ' ' But the two decisions , seen together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDermott Jr. , research director at Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods in New York . ' ' Congress and the Federal Reserve have indicated a lack of enthusiasm for limited-service banks , ' ' he says , adding that only the comptroller of the currency has evinced any real enthusiasm for them . With 14 , 000 banks , 3 , 100 savings-and-loans , and 18 , 000 credit unions in the nation , Mr. McDermott asks , ' ' what do we need limited-service banks for ? ' ' // The two court decisions show ' ' that limited-service banks are not the way for geographic expansion , and that regional compacts are the way to go , ' ' McDermott adds . <> <> Sanctioning the status quo // There was another important development on the banking front last week : The House Banking Committee , by a 31-to-18 vote , approved a bill that recognizes the regional compacts but that would require states involved in these compacts to let in banks from throughout the nation after five years. // The five-year period would allow regional banks to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide interstate banking becomes a reality. // In a sense , this legislation would merely put the stamp of congressional approval on the status quo . It would also allow states to ' ' opt out ' ' of interstate banking . States that had not passed interstate banking laws or entered into any regional compacts would not be forced to let in Citicorp or any of its money-center brethren. // On the other hand , Lynn Fox , legislative aide to Rep. John Jr . LaFalce ( D ) of New York , who led the fight for the interstate bill in committee , says the legislation goes ' ' beyond the marketplace ' ' in three important ways : // // * It states that regional compacts are acceptable only as a transition to full interstate banking . ' ' The problem with regional compacts is not their existence but their existence indefinitely. ' ' // // * The bill addresses the problem of ' ' undue concentration of resources , ' ' i. e. , the antitrust question , by prohibiting any bank with more than 1 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than $100 million in deposits , except to bail out a struggling bank. // // * The bill would require banks wanting to move across state lines to document how they plan to meet the needs of ' ' underserved communities ' ' and poor people in the new territory. // McDermott , however , warns against ' ' reading too much ' ' into the committee vote , and another congressional aide says , ' ' It ' s got a ways to go yet. ' ' // Indeed , Sen. Jake Garn ( R ) of Utah , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , said last week , ' ' I certainly see no need to have an interstate banking title in our bill at all , ' ' referring to separate Senate legislation on which hearings have been under way. // On the other hand , Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III endorsed the House bill , noting , ' ' The administration is not convinced that size is inherently bad or that current antitrust laws are inadequate to deal with concerns about undue concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference // Still , the two court rulings may have taken the wind out of the sails of national legislation. // In the Southeast , particularly , where a number of states have passed regional compacts , the Supreme Court decision has separated those bankers who have favored regionalism as the final destination from those who have seen them as a mere wayside stop. // The ' ' national trigger ' ' issue has been hugely controversial within the banking industry , and one congressional aide expresses surprise that the provision survived the committee vote . ' ' A couple of months ago , few were betting on a national trigger. ' ' // Rep. Doug Barnard Jr . ( D ) of Georgia led a fight in the Banking Committee for a longer trigger period and was defeated . ' ' Five years from now the deals will be done - the marketplace moves too rapidly , ' ' says Ms. Fox. // Fritz Elmendorf , a spokesman for the American Bankers Association , notes that ' ' before the Supreme Court ruling , most bankers had something they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elmendorf says , had ' ' something for everyone ' ' - that is , endorsement of the regional compact , the five-year ' ' national trigger , ' ' the ' ' opt out ' ' provision for states that don ' t want to get involved , and the closing of the nonbank loophole . So ' ' there was a lot of forward momentum for all those reasons. ' ' // Nevertheless , the two court decisions put the damper on this legislation. // Fox warns that regional ' ' oligopolies ' ' could develop if there is no national trigger . These , she says , could be more detrimental to the banking industry than the sort of freewheeling competition that would occur with full nationwide interstate banking. // Banking consultant David C. Cates , in New York , says the nation ' s banks don ' t have much to fear from Citicorp and other giants . ' ' They ' re kind of a paper tiger , ' ' he says , noting that they tend to be more highly leveraged than regional banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for pretty steep prices , which means there is a dilutive effect on the purchasing bank ' s stock. // Differing strategies // Not all the money-center banks , moreover , have the same acquisition strategy. // BankAmerica in San Francisco is streamlining its operations up and down the West Coast . ' ' We do not see the Supreme Court ruling having much effect on our plans . . . . We have not been an aggressive pusher of interstate banking , ' ' a spokesman says. // But in Los Angeles , J. J. Pinola , chief executive of First Interstate Bancorp , says that while the Supreme Court ruling ' ' did not come as a major surprise - states ' rights is one of those things like motherhood - it was terribly disappointing. ' ' // He is also unhappy with the House ' s interstate banking bill : First Interstate , which owns banks in 11 Western states - an arrangement that predates the current law restricting cross-border bank ownership - would be limited to acquiring only banks under $100 million in deposits . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Consultant Cates concurs . ' ' I think it is a mistake to exclude New York banks , from a public-policy perspective . ' ' Not only are these banks ' ' a crucial national resource , ' ' but they need room to spread out . It would be good , Mr. Cates says , for them to ' ' acquire a core customer base . It would be good for their customers to have aggressive New York-style competition , and it would be good for shareholders to have the New York option. ' ' // // // //
