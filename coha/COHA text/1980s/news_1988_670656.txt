" Although medical science has been able to increase our life expectancy to 75-plus years , our knees are only capable of withstanding about 35 to 40 years of use and abuse , " said Dr. Stuart I. Springer , an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Joint Diseases ' Orthopedic Institute in New York . Thereafter , they start to fall apart as the ligaments and tendons that hold the joint together weaken and stretch , and the cartilage that cushions the contact between bones deteriorates . The too-frequent result is pain and limitation of movement. // Dr. Springer says that when you consider how many thousands of times a week " we flex , rotate , pivot , extend , shift , lean , walk , run , jump , kneel and generally abuse " our knees , and add to that " the abuse of years of football , baseball , tennis , skiing , jogging , dancing and other physical stresses , it ' s amazing they last as long as they do. " // While the most dramatic knee injuries tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the average person , spring is the start of knee season . The resurgence of gardening , golf , spring cleaning , cycling , tennis , jogging and even swimming and walking can cause a nagging pain in the knees. // Dr. James M. Fox , an orthopedic surgeon in Van Nuys , Calif. , estimates that about 50 million Americans have experienced a knee injury or knee pain . This is in addition to the many who frequently hear clicks in their knees , which are usually insignificant unless accompanied by pain. // Most of us can prevent or postpone problems that eventually cause chronic or recurrent pain , forcing us to curtail activities before the rest of the body is ready to turn in the towel . Whether you are an avid exerciser or sedentary soul , whether you are young or past your prime , your knees are vulnerable to deterioration . <> <> The Vulnerable Joint // It may help motivate you if you understand the fragility of the structure . The knee is a poorly constructed joint ; it is , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held together with fat rubber bands . Its basic design was in place long before animals stood on two feet , an evolutionary advance that exposed the knee to impact injuries and to the concentrated forces of body weight and motion. // " Almost everything people do for recreation is tough on the knee , " said Dr. Fox , who wrote the new book " Save Your Knees " ( Dell , $6. 95 ) , with Rick McGuire . " Even simple day-to-day living - kneeling , walking , climbing and being crossed while at rest - can take a toll over time. " // The knee was primarily designed to permit flexion and extension of the leg as in walking , sitting and standing . While the knee can also rotate slightly from side to side , its range is limited by ligaments . However , the ligaments - those rubber bands that hold the joint together - are not tough enough to withstand every extreme or abrupt twist and turn. // The padding of cartilage between the bones can also be damaged , especially when forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , by years of jogging. // Then there ' s the kneecap , or patella , which can slip out of its track or suffer impact injuries , and its supporting tendons , which may tear or become inflamed after excessive jumping or running , especially on an unyielding surface . <> <> How to Save the Knees // Dr. Fox offers the following suggestions for maintaining healthy knees : // If you are overweight , try to shed pounds , especially if you participate in activities like jogging or tennis. // Avoid a lot of squatting and excessive climbing of stairs , which puts a force four to seven times your weight across the knee cap . The stress between kneecap and thigh can exceed 2 , 000 pounds when you stand up . If you must work below your waist , pull up a stool or sit on the floor. // If you garden , get a foam cushion to kneel on and shift your weight frequently . Periodically , sit down on the ground to work , but again , change your leg position often. // Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The most encouraging boon to knee joints in walking cities has been the number of women who wear walking shoes to work and brown-bag their high heels , " Dr. Fox said . Walking shoes should be well-cushioned , especially at the heel , and not overly stretched. // When forced to sit for a long time , keep changing position . Cross and uncross your legs , slide forward in your seat , stretch your legs and , whenever possible , get up and walk around every 35 or 40 minutes. // Seek a resilient surface if you regularly pursue such activities as jogging , fast walking , high-impact aerobics , tennis and jumping rope . Concrete or wood over concrete absorbs none of the impact , which is transfered back to the legs and knees . Nearly a third of runners can expect to develop a dull , aching pain under or around the kneecap . Arch supports or orthotics , molded shoe inserts , can help correct alignment problems that result in excessive stress on knees. // Swimmers should avoid the whip kick used in the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmers should use fins , which force the muscles of the thighs and buttocks to do the work , relieving stress on the knees. // Cyclists should set the seat so that the knee is slightly bent when the leg is extended to the pedals . Avoid cycling in high gears , which causes undue stress when peddling up an incline or riding into the wind. // If you do fast walking , be aware that hyperextending your legs - straightening them to an abnormal degree - stretches tendons in back of the knee and may result in a chronic ache . In normal walking and running , the knees are always slightly bent. // Seek balanced strength in thigh muscles , which can help protect the knee from injuries caused by extreme forces . Runners tend to have disproportionately strong hamstring muscles in back of the thighs and cyclists overdevelop the quadriceps in front of the thighs . Ideally , these activities should be alternated. // Do gentle sustained stretching as part of your warm-up and cool-down . Do not bounce when you stretch ; this is counterproductive . Rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ballet dancer or gymnast , avoid stretches that involve raising one leg at a time to shoulder height. // If you are out of condition , do not plunge into vigorous , knee-straining activity without reconditioning your thigh muscles . Then slowly increase the rigors of your workout . Even if in top form , avoid abrupt increases in speed or duration . And keep in mind that if you are middle-aged and just starting to exercise , you may already have arthritic degeneration of your knees , which could be worsened by failing to condition muscles first. // If your knee suddenly starts to hurt in an activity , stop what you are doing . Do not try to work through the pain . Chances are you will compound the damage . Rather , follow a first-aid regimen known by the acronym RICE : Rest , get off your feet . Ice the knee . Apply compressions , wrapping the knee gently . Elevate the leg . <> <> When to See the Doctor // If first aid does not result in rapid improvement , a medical visit may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician immediately if you feel numbness or tingling in your toes or feet. // In addition , see your doctor promptly if the knee is painful or swollen or if you can feel something moving abnormally inside the knee . You should also check with a physician if you heard a " pop " inside the knee when the injury occurred. //
