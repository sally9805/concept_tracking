, Residents of the Edgewood Independent school district , a poor , largely Hispanic area in west San Antonio , are willing to pay for good schools . Property taxes are high  --  almost $1 per $100 of assessed valuation . But because the district encompasses part of a tax-exempt Air Force base and lacks tony subdivisions , the tax rate translates into $3,596 per student . In the Santa Gertrude school district , located on the oil-rich King Ranch in south Texas , property taxes are low  --  only 8 cents per $100 of assessed valuation  --  but the total spent per student is $12,000 . <P> Disparities such as these prompted the Texas Supreme Court last week to declare the state 's method of school finance unconstitutional . In a 9-to-0 decision , the court said the wide gaps between the richest and the poorest of Texas ' 1,071 districts violate a provision of the state constitution requiring an " efficient " education . Funneling resources to poorer districts would reduce some of these differences . But money alone is not enough .

" <P> The Texas decision , which affects the nation 's second largest school system after California , is sure to breathe new life into the struggle for more uniform school financing around the country . But by calling for a basic shift in the way schools operate , the court changed the terms of the debate , emphasizing that inequities in funding are linked to inequities in the quality of education . <P> The decision came less than a week after President George Bush and the nation 's Governors huddled in Charlottesville , Va. , for an education summit that endorsed several of the same ideas  --  radical restructuring of schools and creation of national performance goals . " The Texas ruling is consistent with the growing national expectations we are placing on schools , " says Robert Berne , an associate dean at New York University . <P> The push for uniform goals is relatively recent , however , while the movement for uniform financing is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Supreme Court ruled that equal access to education is not a fundamental right under the federal Constitution , at least ten states have seen their school- financing systems overturned under state-constitution provisions . In June the Kentucky Supreme Court struck down that state 's financing methods , ordering the legislature not only to equalize spending but also to reorganize " the whole gamut of the common-school system . " <P> Such moves indicate that the once sacred principle of local control is rapidly going the way of McGuffey 's Reader . " This nation was intensely committed to the idea that each district should be run by school boards unrelated to larger national purposes , " says Ernest Boyer , president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . " Now we are moving toward the issue of how national interests can be served . "
