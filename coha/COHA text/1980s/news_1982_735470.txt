txt Do you know about " The Great Ooze of the 1940s and 1950s when suddenly hard things became soft , large ones small , and marble and granite were overlaid by the spongy and oleaginous " ? " The Great Ooze was the age of what was called admiringly ' cross-fertilization , ' ' synthesis , ' and ' integration . ' Emphasis was on ' breadths , ' and if anyone then had said , as Whitehead once did , that an education has got to be narrow if it is to penetrate , the remark would have been dismissed instantly as one from a philistine . " You can pursue the horrid truths about the Ooze in a caustically funny piece headed " Humanities , " calculated to make any of us men or women associated in any way with that word wince if we are honest . It is an item in a marvelously provocative , opinionated , coruscating book : " Prejudices : A Philosophical Dictionary , " by Robert Nisbet ( Harvard , 318 pages , $17.50 ) . In this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets home free . He is always incisive but not always funny . On " Human Rights " : " The language of rights , which goes back to the Middle Ages , is suffering a debauchery at the present time . . . . Until the formation of the Soviet Union . . . there was but one sense of the word rights in the civilized world , and that was cast overwhelmingly against the State or Government . " Rights are not a gift from the State but are inherent liberties upon which the State must not tread . A threat lurks in a current confusion of " rights " with " entitlements , as to housing , jobs , and vacations . Rights in this sense are perfectly compatible with the most despotic of totalitarianisms . Even an Albania bestows such rights upon its thoroughly enslaved subjects . . . . The time could come when the social entitlements will be widely perceived as more important than the constitutional rights . " which " will mean that the essential institu tional prerequisites of liberal democracy have eroded away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays in " Prejudices " is like sitting down with a man of fine mind and hearing him talk informally , in casual leaps from topic to topic , out of the cumulative hard thought of a lifetime . Agree or not on any given subject , it stimulates immensely . Like Dr. Johnson 's , his talk is boldly assertive . In the root sense , these views are not prejudices  --  not arbitrary or preconceived opinions  --  but the fruit of long observation and experience . The title is an eye-catcher , a code word for strongly held positions , in this case basically conservative but not predictable . For instance , I regret that the alphabetical arrangement leads off with " Abortion , " an issue so charged emotionally that it might stop some readers there . He says rightly that " passion and zeal and sheer hatred have reached an elevation , a plateau , on which only continuing , worsening war is possible . " He would agree with Barry Goldwater that abortion is not a conservative issue in the political sense but in the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of despotism in history is the state 's supersession of the family 's authority over its own . Often such supersession is justified in the name of conscience or individual welfare . " Inevitably the 70 pieces vary in quality . The subject of one sometimes turns- up again , subordinate to another heading , and might seem contradictory if only because approached from a different angle of vision . At best this is Whitmanesque largeness , the containing of multitudes . As in conversation , which It often resembles , not every one stands up under review . Though Prof. Nisbet had the opportunity to edit or expunge it is well that he did not do so excessively , for it is forcefulness without sterilizingly cautious hedging that gives the book its tartness . A biting piece on " Effrontery " ( known also as " chutzpah , " or by the English " cheek " ) gives , as do several other essays , examples involving public persons highly recognizable though unnamed . An interesting discussion of " Tyranny " speaks of " a failure of nerve on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wel come . " But a devil 's advocate may ask , what about the latent tyranny of what Ibsen called " the compact liberal majority " ? He wastes the heading " Snobbism " in a perverse assault upon embattled defenders of conventional standards in grammar . He distinguishes astutely " True Public Opinion " from the mere popular opinion often seen inanely in man-in-the-street interviews beloved of local TV news . He scatters lively images : " . . . the modern age of selfspelunking ego diving , and awareness intoxication . " " Permissiveness " is an " inelegant variation of a simple failure of will . . . not the cause , but the result of the breakdown of authority . . . . And one after another , the constituted authorities erode away under the acids of egalitarianism , the time is reached when there is nothing any longer to be permissive about . " In " Nostalgia " he says : " Man is a time-binding creature , and commitment to the past is but the other side of devotion to the present . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . by no constitutional or moral standards is the Court authorized to enter such delicate , fragile , deeply personal areas as abortion and the artificial sustainment of a dying life . " He is austere about the rights and duties of " Family " : " The family in the large and historic sense of the word has no more to do with love and romance than do State and Church . The fundamental cement of family is duty or obligation , not love . " He is good on " Conservatism , " " Liberalism , " " Dogma , " " Originality , " " Metaphor " and much else . He expounds clearly the widely misunderstood distinction between " Authoritarianism " and " Totalitarianism . " Present-day liberals tend to voice far more outrage about the former than the latter . Prof. Nisbet observes : " Whereas in authoritarian society everything is permitted that is not explicitly forbidden , nothing is permitted in totalitarian society that is not explicitly authorized .
