On the eve of his inauguration as Brazil 's President on March 15 , Tancredo Neves underwent emergency surgery for diverticulitis , an inflammation of the intestinal tract . The operation was judged a success , but five days later Neves was back in surgery . The second operation , last week , was to remove adhesions that prevented the bowel from functioning and caused a buildup of gas and swelling . Doctors predicted afterward that Neves , 75 , would recover fully but slowly . One physician reportedly told the President-elect , " You need to get better . " Replied Neves : " I do n't need to . I must . " <P> His countrymen would agree . Without the Great Conciliator , as he is known , a smooth transition to democracy after more than 21 years of military rule may be threatened . Although Vice President Jose Sarney , 54 , has directed the transfer so far , his background as an ex-member of the military-backed former ruling party makes him unpalatable as President to many factions in a delicately balanced government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end : " I am confident that Tancredo Neves will be sworn in as President in ten to 15 days . "
