With that meeting only a month away , the Americans charge that the Soviet Union backed away from some of its verification obligations under the accord during recent technical talks over how to put it into effect. // Administration officials have been hoping that they could quietly resolve the differences in behind-the-scenes talks , and thus not give ammunition to opponents of the treaty in the Senate . The Senate must approve the accord , and supporters fear that the opponents might be able to use these differences of interpretation as a way to argue that the agreement is unclear or as evidence that the Russians may not honor its terms. // // Follow-Up Discussions Sought // Officials said a cable had been drafted , instructing the United States Embassy to raise the issue with the Soviet Foreign Ministry and to ask Soviet authorities to reconfirm the American understanding of the treaty ' s provisions. // One of the important differences concerns the scope of American monitors ' inspections at Soviet sites . Specifically , the issue is whether the Americans will be allowed to look inside Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not large enough to hide entire SS-20 medium-range missiles. // The Americans insist that the United States won this right during the hectic final hours of treaty talks , two days before it was signed in Washington on Dec. 8 , and that such inspection is incorporated in the agreement . But Maj. Gen. Vladimir Medvedev , a Soviet negotiator of the agreement , disagreed with this view during during technical talks on the treaty in Washington earlier this month. // As the final negotiations on the treaty were being completed , some critics argued that the Administration was preparing a flawed agreement by rushing to finish it in time for signing at the summit meeting , which is to begin May 29 in Moscow . The Administration strongly denied this. // American officials say the two sides also have differences over inspection rights outside the Soviet missile-assembly installation at Votkinsk , and over how much access American inspectors should have to other Soviet facilities. // Some Administration officials said they believe that the differences will ultimately be resolved to the satisfication of the United States. // " When this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an impediment to ratification , they will not let it get in the way , " a ranking official said. // This official said the latest Soviet move may reflect the efforts of " zealots trying to walk back decisions already made and probably does not represent the view of policy-level officials in Moscow who want to move the process forward . " <> <> Russian Refused to Meet // Reagan Administration officials said the United States initially sought to resolve the dispute by asking General Medvedev to meet with Maynard W. Glitman , the principal American negotiator of the accord , a meeting the American side said was necessary because the disputes were too important to be treated as merely a technical matter. // But General Medvedev declined to meet with Mr. Glitman . Administration officials then considered having the issue raised by Secretary of State George P. Shultz during his recent trip to Moscow . Specialists said it was eventually decided that the United States Embassy in Moscow should take up the matter. // One key issue in dispute is the so-called " stages problem , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the treaty was signed. // During the talks , the Russians initially insisted that they should be able to look inside American structures that could hide individual rocket stages , since the American Pershing 2 missile is transported in such stages and assembled on its launcher . But the Russians argued then that the American side should not have the same right because the Soviet SS-20 missile was transported as a complete missile in canisters . <> <> U.S. Thought It Prevailed // The American negotiators rejected this argument and demanded reciprocity . American officials said the Russians finally agreed and added that theit view is supported by the terms of the treaty ' s inspection protocol. // But General Medvedev , in the technical talks , reportedly presented a different view . He suggested that American inspectors should only be able to look inside structures and vehicles that are large enough to hide entire missiles of the type that are kept at a given missile base . For example , American inspectors would only be able to look inside a structure that is large enough to hide SS-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view. // Another difference pertains to the degree of access that American inspectors should have at Soviet sites . The Americans say that inspectors should be allowed to freely carry out inspections within general boundary lines drawn on Soviet diagrams . But in technical talks , Soviet officials suggest that the United States should only be able to inspect buildings drawn in dark lines within these boundaries . <> <> HOUSE REBUFF ON ' STAR WARS ' // WASHINGTON , April 27 ( AP ) - The House voted 252-159 today to ban any " Star Wars " tests that would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , despite opposition by President Reagan. // The vote came as the House began working on a Defense Department budget authorization bill for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. // In effect , the vote requires Mr. Reagan to adhere to the so-called narrow interpretation of the 1972 pact , even though the Administration holds that it has the legal right to adopt a broad view , one allowing expanded testing of " Star Wars , " the space-based anti-missile system. //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
