With deductions for credit cards and other consumer loans being phased out , attention is being drawn to alternative financing sources , such as home loans , where interest deductions will be preserved. // " I think there ' s going to be a massive restructuring of credit by consumers in this country , " said Charles A. Humm , vice president of the credit management group at Merrill Lynch , which has been promoting home-equity loans . " The idea is to reduce or possibly eliminate the use of consumer debt and use other forms of credit that are still deductible . " <> <> A New Form of Financing // In recent weeks financial institutions have been hawking second mortgages and home-equity loans as the vogue in consumer financing . Even colleges that make direct loans to students are advised by tax consultants to get into the mortgage business so the loans will remain deductible. // Meanwhile , brokerage house margin accounts are gaining new appeal as one of the last bastions of interest deductions . Interest on borrowings to finance investments ( including margin accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income earned during the year. // As a general rule , consumer debt will become more expensive under the new tax law . Deductions for credit card finance charges , car loans , student loans , Internal Revenue Service interest charges and other consumer loans will be phased out over a four-year period . In 1987 only 65 percent of such interest will be deductible , 40 percent in 1988 , then 20 percent in 1989 and 10 percent in 1990 . <> <> Doubling the Actual Cost // This means the real cost of consumer loans eventually will as much as double . Until now , for a top bracket taxpayer , credit card finance charges of 18 percent have effectively been reduced to 9 percent by the interest deduction . But under the new law the out-of-pocket cost of an 18 percent credit charge will be the full 18 percent after such deductions are completely phased out. // Most American households - particularly non-itemizers who were never able to claim interest deductions anyway - are not likely to care . They might even benefit from the repeal of the deduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the new tax law. // But for the estimated 28 percent of households that have used interest deductions , the story is different . Some may simply end up borrowing less than they did before . But others may turn to alternative financing sources where rates are lower or deductions continue . <> <> Using Mortgage Interest // Since mortgage interest will remain deductible , homeowners can borrow against their homes to finance consumer purchases and still deduct the interest . Bankers and brokers have been promoting second mortgages and home-equity loans as salvation for homeowners seeking a deductible way to finance college educations , cars and other items. // " It ' s like a bakery line at most of the financial instituions out here , " said Richard A. Sprayregen , a financial services partner at the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &; Company in Los Angeles . " With the prospect of losing the interest deduction on their Mercedes or Jaguar , they ' re trying to rechannel their borrowing to their home. " // Second mortgages and home-equity loans have become popular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them an extra push. // Home-equity loans are technically second mortgages , but there are substantial differences . <> <> How a Home Loan Works // With a second mortgage , the borrower gets a lump-sum check for the full amount of the loan upon signing the papers . But a home-equity loan is essentially a revolving line of credit , where money is drawn as needed by writing a check or , in some cases , by using a credit card . Terms for second mortgages range from 5 to 15 years ; home-equity loans can run longer. // Tax and investment advisers say home loans can be an economical way of borrowing for various needs , but they urge caution. // First , they recommend shopping around because terms vary widely from institution to institution . Today home loan rates range from 7. 5 percent to 10. 5 percent , according to HSH Associates , a mortgage monitoring firm in Riverdale , N.J. Most lenders also charge " points " - up-front fees of 2 to 3 percent of the loan amount . The loans also commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HSH . In a few areas , such as Georgia , rate wars have developed and some lenders now waive closing costs . <> <> Warning on Rate Changes // Another reason to be cautious is that many lenders offer no protection against a spurt in interest rates . In contrast to first mortgages , variable-rate second mortgages and home-equity loans often have no limit on how far the rate can rise , said Paul Havemann , vice president of HSH. // If interest rates shoot up , therefore , monthly payments could rise to unaffordable levels . Falling behind on home-loan payments can jeopardize more than a person ' s credit rating : A house can be lost just as easily as with a first mortgage. // Mr. Havemann recommends that the borrower ask the lender for a document disclosing the terms in detail , including what index is used to adjust the loan rate. // In addition , he suggests that homeowners calculate whether refinancing a first mortgage , which usually carries lower rates , would be less costly than taking out a second mortgage or a home-equity loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , " he said . <> <> How Much Banks Will Lend // As a rule of thumb , banks will lend up to 75 or 80 percent of a home ' s fair market value . Under the new law , however , mortgage interest deductions on first and second homes are limited to the original purchase price of the home plus the cost of improvements . Deductions for loans in excess of that amount are disallowed unless the extra borrowings are for educational or medical expenses. // Thus , if a house originally cost $70 , 000 and a $30 , 000 swimming pool were added to the house , mortgage interest on as much as $100 , 000 in home loans would be deductible - no matter what the purpose . If the homeowner had a total of $125 , 000 in home loans outstanding , the extra $25 , 000 would be deductible only if it were for medical or educational expenses. // To protect Americans who borrowed heavily against the appreciated value of their homes in recent years , Congress exempted mortgage debt incurred before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed on or after Aug. 17 are bound by the new limits . This will make it difficult for many people to tap the equity in their homes . <> <> New Reason to Sell Home // For example , someone who purchased a house 20 years ago for $30 , 000 , which is now worth $200 , 000 , would be stuck with the $30 , 000 limit on deductible mortgage loans - unless improvements had been made to the house or the borrowings were for medical or educational expenses. // Lawrence B. Gibbs , the new Internal Revenue Commissioner , speculated recently that these restrictions might encourage some homeowners to sell their houses and buy new ones to get around the new limits . For instance , a homeowner facing the $30 , 000 limit could sell the home for $200 , 000 and buy a new one for $200 , 000 . By making the swap , the taxpayer could claim deductions on an extra $170 , 000 of mortgage loans. // One issue awaiting clarification from the Internal Revenue Service is what educational borrowings qualify for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the expenses must be " paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after such indebtedness is incurred . " One question is how the I.R.S. will define " reasonable . " <> <> Unresolved Expense Issue // " It ' s clear that you could take out a home-equity loan and write a check for the current year ' s education expenses , " said Kaye B. Ferriter , a tax partner in the Boston office of Coopers &; Lybrand , the accounting firm . " But whether or not you could take out a loan in year one that is large enough to cover four years of school is questionable. " // Albert Ellentuck , a tax partner at the accounting firm of Laventhol &; Horwath , said he would probably advise people to wait , if they can , until I.R.S. regulations resolve the issue. // Although home loans are expected to become a major source of educational financing , they may not always be best for other purposes .
