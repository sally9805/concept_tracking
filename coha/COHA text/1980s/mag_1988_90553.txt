" Man , it was low , " said Army halfback Mike May weather . " You could throw a football and knock out one of its windows . " All week long , F-4s , C-5s , A-10s and the huge B-52 had buzzed the campus . " We told ourselves we 'd remember the planes , " said Mayweather . " And we did . " // Mayweather , a sophomore , was discussing the air raids shortly after he 'd gained 192 yards on 30 carries to lead the surprising Cadets  --  now 7-1  --  to a 28-15 upset of Air Force on Saturday at Michie Stadium . " I know we have Navy down the road , " he said , " but we wanted this game more . " // There 's some serious nastiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly-boys ' sexy scarf-and-leather-jacket image ; the jet jockeys consider the cadets , well , grimy . No one behaves like a gentleman when these future officers meet . // The weather Saturday was suitably raw : Rain fell in torrents . Army coach Jim Young loved it . " Cadets get rained on in foxholes all the time , " he said . " What other people consider obstacles , they don't. " // In the early going the weather looked as if it might help to slow Air Force , the nation 's top rushing offense ( 399.3 yards per game ) . For 18 scoreless minutes the teams were mirror-images : From the wishbone , Air Force ran left-end , right-end , off-tackle ; Army danced the same step . " We 're very similar , and that 's no accident , " says Young . " We 're modeled on them . When I came here in 1983 , I used the same pro-type passing offense I had at Purdue . But it just did n't work . " // After Army finished 2-9 that season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized an option offense is perfect for the service academies , " he says . " Our offensive linemen are n't that big , and in a wishbone with angle blocking , they do n't have to be . We do n't need great passing quarterbacks , and a wishbone fits an academy 's philosophy . It requires discipline , execution of assignments , working as a unit . " // Young has since led a no-nonsense , no-passing attack to a 33-18-1 record and two bowl victories . Today 's Army ranks 104th in the country in passing , but it has lost only to Washington . Since 1984 the Cadets are 23-0 in games in which they 've passed fewer than six times , 3-14-1 when they 've attempted more than nine passes . // Not to be out-wishboned , Air Force ranks 100th in passing . So it was a huge surprise when , on the 42nd play from scrimmage in Saturday 's game . Falcon quarterback Dee Dowis threw the day 's first pass  --  for a 35-yard touchdown , no less  --  to halfback Albert Booker. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored on two consecutive possessions before the half . The first touchdown came on a five-yard run by quarterback Bryan McWilliams ; the second was on a one-yard smash up the middle by fullback Ben Barnett . Air Force trailed 14-7 at the half . // In the third period the defenses dominated , which was doubly surprising : Army stopped the vaunted Falcon attack , and Air Force stopped ... somebody . The Falcon defense , wracked by injuries , has allowed more than 30 points a game this season . The Cadet D has n't been that bad , but it did n't figure to shut down the Falcons ' Dee . Dowis , who hails from Ty Cobb 's hometown of Royston , Ga. , is quick-footed and quick-witted , able to flip the ball to a trailing halfback at the last split second . Last year , as a sophomore , he ran for 1,315 yards , establishing an NCAA season rushing record for quarterbacks . Air Force has four other horsemen for opposing defenses to contend with ; before the season ends , the Falcons will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career rushing yards apiece . // Nevertheless , against Army , Dowis gained only 31 yards in 10 carries , and Air Force rushed for a mere 176 yards . The Cadets also came up with a big turnover . On the first play of the final period , Dowis fumbled at his own 20 , and Army linebacker Greg Gadson pounced on the ball . The Cadets scored three plays later  --  on a run , of course , by McWilliams  --  and went ahead 21-7 . Then Mayweather took over : On Army 's next possession  --  a 16-play , 77-yard drive  --  he carried eight times for three first downs and the touchdown . His 192 yards marked a career high and his fourth straight 100-yard game . // Mayweather , a 5 ' 8 " , 180 pounder from St. Louis , is an atypical West Pointer . " We were impoverished . " he says . " My mother raised 10 children on her own . We were in a rough neighborhood , and I went to an all-black grade school . I liked to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . // " St. Louis Country Day , which is very exclusive , came to my middle school looking for black students who could do well there . I got in . There were two blacks in my class , out of 69 kids . It was hard , but I was a B-plus student , and I was three times all-state in football . " // Mayweather was recruited by Missouri , Stanford , Notre Dame and Michigan , but he realized that his size might be a handicap . " I was worried I might not make it in football , " he said . " I decided on West Point because if the football did n't work out , I 'd still have the education and I 'd be an officer . " // Mayweather , an unlikely star on an unlikely 7-1 team , added , " Maybe when I 'm done with my Army commitment , I 'll take a shot at pro ball . I 've learned recently that dreams can come true . " // TYING ONE ON // After its 19-18 defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SEC 's Sugar Bowl berth within its grasp , a fact that 's not exactly leading the bowl officials down in the French Quarter to whoop it up . Nothing against the Tigers , understand , but the Sugar would be sweeter with either of the two other bowl berth possibilities , Auburn and Georgia , which play this Saturday . // For one thing , most of LSU 's fans live near New Orleans , so they 're unlikely to spend as much time or money in the city 's hotels and nightspots as the Dawg or Auburn Tiger faithful would . But more important , the Tigers , who put together back-to-back losses against Ohio State and Florida earlier in the season , wo n't be ranked high enough to draw an attractive opponent to the Sugar Bowl . // Yet all LSU has to do to win a share of the SEC title is beat 1-7 Mississippi State in Starkville on Saturday . If Georgia defeats Auburn , the Bulldogs would wrap up a tie with LSU ( the two teams do n't meet this season ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat Alabama on Nov. 25 to tie the Bayou Bengals. // In the event of cochampions , the Sugar has , in the past , taken the higher-ranked team . If Auburn and LSU tie , that would be Auburn , especially considering that LSU has a near-certain loss to Miami still ahead on Nov. 19. // But keep in mind that Auburn lost to LSU , 7-6 , Auburn 's only loss to date . If the Sugar Bowl committee were to pick Auburn and say ' bye , you Bengals , the folks in Baton Rouge would be tougher to handle than a hot bowl of gumbo. // At least LSU has a marquee-name quarterback in Tommy Hodson , who , despite a generally disappointing performance , engineered a late scoring drive against Alabama to set up David Browndyke 's decisive 34-yard field goal . Meanwhile Auburn and Georgia got ready for each other with surprisingly easy wins over Southern Mississippi ( 38-8 ) and Florida ( 26-3 ) , respectively . Even the return of tailback Emmitt Smith ( 68 yards rushing ) could n't help the slumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , the All-American Bowl is still interested in Florida . // THE COWBOYS ' LAMENT // Since 1932 , when the presidential candidates were named Roosevelt and Hoover , Oklahoma has lost only twice in Stillwater , the home of intrastate rival Oklahoma State . The Sooners got out of town with another win last Saturday , but only a step ahead of the posse . // Trailing 31-28 , which would be the final score , the Cowboys found themselves with a third-and-two at the Sooner 19 late in the game . Quarterback Mike Gundy 's handoff went to tailback Barry Sanders , the national rushing leader , who had already gained 214 yards and scored two touchdowns , but he got only a yard . Worse , a personal-foul call against Oklahoma State fullback Garrett Limbrick made it fourth-and-16 instead of fourth-and-one with 43 seconds to play . // It was unclear exactly what had happened , and the referees were n't talking after the game . One possibility was that side judge Michael Borgard thought Limbrick had cursed him . Limbrick said he was addressing his unsavory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just been separated by the official . // Whatever . The call meant that State 's only chance was a pass into the end zone . Gundy put it right on the money to wide receiver Brent Parker , who got behind Oklahoma free safety Kevin Thompson . Parker dropped the ball . // The consolation was that bowl scouts wo n't take their eyes off the colorful Cowboys , who are 6-2 and almost certain to be 8-2 when the bids go out Nov. 19. // ARMED AND INJURED // While West Virginia 's Major Harris and Michigan 's Michael Taylor were the most famous quarterbacks to be injured last week  --  Harris suffered a minor hip pointer in a 51-13 win over Cincinnati , and Taylor broke his collarbone in a 22-7 defeat of Minnesota and may be out for the season  --  Northern Arizona was feeling the loss of the much less celebrated but no less talented Greg Wyatt . // Before going down with a knee injury in the second quarter of what turned out to be a 25-12 victory over Northern Iowa , Wyatt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdown . That gave the junior career totals of 701 completions for 8,014 yards . No nonsenior has ever joined the 700 club , and only three other passers have reached the 8,000 plateau before their senior years . // If that does n't grab your attention , try this : Wyatt has thrown at least one touchdown pass in 18 straight games and in 27 of his 30 starts and has completed more than 50% of his passes in every game he has played . Wyatt 's replacement , redshirt freshman walk-on Brad Scott , filled in well enough to get Northern Arizona in range for Micky Penaflor 's field goals of 46 , 23 , 39 , 44 , 45 and 20 yards .
