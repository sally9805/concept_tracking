In the 1978 voting , 63 women were elected as first-time legislators across the United States . Sixty-one of the 63 women belonged to the same political party . Which party was it ? // If you answered Democratic . . . well , you were wrong . The correct reply was the Republican Party - you know , the party with the ' ' gender gap. ' ' // That story illustrates why some Republicans think the whole fuss over the gender gap is a bum rap . After all , they say , just look at the evidence : // Who appointed Sandra Day O ' Connor , the first and only woman US Supreme Court justice ? President Reagan did. // Which party elected eight out of nine women running for the state Senate in Rhode Island this year ? The Republicans. // Who has more women members ( three ) in his Cabinet than any chief executive in history ? President Reagan. // Which party ran several thousand women candidates for state and local offices in 1982 , the most women ever offered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently appointed a woman ( Elizabeth Hanford Dole ) to head the Department of Transportation , and thereby designated her as the first woman ever to head a US military organization ( the Coast Guard ) ? President Reagan. // All of this seems to make little difference with many women . Despite his recent gains in the polls , President Reagan continues to run about 10 points weaker with women than with men. // The ' ' gender gap , ' ' however , is more than just numbers , more than just something dreamed up by pollsters Gallup and Roper . It highlights basic public attitudes toward Reagan and the Republicans which could play a critical role in the 1984 election - and in the future of both the Republican and Democratic Parties. // Behind the gender gap are at least two basic concepts now widely shared. // First is the public view of the ' ' fairness ' ' issue - namely , that Reagan and his party have been unfair to the poor ( especially to single female heads of households ) and unfair to the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan &; Co. are charged with the ' ' feminization of poverty , ' ' with changing federal programs in ways that have hurt women and children the most. // Second is the perception of ' ' warmongering ' ' - namely , that Reagan is a saber-rattler who has militarized foreign policy , and who would rather fight than negotiate . Many women ' ' deeply fear war , ' ' says Mary Dent Crisp , a former GOP co-chairman . She charges that President Reagan is alienating women with his policies. // Does all of this put a dark cloud over the Republicans in 1984 and beyond ? // It could - if that were all that was happening . But Reagan and the Republicans , in the view of a wide range of political experts here , have shrewdly positioned themselves for 1984 . Many women have turned away from Reagan . But other women , especially conservative homemakers , have not . And while some groups , such as blacks , have been alienated , others , such as white Southerners , have moved closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news media may be putting too much emphasis on the gender gap and thereby missing the big point . In presidential politics , he says , it is the Republicans , not the Democrats , who have become the dominant force. // Look at the record . Despite the Democrats ' 2-to-1 advantage in registration , Republicans have clobbered them in presidential elections in 1952 , 1956 , 1972 , and 1980 - plus a narrow GOP victory in 1968 . The Democrats won only one landslide - in 1964 - and managed hairs-breadth victories in 1948 , 1960 , and 1976. // The inside political wisdom in Washington is that Reagan , if he runs , will win again in 1984 . Certainly , if recent polls are any indication , the ' 84 race will be a hard one for the Democrats. // Further , the GOP now dominates the Senate . And in the House , while nostalgia and tradition help to maintain a Democratic majority ( largely due to white Southern conservatives voting Democratic ) , the Republicans have frequently enjoyed an ideological majority , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really as bad off as many people suggest ? Or are concerns about the ' ' gender gap , ' ' the ' ' black gap , ' ' the ' ' Hispanic gap , ' ' and other gaps overblown ? // Analysts say it ' s a mixed picture . There are genuine concerns . One critic , Republican Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon , says : ' ' You can not write ( the women ' s vote ) off and the blacks off and the Hispanics off and the Jews off and assume you are going to build a party on white Anglo-Saxon males over 40 . There aren ' t enough of us left . ' ' But other Republicans say they have moved to expand that ' ' Anglo-Saxon base by building support elsewhere . And the President symbolizes that effort. // ' ' Despite what you hear , the John Wayne image hasn ' t hurt Reagan or the Republicans , ' ' one analyst suggests . In fact , the image of toughness with the Russians , chopping wood on the ranch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps Reagan and the party with groups they need in 1984. // Those groups are the same ones that helped Reagan whip Jimmy Carter in 1980 . The most important are : // Men . While Republicans have lost support among women , they have showed impressive strength with the male vote . Men seem to like Reagan ' s firmness on foreign policy and defense and his efforts to cut waste at home. // Housewives . ' ' When a woman calls herself a ' housewife ' or a ' homemaker ' that ' s almost a political statement , and it probably means she ' ll vote Republican , ' ' observes a political strategist . While Republicans have lost ground with career women , housewives support Reagan and the Republicans even more enthusiastically than men. // Labor unions . Despite the Democratic leanings of the leadership , millions of union members swung over to Reagan in 1980 , and many are expected to stay with him as the economy gets stronger. // Roman Catholics . The White House has courted Catholics with promises of tuition tax credits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first in American history ) , opposition to abortion , and support for school prayer. // Jews . Reagan ' s tough policy in Lebanon plus his new aid package for Israel plays well with Jewish voters . Supporters of Israel are also concerned about the Mideast policies of some Democratic candidates for president. // Hispanics . Cuban-Americans are firmly Republican , but other Hispanics lean Democratic . Overall Reagan received about 30 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1980 , and the latest Gallup poll shows him doing even better , with about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. // Southerners . Despite major black registration efforts in Dixie , it should be another good year for Reagan . ' ' You hear lots about black registration in the South . What you don ' t hear about is the white family of six in the old jalopy voting for the first time . That ' s been a major new development there , ' ' one analyst says. // If the Republicans can pull these groups together , Reagan should sweep back into office - though with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insiders say. // Republicans , of course , would like to have the votes of blacks , career women , and others who lean Democratic . But even getting the black vote up from 10 percent to 20 percent would be a major effort . There ' s not enough time or money before ' 84 to do it - and the focus of the campaign has to go where the payoff is big and quick. // ' ' There ' s an old Tennessee saying , ' ' says former GOP chairman Bill Brock . ' ' When you hunt ducks , you go where the ducks are. ' ' // // Next : Why the 1988 election is ' ' the big one. ' ' // //
