Mr. Govostes , a burly , jovial man whose regular calling is master plumber , shyly offered his hundred or so onlookers a cooking pointer or two . But his gravelly voice was lost in the din of Boston ' s Quincy Marketplace. // What brings a working man from Winchester , Mass. , down to Boston to demonstrate his cooking skills ? // // The same thing that brought Irene Lewis up from Brackney , Pa . , Kathy Hodapp from Belle Plaine , Minn. , and Donald Newman from Little River , Calif. // All were first-place winners in Yankee Magazine ' s ' ' Great New England Cook Off . ' ' In total , 17 prizewinning cooks traveled to the Hub last week , courtesy of Yankee , to prepare their specialties before the mobs of tourists at the city ' s premiere food emporium. // Some were a little incredulous that their kitchen experiments had brought such recognition . ' ' I came up with it for my wife - as a small , Saturday night supper , ' ' said Ed Govostes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. Newman , a lanky Californian from that state ' s rugged northern coast , was ' ' very surprised ' ' that his Smoked Salmon Chowder took a blue ribbon . He had thought it would be too non-traditional . But aside from the salmon , the ingredients are similar to those in good old-fashioned New England clam chowder . ' ' It shouldn ' t offend too many Yankees , ' ' he guessed. // Mrs. Hodapp devised her Fresh Rhubarb Cheesecake to solve ( half solve , anyway ) a perennial problem in her region : ' ' In Minnesota , we always have an excess of zucchini and rhubarb . ' ' She never would have dreamed of entering the dish in a contest , but her parents , Yankee subscribers , urged her on. // Other winners brought the confidence born of experience to the competition . Deedy Marble , an innkeeper from Ludlow , Vt. , says ' ' thousands of guests ' ' have raved about her Gram ' s Graham Bread. // And Martha Davis of Inman , S.C. , proclaiming herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made only a slight change in her Yankee Cheesecake Soup for the contest . ' ' I use it in my home all the time , ' ' she said . Then , with a wink she confided , ' ' For the contest I put ' Yankee ' in front of it. ' ' // The response to the cookoff , originally announced in the March issue of Yankee , was overwhelming , says Susan Peery , the magazine ' s food editor . Readers sent in 1 , 500 recipes . A panel of home economists narrowed the entrants down to 51 dishes - three in each of 17 categories . In August , a team of Boston-area food experts picked the first-place winners. // The dishes are a creative cross section of American home cooking . Some are simplicity itself ; some border on the complex . When it comes to cooking , clearly , Yankee ingenuity knows no region. // Here ' s a selection of the winners : %% <> Yankee Cheesecake Soup <> 1/2 cup butter <> 3/4 cup chopped onion <> 1/2 cup finely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken broth <> 1 1/2 cups water <> 1/2 teaspoon salt <> 1 8-ounce package cream cheese , slightly warmed in double boiler <> 1 cup yogurt , slightly warmed <> 2 egg yolks , beaten <> White pepper <> Freshly chopped parsley // Melt butter in large pot over medium heat .
