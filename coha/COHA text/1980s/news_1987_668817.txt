What : Japan Days Festival Where : Chicago Botanic Garden , Lake-Cook Road , half-mile east of Edens Expressway , Glencoe ; 835-5440 . When : Noon-6 p. m . Saturday and Table Sunday How much : Free ; $1 parking for non-members . <> April was always Ikka Nakashima ' s favorite month . When she was growing up in Japan , it was the time of the cherry blossom festival . Not a raucous , boisterous event , but a few precious days to enjoy what the Japanese call the " viewing of flowers . " She remembers it as the festival she loved most . " The whole family would go and take lunch and sit down under the trees and appreciate nature , " says Nakashima . She also remembers that , for her as a child , those days came and went far too fast because the winds would come and blow the blossoms away . " I always gave my mother a hard time , asking why they had to go away , " she says . " I wanted them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always the same . She ' d say that no matter how beautiful things are , they never , never last and that we are like cherry blossoms , that life is very short and then it ' s gone . " I realize now that she was right because nature explained it to me , " says Nakashima , who eventually came to the United States to study and stayed on to work as a microbiologist . It ' s in May though , not in April , that the 80 cherry blossom trees at the Botanic Garden in Glencoe tend to bloom . Only the weather can decide whether they ' ll be in bloom for visitors to view during the Japanese festival to be held there on Saturday and Sunday , or whether the wind will have already scattered their beautiful , ephemeral pale petals . But the Japanese arts performed during the weekend festival and the crafts that will be demonstrated will reveal to the observant visitor the spiritual and esthetic threads that weave nature and art and life into one for the Japanese people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present as but a fleeting moment are expressed in ikebana , the Japanese art of flower arranging that Nakashima teaches in Chicago and will be demonstrating this weekend at the Botanic Garden . " We appreciate nature for its beauty , then we cut branches and flowers and make them beautiful and then in two or three days they are gone , " says Nakashima . But the beauty of ikebana may appear as nothing more than sparse to the unaccustomed American eye . " Western arrangements tend to have many flowers with different colors , but in Japan we use only one kind of flower , and the line and the contrast of mass and space are important , " explains Akiko Shirayama , vice consul with the consulate general of Japan in Chicago . Classical Japanese dance reflects the same appreciation of beauty found in simplicity that is expressed in the exquisite flower arrangements . There are no breathtaking , back-breaking leaps and jumps to learn , but it nevertheless takes years of training to master the skills and subtleties of the art . Mitsu Uchimoto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dance movements that emphasize the beauty of line , the art of applying the white makeup and designing a cherry-red mouth , and the style of dressing in many layers of colorful kimonos at the Wakayagi school in Japan , which specializes in training female dancers . Uchimoto , who was accorded the honor of adding the school name to her own school ' s name , has been training young women at Wakayagi Shiyu Kai in Chicago for 25 years . Uchimoto says that in classic dance , as was the way in everyday life for Japanese women , the knees must always be together so that when a woman moves the kimono never gapes open . To achieve this technique , Uchimoto says she practiced dancing with a sheet of paper held between her thighs . In classic dance the knees are always bent but the back remains straight , a posture she perfected by dancing with a pole tucked down the back of her kimono . The shoulders are always held down , leaving the arms relaxed to perform exquisite feats with the fan , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds it in front of her face to show she ' s crying or has one in either hand with arms extended to express joy . Sometimes the fan imitates the movements of birds ' wings fluttering or leaves falling . Fans also are used in Minyo Japanese folk dancing . " In classical dance the fan has more meaning ; in folk dancing the fan is used like a prop , perhaps held at the side like a box used for rice planting , " explains Doris Endo , who dances with the Midwest Minyo Group , which will perform at the festival . A professor from Japan has been coming each year to teach them the traditional dances , many of which are meant to invoke conditions favorable to producing abundance for farmers and fishermen and to express joy for good crops and good catches . " If we hike our dresses up just a little bit , it means it ' s a dance from an area of dry land , " says Endo . " If we hike them higher and don ' t wear slippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk dance , the dancers wear very large straw hats . " In olden times , " Endo says , " the peasants wore them because they were not allowed to look up at the emperor . If you did , you would get your head cut off . " Understanding the precise subtleties of dress and hair style , which denoted one ' s social standing , is essential in kaminigyo , the art of making paper dolls that Endo also will demonstrate this weekend . Authenticity of character , be it a princess or a peasant , a dancer or a samurai , is essential . " You have to know whether the character ' s topknot is supposed to be high or low , whether the knob of hair that sticks out ( akin to a ponytail ) is long or short , " explains Endo . The dolls she makes are not flat cutouts but three-dimensionsal figures created out of special paper she purchases at Aiko ' s , a store on North Wabash Avenue that sells nearly 500 kinds of paper , most handmade in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper may cost anywhere from $2. 50 to $30 a sheet , but in contrast to paper made from pulp in America , which eventually disintegrates into dust , the handmade Japanese paper lasts almost forever , according to Aiko Nakane , the store ' s owner . ) The technique Endo uses to make the dolls , she says , is an offshoot of origami paper folding . The figures always remain faceless because , Endo says , " You ' re supposed to use your imagination . The way the doll is posed , the way the head is cocked gives it an expression . It ' s subtle like a flower arrangement , and line and space and movement are important . " Endo came late to her knowledge of Japanese culture . She was born in the United States , where her family ' s history mirrored that of many other Japanese immigrants . " My father came to California at the turn of the century because land was scarce in Japan , " she says . " The Japanese came here to find a better life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was in her late teens , the international conflict eclipsed " the good life . " Although her brothers were drafted into the American army , Endo and her parents and her sisters were moved to Arkansas from California to one of several relocation camps where people of Japanese ancestry were incarcerated . " They told us it was for our own protection in case the Japanese invaded the United States , " says Ted Uchimoto , president of the Japanese American Association of Chicago , which now promotes Japanese culture but was created to help people resettle in Chicago after the war . When the Japanese were finally allowed to leave the camps , many were not given the freedom to return to California . Uchimoto says one Chicago publisher came to the camp and offered jobs , and Uchimoto and many others were hired . The community of people of Japanese ancestry , which numbered several hundred in Chicago before the war , thus grew to include 25 , 000 people . In time , many of them would return to California . But today there still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago area and from 5 , 000 to 7 , 000 Japanese nationals ( most of whom work for Japanese companies ) in Elk Grove Village , Elmhurst and Schaumburg . It was only after the war that Endo finally set about exploring the Japanese heritage that was hers . " When my children were growing up , I got more interested because I thought they should know their own culture , " she says . Endo had much to learn along with them . " During the war , " she recalls , " nobody liked the Japanese , we were hated and called names ; so later you needed to find your own identity . " Endo discovered what many students of Japanese culture quickly realize : " The more you learn , the more complicated it gets . " EXPLORING A CULTURE Many Japanese Americans in Chicago are trying to preserve their heritage by offering classes in language and dance , in judo and karate , in calligraphy and ink painting . They are passing on their knowledge of Japan ' s arts and crafts not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots in Japan but for various reasons , have a growing interest in the country and its culture . At Northwestern University , where 20 students were learning Japanese five years ago , now there are 100 . " Before , students taking Japanese were majoring in the humanities , " explains Hiroki Kato , associate professor in the department of Asian and African languages , " but today the majority of students are very practical-minded young people going into business , law and some even medicine . " Other students may be exploring Japanese culture in search of more spiritual aspects that are the legacy of Buddhism . " The world is so high-tech and mechanized today , and people have lost their souls somewhere and maybe they ' re looking for them , " says Kay Kawaguchi , editor of the Japanese section of the Japanese American newspaper the Chicago Shimpo . The spiritual aspects of Buddhism , which permeate Japanese culture , are revealed in the tea ceremony . Much more than just sipping a cup of green tea , the ceremony is like a slow-motion ballet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony , respect , purity and tranquility . " The tea ceremony is an encapsulation or purified version of the underlying cultural values of Japan , " says Kato . Akiko Shirayama , vice consul with the consulate general of Japan in Chicago , adds , " If you are interested in Japan , the tea ceremony is a great entrance into its culture .
