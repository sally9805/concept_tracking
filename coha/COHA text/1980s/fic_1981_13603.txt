The winter solstice is being celebrated by an annual fertility ritual intended to call back the sun and to start the gradual lengthening of days leading to spring and the return of growth to the land . Three times the people dance in a winding procession around the four corners of the land they farm for their lord OWAIN . PEOPLE singing : Each spirit of life bless our calling . Each daimon who lives in each ridge , Each spirit of plain and of field , Bless the need that we have for the sun to return . Bless the need that we have for the sun to return . Bless each maiden and youth . Each woman and tender youngling . With the fire that passes between them . Let them call back the light of the sun . Let them call back the light of the sun . Bless each goat , sheep and lamb , Each cow , and horse and pig . Infuse all the flocks and the herds With desire to mount , thrust and receive . With desire to mount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walks thrice around . Let cold winter 's chaste cover be softened Beneath the weight of Lord Owain . May the earth shift and groan with desire . May the earth shift and groan with desire . OWAIN is at the head of the procession . Dancing with him is a young woman named ELEN , his mistress of the moment , who is the daughter of ANGUS , the carver , the senior and perhaps most authoritative man in the land  --  he is the director of this ritual and the maker of the ritual masks . As the procession leaves the yard , ANGUS appears , carrying the rough wooden mask of a puck goat 's head . It is comical and grotesque . With him is IAN , the shepherd. p. 3 IAN Off they go , thrice round the fields . The proud King Owain with his bright maid , your daughter , my friend , I believe ? It 's a sight for starved eyes , a comforting sight , for the frost is heavy and the light is short and there 's no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first spring day . ANGUS Aye , who 's to say if Owain himself will live to welcome the wheat . IAN Do n't speak that way , man ; you forget that the health of the king and the wealth of the land are , after all , one and the same . ANGUS Are they now , shepherd lad ? Do you think so ? IAN That 's what we 're here for , is n't it  --  to plead with the spirits of life for return of warmth and of growth and renewal of strength for the king ? ANGUS Aye , that 's what we 're here for , so some say . But it is n't the spirits of earth who grant power to the king nor he who grants power to them . IAN What do you mean ? ANGUS It 's the man who gives actual shape to dreams , desires and fears who has power over all and might make a new king , if he choose . Put on this mask I have carved . IAN Let me look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear that . p. 4 ANGUS Why not , if I might ask ? IAN Oh , it 's a good piece of work . It 's carefully made , well wrought . But there 's something not right . ANGUS What do you mean , man , speak up . I carved this mask . IAN Oh , there 's nothing wrong . No , not at all . ANGUS Well , then , put it on . We have n't all day . They 'll be thrice round the fields in no time at all . IAN It 's just . . . Well , it 's not noble or fine . It 's a bit ugly , if I might say . ANGUS It 's been crafted with your shape in mind . IAN Take it away . I 'll act my part without a mask . I 'm a shepherd , do n't forget . I know how the puck goats run wild in the hills . ANGUS All right . That 's where we 'll start . We 'll work from the inside out . Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prance and kick his heels in the manner of a wild four-legged thing . That 's grand . Kick with a bit more force . Out to the side a bit more . IAN falls while trying to execute the instructions . Get up , try it again . Now bellow a bit , if you can . IAN lets out a wild bray . Louder , wilder , if you know what I mean . You 've been stuck alone up in the hills . There 's frost on the ground . The days are dark and the nights are long . You come down close to the barn . You smell a soft manny inside . Bellow , man , bellow with love and desire . IAN bellows again . Louder , kick higher . The race of goats will perish from earth if the puck goat is timid and weak . IAN stops suddenly . Put this on . ANGUS fits the mask on IAN 's head . You 're not who you were . You 're the fertile puck from the mountain tops come to plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's breaking my neck . Take it off . How can I mount my bride bearing the weight of this head ? ANGUS Stop moaning , now , be still . You do n't have to mount her at all . You just bellow and kick , then you 're killed . You fall to the ground . Be careful to land on your shoulder first . Do n't hurt the mask . We 'll use it again next year . IAN What do you mean ? The whole race of goats demands my seed . He bellows and kicks , dips his head , charges at ANGUS . The nannies line up to receive . I have to mount each one in turn or there 'll be no milk , no butter , no cheese , no meat , no flesh without me ! More bellows and kicks , again dips his head , charges at ANGUS . ANGUS putting his hands on IAN 's shoulders , holding him at bay : That 's good , puck goat , good . We need the one who dares reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast that no one tames . We need to slaughter you and drink your blood . IAN stamps his feet and bellows . BRIGIT , the midwife , enters . Brigit , look at the god of desire who dies for us all . BRIGIT Aye , he is fearsome and grand . IAN lets out a terrible cry of pain , like an animal before the slaughter . Do n't be afraid , puck . I 've arnica root to soothe each bruise . Ignatia to help you return to yourself . p. 6 ANGUS After you 've died , she 'll give you a potion to make you rise . The puck goat will revive in a magical way . BRIGIT Be brave , puck goat , brave . ANGUS You 're a thing I 've carved from many a shared dream . You live ; the mortal king you battle with will die . OWAIN 's wife , ETAIN , enters . She is very pregnant . She comes with VINCENT , the monk . Use your fancy , man . Use your mind . Bellow and kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord Owain , herself . You are for each what they long to become , the force that brings life from death . IAN bellows and kicks . Go , puck , go . Run after the king . Kick dirt in his face . IAN goes out , following the sound of the procession . ANGUS and BRIGIT follow . VINCENT This is a custom I am long revolted by . The calling up of their false gods , the way they idolize their thirst for blood and sex . ETAIN It 's not their rite I tremble at , it is the fact their king has used me as he 'll use that puck , a thing to conquer and disarm ; or as he used the fields beneath his feet , a thing to trample on , a thing to plant ; or as he 'll use that girl who clings now to his arm , a thing to wonder at and to destroy . p. 7 VINCENT The pagan carver with his pagan masks has evoked this bloody lust ; you can win Lord Owain back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from a boy . Now his daughter throws herself at him . The pagan carver looks with jealous eyes . He sees his own weakness , age and death smiling from my husband 's smiling face . IAN prances in at the head of the procession . OWAIN , ELEN , ANGUS , BRIGIT and THE PEOPLE follow . PEOPLE The puck , the puck , let Lord Owain slay the puck . We will drink the blood rushing with seed . We will pour fruited blood on the earth . The wedding will then be complete . ANGUS offering OWAIN a sword : My Lord , this is a weapon I have crafted through long nights alone before a single flame . I know it to contain a potent force undreamed by lesser men . The weapon will release the puck goat 's blood which fertile potion will call back the sun . OWAIN My aged friend , I take your sword with thanks . It is an instrument I am glad to have . He turns to BRIGIT . Now I kneel at the feet of one whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every man . Brigit , bless my quest . p. 8 BRIGIT The blessing asked , it is received . Fight well for the sun 's return . OWAIN stands and goes to IAN , the puck , whom two people have been holding . OWAIN Are you ready , puck , to die for life ? IAN lets out a bellow . At this moment an eerie purplish light falls across the space and a huge shadow , having the outlines of a great beast , appears . It is an eclipse of the sun . Suddenly , the play battle gives way to a real sense of terror and dread . ANGUS in fear : A monster has stolen the sun ! BRIGIT It is tall as the mountain is tall . ELEN It is winged and horned . ANGUS Chase the creature of death from the land . THE PEOPLE use their instruments to make a loud , cacophonous noise . IAN Help , ho , what is wrong ? I ca n't see . FIOLA Pieces of flesh fall from its wings . MEENA It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster away who has stolen the sun . He begins to beat IAN with his tambourine. p. 9 IAN Help . Help . It is evil itself . He stumbles around the space . THE PEOPLE chase him , beating him and making noise to scare the " beast " away . VINCENT to ETAIN : Call him to your side ; you 're soon to be the mother of his child . ETAIN My Lord . . . OWAIN Etain , come . Join with those who tend the land . They grow wild at the thought a monster has stolen the sun . Their fear of winter 's darkness must be overcome . BRIGIT tossing a tambourine to OWAIN : Owain , Etain , come . ETAIN Stay by my side . The loss of the sun and their thunderous noise frightens the child in my womb . ANGUS Chase the omen of death from the land . ETAIN Owain , stay . The sky grows darker and I tremble at the madness in the air . I am close to my time . OWAIN Join your fear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fear but enter in a wild dance with the unknown . ETAIN The child feels dead against my flesh . Owain , stay . p. 10 BRIGIT Etain , flaunt your ripened self at death . Owain , come , I 've never called you when you disobeyed . OWAIN joins the crowd . ANGUS Chase the creature of death from the land . ETAIN It is a godless noise they make and godless words they speak . Go , then , my godless man , run wild with the wild pack . BRIGIT , ELEN , OWAIN and all chase IAN out of the space , making a loud noise and calling upon the beast to give up the sun . VINCENT helping ETAIN get down on her knees : We can outlast their madness with our prayer . Some say the moon eclipsed the sun the day our Lord was born . Let this be a portent for your babe . From the dark hole carved into the sky heaven 's light appears . ETAIN An old woman , toothless and bent , stirs his desire more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his child . VINCENT Lacking God as he does , he weakens from a wild woman 's call . She was his midwife and his nurse . She holds him taut within her grasp . ETAIN And I , who hold his future here , am more to be feared . p. 11 VINCENT You are the temptress who stole his seed . The old one , the mother who renews . ETAIN Growing round I have become the monster who eats up the sun . I am the dragon shape he must escape . So he hides himself between the virgin flatness of his maid and sterile wisdom of the crone . The light returns to normal . The people are heard playing a simple tune of joy on flutes and stringed instruments . They wander back into the space . BRIGIT Etain , I called for you and Owain both . I did not mean to set my lure against your own . ETAIN He has made his choice . OWAIN entering with ELEN , he approaches ETAIN : See , it is done . The sun regains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better face the long , dark wait till spring . So it is with us , Etain , if you can but trust my monstrous heart , nothing will end . ANGUS and IAN enter . IAN carries the puck 's head . ANGUS and he pass a wineskin between them . ETAIN My Lord , I am close to my time . I am overcome by thoughts I would have freedom from . I am not at ease surrounded by a crowd who makes our business theirs . to VINCENT Take me into the house ; I must rest . As they start to exit , the sound of the crow is heard. p. 12 BRIGIT Come , Owain , we will follow the call of that crow . I am full of mysterious things I would have you know . As they are leaving , ELEN approaches . ELEN Owain , take me with you . OWAIN I am called by the voice of the crow to go where the crow 's voice leads . Elen , leave me go . Look to your work , now , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels repaired by tomorrow morn . Women , I would have all of the old wool spun before the child is born . Shepherd , since you 're here , I would set you to cleaning the barn . BRIGIT and OWAIN go . All but IAN , ANGUS and ELEN drift away to work . IAN Say , carver , and carver 's daughter , all is not well between the lord and his lady . So he runs off with Brigit the seer and dumps all his wrath on the poor . Sure what else does he keep us for ? The lords and ladies could work as well as we , but then they 'd have no one to blame for the sorrows they cause and no one to look down on when they feel bad . ANGUS Elen , are you ill ? ELEN What makes you ask ? ANGUS Did n't you hear the shepherd just say all is not well between the lord and his lady . Are you sick , girl ? p. 13 ELEN I 'm fine , father , fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl answer : All is well between the lord and his lady . All is plump , young and healthy that has come between the lord and his lady . ELEN Stop . Will you let me alone . I 'm tired from all that has passed . I do n't want to hear your wagging tongue . ANGUS Tired , eh . Something could have happened to you I never allowed . Do you sit there and mope because a seed in your belly turns you sickly and weak ? ELEN Leave me alone . IAN who has been standing about uncomfortably the whole time : Uh , that 's just what I thought I 'd do . My flock must be scattered all over the mountain . Here 's your head back , carver . I acted my part quite well , do n't you think ? It 's all left me with much to consider . But my own wife 's with child and close to her time to deliver . He leaves . ANGUS Even that simpleton spills his seed into fertile ground , while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed in my hand . ELEN Your talk makes me sick . ANGUS When I spoke praise to your perfect fingers and slender toes you loved to hear me talk . You loved to lie in my arms smiling up at my words . I could have sired your child , but I held myself back . I could have kept you for mine , but I let you go to a lord who favored you for a month , then left you without a word . p. 14 ELEN No man could use me more ill than you have done . ANGUS Elen , no man will ever love you as I do to this day . No man 's love could begin as mine did . ELEN I 've work to do . I 've no time to listen to you . She turns to go ; he stops her . ANGUS Your mother died the hour you were born . Brigit , weeping , gave you to my arms . I was a lad , the girl I loved had died . I paced the fields and ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief to all life 's living things . One by one they each gave back a call : " Joy , joy , joy , " the sea birds and the wood birds sang . " Joy for what you cradle in your arms . " " Joy , " called the wave that pounded on the shore . " Joy , " the bitter wind replied . I keened my grief aloud . All life answered , " Joy . " " You hold what matters now within your arms . Joy for what endures past death . " You turned your face into my breast . I sat down upon a rocky ledge and let the waves repeat the thunderous call . " Joy for what is , " they beat against the shore . I rocked you gently in my arms . I never loved a woman , child , better than I have loved you . ELEN I was your daughter , not your concubine or wife . ANGUS I loved you , Elen , what else could I do ? p. 15 ELEN Your love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I trembled when I heard you come . You forced yourself on me , but now I 'm grown . Sit there like a withered branch . Stare down at the ugly head you made and think what you have meant by love . She exits . ANGUS Because I treated you as if you were a queen you turn on me in scorn when you are grown . I would have loved you better , if I could . I cared for you the only way I knew . p. 16 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO BRIGIT and OWAIN approach the ancient burial spot , which is marked by a dolmen , rising out of the rocks . BRIGIT Once I carried you , slung between my breasts and danced here through the night . Now the rocks pierce the soles of my feet and the wind reminds me of death . OWAIN Once we danced together in this spot , our breath billowing up . We were the crystal waves that leapt from the depths of the sea to shatter in brilliant shapes for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much is lost , so I have brought you here as if to dream the future of some unbegotten race . This much is known , and not much else : how I caught you from your mother 's heaving womb to bear you at my breast . How you stood shaking with desire when I aroused your sex , then journeyed to the center of the earth to spill your virgin seed into that whirling space . How life and death seemed one to you that once . All this is known , but nothing else , so I have brought you here as if to dream the future of an unbegotten race . OWAIN Once I knelt in awe before your shape . He kneels . I stared at the weight and motion of your breasts and felt my own shape change . p. 17 BRIGIT Now a passage into yet another form is asked . The hungry child sucking at my breast , the long-haired youth delighting in the dance have grown into a man whose time to father the unknown is come . OWAIN Is Etain already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BRIGIT I have watched . I have not said a word . Etain kneels in prayer on the cold stones ; she follows the bird 's flight with her eyes . OWAIN Etain grew large and quiet and unknown before my sight ; so I turned from what I could not understand . BRIGIT And sought a new love out . OWAIN As you sought me when you , too , felt a need to bond with something vibrant and untouched . BRIGIT I have watched and have not said a word . OWAIN Did you know a charm that would have kept my love for her alive ? BRIGIT Three things only do I know : the love of the moment we cherish and keep ; the love of what was and will never come back ; the torturous love of the unborn . This last I would share with you . OWAIN Come to me for one instant out of time . Let us be once more as we were , a girlish youth gasping with wonder and the wise woman he lay under . p. 18 BRIGIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was and has been forgot . OWAIN Take me back beyond that midnight spring when the moon lay open and full to a time I lay snug in your arms and the world was an orb of milk-like flesh and milky smells . BRIGIT Back , further back in your heart . Back beyond time or regret . You will lend your flesh and your bones to the greed of what is unborn . OWAIN squats on the ground . Entranced by BRIGIT , he feels himself to be pregnant and he begins to be aware of his growing belly , his ripe heaviness . Completing the spell , BRIGIT sings the song of the solitary birth . The crow-women emerge from behind the dolmen to sing with her . They hover around OWAIN . OWAIN grows round and heavy , as BRIGIT sings . His labor pains begin , and he works to deliver the " child , " finally easing it out from between his legs and biting the umbilical cord . On a wind-swept hill on a mountain plain washed by the salt of the sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pig , mare , goat , woman alone  --  squatted down to give birth . How many times has this story been told , how few the listeners ? How many times has the labor been made to the sound of the wind and the song of the birds ? She who brought forth the unknown , how many times did she shiver and shake , caught in the moment of birth , the effort that knows one release , form out of form , fear raising love ? When the lonely work was done , when she had licked the infant clean , who was there on that lonely plain to marvel at what had been made ? A bandy-legged calf , a sniveling runt , an unwanted puck , a son to be feared , a daughter scorned . The lonely one and the work of her heart rage at the welcoming wind . OWAIN wakes . He sees the " babe " he has birthed . He cradles and welcomes the " child . " p. 19 OWAIN Hello , little babe , little beast , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from ? A moment before you were only the faith that the effort would end and a child would be born . Your wet head slithers across my chest . Your fingers grasp at my flesh . Your eyes blink open and stare . You are life looking up , crawling up out of your well . You have come from the mud , from the ocean 's dark you have come , a beast flung down from the sky , spewed from the lava foam . How did you dare to trust a love I never have known would anchor your heart in my own ? OWAIN rocks the child , when suddenly the crows begin to caw . What is that sound ? The crowd , the world that calls me from the task of birth . Away , away , I am not weak . I have not sacrificed my strength . Away , away you flat-beaked crows . Stop your screeching , jeering song . He throws the " child " against the rocks , and in a fury chases the birds . Begone you evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , dead image of an unlived life , away . Leave me as I was , a man whose mute and shuttered loins hold fast against unknown , unwanted things . BRIGIT Hush , Owain , hush . Before the rage which is all you can remember now lived an image barely touched , inside you still . Owain , awake , you have been to the source , turned and fled , but the source of that devouring delight will one day claim you for her own . Not the birth , but love of the birth , not the child , but awe of the child , not the effort , but reverence before it , are yours . The dawn has come . A bird 's song is heard and MACHA answers it . She is seen in the distance , heavy with child . A young lamb is slung across her back . She leaps across the rocks. p. 20 OWAIN Who is that ? BRIGIT It is Macha , the poor shepherd 's wife . OWAIN She strides with the grace of the wind or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIGIT She is half-tamed . She sings with the wildest of birds . She runs with the hind and the fox . OWAIN Why have I not seen her before ? BRIGIT Her strength bids her keep to herself . OWAIN Where is she from ? She is not of this place . BRIGIT She came down from the mountain last year to ease the poor shepherd who lived alone . She grew fond of the one she had found ; now she carries a child under her heart . Come , the dawn has played itself out . Macha is gone from our sight . I am called by the light of the sun back to the tasks of the day . OWAIN Go by yourself back to the house . I would seek out that poor shepherd 's flock . p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE ETAIN and BROTHER VINCENT are walking in the yard , in front of the house . They hear the cry MACHA has made as she runs down to the barn with the lamb . ETAIN Hush , do you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where has the wild thing gone ? Alone out from the shore , flaunting its delicate strength , dipping a silver wing toward certain death in the waves , soaring up , risking death in the wind . Where has the wild thing gone ? Why has it left me alone ? VINCENT Hush , Etain , hush . The bird will return ; I can chart its flight in your eyes . The bird will return to sing at the birth of your child . ETAIN Why does that cry turn sour in my dreams ; why does death haunt me so , if I am sheltered , as you say , sheltered by merciful God ? VINCENT Etain , kneel down . We will pray for that bird 's return . ETAIN I dreamt last night of that cry , turned terrible and cold . I dreamt of the carrion crow that picks out the eyes of the new-born lambs and leaves the sheep wild in the pasture below . I dreamt of a screaming crow , lodged in my womb , eating my flesh . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with its call , its beak driven deep , as if I am nailed to it . p. 22 VINCENT You can dislodge that bird with a thought , banish it , send it away , make it a creature of day . I have heard of a kind of bird where the female lays the eggs , then the male sits on them . The male bird hatches the young , feeds and cares for them . ETAIN You would like that , Brother Vincent . VINCENT I would . How better could a day 's prayers be brought to an end than by the furious pecking at my backside of the new-born crying for food . ETAIN My eggs safe in your nest , I would fly out over the sea , spiralling up in a dance , to the island beyond the waves where all are lovely and young and no death comes . If only we were those birds . VINCENT God has made us as we are . ETAIN Are we not bound by our forms to duties we each would disown ? VINCENT We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters , heavy with child , the small lamb slung across her back . MACHA I would just go into the barn . I have brought down a lamb born too late in the year to survive to a withered old ewe who is dry . I would just go into the barn and find a warm teat for its mouth . Exits. p. 23 ETAIN Who is that ? She carries a lamb from the hills on her back as simply as she carries her child . VINCENT A poor shepherd 's wife , grown strong from a hard , dull life . ETAIN Leave me , Brother Vincent , our prayers are done . VINCENT You should not be left alone in the cold morning air and your time so close . ETAIN Leave me . I will speak to the one in the barn . VINCENT What would you say to her who 's never been near the mass , who scorns the sacraments ? What would she say to you but foolishness ? ETAIN The will of a woman heavy with child should not be crossed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the good milk will sour in its mouth . She sees MACHA by the barn door . Woman , is n't this so ? MACHA I have heard that to cross a woman heavy with child is to bring a long curse on the house . VINCENT Enough of this talk . Come with me , now . ETAIN A few minutes alone , Brother Vincent ; go . My time is near . I wo n't be out again in the air . He goes . There is silence between the two pregnant women. p. 24 ETAIN You are a shepherd 's wife ? MACHA I tend sheep , lambs and goats . ETAIN You carry a shepherd 's child ? MACHA I carry the child I have desired . ETAIN Where are you from ? MACHA The blue mountain risen there under the sun . ETAIN You walked to the plain with a lamb on your back and your belly full of a child . MACHA I walked and I ran . I rested myself in the morning sun . The beat of the heart of the lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unborn were like a great song in the world . ETAIN What made you come ? MACHA There 's frost in the hills . A lamb born this late in the year would n't live with a ewe too old to nurse . ETAIN So you left your bed and your hearth to carry a lamb to the barn on your back ? MACHA I am called by the sound of the sea as the wave inside myself breaks . I wished to come down to the shore . The lamb 's need was only my own . Do n't you feel the same desire to squat by the ocean 's gate and , one with the endless tide , deliver what you have made ? p. 25 ETAIN I feel no desire at all but to be free of this weight . MACHA approaching her : Yes , it is time . Has your belly been rubbed by someone who sees the beauty that weight brings to your bearing and to your face ? ETAIN I have kept to myself these changing months . I have not wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will trace the lines of your child with my hands . I will draw on your silken flesh the beauty of what you have made . ETAIN sits next to her . MACHA begins to rub her stomach . She feels about , high up and to one side . Here are limbs , stretching themselves in the golden warmth of the womb . She feels lower down . Here , the head , being brave , already pointed at the earth . She lays her head on ETAIN 's stomach . And the heart , bold and strong . What a fine child you 've grown . ETAIN Is it ready to be born ? MACHA Soon , very soon . A day or two or a week . It 's something we do not know  --  why the birth starts and when , what dream the child dreams in that sheltered spot that pushes it out toward life . p. 26 ETAIN Will it be a boy or a girl ? MACHA I would guess from your shape and the sound of the heart you carry a son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? ETAIN reaches to MACHA 's stomach now and traces her child as she speaks . ETAIN Why , someday , when they are grown these two can bring forth their own . They would make a child of ours , as if we had coupled here in the sun and left a delicate sprout , conceived by a touch and a wish . MACHA Soon we will sit side by side at the shore bound by our babes ; wedded by them we will sit , smiling at dreams that well up in the silver spray of the waves , entranced by the life we have made . ETAIN Perhaps all will be as you say . Tell me of the birth of the lamb . MACHA The sun was trapped by the moon when I heard the ewe call . I sat in that purple light rubbing her warm belly with my hand . Sometimes she would turn to look in my eyes and I 'd answer her look with my own . Then she began . ETAIN Did she cry out in pain ? As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes like the ewe , totally involved in the birth effort , animal-like , and she experiences , for a moment , all of the fire , the pride and the brute force that might have been hers. p. 27 MACHA She dug her feet into the earth . She hunched and her belly grew tight with each push . She parted her lips and her breath gave rise to the song of the birth . MACHA sings and she supports ETAIN 's effort . Five months , little lamb , I have carried you under my heart . Five months , little lamb , you have weighted me close to the earth . Each step that I took was echoed by your shifting weight . Each fright found a place deep inside me ; each joy that I had was silently shared . Drop down , little lamb , you have lived for five months in my darkness . There has been nothing between us but trust . Drop down , little lamb , for the time of not knowing is ended . What has fashioned itself of my flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETAIN pushes , as if she were the ewe , completely animal in her effort . She makes the grunting , groaning cry of birth , delivers the lamb and rests . As the light came back to the sky , she leaned back her head and smiled . She smiled as if she knew effort is love and death must lose in the end . She nudged the lamb up on its feet . It stumbled and grabbed at her teat . ETAIN She is herself again : It was as simple as that . As if she were wind or wave , and joyously proud in her pain . MACHA It was as simple as it seemed . All her sorrow was yet to come . But that 's a tale for another morn . p. 28 ETAIN The ewe died from the birth . MACHA She did not . ETAIN She died from the effort she made , died from the thing she had done , died from the force of her cry . MACHA The ewe lives as sure as the lamb . The birth was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did you steal the babe she had birthed ? Did you take away what she loved ? Did you punish the ewe for the wildness she knew ? MACHA What trickled out of her teat was yellowed , sour old milk . The lamb took one drink and cried . It bleated its hunger up to the sky . The ewe shrieked with anger and fear . She could not feed the thing she 'd birthed . She rushed at the cowering lamb . She kicked , she bit , she yelled . I picked up the poor turned-on thing . I slung the lamb over my back . ETAIN singing the song of the bereaved ewe , becoming as she sings , that animal once more , wild with grief this time , tossing her head . But by the end of the song she is once more passive and resigned : What I bore in my belly with fear she bears on her back with pride . The woman strides off with all that I am ; she leaves me with nothing at all . What does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in myself yet bore that brutal desire in silence , as if it were pride . What does she care that I shattered myself and poured my blood out on the earth . She steals all I have birthed . What does she care that the effort I made was more than I could endure , that the cry that stuck in my throat was the cry of the carrion bird and all I had dreamed of or hoped devoured itself in that cry . A loud and terrible scream is heard . ETAIN flinches . MACHA goes to her . ETAIN draws back. p. 29 MACHA It is but the aching branch of an old tree falling away under the weight of the frost . ETAIN It is nothing with form . It is something that has not been . MACHA It is but rocks resettling , or the earth shifting . ETAIN Do not lie . It is grief . MACHA It is over and gone . ETAIN It will return . MACHA No , it has fled . ETAIN It is sorrow . It will come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is gone . The sound comes again . It is a crying in ETAIN 's womb . ETAIN It is the child in my womb . MACHA It is yourself . Do not fear . ETAIN It is the babe , crying for comfort it has not had . MACHA Sing , Etain , sing . Not of the pitiful ewe . Sing songs of comfort for all that must live . ETAIN Stop torturing me with your strength . You mock at my need . You deny that a woman is frightened and weak . Go . Leave me alone . The child cries in the womb . There is nothing to do . He knows me better than you . The cry comes again . VINCENT enters p. 30 VINCENT What is that sound ? BRIGIT enters from the other side . BRIGIT Why is there crying in the womb ? ETAIN She has taken all that I am . MACHA I take nothing I would not return . VINCENT What evil have you practiced in this place ? Even as she weakens , you grow strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed yourself from my form . VINCENT Come , Etain , into the house . We will pray . You 'll soon be yourself . Midwife , follow us . Shepherdess , go from this place . VINCENT and ETAIN exit . MACHA You are her midwife , yet you 've let her grow crazed with fear . Shame on you , woman , shame . Did you hold her in your arms ? Did you rock her to sleep ? Did you call her " goddess of life , " " giantess with two hearts " ? Did you rejoice in her strength , or pride her on her size ? Did you sing to her , laugh with her , cry ? Did you stand silent in awe at the miracle she will unfold ? You have done none of these things . When the pain comes that rips her in two , midwife , what cure will you have ? Will you drug her with herbs so she will not learn of her glorious strength ? Will you rip the babe from her unwilling flesh , force it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile to yourself ? p. 31 BRIGIT Wild woman , why have you come down from the hills to ruin the peace of this place ? Go back where you 've been these many years . Go back to sleep under the rocks . MACHA I 've come , for the women on this land have grown soft and the men have grown hard . I 've come to ask , why ? Why have you turned from a woman in need , midwife , why ? BRIGIT She is not of this land . She came with the monk on her arm . She would listen to nothing I said . It was she took my power away . Even you in your rage have not the strength to bring back a power that is feared . Go away back to your flock , away from this house . I will go to Etain and do what I can . p. 32 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR OWAIN comes upon IAN where he is tending the flock . IAN singing : The morning brings the sun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheep and the shepherd are glad . All fear of the darkness is gone and has fled . The morning has brought back the sun . The dark and the cold are beaten back by the sun . OWAIN There sits a happy man . IAN Tired and cold from a long night alone but pleased at the sight of the sun . Will you share food fit for a king ? There 's a spring with clear water . My wife 's bread is equalled by no other . OWAIN You bid me good welcome to this spot . Where is your wife ? IAN She has run off with a lamb on her back . She will return before night . She is swifter than wind . OWAIN A boast like that ill fits an honest man . IAN I speak only the truth . Though she carries my child in her womb , and has slung a young lamb on her back , she runs with the grace of the hind and the speed of the morning light . p. 33 OWAIN You mock me with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman you describe . IAN I speak only the truth . No lie could out-distance my wife . OWAIN How did you find such a mate ? IAN Ah , that is the strangest tale there is . One day when the evening sky was dressed in gold , in red , in purple , vermillion and blue , she stood at my door . Clothed in the rays of the setting sun , wrapped in a mantle of shimmering hair , she seemed an image of a lost race when people were taller and grander than now and lived to a hundred or more , when wisdom and wonderful songs flew like hurrying flocks from their tongues ruffling the air . She stood silent and proud at my door . She entered the hut , bringing with her the glorious light . The hut seemed to grow grand , like a crystal castle set next to a bubbling stream . She graced it like an ancient queen . From that day to this she has lived in my house and not a harsh word have we spoken or thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side why she sought me instead of a king . She turned her head toward the moon , smiled and said , " The moon , the wind , the sun , the sea and my self ; this house , the flock and a tender touch are finer than riches to me . " From that one wondrous night a child has begun to take form . And she , who carries the load , becomes swifter , wiser , more proud and fairer than ever before . Now her smile itself is like light ; she leaps with the hind on the rocks , answers the birds with her songs , and cradles the ewes in her arms . p. 34 OWAIN You are a victim of love . Your love makes you lie . No mortal woman has half the virtues you describe . IAN On my honor as an honest man , I have not yet begun to praise her . OWAIN No woman with child is swifter than a hind . No woman with child is as proud . I have seen them grow weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races the wind . IAN No woman but this one woman , perhaps , and she an image of all the pride and the strength that is past . OWAIN You anger me with your boasts . I would have you be quiet or prove what you say . IAN Sit with me through the day ; at evening you 'll see her return . You 'll learn of her speed , her silver tongue and the courage with which she carries her young . OWAIN You make her sound braver than any man . IAN That may well be . For I 've not heard the tale that equals her own . OWAIN You will prove what you say . IAN One look at her glorious self will make my words weak . She can out-wrestle any man and not lose the smile on her face . OWAIN There is no man alive who can out-wrestle me. p. 35 IAN No man , perhaps , Lord . No man , at all . OWAIN And no shepherd 's wife . IAN Oh , yes , Sire , she can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow it . OWAIN Man , I will wrestle your wife or string you up by your hair on a tree , sever your head from your limbs and let your mouth hang open to mock your boast . IAN Lord , surely you jest . OWAIN I will wrestle the woman you claim as your wife . IAN Who is my wife , Lord . It 's my child inside her . For the sake of the unborn , Sire , let the match be put off until she delivers . OWAIN The match will take place as soon as we find her , or you will not live until dinner . IAN Lord , please , you frighten a man who 's done well in your service . This flock is healthy and large . My tribute is always fully paid . OWAIN How do you know the seed she carries is yours ? How close to her have you actually been ? IAN Closer than any man since she came to this land . Closer yet than I am to my death , is that not so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . A woman who 's swifter than wind , stronger than men , carries no child of a shepherd inside her ; the soul of a shepherd lodged under her heart would make her docile and meek . She would grow cow-like and dumb if she carried your son . IAN Yes , Sire , yes . Let 's forget about me and my wife . She 's most apt to be snoring right now under some tree , the flies buzzing thick round her puffed-out eyes , licking the sweet drool from her mouth . OWAIN Your boasts ring in my ears . Though I asked you to stop , you could not . I have seen the woman you describe ; though I would not fain call her your wife , I will wrestle her for your life . Come . We will seek her out where she hides . OWAIN takes IAN by the arm and leads him off. p. 37 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE In the yard outside LORD OWAIN 's house . ELEN sits , honing an ax . ELEN singing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red poppies and dark violets . O , the blood that waters the ground will grow up a garden from dust and from rock . O , the blood , the red blood that falls from your wounds will wash the earth clear of the crimes I 've whispered to no one , year after year ; I 've whispered to no one , for no one could hear . O , the blood from your neck that waters the earth will fall like rain on the stalk . All that has frozen and died will grow fresh in the balm of your blood . The blood , the warm blood will bring back the spring and wash the earth clean of the crimes I 've whispered to no one year after year ; I 've whispered to no one , for no one could hear . BRIGIT enters with a basket of herbs . BRIGIT Elen , has Owain gone into the house ? ELEN No one has cast a shadow on the step since the sun came up . p. 38 BRIGIT Pah ! She spits . Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will not open herself to let the babe be born . ELEN Is she going to die ? BRIGIT That I ca n't tell . I 've ergot and rue . Each will help push the child out of the womb . But I have n't found the fungus or herb that will give her desire to live . ELEN Brigit , I had to do what I did . I had to take Owain for mine . BRIGIT Aye , he 's handsome and strong . You 're lovely and young . No woman knows till it happens to her the pain of a faithless man . ELEN If all that had happened to me was to be left by a man , you would n't see me honing an ax to sever his head . Owain was only a sham , someone to barter . My lover has been my father . Angus has been my lover , the only man who caused me to feel twined hate and desire like a rope round my heart . Heal that with your charms and your herbs . Heal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept you from seeing all these years . I 'll heal my hate with this ax . BRIGIT Elen , what kept you from coming to me ? ELEN Go to you who praised each ugly head he carved ? What would you have done ? p. 39 BRIGIT I would have stopped him had I known . ELEN He made me promise not to tell . He kept me silent in his spell . While you who brewed the remedies for all my childhood ills ; you , who brought me into this world , never asked the reason why I kept you many nights beside my bed . BRIGIT My own need lay too full upon my breast . I should have known his love for his sweet babe was more than he could bear . ELEN How can you defend him even now ? BRIGIT Not defend him , Elen , only think what life has done . ELEN I was your rival for his love those years . I was the one who triumphed over you . BRIGIT You were a child . I was captive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his own child . ELEN He told me I was wiser than the wisest woman alive . He told me I was born with knowledge of the ways of love . BRIGIT He lied . ELEN He told me I desired each caress ; he said my writhing body kept his hand upon my flesh . I was born to pleasure him , he said . BRIGIT He lied . You were a child , born innocent and sweet . p. 40 ELEN You gave me to his grasp . You turned away , and I gave all my love to him . If I cared how you betrayed my trust I would be sharpening this ax to move along your throat . But , so help me , Brigit , I do not . BRIGIT Elen , listen , if you can . You are blameless ; you have always been . ELEN Stop ! I learned how at my father 's knee , and I seduced the king . I am her murderess . I took her love away as surely as I once took yours from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lived . And she will do what she must do . But I must go to her and bring these herbs . Elen , put the ax down . I have a simpler revenge . I have herbs in my bag you can mix and put in his mead . They will bring on a fever that will leave him unmanned . Put the ax down . Try this potion first . Let him live with time to reflect what he 's done . And let you live free of the murderer 's curse . You have enough to carry in your heart , and I in mine . VINCENT comes from the house . VINCENT Where have you been ? Etain is awake . She cries in her pains . Come into the house . BRIGIT Elen , do as I asked . One part of each of these herbs . Boil , then cool . I am more helpless before Etain 's rage than I am before yours . The murder she plans is harder still to undo . She exits with VINCENT. p. 41 Act 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its base , singing amidst the songs of the birds . MACHA There go the crows in the sky . One for sorrow . Two for joy . Three for a girl . Four for a boy . What will you be , little bird that lives in my nest  --  a creature like myself , or a man-child , strange and unknown ? A woman of sorrow and comfort and joy , or a man-child , silent , withdrawn , frightened , thinking he 's strong ? If you 're a boy , little lamb , little bird , humming inside my flesh , if you 're a boy , not one like myself , as known as I am known , what can I do to help you remain a child of sorrow and comfort and joy ? What can I do , as you grow to a man , to help you be known to yourself , to live your mystery through , to give of your warmth , your sorrow , your joy to all who would ask it of you ? OWAIN and IAN approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard nothing , Sire . OWAIN Come , man , stop lying . p. 42 IAN O , the song of the crows . Certainly , Sire , I did hear the singing of birds . OWAIN And a woman 's voice among them . IAN That I did not hear . We are but a mile from the barn , where Macha has gone with the lamb . Let us make haste . OWAIN There 's a woman alone by the dolmen . That is the woman I saw . Is that woman your " wife " ? IAN My wife went down to the barn . I would seek her there . OWAIN Look . What do you see ? Describe that woman to me . IAN Which woman , Lord ? My wife , or that shadow against the rock . OWAIN Are they not the same ? MACHA Must you stand in the midst of the morning sun and disrupt the birds ' calls with your quarrel ? I am the woman you seek , if you seek after Macha herself . OWAIN I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACHA I have asked him not to be bragging . OWAIN If he lied , he will pay , for he angered me with his words . MACHA What could a poor shepherd say to anger someone proud as a king ? p. 43 OWAIN He spoke at great length of the beauty and strength of his wife , till it came to my mind that if such a woman lived she ought to be wife of a lord . MACHA She ought to be wife of no man , but a creature unto herself . OWAIN The shepherd has said his wife could defeat Owain himself . MACHA to IAN : Did you say that ? IAN I only praised your wondrous ways . You know how I am with words , if one rolls easily off my tongue a thousand and one rush behind it . Oh , I wove a wondrous web . You would have loved how I spoke , for you love to hear yourself praised when we sit by the fire in the glade . Should I die for my glorious words , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has only imagined my strength . It 's natural enough , alone with the sheep , to weave songs and wonderful myths . OWAIN I saw you at dawn , racing the sun to the barn . This shepherd you seek to protect has bartered his life for his wife . Wrestle me or he dies for his boast . MACHA Gladly , my Lord . I will meet you in one month 's time . OWAIN You will meet me this day . p. 44 MACHA I am heavy with child . I would not wrestle now . OWAIN Then he dies for his brag . Come , man , say goodbye to your wife . IAN Macha , please , do as he says . I tremble so hard for my life . A wife should protect her spouse . You are duty bound to wrestle the Lord . MACHA Ach , you are a weak and stupid man , after all . Are all those of your sex who practice a gentle touch weak in the brain ? I am no more beholden to you than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrow or stone . You bartered your life for a lie . To OWAIN . I am not this man 's wife . Now , go on your way . IAN Macha , please , do n't let me die . I did what I did with no thought of harm . I 'm an innocent man about to be slain . MACHA If you do not sense the evil you do using me as a jewel or coin to purchase your worth over his , I sense not the evil I do letting you die as you should . OWAIN If he is not your husband , I claim you as mine . You are an unprotected woman on my land . MACHA Your land . . . OWAIN Aye , mine , and my father 's before me , and my son 's to come . All who stop here owe obedience to my line . p. 45 MACHA No more than the rain or the wind , or the glorious moon that snatched your sun the other day . I am not of a race that obeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll grant that the woman who dares such a feat belongs to no one but herself . MACHA I have other cares on my mind than proving my strength to a man . OWAIN Refuse and I 'll drive you far from this place and plant this man 's head on a stake in the ground . MACHA This is the place to which I 've come ; this is the place where I belong . OWAIN Wrestle and win , I 'll grant you the right to remain and do as you wish . Wrestle and lose , I 'll make you my queen . Refuse , I 'll drive you away . MACHA We will meet at noon in the yard in front of the house . I would wrestle you close to the one who is your wife . Go , now leave me alone . The men exit . MACHA I do n't suppose you 'd care to be born quite as soon as I 'd wish . O , well , little bird , little lamb , stay where you are . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life what is asked , with no thought of gain or control , and life responds as it will . Stay with me , now , little beast . If I grow frightened or tense , sing to me with yourself . Startle me with your kicks . Beat your wings under my heart . Bind me to life . Come , now , we need to deck ourselves out for the battle we 're bound to win . But why , little one , are these men either foolish or hard ? What is the thrill of their cruel ways ? And why do they fear a woman grown heavy with child ? p. 46 p. 47 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN MACHA girds for the fight . She walks from the dolmen to Angus 's workplace , to the yard in front of OWAIN 's house . MACHA No matter , my child . What a tale you 'll have to tell when you 're old , how before you were born you battled a lord for the right to belong to yourself . We 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black from the raven 's back , red from the cardinal 's breast , grey from the swallow 's wings , blue from the throat of the jay , silver brought from the sea by the gull ; woven by threads of lichen and moss into a wonderful cloak . MACHA stoops and picks up from the ground a cloak of feathers in beautiful bright colors . She puts it on and approaches ANGUS 's yard . He is at work , carving . MACHA Carve me the mask of a crow , quickly now . ANGUS Ho , who might you be ? You 're not a human woman at all , I 'm thinking , but a fairy queen come from the hills of the sidhe . MACHA Make me the mask as I 've asked , quick as you can . ANGUS working to fashion a crow 's mask : Yes , my lady , right away . It 's an honor to serve the fairy folk . I 'm a poor man with an unmarried daughter to care for but I do n't ask for payment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were offered . Gold 's fit payment for grave-stones , coffins and crosses . But gold for the face of a crow to hide a goddess 's brow is no proper payment at all . I 'm touched to be asked , truly I am . I think you 'll be pleased with my craft . There are n't many around with the skill to perform such a task , but I 'm specially trained in the ritual making of masks . I understand , if you 'll pardon my frankness , how without a mask , even a goddess . . . People need to be shown what to believe . This is a visual age . When I was a boy a story would do just as well . But no more . Now it 's the splendid effects that stir up the hearts of the crowd . He holds the mask up to her face , then resumes work on it . I hope you 'll remember me well to the race that dwells under the hill , beyond the wave , in all hidden corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I wonder if a cup of their magic wine might be left on my threshold some night ? The kind that keeps them eternally young . Barely enough to quench a slight thirst is all that I ask . Just enough to bring back my youth . He fits the mask to her face . There you are . The glorious mask of a crow . The bird that knows more than we know . Whoever looks straight into the eyes of a crow is bewitched on the spot . A fine piece of work , if I say so myself . Do n't thank me , now . I 've skills to share with the fairy folk . Perhaps you 'll remember my words . If they could spare a cup of that drink , I 'd delight in the thought that my flesh might remain as alive and alert as the spirit I put in my work . MACHA vanishes ; ANGUS leaps with joy . It 's done . One glass of fairy wine , I will be young . Young enough to beat young Owain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will win . The hunt , the crown , the women he takes to bed will all be mine . p. 48 ELEN carrying a cup full of drink : Father , who are you talking to ? ANGUS A woman come from the sidhe . I asked for a cup of their wine , the kind that keeps them eternally young , if you know what I mean . I carved her a wonderful mask . I took no payment at all . ELEN offering him the cup : It 's no fairy drink , but it has a healing effect . It 's passable good , with a strong effect on the glands . ANGUS You are a good girl , Elen , are n't you now . You do care about your father after all . He takes a long , deep drink. p. 49 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT MACHA approaches the yard . As she comes , everyone comes . OWAIN , IAN , ELEN , ANGUS , VINCENT , the CROW-WOMEN gather , waiting for her . Only BRIGIT and ETAIN are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OWAIN I will be with her soon . I have business with one who comes from the mountain beyond , who taunts and who chides with her strength  --  who , I have heard , caused Etain to grow weak . MACHA appears , in cloak and mask , her body oiled , her breasts exposed , her belly big . She stands , ready to fight , in front of OWAIN . You come like a goddess to me . MACHA As you have dreamed me , I have come . As you have feared , I am . OWAIN stripping : Now the fight begins between desire and will . MACHA Now the fight must start between the conquered and the unconquered heart . They begin to circle one another , as wrestlers . OWAIN You are the earth and I , the sky . Under my light you grow fertile and rich . p. 50 MACHA I am the sea that holds all life in its womb . You are the restless need to be born and to die . OWAIN You are what was when the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the tribe . MACHA I am the force inside the rock , the wave , the flight of the bird . OWAIN I am the striving heart , casting desire out of itself . MACHA I am the force you can neither grasp nor escape . OWAIN I am the need for a glory not of this world . MACHA I am only what is , despised and disfigured by need . OWAIN I am man in battle with fear . MACHA I am life , the thing feared . OWAIN You are the one who taunts , who goads . MACHA You are the taunted , wounded by loss . OWAIN This is the fight that has always been . MACHA Between the birther and the one born . OWAIN This the struggle that has no end . They begin the wrestling match . It is done in silence and continues for a long time . The two shining bodies , one lithe , one large with child , lock and entwine in all manner of positions . Their fight is half sexual , half brutal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce , elemental beauty . The fight finally ceases when OWAIN is pinned to the ground . In this position , he seems MACHA 's child at last . From the house there is a loud , anguished cry . BRIGIT appears , and the focus shifts to her ; she carries the newborn son. p. 51 BRIGIT Your fight is senseless , ageless , without end . A woman has just died . And all of you who mocked her , who held yourselves apart or different from her  --  you , too , are dead inside , are deadened by the terrible death she died , died in pain upon her birthing bed . I gave her herbs to drink . I caressed the lips that parted to expose the child 's head . I chanted and placed straw beneath her bed . None of the old ways worked . She sought out pain and death as if pain and death alone spoke in words she understood . " I 've sinned , " she screamed . " I have been wild , animal-like . I 've sinned or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh with oil . She stiffened underneath my hand . " The punishment for sin is death , " she cried . " There is no sin , " I said . She pushed my head away . " You lie . " I saw the corpse give up the child . The woman dead delivered him safely from her gravid womb . THE PEOPLE set up a keening wail . They go to claim the body of ETAIN , leaving MACHA and OWAIN . MACHA My labor has begun . I leave you as you left Etain . But as victor in the fight she lost I have power to curse you , power I will use . From this day on you will be changed as any woman-girl who changes to the mother she has sought . Each time you try to prove your strength you will be as overcome as any woman giving birth . You have lost the power to fight in this fight you lost . Men will mock you and betray you , defeat you , blame you . You will be as helpless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will grow humble in the service of the force that only uses you to manifest itself . p. 52 p. 53 Act 1 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE MACHA has gone to the sea to have her child . The procession approaches the dolmen , bearing the body of ETAIN . They lay her in the earth , but as they try to bury her , the earth rejects the body of the woman dead too soon . The earth heaves up the shape of a woman 's body from beneath itself . It refuses to cover ETAIN . It is as if the earth labors to birth the dead ETAIN . And , in fact , an old Celtic legend says that the earth will refuse the body of someone dead before his time . The people here witness the proof of that legend , and they chant their responses to the awesome event .

Where is my rest , the tortured self demands , if not within the one from which I came ? VINCENT Mary , Mother of God , pray for us now in our hour of need . Etain has died for her sins . WOMEN 'S VOICES Etain , we give you gently to the earth . The earth will wrap her flesh around your own . p. 54 VINCENT The penalty for sin is death . Did she sin against herself ? Mother of God , forgive . ETAIN 's body is thrown violently up from the earth . MEN 'S VOICES The corpse is laid within the earth ; again , the earth throws back the body of Etain . DIEDRE Where is delight for me , where peace , if not within the center of the earth ? WOMEN 'S VOICES Take her back to that most hallowed place , the darkest place , the sheltered place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she decomposes into life . VINCENT The flesh demands our death , the putrid flesh must die . The pure , eternal soul lives . CLEEVNA Take me back into yourself , my mother lost . Let me take root within your moist and sheltered loins . Let me become your child again , breathing as you breath , alive within the darkness of your womb . Again , the body is heaved up from its place of burial . MEN 'S VOICES The earth throws back Etain into our sight . We see the fury of the mother once defied . WOMEN 'S VOICES The earth is raging in her grief , vengeful , violent in her hate of needless death . She trembles underneath us like a scourge . Mother , we are humbled by your rage . p. 55 VINCENT God in heaven , snatch her soul away from all that is corrupt , the heaving earth , the stinking flesh . Redeem the purity in us . MEENA Oh , let me be at peace , at rest . What cause have I to fear ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet smells , the shadow of your loins . Mother , take me home . The men lay the corpse into the earth again . The earth receives the body of ETAIN . MACHA appears with her child in her arms . She comes from the sea where she has given birth . She wears a shimmering silver green gown , translucent over her naked frame . Her hair is long around her shoulders and it glitters with creatures of the sea . She seems taller . She carries her newborn close to her breast . There is silence . MACHA Here is a creature washed from the sea . She came to me singing her name : Etain , Etain . Her song echoed long in my ear ; she came to me singing her name , like tide pounding hard at the shore . Etain , Etain . She wore down my wish to keep her inside . She tore at my flesh , ripped me in two . I am Etain come again , she cried . I opened myself to her call . There is no love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of myself . All that I am , she is . I am the sea , Etain the wave . I am the ground , she is the hill ; I am the sky , she is the sun , the moon . All that has form , she is . I am all that is formless , senseless , wild , all that is feared or desired . She is the hill , the wave , the light . She is the mark of my strength . She is the proof of my love . Silence . The light shifts . It is day once more. @x Twelve years later . Beltane Night , the feast of the spring . Throughout Act II , the flames of a large bonfire are silhouetted in the distance . Dead branches and trees are being burned to herald the new life of the spring . The Beltane fire is also jumped over by those wishing to take into their flesh the power released by the flames . All through the act , the music and singing of the dancers and feasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway down the mountainside from the revels . BROTHER VINCENT is chasing a young boy , CONOR , OWAIN 's son , around the dolmen , trying to catch him . His pants have fallen down around his knees , and he is having trouble escaping the monk . CONOR Damn these pants . Damn them . He hops behind the dolmen . VINCENT Add blasphemy to carnal sin . You 'll be saying the acts of contrition for days . CONOR from behind the dolmen : Please , Brother Vincent , go away . I 'll come to you . I promise I will . VINCENT I 'll come to you since you 're easy to catch . He dashes behind the dolmen . Struggling to get his pants up , CONOR skitters out through the dolmen . He turns and thumbs his nose at the monk. p. 58 CONOR Naaa ! Naaa ! VINCENT Now , where did you go , child with the devil in you ? He sees CONOR , who begins to hop and run away behind the dolmen but who trips on his pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Lord has hobbled you tight as a horse . VINCENT pulls CONOR up . CONOR Damn these pants . Damn them ! If I was still in my shirt I 'd never have been caught . VINCENT Better to damn the hands that were roaming around than damn the man 's dress that makes sinning hard . CONOR You wear a gown easy to lift up and down ! VINCENT I am in control of myself . You are a victim of lust so the good Lord has clothed you in pants . VINCENT pulls CONOR down to his knees . Together , my son , let us pray . VINCENT and CONOR recite the prayer together , the monk in full voice , CONOR weakly and reluctantly . VINCENT AND CONOR " We seek refuge under the protection of your mercies , O Mother of God ; do not reject our supplication in need but save us from perdition , oh you who alone are blessed . " p. 59 VINCENT Louder , lad . The devil 's the only one in earshot of a mumbled prayer . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We seek refuge under the protection of your mercies , O Mother of God ; do not reject our supplication in need but save us from perdition , oh you who alone are blessed . " VINCENT Since you 've suddenly come into full voice , you can recite alone , fifty times . When you are hoarse , we will know the blessed virgin has heard and has responded with blessed quietude . CONOR Fifty times ! No . Please ! My knees will rot from the damp . I 'll take root , I 'll sprout . VINCENT Begin . CONOR Please . Twenty times . I know I 've sinned . VINCENT Are you fully aware of what you 've done ? CONOR " I seek refuge under the protection of your mercies , O Mother of God ; do not reject our supplication in need but save us from perdition , O you who alone are blessed . " Nineteen . VINCENT Forty-nine ! Do you know where I found you committing your sin ? Not two steps away from where , twelve years ago , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was committed to God . Not two steps from where she rests , you lay on your back , spewing your seed upon the earth , dreaming , the good Lord knows of what ! Why , Conor , why did you pick this spot to do the hideous thing that you did ? p. 60 CONOR Everyone 's up in the hills having fun but I 've been forbidden to go . I wanted to hear the music they make . VINCENT So you sprawled across your mother 's grave and committed a carnal sin ! CONOR I lay down and my mind drifted off . VINCENT Bewitched , that 's what you 've been . Bewitched by that woman up in the hills . She left us alone for twelve good years . She comes back , igniting that awful fertility rite , working her evil against Etain 's son ! You are in mortal danger , Conor . OWAIN enters . OWAIN I wo n't have you filling the boy 's head with lies . CONOR running to his father . Without meaning to , OWAIN pulls away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please let me go up to the hills where the fires burn . Do n't they look wonderful grand ? Please , father , please . OWAIN No , Conor , not this year . CONOR Everyone 's there . Angus and Ian , Elen , everyone , playing their harps and their pipes . Brigit 's there , too , father , please . OWAIN I 'm not there , neither are you . p. 61 CONOR I did n't mean to sin , father , truly not . If you let me go , I wo n't sin again , father , I promise I wo n't . VINCENT Conor , go back to the house . We 'll finish your prayers in your room . CONOR falls upon his knees and begins to race through two more prayers to the Blessed Virgin . OWAIN Conor , stop mumbling those words . What have you done ? Answer me , lad . CONOR Please , father , please . Just let me finish these prayers . I 've only to say them forty-seven more times . OWAIN What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bewitched . . . OWAIN Quiet , let him tell me himself . Conor ! CONOR I 've been very bad . OWAIN What have you done ? I will have an answer when I ask . CONOR I did try to stop myself , truly I did . You know how it is when your mind drifts away ; you hear music on the wind . VINCENT The boy has been bewitched by the same woman who bewitched Etain . She comes back and look : he has spilled his seed on his mother 's grave . He has defiled the spot where she lies . p. 62 OWAIN Quiet . I asked for an answer from my son . CONOR I 'm sorry , father . I 'll never do it again . Only do n't say I 've been bewitched . I do n't want my body to rot . OWAIN Get up , lad , get up . So you touch yourself , do you ? Before going to bed ? CONOR nods . Hah ! At other times , too ? CONOR Father , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? OWAIN laughs . At prayers ? CONOR Father . . . OWAIN Answer me , boy . CONOR Sometimes , yes . . . but . . . OWAIN Does it feel good ? CONOR is silent . Does it feel good , I say ! Answer with words . CONOR Yes , father . OWAIN " Yes , father " what ? CONOR Yes , father it feels . . . all right . OWAIN Hah ! You call that bewitched . The boy does what makes him feel good . There 's nothing magic in that . p. 63 VINCENT It 's the spot . The spot . Who lured him here , with music and songs , to sully his mother 's grave ? OWAIN What happens to boys who do what you 've done ? Answer me ! CONOR They go to hell when they die ; the worms eat their flesh . They stink with lust . OWAIN They grow up to be strong men . They grow up to sire sons . What stinks around here are the lies of the monk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home to bed . We have a new colt to break in the morning . CONOR goes . What shame are you pumping into my son ? Accusing him of what you wished you were man enough to have done . Sin ! Nobody here knew what sin was until you came . VINCENT I 'm raising your son as his mother would have wished . In her faith . OWAIN The faith she died from . I should have sent him up to the hills ; he would learn to love the flesh for the pleasure it brings . If Etain had known that she might still be alive . VINCENT Look at those flames , eating the earth , licking away at the sky . Hellfire is loose in those hills . Of course , you kept him away . You sense the evil the wild woman brings . p. 64 OWAIN It 's not evil I sense . VINCENT Have you forgotten the struggle we had to bury Etain in this ground ? You know the wild woman up in the hills and the midwife with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Etain had wanted to live , she would have ; I 'm not freeing myself from the blame , but I 'll not be blaming blameless women . VINCENT Then why are n't you dancing with them ? Why did Etain 's death make you chaste when her life could n't ? OWAIN I 've learned how to savor desire , perhaps ; or , perhaps , it 's loss I love most . VINCENT Have you thought how loss empties the soul so that faith might fill it ? Owain , I would build a church on this spot . OWAIN This is a burial mound . It is a sacred spot . Build your church somewhere else . VINCENT The people have worshipped here since time began . It would seem natural to them to add God to their pagan tribe . Slowly , they 'll learn the truth of the one true Lord . I want to build a church to Etain 's memory , consecrated to the blessed Virgin Mary . OWAIN Not on this spot . No . Not on my land . p. 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the memory remains of Etain 's body being heaved up from the earth , Brigit and that wild woman from the hills will hold sway over the people 's hearts . OWAIN I belong to the old ways . VINCENT Then why do n't you practice them ? OWAIN I practice as well as I can . VINCENT The new faith does n't intend to destroy the old . The old faith is floundering by itself . The new faith is vital and young , a faith of bold fathers and sons . People need to be forgiven , Owain , for what they 've done . The Church offers that : forgiveness from sin . Who among us does not need to know we are forgiven some terrible wrong ? Who among us does not need to forget and learn to believe in a merciful redeeming love ? Etain loved this land , in sight of the hills and the sea . She 'd be living now if a church had been built when she came as your bride . A church would have kept this land free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so yet . Owain , you might return to yourself . OWAIN I am closer to myself than I have ever been , though I lack the action to show it . VINCENT Build a church . Manifest what you 've become . OWAIN Enough ! I have heard you through . For the rest of the night , I want to hear music coming down from the hills . p. 66 Act 2 , Scene 2 : Scene 11 SCENE ELEVEN IAN and ELEN enter . They have come from the Beltane feast . IAN pulls ELEN by the hand . IAN Here , right here is the spot where I should have fought . I ought to have murdered that man , Lord though he be , when he sought my wife . All would be changed if I 'd done as I should  --  chopped off his head , ripped out his heart . I would be king of the Beltane feast , the women would flock around me . But . . . what good is remorse ? If I had it to do over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . If someone comes bothering you , you come to me ! I 'd knock the man down , trample him into the ground . ELEN Leave me alone . IAN What ? ELEN Leave me alone . IAN I thought we came here to . . . well . . . you asked me to come . It 's Beltane night , we ought to . . . it 's the right thing to do . It encourages growth of the crops and easy birth of the lambs . ELEN I am sick of the feast and my father 's songs . IAN Elen , I 'm not the man I once was . Do n't make me pay for the past . I was weak and pliable then , but I tell you , it 's true , it 's my own life I 'd give defending you . p. 67 ELEN Leave me alone . IAN How can I leave such beauty alone ? ELEN Get out of my sight or I 'll knock you down the mountainside , till you end up in the barn caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing away : All right , all right , I 'm off . I ca n't stand a rage , really , I ca n't . I 'm sorry , I thought . . . well , no harm was done . . . I 'll go back to my flocks and my dreams . I 'll leave you alone with your hate . IAN goes . VINCENT approaches ELEN ; he has overheard the exchange . VINCENT He 's right , for once . Here you are alone with your hate , and the pain on your face . ELEN What do you want ? VINCENT I was kneeling at Etain 's grave , thanking the Lord for the peace He has given her . I heard what was said . ELEN Better give peace to those still alive than to the dead . VINCENT That , too , He can do . What is it , Elen , puts you into such pain ? ELEN Did you love Etain ? Do you hate me because I ran with her man ? p. 68 VINCENT God will forgive what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elen , speak , unburden yourself . ELEN Go back to your prayers . VINCENT If you speak from your heart , understanding will come . That is God 's grace . ELEN There are things in this world from which even your god turns his head . VINCENT Elen , I have stood where you stand . My flesh has been pulled toward a spot my spirit disowned . I coveted another man 's wife . I have fallen asleep in boys ' arms . For years , I lived in hot longing and pain . Do you know what I am saying ? No act has been more forbidden than one act I once lived for . I was drawn by my need toward my God . Do you think the Lord God , my Father , whom I invoke on my knees does not forgive ? ELEN Hush . Do you hear that full voice singing songs up the hill ? That is my father . Do you hear ? I would go to him now , sit at his feet , let him run his hand through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he weaves till I woke and all that remained of his touch was my hate of the foul desire I had felt . Does your god shudder when he hears that ? VINCENT Do you think God would turn from your pain when He embraced me in mine ? Come , we will seek out our Lord . You will lose yourself in his love . He is the Father your soul desires . He will fill your heart with His love . p. 69 Act 2 , Scene 3 : Scene 12 SCENE TWELVE CONOR has sneaked up the hill to the Beltane rites and the Beltane fire . He meets ETAIN , MACHA 's daughter , on the edge of the festival grounds , gathering sticks to be burnt in the flames . Silhouetted behind them a large fire burns . CONOR Hello . ETAIN Hello . CONOR What are you doing ? ETAIN Gathering dead branches and roots to be burned in the Beltane flames . CONOR What for ? ETAIN The fire will free from bough and from branch the spirit death trapped in death 's shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we leap over the flames , we take the fire into our veins . Everything frozen and dead kindles the life of the spring . CONOR How odd . ETAIN Odd ? I thought everyone knew of Beltane . Where are you from ? CONOR I live in the big house below . And you ? ETAIN I live in the hills or in caves close to the sea . I live where I want to be . Come , do you want to leap over the fire ? p. 70 CONOR I ca n't go any closer . ETAIN Then leap over me . She rolls on the earth . I am your Beltane flame . I am the fire loose in your veins . CONOR jumps over her , then rolls on the ground . CONOR Leap over me . I am fire . I am flame . ETAIN leaps over him . ETAIN Ouch . You 're hot . CONOR I 'm next , I 'm next . ETAIN squats ; he leaps over her back . You burn , you burn . He turns and leaps back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETAIN rising and taking CONOR 's hands : You can sing this song as you leap : Bless me and all living things I love . All kine and crops , all flocks and grain , Bless the spirit that is inside each tree , each well , each rock . Bless each shape-change from fish to fowl to fox . Bless me and all living things I love . CONOR looking at her hard : What else do you do on Beltane ? ETAIN Whatever you wish . p. 71 CONOR What if you 're caught ? ETAIN Caught ? CONOR What if you do something wrong and someone older finds out ? ETAIN What could you do wrong on Beltane ? She begins to sing the Beltane blessing . The two children join hands and dance . Bless me and all living things I love , all kine and crops , all flocks and grain , nuts and seeds , day and night , from Hallow Eve to Beltane Eve , Bless me and all living things I love . ANGUS appears . He walks with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your house , against your father 's will , eh , Conor ? CONOR with a start : Angus , you would n't tell ? ANGUS We 'll see ; what will you do for me ? CONOR I 'll see my father raises your rents if you tell . I 'll not be threatened by you . ANGUS Go along home , boy . You do n't belong here . It 's the duty of your father 's folk not to keep secrets from him . p. 72 CONOR to ETAIN : Tell me your name . ETAIN Etain . CONOR That was my mother 's name . ANGUS Go along home . CONOR Etain , when can I see you again ? ETAIN Wherever you find me , there I 'll be . In cave or tree , wind or sea . ANGUS Go on , Conor , go . You 're over your head . Go back to your house and your bed . CONOR goes , but as he does he sings to ETAIN : Bless me and all living things I love . Etain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . . . ETAIN Why did you drive him away ? Everyone is welcome on Beltane Night . ANGUS He is not of our faith . ETAIN Nonsense . So what ? ANGUS The church would destroy Beltane Night . ETAIN Why would it want to do that ? ANGUS The church wants one god . ETAIN It should have whatever it wants . One more god would be fine . p. 73 ANGUS laughing : You are a wonderful child . You 're not like your mother . You 're soft like the other Etain . ETAIN Since we 've been camped in these hills I have felt called by a voice , a voice so lovely and sad I would go wherever it called and do whatever it bid . Do you think it could be Etain ? ANGUS She died the day you were born . Some say your mother cast the spell that killed her . ETAIN My mother 's never done harm . ANGUS I did some work for her once . I asked for some small thing in return . From that day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop lying , old man . ANGUS She crippled me for no cause . But , tonight , child , for the first time , I feel the old juices running again . I need you , Etain , to take off your mother 's spell . Come here , little girl , little swallow , little gull . ETAIN You 're scaring me . ANGUS You have beautiful breasts , like the buds of springtime themselves . Come , sit on my knee . Let me touch those little buds . ETAIN Stop . p. 74 ANGUS We wo n't tell your mother a thing . You 'll make me well but we wo n't tell her how . Etain , you 're beautiful , pure . You 're like my own child to me . ANGUS kisses her . ETAIN strikes him . MACHA and BRIGIT enter . The CROWS appear too , flapping angrily around ANGUS . MACHA Leave my daughter alone . ETAIN runs to MACHA . Get off this mountain . You soil Beltane . BRIGIT Once you used your own daughter while I shut my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get away from me . The CROWS cry out again . ANGUS Without me , the faith dies . MACHA The faith has no place for a man who does not know deception from love , who puts his needs before the needs of the young , who uses life for himself . BRIGIT rousing the CROWS , which go after ANGUS : Cast him out of the faith . Banish him from our sight . Let him go comfortless , evermore . The CROWS chase ANGUS off the mountainside . BRIGIT sinks down under her cloak ; she becomes part of the mountain , a rock. p. 75 ETAIN He 's a creepy , cruddy , curdly dog ; a mangy , mucky , squishy frog . Let 's put him in our brew and cook him up ! MACHA Let 's burn him out of our minds , banish him from our dreams . CONOR has stolen up the hill from the other side . CONOR Etain . . . ETAIN running to him : You should never have left me alone with that horrible old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACHA Who are you , lad ? CONOR Lord Conor , Lord Owain 's son . MACHA Etain 's child . CONOR My mother is dead . MACHA You carry her eyes and her pride . CONOR Who are you ? MACHA Macha , Etain 's mother , and your mother 's friend . I knew her before you were born . CONOR Oh . MACHA Why so sad ? CONOR It 's my fault she died . p. 76 MACHA Who tells you that ? CONOR I read it in everyone 's eyes . MACHA You are her child . She , too , read through to the heart with a gaze . ETAIN Oh , Conor , it 's not true . You did n't kill your mother . Come , Conor , catch me . I have so much to tell you . As the children run off , OWAIN appears . OWAIN Conor ! You will be punished for this . CONOR You can whip me tomorrow ! MACHA Stalking your son ? OWAIN Is that what you think ? MACHA That 's what I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your sweat on my tongue . MACHA Etain 's son is a fine lad . OWAIN Why are you here ? MACHA I left my dead on this land . I birthed on this shore . OWAIN Is that all ? MACHA I was called to the Beltane rite . OWAIN I have wanted you . p. 77 MACHA You 've come . OWAIN Yes . MACHA The conquered come back . OWAIN And those who are n't conquered yet . MACHA There is no one like that . OWAIN No one not conquered by you ? MACHA By whatever has knotted the heart . OWAIN It was done with your arms round my back . MACHA It was done long before I appeared . I am not your way out . OWAIN You are the future I want . MACHA We are driven by something else . OWAIN By desire itself . MACHA By all that we 've lost . OWAIN Twelve years you 've roamed . . . a woman alone . MACHA Cast out . Lied about . OWAIN Afraid to take what you 've won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come offering that ? OWAIN I offer you freedom from self . p. 78 MACHA Where will I be ? OWAIN Spirit to naked spirit with me . MACHA Faceless and lost . OWAIN Fleshless through flesh and found . MACHA What will I learn ? OWAIN How flame speaks to flame . How white light rises from the earth 's bowels . How music is made . MACHA Why must I know ? OWAIN Because we are one and the same slipped through the other 's flesh painless and safe into life . MACHA Those are wonderful words that you speak . I was last wooed by words in a shepherd 's hut . OWAIN I offer you the house of a king . MACHA He bade me fight for my life . OWAIN I offer you a king 's strength . MACHA Such strength means a fight in the yard , more fights if I follow you back . OWAIN I offer you a king 's love . MACHA No , Owain , it is not right . OWAIN When ? I will wait . p. 79 MACHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OWAIN Do n't play with me . I want you as my queen , now , in this life . Tonight . MACHA I am not meant for the part . Etain was well cast . OWAIN Etain is twelve years dead . MACHA Etain lives in my heart . OWAIN And in mine . But I can not live in the past . I can not live without love . And you , will you live cold and alone day and night ? MACHA I do not . OWAIN There is someone else ? MACHA There is all this , a world that I love , a child , and , above all else , I go in service to what is unlived , to all that we might become . It is a fierce , terrible love . OWAIN I can share that . MACHA Perhaps , in your time , in your way . MACHA turns and begins to leave ; the two stand apart as the children come running in . ETAIN This is how Macha did it . She wrestled him right to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop . Let 's be our mothers , the lambs  --  wild and free . I want to be like my mother was when she lived . ETAIN Catch me , if you can . I am my mother , the ewe . You are yours . They scamper about . CONOR O , I am heavy with lamb . Quick , Etain , rub my belly . ETAIN sings : Poor , fat ewe , you are big with the lamb you must birth . Throw back your head and laugh in the wind . Throw back your head because effort is love and death must lose in the end . CONOR Baaa ! Baaa ! Is that what my mother did ? ETAIN She did . CONOR Brother Vincent would call that sin . ETAIN What is sin ? CONOR Something that feels good . ETAIN Let me try . She lets out a long animal bray , like a scream of love . Baaa ! Baaa ! Rub my belly , Conor , rub my belly now . CONOR comes to rub her belly and they fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumble around , until , suddenly , they fall into a deep child 's sleep on the ground , their bodies curved in an S-shape , one against the other , their arms intertwined in a manner that seems to make the two into one . Silence . The Beltane fire burns . BRIGIT rises and covers the children with her cloak. p. 81 BRIGIT Here is one boy and one girl to bless as the Beltane night ends . She sinks down . The CROWS hover around her . MACHA to OWAIN : There is the next life of which I spoke . OWAIN They are children at play . What do they know of loss or of love ? MACHA Learn the deep reaches of your son . OWAIN I will learn whatever you wish ; come home with me . MACHA Beltane is over and done . I will be gone . OWAIN You are needed here . Come with me , as my queen . MACHA Go . Let me be . Go home with your son . OWAIN turning his disappointment into anger at his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You came here against my will and saw things I had forbidden to you . Get down the hill to your bed . Wipe the thought of this night from your eyes . There 's a colt to be broken at dawn , wild birds to be hunted and slain . I want you manly and brave in the morn . He takes CONOR roughly by the shoulder and pushes him down the hill. p. 82 MACHA Paah ! He knows nothing yet . BRIGIT rising and going toward MACHA : Perhaps not , but I have thought things out . I , too , waited twelve years , looking about , searching my heart . This year I called you to me . MACHA You have been with me since the sun set . Midwife , we have birthed this night , and will wash ourselves fresh in the dawn . Yet I do n't know why I was called to this spot . BRIGIT I am old . The autumn tree seeks full color and form . Had I knelt with you by the sea that night many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my longing might have been over and done . Had I shared your struggle and known your eyes wild with effort and love , my heart might have drunk its full from your writhing and cries . MACHA Yet you did none of those things and left me alone until Beltane . BRIGIT Tonight the past found its full shape and slipped far back in my heart . All of the past , that is , except one missed sea birth . Were I not old I might forget in the passions of years to come so simple a trust that never had been . But age can not silence the torturous scream for what is perfect and gone . Age is the ageless keen , keening the greed of love . p. 83 MACHA Why am I not afraid when you speak of greed ? BRIGIT I am offering self to you . MACHA You will leave your home ? BRIGIT I will teach you and Etain my herbs . My healing lore is my home ; I carry that where I go . MACHA You will bond your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since time began , much we have sought would have come . MACHA Let us bathe by the light of the dawn . They go to the spring which has bubbled up on the spot . They begin to bathe one another gently . BRIGIT The spring wells up once a year from the earth 's core . MACHA What tales does it tell ? BRIGIT Lost souls seeking return play on their pipes at the river 's source . They send their longing to us . ETAIN wakes. @x The same scene , a morning after Beltane . ETAIN is older now , perhaps sixteen . Time and no time at all has passed . The CROWS dance around ETAIN , waking her from her dream . CROWS Wake , Etain , wake . You are grown . You are no longer a child asleep on a hill , dreaming of things you could not know . Wake as a woman wakes smiling of night , desire awake in her heart . ETAIN Mother . . . where have you gone ? CROWS Gone off with Bright . ETAIN The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's heart cried . ETAIN Where have you gone ? CROWS Far from this place , locked in her arms . ETAIN Gone from me , gone ? CROWS Flown away , as if they were one . ETAIN Flown away , flown , the birds ' song sang . CROWS Gone from me , gone , the girl 's heart cried . ETAIN Gone , mother , gone ? p. 86 CROWS Gone . Gone . Gone from Etain . Gone away . ETAIN Gone with Brigit ? CROWS The girl 's heart cried . ETAIN Why , mother , why ? I am here . CROWS Why , mother , why , the girl 's heart cried . ETAIN To find what I never had , the mocking crows said . CROWS To find what I never had . The CROWS begin to change into their garments as peasant women , taking off crow-masks and wings , putting on their heavy , dull work clothes . ETAIN But I had a wonderful dream . CLEEVNA A dream , the girl said . ETAIN I dreamt of a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . MEENA The girl 's heart leapt . ETAIN I am grown . FIOLA Grown , mother , grown , the girl 's heart sang . ETAIN Grown and alone . I am free . DIEDRE I am free . The girl 's heart stopped . p. 87 CLEEVNA We must go , too . ETAIN Where , where must you go ? DIEDRE Down the hill to the house . CLEEVNA The house that sits by the shore . FIOLA We must spin the wool from the just-sheared sheep . ETAIN I will go , too . MEENA No . No . You must stay here on the hill . ETAIN No , I will go . I will help with your work . MEENA No , Etain , no . The work turns us ugly and old . DIEDRE The work makes us tired and dull . CLEEVNA The work is done for someone else . FIOLA You must stay far from the house . ETAIN I will disguise myself . She picks up a rag from the ground , one of the CROWS ' cloaks , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come help with your work . When it is through , I will run down to the sea . ALL No , Etain , no . ETAIN Look , look at that bird flying down to the shore , a heron , silver and free . Do n't you hear that bird calling to me ? She runs off. p. 88 DIEDRE After her , quick . She is gone . FIOLA She flees the life of the mountain tops . MEENA To run down to the sea where she was born . ALL To be born to desire again . MEENA After her , quick . ALL Women like us , bent and slow from our work , are helpless to keep her from what she must know . The peasant women follow after ETAIN . ANGUS , OWAIN and CONOR enter , in the midst of a heated conversation . ANGUS with his cane , limping still , but , like OWAIN , carrying bow and arrows . They are hunting . CONOR A coward ! Father . . . surely not ! Because I refuse to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge I make . CONOR I will not bring down a bird when I have no need of feather or food . OWAIN What is it you fear , lad  --  that I can shoot farther than you ? CONOR If it 's my strength you would test I 'll wrestle you in the yard in front of the house , with all of your people gathered to watch . p. 89 OWAIN The one who offers the challenge sets the task . Why do you cower from what I ask ? CONOR I have n't the heart to spoil this dawn with the hiss of an arrow and shriek of a creature in pain . I 'm barely awake from a wonderful dream . ANGUS Did you spend the night dreaming in bed or did you stray up the hills to dance ' round the Beltane flames till you woke too weakened to hunt ? CONOR That 's it , of course . The old song , sung at the Beltane feast . I heard it once as a boy , sung by a girl named Etain . But last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The song and a vision of free flying birds . I can not kill what I dreamed . ANGUS Pah . . . it 's four years since I wasted my time on that rite whose force and power are gone . OWAIN It 's an empty form . I feel the reason is gone . ANGUS Aye , it 's become a womanish thing : silly steps and shrill voices  --  womanly concerns . There 's no woman at all can conceive a ritual dance equal in force to a man 's . But I thought you preferred womanish things . . . OWAIN What do you mean ? ANGUS Well , Lord , look at your son lying there on the ground , ensnared by a womanish song . p. 90 OWAIN Get up , boy , get up . There 's no time to mope on the hunt . CONOR " Bless me and all living things I love , " I ca n't get those words out of my head . OWAIN Hush ! I 'll have a shot at that bird . They fall silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANGUS Wounded , but not brought down . Let me finish the task . ANGUS aims and shoots . We hear the twang of the bow , the arrow whistling through the air and the shriek of the creature in pain . We also hear CONOR crying out with the bird , as if he 's been wounded , too . Pierced her clear through . OWAIN Well done . It 's fallen there by the rocks . What 's wrong with you , son ? You bother me with your sounds . CONOR Father , call off the hunt . I seem to be one with those birds . ANGUS Ho . . . there 's a fine bird in full flight . He takes aim and shoots . Again , we hear the sounds of the bow and the arrow , and the shriek of the bird . Conor cries out with the bird . OWAIN Conor , be still . ANGUS A hit ! Lord , forgive me for firing first . T was a moment had to be seized . Is your son all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Conor , stand up . CONOR Father , stop the hunt . I am one with those birds . OWAIN Stop whining at me , boy . Act your age . ANGUS Do n't blame your son . It was you , after all , who forbade the rite that might make him a man . . . in which you , Lord , would slaughter the puck and take for yourself the strength in the puck goat 's blood . Had he been raised on that rite , he would n't be cowering now at the hunt . OWAIN Quiet , a shot . Again we hear the arrow and bow , but not the scream of the bird , and CONOR is still . ANGUS Too bad . Have you thought to bring the rite back ? There 's of course some who say such dances and play have no magic power at all , but I 'm not inclined to agree . Look at the way the flames of Beltane have sapped the strength of your son . Ah , there 's a beautiful bird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow sounds . A miss . . . oh , well . . . Its flight is a thing to behold . Glorious , bold . Of course , ritual acts have no power in and of themselves . . . yet an idea that 's given clear shape the people are likely to accept . Since you forbade the fight with the puck the people are left with the womanish ways of Beltane or the womanish ways of the monk . Quick Lord , a shot ! But OWAIN is lost in thought . Fled . My Lord , have you thought to revive that fight ? p. 92 OWAIN It has come to my mind . ANGUS Aye , those were glorious days . You ought to have seen us then , Conor , my lad . We were two glorious men . I shared with the king whatever I had . The rites I led and whatever I had in my bed . My daughter , eh , Lord , and the puck , both at the time you were needing new blood . CONOR You sicken me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , bow , arrow , and shriek . Again , CONOR cries out . ANGUS Wounded , but flown out of sight . What 's wrong with you , lad ? Those women up in the hills have sapped the strength of your son , my Lord , and your aim is not what it was . You 're not likely again to have one woman swelled full with child and another slim one in your bed . And he , Lord , well , your line seems to be done . It 's a womanly thing he 's become . You ought to have brought that rite back long ago . OWAIN Conor , pick up your bow . You will bring down the next bird that flies overhead . CONOR I will not destroy a beauty I 've loved . OWAIN You dishonor this land with your cowardly ways . You will bring down a bird or not think of yourself as my son . p. 93 CONOR I will wrestle you in the yard . But I will not kill what I 've loved . ANGUS It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you loved at your birth . Ripped your mother apart , so Brigit the midwife has said . Now she comes haunting you in the shape of a bird . Is n't it so ? It 's the ones we 've hurt most hold us most in their spell . Quick , pick up your bow . ANGUS and OWAIN take aim and shoot . Arrow and bow and bird scream . But CONOR is silent . ANGUS Two arrows right on the mark and that glorious free-flying creature is ours . And your son , Lord , is still . He did not cry out . Together , my Lord , we are strong . The king and the maker of masks . In confidence Look how we 've released the lad from the fiendish spell he 's been in . OWAIN Quick , lad , you 've time for a shot . Slay that bird coming now into view . Conor is still. slay her , I say , or you 'll lose the bed under my roof . Conor looks at his bow . Bring that bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll not call you my son . CONOR suddenly angered beyond control : Right , father , right , if you wish . I 'll slay that bird in the sky . Why not ! He shoots . We hear the bird 's cry . There 's a beauty I dreamed that is dead . And another one flown into view . Watch . He shoots again . We hear the shriek of the bird as it falls . My aim is better than yours . I can slay whatever I choose . He turns the drawn bow and arrow towards his father. p. 94 OWAIN Watch yourself , lad . CONOR It 's only a joke . He laughs . I 'm your son , after all , am I not ? We are three glorious men on the hunt . I 'll go claim the corpses I 've killed . Three hunters should share their spoils . There 's only one thing you have that I do n't . It 's a pity Etain is gone . She 's the one I should conquer and tame . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not brought down . Lord Conor can finish the task you each tried and failed . OWAIN moves to strike him across the face . CONOR steps back . CONOR It 's only a joke . I 'll go claim the corpses I killed for your praise . Exiting , CONOR nearly collides with IAN , who comes limping , holding an arrow in his hand . ANGUS The boy oversteps himself . OWAIN Silence ! I will revive that fight with the puck . IAN Look , I 've been struck . Oh , its quite all right . The arrow was spent ; I happened to be sitting under that bird , caught up in a glorious dream-like sight . OWAIN Where are you hurt , man ? IAN Here , in the thigh . . . it 's a scratch , that 's all that it is . . . well worth it , too , after the vision I had . p. 95 OWAIN What were you dreaming about that kept you from moving out of the way ? IAN Not dreaming , Lord , staring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my head , a beautiful goddess ensnared in their web . O ' t was a wondrous sight , reminded me fierce of a wondrous love I once knew . OWAIN You 're a fool , man , you always have been . You paid once for your bragging tongue . If I hear you giving voice to your silly visions and dreams , I 'll slice your tongue out of your mouth . Now , go back to your flock ! To ANGUS We will have the old ritual back . ANGUS As soon , Lord , as I have repaired the mask . The puck goat will die for the strength of the king , the wealth of the land , the yield of his line . p. 96 Act 3 , Scene 2 : Scene 14 SCENE FOURTEEN CONOR enters . He finds ELEN alone . His hands are dripping with blood . He is half mad after what he 's done . CONOR Look , Elen , look . For the love of my father and yours I baptized myself in their faith . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment thinking he has perhaps killed them : I will call Brother Vincent from prayer . CONOR I have no need of the monk . I am one with the men on the hunt . I beat them fair at their sport . Now I 'll have the spoils of their game . First , I 'll take you . When I 'm done , I 'll hunt out the girl named Etain . They 've aged you for me . You 're like strong liquor . When I 've drunk I 'll go taste the sweet-smelling girl . I 'll take her like I took those birds . I 'll come back with Etain trailing behind . But I work the tale in reverse . I 'll taste of you , first . ELEN Stay where you are . You have nothing to do with me . CONOR Wrong , Elen , wrong . I 've heard the tales that are told . How you pleasured my father while my mother died . How you pleasured my father and yours while two women they wed lay alone in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 97 ELEN He is still hunting me . CONOR Wrong . You are mine . I hunt in his stead . Old and weak as he is , he has given you over to me . See : he holds up his hands I stink with the blood of the kill . CONOR approaches her . ELEN holds her ground . She is strangely calm . Suddenly she feels pity for CONOR , for what he has been forced to become . ELEN Give me your hand . She lifts up his bloody hand and runs it down her cheek , painting her face with the blood . Now she lifts his other bloody hand and paints his face with it . We have mated here in the sun . I could not be more yours than I am . The rage we have felt marks us and makes us one . They stand still for a moment , as if suspended in time . The work of the carver 's hand is finally done . We two stuck in this pose . You craving a woman to hold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this place . Seek what you need . I have found comfort in my God . ANGUS and IAN enter . ANGUS Puffed up from the hunt as you were I thought you had gone to conquer a goddess or two . You 're wasting your time on that one . p. 98 IAN Aye , it 's a quest we all share , Conor , it 's true . A goddess who beckons to us , over the hill , out from the shore . Today the same dream has earned me a wound in the thigh and a threat on my life . ANGUS Sure . It 's queens and goddesses you 'll be seeking till you learn a woman 's a woman . Each one has something inhuman in her that batters the heart like a wave and leaves a man weak on the shore . You 'll be seeking to conquer that inhuman thing ; you 'll fail as each of us does . CONOR Shut your mouth , old man . ANGUS There 's no cause for anger at me . I never betrayed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go off on your quest , now , be gone . Go find the goddess who will forgive the lad who murdered his mother the day he was born . CONOR I should kill you for that . ANGUS Sure , if you could . You 're weak , lad . Just like that cold one there . He points to Elen . The ones whose mothers were killed by a hard birth never outlive that death . ELEN Conor , do n't listen to him . Come . I 'll walk with you as far as the path . ANGUS Come back when you have a tale to tell . Then we can talk man to man . p. 99 CONOR When I come back , you 'd better be gone . ELEN Come away from him . CONOR and ELEN exit . IAN Ah , I wish I was young again . Was n't it grand chasing dreams , and catching one long enough to feel the warmth of her flesh and raise the wrath of a king ? ANGUS Do you like the king 's threats ? IAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . I grow numb . Still , it is fun stirring him up . He 's a fine silly man , caught in his web just like us though we do n't own his land or share in his wealth . ANGUS Yet he shares in your dreams . IAN I suppose that 's usual enough . Poor folk can better imagine delight , having none , than the rich who have lost the power to dream . That 's why we 're around , I suppose , to care for the land and the herds and do the heart 's hard work . ANGUS And why are they here , do you think ? IAN Why that 's easy enough . . . They 're here to live off our work , they 're here to steal our dreams . They 're here to scare us with threats . They 're here to eat what we cook , kill what we raise , tease and misuse us , punish and abuse us . They 're here to destroy our land , trample us down , scorn us and hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune , then pay them the tribute they ask for , treating us as if we were fools . p. 100 ANGUS Quiet . That 's enough . While you were dreaming and being stuck , I made the king vow to revive the fight with the puck . IAN Well , you 'd better look for another goat , my friend . There 's no way I 'll stick my neck in that mask again . ANGUS You 'll play the puck but we 'll alter the plot one small bit . This time , the king will not live . I 've poisoned the sword you will use . You and I will inherit the land , and his crown . IAN Angus , you jest . I could do no such thing ! Stab a king ! ANGUS He did it to you , after all . If you can pay him in kind , Elen will be your queen . IAN Me , a king with a queen ! Angus , what luck . Do I dare ? I do not . Take your plot somewhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know how . It 's the plot I 've dreamed and redreamed many years . Me , a king with a queen ! Angus , you can be sure I 'll always be grateful to you . Have no fear . You 've won the ear of a king ! p. 101 Act 3 , Scene 3 : Scene 15 SCENE FIFTEEN The yard in front of OWAIN 's house . The women sit at their work of carding and spinning . ETAIN helps with the wool , but her eyes wander down to the shore where she sees a heron flying free by the sea . ETAIN Look at that beautiful bird , silver and blue and alive , sailing out over the wave till sky and sea seem to merge in the beat of the blue heron 's flight . She rises and runs like the bird . I wish I was that bird , stirring the wings of the heart out of its own delight . She runs like the bird , then suddenly stops , shrieks in pain as if wounded and falls in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay seated : He 's on his way up from the shore . CLEEVNA He 's brought down the bird . DIEDRE Aye , pierced it clear through . MEENA It lies in a heap on the broken side of a rock . FIOLA Hush , here he comes . OWAIN enters carrying bow and arrows . He sees ETAIN on the ground. p. 102 OWAIN half in jest : Who is this fallen asleep ? He approaches her . Get up , child , get up . Do you need food ? Are you too weak for this work ? Slowly ETAIN rises to a sitting position . She tosses her head . ETAIN You shot the bird from the sky . Did you not know it was me , it was you ? Do you not know what you do ? THE WOMEN Hush , Etain , hush . She is young . Lord , forgive her her tongue . OWAIN What is your name ? ETAIN Death , sorrow , grief . I am what 's left of the bird you brought down for sport . OWAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses . What is your name , girl , your name ? ETAIN I am Etain , spirit of what you destroyed , spirit of what you have lost . OWAIN silent for a moment : You have come hunting me with one 's sorrow filled voice and the other 's untamable eyes . ETAIN standing : You did n't kill it for food . You shot it because it flew ' twixt the sky and the sea till it seemed like a monster to you . p. 103 OWAIN It had caught the light of the sun and the deep shadows of the wave . It was one with the sky and the sea . It seemed untouchable by me . ETAIN drops her heavy cloak , revealing herself in the shimmering garment the women wear on the mountain . She rises slowly . ETAIN Why have you done this thing , breaking the world apart ? OWAIN We either break ourselves or something else ; that is the secret of life . Then we live with the death we have made or die from the death we denied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You stepped on a shell as you spoke . Once again you have trampled the world underfoot . When will you learn we are creatures of life ? Death is only the way we return . OWAIN Why do you mourn that bird or the cracked and brittle shell ? I have set their spirits free of their forms . ETAIN They were not yours to destroy . OWAIN What is mine , then  --  what ? This heart that has been shuttered for so long it has forgotten pain ? ETAIN It is no more yours than the bird . Only what you love is yours , only what quickens and rises up when you come . Alive , the bird was yours . Twisted and beautiful so was the shell . Alive they asked nothing of you , nor did they withold themselves . Broken and dead they scream in your ears for revenge , turning you deaf and hard , till you trample still more on the life you denied . p. 104 OWAIN Your words fall like a curse made on my kind in ages past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice but remain as I am . Your curse casts me into this form . ETAIN All things are changeable . OWAIN I do not feel so . ETAIN Look at my face . It will wither and age . It will crack like the bark of an old oak . My flesh will return to the earth . The nearer I come to death and decay from which the world takes its form the more I know of change . OWAIN Why have you come ? ETAIN I do n't know . I fear I dreamt you in a dream . OWAIN Fear , Etain ? Fear ? ETAIN I want to bury the bird you killed here by the sea so the salt and the sand can fold its flesh back in their warmth . Some of the feathers I 'll pluck from the corpse to wear in my hair . I 'll give them new life with my life . OWAIN You adorn yourself with something I killed in a moment 's envy and greed . Do you become that selfsame thing , begging for death again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sea . p. 105 OWAIN You can squat all day at the shore while the sun grows hot , then cold , and the corpse grows bloated and big . What will you know of death ? The miraculous stopping of breath , the moment flight fails , the wondrous fall , the flesh ripped apart on the rock , blood rushing out from the throat , wings lying broken and bent . You can mourn that corpse till it rots in the stink of the sun , in the foul moonlight . You know nothing at all of the instant life stopped . Have you ever stood silent and watched the beast that you hunted and sought fly from your sight while desire tears at your heart ? You would know what the hunter has felt . The minute the bird is conquered and falls , desire is done , longing ends . Death is peace to the hunter who hunts wild , untamable things . He takes her arm . Follow me up the hill to the cave beneath three polished stones where those who have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with the sound of the woman who once bore your name , who lies beneath those three stones . You have come taunting me with your pride . They exit . The peasant women take on a crow-like aspect again . CROWS She is caught , caught in his spell . Drawn to him like some broken thing . Quick , quick , up the hill . Macha must know her daughter is stolen away , carried by him under the earth , carried by him toward death . p. 106 Act 3 , Scene 4 : Scene 16 SCENE SIXTEEN Upon the hill . MACHA and BRIGIT . MACHA , already half crazed , paces , carrying torches , dressed in a long black robe , her hair loose , looking very tall and wild . BRIGIT attends her . MACHA I woke to a cry as if my flesh had been cut . Etain cried in grief . Etain has been taken from me . She is gone . Where can she be ? BRIGIT I , too , heard the sound in my heart . Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling rock would dare steal Etain from us . MACHA No , no , by human will she is gone . Little bird who once flew in my cave , little fish who once swam in my sea , why have you fled ? The CROWS appear . BRIGIT Hush , Macha , hush . The wild crows know the truth . BRIGIT approaches them . There is flapping of wings and whispering , cackling sounds . She is at the house . MACHA The house ? BRIGIT At the shore . MACHA Why ? Why is she there ? BRIGIT She is drawn by something unknown . p. 107 MACHA No . No . Everything full and mysterious dwells with us here in the hills . BRIGIT She is called by a touch . MACHA The sound of a voice . BRIGIT Owain , himself . MACHA Owain has captured Etain . Call her home . BRIGIT She is caught . MACHA No , she is not . BRIGIT She is under his spell . MACHA Call her back ! BRIGIT I can not . His voice is all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , my flesh . She could not run off . She is carried away by a man who has dreamed me his slave . BRIGIT She must go where he leads . MACHA He steals the treasure I made . He who has nothing to claim , claims my flesh as his own . He breaks Etain 's will , carries her far from her self . BRIGIT Macha , do not grieve so . She will come back when she can . The daughter returns in the end , comes back from a longing in her heart to be where love starts . p. 108 MACHA What do you know of such things ? Childless and old , what do you know of my loss ? BRIGIT I am yours to be used in your grief as you will ; that is all I know . MACHA Bring her back . BRIGIT I am helpless to counter his spell . MACHA She is the woman he killed reborn to be slaughtered again . She is the one who beat him once , beaten down , now , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She will meet death and laugh . MACHA She is a child in his grasp . He is stronger than she . BRIGIT In body , perhaps . MACHA She is taken by him . She is raped . I am conquered at last . Better the earth should perish and rot . Better the earth should tremble and die than Etain be stolen away . Better all life should end than a child I birthed be abused , a child I made be raped , be lost to herself . You may be helpless , crone , but I am not . Off and away foul-smelling birds , bear Macha 's anger down to the house . Gnaw out the heart of him who has stolen my love . Eat the seeds from the earth , kill the crops . Pick out the eyes of the new-born lambs . Hide the sun . Cause a quake in the earth until Etain is returned . I will turn the world upside down under his feet . Wipe out the crops , kill the sheep , blight the house and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be laid waste than this sorrow allowed . MACHA begins to pace , rending her garments , keening a wild keen . BRIGIT follows with the torchlights as the sky grows dark. p. 109 p. 110 Act 3 , Scene 5 : Scene 17 SCENE SEVENTEEN Darkness . OWAIN and ETAIN approach the dolmen . MACHA paces in grief on the mountain top . OWAIN Here is the place . Here , beneath these stones the path leads toward the center of the earth , the common grave . ETAIN The birds are circling round the sun . They keep the light away . My mother grieves at losing me . I would return to her . OWAIN Go , then , if you will . I leave you free . She does not move . Or follow me into this sacred cave and learn the secret she would keep from you . ETAIN The birds are circling round the sun . They will destroy the crops and blight the land you have forgot in this mad search for death . Let me go back to her . OWAIN What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you life will turn on you because you dare to touch the death in one whose name you bear ? ETAIN I am free to follow where I will . I am not bound by her , nor you . OWAIN Then come . Within this cave you will learn all that made me slay the wild bird . p. 111 ETAIN Death is not yours to tame . It is not man 's . You can not hunt death down . OWAIN What are you afraid of , what ? That if you follow where I lead you will find out why you plucked the feathers from a corpse to braid into your hair ? ETAIN The birds are circling round the sun . They will eat the crops and kill the lambs . The earth will take revenge if you forget death is ruled by life . I will return to her . OWAIN What are you afraid of , what ? In her anger that you 've gone she casts death upon the land ? In her rage she will reveal to you the thrill she feels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The CROWS pick up the black ground-cloth , making the earth quake as OWAIN leads ETAIN into the cave beneath the dolmen . Overhead , MACHA emits a cry . ETAIN The earth convulses as we enter here . Let me return . The quake will end . OWAIN We must go deeper down . ETAIN The earth heaves up again . OWAIN She threatens us , but we will learn all she forbids . We must go deeper down . ETAIN The sky is dark . The earth breaks herself apart . I must go back . p. 112 OWAIN Not before you understand the reason why the wild bird is slain . ETAIN Why do you drag me with you , why ? All is dark and fearsome here . OWAIN Yes , you must see her as she is . You must see why men must fight and must destroy . We must go deeper down . ETAIN Stop . The earth convulses underneath my feet . She heaves up dead , decaying things . The stink of rotting flesh confuses all that lives . OWAIN Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see . We are nothing but this dirt , this dust . Here , Etain , are bones . He kicks them with his feet . Etain 's bones lie underneath your feet . Touch . Smell . This is Etain : this stink , this rotted flesh . This is the life you love , for which you have been named . ETAIN You brought me to her grave . OWAIN Yes , I brought you here , to death , to death which eats us up , food for a vengeful appetite , and there is no escape . She takes the best of us before our time ; leaves the worst for last . But all end here , a stink of bone and rotted flesh . And no one equals death , unless we kill the wild bird . In the moment that the blade goes through the throat , in the scream the victim makes , the killer commands death . The hunter does not wait . He spares no one . He bests death at death 's game . He proves his strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have come for this . Let me touch what you have touched . Let me feel with my hands those bones you kicked . ETAIN takes up the bones . She caresses them . She holds them in her lap . She touches the earth with her hands . She paints her cheeks with dirt , the dirt made of ETAIN 's rotted flesh . Here are her bones , and here her flesh . Dear , dear Etain . It was not death , but fear that claimed you for her own . Yet what have I to fear if this is what you have become ? You are the earth from which I grow . I am Etain . One who loved you bore me from herself , dragged me from the flesh between her thighs , spat me out upon the ground . What wild cry escaped her lips when you turned stiff and died ? What endless keen still echoes on the wind ? Yet she was bound to life . Mimicking the earth that writhed beneath your corpse , what wild cry escaped her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mixed in the blood and filth that flowed from her , I hid . Amid her grunts and groans I called my name , Etain . Looking down she dared respond : dared name me for the dead , dared offer me her breast , dared love . Though as I sucked she knew my head would break upon the rock there at her feet ; the sea would take me back ; or she could leave me for the birds to peck apart . Each time I sucked she felt death 's claim on her . " Death is the mother who calls us back , " " Death is the lover we seek , " she thought and rocked me in her arms . " Life is the trembling babe who would willingly shatter and break if I flung her down on these rocks . " " Life is all we might lose , all that we might not keep . " " Life is what comes from grief . " Till the light flows into this cave , I will lie here cradling these bones . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , OWAIN paints his own face with the dirt and dust of ETAIN . Then he moves toward ETAIN 's lap . She takes him into her lap , and they sit ; she holds him in her lap . Rocked there , he weeps. p. 114 p. 115 Act 3 , Scene 6 : Scene 18 SCENE EIGHTEEN An eerie dark . IAN talks to the puck goat head . IAN It 's you and me , again , chum .

CONOR I 'll kill him for this . IAN Excuse me , Lord , I happen to know , Lord Owain will be back to fight the puck goat in an hour or so . Here , let me lend you this mask . It 's all right , really it is . Take my place . p. 118 CONOR What would I want with your mask ? I 'll go as I am . I 'll show him the man I 've become . I 'll take Etain back . She 's mine . BRIGIT Your talk no longer suits you to her . IAN Lord , go disguised . Catch him off guard . If you go as you are , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will see Owain is unfit to rule . Here , Lord , the mask and the sword . BRIGIT Give me the sword . She takes it and smells it . Poisoned . Angus did this . She spits on the sword and wipes it on her skirt . Poisoned the sword , just as he poisoned the faith . To IAN And you are part of the plot . IAN Poisoned ! My Lord ! I had no idea . No thought . He never told me that ! BRIGIT Silence . CONOR I 'll challenge him , yes . Fairly , I shall win the fight . There is no other way to set things right . BRIGIT Perhaps not . CONOR I 'll wound him , that 's all . Wound him in front of his folk . He 'll be disgraced . BRIGIT Perhaps . But you 'll be no better for that . p. 119 CONOR He 'll fear me , at last . I 'll have the woman I want . BRIGIT Etain is not part of your fight . CONOR She will decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is need for your father 's love driving you ? CONOR His love ! Give me the sword . Brigit , bless me now . BRIGIT Go well , lad . Be open to all you do n't know . Find all you must have . IAN to CONOR : Lord , be brutal and strong . Challenge the king . Bring him down ! IAN puts the mask on CONOR . You 're the fertile puck from the mountain tops , fearless and wild . Bellow and kick . You will conquer the king ! CONOR exits . Aye , it is a magical mask . But I had a narrow escape . I 'm happy to give up the crown , if I do n't have to risk my neck . Thanks , Brigit , thanks . I 've had enough of Angus and his plots . But I ca n't resist watching this show . I 'm off to see if Lord Owain eats dirt or kills his own child . Brigit , what a fine plot we have hatched . We 're smarter than Angus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIGIT Will you silence your tongue ! This plot was made long ago at the end of a fight Owain lost . And we must hope the curse Macha cast him in holds strong . p. 120 Act 3 , Scene 7 : Scene 19 SCENE NINETEEN Dark . Sounds of the CROWS ; ELEN and VINCENT talking in the yard . ELEN The birds have picked the fields clean . They terrorize the new-born lambs . The people fear some ancient spirit 's rage . VINCENT And you , my child ? ELEN I wonder why such destruction is allowed . What does it signify ? VINCENT What does it matter , child , if you have faith in God ? What does it matter if the world should end as we stand wondering why ? Our Lord redeems with everlasting life what nature scorns with scourges , plagues and death . ELEN The people fear starvation . They fear death . I can not help but share the sorrows of those who work this land . I understand why they would call upon my father to prepare a rite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went out of my father 's house , I knelt before him in the dust . With a single gesture I tore off my clothes . I wanted nothing of the pagan world from which I 'd come , nothing of his land , his wealth , nothing of the magic rites his superstition tied him to . In my hand I clutched one loaf of bread . But as I knelt there in the dust , a voice spoke in my ear . " Where is thy faith ? In grain ? " I dropped the bread upon the earth and stood . Naked I left my father 's house , clothed in my heavenly father 's love . This is what it means , my child , to renounce the old ways . You must cleave to nothing , no one , but your God . Where is your faith ? In a pagan rite ? p. 121 ELEN No . VINCENT Then give up these earthly ties . ETAIN and OWAIN enter . OWAIN Etain , never have I mourned my own wife 's loss until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lay in my arms and wept the whole night through . OWAIN Etain , I am full of longing for my son . If I wept for the losses of these years , I rose wanting to see the child who has grown from a babe to a man nurtured on nothing but the stone I had made of my heart . Vincent , have you seen my son ? ELEN Conor has fled . ETAIN He will come back . We are each of us pulled to that source . Each must find out what called us to life . Now the procession enters the yard . It is composed of ANGUS and the PEASANT WOMEN , the CHILDREN from Act II and , also , BRIGIT , here to watch over the scene but not to take part in it . The procession is full of need . It is an invocation and recalls the fear of the people way back when this tale began . PEOPLE singing : Each spirit of life bless our calling , each daimon who lives in each ridge , each spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for the sun to return . Bless the need that we have for the sun to return . p. 122 ANGUS Here , lord , is a magical sword . You will slay the puck goat ; then the land will revive , washed in the balm of that blood . OWAIN You 're certain that is the plot ? ANGUS Of course . OWAIN I read deception in your eyes . ANGUS You are nervous , my lord . Have I ever deceived you before ? OWAIN The sword you gave to the puck , is it free of all poison or taint ? ANGUS Lord , how can you ask such a thing ? OWAIN I have lost trust in you . He takes the sword . Where is the puck ? ANGUS In a moment , my lord , he will come . Till then , my lord , dance with the lady at your side , and I will dance with my daughter . Come , Elen , in the midst of this fearful dark , let us recall what is finished and done , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you not even look at me , girl ? ELEN My eyes are turned inward and all my desire has fled , upward , toward my God . ELEN drops down to her knees to pray with VINCENT . OWAIN and ETAIN join the head of the procession , which sings. p. 123 PEOPLE Each spirit of life bless our calling , each daimon who lives in each ridge . Turn the birds from the evil they do . Let the plague that we suffer be lifted . Bless the need that we have for the sun to return . Bless the need that we have for the sun to return . CONOR appears , disguised as the PUCK GOAT . The puck , the puck . Let Lord Owain slay the puck . CONOR approaches OWAIN and ETAIN . They separate from the procession . OWAIN What ! Puck goat , have you come again ! Image from another time . PUCK We will fight to return the sun to the land . OWAIN Yes , we will spill your blood on the earth . PUCK Or yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My business with this woman is my own . PUCK I will not let you sully her with age . OWAIN She is untouched and stays untouched with me . PUCK She 's mine . I 'll have her once I 've beaten you . OWAIN laughs : So . The prince has come  --  half goat , half man  --  to claim the maiden for his own . p. 124 PUCK Yes . Once I 've spilled your blood , I 'll pour life into her . OWAIN You speak too soon . ETAIN moving away : You will not barter me between yourselves . Those who survive are victors each and find me where they seek eternal things . She goes . OWAIN Go , catch her , goat , if you claim her as your own . PUCK Do n't call me by that name . OWAIN Why not ? You are the image of a puck , yet seem to lack ability to mount . Do you wear a mask to masquerade at all you can not do ? PUCK The king 's cloak you wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raise up your sword . I will conquer one whose rule brings a curse upon the land . OWAIN draws his sword and CONOR draws his . OWAIN I will strike first , if you do not ; my blood is hot . You 've thrown a challenge at me before my folk . Come , goat , do you fear this fight ? Slowly , they begin to circle one another . PUCK I hate the man who calls me by that name . I am not an image to be scorned . p. 125 OWAIN You are a mocking shape I would destroy . CONOR And you an empty shell called king . OWAIN You seek my power from me . PUCK What belongs to me , I claim . OWAIN You can not have my strength . PUCK Your strength will die with you . OWAIN Goat . You are not fit to rule . PUCK As fit as one who taunts with cruelty . OWAIN The power of a king rises upward , from the earth . PUCK It does . I will receive it from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blood . PUCK My blood will not empower you . The goat will slay the king . OWAIN You have been bewitched to do this deed by one who seeks my death . PUCK I stand here on my own . It is our fight . No one has interfered . OWAIN Then , remove your mask . Or is that ugly face your own ? PUCK You will see me as I am , and you will still be blind . CONOR removes the mask , handing it to ANGUS , who is shocked. p. 126 OWAIN Conor , my son . Put down your sword . There will be no blood . CONOR No . Who better for me to destroy than you who never looked upon my face with any but a cold , hardend look . OWAIN All that I did not have to give reproached me from your eyes . I was compelled to turn away . CONOR And I compelled to trail you like a dog , searching your angry ways for who I was . OWAIN I was alone . CONOR I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had been given me . OWAIN I saw my faults manifest in you ; I saw nothing else . CONOR I need not have removed the mask . I am still the wild puck goat . We challenged one another from the start . OWAIN It is a challenge I have just begun to meet . CONOR Too late . We will have this fight . OWAIN No , the fight is at an end . Put down your sword , my son . OWAIN lowers his sword , but keeps it in his hand . CONOR You ca n't disarm me with a softened word . p. 127 OWAIN You are my child , I will speak gentleness to you . CONOR Too late . Beneath this sword you will grow childlike . He lunges at his father . OWAIN steps away and is wounded , perhaps in the thigh . ANGUS A king who lets another strike the opening blow can not rule the land . The crops would die beneath a coward king . OWAIN The king is less a coward than he 's ever been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The carver 's next . ANGUS A son who turns against his father for no cause can not rule the land . OWAIN Wrong . His is the only cause to whose wisdom I submit . OWAIN throws down his sword . ANGUS reaches for it . OWAIN steps on it . Go . We will be left alone . VINCENT Denounce that pagan criminal who reaches for your sword . OWAIN What he does denounces him . The next turn on the lethal wheel of time , Vincent , is yours . VINCENT I will build a church upon this land . OWAIN You will . I lend my strength to something still unlived. p. 128 CONOR Yes , kill me if you can . OWAIN I would kill your rage . Then , the man you are can live . ANGUS to CONOR : Beat him while you can . He 's always hated you . OWAIN No , son . I loved you with a love that had no form . ANGUS Are you too weak to do the job ? He reaches for CONOR 's sword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Your plot is finished , done . OWAIN My son is the strongest man I 've ever known . He has fought his whole life through to make me see him as he is . Vincent , look , I follow your example in all ways . I , too , abandon all that I have been . I give up the robe , the vest , the sword , these jewelled weights , the boots that trod the land where others worked , this cloth , woven by another 's hand . I kneel naked in the dust before my son . My son , who rouses feelings I have feared far more than I have feared the battle I disown . Go , leave us alone . The PEOPLE exit . Can I disarm you , now , my child ? OWAIN reaches up and pulls CONOR down to him . CONOR sits , and rocked in his father 's arms , he covers both their bodies with his cloak. p. 129 OWAIN Until I took you in my arms I thought there was not comfort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed desire into death , until I rocked you back and forth . CONOR Father , I dreamed this touch and thought it was my mother who I sought . I felt I would remain a bent and broken thing , seeking after what is dead . The two rock slowly back and forth . They come into direct relationship with one another . They grow intimate , as the arc of their movement rises from effort into joy . Their motion is sensual , erotic , life-renewing . At its peak , CONOR speaks . CONOR Father , you have brought me whole into the world . OWAIN Now , at last , I know your body as my own . Flesh of my flesh , my son . We hear the sound of the CROWS . CONOR There , upon the hills , I see three shadows in the evening light . Two run towards each other and embrace . The other , bent and slow , stands quiet and apart . Do you see the shadows I describe ? Did you feel the wind blow as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw close ? OWAIN Yes , I see them there . Brigit , Macha and Etain  --  three who worked the mystery of birth and caught us in the spell they 've woven for all time . p. 130 CONOR Come , father , let us go . We , too , were made to live free on the hills , borrowing from nature what we need . Let us begin our climb . They rise and as they go , we see the women running towards each other , and the CROWS joining them . ETAIN Mother ! Mother ! CROWS She is home . ETAIN Mother , I 'm back ! MACHA Precious child ! CROWS She is grown . MACHA Grown , the wild crows sang . CROWS Grown ! Macha saw . It was true . ETAIN I am strong . CROWS Strong , Macha 's heart sang . MACHA You are beautiful , bold . CROWS Etain 's eyes shone . MACHA A woman full grown . ETAIN Yes , mother , yes . CROWS Macha smiled . MACHA A woman full grown , in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 131 CROWS I am proud , Macha 's look said . MACHA You are wise . CROWS As wise as Macha , perhaps , the girl 's heart jumped . ETAIN Brigit , I 'm back . BRIGIT So I see . The child comes back in the end . Comes back from a longing in her heart to be where love starts . ETAIN Mother , sing me a song . I have been far away . Welcome me back . I am grown . MACHA I will sing you a song from another time . She sings and the CROWS join her . There is no love like the love that I bear for Etain . I bore her out of myself . All that I am , she is . I am the sea , Etain the wave . I am the ground , she is the hill ; I am the sky , she is the sun , the moon . All that has form she is . I am all that is formless , senseless , wild , all that is feared or desired . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is the mark of my strength . She is the proof of my love . CONOR and OWAIN appear . They are welcomed by a gesture or a look . Silence . The sun sets .
