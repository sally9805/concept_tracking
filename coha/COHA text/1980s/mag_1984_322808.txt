Guatemalan exiles stir tension <P> Mexico , the source of an annual flow of about 3 million people to the U.S. , faces its own " silent invasion " of illegal immigrants . Over the past four years , 100,000 Guatemalans have fled their country to settle in the south Mexican state of Chiapas . The influx has caused serious tensions with Guatemala , brutally reminding Mexico that it can not remain immune to the violence and instability that pervade Central America . To alleviate the problem , the Mexican government last week began to move 4,500 refugees from camps in the border area to federal lands in Campeche , some 120 miles to the north . <P> The influx began in 1980 , when the Guatemalan government of President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia intensified its campaign to wipe out leftist guerrillas based in the mountains of Huehuetenango and Quiche . In the process , the army indiscriminately killed thousands of Chuj , Kanjobal and Mam Indians , whom they suspected of supporting the insurgents . Many of those who survived sought sanctuary across the border in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps . But , according to Roman Catholic Church authorities , an additional 50,000 Guatemalans are roaming the south Mexican countryside in search of work or hiding out in cities to avoid being caught by the migra ( immigration authorities ) . <P> The Guatemalan government considers the refugee camps , which are several miles from the border , to be staging areas for the guerrillas , a charge that Mexico indignantly denies . Dozens of times over the past four years Guatemalan troops have crossed the border to kill and kidnap refugees . The most recent attack occurred last month , when some 200 Guatemalan soldiers attacked a camp at El Chupadero , four miles north of the border . According to the examining doctor , four men , a pregnant woman and a six-year-old child were tortured and killed . <P> To lure the Indians back home , the Guatemalan government has announced plans to build a series of " model villages " that will provide housing , schools and health clinics . " We offer clear guarantees to those who desire to return , " President Oscar Humberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , Chacaj , last March . But no more than 300 refugees have accepted the offer . Most remain skeptical of the regime 's intentions : they note that returning families must register with the army and answer questions about why they left and where they went . <P> The Mexicans have only grudgingly accepted the refugees into Chiapas , one of the country 's poorest regions . The government has allowed them to stay because mass deportations would harm Mexico 's reputation as a haven for exiles . <P> Many of the Indians who fled to Mexico do not speak Spanish . Conditions in the camps are such that they continually suffer from malnutrition , tuberculosis and gastrointestinal disease . Mexican officials have been known to beat , rape or otherwise abuse the refugees ; often the officials extort bribes in exchange for a promise not to send refugees back across the border . Landowners pay Guatemalans $1 a day for their labor , vs. a Mexican minimum daily wage of $3.80.                  @ @ @
