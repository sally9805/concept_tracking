Skating out of the smog , palm trees and stifled yawns of Southern California , the Los Angeles Kings over the years have been prime examples of the harmful effects of beachfront living : all style and no substance . Sure , the Kings put a lot of goals on the scoreboard , but they maintained a freeway defense that led to late-season collapses and early exits from the Stanley Cup playoffs. // Now , however , the Kings have cast off the Future Is Yesterday program of their previous ownership and launched a three-year plan that started last July with a restructuring of their operation from top to bottom . The early results : for the first time L.A. has talent that is not only young , but productive and eager , too , and the Kings have the third-best record in the NHL . This heady turnabout has caused the club 's neophyte owner , the flamboyant Dr. Jerry Buss , to stick a Kings bumper sticker on his baby blue Lincoln Continental limousine and to warn fans they should start thinking about making Stanley Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a problem in L.A. , which in 14 years has taken to the Kings with what might be termed bridled enthusiasm . Trouble was , the cold-front refugees among the local population were n't eager to support a loser . Says Gordon Franks of Santa Monica , a transplanted Canadian and a Kings season ticket-holder , " If you want to talk hockey here , you better be prepared to call long distance . " // Buss ' three-year plan was running well ahead of schedule even before the Kings ran off a 10-1-1 record in their first dozen games this season . After taking a crash course in hockey by studying game films with Los Angeles Coach Bob Berry , Buss , who bought the Kings along with the Lakers , The Forum and miscellaneous other properties from Jack Kent Cooke in May of 1979 , went to work . He began to stockpile draft choices  --  not give them away , as the Kings had done over the years ; he traded for veteran defensemen  --  Dave Lewis and Jerry Korab in particular  --  to stop the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed scoring champion Marcel Dionne to the biggest contract in NHL history  --  a six-year , $3.6-million deal ; he remedied the Kings ' lack of depth by acquiring the services of veteran Center Garry Unger ; he gave Berry a bevy of rinkside assistants ; he organized a farm club in Houston ; and he redesigned L.A. 's uniforms . // The most significant change , though , was eliminating the Kings ' graybeard image . Last season the Kings added rookies Dean Hopkins , Mark Hardy and Jay Wells , a player brash enough to date one of Buss ' daughters ; his teammates now call him " Dr. Wells . " Last summer L.A. signed two first-round draft choices , Forward Jim Fox and Defenseman Larry Murphy , and a second-round selection , Forward Greg Terrion , and all play regularly . In the 12 seasons before Buss owned the Kings , they had only one first-round pick , having traded the other 11. // While dealing himself a new hand , Buss was careful not to throw away his aces . The Kings ' Triple Crown line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in league scoring before Taylor suffered a shoulder injury two weeks ago ; he will return this week . // Taylor 's absence has again served to discredit the theory that the Triple Crown line should be dismantled to change the Kings from a one-trick pony . Last season when Simmer went out with a knee injury , the Kings had only two wins and a tie in their next 17 games and fans sang " Goodby Berry . " This year after Taylor 's injury , L.A. lost four of five . " The sum of them together is greater than three hockey players , " says Berry . // Simmer leads the NHL scoring race with 18 goals and 18 assists for 36 points . That 's some accomplishment for a man who three years ago was without a team , after being released by the now-defunct Cleveland Barons . " It was sort of fend for yourself . " recalls Simmer . " I decided I 'd go with anyone who wanted me . " L.A. called . Simmer went  --  that is , to the Kings ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year and a half before finally joining L.A. in January of 1979 . He scored at least one point in each of his first nine games as a King and put away his travel guide forever . Now Simmer lives in Manhattan Beach , a single man 's idea of heaven , drives a reconditioned 1965 Corvette , roller-skates and plays volleyball , racquetball and golf . He seems to have adapted pretty well . Asked about his hometown of Terrace Bay , Ontario , Simmer says , " There 's five feet of snow there now . " // Simmer is 6 ' 3 " and 200 pounds , and his style is to park himself in front of the net like an oversized bulldog ; his chin is scarred from the sticks of players who have tried to move him out . Earlier this season he scored four goals in a game against the Islanders , and last season he set a modern NHL record by scoring at least one goal in 13 straight games . // Buss , a marketing whiz who likes to play Monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , an incentive plan designed to get all the Kings to pull together . If the team amasses 88 points in the standings  --  a total they have exceeded only once in their 13 seasons  --  the players will be rewarded with an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii , presumably sometime after the Stanley Cup finals . Also , for every shutout , each player gets a $200 gift certificate , while limiting the opposition to one goal is worth $100 apiece . So far the Kings have had one shutout and two one-goal games . " It 's like finding money , " says Berry . // One King who relishes the new attitude is the 29-year-old Dionne , who is often applauded for his personal successes but has never been highly regarded as a team player , perhaps because his club has usually been a laggard. // Dionne was heading into his option year and briefly considered jumping to another team , but Buss convinced him to stay , as much with a guarantee that he would produce a winner as with the rich new contract . Of Buss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he cares so much . It hurts to lose , knowing how much he hates it . At times I wish I could have about four arms and four legs . " // In the past Dionne used to keep a schedule alongside his locker , and as each game was played he would mark off the date as a man in prison might . Now the schedule is gone . Last Wednesday after Montreal came into The Forum and beat L.A. 8-4 , Dionne was snappish in the locker room even though he 'd scored a hat trick . He groused about mistakes and generally was a none-too-subtle thorn in his teammates ' sides . // The next day Berry put the Kings through a rigorous two-hour workout . " Punishment , " Dionne called it . Five minutes before the trial by ice ended , Berry sent Dionne and a few others into the locker room early . The message was clear to those left behind . // When the rest of the team , tired , angry and a bit rebellious , went to the locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was fun . " Said another , addressing those who got off early , " Way to go , prima donnas. " // On a TV set a video tape played and replayed Montreal 's eight goals from the previous night . Mario Lessard , the goalkeeper who had given up the goals to the Canadiens , sat there somberly , his face chalk white . // " Do we have to look at this ? " asked Hardy . // " Look at it , you might learn something , " said Dionne. // " We ca n't all score hat tricks , " Hardy muttered . // " Take a look at it , " Dionne said , his arms spread in a gesture of despair . // " You do your job and I 'll do mine , " snapped Hardy . // Across the room , another King said in a mocking voice , " Is this the start of dissension on the Kings ? " // Although the Kings lost to St. Louis 5-3 on Saturday night , Buss was not discouraged , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't hurt . " It 's a long road , " Buss said . " We 're talking millions of dollars , not thousands . We 're shooting to be up 30% in revenues each of the next three years . Then we 'll be able to compete . Until then I 'll just have to subsidize it . " // Buss pointed out that the Canadiens probably outgrossed the Kings by $3.5 million in each of the last seven years . " You give me $25 million more than them and we 'll beat Montreal , " he said . Buss also said he thought it was a good sign that the players were pointing fingers in the dressing room . " They realize that with me it 's , like , win . " // It is also , like , no longer a country club . The ocean and sun and palm trees are all still there , but the Kings are a different team . They figure that when it comes to stretching out on the beach they 'd rather it be in Hawaii .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
