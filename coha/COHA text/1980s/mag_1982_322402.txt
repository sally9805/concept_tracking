The switchboard breaks down , and rumors fly <P> The Moscow Olympic Games produced an unexpected benefit for human rights activists : international direct-dial telephone lines that vastly increased the flow of unauthorized information in and out of the Soviet Union . Installed for the benefit of the thousands of journalists , athletes and spectators who flocked to Moscow in July 1980 , the sophisticated French-built electronic switchboard enabled Soviet citizens to keep in closer touch with friends and family members in Western Europe and the U.S. <P> No longer . After reducing the number of direct-dial lines available for outgoing calls and then eliminating them , the Kremlin has now made it impossible for anyone to call from outside the country without going through an operator . The move has produced delays of 24 hours or more , and made it much easier for the authorities to monitor all communications . <P> To complicate matters further , virtually all Soviet international telephone communications went out of service at week 's end . The apparent reason , according to experts at American Telephone and Telegraph Co. , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although all telex lines and a few phone links continued to function sporadically , most Muscovites trying to reach an international operator were told brusquely to " please call later . " Communications eventually were restored , but in rumor-rife Moscow , the event was unusual enough to prompt immediate speculation that a change of leadership , possibly involving ailing President Leonid Brezhnev , was in the works , even though there was scant evidence to support that conclusion . <P> The Soviet telephone system is definitely overloaded and in need of extensive repairs . Since the Soviets own far fewer computerized switching machines than do most Western telephone systems , they have virtually no back-up equipment when a breakdown occurs . The Soviets claim that their modern direct-dial equipment has been transferred only temporarily from international service , where telephone usage is relatively light , to the domestic network . Said an official of the Ministry of Communications last week : " We will increase the number of lines and reintroduce direct dialing within two years or so . " <P> While agreeing that the internal Soviet telephone system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They see the elimination of direct international dialing as part of a general Soviet crackdown on communications with the outside world . Last month the Kremlin expelled Newsweek Bureau Chief Andrew Nagorski , accusing him of unethical journalistic practices . The Soviets arrested several members of an unauthorized " peace group " that was founded in June to press for better relations with the U.S. And last week Yelena Bonner , the wife of dissident Physicist Andrei Sakharov , announced that " cruel persecution " had finally destroyed the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group , an organization set up to monitor the Soviet Union 's compliance with the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act signed by 35 nations in 1975.
