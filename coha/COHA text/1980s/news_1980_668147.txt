ST . PETERSBURG , Fla. - It was a week in which President Jimmy Carter searched for the proper method to attack Ronald Reagan - to walk , as one of the President ' s aides said , " the fine line between being tough and being mean " - and it ended with Carter still on the offensive . As he campaigned in Florida yesterday , Carter called some of Reagan ' s proposals " ridiculous " and said it would be " a bad thing for the country " if the Republican were elected . The White House staff issued three pages of old Reagan quotations dealing with Medicare , Social Security and Cuban refugees - issues that are important in this retirement land - while Carter warned that Reagan had " right-wing " views about Medicare and held a position that would " bring Social Security to its knees . " It seemed obvious that , for all the attention attracted by Carter ' s admission Wednesday that he needed to get his campaign back on a positive track , the President has settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jody Powell , the White House press secretary , is that " we will try to conduct the discussion in a way that does not detract from the substantive nature . " The week actually started on a substantive note . Carter planned to use an appearance in a Milwaukee suburb Monday as an occasion to criticize Reagan on a complicated issue involving tax support for education and welfare programs . A " fact sheet " detailing Reagan ' s proposal to transfer " tax sources " for these programs from the federal government to the states was passed out by the White House staff with an advance text of Carter ' s remarks . " This is the first of a series of things to raise serious , substantive differences with Reagan , " said David Rubenstein , one of Carter ' s top domestic advisers . " The President has been unfairly criticized for raising racism and warmongering issues . So we ' re going to raise other points . " But on the flight from Washington to Wisconsin , a California reporter familiar with Reagan ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a hurried cockpit conversation between Rubenstein , who was traveling on the press plane , and Carter aides on Air Force One , the President amended his remarks and softened his language when he finally spoke . Powell blamed the confusion on Reagan . " We ' re trying to get him to say where the hell he stands on the issue . " Yet by that afternoon , it was apparent to the Carter team that the issue was not playing the way they wanted , that it was too complicated to be handled to their advantage on a short television news spot . " We ' ve got to get the lead changed , " one Carter aide said . So , before the day was done , the President was accusing Reagan of " jingoistic . . . macho " views on foreign policy . That night in Chicago , he declared that Reagan would divide the country " black from white , Jew from Christian , North from South , rural from urban . " The words were so strong that they appalled some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staunchest backers in Chicago . Afterward , one prominent Chicago Democrat said privately , " All he did was hurt himself here . " Carter ' s tendency to snipe at his political opponents has been a source of division within his campaign . One group of his advisers favors the tactic , butPowell - the President ' s alter ego - is reported to be increasingly troubled over the public perception that Carter is " mean . " At midweek , Carter ' s campaign chairman , Robert Strauss , went public with his opinion that the President ' s rhetoric was backfiring , and that same day Carter said in an ABC interview that he and Reagan shared the blame for the low tone of the campaign . He promised to do better . But in the midst of a close campaign , Carter apparently can not holdhimself back from roughing up an opponent . His compulsion was evident in his second appearance of the day Thursday in Nashville when he assailed Reagan on a variety of issues . He accused Reagan of making " false " statements about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms control . By nightfall , the President addressed an audience of 1500 Democrats in Tallahassee who had been feasting on fish and beer for hours before he appeared . With smoke curling to the ceiling of Agriculture Building No. 2 at the North Florida Fairgrounds , like the setting for the painting , " Stag Night at Sharkey ' s , " Carter stood in his store-bought plain blue suit , his legs set two feet apart in a fighter ' s stance . His right leg twitched intermittently , and he spoke with only a few notes . Reagan , he said , was guilty of " false statements . " " When these false statements are made that the United States is somehow militarily weak and vulnerable , it might lead a potential adversary to misjudge us and to challenge us in a way that would be suicidal , based on a distorted picture of what our nation is . " Yesterday , speaking before a far different audience , a gathering of elderly people in an aging stucco hotel in St. Petersburg , Carter told the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader against Medicare . " As he spoke , the White House staff supplied the Reagan quotes to back up the President ' s charges . With less than four weeks left in the struggle to save his presidency , it was as if they hoped the documentation would show that Carter was merely being tough , not mean .
