Conservationists debate how to save the great beasts <P> Before the white man came , the Indians venerated them as gods . Weighing as much 1,000 Ibs. and rearing up to 8 ft. on their hind legs , the great humpbacked beasts-among the largest carnivores in North America-can kill an elk or crumple the fender of a car with a swipe of a powerful paw . Still , for all its might , the grizzly , or more properly Ursus arctos horribilis ( terrible northern bear ) , has become pathetically vulnerable . <P> In the early 1800s , when Lewis and Clark made their famous survey ( and hesitated to send off scouts by themselves for fear they might accidentally disturb a bear ) , at least 50,000 grizzlies ranged from Texas to Oregon . Today , as a result of hunting , poaching and encroachment on their habitat , no more than 1,000 grizzlies , if that many , survive in the lower 48 states . One of the largest groups , probably no more than 200 bears , form an isolated , highly threatened band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the subject of a surprisingly ferocious argument among the very people who want to save them . <P> The long and complex battle traces back to the new environmental mood of the 1960s , when the National Park Service decreed that its holdings be kept as natural as possible and the animals be left to fend for themselves . Old dump sites , where the bears had long fed , were abruptly closed . Hotelkeepers were no longer allowed to put food out to attract bears for the amusement of guests . Well meant as it was , however , the new policy had unintended consequences . The bears began looking for food not only in campgrounds but outside the parks as well . They picked off sheep on nearby grazing land , prowled through mining and energy-exploration camps , and made scary appearances at new vacation homes on the outskirts of Yellowstone . <P> Inevitably , maulings and even deaths occurred immediately after the closures , as the bears , which are usually eager to avoid humans , increasingly encountered them . Yet more often than not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Lance Olsen , president of the Montana-based Great Bear Foundation : " The grizzly can get shot just for showing up . " Many of the animals are falling to poachers , who seem to have no trouble illicitly selling grizzly skins for as much as $10,000 or grizzly paws for $3,000 a pair . Even when they are caught , the poachers usually get off by pleading they killed in self-defense . <P> To reduce the risk of aggressive , foraging bears running into trouble , the rangers regularly trap and tranquilize strays and carry them by helicopter to remote areas of the park . But some of the grizzlies , regarded by rangers as unusually intelligent animals , persist in heading back to their new feeding grounds and eventually must be shot .
