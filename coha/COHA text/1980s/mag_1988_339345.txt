THE GREAT DIVIDE <P> by Studs Terkel <P> Pantheon ; 439 pages ; $18.95 <P> Others interview , Studs Terkel elicits . Under the influence of his discerning eye and disarming tongue , truck drivers and professors , black activists and Klan members , entertainers and executives yield their secret griefs and their private truths . It is appropriate that in his film debut  --  in John Sayles ' Eight Men Out  --  Terkel plays one of the first journalists to scent the World Series fix of 1919 . <P> In five books and a Chicago-based radio talk show , the oral historian defines the American experience with collages of interviews . By now Terkel , 76 , can be justly charged with employing a formula . Still , it is his formula , sedulously aped but never accurately reproduced . This latest compilation , subtitled Second Thoughts on the American Dream , finds an absence of consensus . " Things can go either way , " Terkel observes .

" Jean Gump , a quiet Roman Catholic grandmother , protests the presence of an Army missile site in Missouri and pays for her convictions by becoming No. 03789-045 in a West Virginia prison . <P> A Department of Agriculture executive in Minnesota offers a chilling report of two small farm children who eventually refused to board their school bus : " One afternoon , they came home on the bus and they saw the machinery being hauled away . On another afternoon , they saw the livestock hauled away . The kids said , if they rode that bus again , they 'd be hauling mom and dad away . " <P> Not everyone speaks of failed visions .

" <P> Although Terkel maintains an air of bemused objectivity during these exchanges , there is no mystery about the location of his sympathies . The book 's title is taken from the plaint of a black journalist : " If you do n't have any hope and all you look forward to is producing more and more generations of welfare kids , you 're definitely worse off . That is the big gap , the Great Divide . " <P> Can it be bridged ? At times Terkel is overtaken by despair : " What had presumably been our God-anointed patch of green appears to be , for millions of us , a frozen tundra .
