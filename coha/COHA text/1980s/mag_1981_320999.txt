The Daily News cuts back to stay alive <P> The grim dispatches have come one after another , like casualty reports from the front lines . First the Washington Star announced it was closing . A few days later , the Philadelphia Bulletin gave its unions until this week to accept $5 million in contract concessions ; otherwise it , too , would shut down . Now the New York Daily News has announced that its year-old afternoon paper , Tonight , will stop publication on Aug. 28 . Thus was written the latest chapter in a two-decade-old story of failure in the afternoon , this time with the loss of 320 jobs on the nation 's largest metropolitan newspaper . But the significance of the Daily News decision went beyond its ill-fated evening edition . In explaining Tonight 's demise , News officials also acknowledged that the once invincible morning paper was in serious trouble . <P> Long the bible of New York 's ethnic and blue-collar communities , the News started to slip as its traditional audience moved to the suburbs . Circulation dropped from 1.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanch the flow , the News and the parent Chicago Tribune Co. decided to seek a new readership among New York commuters and affluent Manhattan residents . They launched Tonight as a sophisticated answer to Rupert Murdoch 's sensation-mongering New York Post , which had the afternoon market all to itself . Clay Felker , who had founded New York magazine , was brought in as editor , and scores of new writers , editors and graphics artists were recruited . <P> With plenty of bravado but little foresight , the News tried to navigate the shoals that had caused evening papers elsewhere to founder : distribution delays in city traffic snarls and competition from suburban newspapers and local television news . Those hurdles proved insurmountable . Tonight received a huge injection from a $20 million News revitalization fund , but its circulation , headily projected at 300,000 , finally slumped to 70,000 . The News 's profits gave way to a torrent of red ink : even with Tonight folded , the paper expects to lose $11 million this year . Said Publisher Robert Hunt : " We went all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could and , damn it , it did n't work . It was a bad marketing plan . We made a mistake and we 're going to correct it . " He said a year 's experience was a " fair test , " but many staffers disagreed . Said Edwin Diamond , former associate editor of Tonight : " Management did not give it enough time . 60 Minutes was given ten years to find its audience . "
