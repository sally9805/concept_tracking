It ' s time to heat up the back yard grills . There is no better way to start off the grilling season than with everyone ' s all-time favorite , hamburgers . This recipe is for hamburgers stuffed with a spicy cheese mixture that melts to a creamy consistency . But to begin the meal , a hearty , creamy soup has black beans as a base . To ensure tender beans , soak them in water overnight , then drain . As with any bean recipe , do not add salt until the soup is finished . Salt tends to toughen the skins of the beans . This soup can be made several days ahead and refrigerated . The flavor will mellow with standing . A bit more beef broth may be needed to thin the soup if it becomes too thick . Jicama , an unusual root vegetable , is used raw in this slaw . The flavor of jicama is reminiscent of sweet potatoes , a closely related plant . But jicama is less sweet and a bit more fibrous .
