ADVENTURES OF THE MIND The Theology of Self-Esteem 1 feel a restiveness in man , " the late Dr. Robert Ardrey wrote , " a dissatisfaction of a univer- sal sort . The average human being , as I judge it , is uneasy . He is like a man who is hungry , gets up at night , opens the refrigerator door and does n't exactly see what he wants because he does n't know what he wants . He closes the door and goes back to bed . " Not knowing what we really want , we go through life with a strange inner hunger unsatisfied . It 's something like having a holiday without knowing exactly what you want to do , where you want to go or how you want to spend your limited time . When you finally decide , it 's too late . A little boy was given a quarter to spend in any way he chose . Walking through a toy store , the coin burning in his hand , he first fondled a book , then a plasticcar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched , the more confused he became over how to spend his quarter . He just could n't make up his mind . Finally he bought a whistle . He left the store happily blowing the whistle , thrilling to its music . By the time he was halfway home , he had grown tired of its sound . Finally he broke into tears and cried , " Why did I buy a whistle ? I did n't want a whistle after all ! " He had spent his money on something he only thought he wanted . There are many people traveling through life like this . They come mournfully to the end of their lives , unsatisfied , unfulfilled , sadly suspecting that they never found what they really wanted . What do you want more than anything else in the world ? What is the basic , driving force in life ? The chances are you do n't really know the answers to those all-important questions . Philosophers , psychologists , anthropologists and theologians have probed for many centuries into the nature of man in an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at some of their conclusions . The Will to Live ? " Man 's basic urge is survival , " the anthropologist Jean Pierre Hal-let told me . Many will agree . Unless you are mentally ill , you want to survive . The will to live is a fantastically powerful drive , but survival is not in itself the greatest or the only motivating force . Legions of sane people have rationally chosen to risk death to reach goals they valued more highly than life itself . Love of country has stirred millions to march off to war ready and willing to make the supreme sacrifice . Millions of sensible human beings have chosen to die rather than to live in shame . The Will to Seek Pleasure ? The will to experience pleasure , according to Sigmund Freud , explains the basic deep-seated wants of human beings . Beyond a doubt , the will to have pleasure is a very real and very powerful force behind human behavior . On the other hand , men and women by the millions have been known to forsake physical pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man craves something much deeper than pleasure . The appetites of the eye , the stomach , the ear and the sex organs can be satisfied , and yet the human spirit hungers for something beyond those immediate satisfactions . The Will to Wield Power ? The esteemed psychiatrist Alfred Adler suggested that the will to achieve power explains everything . The desire to be in control , the craving to be king , the exhilaration of being able to command  --  all illustrate clearly man 's drive for power . The bloody pages of history offer horrendous evidence that man will kill , cheat , lie and betray his own soul in his pursuit ofpower . Yet power does not produce ultimate satisfaction . On the contrary , power often produces enormous anxiety and feelings of insecurity . The man on the top is the man who is shot at , threatened and challenged by those who seek his office . The economic , military , technological and intellectual powers of this country are without equal . Yet all this power fails to command complete respect from other nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I submit that neither the will to survive , nor the will to experience pleasure nor the will to exercise power is at the root of human motives and actions . To cite any of these forces as the basic urge of man is like mistakenly considering the swirling streams on the surface of a river as the major current in that body of water . While the surface waters of human emotion swirl The will to live is a powerful drive , but survival is not the greatest or the only motivating force . and distract , in the depths below there lies a powerful primeval urge that is hidden from view and must be discovered before we can accomplish our real goals . Let us look at some other theories about the basic drives of mankind . The Will to Find Meaning ? Viktor Frank ! detects a deep and powerful undercurrent in human motivational forces when he suggests that the will to find meaning is the ultimate will of man . With perception , he has pointed out that man is able to achieve mental and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may explain why some people are able to achieve peace of mind in the midst of enormous suffering and frustration . They can see meaning in it all . But deep inside we seek something beyond meaning . The Will to Create ? Every human being finds satisfaction when he sees the results of his creativity . So some human beings deprive themselves of pleasure , power , even love to pursue a vastly rewarding creative enterprise in some lonely attic . It is obvious that many people suffer from frustration and subsequent anxieties because they are performing a menial task and their latent creative potential finds no means of expression . Indeed , creativity is a strong subsurface current in man . But the craving to be creative is not the basic force we are seeking . The Will to Feel Self-Esteem ? I suggest that to achieve self-esteem is the ultimate will of man ? that what we really want more than anything else in the world is the awareness that we are worthy persons . It is the deepest of all the currents which drives persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pleasure , power , love , meaning , creativity  --  are symptoms , expressions or attempts to fulfill that primal need for personal dignity . Examine the will to find pleasure , for instance . Ask yourself this question : What 's the difference between pleasure and labor ? That which is fun for you may be work for someone else . I have always enjoyed deep-sea fishing . One day in the waters off Catalina I hooked a huge fish . What a struggle until I brought him close enough for the skipper to gaff him . I was exhausted ! But I was also exhilarated . Now suppose this was the way I earned my living  --  day after day . This " work " would have left me tired and exhausted , eager to see the end of the day . Why did I find the experience pleasurable ? Because I was able to escape completely from my everyday problems . Work is fun when it is exciting enough or distracting enough to make us forget ourselves completely . At that time I was unhappy with myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping from myself . For milContinued on page 84 Self- Esteem continued from page 44 lions of people the pursuit of pleasure is often a neurotic attempt to escape from the tension of consciously living with an unattractive self . The quest for self-esteem sheds light on many sexual adventures . For many people sex is a clumsy attempt to build self-esteem . The teen-age girl surrenders to the aggressive male for fear that she may lose him if she does n't go " all the way . " A quick analysis might indicate that it is a fear of rejection that motivates this sexual promiscuity . Deeper analysis would show that she unconsciously assumes that if she is rejected she will hate herself . How can she love herself if the boys do n't want her ? It has been observed that the wandering male in his 40s who moves from one affair to the next is driven by a deep insecurity . At the expense of another person 's dignity , he tries to prove to himself that he 's " quite a man ! " He fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any affair that treats individuals as so many " things . " At the same time this same man may be making the tragic mistake of assuming that ( 1 ) if he achieves power and influence , people will know him ; ( 2 ) if they know him , they might love him ; ( 3 ) if they love him , then he will love himself ; ( 4 ) if he is in a position of power , he will be able to compel people to respect him . He does n't realize that power is not what he really wants  --  but rather , real self-esteem . Where the will to feel pleasure is often a neurotic escape from facing oneself , the will to possess power is frequently a crude attempt to prove " I 'm a great guy . " This explains the behavior of a man I shall call George Smith , who had a strong drive to be the president of his company . He worked hard and struggled and after many years built a successful national sales organization . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was excited . Because of this exciter tient he thought he had achieved happiness . Than things began to fall apart . Business fell off . First it was necessary to close the New York office , then the Chicago office . As his empire crumbled , he saw himself losing the entire business he had worked for years to build . The terrible day came when he had to close his last office . Here is how George Smith tells his story : " I locked the door of my office . Never had I felt so low as I did when I turned my back on the door of my broken dreams . I walked slowly to the parking lot , got into my car and headed for home . Oh , God , it was all I had left ! I stepped into the house . I expected to hear my wife call out , Is that you , dear ? ' I heard nothing . I walked to the kitchen and found a note : ' I 've gone shopping . Be home late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . " Suddenly the door opened . It was my little girl , home from school . She put her lunch box on the table , spotted me and called , ' Daddy ! How come you 're home so early ? ' I answered , ' Well , honey , Daddy is changing jobs , but let 's not talk about it now . Okay ? ' Then my daughter jumped on my lap , hugged me tight around the neck , pressed her soft and warm face against my face , and gave me the warmest , sweetest kiss , saying , ' Oh , Daddy , I love you so much ! ' That did it . I really cracked up . My lips quivered . She said , ' What 's wrong , Daddy ? ' I said , ' Nothing , honey , nothing at all . There is absolutely nothing wrong ! ' " And I really meant it . In that moment I discovered that I had what I really wanted . Suddenly my whole life unfolded before me : a young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recognized , in order to feel important , in order to be loved , in order to really respect myself ! Well , I had what I wanted . It was here in my lap ! I was loved . And in loving and being loved , I found my sense of self-worth , self-respect and self-dignity . " So it is the will to possess dignity , not the will to possess power , that man seeks . Man is a dignity-seeker  --  not a status seeker . He makes a terrible mistake if he thinks that status will insure self-worth . This may explain why a very suc-cessful " status seeker " resigned his job soon after he arrived at the top . " It did not satisfy me ; it made me ill . I had Continued on page 87 to pretend to love people I did n't and could n't love . I had to overlook things that I knew were wrong . I had to surrender moral and ethical principles to get to the top and to stay at the top . In my happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel ! But I was not satisfied ! I was not satisfied because I could not respect myself for what all this was doing to my sense of values . So I quit . " Of course ! He quit because he learned that he was not getting what he thought he wanted . He did not get what he wanted because he did not know that what he really wanted was exalted self-esteem . Even the will to love is a clever mask hiding the deeper and undetected will to feel self-esteem . As infants we learn that we love and are usually loved in return , which leaves us with a wonderful feeling of well-being . We fail to perceive that this sense of well-being is really an experience of self-esteem . So we go through life driven by the compulsion to love  --  unaware that what we really seek is not love as an end to itself , but love as food to nourish our dignity . Again we discover , early in life , that a wonderful feeling of well-being sweeps over us when we love other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we stop short of labeling that sense of well-being what it really is  --  self-esteem . So the will to love and to be loved is a compulsion either to share our strong self-esteem or to support our shaky self-esteem . Even the will to discover meaning , under critical analysis , will prove to be an expression of the will to achieve self-esteem . Even meaning loses meaning unless it fulfills our self-esteem . If we see no other meaning in our existence , no meaning in our suffering , no meaning in our achievement , no meaning in our love , we will not be able to live with ourselves . On the other hand , we can tolerate unbelievable suffering if we can see some good that will come out of it . We feel we are worthwhile when we see meaning bestowing dignity on our troubles . Meaning is empty unless it feeds and nourishes our self-esteem . What about the will to create ? A watchmaker who constructs a watch is able to look at his creation and see himself in the work materialized before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is a worthwhile person . So the will to create is really a constructive and wholesome attempt to satisfy the deeper ultimate goalself-es teem . Man is a pleasure-seeking , power-seeking , lone-seeking , meaning-seeking , creativity-seeking animal because he is first and foremost a Continued on following page dignity-seeking creature . You are on the road to emotional , mental and spiritual health when you discover that what you really want more than anything else in life is neither survival nor pleasure , nor power , nor love , nor meaning . What you really want is to be able to know and appreciate yourself . The Universal Will to Achieve Self-Esteem This will to possess self-esteem is universal . It shows its disguised , often distorted and disfigured face in all ages , among all races and nationalities . The Oriental must save face . Primitive tribes stoutly support their pride with warfare and the adornment of ears , lips and body with self-esteem-feeding embellishments . It explains why the Yanks are so cocky ; the English snobbish ; the French haughty ; the Spanish arrogant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scandinavians determined ; the Greeks , Italians , Slovaks and native American Indians proud ; and the Jews ( according to their own chronicler ) stiff-necked . Desmond Morris , in his book The Naked Ape , is awe-stricken by the profound question : " Why is Man  --  of all the primates  --  hairless ? " If the pelts of all the primates were stretched out in a row , Mr. Morris reminds us , one pelt would stand out with startling uniqueness . It has no hair ! Why ? How did Homo sapiens get bald ? A far more important observation might be made if we placed all of the primates , alive and squirming , in a row of cages . We would note that one primate stands out from all the rest ! One primate is driven by a hunger for self-esteem . Why ? How did Homo sapiens develop such a strong will to possess self-esteem ? I asked Viktor Frankl : " If it is true that all living organisms have evolved from a slimy amoeba in a swampy pool , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural evolution , can you tell me how the human being ever evolved into a creature that demands dignity ? Why , of all organisms , does the human being have this craving for dignity , self-respect and self-esteem ? " " The answer to that question , " he replied , " is one I really do n't know . " Abraham Kaplan , formerly of the philosophy department of the University of Michigan , was giving the Adolph Meyer lecture at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in Los Angeles . In his message he challenged these psychiatrists ( including a few nonpsychiatrists such as myself ) : " Oftentimes it seems to me that psychiatrists have a way of saying , ' I do n't know , ' when actually they are dodging their commitments . Cowardice is disguised as humility . You do n't want to admit it , but the real truth is that the human being is this way because there is a God and we are the reflections of God , just as surely as the moon is the reflection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great self-esteem-seeker . Why ? Carlyle came close to the answer when he wrote , " Man was made for greatness ! " Genesis tells us that man was made in the image of God . And the Psalmist added that man is just " a little lower than the angels . " Suddenly the Holy Bible seems logical and very scientific . According to the Bible , the first human being was created a little like God : with the urge to be creative , a desire to act gloriously and a compulsion to live life on a grand scale . So God placed man in charge of God 's ordered creation , to rule , exercise dominion and be the great decision-making creature . Man was a supreme display incarnate ! He was the star of God 's creation ! So the urge for greatness , the compulsion to create , the passion for excellence , the desire for recognition , the discontent with imperfection , the demand for personal freedom , the need to give and receive love , even the desire to rule and dominate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human being to be great , glorious and perfectly proud . When a person senses that he is near greatness , at the beginning of something big , at the edge of glory , at the brink of success , on the stairway to stardom , his heart beats fast and his blood stirs , his pulse pounds with happy anticipation ! For he was born for greatness ! We sense that we were born for something bigger and better than we know today . We keep moving restlessly onward and upward , seeking a dignity we instinctively know is our heritage . The human creature is unique in that he is a self-esteem-seeking animal . This , then , is what I have chosen to call a Theology of Self-Es-teem . And from this unshakable foundation there rise five precepts within this theology . ( 1 ) a Theology of Commun-ication : I have no right to insult , embarrass or violate any person 's dignity by written or spoken word . ( 2 ) A Theology of Evange-lism : I have no right to offend the self-esteem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul . " My evangelism must appeal to and respect his dignity as a person . I can not manipulate or intimidate him into the Kingdom of God . ( 3 ) A Theolo-gy of Social Ethics : Any act or deed becomes unethical if it lowers  --  how-ever immeasurably  --  that invisible but all-important mental climate in a com-munity that I call " Society 's Collec-tivized Level of Self-Esteem . " Do abor-tion and suicide make us more proud of ourselves as a human race ? Or do they produce some embarrassment or shame ? ( 4 ) A Theology of Economics : How can we eradicate the real sin of poverty  --  which is the loss of dignity the oppressed experience ? By a hand-out ? Or by an inspiring faith to discover and develop their God-given abilities through Possibility Thinking ? ( 5 ) A Theology of Government : It is no coincidence that the democratic system of government created in 1776 in the United States of America was inspired by the Calvinist theologians who held the dignity of man as the cornerstone of faith .
