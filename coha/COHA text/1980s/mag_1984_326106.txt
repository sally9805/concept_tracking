AIDS cases increase , but new research shows some signs of hope <P> When the disease first appeared five years ago , it seemed an impenetrable mystery . The best minds in medicine could not explain the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or why it mainly struck homosexual men , intravenous drug users , Haitians and hemophiliacs . Nor could they begin to cure it . Six months ago came news of a breakthrough : scientists at the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) in Bethesda , Md. , and the Pasteur Institute in Paris had discovered a virus that seemed to be closely related to , if not the cause of , the epidemic . The finding was hailed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler as " the triumph of science over a dread disease . " <P> It was not quite that . But in recent months , the virus has served as something of a Rosetta stone in the efforts to decipher the enigmas of AIDS . It has also made possible the development of a test that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important step toward preventing the spread of AIDS by transfusions . Last week , at the annual meeting of the American Association of Blood Banks in San Antonio , and at gatherings of AIDS-related groups in New York City and San Francisco , the new developments were the major topic of discussion . Finally , it appears , a few facts are emerging from the morass of fear and confusion . <P> The good news is that aside from 86 transfusion-linked cases , the epidemic has not struck the general population . But the bad news continues relentlessly for the four major risk groups . So far , 6,517 cases of AIDS have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta ; 72% were in male homosexuals . The number of new cases this year is twice that of 1983 and probably will continue to double . Nearly half the victims have died , although the ultimate mortality rate may be 90% or higher . <P> The one ray of hope in this grim picture is the rapid pace of research with the newly identified AIDS virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pasteur group and by the NCI team under Dr. Robert Gallo are the same microbe . They are , however , slightly different strains , " like two brothers , " explains Jean-Claude Chermann of Pasteur . Though a few questions remain , most researchers are now convinced that the virus is indeed the primary cause of AIDS . The evidence is compelling : <P> &gt; Virtually all AIDS patients have identifiable antibodies to the virus in their blood . These antibodies are almost unknown in the general population . <P> &gt; Researchers have produced antibodies and even early symptoms of AIDS in chimpanzees by injecting them with the virus or with blood plasma from AIDS patients . <P> &gt; The virus has been found in the blood , semen and saliva* of AIDS patients and patients with early signs of the disease ; the finding is significant , since doctors have long suspected that the disease is spread by the exchange of body fluids , especially through anal intercourse and shared hypodermic needles .                @ @ @ @ @
