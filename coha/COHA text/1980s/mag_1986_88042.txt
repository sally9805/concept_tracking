Before Don Sutton even left the dugout for the ninth inning last Wednesday night , the Anaheim Stadium crowd of 37,044 was on its feet , clapping and cheering in a ground swell of support . The Angel righthander had a 5-1 lead over Texas and was bidding to become the 19th pitcher in major league history to win 300 games . Sutton would say later : " It was the sweetest roar I 've ever heard . " // The clamor increased as Scott Fletcher and Oddibe McDowell both flied out to centerfield . In the Angel infield , first baseman Wally Joyner grinned at second baseman Rob Wilfong , who described the noise level as " awesome . " After Sutton worked a 1-and-2 count on Gary Ward , catcher Bob Boone signaled for a slider . Ward lunged at the pitch , tipping it back to Boone , who held on tight to Sutton 's ticket to Cooperstown. // Teammates swarmed Sutton as the scoreboard flashed " 300 " and the organist launched into God Bless America . After Sutton crossed the third base line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hugged the 41-year-old. // It had been Sutton 's second try at 300 . The first ended with no decision in a nationally televised game four days earlier against Kansas City . The Game of the Week was n't the right setting , anyway , for a man who has never sought  --  and rarely found  --  the limelight . // When Sutton joined the Dodgers in 1966 for his first big league season , he labored in the long shadows of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale , and was even dubbed Little D to Drysdale 's Big D. Sutton has never won the Cy Young Award , and has only one 20-win season  --  every other 300-game winner has at least three . Sutton never led the league in wins or strikeouts . Yet he pitched 200 innings in every season except strike-shortened 1981 , and he holds the record with at least 100 strikeouts in 20 consecutive seasons . // When he made headlines , it was his celebrated 1978 scuffle with Steve Garvey or a shakedown by an umpire who suspected Sutton of doctoring the baseball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said of his 300th win , " I tried legally and illegally for years to get here . " // In No. 300 he held Texas to three hits , struck out three , walked none and needed only 87 pitches . The win made Sutton one of only six pitchers with 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts. // " If I had to have someone make a general statement about my playing , " Sutton said , " it would be that I hardly ever missed a turn . " The Little D obviously stands for dependability . Sutton learned responsibility growing up in the Florida panhandle town of Molino . " My dad chased cows on cold mornings and poured concrete on hot July afternoons so I could have gloves and shoes , " he said . // Last week after the big game was over , Sutton sipped from a glass of 1983 Robert Pepi Chardonnay . He confessed to " a twinge of sadness " because the 300-win goal was , as he put it , " not there anymore . " Finally , his face brightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 'd love to win a World Series . " // Winning , after all , is what it 's all about , and last week Don Sutton won a place in baseball history .
