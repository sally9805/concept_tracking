FAIRFIELD , Conn.  --  General Electric Co. abandoned plans by its RCA Corp. unit to build a $200 million semiconductor plant in a joint venture with Sharp Corp. of Japan . Meantime , as the $6. 46 billion acquisition of RCA begins to take shape , GE outlined severance package plans for 500 RCA staff employees . An unspecified number also received layoff notices . GE said it decided to shut down the semiconductor joint venture because it has its own new facilities in Research Triangle Park , N.C. The planned factory , which was to be built in Camas , Wash. , would have employed 650 workers . GE said it will reimburse the state for public roads and facilities built for the plant as well as pay expenses of winding down the operation . Separately , GE yesterday reported that second-quarter earnings , which were reduced slightly by the RCA acquisition , rose 5. 3% to $621 million , or $1. 36 a share , from $590 million , or $1. 30 a share , a year earlier . Sales , including $803 million from RCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . Analysts said earnings were in line with expectations , but some expressed disappointment that the RCA acquisition actually reduced GE earnings  --  albeit only one cent a share  --  rather than contributed to them . In the first half , GE ' s net income rose 5. 2% to $1. 16 billion , or $2. 54 a share , from $1. 1 billion , or $2. 42 a share . Sales rose 5% to $13. 67 billion from $13. 04 billion . John F. Welch Jr . , GE ' s chairman , said that by the end of this year the three major acquisitions made under his tenure  --  RCA , Kidder Peabody &; Co. , and Employers Reinsurance Corp.  --  will each contribute to earnings above their acquisition costs . GE ' s earnings for the next year will be affected by its acquisitions and won ' t be directly comparable with prior year ' s earnings . An RCA spokesman said the decision to end the semiconductor joint venture won ' t " necessarily " affect RCA ' s prior plans to build a $22 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Center . That decision will be made by a GE-led study team looking at the companies ' semiconductor operations . GE said its parting with Sharp was " amicable " and costs associated with paying Washington state and relocating or laying off the venture ' s 91 employees won ' t be material . On staffing decisions , sources close to RCA said that included in an unspecified number of the 500 RCA severance package plans were layoff notices , effective Sept. 15 . Neither RCA nor GE would say how many RCA employees got layoff notices yesterday . About 50 RCA staff employees so far  --  excluding those who received severance plans  --  have been offered GE jobs , RCA said . The remainder have been asked to stay for an unspecified amount of time or told that they will be needed for up to 1 1/2 years . The special RCA severance packages , which are sweeter than RCA ' s regular , pre-acquisition packages , are part of GE ' s plans to make sure that its corporate staff at the beginning of 1988 is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , when it had 1 , 500 employees . Partly because of those plans , it had been expected that GE would reduce staffing levels at the combined company . A GE spokeswoman said some GE corporate staffers could also be let go along with RCA staffers as the two companies consolidate , but she couldn ' t say how many . The RCA packages were provided to employees in corporate affairs , corporate planning and development , employee relations , finance , law and the secretary ' s office . Employees will get two months notice of an impending layoff and can ' t get the severance pay and benefits without a layoff notice . About 1 , 000 RCA corporate staff members involved in that company ' s internal information systems , licensing and other departments didn ' t get packages , GE said , because GE doesn ' t technically consider those employees to be at the corporate staff level . One benefits counselor said the RCA severance plan was " pretty similar " to plans of other companies making staff cuts , such as Exxon Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more painful to employees because it probably wouldn ' t have occured if GE hadn ' t bought the company and will occur over a longer period of time . " It ' s much more difficult if you don ' t know how long you ' ll be around , because you don ' t know when to mount your campaign " to get a new job , said the counselor , who asked not to be named . While the new RCA package sweetens the regular RCA severance package , one employee doubted it was better than what GE provides to laid-off employees . Depending on how many employees eventually get severance pay , GE said the plan will cost it between $10 million and $15 million . A GE spokeswoman said the RCA package is designed to give those with layoff notices " a soft landing " and in some cases doubles severance pay that they would have received under the regular RCA plan , particularly for employees with fewer years of service . For example , under RCA ' s regular plan , a laid-off employee with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four months pay . Under the special plan , the employee will get eight months pay , or double . An older employee , with 35 years of service would have received one year ' s pay under the regular RCA plan ; under the sweetened plan , he will get 16 months pay , or a third more . RCA employees taking the severance package are required to sign a statement discharging RCA and GE for all claims against RCA or GE arising from employment by RCA , failure of RCA or GE to offer employment , or termination . Such statements , said one attorney , are used to guard against lawsuits . Earlier this week , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that Du Pont Co. discriminated against employees older than 65 and those with more than 35 years of service with the company when it offered early retirement last year .
