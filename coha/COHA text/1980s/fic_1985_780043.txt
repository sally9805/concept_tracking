 | here bread , ' and the Quimpers agreed that it was palatable . It was more than that . It 's damned good , ' Jubal said , and he told Mattie : Remember how he did it . Stay away from them red oaks . ' On a summer day in 1824 , as Mattie poled her ferry across the Brazos , she saw well to the west a phenomenon which did not startle her but which did attract her attention . As she explained later : ' I thought nothin ' of it , at first . Dark clouds along the horizon , but after a while I realized they were darker than any I 'd seen before . And they did n't move like an ordinary storm . Just hung there , like a distant curtain . ' While the darkness intensified without any visible motion , she deposited her passenger on the far shore : Mister , somethin ' strange . I 'd watch for cover . ' ' What do you think it is ? ' the man asked , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some place back there is catchin ' rain . And if they 're gettin ' it now , we 'll get it soon . ' When she returned to her own side of the river she called for Jubal , but he was off tracking honey bees , so she spent a few minutes outside , studying the storm : ' Yancey ! Come here and see this cloud . ' When the boy stood with her , she repeated : ' Somebody upriver 's catchin ' a lot of rain , ' and soon thereafter Jubal came running home with news that the river was rising . For most of that long summer day the tremendous black clouds remained motionless along the northwestern horizon , depositing enormous quantities of rain , so that as dusk approached , the Brazos showed a sullen rise of nearly a foot . Jubal said : ' If it starts to rain here , Mattie , that river could really run wild . ' When the first drops did come splattering down , just at nightfall , Mattie told her men : ' I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , ' and by the time she poled it across the river to the more protected anchoring place on the opposite shore , the rain was falling not in drops but in torrents , and she realized that it was bound to lift the river level so drastically that she would have to remain there through the night and away from the turbulent center of the rampaging river . She was drenched . Hair , eyes , clothes , hands , all were soaked in the lashing rain . From time to time as she poled away from the uncontrolled flood she became aware that great trees , uprooted from the northwest , were moving down the current , and these she must avoid . Will the cabin survive ? she asked herself toward dawn when it became apparent that this was to be a historic flood , far in excess of any whose remnants Jubal had pointed out to her on that first day . Pray God it does n't reach our hill . In its outer reaches , of course , the great flood was not a swift-moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes hardly moving at all , but remorselessly it submerged everything ; only at the center of the riverbed did the waters form a foaming , rampaging , irresistible torrent . Fifty miles to the south , where the distance between the Brazos and the Colorado narrowed to a corridor , the flood  | became so tremendous that the back waters from the two rivers actually joined in a great sweeping ocean . At Quimper 's Ferry the flood rose so high , it drove Mattie three miles inland before she managed to tie her craft to the branches of an oak whose trunk was seven feet under water . There she remained for two o cold days until she saw that the waters were beginning to recede , whereupon she poled across fields to where the ferry was customarily tied , and as the waters swiftly dropped , she crossed the Brazos and brought her craft home . We thought you was dead , ' her husband said matter-offactly as she climbed up to her rain-soaked cabin , and she told him : I thought I was , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their undamaged home , then kissed her husband : Thank God , Jubal , you made us build up here . ' Yancey broke in : When the flood came three feet up the wall we thought we was done . But The Kronk led Pop and me to that grove of oaks and tied ourself in a tree . ' Jubal hushed him : We was all lucky . And for that we can thank God . I wish Father Clooney was here to lead us in prayer . ' And for the next hundred years people along the Brazos would remember it as the year the Brazos ran wild ' or the year the rivers joined . ' Mattie recalled it as the year I lost my corn . ' The Quimpers were less lucky with another event caused by the flood , and this 6i too would be remembered . The excessive waters disturbed many animals , causing them to venture into new areas and adopt new habits , and one of those most seriously displaced was a huge rattlesnake eight feet three inches long from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tree . He was really a monstrous creature , with a head as big as a soup plate and fangs so huge and powerful , they could discharge a dreadful injection . Veteran of many struggles , master of the sudden ambush , he had subdued baby pigs and fawns and rabbits and a multitude of rats and mice . His traditional home had been sixteen miles up the Brazos in a rocky ledge that gave him excellent protection and a steady supply of victims , but the floods had dislodged him and sent him tumbling down the river along with deer and alligators and javelinas . During the height of the flood each animal was so preoccupied with its own salvation that it ignored friends and enemies alike , but as the waters receded , each resumed its habits , and the snake found itself far downstream , lodged in unfamiliar rocks and with a most uncertain food supply . The rattler now had to be more venturesome than usual , and began foraging far from its crevice . Sometimes it went down close to the river , exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland , watching always to be sure that it had adequate cover to protect it from the blazing sun whose unimpeded heat would kill it . Mice , rabbits , squirrels , birds  --  the great reptile devoured them all , stunning them first with sharp jabs of its fangs , then swallowing them slowly and constricting its belly muscles to break down the bones and digest the food . The rattler was a fearsome beast , made more so by frontier legend , most of it spurious : It cai n't strike at you elsen it 's coiled . Needs the springin ' power of its coils . Then it can reach out twice its length . ' Coiled , it could strike with remark-  | able accuracy ; uncoiled , less so , and never more than half its length . This monster could strike four feet , a menacing distance . The snake , he cai n't never strike you elsen he warns you first with a shake of his rattles . " God 's recompense , " we call it . ' Most of the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often at the approach of a man or a large animal , it activated its rattles furiously to scare away the intruder . A rattler is thrifty , carries just enough venom to kill a man . ' Later experts would demonstrate that whereas twenty-five milligrams would kill a child , and one hundred a man , a grown rattler could deliver two hundred fifty milligrams , enough to kill two men , while a really big snake could inject a thousand milligrams in one shot . One drop of rattlesnake venom in yore bloodstream , you 're dead . ' Many frontiersmen had been struck by medium-sized rattlers and survived , but to be injected with a full charge of venom by a snake as large as this one would be fatal . No man ai n't never been struck by a full-sized rattler and lived . ' A rattler carried only a limited supply of venom in its sacs , and if it had recently discharged this in killing some animal , it could strike its next victim with the full force of its fangs and inflict only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had survived as a result of this phenomenon . This great beast at Quimper 's Ferry , longer than any hitherto seen along the Brazos , did not seek contact with human beings ; it did its best to avoid them , but if any threatened the quiet of its domain , it could strike with terrifying force . It would not have come into contact with the Quimpers had not Yancey gone probing along the farther bank , not doing any serious work or accomplishing much , but merely poking into holes with a stick to see what might be happening . As he approached where the snake lay hidden , he heard but did not recognize the warning rattle . Thinking it to be a bird or some noisy insect , he probed further , and found himself staring at the huge coiled snake not ten feet away . Mom ! ' he screamed , and Mattie , working at the ferry , grabbed the gun she kept aboard for protection against wandering Karankawa , and ran to help , but when she reached Yancey she found him immobilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do something ! ' he pleaded . Infuriated by his craven behavior and terrified of the snake , she pushed her son aside , and with her heart beating at a rate which must soon cause her to faint , she raised the gun . Not firing blindly , because she knew she had only one chance , she took aim as the snake prepared for its deadly thrust , and pulled the trigger . She felt the shock against her shoulder ; she felt the snake brush against her knee ; and she fainted . Yancey , seeing only that the rattler had struck at his mother and that she had fallen , concluded that the snake had killed her , despite the gun blast , and ran screaming up the river to the ferry landing : Pop ! A big rattler killed Mom . ' Jubal and The Kronk waded and swam across the Brazos and ran trembling to  | where Mattie still lay beside the dreadful snake , and when they saw her they supposed that each had killed the other . Snake hit her just as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian saw her right hand twitch , and when he stepped gingerly past the snake and lifted her head , he saw that she was still breathing . Inspecting her throat and face , he called : ' No dead . Scared . Scared . ' Jubal and Yancey , taking over from the Indian , satisfied themselves that Mattie was indeed alive , and with a love they had not shown before , they carried her upriver to the ferry , where they placed her tenderly aboard , but before they pushed off , The Kronk ran up carrying the enormous snake , whose head had been blown apart . ' We keep , ' he said , and the men knew that he intended eating at least part of the fearful enemy out of respect and envy for the courage it had shown . When Jubal tanned the skin he stretched it to maximum length , extending the accordionlike scales until he had an awesome object that climbed the entire wall of the cabin and back four feet along the ceiling , ten feet , five inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attached it so that it appeared to be striking at the diners seated below , and strangers seeing it for the first time said : They wam't never a snake that big , ' but Jubal said proudly : Finger them rattlers yourself . They 're real , and my little wife 's the one who killed it . ' Whenever Mattie looked at the fearful object she thought not of her own heroism in battling the monster but of her son 's behavior . She never spoke of this to the boy 's father , and certainly not to the boy himself , but she did often recall her own father 's stern admonition to his children when they were living in a Tennessee hovel and subsisting on beans with an occasional slab of pork : You do n't have to fight the world , and you do n't have to be the bravest in the village , but by God , if you 're my kids , you got to do what 's right when you face danger . I do n't care if the other man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manic had gone at the great serpent 's throat ; her son had not . Mattie kept her small collection of coins gained from running the ferry in the canvas bag which had once protected her corn , and one morning when she felt satisfied that she had saved enough , she asked a farmer who was heading downriver to the rude store at Austin 's headquarters at San Felipe to perform a commission for her ; and two months later a man on horseback arrived bearing a small keg of nails and a long package . It was a pit saw with two big handles , and when it was assembled she told her husband : We 'll rip us some planks and build us a real house . I 'll live underground no more . ' The Kronk was essential to her plans , for she needed his strength to dig a pit deep enough for a man to stand in : ' And now cut the tallest , thickest tree trunk you can move to the pit . ' And when it was hauled across the pit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do the dirty work . You do the strong . ' Grasping the lower handle , she pushed the saw up , while one of the men  | standing astride the log topside pulled it into cutting position . Then the men bore down while Mattie pulled , and in this laborious way , with sawdust in her face day after day , she supervised the cutting of the planks needed for her house . She never complained , for she kept before her the vision of the home that was to be , and when she felt she had enough planks , she climbed out of her pit , dragooned two travelers to stay as helpers , and started building her house . At various places in Texas she had seen the type of house she wanted ; it had come west from South Carolina and Georgia and provided an excellent device for surviving in a hot or humid climate . It 's called a dog-run , ' Mattie explained to The Kronk , who did much of the heavy work . We build a little square house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , same size , over here . ' Why here , here ? ' the Indian asked , and she said : One house sleeping . One house living , ' and he said : Work too damn much . ' Then she explained that the two squares would not remain separated : Up there , one long roof over everything . Down here , one long porch , end to end . ' In between , what ? ' The Kronk asked , and she said : Place for cool breezes . Place for dogs to run in the day , sleep at night . ' He then wanted to know what the porch was for , and she said : Work done , we watch sunset . Travelers come , they sleep on porch , ' and he said approvingly : Damn good . ' When it was completed , with liberal use of improvised wattle-and-vine walls that would serve until more planks could be cut , Mattie waited till Reverend Harrison came by on his way to Stephen Austin 's headquarters : Will you bless this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quimpers would enjoy years of happiness and prosperity in it , but some weeks later , when Harrison was returning , from his talk with Austin , he appeared at the door of the house unannounced , to find Jubal and two travelers playing cards and swigging from a jug of muscadine wine . Made saw the flare of disgust that crossed his face as he said : Do you allow gaming in a house I dedicated to the Lord ? ' I do , ' she said . Jesus drank wine . ' Coming close to pronouncing anathema upon her , he cried : You and your husband and all of them stand in danger of being rejected of God . Gaming and drinking , they 'll be the ruin of Texas . ' Jubal had always known it was bound to happen , and now it was upon him : Reverend Harrison and Father Clooney had arrived at the same time , and somkind of ugly confrontation seemed inescapable . The Protestant clergyman came first , on a surreptitious round of Methodist prayer meetings at which he delivered agitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country : They threw out the Spanish , as we know . But before long they invited that fool Iturbide to make himself emperor , and what American would want to live under the dictates of an emperor ? '  | A man who had traveled in Mexico said dryly : They shot him last year , ' but this did not alter Harrison 's diatribe : Each day men like Iturbide remain in control , the yoke of Rome is fastened ever more tightly about our necks . Each day we do not resist , we become more surely the vassals of the Pope , and I can feel in my bones the constant loss of freedom we 're undergoing . We 're in peril , and we must bind ourselves ever closer or we shall lose our freedom , our church and our understanding of God . ' Night after night he conducted his frenzied meetings , until he had many of the farmers almost prepared to take up arms to defend their rights , and he was equally persuasive with women , for he spoke eloquently of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons of Protestantism : Do you want your daughters to become nuns , locked away in some convent , the prey of priests , never to know the blessings of a true Christian home ? ' He also frightened them with graphic descriptions of what it meant to worship regularly in the Catholic mode , and he nailed down his preaching with a plea which came from the heart : The Protestant church is the true church of Jesus Christ . He called it forth . He ordained us to do His great work on earth . And we must remain faithful to His precepts . ' He was effective because his listeners , hungry for moral guidance , always knew where he stood . He was for the New Testament , morality and Methodism ; he was against Rome , alcohol , sexual indulgence , dancing and any kind of irreverence . But in this summer of 1825 he added a bold new dimension to his preaching : I can not believe that the good Christians who came to Texas from Kentucky and Tennessee will long continue under the tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , he realized its implications : When that joyous day comes , we 'll join the United States . ' He justified this treasonous behavior as faith plus patriotism . ' He was conducting a secret meeting for elders at the Quimpers ' inn late one afternoon , with some twenty farmers surrounding him , when a watcher , posted to detect any approach of Mexican soldiers , ran in : Father Clooney comin ' on his mule . ' And when the conspirators peered out they saw the familiar figure of the Irish priest , older now and thinner , riding up to the porch . They had no opportunity to disperse before he dismounted , brushed the dust from his black vestments , and entered . One glance at the unusual number of guests and the tall minister who commanded them satisfied him as to what was happening , but he affected not to know . Greeting Reverend Harrison warmly , as if he were no more than some farmer he had met on the Trinity , he smiled at the others he had known before and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Father Clooney , of Ballyclooney , County Clare in Ireland , appointed by the Mexican government to be vicar of this parish . ' Having put the conspirators at ease , he then offended their leaders by asking Mattie Quimper : Could a perishing pilgrim have a wee nip ? ' and when she  | provided one , Reverend Harrison glared at the disgraceful cup as if he wished to turn its contents into vitriol . Father Clooney was filled with news acquired at the assembly of the Catholic clergy recently convened in San Antonio , and although his personal recollections of that meeting were not altogether pleasant , he was eager to share the substantial news which came from it . His unhappiness stemmed from the way he had been treated  --  as an interloping Irishman who spoke abominable Spanish  --  by the more austere Spanish priests who had been trained in Spain and the older Mexican fathers with their education in Mexico City and Queretaro . They had scorned him as a village nothing , a cactus-priest of the bayous , not really one of them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive drinking and of his casual approach to conversion , and many suspected that he was a secret agent sent by the American government to prepare the way for a Yankee takeover . But since none of them would have dreamed of moving one step north from San Antonio or of serving in wilderness areas like the banks of the Trinity , they were content to let this renegade Irishman do their pastoral work for them . His latest experience with these arrogant superiors had not been pleasant but it had been instructive , and now he gushed forth the resounding news : As you 've surely heard , there was a wonderful revolution in Mexico last year . Emperor Iturbide was overthrown by a group of sterling patriots , and the old viciousness has been cleansed away . A new Mexico , a new life for all of us . The hero of the change is a most splendid man , devout , loyal , brave . General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna . You 'll hear much of him in the glorious days ahead , for he brings freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that Santa Anna and his associates have given us a new constitution , and I promise you that in Mexican history the date 1824 will become as famous as 1776 is in your America . Because the Constitution of 1824 is a noble document , assuring us the freedoms we 've sought . It gives Coahuila-y-Tejas its own state government . It protects us . It guarantees a permanent republic . And it erases all memories of Emperor Iturbide and his follies . What a glorious day for Mex-ico ! ' His listeners soon caught the infection of his enthusiasm , for if what he said about the new constitution was true , most frictions with the central government would be eliminated , and Tejas , under its own regional government , would have a chance to forge ahead . But Reverend Harrison had a pertinent question : What  | does the new rule say about religion ? ' and Father Clooney answered forthrightly : It says that the official religion of Mexico must forever be Roman Catholicism . ' And will the official church be supported by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round-faced priest gave a straight answer : The church will be supported , as before , by the public treasury . ' ' If that is so , men who love freedom must oppose your new constitution . ' It was now dusk , and in the crowded dog-run two men of radically opposing views faced each other : Reverend Harrison , tall , austere , dreaming always of a greater Texas , and touched by God but unable because of the law to stand forth as the minister he was ; and Father Clooney , the sometimes wavering Roman Catholic priest who was not wholly accepted by his own church but who stumbled along , fortified by his love of Jesus Christ and his compassion for souls wandering in the Tejas wilderness . They were ill-matched . Harrison had more vigor and a much deeper conviction that what he was doing represented the drift of history and the will of Jesus Christ ; Father Clooney was older , wiser , better educated , and fortified by a church that had existed for eighteen hundred years . One important characteristic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was best for Texas , which they saw as one of the brightest hopes in North America or in the world . Very carefully the priest asked Harrison : You say you can not accept this excellent new law ? ' Not if it makes me pay for the support of a religion I can not trust . ' Clooney did not flinch at this harsh dismissal : Reverend Harrison ? Yes , I 've known since the day you started holding these secret meetings who you were and what your interests were . Have I tried to interrupt your preaching ? Have I put the soldiers to arresting you , which by law I should have done ? Have you and I not survived amiably , and are we not friends this evening ? If we trusted each other under that bad old constitution , surely we can do so under this good new one . ' Harrison and some of his people were stunned by the fact that Father Clooney had knowledge of their affairs , for they realized that they were subject to arrest , and one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you know ? ' and Clooney replied : Nothing . I would much rather have in Catholic Tejas people who were good Methodists than rascals who were poor Catholics and poor everything else . Friends ' ? and here his voice broke ? ' we are striving to build in Tejas a new society , a strong one , a decent one . We can not accomplish this if we are at each other 's throat . And you can not find the security you yearn for if you reject this new constitution . ' His urgent words struck a deep chord in Jubal Quimper 's heart : If the new law gives us everything we want except religious freedom , I say let 's accept it , because in the long run the press of people moving into Tejas will make it Protestant . ' Unwisely he looked at Father Clooney , expecting the priest to confirm this probability , but this the old man could not do : The new law says that Mexico is a  | Catholic nation . Up here , at the edge of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Antonio south , you will travel many days before you find a Protestant . Of course Mexico is Catholic , and of course it must remain so . But the good Catholics of that nation will continue to govern Texas much as they do now . You will enjoy respect and the ordinary freedoms . ' I do not believe it , ' Reverend Harrison snapped . Mark my words , we shall see Mexican troops along this river , coming here to enforce Catholicism and to put down Christianity . ' What a terrible error in words ! ' Father Clooney said instantly . No religion monopolizes Christianity . ' Catholicism tries to , ' Harrison snapped , and the meeting ended . Many partici- i pants , in later years when some of the issues thus raised had been settled , wrote ) accounts of this famous confrontation , and one almost illiterate farmer summarized it best : We had met at Queemper 's Ferry to pray and bad luck trayled us , for Father Cloony the Papist found us out and threttened to arrest us for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home hopeful for the days ahed becaws the new laws of Mexico sounded good , but feerful of the yeers ahed becaws we beleeved that Rev. Harison was right and that Texas would soon have to fite for her verry existance . Promulgation of the reassuring Constitution of 1824 had a curious aftermath . Hopeful newcomers like Jubal Quimper were now encouraged to think of themselves as Mexicans , citizens of a liberal democracy not unlike that in the United States , and then began to refer to themselves as Texicans , a fortunate verbal invention . Stands to reason , ' Jubal told Manie , if they 're Mexicans south of the Rio Grande , we ought to be Texicans north of it . ' And it was by this strong , l musical name that they knew themselves . Bathed in euphoria , the Texicans forgot Reverend Harrison 's prediction that they would soon be fighting for their existence , but in 1825 that prophecy came true . The enemy , however , was not Mexico . The remaining Karankawa decided they had no chance of living as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had intruded upon their historic territory . Intent upon defending themselves , they launched a series of raids so savage , so cruel in their extermination of lonely cabins and unprotected women that the settlers had no alternative but to fight back . Kill them now , or perish later ! ' was the mood at San Felipe as the settlers prepared for what they prayed would be the final battle . One group of volunteers assembled at Quimper 's Ferry , then marched south , where it would join men gathering along the coast . Since boys above the age of ten were expected to join the expedition with their own guns , Yancey , now aged thirteen , reported , and as the avengers approached the coast he felt his excitement  | mounting , for he was eager to perform well . But when they had sneaked close to one Karankawa settlement  --  a cluster of movable ba-acks , or tepees  --  and the time came for battle action , he froze as he had when confronted by the rattlesnake , and while those about him decimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then exterminated them in the wild follow-up , he stood transfixed at the bloody killing . ' We wiped them out ! ' the volunteers shouted as scouts advised them where to head in order to trap the next group of Kronks . Two men who had seen Yancey 's craven behavior walked with him , offering advice : When the firin ' starts , do n't listen to the noise and never look at the Indians as human bein 's . You 're shootin ' squirrels , that 's all . You 've shot squirrels , ai n't you ? ' When Yancey said he had not , the men said : Well , you 're goin ' to shoot somethin ' much better than squirrels tomorrow . You keep with us . We 'll show you . ' That night the Quimper 's Ferry people were overtaken by a late contingent from the Trinity , and foremost in that group was Reverend Harrison , who conducted services in the darkness , assuring the avengers that they were doing God 's work in removing the Indian menace from this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherever we move in Texas . And we shall enjoy no peace till we exterminate him . ' When two men from the ferry region who had not known the minister before asked : You think the battle against them will go on forever ? ' he replied : The fight for goodness never ceases . Our grandchildren will be fighting Indians . ' On the next day , at about noon , the last great battle against the Karankawa took place , and these proud Indians , for centuries the lords of the three rivers and the scourge of those lesser tribes who tried to infiltrate , realized that their sunset was upon them , and they fought with terrible valor , one brave driving alone at the heart of the white army , coming on and on until he arrived at the mouth of the guns with only a broken stave in his hand . Urrk ! Arrgh ! ' he shouted in meaningless syllables , trying to grasp with his bare hand the rifle barrels whose fiery discharges tore him apart . In terrible struggle the mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . women . . . little girls ... boys defying the rifles . A notable tribe endeavored to protect its homeland , and failed . Toward evening a pitiful remnant fighting on the far edge of the encounter rallied under the leadership of two heroic warriors to break through the encircling ranks of white men . Signaling to other survivors , women and children alike , these few started a long retreat south toward refuge across the Rio Grande , and after harrowing days without food or water they vanished , except for a few stragglers , from the soil of Texas , to be known no more except in fabled stories about them Kronks who ate people . ' They went in sorrow and defeat , the first of more than four-score Indian tribes who would be banished from Texas until the triumphant whites could boast : We ai n't got no Indians in Texas . We could n't abide ' em .

Yancey did not distinguish himself in this final battle , for , as before , the sound of gunfire immobilized him , and he could only watch as the struggle evolved . AtI one point in the battle a Karankawa dashed right past him , not fifteen feet away , and one of Yancey 's counselors bellowed : Fire , goddamnit , fire ! ' But Yancey was ( unable to do so . However , on the way home , when he marched with other men , he began to talk about his heroics among the Karankawa , so that by the time he reached the ferry he had convinced himself that he had behaved with more than average bravery , and when he was close to the family dog-run he told his companions : You know , there 's a Kronk who moves about here , now and then , ' and this sa excited the victorious Texicans that when they suddenly saw before them The Kronk , they unhesitatingly slew him , the last Karankawa the Brazos would ever see . Mattie was appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killers , they said honestly : Yance never told us he was tame , ' and she deduced the ; criminal part her son had played in this assassination . She did not chastise him for ) this terrible act , but on succeeding days as she sat on her porch at dusk , exhausted by the multiple tasks she was required to perform while Jubal was out hunting meat or searching for honey trees , she realized how severe her loss was in the death of The Kronk . He had been a member of the family , their custodian , their ' watchman , the one who stepped forward when there was work to do , the one with whom she talked when the men were away and she faced long days of work . Painfully , this savage Indian had made the transition to civilization , and in the end that civilization had destroyed him for no reason except that he was an Indian .

She wanted no more of war , no more of argument between Catholic and Protestant , no more confrontation between Mexico and the American states . She wanted only to operate her ferry , run her inn , feed the traveler , and save enough money to buy a new dress at the store in Sari Felipe or perhaps some extra forks and spoons . But most of all , she prayed in her desolation that her son would somehow otj other grow into manhood , with the capacity to meet a man 's obligations .  | No American settlers since the Revolution of 1776 had faced the nagging moral problems encountered by those citizens of the republic who moved into Texas in the period of 182o-1835 . And none faced the confusions with more vacillating reactions than Jubal Quimper . Even those later settlers who would cross an entire continent to build new homes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one part of the United States to another , they would carry their religion , their language and their customary law with them . But when people like the Quimpers emigrated to Texas they surrendered such assurances , placing themselves under the constraints of a new religion , a new language and a much different system of law . Facing these complexities , Mattie and Jubal followed one simple rule : ' Whatever Stephen F. Austin decides is probably right . ' Like many others , they revered the strange little man , forgiving him his arbitrary manner . Mattie especially realized that there was a good deal wrong with Austin : Why has he never married ? Is he afraid of women ? And why does he stare at you with those fixed eyes , like a hawk ? All he can think of is his colony . But despite his faults , and they were many , she saw him as the reliable guide , and whenever he stopped at her inn during his travels throughout the colony , she nodded approval to what he told the visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tejas will not only live under this new Mexican Constitution of 1824 ; it will prosper . ' Are n't there weaknesses in it ? ' a farmer asked , and Austin snapped : There are weaknesses in every document drawn by the human mind . Our new law has certain peculiarities reflecting Mexican custom , but they will not impinge upon our freedom . Tejas is to be a Catholic state , but we 've seen how easily we live under that constraint . And , yes , priests and soldiers will be tried in courts manned only by their own people , but that 's always been the case and we have n't suffered . ' Are you satisfied , ' a settler from Alabama asked bluntly , to live under Mexican law for the rest of your life ? ' and Austin answered : I am.

' But some days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Quimper 's Ferry , a copy of the new constitution arrived and the man from Alabama who had interrogated Austin rushed to the inn , waving the paper in the air : Good God !

' And he asked Quimper to read the offending passage : With the adoption of this constitution , slavery is forbidden throughout Tejas , and six months from this date , even the importation of slaves already on their way to Tejas will be outlawed . ' Neighbors quickly gathered , and thus began one of the insoluble contradictions of Texas history : of a hundred families like the Quimpers , not more than fifteen  | owned slaves , which meant that the vast majority could have had no financial interest in preserving slavery , yet most of those without slaves defended the institution and seemed ready to battle Saltillo to preserve it . Jubal and Mattie were representative : We never had no slaves in Tennessee and did n't know many people who did . Lord knows , we do n't have any to share our work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says right in the Bible that the sons of Ham shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water , and that 's the way it 's got to be . ' Mattie , who befriended everyone , even Karankawa , was especially strong in her , condemnation of the proposed law : Niggers ai n't really human . I do n't yearn to own none , but those good folks who bring ' em here ought to be protected in their property . ' This question so agitated the settlers that a delegation of three planters , led by Jubal Quimper , went resolutely down to Austin 's headquarters and told him bluntly : Our liberties must be preserved . ' And with that simple statement arose the tantalizing ethical issue which would plague Texas for decades , because goodhearted men like Jubal Quimper honestly believed that their freedom could be ensured only by the right to enslave others . Austin , perceiving the moral wrong in this position , laid bare his honest feelings : Gentlemen , I tell you frankly that I oppose slavery with every fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it four times . It 's bad for society in general . It 's bad for commerce . And bad for both master and slave . Never have I departed from this belief and never shall I. The wise men in Saltillo who framed our constitution knew what they were doing , and they did it well . Slavery should be outlawed . ' There could have been no statement of principle more unequivocal than that , and it persuaded Quimper , who spoke for the others : You 're right , Stephen . What we need is a whole new start . No masters . No slaves . ' But no sooner had Quimper renewed his support than an extraordinary reversal occurred , for that night Austin began to review the problem , not according to his personal convictions but according to his role as leader of a tentative colony not yet securely based , and the more he studied reality the more convinced he became that Tejas had little chance of survival if it failed to attract hundreds or even thousands of established Southern gentlemen who would bring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning he attacked the philosophical problem first . Gentlemen , order , order . I do not derogate the great states of Kentucky and Tennessee from which many of our finest settlers have come , nor do I speak against any man standing here . But I have become painfully aware that our colony can progress only if we attract in large numbers families of wealth , high cultural attainment and sound moral training from our educated Southern states like Virginia , Carolina , Georgia , Alabama and Mississippi . When they join us with  | their books , their wealth and their long experience in trade , they will make Tejas a state of which we shall be proud . ' There was a long silence while the inescapable truth of what he had said was judged , and then Quimper cried : You 're right , Stephen . We need schoolteachers and men who know the Bible . ' While many nodded and some whispered , Austin waited , almost afraid to point out the consequences of what he had just said , but finally he summoned courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bring their slaves . What white man could grow sugar cane in our steaming river bottoms ? What white man from Alabama could toil under our blazing sun chopping cotton ? Then pick it ? Then haul it to the gin ? Only Negroes can do such work , and slavery seems to be the pattern ordained by God for handling them . It is clear that Tejas must have slavery or perish . ' So Juba ( Quimper , in a committee of seven , only one of whom owned slaves , helped Austin draft an appeal to the state government in Saltillo and the national government in Mexico City , explaining that whereas the abolishment of slavery was unquestionably right for the rest of the nation , it was not appropriate , at this time , in a frontier region like Tejas : We can not work our fields without slaves , and we can not populate our empty spaces unless men of property from the Southern states of America are permitted to bring their slaves with them . ' Austin , a man who hated slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home Quimper reviewed the sudden shifts of their leader : First he was stern morality : " Slavery must be abolished . " Then he was all for the South : " They must be allowed to bring in their slaves . " I wonder where he really stands ? Matter of fact , I wonder where I stand . ' This moral confusion on the part of Austin and his adherents would continue , for when Austin concocted a dream for enticing thousands of German and Swiss settlers , he became an ardent opponent of slavery , in deference to their known dislike for keeping anyone in bondage : The possibility of ' such a country as Tejas being overrun by a slave population almost makes me weep . Slavery is an injustice and a demoralizing agent in society . When I started this colony I was forced to tolerate it for a while , because I had to draw upon the slave states for my emigrants . But slavery is now most positively prohibited by our Mexican constitution and I hope it may always be so , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst reproaches of civilized man . ' But later he would be forced once more to consider the realities of settlement , and again he would reverse himself completely :  | ' I used to oppose slavery , but during the last six months I have had to restudy the matter and now conclude that Texas must be a slave country . Circumstances and unavoidable necessity compel it . It is the wish of the people , and I shall do all I can , prudently , in favor of it . I will do so . ' Quimper , listening to this speech , noticed that Austin had dropped the Spanish Tejas in favor of the English Texas , indicating serious doubt that his colony could long remain with Mexico , which he also now pronounced in the American fashion . Never again would his friends hear him use the Spanish names which he had tried so faithfully to defend but which he now abandoned forever . Juhal 's attention to such heady political matters was diverted in late 1828 by an exciting letter from his former lawyer in Gallatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Your persecutor , Hammond Carver , was killed in a duel , and this legally terminates his case against you . I have ascertained from his survivors that they have no intention of resurrecting the suit , and they have acknowledged in writing that the contested land is yours , along with all the buildings on it . You find yourself not a rich man but one with ample fields and some money , which you can claim only by coming here in person . Do so immediately , for you and Mattie have many friends in these parts who are eager to see you resume your life among them . This heaven-sent opportunity to escape the tensions of a frontier Texas made Jubal realize how much he longed for the stability of a settled Tennessee , and he was ready to depart immediately : ' Mattie ! We 're free to go home ! ' She deflated his enthusiasm by saying with bulldog stubbornness : ' I have no wish to see Tennessee again , ' and he began placing before her all the reasons why they should return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallatin : ' Arthur says we wo n't be really rich , but we 'll have enough to buy us a couple of slaves . You wo n't have to worry about the ferry , and we wo n't have strangers traipsin ' into our home . More important , we can have real walls and windows . ' He threw at her an impressive summary of the differences between civilized Tennessee and barbarian Texas , but in the end she countered with an incontestable reply : ' I like it here . ' And in fragmentary comments she let him and Yancey know how deeply Texas had infected her : ' Nothin ' I saw in Tennessee is better than that clump of oak trees in the meadow . ' During another debate she said : ' I like the Brazos , the way it rises and falls , like it had a will of its own . ' On a different day she said : ' My heart beats faster when a stranger comes to the door at  | night , needin ' food  --  and we have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' moss , I 've allowed Texas to grow over me , and I admire the feel . ' Guarding each word , she said : ' You and Yancey can go back and settle the claim , and if you 're so minded , you can stay . I 'll give you your freedom , in the courts if you wish , but this is now my home and I expect to end my days runnin ' my ferry . ' The force of her statement made Jubal pause . Twice he started to speak but could find no words , then abruptly he turned away and went to walk beneath the oak trees that Mattie loved so deeply , and as he tried to see their new home through her eyes he began to appreciate why she loved Texas and was so unwilling to leave it . After more than an hour of walking along the Brazos he returned to his wife and took her in his arms : ' Mattie , old girl , if this is your home , it 'll be mine , too . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was you held me upright . ' She cherished his embrace but did not wish to impede him : ' If your heart 's set on Tennessee .. ' Hush ! I 'll go back , sell the land , and buy some lumber in New Orleans . I 'm goin ' to build you a proper house . ' With this commitment , from which he would never deviate , Jubal Quimper became a Texican . That day Mattie , with a song trembling on her lips , started to pack the goods her two men would require for their long trip , but her work was interrupted by Yancey , who came whispering : ' I do n't want to go . Indians and that Strip and all , ' and she could guess that what really held him back was his memory of that fistfight with the smaller boy . What will happen to him ? she asked herself . A boy who refuses a journey up the Mississippi ? She had finished packing when a cloud of dust appeared from the south ; Benito Garza was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules for the American army . He was twenty-two now , a slim , neat fellow with a small mustache , an ingratiating smile and a fair command of English : ' This time I take the mules myself . I do not need guide of trader from San Antonio . ' He had brought with him a Mexican boy , no more than fourteen , and a large remuda of some three dozen mules , which he hoped to augment as he moved north : ' I like to buy any mules you might have , Senor Quimper ? ' When Jubal said he had none , Garza asked : ' Is it true , senor ? You 're going to Tennessee ? ' ' I must . ' ' A town on the Mississippi ? ' ' It 's a state . Like Coahuila-y-Tejas . ' ' But it is on the Mississippi ? ' When Quimper nodded , the ebullient young man slapped himself on the knee and cried : ' Then you must come with us ! Save time , save money . Catch a steamboat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistons of a riverboat , spouting imaginary steam with his mouth and sounding a whistle . Mattie was enthusiastic about such a plan and tried to persuade her son ,  | now sixteen , to go along : You can help manage the mules , and you 'll see the steamboat , ' but he still refused to go , not wishing to take such risks . The two men left in October and wandered up the Goliad Road with some fifty mules , adding to them at the Trinity and then keeping to the southernmost route along the Gulf till they crossed the Sabine into Louisiana . There they found tolerable roads leading to New Orleans , where Jubal stayed in Mexican lodgings with his two companions . He told Garza as the latter dickered with the American authorities over the prices of his mules : Benito , I 'd enjoy travelin ' with you some time again . You know how to move about . ' And Garza said : You 'd be welcome . I need to practice English if so many of you are coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you . . . I 'm warnin ' you , really , Texas wo n't be Mexican forever . ' ' I think it will be , ' Garza said , and when they were back in their mean quarters he asked Quimper : How long , senor , have you been in Tejas ? ' and Quimper thought a moment , then said : Six years , ' and Garza laughed : Senor ! And you 're telling me who is to run Tejas ! My people explored Tejas three hundred years ago . ' Quimper considered this , then said with no rancor : Amigo , that may have ensured you a foothold in what you call Tejas . But in the Texas that 's comin ' you better speak like an American and think like one , or you 're goin ' to be homeless , ' and the young man snapped : Garzas will be living here when you 've run back to Tennessee . ' The only thing about Garza that Quimper did not like was this quickness at resenting whatever the young man interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're goin ' to live in a white man 's state , Benito , you must n't be so touchy . ' But I am a white man , and Tejas is my state . ' Quimper let the matter drop , for he no longer tried to understand how the Hispanic mind worked . When Quimper left the Mississippi riverboat at Memphis and started overland to Nashville , he experienced several moments of solemn discovery : Tennessee is so cramped compared to Texas . . . A man can hardly breathe , hemmed in by all these trees . He did enjoy the snug little towns and the orderly plantations manned by slaves , but repeatedly he caught himself longing for the Brazos and the great , open freedom of Texas : I 'll sell the land and get back home . He spent his first two weeks in Nashville listening to talk about those events which had occurred since his hasty departure in 1822 : We got ourself a great new governor , Sam Houston , him as fought with Andy Jackson against the Indians at Horseshoe Bend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goin ' to be President of the United States one of these days . ' Wherever he moved he heard good reports of Houston : Big man , you know .  | Brave , too . Lived among the Indians . Speaks their language , I 'm told . Taller than that post , I 'd judge . ' How did he become governor ? ' ' Oh , he was a military hero ! General Jackson thought very highly of him , and that helped him get elected to the Congress , in Washington . How many terms did he serve , Jake ? Three ? ' Two , ' Jake said . ' Could of been elected permanent , or senator , either . But we wanted him for governor , and with Andy Jackson 's help , we got him . ' Quimper had no opportunity to see Houston in Nashville , for men explained that the governor had business to the east ; ' You know , he 's standin ' for reelection this year . Foolish for anyone to run against him , most popular man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nashville for the short trip to Gallatin he had heard so much about Houston that he said , on his last night in town : ' He 's the kind of man we could use in Texas , ' but his fellow diners dismissed the idea : ' His home 's in Tennessee . Hell , he is Tennessee . ' When Quimper arrived in his old hometown of Gallatin he heard only one topic of conversation : ' Little Eliza Allen of our town ! She 's goin ' to marry the governor ! Tomorrow ! ' Since the Aliens were among the leading citizens in Gallatin , Jubal did not know them socially , but he was pleased to think that if the wedding was public , he would have a chance to see and perhaps even meet Sam Houston . The celebrations took place in January 1829 , and they were a sumptuous affair , for not often did a small town like Gallatin find one of its daughters marrying the governor of a state , a man certain to be reelected , and after a term or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency . Several score of guests rode out from Nashville and others came long distances from the eastern part of the state , where Houston had once lived . He was a rising star with whom politicians of all stripes wished to be associated , and when Quimper saw him , a giant of a man , and holding on to his arm a delicate little woman dressed in white with just a touch of pink in her ribbons , he was awed : He looks like a governor ! He looks like a Texican ! I was right when I said we could use him . When the wedding was solemnized in high form , Quimper found himself thinking : Not much like the mass unions that Father Clooney celebrates , and he felt a longing for that simpler life : I know what Mattie meant . I could n't live here in Gallatin after that free life on the rivers . But such thoughts were expelled that night when , at about ten , the men of town were nicely inebriated and someone shouted : ' Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nearly a hundred drunks assembled outside the tavern with horns and drums and washboards and bugles and tin pots . Led by one of Eliza 's cousins , the crowd surged along the streets , gathering recruits , until it reached the small house in which the governor and Eliza were spending their first night together .  | There a noise was generated which had not been matched since the explosion of a powder depot some years before . Horns blared , men bellowed , drums were banged , and the night was made raucous with a serenade whose tradition dated back two thousand years . A marriage was being launched , and the community wished to mark this mystical occasion not only with prayers but also with riotous celebration , and when two men came up with a barrel of whiskey on wheels , the noise really began . It was a shivaree honoring a great and much-loved man , a man of dignity and power , and all who shattered the night did so in hopes that somehow their destiny would be matched to his . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved , and after a while the men started a chant : Eliza ! Eliza ! The world 's fairest flower . Eliza ! Eliza ! Pray come to my bower . ' It was well after two in the morning before the barrel was empty and the tin pots beaten beyond recognition . Then off to their beds straggled the celebrants , except those who returned to the taverns , banging on the doors and demanding admittance . Quimper , remaining in the streets through the night , judged that he had never participated in a better shivaree and he doubted that anyone else had , either . A few days later , Jubal found an opportunity to talk with Houston : Governor , I 've cast my lot with Texas , and I can see that you 're the kind of man we need down there . To pull things together before we join the Union . ' Houston , afraid that this might be a trap seducing him into some impropriety , said easily : Now , sir , I can tell you that I 've always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 I applied for a land grant down there . Ca n't remember whether I ever received the papers or not , but I know it 's a splendid territory ? ' You have a dazzlin ' future , Governor , Texas or wherever . ' The big man appreciated such flattery and accepted it gracefully : ' My future 's twofold . To build a proper house for my wife and to get reelected governor of this great state . That 's enough to keep me busy . ' The next day Quimper was startled to see Governor Houston striding through town in his favorite costume : Indian garb , sandals , buckskin britches , with a bright red shawl draped about his shoulders . What 's he doin ' ? ' Jubal asked a bystander , and the man snorted : Keep watchin ' . You 'll see wonders . ' And on subsequent days Houston appeared in three radically different costumes , none appropriate to his high office . Finally Jubal had to comment : Governor , you seem to like unusual dress , ' to which Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , different colors . ' And then , on the sixteenth of April in that first year of marriage , Gallatin and all of Tennessee were stunned by the news that the delicate and lovely Eliza Allen  | Houston had for some mysterious reason never to be revealed left the governor 's bed and board , telling her family that she could never return . Impossible ! ' the men in the taverns cried , while their wives at home met secretly to explore in hushed conversation the devastating possibilities . That Eliza 's abrupt behavior must have had some dark , sexual cause , there could be no doubt , and since specifically what it had been would never be disclosed , speculation was not only invited but also inventive . The scandal was intensified when the governor announced that he must , out of respect to his constituency , refuse to stand for reelection , and when his friends implored him not to take such drastic action , he shocked them completely by resigning the balance of the term to which he was already entitled . While they fumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Indians he had known previously . Rarely in American history had a man who had risen so high fallen so low . His precipitate departure raised far more questions than it answered , for in the silence surrounding the case his partisans launched an explanation , totally unauthorized , which cleared his name . But this could be circulated only at the expense of Eliza Allen , whose irate family had no intention of allowing her to shoulder the blame for this destruction of Houston 's career , so in self-defense the male members of the Allen family engineered a solution unique in American political life . They nominated a panel of twelve sober citizens of impeccable repute to hold a series of public meetings , the more salacious details kept private , to apportion blame in this affair . At the conclusion a vote would be taken and a determination made as to whether Eliza Allen , of Gallatin , was or was not guilty in even the slightest degree in the scandalous affair of Governor Sam Houston . When eleven solons had been selected  --  military heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a relative of the abused wife , suggested : I 'm glad to see this fellow Quimper back among us . He 's become a man of sober judgment , reputation restored by the courts . I 'd like to see him stay here . Let 's signify our acceptance by inviting him to serve on our jury . ' No member of the committee listened to the evidence with closer attention than Quimper , and when the time came for the first crucial vote , he experienced no uncertainty . The question was clearly stated : Was Eliza Allen , at the time of her marriage to Governor Houston , a virgin ? ' The vote was eleven-to-one affirmative , and as soon as the man who voted nay was known , one of the colonels challenged him to a duel on the grounds that he had impugned the reputation of a gentlewoman , but the voter justified himself by explaining that he was a lawyer from Virginia who felt that the question as stated could not be answered , since substantive evidence had not been provided . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ashen-faced Virginian , aware of how close he had come to being shot ,  | begged permission to alter his vote to affirmative , and when the balloting was announced , Eliza was unanimously found to have been a virgin . Each of the other possible charges against her was analyzed similarly , and in vote after vote the correctness of her behavior was sustained . When the final tally was made , it was clear that Eliza 's reputation had been not only cleared but also burnished ; by the twelve ablest men in Gallatin she was found to have been immaculate in both behavior and spirit . At the conclusion of the investigation two members of the panel composed a stirring document in which Eliza 's purity was extolled and the governor 's lack of it deplored ; it covered all the debatable points and indicated the jury 's vote on each , and it ended with an exhortation to the journals of Tennessee and surrounding states that they give the fullest possible coverage to the voting . But the Virginia lawyer , already frightened by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now advised the committee that whereas the report accurately summarized their debate , and while its decisions were irrefutable , it might be wise to delay publication until the jury could be sure that Sam Houston had left the state . After prudent delay the report was circulated , and interested newspapers did publish it , but by then Houston was lost in the wilds of Arkansas , living among ' his beloved Indians and remaining drunk most of the time . A traveler told ; + . Quimper : Shortly after Houston arrived in Arkansas , I saw him drunk in a saloon , where a local braggart challenged him to a duel . I was standin ' with Houston when he accepted . Asked me to be his second , so in the mornin ' haze , lengths were stepped off . The two duelists , obviously unsteady , marched , turned , aimed and fired . Nobody got hit for the good reason that me and the other man 's second , realizin ' that our men were drunk and without any sensible basis for a duel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jubal was still chuckling over this portrait of the former governor , he was confronted by a great temptation . Leonidas Allen , the man who had sponsored his membership on the Houston jury , invited him twice to dinner in the Aliens ' spacious mansion , and only the most attractive Southern hospitality prevailed , but on a third visit Leonidas took Jubal aside and said in a low voice : Surely you 've noticed that my older sister , Clara , is quite taken with you . ' Jubal had not noticed , but when he returned to the company of the ladies he i could not avoid Clara 's ardent glances . As he left the mansion , Leonidas whispered : ' We would be most honored , Clara and me , that is , if you 'd dine with us tomorrow . ' ' Sir , I 'm married . I have a wife in Texas . ' Things can always be arranged ' He spent a feverish night , for with the funds he had received from the settlement , plus those which would accrue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all repulsive , he could own one of the Gallatin mansions . Also , he could  | hear Mattie saying : I 'll give you your freedom . ' But as he tossed on his straw mattress he thought of the Brazos , and Stephen Austin trying to build a state , and of Texas reaching empty to the horizon , and of Mattie poling her ferry . Early next morning he went to a bank , arranged for his new wealth to be posted to a New Orleans agent against whom he could draw when he returned home , and headed for the Mississippi without bidding either Leonidas or Clara farewell . When his boat put in to an Arkansas levee , one of the hands cried : There comes Sam Houston . Meets us every trip . ' And up the gangway came the former governor , already drunk but looking to the steamboat 's bar for replenishment . Jubal , fearing that Houston might have learned about the jury report , hid among the passengers but stayed close enough to hear Houston haranguing the travelers : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to Oregon . I 'm goin ' there as soon as practical . ' When Houston was safely off the boat and lying immobile beside some cotton bales , Jubal said to a passenger : Look at him ! Governor of a state ! We do n't need his kind in Texas . ' New Orleans , Nachitoches in Louisiana , Nacogdoches in Texas , El Camino Real and south along the banks of the Trinity to the Goliad Road , this was the pathway of empire , except that other things besides immigrants traveled it . This autumn , cholera made the journey too , meeting up with Jubal Quimper just before he reached the village on the Trinity in which Reverend Harrison hid and from which he conducted his forbidden prayer meetings . The two men were glad to see each other , and Harrison sat fascinated as Jubal reported upon the doings in Tennessee ; it was Harrison 's opinion , delivered from afar , that Governor Houston , a giant of a man , as Quimper reported , must have outraged his gentle wife in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved . You did the work of the Lord . ' On the second day of the visit , Quimper fell into a fit of such violent shaking that the preacher cried : Dear God , Jubal , you must have the plague ! ' And as soon as these dire words were spoken they were flashed throughout the small community , and the minister 's house was quarantined . It was a useless gesture , because by that night four other cases of extreme ague had been identified , and by morning it was clear that the Trinity River had received from some mysterious source , perhaps from Jubal Quimper himself via New Orleans , its latest attack of this dread disease . Called alternately the plague , or cholera , or the vomiting shakes , or simply the fever , it assaulted the human body so furiously and with such total destruction that the victim rarely survived three full days , and that was the case with Quimper . Reverend Harrison , ignoring the pleas of his secret parishioners that he dissociate himself from the stricken man , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can medicine Quimper , ' and he remained with Jubal , cooling his fevered face with damp towels until convulsive seizures showed that death was imminent . Beloved brother in Christ , Jesus awaits thee in heaven . May the merciful God stay this plague and may the earth be made whole again . ' In the last minutes he bathed the dying man 's face once more , praying frantically , as if to finish his beseeching before his friend died : Dear God , take into Your bosom this traveler . On earth he tried to do Your bidding . In heaven he will grace Your throne . ' When Quimper died , Harrison closed the eyelids and arranged the sweatdrenched bedclothes . Then he left his house , but others in the village were afraid to move near him . Quimper 's clothes had to be burned , of course , but a few durable possessions like coins remained , and these the minister gathered , proposing to carry them the sixty miles to Quimper 's Ferry , for he felt that it would be improper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers . He was delayed , however , by the necessity of burying four others who had fallen to the plague , and when this was finished he wondered whether it was proper for him to move into another community , lest he carry the cholera with him . Waiting six days , he concluded that he was not going to be stricken , so down the Goliad Road he went on his mission of compassion . As he neared the ferry he wondered how he should speak to Mattie , for her husband had been far too young to die , but even when he stood at the pole that carried the flag travelers were instructed by a signboard to raise if they wanted the ferry to fetch them , he was undecided . He heard young Yancey shouting : Mom ! The ferry ! ' and he wondered why this growing boy did not himself come across to get him , but since Yancey did not , Mattie appeared , wiping her hands on her apron and heading for the heavy pole . With the skill acquired from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouted : Welcome , Pastor ! Jubal will be coming home any time now . ' When he climbed into the ferry he sat silent for so long that Made asked abruptly : What is it , Reverend ? Bad news ? ' and he said simply : Jubal died . Cholera . ' She did not interrupt her poling . Pushing the heavy post into the bottom mud , she walked along the edge of her craft , shoving the ferry forward , then dragging the pole in the water as she strode forward to push once more . Working and keeping her eyes upon the swirling water , she said nothing till she brought her craft home safely to its resting place . Then , helping the minister to negotiate the steep bank , she said : Father Clooney 's here . Six weddings set for this afternoon . ' They walked to the dog-run , where the priest was sitting in the shade at the far end of the porch . Hello , Reverend , ' he said , and Harrison replied : I bring heavy news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Clooney had helped bury many plague victims , but never could he adjust to the incredible swiftness with which this terrible malady struck , and to have it take a man to whom he , Clooney , was so much indebted was a burden trebly heavy . Let us not tell the others , ' he suggested . It 's their wedding . ' So the three agreed that not even Yancey would be told until after the ceremony . I 'll move along , ' Harrison said . I could n't attend the wedding . ' You could if you wished , ' Father Clooney said . He wanted to add , so that Harrison would join , that such weddings were formalities demanded by the Mexican government , but he could not frame the words . No wedding was a formality , not any , not under any conceivable circumstances . Harrison , unwilling to participate in or bear witness to such an improper mixture of politics and faith , moved sullenly away , but Clooney , on the other hand , became more excited and devout as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to encourage himself , he was feeling at the height of his power by the time the six couples had gathered , and he surprised them by saying with deep solemnity : Let us gather at the river , ' and he led them to a plateau adorned by oak trees where the couples could look down forty feet to the Brazos as it carried mud to the sea . He had not chosen this spot by accident , for when the farmers stood with their brides and their children , he cried in a kind of chant : When storms strike far inland , that little stream down there can rise in fury and sweep across this land which seems so safe up here . Forty feet of sudden turbulence , and who can believe that ? It will be the same with your marriages , an unexpected storm can overwhelm you , and who would believe that ? Wise men and women , when they enter into marriage , do so with some religious blessing , with God 's most precious sanction , for they know they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not protect their homes up here , the stormy river would sweep them away . And if you do not call upon God to consecrate your marriages , they too can be swept away . In this solemn moment when you start your new lives I give you the balm of God 's love . I anoint you . I bless you . I give you the gentle kiss of Jesus . Above all , I give you protection against the great storms of life . In life and in death ... ' Here he chanced to look across the fields to the house so recently struck by untimely death , and his throat began to close up and his eyes to fill with tears . He lost track of what he was saying and almost began to blubber , so great was his anguish over the fate of Mattie Quimper , and he became so incoherent that the  | wiser men among the grooms winked at one another : The old man 's drunk again . ' He was n't , not then , but when he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , he did start to drink heavily , so that when Reverend Harrison returned , eligible to rejoin them now that the Romish ceremony was ended , Clooncy was ready to embrace him as a brother : Harrison , we must both give consolation to this good Christian woman . ' As evening approached he became quite drunk , and at one point he said to Harrison , as if he had never seen him before : ' Me name 's Father Clooney , of Ballyclooney on Clooney Bay , in County Clare , ' but when the stiff Protestant ignored him , he realized his foolishness and said hastily : ' You 're Reverend Harrison ! You and I must look after Yancey now . He 'll need a father , ' and he began calling : Yancey , Yancey ! ' When there was no answer , he looked hazily at Harrison , lay down upon the porch , and passed easily into a deep sleep that would last through the night . God blessed me in one thing , ' Mattie said as darkness fell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That one down there . Stephen Austin . And Jubal . Many women never know none . ' Harrison said boldly : You must take a new husband , Mattie . You 'll need help to run the inn and the ferry . ' At this moment , on the far shore , a late traveler hallooed : Can you fetch me ? I have no food , no blankets . ' She left the porch , went down to the Brazos , and poled sturdily across the narrow river to where the pilgrim waited . When the boat was loaded she shoved off , and in the moonlight brought him to the warmth of her inn . TASK FORCE We experienced the first open break in our Task Force when we met in October 1983 to plan our impending meeting in Tyler , where the topic was to be Religion in Texas . ' We found it difficult to agree upon an appropriate speaker , for although none of us had strong convictions regarding specific theologies , and certainly we did not want to intrude on clerical matters , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming Texas attitudes . But we did not know whom to invite , and because there were differences among us we postponed our meeting till November . The blowup involved not religion but the successful American invasion of the little Caribbean island of Grenada . Rusk and Quimper , as gung-ho Texans , ap-  | plauded the action . We should of done it years ago , ' Quimper said . And since we have a running start , let 's move on to Nicaragua and Cuba . ' Miss Cobb , descendant of Democratic senators , voiced a much different view : President Reagan , having seen how much the invasion of the Falklands helped Maggie Thatcher win reelection in Great Britain , is pulling the same trick in the United States . ' And succeeding , ' Rusk snapped , and she agreed : He is . Brilliantly . If the election were held tomorrow , he 'd win in a landslide . America does love its successful little wars , but tires quickly of its big unsuccessful ones . ' That 's communist talk , ' Rusk said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to show it , or they do n't believe you have it . ' Dr. Garza tried to slow down the animosities by advancing a more sober theory : America must proceed very carefully . In every Latin country there 's latent memory of Marines invading at will . If we run rampant in the Caribbean , we 'll engender a profound revulsion . We must go slow . ' Rusk spoke like a letter-to-the-editor of a Texas newspaper when he said : We should n't give a damn what they think about us . We should discipline Cuba , right now . And if Nicaragua is in the Cuban camp , we should knock it out too . We 've had enough liberal shilly-shallying . ' Do you want to nuke Nicaragua ? ' Miss Cobb asked , and Rusk replied : If necessary , ' to which Garza asked : And risk Armageddon ? ' With the battle lines thus firmly drawn  --  Rusk and Quimper versus Cobb and Garza  --  the members looked to me , and I could not escape revealing my opinion : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invasion of Grenada was justified . I think it forestalled Cuban action . And I 'm sure it 's reelected Ronald Reagan . ' Miss Cobb was disappointed with me : Do you know how big Grenada is ? Smaller than the tiniest Texas county . Does America gain glory by subduing such a target ? ' Wake Island was lots smaller , ' I retorted quickly , and we gained a lot of glory there . You excise a cancer when it 's small , or you lose a life . ' Garza groaned at this forced analogy , and there would have been further debate had not our staff insisted that we reach a decision concerning the program for our meeting on religion , so we turned from one heated battleground to another . Dr. Garza suggested a professor from a Catholic college in New Mexico , believing that this would provide continuity from the very first days to the present , but Quimper objected vigorously , and with reason : I thought we settled that at our El Paso meeting . No more Catholics . Texas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants . ' You 're right , ' Garza conceded with no rancor . I was just trying to advance the interests of my boys . '  | Do n't blame you , ' Rusk interrupted . But now I want to advance the interests of my boys . My grandparents were Quaker and Baptist . Very few Quakers in , Texas , thank God , because the two religions ? ' What two religions ? ' Miss Cobb interrupted . Quaker and Texas , they do n't mix . I recommend we invite a Baptist minister . ' Now wait , Rance , ' Quimper protested . Texas was settled primarily by Methodists . And I 'd like to hear an honest Methodist interpretation . ' After the two men wrestled over this without reaching a solution , Rusk asked : Loren , what are you ? ' and Miss Cobb said : What the Southern gentlefolk always were , Episcopalian , but in Texas we 've carried little weight . ' The four now turned to me , and Quimper asked : Barlow , you 've never said what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutheran , ' and they all asked : What 's that ? ' and I explained : When I taught school in a small town in the Panhandle the board was very nosy about their teachers ' religion , and my crusty old principal told me : " Tell ' em you 're a Home Lutheran . Very devout , but you conduct your services in the privacy of your home . " I did , and got away with it . ' Rusk took me up on this : Since we ca n't agree among the four of us , and since Texas has almost no Home Lutherans , whom would you suggest ? ' After making a chain of phone calls I came up with an almost perfect solution , and at our November meeting in Tyler , where a few late roses were still in bloom , I presented him , a tall , thin man in his fifties , wise of countenance and witty of eye . He looked like a clergyman , even in mufti , for you could see that he had been trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with effective gestures . What was equally important to our purpose , for he was to outline a weighty and sometimes contentious topic , he had a sense of humor . I allowed him to introduce himself , which he did gracefully : I 'm an ordained minister , professor in the Bible department , Abilene Christian College . The Roman numerals after my name indicate how many generations of my family have served in Texas . I 'm Joel Job Harrison VI . ' He asked our forbearance as he explained the religious history of his family , for he said that if we understood it , we would better appreciate the religious tempests which had from time to time swept Texas : ' The first Joel Job Harrison came to the Trinity River in the early t82os , as a secret Methodist circuit rider sent down to infiltrate Catholic Mexico . Devout religionists in Kentucky gave him explicit instructions : " Combat the papists . " He seems to have been a violent defender of his faith , conducting secret meetings up and down the rivers , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open warfare against Santa Anna . Faithful to his own preachings , he led one of the critical charges at San Jacinto , then roamed across Texas during the republic , building the Methodist churches that had not been permitted under Mexican rule . He was not a likable man , if we can believe the diarists of that time , for some of  | them dismiss him with contempt . But he was a warrior , and Texas Methodism owes him many debts . Joel Job III was one of those titanic clergymen who sweep across Texas from time to time . Reading his Bible one day , he made the discovery that projected him into endless battles against the Baptists , the Presbyterians and all other infidel sects . It was a curious thing . He came to believe that whereas John the Baptist had clearly baptized Jesus Christ in the Jordan River by a process which could only be called total immersion , so that there was Biblical justification for the rite as performed by the Baptists , there was no holy obligation to keep on using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned sermons against the Baptists , and especially against the sect called the Campbellites . Well , the Baptists were n't going to sit by and allow this to happen , so they threw three of their ablest men against him , one after another , and great public debates were held across North Texas . A tent would be raised or a building rented , and J. J. Harrison III , in heavy black suit and red string tie , his white hair flowing , would take on the current Baptist champion . For five successive days they would debate each afternoon , two o'clock to five , and thousands would lean forward to catch their words . Joel Job III had a majestic voice , a gift for scorn and an unrelenting sense for the theological jugular ; both he and his adversary believed they were fighting for immortal souls . Their debates became famous , and the men were fondly referred to as " our peerless ecclesiastical pugilists . " You can find in old bookstores printed versions of their battles : " The Harrison-Brand Debates , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debates . " Harrison 's name always came first because he was the more famous arguer and the one who attracted the crowds , but he confessed in a letter to a fellow Methodist clergyman : ' I always felt that I had defended Our Cause ably , but I rarely felt that I had won , because those Baptists threw against me some of the most tenacious debaters I had ever faced . They were men of learning , devotion and infinite skill in the nasty tricks of argument . ' Lanning Harper was the ablest man I ever battled , and in our four series in 1890 to 1893 , I fear that he bested me on several occasions . Looking back on those days , I think of him as a Lion of Judah and I would not care to face him again tomorrow . He had a wry sense of humor , and several times , after we had lambasted each other on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday , we would unite on Thursday against the Presbyterians , whose doctrine of fatal predestination we simply could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which summarized our contempt . I can still hear the audiences laughing when he recited :  | We are the sweet selected few , The rest of you be damned ; There 's room enough in hell for you , We do n't want heaven crammed . ' He was smiling as he finished these lines , but abruptly he turned grave , for now he must share with us a somber incident in his family history , one which produced both anguish and theological glory : Throughout the lives of I , II and III , my ancestors were aware , vaguely at times , of a powerful , primitive force gathering strength on the horizon . It centered upon a man named Alexander Campbell , born a good Presbyterian in County Antrim , Ireland , in 1788 . The birth of a child forced Campbell to decide what he thought about baptism , and the more he studied the Bible the more convinced he became that Presbyterians were out of step with the New Testament when they merely sprinkled a baby and called that baptism , while the Baptists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal of his time , he left the Presbyterians with loud renunciation and became a Baptist . He did n't stay long , for although he granted that his new church was right on baptism , he found it wrong on almost everything else , He especially rejected the vainglorious church structure it had erected to govern what in Christ 's day had been free , individual churches , each master of its own destiny . Fulminating against synods , regional associations and presbyteries , he was extremely harsh on professional clergymen who set themselves above ordinary laymen . " Protestant priests , " he called them scornfully . In every aspect of religious life Campbell yearned to get back to the simplicity of that first glorious century of the Christian era . His theories swept across the American South like a firestorm , with converts announcing themselves as Campbellites . And from what established churches did these converts come ? From the Methodists and Baptists . The infection grew malignant , with entire congregations quitti g the known churches and moving en masse into Campbell 's arms . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m t be done to stanch this hemorrhaging , so during the great debates , aft r lambasting the Presbyterians on Thursday , he and his Baptist adversa would unite on Friday to excoriate the Campbellites , who did not li that pejorative name . They called themselves the Churches in Christ , f they believed that they preserved the simplicity that Jesus would hav  | approved . I have ' several pamphlets which preserve Joel Job 's attacks on the Campbellites , and they are rather sulphurous . Again and again he warned : " Do not lure good Methodists into your infamous trap . " ' Our speaker paused to reflect upon those tempestuous days , then squared his shoulders and revealed an astonishing fact : In 1894 the religious world of Texas was shocked when this tower of Methodism , this peerless debater , went into seclusion , studied his Bible , and emerged with a startling revelation : " I can no longer support the Methodist church as it now exists . I am departing from it to become a minister in the Church of Christ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect joining forces with his ancient foes , the Campbellites , against whom he had so furiously inveighed . ' Harrison shook his head , even now startled by his ancestor 's apostasy , but then he smiled like a little boy : I warned you that we took religion seriously , and as you might expect , in his new reincarnation Joel Job III became a conservative terror . Apparently he hungered for a simpler , stabler form of worship , so before six months had passed he found himself joyously in the middle of the great fight which tore his new religion apart . You may smile when I tell you what four innovations he fought against . Missionary societies and organizations , because they were not specifically designated in the Bible . Sunday School , because he could find no justification in the Bible . Rebaptism of Baptists , Methodists and Presbyterians who wanted to join the new church : " If one baptism was good enough for John and Jesus , it 's good enough for Farmer Jones of Waco . " And his most violent hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find it mentioned as such in the New Testament . He particularly despised organs , which he felt to be an ltalian-French contamination and therefore probably Catholic . Have you ever read an account of what happened when he learned that members of his own congregation had collected funds for the purchase of an organ ? He found that they had got the money by conducting an entertainment of singing at which punch was served . The punch contained no alcohol , but when he shouted about it from his pulpit you 'd have thought it was hundred-and-fiftyproof rum . When the organ was brought within the church , he threatened to burn the place down , and was halted only by the liberals , who threw eggs at him while ewspaper reporters watched . ' Our speaker shivered , recalling the shock of those fevered days , but soon the nevitable smile returned : As you probably know , I am myself Church of Christ nd happy with the way my ecclesiastical life has developed . Believe me , I burn no churches . ' Would you object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbellite ? ' and  | he replied : ' Yes , I would . My church is much bigger in concept than the doctrine of one man . Why not just call me a Christian ? ' He waved his hands as if to brush away the great schism of which Joel Job III had been so conspicuous a part . ' With his son , J.J. IV , our family got involved in Prohibition , which racked Texas politics . He stormed the state with his old Methodist evangelism resurgent . He gloried in hauling onto his stage mothers and children made destitute by the drunkenness of their men , and if some sad bank teller absconded with three thousand dollars , he trumpeted the case in forty counties , proving that alcohol had done the man in . He smashed his way into saloons , offered to wrestle peddlers of booze , and harried Texas into voting for Prohibition . On the day it became national law he cried at a great mass meeting in Dallas : " The soul of America has been saved . " ' Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sheriffs as they raided speakeasies and testifying in court repeatedly . Those favoring the free movement of contraband up from Mexico or down from Oklahoma said of my grandfather . " Nothing wrong with Joel Job IV that a couple of cold beers would n't fix , " but he attained his greatest fame , and I think power , in the election of 1928 when he opposed the candidacy of Al Smith , partly because Smith was Catholic but even more because Al favored demon rum . ' When Smith was nominated in Houston my grandfather shouted from a dozen pulpits : " Darkest day in Texas history . Defames the sacred memory of the Alamo . " And from that moment on he toured the state relentlessly , preaching against Smith and the Democrats who proposed to lead the nation astray . Like all Harrisons , Number IV was a Democrat , but Al Smith was more than he could stomach , and after the votes were counted , the Republican National Committee sent him a telegram of gratitude for having moved Texas into their column : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire nation . " Grandfather believed this , and one of my earliest memories is watching as he took this telegram from his portfolio to let me read it . Tears streamed down his face as he said : " In 1928 we fought the good fight . But in 1932 the forces of evil struck back . " He was speaking of repeal . He died believing that America was sliding to perdition because of its tolerance of drink . ' Quimper , a heavy drinker , interrupted : ' But , Reverend Harrison , did n't you recently lead the fight against alcohol ? In those three western counties which held ; a referendum on saloons ? ' ' I did , and I 'm proud to say we kept those counties dry . I consider alcohol an abiding evil . ' ' Thank you , ' Quimper said , bowing as if to a debating adversary . Then Harrison said : ' I share these things with you to remind you that in Texas , we take religion seriously . It can even be , as I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . ' He then launched into his formal paper , which I shall summarize in his words :  | Except during the republic , when secularism ran rampant , religion has always been a major force in Texas life , and often the major force . No state in the Union pays greater deference to religion or supports it more vigorously . The founding fathers were unequivocal . Stephen F. Austin sought for his colony only devout Christians . Even a somewhat suspect hero like William Travis of Alamo fame , who dealt in slaves and deserted his family , could in 1835 write to the leaders of his church : We are very destitute of religious instruction in this extensive fine country . . . About five educated and talented young preachers would find employment in Texas , and no doubt would produce much good in this benighted land . Texas is composed of the shrewdest and most intelligent population of any new country on earth , therefore a preacher to do good must be respectable and talented . Remember Texas . Texas became a state partly because loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism or any established church as the state religion , and much of the animosity anglos in the new nation of Texas felt toward their Mexican citizens along the border stemmed from the fact that those loyal Catholics adhered to you less traditionally devout members of this Task Force can not comprehend how embittered we Protestants can become when we hear that churches along the border permit the drinking of alcohol and the gambling of Bingo on church property . We can not understand such profanation . The religious impulse influences Texas life at every level and in the most unexpected ways . To this day it keeps most stores closed on Sunday . It determined that Texas would lead the nation in the fight for Prohibition . It dominates school boards . It accounts for great universities like Southern Methodist , which Joel Job III helped found , and Texas Christian and Abilene Christian , which J.J. V was so instrumental in financing . In today 's world it explains why so many radio and television stations allocate much of their time to media ministers , who collect more funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one studied only the outward manifestations of religion , one would justified in concluding that Texas is now and always has been the most Christi n of nations , and it is understandable that many Texans , and perhaps most , lieve this to be the case . We love our churches and defend them vociferously . But if one steps back dispassionately and assesses with cold eye the actual nditions in Texas , one must wonder how deep this religious conviction runs . You are more likely to be murdered in Odessa than in any other city in the nation . It and Grand Forks , North Dakota , are of comparable size , but Odessa produces twenty-nine point eight murders per thousand ; Grand Forks , one . Dallas gunmen  | shoot more police officers in a year than do the citizens of Philadelphia , Detroit , San Diego , Phoenix , Baltimore , St. Louis , San Francisco and Boston combined . Such amazing figures can be explained only by some inherent Texas differential . Our state officials go regularly to jail for blatant offenses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South Dakota . Each autumn three or four Texas high schools watch their football teams forfeit all their games because they broke the rules , knowingly . Deaths on Texas highways from drunk driving are shattering in their regularity . And one has to be amused at the famous bass-fishing contest held at the Lake 0 ' The Pines near Jefferson . " Total prize money , one hundred and five thousand dollars . Created an open scandal because Texas sportsmen were caught fastening onto their hooks twelve-pound frozen bass flown down from Minnesota , allowing them to thaw in the warm water , then reeling them in with delighted cries : " Hey ! Look what I caught ! " When this was detected , other contestants hired scuba divers to swim to the bottom with live bass from Wisconsin to fix to their lines . Solution ? Give every fisherman a lie-detector test . When sixty percent of the winners failed , loyal Texans cried : " Understandable . They were all from Oklahoma . " Historically , Texas Christians , good church members all , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Joel Job I was a stout defender of slavery , and both Harrison II and III leaped into Confederate uniform during the War Between the States to serve as chaplains , for they believed that slavery was ordained by God and must be prolonged . Harrison IV , who led the fight against drink and Al Smith , also led the fight for the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and preached two notable sermons explaining why it was doing God 's work in Texas . ' At this point he coughed , rather nervously I thought , and fumbled among his papers for a small document , whose nature I could not determine from where I sat , before continuing : Nothing exemplifies better the complexities of the moral order in Texas than this well-edited little publication : The Blue Book for Visitors , Tourists and Those Seeking a Good Time While in San Antonio , Texas , 1911-1912 . It defines the red-light district , Via Dolorosa to Matamoras , and lists the more luxurious houses of prostitution therein . Lillian Revere seems to have run an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Phone:1888 , Private Phone:2o56 . To get there , her advertisement said , you took the San Fernandd streetcar , got off at South Pecos and Matamoras , and there you were . The boo divides the women into three classes  --  twenty-two A 's , twenty B 's , sixty-two C ' and gives addresses and phone numbers . It also lists thirty-three cabdrivers wh can be trusted . Among the names , several attract attention . Beatrice Benedict , Class A , apparently ran three houses , but how she did this is not explained . One of the Class B girls was named El Toro , one of the Class C 's was Japanese . One of the cabdrivers was John Ashton ( English Jack ) . And on page seventeen is some-  | thing I rather liked , the complete baseball schedule for San Antonio 's games in the Texas League . ' Reverend Harrison told us that he had often pondered these apparent contradictions and had decided that they did not really represent moral confusion : The Texan who guns down his neighbor does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling an argument within the accepted Texas tradition . The Texas billionaire who has three wives , three households and three families of children at the same time can not conceive of himself as doing anything wrong . He is merely perpetuating the free life of the frontier , and he sees himself as being a better Texan for so doing . With no apologies he supports his church , helping to finance its attack on immorality and loose living . Every example of social disorganization which the Northern critic might cite in an attack upon Texas can be explained away by the Texan apologist with the statement : " But that 's the way we 've always done it in Texas . " If any item of behavior is accepted by the majority , then it becomes part of the Texas theology , serving as its own justification . The good people who published The Blue Book were satisfied that they were providing a constructive service . In no instance is this more clearly demonstrated than in the case of wetbacks along the Rio Grande . For generations , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people under living conditions which were appalling at best and tragic at worst . Good church members who sent their sons and daughters to SMU or TCU saw nothing wrong in treating their Mexican workers worse than they did their animals , and their justification was : " They 're better off here than they would be back in Saltillo . " In the early 19oos the fiery Baptist minister John Franklyn Norris led a noisy crusade against horse racing , gambling and alcohol . Distressed by the perfidy of women , he launched fevered sermons against short skirts , bobbed hair and dancing . But his fiercest ire was reserved for any professors at Baylor , the Baptist university , who veered even one inch from what he felt was the literal truth of the Bible , and he succeeded in getting several fired . Idolized by Texans as their revealed prophet , he startled some of his weak-kneed supporters in 1926 by winning an argument with a gentleman and winning it by the simple expedient of whipping out a revolver and shooting the man dead with three well-placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , that he was a metber of the cloth , and therefore incapable of doing wrong . +How tragic these Texas religious debates could become was illustrated in the ca a of W. C. Brann , the Voltaire of Waco , who in the 189os published a famous muckraking journal , The Iconoclast , which delighted in castigating Baptist for their spiritual and moral deficiencies . Unable to bear his gibes , which circulated about the world , religious fanatics took stern measures : once they thrashed him in p lie ; then they kidnapped him ; they came close to lynching him ; and finally  | they killed him with a shot in the back , " right where the suspenders crossed , " and later they desecrated his grave . The contradictions have survived into our time , for recently Brother Lester Roloff , another powerful evangelist , ran children 's homes in the Corpus Christi area which broke every rule in the book , yet the state excused him on the grounds that he was a God-fearing clergyman and therefore exempt from normal re straints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our report ? ' Miss Cobb asked , and Joel Job VI was prompt in his response : That Texas really is a state which honors religion far more than most . Basic to everything we do is a reverence for religion , but we insist upon constructing our own theology . '  | O F THE VARIOUS NATIONAL GROUPS THAT SETTLED IN TEXAS , AND THERE WERE more than twenty  --  Germans , Czechs , Poles , Wends  --  the one which gave the area its basic character came from Ireland . They arrived in great numbers , filtering down the famed Natchez Trace from Pennsylvania , Ohio , Kentucky and Tennessee . They were a resolute , courageous , self-driven , arrogant lot . Often surprisingly well educated , the vast majority had been raised as Presbyterians , although many in recent years had become Methodists or Baptists . To appreciate their unique qualities , it will be instructive to follow one stubborn fellow as he makes his way slowly , accidentally toward Texas . To do this it will be necessary to jump backward in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful glen that ran west to east at the center of Scotland . At its far end , Glen Lyon was marked by a small mountain-girt loch , from which tumbled a sparkling river that bred trout and provided water for the sturdy Highland cattle grazing along its banks . On the shore of the loch , so positioned that a man could survey the protecting mountains and also see any enemies who might be climbing the glen , stood a dwelling , low and dark , of but three rooms . Its foundation was of solid boulders ; its sides were of heavy half-worked stone ; and its thatch-and-turf roof was held down by a network of thick heather ropes from whose ends dangled large rocks to offset the lifting power of the winds which often howled down the mountains . This dwelling , Dunessan by name , was occupied by the family of a redoubtable man in his seventies whose forebears generations earlier had fled into the remote fastnesses of Glen Lyon after being harried and driven from their ancestral lands . A stubborn clan , they had persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty . The old man was Macnab of Dunessan , patriarchal head of the local branch of the Macnabs , one of the most contentious clans in Scotland . He was a big man , veteran of a dozen Highland battles , and he looked especially formidable when c13d in the crimson-green-red tartan of the Macnabs , with dirk and claymore at thr ready . He wore white mutton-chop whiskers and a Highland bonnet , and named always ready to take up arms for some new battlefield , but recently an old bullet wound in his left leg had begun to impede him , forcing him to stay close to his house , from which he still roared orders to his kinsmen .  | On this morning he was in a gentler mood , for he rested with his grandson Finlay on a wooden bench outside the door , trying to catch whatever heat the wintry sun provided . Have you ever wondered , ' he asked the boy , why we Macnabs always cling to the Macdonalds and guard against the treacherous Campbells ? ' Glencoe , ' the lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , only ten years old , displayed an imperfect understanding of that tragic name , the old man drew him closer : In the long run of human history no event surpasses the villainy of the Campbells at Glencoe : And he proceeded to , summarize that Highland horror in which the Campbells , seeking to curry favor with an English king , insinuated themselves into the good graces of the rebellious Macdonalds . Appearing suddenly in the remote and gloomy fastness of Glencoe , they passed themselves off as friendly travelers , but after more than a week of feasting and singing and wooing the Macdonald lassies , the Campbells , in dead of night , fell upon their hosts and slaughtered them . It was n't the killing , mind you , ' the old man said , his hands trembling with , rage as he recalled this ancient wrong . Our glens have seen murder before . It was the perfidy . To sup with a man for ten days in a row , and on the eleventh , when your belly is filled with his bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befouling his ' own home .. Why did n't the Macdonalds fight back ? ' young Finlay asked . Those trapped in their own homes had no chance . But those clans outside who ; pertain to the Macdonalds have never stopped seeking revenge . ' Taking his grandson 's hands , he said solemnly : Laddie , wherever , whenever you meet a Campbell expect treachery . Never forget that your father died fighting them . ' The next two years in Glen Lyon were marked by the arrival of a tall , gawky man who intended to bring piety and learning to this embattled area . He was Ninian Gow , Master of Arts from the University of St. Andrews in eastern Scotland and ordained as a minister in the Presbyterian church founded by John Knox . He was deep-visaged and had large dark hairs which grew out from his Adam 's apple and moved in the air when he preached ; he was incontestably a man of God and a fearless champion of decency . He loved his church and had made great sacrifices to serve it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were that Scotland could not be truly saved until its young peop boys and girls alike , learned to read , and that it was doomed unless it combat d the evils of popery . The Campbells are Catholics , you know , ' he roared during his first sermon the glen . The glorious Reformation which brought us the true religion , Presbyt rianism in its moral grandeur , never reached the blighted glens in which t  | craven Campbells lurked . They remained unconverted , as they do to this day , ensnared in the web of popery . ' At this point he halted his sermon and stared out at the small gathering of Macnabs and Macdonalds , asking finally in a hushed voice : ' Is it any wonder that they saw no evil in worming their way into the affections of the Macdonalds and then slaughtering them ? ' Silence filled the tiny kirk , broken only by Gow 's deep voice crying : ' Let us pray . ' This was an ominous invitation , for a prayer by Ninian Gow was apt to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he paid full attention to the papist menace , it could consume twice that time . He had not been in Glen Lyon long when he began to recognize that Finlay Macnab , grandson of the clan 's patriarch , had unusual prospects , and when he consulted the local dominie he was pleased to hear : ' The lad masters his numbers quickly and learns to read more ably than others older than himself . ' The teacher said that Finlay had also acquired a fine , open style of lettering , and this obviously pleased him , for he said : ' Clear handwriting is proof of a clear conscience . ' When Ninian Gow made his first report to old Macnab on the boy 's progress , he broached the subject of the University of St. Andrews as a likely target for the lad 's ambitions . Finlay 's grandfather had never considered sending his grandson to college , but he had such a high regard for the good sense of the new minister that after he heard him out , he said he would think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Andrews ? ' That simple question was all Master Gow needed : ' It lies on the coast of Fife , an old city of gray stone hard by the Northern Sea . It is marked by ancient ruins and fine new college buildings . It 's the foundation of Presbyterianism in Scotland , and it is not by accident that its once Catholic cathedral is now in ruins . God struck it down . And along its hallowed streets , set deep within the cobbled stones , stand memorials to the founders of our religion whom the papists burned to death for refusing to abjure their new Presbyterianism . ' ' It sounds like a holy place , ' said Macnab , and his wife nodded silent agreement . ' It 's more ! ' the minister said , revealing a hitherto hidden side of his character . For a small town it has an unusual number of taverns , twenty-three in all , it 's aid , where the scholars gather after their studies , and of course it has the gowf . ' ' The what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fair green stretching beside the sea . A wee ball stuffed with feathers . Three clubs to smash it with , and four happy hours in the windy Sunlight . ' ' Surely it 's not a game you 're speaking of ? ' the dour Highlander asked . ' Aye , the grandest game of them all . All the scholars at St. Andrews play at the opwf , I more than most . ' i'Do you still play ? ' Macnab asked . 1 ' Aye , that I do . We have no links , that 's true , but I have my clubs and I brought  | with me three wee balls , and in the evening I like to hit them far and away down the meadows , making believe that I am once more at St. Andrews , studying the Bible at St. Mary 's College and playing along the links at the seaside . ' On many occasions he returned to the subject of St. Andrews and the feasibility of young Macnab 's reporting there for schooling , but finally the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mind to seeing a grandson of mine take up the ministry . ' ' Oh , sir ! Only a few who attend St. Andrews elect the ministry . It 's for everyone . The merchant . The laird . The man who sends his ships to Holland . ' But what would a grandson of mine profit from such a place if he was to come back to this glen and live as I have lived ? ' The learning , man , think of the learning ! ' And he spoke with such reverence for the simple act of knowing that Macnab began to consider this curious possibility : that a son of the glen could attend the university and become a better man for having done so , regardless of what occupation he followed thereafter . The practicability of such a move became so challenging to Macnab that one afternoon he walked down to the kirk and asked the minister . Tell me one thing . What boy in a crofter 's glen needs Latin ? ' and Gow said softly : The boy who is destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so perceptive that after supper Macnab held a quiet discussion with his wife and their clever grandson . Would you like to go to St. Andrews , as the minister says ? ' he asked the boy , and Finlay replied : I 'm good at books . First ; in Euclid and Cicero . ' To what purpose ? ' the old warrior asked in real perplexity . I do n't know , ' Finlay said honestly . ' I like to play about with figures me ' ' . words . ' What say you , Mhairi ? ' Macnab asked his wife . I have always thought he was a lad of promise . ' That means he would make a good drover . ' I would , ' Finlay said eagerly . ' I could drove the cattle to Falkirk for the Tryst this year . ' You ? ' the old man asked in wonder , for he had not perceived his grandson as ready for such responsibility . How old are you , lad ? ' Twelve . ' At twelve I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had fought the Campbells . . . three times , ' his wife reminded him . So you would like to go to the college ? ' the old man asked . ' I am so minded . ' As the summer progressed , Macnab ruefully conceded that he would never again trudge over the far hills to Falkirk , and that it was time for his grandson too do so : Besides , there will be older friends to help when it comes time to bargain with those clever buyers from the south , ' and once this big question was settled ,  | the old man agreed that Finlay should keep some of the money from the cattle sale and proceed to the University of St. Andrews . By July all was settled , and Ninian Gow was writing letters to a friend of his in the old gray city : I am sending you a fine wee laddie , Finlay Macnab of Glen Lyon , age thirteen when he arrives . Take him under your wing and tutor him for the University , which he should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euclid , is knowledgeable in Sallust and is capable in all ways . Nina Gow Post scriptum : I am converting heathen Highlanders into good Christians at such a rate that John Knox must be smiling . The last half of July and all of August were spent in preparing Finlay for the arduous task of droving his cattle to the great market at Falkirk , nearly eighty long miles to the southeast over steep mountain crests and down beautiful glens . The boy practiced with Rob , the deerhound-collie who would do most of the work ; whistled signals would direct the dog to round up strays and keep the herd moving forward , but at times it would seem as if the dog was directing the boy and not the other way around , so quick and intelligent was this remarkable animal . Meanwhile , the boy 's grandmother had been gathering the things she must supply : the strong cheese , the beef strips dried in the sun , the oatcakes hardened on the windowsill , and particularly the great kilt in which her grandson would live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kilts , little more than a pleated skirt tied at the waist ; this was a Highlander 's fighting-droving kilt , a huge spread of patterned fabric  --  crimson-green-red for the Macnabs  --  which covered the body from head to heel , with much left over to form a cape in case of storms . When his grandmother had it trimmed to her taste , she threw it on the ground , spread it out , and commanded her grandson : Lie down . ' And when he placed himself prone upon it , so that it reached from his ankles to well beyond his head , she showed him how to roll about and dress himself in it , not rising to his knees until it was properly fitted , and then to a full standing position so that he could fasten the overage about his waist , to be unwound when needed . A Scots Highlander dressed in such a kilt carried twenty pounds of tartan , a kind of ambulatory tent , which kept him safe in all weathers . When he stood before her , wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome lad he is , with the flashing blue eyes of his clan . And his youthful styes did have that fire , for in the eighth and ninth centuries the Vikings of ( Norway had guided their longships to the fjords of western Scotland , raiding and  | ravishing , and many Highlanders carried the strain of those heroic days : stalwart bodies , placid dispositions until aroused , and always , scintillating eyes like those of the Macnabs . You 're ready , ' his grandmother said . Toward the end of August the first drovers appeared in the glen , and all stopped by the home of Macnab of Dunessan to exchange greetings and information . They were from the Outer Islands mostly , men from Lewis and Harris and the Uists who had shipped their cattle by boat across the Minch to the Isle of Skye , and then through the perilous open fjord which separated Skye from the mainland . Any drover from the Outer Isles who reached Glen Lyon with his herd intact was already a hero . These Islanders were an uncouth band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable them to function . Short , dark , somber in mien and rude in manner , they terrified the normal mainland Scot , who said : Two Skye men passing through a glen are worse than three floods or four thunderstorms . And a Uist man is worse . ' They stole cattle , robbed cottages , terrorized daughters , and left scars wherever they touched . They were the scourge of Scotland , the Island drovers who knew not God . But in Glen Lyon they met their match , for the various Macnabs , long inured to battle , were themselves some of the most polished cattle thieves in Scottish history . It was said of the present Macnab , that sanctimonious , churchgoing scoundrel , that he loves animals so tenderly that he feels it his responsibility to take into his care any strays that wander his way . ' Many a Skye drover entering Glen Lyon with one hundred and twenty-one animals departed with only one hundred and eighteen , and it was frequently remarked at how good a cowman Macnab was , since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick eye make the drover , ' Macnab often said , and he had both , plus an ingredient he did not specify : he was fearless in the prosecution of his trade and took great risks in augmenting his herd . On the cattle trails he had lived with two dirks hidden in the folds of his kilt , and he had never been afraid to use them . He now quietly handed a pair to his grandson , with the admonition : If you ever touch your dirk in a fight , be prepared to use it all the way . ' He would be placing eighty-one head of cattle in his grandson 's care , perhaps more if things went well before departure , and since it would have been idiotic to trust so much of value to so young a lad , even though he was a husky fellow well able to care for himself , he was sending along a helper , Macnab of Corrie , who , with his two dogs , had made the trip many times before . They would be twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they would expect to deliver to Falkirk Tryst a full eighty-one head , plus such others as they might casually acquire en route . In the meantime , Ninian Gow instructed young Finlay as to what he must do when the cattle had been delivered and sold : You are to leave Falkirk and walk  | directly to Dunfermline , keeping your money well hidden in your kilt without mentioning it to anyone . From Dunfermline , head straight to Glenrothes and then to Cupar , from which it will be an easy walk to St. Andrews and the university , where you will inquire for Eoghann McRae , with whom you will live and who will tutor you for entrance to the university . Above all , lad , be prudent , for this is your entry into the world of learning . Make it a good one . ' That was the miracle of Scotland . From the most impoverished hovels , from the farthest glen , dedicated ministers and schoolteachers identified boys of promise and goaded them into getting an education at the universities in Aberdeen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those centers of learning whose scholars down through the centuries have done so much to alter and improve the English-speaking world . Unable to find employment in Scotland , they emigrated to London and Dublin and New York . They made Canada and Jamaica and Pennsylvania civilized places in which to live ; they started colleges in America and universities in Canada . A thousand enterprises in England would have failed without the assistance of the bright lads from Glen Lyon and the Moor of Rannoch and lone shielings on Skye . They would govern India and South Africa and New Hampshire , and wherever they went they would leave schools and hospitals and libraries , for they were the seeds of greatness and of civilization . There was no sensible reason in the world why a grandson of Macnab of Dunessan , drover and cattle thief extraordinary , should aspire to St. Andrews to study Latin , except that for two thousand years the men who governed the world , making it in each century just a little better , had known Latin . And from the moment Gow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lad with the potential to become such an individual . At about this time various women in the glen remarked that the minister had come to them begging for curious ingredients : He asked for raisins . Wanted to know who had currants . Was especially eager for some orange peel , and who has such in Glen Lyon ? ' He borrowed also , with no promise ever to pay back , spices , flour , suet , a dozen eggs , a healthy dram of whiskey and two pounds of butter . When all was assembled he went to a young Widow Macnab whose husband had recently died fighting the Campbells and asked her help in sewing a heavy cloth bag , and when this was done he sought permission to use her kitchen : But first we must find some treacle , for without treacle it would be nothing . ' Then he was ready . In my home near the Grampian Hills we called it a clootie dumplin ' , a dumpling made within a cloth , ' and when the ingredients were properly mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cloth , sewed it up , and pitched it into a pot of boiling water , where it seethed for six hours , no less . When it was done , heavy as stone , Ninian Gow told her : My mother boiled me one when I set out for college . It will keep twelve days , maybe sixteen , and give the pining lad a kiss of love as he eats each morsel . '  | Finlay celebrated his thirteenth birthday at the end of August . Next morning he rose early , eager to head south with his eighty-four cattle , his grandfather having acquired by usual means three additional head . While Rob barked at his heels , his grandmother , with tears in her eyes , gave him his bundle of dried beef , his grandfather handed him a stout walking stave , and Reverend Gow appeared with a heavy gift which he described as a clootie dumplin ' : Eat it sparingly , lad . It should keep you in good health to St. Andrews . ' And the dominie , a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only present he could afford : a notebook he had used in his schooling from which a third of the pages had been torn . Keep healthy , lad , ' his grandmother called , for she might not see her grandson again for a dozen years . Keep mindful , son , ' his grandfather shouted , tapping his own waist where his dirks were kept . Keep honest , ' the minister said . Keep to your books ' was the dominie 's admonition , and the boy was on his way . His route was eastward down Glen Lyon , a marvelously quiet beginning with hills lining the way , but he was soon joined by a rough Skye man coming across the hills from the dark Moor of Rannoch to the north . Finlay , afraid there might be trouble , drew close to Macnab of Corrie , then said boldly to the Skye man : These are the cattle of Macnab of Dunessan , ' and when the Skye man finally led his cattle off on their own route , he left behind , unknowingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His herd was now eighty-five . At midpoint in the glen Macnab of Corrie said : It 's best we go boldly over the hills , ' so they forded the little stream that defined the glen , their cattle lowing in protest , and climbed steeply into what Corrie warned was dangerous ground : This is Campbell country , and when a man droves cattle across such land he does so at his peril , for Campbells will sweep down at any moment and steal half his herd . ' This theft and countertheft among the Highland clans was not judged in the harsh manner it would have been in England , where misappropriation of another man 's horse or cow could mean a hanging . Highlanders stole each other 's cattle in a kind of game , a test of gallantry and intelligence , with always the chance that one clan might rise up in desperation and launch a general slaughter  --  not of the other clan 's cattle but of the clan itself . It was heroic competition , and none wei more cruel at it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macnabs . There was a saying among the drovers from Skye : ' To avoid th Macnabs in Glen Lyon takes twenty more miles , but it could save you twen animals . '  | When the Macnabs dropped down to beautiful Loch Tay they traveled eastward along its northern shore for many miles , then entered with considerable nervousness the narrow glens leading to Campbell lands , and after they had reached a spot where it was necessary to bring the cattle into an orderly ring for the nights rest , both Finlay and Corrie felt uneasy . They slept fitfully while their three dogs watched the cattle , and as they had feared , at dawn a loud , ferocious man challenged them : This is Campbell land , and who might you be , trespassing upon it ? ' Finlay was about to say proudly that these were cattle of Macnab of Dunessan , but Corrie , mindful of the fact that the Macnabs had always sided with the ; viacdonalds in wars with the Campbells , said deceitfully : We drove for Menzies of that Ilk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the fee for passing here is wo of your beasts , ' and when Finlay started to protest , he growled : No beasts , no ) assage . ' Corrie , sweatingly eager to maintain peace , said quickly : I 'll find you two , ' but he Campbell said : ' I ' 11 do the picking , ' and he sorted out two of the best . When the huge guardian started to leave with the animals , Finlay was co outraged that he reached for his dirks , and although he was only a lad and pitifully smaller than the Campbell , he would have tried to stab him from behind had not Corrie restrained him : Laddie , sheath your dirks . There 's a better way . ' And the big man departed , not realizing how close he had been to death . The two Macnabs made as if they were leaving the glen , but that night , in the silvery glow that passed for darkness in these high summer latitudes , Corrie , Finlay and the dog Rob circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the subtlest whispers , Corrie instructed the boy as to what his dog must do : Send him to the far end . Tell him to fetch us three . But make no noise . ' To one not acquainted with the Highland sheepdog , it might seem preposternus to expect Rob to understand such a thieving mission , but the dog was an enthusiastic conspirator and something of a thief himself , so quietly he ran to the grazing beasts , separated five , then turned two loose when Finlay whistled softly in the darkness . Edging the cattle southward to where his master waited , Rob delivered them without a sound to the boy , who swiftly joined them to the Macnab herd and even more swiftly spirited the whole group out of the Campbell domain . When all were safe , Corrie , not a demonstrative man . leaped in the air , and in the light of the newly risen moon , grasped Finlay 's hands and cried : The Campbells stole two of ours but we rescued three of theirs ! ' To celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never before tasted anything so good as this grainy mixture of wheat , fruit , spices and honey , for had he ever before feasted with such mixed emotions : to have outsmarted a Campbell , to have watched his dog steal the cattle so skillfully , and now to eat in  | remembrance of his kind minister and mentor Ninian Gow . . . This was a day not to be forgotten , and at its close , when he and Corrie spread their tartans on the bare earth , when Rob and his two helping dogs circled the Glen Lyon cattle , he somehow passed from boyhood to young manhood . With his claymore at his belt and his herd now augmented to eighty-six , he felt ready for the great Falkirk Tryst . He had become an accomplished drover on the route and he would become an equally accomplished trader when the throng of English buyers pressed down upon him , seeking to stampede him into an early sale to their advantage , not his . But he could not sleep . This day had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he might have to leap at the Campbell with his dirk ! As the August night waned and the stars wheeled overhead , Rob became aware that his master was uneasy , so the dog left the care of the cattle to the other two dogs and came to lie with Finlay , and when dawn broke they were still lying there , both asleep , both exhausted from the previous day 's excitements . Why had Falkirk been chosen , years ago , as the center for this great cattle exchange ? No one knew , except that Scottish drovers had learned that this was about as far south as their animals could travel without beginning to lose weight , and the English buyers knew that this was about as far north as they cared to adventure into a land that was , in their opinion , still uncivilized . Falkirk formed a reasonable compromise , and a happy one , for in this year 1805 , with peace in the land and the great Scottish rebellions of 1715 and 1745 only memories , a horde of wanderers not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the edges of the cattle field , and here they offered revelry of a wild and often bawdy nature . There were mountebanks from Lowland Scotland , magicians from England , actors and singers from Edinburgh , women who cooked warm and delightful dishes and their husbands or companions who sold tots of whiskey under the trees . It was a traveling carnival , policed by dour watchmen who sprang into action only when some Highlander threatened to cut out the gizzard of the Englishman with whom he had been trading : Now , now , laddies ! Stop that foolishness ! ' And often the drover , the Englishman and the constable , friends again , would repair to one of the trees and get seasonably drunk . Falkirk Tryst lasted about two weeks , during which the cautious Highlanders tried every trick known to their ancestors , a canny lot to begin with , to lure the Lowlanders into paying a more than favorable price for the cattle , while the Lowlanders hesitated , delayed , and even threatened to leave Falkirk altogethe ' , trying to scare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fail to fin , a buyer . The two Macnabs had improved their chances considerably by the tradition . Glen Lyon process of stealing unwatched cattle from their neighbors , and no  | their herd numbered ninety-one , and since every beast added to their original lot had been a choice animal , they now had a rather fine selection to offer , and Finlay intended making the most of it . Seven different English buyers had sought to frighten him into disposing of his animals cheaply , and at the close of the second day Corrie warned : Laddie , you know we canna take these beasties home wi ' us , ' and he replied with a mature wisdom which startled the older man : Aye , and these buyers can not come so far and return home empty-handed . ' As Corrie watched his young charge he discovered that the boy had a positive affinity for sharp dealing . He actually enjoyed the danger of holding his cattle back despite the risk of being left with no buyers . He relished contact with the shrewd English experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , he found pleasure in joining the men who did . But what surprised Corrie most , this young fellow of his stood wide-eyed when the dancing girls with their many petticoats pranced about . Come away from there , ' the caretaker warned , but Finlay remained , enchanted by the pirouetting . Now the Tryst became a thrilling test of wills , and on each of those first seven nights Finlay and Come sat beside their valuable herd , arguing and eating a little more of that delicious clootie dumpling ' , until the once-plump cloth bag became as wrinkled as a hag , and on the eighth night , when the dumpling disappeared altogether , Macnab of Corrie said : Laddie , I think tomorrow we must sell , ' and at last Finlay agreed . The seven potential buyers had dwindled to three , and the one who needed the cattle most noticed that whereas the herd had contained ninety-one beasts at the start of the Tryst , it now numbered ninety-four , and they were choice . Said the would-be buyer to the helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked doing business with Macnabs . They care for their cattle . ' And for other people 's , ' his drover said admiringly . A deal was struck , and with some regret Finlay watched his precious animals herded south ; they had been fine cattle and on the trail they had behaved themselves and grown plump on the good Highland grasses . But now came the painful moment when the Falkirk Tryst drew toward a close . Tents were taken down and the music stopped . Mountebanks joked no more and the dancing ceased . Macnab of Come showed Finlay how to tie his coins into a corner of his kilt , then said : I shall take my two dogs and move westward toward Argyll , for I have business in Glen Orchy . You trend eastward toward St. Andrews , and Rob can fend for himself . He 's able . ' So the older Macnab left , with a heavy weight of coins sewn into a corner of his kilt , and his dogs went with him . Now young Finlay was left with a mournful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Falkirk Tryst for decades . He led Rob to the northern edge of the fairgrounds , and there he tied  | about his neck a small cloth bag into which had been placed the notation : This is Rob belonging to Macnab of Dunessan in Glen Lyon . Cost of his food guaranteed . Finlay Macnab of Glen Lyon . ' When the bag was secured , Finlay felt his throat choking up , so for some moments he looked away , but then he moved close to the faithful dog and talked with him : Rob , I may never see you again . You were the best , the very best of all . ' He could speak no more , so he knelt with his dog , embracing him , and finally he patted him lovingly and said : Rob , go home ! ' Obediently , the red-brown dog left his master and started on the long , long journey back to the head of Glen Lyon . He would be nine days on the trail , and would from time to time come pleadingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fed , for the note about his neck assured the owner of that place that next year when the Macnab cattle came south to Falkirk , honest pay for the dog 's feed would be delivered . Rob had gone about a quarter mile on this remarkable journey when he stopped for one last look at his young master , and it was only with the sternest discipline that dog and boy refrained from dashing madly toward each other , but the time for parting had come , and each looked with love at the other and went his way . It was self-reliant lads like this who walked over the hills from all parts of Scotland to the ancient Kingdom of Fife where , at the eastern edge beside the North Sea , the premier university of Scotland stood . Glasgow 's was bigger , Edinburgh 's more notable , Aberdeen 's the most scholarly , but St. Andrews was the peer , the heart and soul of both Scottish history and the Presbyterian faith . It was a noble university , gray and quiet in outward appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as if the preachers of half the Protestant world had come from this devoted town by the bitterly cold sea , where the warmth of theological disputation often compensated for the rawness of the climate . During his thirteenth year Finlay Macnab studied with Eoghann McRae , the tutor to whom Ninian Gow had recommended him ; he lived with this penurious man and shared his meager table , at which , after the so-called meals had ended , he would pore over his Greek , his moral philosophy and his figures . But in the : early mornings , when he and his tutor took their walk before breakfast , he would , observe the glory of St. Andrews , for in obedience to a very ancient tradition , its students wore bright red gowns , never black until they had acquired degrees , so 1 that the town seemed filled with brightly moving floes crs , hurrying this way and that , a blaze of red gowns darting into doorways . At age fourteen , Finlay was incorporated to the Leonardine College of the university , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  | him : ' Macnab , I 've good reports of your seriousness . I do hope you 'll be studying for the ministry . ' ' I have no call to the pulpit , ' Finlay said honestly . ' Then avoid it , by all means . But make yourself a scholar . ' ' With help , I shall , ' Finlay said . During his entire stay at the university he would not see his grandparents or his dog or the lovely shadows of Glen Lyon . He continued to live with his first tutor and to share the miserable meals , but now he was entitled to wear the famous red Sown and cherish this badge of scholarly fellowship . But at the beginning of his third year a totally unexpected transformation took place , as he explained to his tutor : ' I find I am not suited for the higher learning . ' ' You 're a true scholar . ' ' I no longer like the university . My mind runs to the moors  --  to action , to trading cattle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medics . You 're sick . ' He was not . His mind was clear and it was delivering a masterful image of the kind of man he was intended to be : one who acted , one who dared to take risks , one who loved the hurly-burly of the Tryst . Firmly he told his tutor : ' I am illfitted to be a scholar . I shall go home . ' At this moment of confusion he was visited by a man he had not expected to see again , Ninian Gow , who had been summoned back to the university to occupy a chair of some importance . Unaware of the agitation which had beset his young friend , he resumed conversation as if no change had taken place : ' Well , Finlay , what shall you do , now that you 're on your way to becoming a verified scholar ? ' ' The world has gone topsy-turvy , Master Gow . ' ' What could you mean ? ' the new professor asked , and in a burst of words Finlay revealed recent developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrent to flood along , then said quietly : ' God has instituted this confusion because He has extraordinary plans for you . ' ' What ? ' ' He wants you to do His work in Ireland . ' ' I know nothing of Ireland . ' ' God wants you to remain here at St. Andrews three more years , make yourself into a devout clergyman , then sail across the Irish Sea and save that benighted country . ' ' That I can not do . ' At age seventeen , Finlay was a well-organized , stubbornminded young man , able beyond his years and of firm convictions . He was devout , convinced that John Knox had been correct in leading the way to Protestantism , rid totally satisfied that Presbyterianism was the Lord 's chosen instrument for the salvation of the human race , especially the Scottish . But he did not want to becoitc a clergyman , for substantial reasons which he now revealed : ' I could never p 300 be a saintly man . When one of the Campbells took away two of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , had I not been stopped . ' Campbells deserve punishment , ' Gow said , but not killing . ' And when I walk through the shops , I like to stare at the pretty girls . ' Clergymen do the same . They marry . ' But I have not the inner calling . ' Gow studied this solemn declaration for some moments , then said with that generosity of spirit which would make him a notable professor , next at Glasgow and finally at Oxford : God summons us in different ways . He does n't require you to become one of his ministers , or even to finish university . Come with me , and remind yourself as to what service is . ' They walked to that sacred spot where Patrick Hamilton , born a Catholic but inspired by the reform teachings of John Knox , had been burned at the stake by the local Catholics : Finlay , he refused to recant even when they piled mor faggots at his feet . He was an enemy of popery , and so must you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton had died , Gow told of Ireland 's problems : We have planted , successfully I 'm sure , a mustard seed in the northern counties . Trusted Scotsmen by the score cross the Irish Sea to protect the land we 've won and to advance Presbyterianism against the onslaughts of popery . ' What could I do ? ' Finlay asked , and Gow said : There is a need for husbandmen , for fine merchants , for anyone who will help strengthen Protestant roots in that ill-fated land . ' That 's the kind of work I 'd be fitted for , ' Finlay said , and some days later , when Gow brought him the news that a Scottish landowner in Northern Ireland , a trusted Presbyterian , was seeking a man who understood cattle and horses to serve as factor on his estates , Finlay volunteered for the job . After submitting glowing testificates penned by Gow , by his longtime tutor McRae and by the principal of St. Andrews , he received from across the Irish Sea the exciting news that he had been selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said apologetically : My life was changed at Falkirk Tryst . I discovered that I belong with the sweating merchants , the mountebanks . ' When Gow indicated that he understood , the young man added : And the swirling petticoats of the dancing girls . ' When a man once has the Latin , he can never be completely lost . God will find : / you proper work to do . ' With little regret , Finlay Macnab laid aside forever the good red gown of St Andrews , unmatched in all the universities of the world , and set forth like many l another Scottish young man before him to walk across Scotland and say farewell to the lone cottage at the head of his glen , but when he reached it he found it occupied by a different set of Macnabs , for his grandfather and grandmother were recently dead , and even his dog Rob was missing .  | ' Did you ever know a dog named Rob ? ' Finlay asked , and when the new l tacnabs said no , he stood mournfully by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatched roof intact , and lamented the passage of the simple ones he had known here and would know no more . Adjusting his kilt , he s rted for that exquisite chain of western glens which would take him down to lasgow , where he would be looking for a boat to Ireland . As he began the journey that would ultimately lead him to Texas , Finlay was hteen , of average height , weighing eleven stone , four . He came from a line of n who had defended their rights in battle ; he was himself a skilled cattle thief , a ; ood man with the claymore , and one who loved the conviviality of his fellows . had three fundamental characteristics which determined his behavior. he was a fi rce Protestant whose ancestors had defended this religion with their lives ; he h ? a stubborn sense of honor which lay quiescent when respected but flared into th wildest self-defense when insulted or transgressed ; and he had a passionate lo e of freedom , which his people in the glen had sustained against Campbells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lessons of Greek and R man history , the accounts of his own clan , the records of his Scottish church , t e works of the great philosophers  --  had instilled in him an almost fanatical d ication to liberty , which he would not surrender easily . He was , in short , one of the finest young men his world was then producing , d there were other freedom-seekers like him arising in France , in England and Germany . But the most able pool of emigrating talent was developing within at intrusive Presbyterian enclave in Northern Ireland , where , in obedience to the rust of history , many young people were trending toward Texas without ever Laing they were headed that way . When they arrived , they would prove a most d fficult group to discipline , especially when the center of political control lay far tant in Mexico City , manned by persons of a different culture contemptuous of it aspirations . nlay 's employer in Ireland was a big , rugged man with the reassuring Scottish me of Angus MacGregor , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in putting together halfway between the towns of Lurgan and Prrtadown , southwest of Belfast , a tremendous holding of spacious fields reaching the way to Loch Neagh . It was on this estate that Finlay entered upon his duties : ' Young man , you 're to make my herds prosper , trade my horses profitably , end keep the damned papists in line . ' W hen the first MacGregor had come as a stranger to these lands , the populadon had been ninety-two-percent Catholic ; by the time he died , it was down to U. When the present MacGregor inherited , his occupying farmers were about km-percent Catholic , and now they were no more than eighteen-percent . In this orderly , irresistible manner the lush green fields of Northern Ireland were being  | rescued from popery , and after Finlay Macnab had been factor for a while , h. could boast : All my drovers are now trusted men from Scotland , loyal Highland ers who speak our tongue . ' These invaders became known as the Scots-Irish , ' which signified that in he tage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in terrain an , culture they were Irish . It was a powerful mix , this blending of two dispara Celtic strains , and they might more properly have been called Celts , for that s what they were : dreamers , wild talkers , men of dour concentration when neede , , and great colonizers . The free-living local Celts exerted a powerful negative influence on you Finlay , for they taught him the pleasures of good Irish whiskey and the joy f teasing the local lassies , two occupations which delighted him but which al s plunged him into serious trouble . One morning , after being unable to remem s r how the preceding night had ended , he looked at himself ruefully and mumbl I 've made a far journey from St. Andrews , ' and he was pleased that Profess r Gow could not see him now . In i8io , at the age of eighteen , he found himself involved in two situatio s from which there could be only one escape . He had fallen in love with t daughter of a Lurgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portado butcher . The squire would not surrender his daughter to a lad who seemed be t on becoming a rascal , and the butcher would not sell his mare to a young fello unable to pay a decent price . Young Finlay resolved the dilemma neatly : he sto both the girl and the mare , and after placing the former astride the latter , he led merry chase over the fields and roads of Northern Ireland . In the end he ab . doned both the girl and the mare , who were restored to their rightful owne while he , always a jump ahead of his pursuers , made his way secretly to Dubli where he caught a freight boat to Bristol in England , on the safe side of the Iris Sea . Unable to find work , he resorted to his traditional occupation of cattle stealin ; only to discover that in England this had never been a game . When he returned t his lodgings one evening with a fine cow , his landlord whispered : They 're aft . you , Finlay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Finlay suspected that this mig be an evil trick whereby the landlord hoped to get the cow for nothing , but he hi in a grove of trees just in case the constables really did come , and when he sa three of them snooping about he scurried down lanes and through alleyways t he reached the Bristol docks . Leaping aboard the first ship available , he fou himself , by ironic chance , headed for America 's most Catholic city , Baltimore . In 1812 , at the age of twenty , he arrived in America just in time to beco involved in the war starting that year , but after trying to decide whether he was . American patriot or a British partisan , he concluded that he was neither an offered himself to both sides , providing each with horses , cows , pigs , sheep angoats.  | By 1820 , when he was well established in Baltimore , whose German citizens liked to do business with him , his careless dalliance with Berthe Keller , daughter of a Munich baker , obligated him to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefty blond young woman he would never normally have chosen , but when his father-in-law died in 1824 , Macnab found himself proprietor of a flourishing bakery , which he quickly enlarged into a ships ' chandlery of impres Sive dimensions . He liked working on the beautiful Baltimore waterfront and was on his way to becoming a man of some importance , with a stodgy wife and three flaxen-haired children , when the inherited Macnab tendency surfaced , for in 1827 he was detected in a most nefarious transaction involving cattle owned by neighboring Germans . With no alternative but a term in jail , he decided to leave town . When his complaining wife , disgusted with his irresponsible behavior , refused to accompany him on his flight , he was rather relieved , for she had proved an irritable woman and he was glad to be shed of her . Leaving his two daughters with their mother , he kept his son , Otto , slipped out of Baltimore before the enraged cattle owners could pounce upon him , and headed for the National Road leading west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagerstown , when young Otto gained his first insight into the nature of this trip , and indeed his first childish glimpse into the structure of life itself . Although not yet six , he was a precocious lad who suspected that he and his father were leaving his mother for good , and this caused pain . He knew that where his father was involved , his mother had been a bossy woman , but with Otto she had been a loving protector , standing always as his principal support , and he missed her . Often in the morning he expected to see her coming toward him with a bowl of porridge , or at night with hot sausages . He was so confused in his loneliness that sometimes he wanted to cry , but his stern heritage  --  half dour Scot , half stubborn German  --  plus a warning look from 1is father forced him to bite his lip and march resolutely ahead . But at dusk , when lc crawled beneath his blanket , he did not try to hide the fact that he was Miserable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even though he did not fully understand why Finlay had fled Baltimore in such a hurry , he was lure that no blame fell on his father . A perplexed little boy , he stepped forth boldly each morning as they probed into the wilderness . One evening as they plodded along the ill-kept road , trying to decide where to spread their thin blankets for the night , Otto saw through the growing darkness a light that shone from the window of some cabin situated well off the road , and  | the little hut seemed so established , so different from the wandering life he was leading that an overwhelming hunger assailed him . Poppa , let 's stop here ! ' No , we 'll find a valley before real darkness : But , Poppa , the light ! ' On ahead . ' They kept to the road , this stubborn father and his son nearing six , and it was then that the little boy fixed in his mind the image which would live with him for the rest of his life : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , refuge from the lonely , shadow-filled road . And it was also then , because of the way in which his father urged him to move on , that he first suspected that he would not be allowed to share in that forbidden warmth , at least never for long . And whenever afterward he saw such lights at night his heart hesitated , fo he knew what they symbolized . Twenty-five miles west of Hagerstown the Macnabs had to make a crucial decision , for there a path deviated to the north , heading over the hills to Pittsburgh , an enticing target . Is it true ? ' Finlay asked a traveler as they stood at the junction . Do boats with steam engines leave Pittsburgh and run all the way to New Orleans ? ' They do , ' the stranger assured him . But you 'd be wise to beware of them . ' ' Why ? ' For three solid reasons , ' he said . They 're very expensive and would eat up your savings . They 're very dangerous , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them will steal what money you have left , cut your throat , and toss you overboard . Stay clear of those boats at Pittsburgh . ' Finlay accepted this advice , but the more young Otto thought about the mysterious boats of steam that wandered down a thousand miles of river , the more obsessed he became with them , and he pestered his father Let 's go to Pittsburgh . Let 's take a boat . I 'm tired of walking . ' And when Finlay reminded him of the dangers the traveler had pointed out , Otto said pleadingly : But you would know how to fight those bad men . ' There 's the money , too . We 'll need all we have when we get to Cincinnati . ' With a melancholy the boy would never forget , the Macnabs rejected the steamboats and continued their way to Morgantown and on to Parkersburg , whey. at last they would join the Ohio River , along whose grassy banks they would wal the last three hundred miles to Cincinnati . Otto was a thin , wiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall or robust man . But he displayed , even at this untested age , a cool efficiency and a stubborn determination . He intended one day to sail down the river aboard a steam vessel , and as he walked he remained constantly aware that off to his right , somewhere , lay the great river , and he could imagine himself breaking away from  | his father , heading north and finding it . He was satisfied that if he ever did so , some boat would see him , stop , and pick him off the bank . He was lost in such romantic thoughts one morning , when he let out a gasp which seemed to come from deep within , as if his heart had been touched : Oh , Poppa ! ' For there , in full majesty , rode the Ohio River , highway of the nation , bringer of good things to alien parts . Much bigger than he had imagined , more sinisterly dark , in its motion it bespoke its power and the fact that anyone who ventured upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louisville and Paducah . Poppa , look ! ' From the opposite shore a small craft had set out , obviously intending to cross to where the Macnabs waited , and Finlay told his son : That 's a ferry . It 'll come to our side and carry us across . ' We ride on it ? ' the boy cried with delight , and when another traveler said : We sure do , sonny , ' Otto kept his eyes riveted to this reassuring sight . But as he waited for the little ferry to cross the river , he became aware that something of magnitude was approaching from the right , and just in time he turned to catch the majestic approach of a large river steamer . Belching smoke , its great paddles churning the water , it was a thrilling sight . Well-to-do passengers lined its two tiers , their fine clothes enhancing its magnificence . It was the Climax out of Paducah , one of that grand , adventurous fleet which had started under the imaginative command of Nicholas Roosevelt in 1811 to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central areas Df America together . Oh , Poppa ! ' Otto cried as the lovely boat passed , for he had teen his first riverboat and it had captured him . Dn the ferry they crossed into Ohio , then followed country roads along the right bank of the river as it wound its way from Parkersburg through the empty wastes of southernmost Ohio and on to Portsmouth , where the Scioto River joins the Ohio . It was a journey of compelling beauty ; the vistas changed constantly ; at night solitary lights glowed on the opposite shore , indicating where some adventurous soul from settled Virginia had decided to test the wilderness in Kentucky . Deer accompanied the travelers ; and one evening a small bear approached their sleeping place when Finlay was absent , gathering sticks for a fire . Otto , who had ' sever faced such an adversary before , hesitated for one frightened moment . Then , tcalizing instinctively that he must protect their belongings , he grabbed the near.1t piece of wood and made right for the beast . Thrashing about with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for long . With a sweep of its paw the animal pushed the boy away , nudging him into a thicket . Astonished at the insolence of the beast , Otto first shook his head , then glared  | at the animal . With a grunt to give him courage , he fought his way out of the brush , uttered a furious yell , and charged back at the little bear , who was now rummaging among the Macnab possessions . Otto was prepared to do battle by himself , but his father , hearing the commotion , hurried back : Otto , no ! ' The warning was ineffective , for Otto was outraged by the brusque treatment the bear had handed him and was determined to drive the creature away , bu before he could resume his assault , Finlay rushed up and with a much larger stic belabored the animal , who growled , studied his adversaries , and rumbled off . Trembling , Finlay sat with his son beside the river , and there they remained a ? the long twilight waned . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of you . ' He was stealing our food . ' Never tangle with a bear . ' But it was only a little one . ' ' A bear 's a bear , son . Do n't ever tangle with one . ' ' But you did , Poppa . ' Finlay could think of a dozen appropriate , fatherly warnings : ' Yes , but I 'm grown man . ' Or , ' You were lucky it was a little bear . ' Or , ' If you have to fight . bear , do n't use a stick . Get a gun . ' He stifled such admonition , for he believed tha his son 's action had been proper . Once allow a boy to run away from a seriou ' challenge , he could continue to do so through life . Softly he said , as if Otto were his own age : ' You were right , son . If you start to do something , keep going and finish the job . ' They followed the good road along the Ohio right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty thousand where a few resolute Germans were already establishing firms to serve the various needs of the steamboats plying up and down the river . Three ferries crossed the river to service the citizens in Kentucky , and t after several exciting days Otto told his father : ' This is better than Baltimore . ' In many ways the little boy talked and acted like a grown man ; as frontier boys did , he was skipping a whole decade of his growing up ; he was already a mature young fellow who had walked six hundred miles through the wilderness and fought his bear . He knew what loneliness was , and how a great river served people . Because of his waterfront experience in Baltimore , Finlay had no trouble finding a job with a German merchant who needed his expertise in buying cattle ans hogs for the river traffic , and in pursuit of this work , he often visited the glamor ous steamboats that docked at Cincinnati . Aboard these craft he heard for the firs time about the real wonders of the river : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creole girls . Them great eatin ' houses . ' At the age of seven Otto began running errands for his father , learning the names of the steamboats and their home ports , and in doing so , he fell under the ' spell of a river town much different from New Orleans . He first heard of it from a IP  | t*ll bearded boatman with a poetic touch : Tell you what , sonny , when you ship dbwn the Mississip , as you surely will , the place you want to see is not New Orleans . The real spot is Natchez-under-the-Hill . ' ' That 's a funny name . ' ' It 's a golden name , like out of one of the Greek fables , like maybe the gods put k there to test men . ' He spoke with such music and strength that Otto leaned forward to catch his wards , and as the man continued he became not an ordinary roustabout but a onicler . ' To make things flower perfect , the gods built Natchez-atop-the-Hill , h gleamin ' white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep ings clean . That 's rich-folks country , and river folks like you and me , we ai n't lowed up there . For us the gods built Natchez-under-the-Hill , about the finest le spot in America . ' Aware that he had caught Otto 's attention , he moved his hands in ominous lures to indicate knives and daggers and pistols and gallows-rope : ' A man do n't ch out , they knife him . At night you hear screams , somebody 's bein ' murd . You hear a splash ! There goes a corpse into the Mississip . Men walk bent r , they 're smugglers . In the saloons you can get Tennessee whiskey , rots your t , or a bullet , ends your gut . And there are girls , and dancin ' through the ht . ' Otto missed not a word of this report , but the riverman would have been unded had he known the impact his words were having on this flaxen-haired But in succeeding days , when Otto heard more about Under-the-Hill , and n he had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , he wise enough , even as a boy , to conclude that the lower Natchez was a sorry frequented by men and women of a low degree . He could not have ex'ned why he was reaching this conclusion , or what it signified , but he was loping a powerful rejection of goings-on ; he was becoming a youthful conive , in the best sense of that word , who deplored gambling , knifing , girls danced all night . . . and general irresponsibility . He opposed them all . His father was also hearing a new word , one that would exert an equal influc on his life . Because Cincinnati specialized in butchering hogs , it was known Porkopolis , and one of Finlay 's duties was to provision riverboats with ham , and sausage . One day after Finlay had loaded a boat bound for New s with seventy salted carcasses , the satisfied captain paid him , then uttered a Finlay had not heard before : ' We find ourselves with extra cargo space , . Could you scurry about and find us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , because it 'll be transshipped to Texas . ' ' Where 's that ? ' ' Surely you 've heard of Texas ? Garden spot of the continent . ' ' Where is it ? ' Tart of Mexico now , but not for long . '  | What do you mean ? ' Texas is the ass end of Mexico , which do n't give a damn for it . Each trip make down the Mississippi , I carry men from Kentucky and Tennessee who ' goin ' to Texas . Stands to reason that with their long rifles , they ai n't gon na 0 Mexicans for very long . They 's gon na bring Texas into the Union , and the soon : the better , I say . ' Why do people go there ? ' Finlay asked . To get rich ! You plant cotton , it explodes in your face . You plant corn , you g t two crops a year . Cows have twins in Texas , it 's the law . And you get a leagu - and-a-labor , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league is four thousand four hundred and twenty-eight acres of pasturelan , ; , you get it free for cattle . A labor is a hundred and seventy-seven acres of belt r land you get for farming , also free . ' I ca n't believe it . ' You get it the minute you step acrost the border and say ? What 's your nam ? Finlay Macnab ? When you step up and say " Here I am , Finlay Macnab " you g t all those acres of the best land in America . ' You said it was Mexico . ' It 'll soon be America , you can count on that . ' Macnab asked so many questions about Texas that he became known along t waterfront as a prospective settler , and one day a Mr. Clendenning invited him i lunch aboard one of the steamboats docked at the wharves . Can I bring my son Finlay asked . He dreams about steamboats . ' To be sure , ' Clendenning said expansively , and when they were seated in t spacious dining salon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This is how we live on the great boats , sonny . ' Do you live here ? ' Up and down . ' You live on the river ? ' For the time being . ' How long ? ' Until I 've visited all the ports of call . ' He now explained to Finlay that he w. the traveling representative of the Texas Land and Improvement Company , heal quartered in Boston , and his pleasant task was to sell future immigrants to Tex the best bargain this weary old world had ever seen . Pushing away the dinn plates , he spread an interesting series of documents on the table and said : This scrip , authorized by the Mexican government and fully backed by the Texas Lan and Improvement Company of Boston , Massachusetts . Each unit of scrip you b i entitles you to one acre of the choicest land in North America . Buy yourself thre or four thousand units , and you 're set for life . ' Did you say buy ?  | ' Yes . You deliver this scrip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and survey your three or four thousand acres . ' ' I was told I would get a league-and-a-labor free , something like four thousand nacres . ' I ' No , no ! You 're entitled to the league-and-a-labor , and it 's there waiting for you . But you have to bring the scrip to prove your legality . My firm vouches for you , says you 're of good character , and you get the land . ' Macnab felt deflated . For some days now he had been visualizing his four thousand acres of choice land , his for the asking , and now to find that he must buy something in order to qualify was disheartening . He supposed the cost per acre would be something like a dollar or two , and so large a debt he would not be able to manage : ' How much is this scrip ? ' ' Five cents an acre . ' Clendenning , noticing the relief in his prospect 's face , said heartily : ' That 's what I said . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it legal . ' While Finlay was congratulating himself on such a bargain , Clendenning added encouragingly : ' So what our more responsible customers do , they put up one thousand dollars and get title to twenty thousand acres . Then they are really in business . ' ' Can I get so much ? ' ' Dear friend ! Mexico wants you to come . They want you to settle their vast empty spaces . You can have forty thousand acres if you wish , but I 've been recommending only twenty . More manageable . ' ' Have you been there ? Have you seen the land ? ' ' Macnab , do you know the passage in the Holy Book , " A land flowing with ilk and honey " ? Some day we 'll find that a man from Texas wrote the Bible , for hat describes the land precisely . One day I was walking beside the Trinity River 4  --  marvelous stream  --  and what did I see ? A shattered old tree whose insides were h lied with honey bees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed regiment . And right beside that tree one of the sturdiest cows ever you saw , king to give milk . A land flowing with honey and milk , just like the Bible says , ' ' How many acres would you go for , if you were me ? ' The salesman did not answer . Instead , he turned to Otto , and with a benign k suffusing his face , said : ' I would think only of my son . If I could get twenty uusand acres securely in my hands , and improve it , when I died I would leave this lad ' ? and here he stroked Otto 's head ? ' a fortune of incalculable wealth . ' In the pause which followed this sensible advice , he smiled at Otto , then added : ' Can 7ou imagine your son at age twenty , with his bride at his side , taking command of farm of twenty thousand acres ? The cattle ? The fields of corn ? The faithful Yes working the cotton ? And you sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Old Testament ? ' Mr. Clendenning did not press Macnab to make a decision that day , but as the  | three left the boat Finlay did furnish a useful bit of information : I could handle the thousand dollars , if your company guaranteed that I 'd get the land . ' Guarantee ? ' Clendenning cried as if his integrity had been impugned . Look at these guarantees ! These ironclad papers . ' He made no attempt to close the deal , but when the boat sailed next day for New Orleans , he did leave behind a set of handsomely printed papers which specifically ensured the legality of any sale which might develop . Being a cautious Scot , Finlay carried them next morning to the office of a German lawyer with whom his employer did business to seek an opinion , but before the lawyer , a man with a high collar and long-tailed coat , would give it h - handed Finlay a card on which was printed : ALL A LAWYER HAS TO SELL IS HIS TIME AND HIS JUDGMENT THEY 'RE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE TO HIM How much ? ' Two dollars . ' Good . ' The lawyer studied the documents left by the representative of the Texas Land and Improvement Company , then shrewdly pointed out : This is a Boston company presuming to do business in Mexico . I find nothing that binds the Mexican government to honor the promises made here . I 'd be very reluctant to hand my good money over to such an agent , with so little to back his claims . ' I wondered . ' How much is he charging for the land ? ' Five cents an acre . ' The lawyer was dumfounded , and showed it . Land touching Cincinnati was selling for two hundred dollars an acre , and he had during the past week supervised the sale of some four hundred acres . Five cents was meaningless . How many acres . . . ? ' Twenty thousand , ' Finlay said . Again the lawyer gasped : I ca n't imagine such a piece of land . ' Taking a pen , he multiplied some figures and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful land here , out in the country to be sure . But one thousand dollars is lot of money . ' Twenty thousand acres is a lot of land . ' And Texas is nowhere . ' The lawyer rose and placed his arm about Macnab 's shoulder It 's Mexico , remember , and from what we hear up here , that 's a most unstable country . It 's not like Prussia , even England . . . and God knows it 's not like the United States . ' They tell me it soon will be part of us. '  | But you do not buy land on such a fragile expectation . Very dangerous , Macnab . Now , if you seek a farm , I know some excellent ones , but if you want full value for the two dollars you paid me , take my advice and buy several plots I . now which abut on the river . Growth there is unavoidable . ' He even quit his race to show Finlay the land he had in mind , and it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so for some days Finlay 's dreams deserted Texas and focused upon a chandler 's shop on the Ohio . He never saw Mr. Clendenning again , but toward the end of January 1829 , mother salesman from the Boston firm came ashore from an upriver boat , and where Clendenning had been persuasive , this man was brutally forceful : ' Macnab , he land 's selling like icicles in hell . You 'd better grab your twenty thousand . ' ' I 've heard bad reports about the influx of criminals . Men who 've been there say s a madhouse . ' ' One or two men fleeing their wives , a handful escaping unjust debts , and that 's ut it . I 'd judge Texas to be one of the most moral states in Christendom . ' When Finlay demurred , the salesman grew angry , a tactic which worked along e frontier , where men appreciated harsh opinions firmly stated : ' Damn it all , acnab , if you 're so lily-livered , write to Stephen Austin hisself and ask him , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founder of the Amerisettlements in Texas . That night Macnab drafted his letter : Bell 's Tavern Cincinnati , Ohio 27 January 1829 Dear Mr. Austin , My son Otto , aged seven , and I are contemplating a permanent remove to Texas and feel great solicitude about the nature of the population which will inhabit your country . We have been informed that you permit no one to settle within the limits of your colony unless able to produce vouchers of good moral character . This we can do , from Ireland of the north , from Baltimore and from this town , and we should like to live among other settlers of equal repute . We are , however , much disturbed by rumors current here that only the worst venture into Texas and that our prisons are filled with persons of low character who swear that as soon as they are turned out they will head for Texas , for they say that it is a territory in which a man with ideas and courage can make a go of it , by which they mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of a responsible crowd gathered here willing to try our fortune in Texas , and we are awaiting the return of a Mr. Kane who  | left us last September to explore your country . If he gives a good repo we shall want to join you , but in a letter from the east bank of th Sabine River dispatched in October he warned us : Tomorrow I sh . cross over into Texas . Pray for me , because I am told that no man is saf west of the Sabine . ' What are the facts ? We are also apprehensive about becoming citizens of Mexico , for hear that it is a country ruled by brigands who have a revolution twice year . Again , Sir , we are desirous of true information . Respectfully you Finlay Macnab Presbyterian Remembering the lawyer 's warning that the scrip carried no guarantee that Me ico was bound to honor it , Finlay wanted to ask Austin for clarification , but t salesman protested : You would n't want to worry an important man with a trivi ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed . In the weeks following the posting of this letter Macnab interrogated m. travelers regarding Texas and received conflicting reports . Said a Georgia man : ' noble land . More salubrious than either Alabama or Mississippi . Ideal for t propagation of slaves , and high-spirited . I 've never had a regretful thought sin establishing my plantation there . ' But an Arkansas woman who had fled the colony for the civilization of Cinci 1 nati groaned : Texas no more ! They call where me and my man lived a town . N stores , no schools , no church with a steeple , and no cloth for sewin ' . My old m and me had a race to see who could get out the fastest , and I won . ' But then came a response from Stephen Austin himself : San Felipe de Austi Coahuila-y-Tejas 20 April 1829 Dear Mr. Macnab , Your letter of 27 January reached me yesterday and I now put aside . other occupations to answer the sensible enquiries you make relative this country . You express an understandable solicitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1823 when I returned from Mexico City to proce with settlement of my colony , I found that certain criminals had i trated and I immediately adopted measures to drive them away .  | I forced them to cross back over the Sabine River , but from sanctuary in Louisiana they conducted raids into Texas , and what was worse , they lied about our colony , circulating every species of falsehood their ingenuity could invent . They were joined by others of their kind who had come to the Sabine , hoping to invade our colony , and there they sit in their bitterness , circulating lies about us . I can assure you , Mr. Macnab , that the citizens of Texas are just as responsible and law-abiding as those of New Orleans or Cincinnati , and that ruffians will never be allowed in this colony . The settlers already here are greatly superior to those of any new country or frontier that I have ever seen and would lose nothing in comparison with those of any southern or wester it state . They are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever settled a frontier . You say you are apprehensive about living under the Government of Mexico . Let me assure you that the policy which Mexico has uniformly pursued toward us has been that of a kind , liberal and indulgent parent . Favors and privileges have been showered upon us to such an extent that some among us have doubted their reality , so generous have they been . The present ruler of Mexico is a man to be trusted , and the Constitution of 1824 , under which he rules , is just and liberal , and in no way inferior to the constitutions of your various states . I can foresee no possible trouble that you might have with the Government of Mexico , which is now stable and far-sighted , and of which I am proud to be a citizen . The minor disturbances which do sometimes arise down in Mexico never affect us here . We stay clear and have nothing to do with them . All that is required in Texas is to work hard and maintain harmony among ourselves . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most pleased to have you join us . Stephen F. Austin en Macnab received these warm assurances he surrendered all doubts about tu , telling his son : It may have a few rascals , but so did Ireland , and I can several in this town . ' He began to collect all debts owed him and to set aside k kw and precious things he and his son would carry with them to Texas , but two problems arose . Austin 's letter had been so reassuring that Finlay , despite a cautious Scot , had buried his uneasiness about the validity of scrip ; he was to buy some , but found no one at hand to sell him any . And he had opcd a real fear of riverboats . Four different steamboats , which he himself provisioned , had blown up , with heavy loss of life , and he became apprehenhmt the one he chose for passage to Texas become the fifth .  | Otto , of course , was eager to board anything that floated , and each day he kep his father informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sailed soutl without the Macnabs , Otto would list its replacement : Climax left , but Rive Queen tied up .

Cabot Wellington Texas Land and Improvement Boston , Massachusetts Now Macnab had to consider seriously his passage to New Orleans , and as he w talking with experienced men at the tavern , one chanced to mention an alternati to boats : Have you ever thought of walkin ' down to Nashville and pickin ' up t Natchez Trace ?

And if'n you knowed American history , you 'd know that the great Meriwether Lewis , him as went to Oregon , he was murdered comin ' home on the Trace . ' ' Do travelers still use it ? ' ' They do . ' ' Is the road still open ? ' ' It ai n't a road . I been tryin ' to tell you that , but you wo n't listen . It 's what its name says , a clear-cut trace through the wilderness .

' Other travelers who had journeyed up the Trace gave such confirming reports that Macnab had pretty well decided to follow that land route , when a chance conversation with a loquacious Pittsburgh boatman just back from Natchez raised en ugly question that cast a shadow upon the entire Texas adventure . ' The conversation started favorably : ' It 's grand , driftin' ' down the rivers , walkin ' home along the Trace . ' ' How many miles can you make a day ?

Walkin ' back , sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added something which Finlay found attractive : ' Some men make twenty , steady , but I often like to lie under the trees ... in daylight , I can watch the birds and the squirrels . ' ' They told me murderers prowl the Trace . ' ' That ended twenty years ago . But let 's be honest . I do hide my money carefully our different spots so I can give up a small part if I meet up with a holdup With a deft move of his right hand he produced an imaginary purse from left breast . ' And I do feel safer if I travel with others through the lonely parts . ' ' I wish I could have you as my partner , ' Finlay said .  | ' I wo n't be walkin ' the Trace no more . But if you 're set on headin ' for Texas , that 's the cheap way to go , and you hero ' a Scotchman . . ' We call it Scotsman . ' ' Of course , when you get there , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . ' ' What do you mean ? ' The boatman looked soberly at Macnab and said : ' You 're a Presbyterian ? I suppose you know that before you can get land in Texas you have to swear to the Mexican officials that you 're a true Catholic . ' ' What ? ' ' And your son will have to be baptized in the Catholic faith . ' ' I never heard . . ' My brothers and me , we was thinkin ' of Texas , but we 're Methodists , and when we heard about that religion business . . . no , no . ' ' You give me dismal news , ' said Macnab . ' I 'm not sure I should risk going to Texas . ' Things were in this delicate condition when a suave and stately gentleman alighted from the Pittsburgh boat , announcing that he was Cabot Wellington from Boston , looking for a Texas traveler named Finlay Macnab . He was what was known in the trade as ' the finisher , ' the relentless man who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect . As soon as he saw Macnab he cried enthusiastically : ' Dear friend ! I bring you your passport to riches , ' and he betrayed no disappointment when Finlay drew back , refused to accept any papers , and asked bluntly : ' What 's this about converting to popery ? ' Grandly , and with a condescending smile , Wellington said : ' Many ask about that rumor , and there 's no better way to explain than to consult with a settler who already owns an estate in Texas , ' and he whistled for a raw-boned , prearranged fellow of forty , who sidled up and allowed that he owned one of the best estancias . in Texas . ' What 's an estancia ? ' ' Fancy Mexican word for farm . . . real big farm . I was born , bred a Baptist . Virginia man . So when I gets to Texas , I ai n't hankerin ' to turn my coat , not me . Trick 's simple . Do n't let no Mexican priest convert you , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's five or six Irish priests . Yep , imported direct from Ireland , through New Orleans . They never seen Mexico City or none of that . ' ' What are they doing in Texas ? ' Finlay asked , for he had grown suddenly afraid , knowing that there were not in this world any Catholic priests more devout and stern than the Irish . He wanted no Irish priest converting him , because that really would be forever . ' Stands to reason , the Mexican government , they cai n't persuade any real Mexi-  | can priests to travel all the way to Texas . Those hanker after the fleshpots of the big city . So the oney priests they can get to work in land s'far away are Irishmen who cai n't make no livin ' in Ireland , and who cai n't speak a word of Spanish neither , if'n you ask me . ' Are n't they real fanatics ? ' ' No ! No ! There 's this big , jolly , whiskey-guzzlin ' priest called Clooney , goes about on a mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds , free and easy , with him knowin ' it ai n't serious just as well as we know it ai n't . ' Did he convert you ? ' Yep . Father Clooney 's the name , and a fairer man never lived . You let him sprinkle a little holy water over you , hand in your scrip , which Mr. Wellington here will give you , and you get your league-and-a-labor . ' Is that right ? ' Macnab asked . It is indeed , ' Wellington said , and the Texas man added : The scrip solves ever'thin ' , and the day after you get your land you can revert to bein ' a Baptist again . I did . ' ' I 'm Presbyterian . ' ' My mother was a Presbyterian , ' Wellington cried with real enthusiasm , and the deal was settled . Finlay Macnab and his son were entitled to twenty thousand acres of the choicest land in Texas , purchased at the ridiculous price of five cents tin acre . to was delighted when he learned that a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to become reality : And we 'll go by steamboat ! ' t he grew apprehensive when Finlay reviewed the perils of such a river trip : 1You know , Otto , the steamers often blow up . Pirates attack from Cave-in-Rock . ' Out when Otto said : Maybe we better walk down , ' his father said : Robbers infest t route . Meriwether Lewis got murdered , ' and the boy summarized their situa : Getting to Texas is n't easy . ' But now Finlay devised a stratagem which would be useful regardless of which c they adopted . They assembled with many furtive moves a pair of homespun sers for the boy , just a little too large ; same for Finlay ; long lengths of cloth tical with that used in the trousers ; hats for both ; cloth identical with the hats ; pair of long , heavy needles , very costly ; and most important of all , their total . ngs were converted from paper and small coins into gold . W hen all these items had been smuggled into Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent intrusion , and began sewing . In the lining of the hats , the waists of the pants and down the seams of the legs , he sewed his new tlaterial , imbedding as he went , here and there , the gold coins he had acquired . Nrlcn he finished , the Macnabs were going to be walking mints , as he demonword when Otto 's pants and hat were finished : Try them on . '  | Otto did not like the hat , for he had rarely worn one , and he could scarcely si down because the coins made the pants far too stiff , but Finlay made him take th pants off , threw them on the floor , and jumped on them repeatedly : Now them ! ' And the pants were manageable . The Macnabs now doctored Finlay 's garments until they , too , were gold-laden and then they joined in solemn compact : When we reach the Trace we will neve mention , not even to each other , where our gold pieces are till we get safe Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to break the promise immedi ately , for he said : One piece hurts my bottom , ' and this , of course , had to corrected . They were an attractive pair of emigrants as they crossed the ferry into Kentuc and started the three-hundred-mile hike to Nashville . Finlay was thirty-seve medium height , blue-eyed , trim of carriage and sharp of mind . He 'd had a sol education at St. Andrews and a wealth of practical experience in the Unit - States ; he also had that engaging quality which would attract the eye of an unmarried woman looking for a good husband , and his easy manner acquire , from working with Irishmen in the old country and with river folk in this mad him an amusing addition to any group . Having outgrown those earlier acts impulsive immaturity that had forced him to flee both Ireland and Baltimore , h now gave the appearance of a man who could work hard and earn his family decent living , for he was very protective of his son . He was , in brief , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws open its doors to immigrants , and h was typical of many who were beginning to swarm toward Texas . His seven-year-old son was even more good-looking , with his blond hair pee , ing from beneath his new cap , his quick step and his thin face that looked almo , sallow , for the sun seemed not to affect it . He wore heavy shoes , new homespu pants that came an inch below his knee , a thick woolen shirt and a manly kerchi , about his neck . When strangers were with the pair for any length of time the were apt to remark : The father has a quick mind . But the lad , he 's quiet , alwa seems to be thinking about something else . ' This was an accurate description of Otto . The confusion caused by his abru , separation from his mother , the long walk to Cincinnati when he was first seein the world , the loneliness at night , the fight with the bear , the constant departu of the steamboats he loved , leaving him always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosions and sudden hangings  --  these unchil like experiences , assaulting him so constantly , had aged him far beyond his yea Save only for the experiences of puberty , he was really a steely-eyed young ma better prepared in some ways for the Natchez Trace than his more ebullie father . But they were both hardened to the road by the time they completed their firs  | two hundred and eighty miles and approached the bustling city of Nashville . There Finlay made a characteristically bold decision : What we 'll do , Otto , is buy us as many cattle as we can handle , and we 'll drove them to Natchez , put them on the boat to New Orleans , and sell them at a huge profit when we get to Texas . ' Once this grandiose plan was voiced , no counsel from the experienced travelers in Nashville could dissuade him , and when stockmen pointed out that it was four hundred and eighty miles to Natchez , a right far piece for a man to drove cattle , he snapped : Shucks , my grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , with his thirty head of good stock , one of the sellers said : He 'll find that Tennessee ai n't Scotland . ' They would need a dog to help them , and Finlay knew they could never find one of those flawless dogs of Scotland and Ireland that could herd sheep and cattle better than a man , but they could find themselves some mongrel who would nip at the heels of strays . Since one dog would be about as good as another , Finlay left the selection to his son , and the boy identified a collie-sized female with the kind of face any boy would love . Her name was Betsy and she was owned by a family with three sons , each of whom had pets galore . When Otto asked , in his quiet voice , his blue eyes shining , what she would cost , the mother cried , almost with relief : Take her ! ' but two of the boys bellowed that she was their dog , whereupon their mother said : All right . Five cents . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a reddish coat , a pointed nose and a set of the swiftest legs in Tennessee , but she also had a devious , calculating mind and was prone to stop and study whenever a command was given , judging whether Finlay really meant what he was saying . If she detected even the slightest hesitation , she ignored him and went her way , but if he shouted Damnit , Betsy ! ' she leaped into action . She was , in certain important ways , brighter than either of the Macnabs and she intended to train them , rather than the other way around . The one weakness in her plan was that she quickly grew to love Otto , for he would play with her , test her running , wrestle with her , and keep her close to him when they slept on the ground at night . He also fed her , meagerly at times , but no matter how hungry she became between the food stands run by the half-breed Indians or between the deer shot by Finlay , she always sensed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stomach was growling with emptiness , so was Otto 's . With their cattle they could make only eight or nine miles a day , but at least they did not have to worry about pasture for their herd , for the Trace provided ample grass . Slowly , slowly they edged their way toward Texas . Some eighty miles into the Trace they came upon the first of the notable stands , those extremely rude taverns which sometimes had food and sometimes did not , depending on whether the surrounding Indians had brought in their crops . This one was the infamous Grinder 's that the Kaintuck in Cincinnati had warned  | about , a rough cabinlike affair containing two rooms , in one of which travele could sleep on the floor , and a spacious porch covered by a sloping roof , wher : overflow travelers also slept on bare boards . This time the stand had food , and when the broth and meat and potatoes hat passed around , the men began to talk of Meriwether Lewis ' tragic death twen years earlier in 1809 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners o the stand were out of the room , someone in this house shot him in the back , an ? I have a mind who done it . ' He looked ominously at the door . You seem to forget , ' another expert said , that he was killed not inside th stand , but outside , ' and this evoked such heated discussion that the owners wer summoned : Was Lewis killed in here or out there ? ' Out there , ' a woman said , irritated by the constant bickering over this ancie crime . You know that my uncle was tried in court , all legal like , and not a wor ' was proved agin ' him . Clean as a baby 's breath . ' When the owners were back at work in their part of the house , one man sal , firmly : My uncle knowed the coroner , and the coroner said : " Meriwether Lew ' ' was killed inside the house , because the back of his head was blowed off and throat was cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder , rejecting it as one more aspe of the rowdy life he did not wish to lead , and he was about to go outside and pla with Betsy when the innkeeper said sternly : Time for bed ! ' But when Otto starte ? to call Betsy inside to sleep with him , one of the men growled : We do n't allow n damned fleabags in here , ' so Otto and Betsy , curled together , slept on the porc In the morning they had covered about a quarter of a mile when Otto let out yell . Still unaccustomed to wearing a hat , he had left his at Grinder 's , in th sleeping room , with that passel of dangerous men , so without waiting for hi father , he and Betsy dashed back and burst into the stand : Forgot my hat . ' It w , on the floor beside a Virginia man , and when Otto reached for it , the man lifted i and found it suspiciously heavy . Hefting it quietly in his left hand so that othe could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made no comment , but before turning the hat over to Otto he accompanied the boy to the porch , where he said in very low tones : Excellent idea , but yo would be prudent if you kept it close to you . ' And he bowed as if delivering legal opinion to a fellow citizen . It was not easy walking the Trace . When rains persisted , freshets formed , an what had been easily negotiable gullies became roaring torrents . Then the tray elers would have to camp for three or four idle days until the rains and the rive subsided . Six men might be waiting on the south bank , heading for Nashville , ant three on the north , destined for Natchez , and they would call back and forth , bu  | they could not cross . Each year some impatient souls would try , and their bodies would be found far downstream , if found at all . Now , in the late summer of 1829 , the Macnabs with their dog Betsy and their thirty cows were pinned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in this frustrating but not dangerous position that they met their second Kaintuck . He was a huge man , well over six feet , with bright red hair and massive shoulders ; he was traveling alone and seemed indifferent to danger , for even though it must have been obvious that he was coming home carrying the profit from his trip , bandits had learned not to molest the Kaintucks , who observed one governing rule : ' If'n he makes one suspicious move , shoot him . ' This Kaintuck , bearded , scowling and irritable , was on his way north to pick up another boat in Cincinnati or Pittsburgh , and the impassable flood infuriated him . ' What the hell you doin ' with them cattle ? ' were the first words he hurled across the treacherous stream . ' Taking them to Texas , ' Finlay shouted back . ' You 're a goddamned fool to try it . ' That ended that conversation , for Finlay had no desire to defend his operation to a stranger . But as night was settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your dog , son ? ' ' Betsy . ' ' That 's a damned good name and she looks to be a damned good dog . ' ' She is . She helps us . ' ' I 'll wager you need her , with all them cows . ' ' We could n't move without her . ' ' I 'll bet you 're a big help , too . ' ' I try to be . ' That was the beginning of Otto Macnab 's fascination with the Kaintuck . During the two tedious days that followed , with the Macnabs only about eighteen feet from the huge man , Otto and he conversed on many subjects . ' Study this stream , son . Looks like a man could jump acrost it , and they say they 's a man in Natchez that could . Big nigger with legs like oak trees . But do n't never try it , son . Because one slip and they pick your bones up ten miles downstream . ' ' Where do you live ? ' Otto 's high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever seen . A real hog wallow . ' ' Why are you going there ? ' ' Because it 's home . ' ' That sounds dumb . ' ' It is dumb , but it 's home . ' ' How 's your fire ? ' ' A fire 's always in trouble . With wet sticks , particular . ' ' Ours is all right . ' ' That 's because you ai n't dumb , and I am. '  | The two talked as if they were equals , which in a way they were , for the big man had ended his education at the level Otto was beginning his , and the more they talked the more they liked each other . The Kaintuck shouted that he 'd had a wife , and a pretty good one , but she had died in childbirth : ' You know what that means , son ? ' Otto may have been wise beyond his years , but there were certain important things he did not know , and now he faced one of them . Biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' I think so . ' ' Well , ask your father . ' ' You tell me . ' ' That ai n't my prerogative . ' ' What 's a prerogative ? ' ' Right , son . Some things is right , some ai n't . Ask your father . ' When Otto did he received a totally evasive answer , and it occurred to him that the Kaintuck would not have answered that way , but he sensed that he was caught in a mystery that was not going to be unraveled there by the pounding flood . In late afternoon of the third day it became apparent that the flood was going to subside during the night and that passage would then be possible , but before it got dark the Kaintuck launched one more conversation . ' What 's your name , mister ? ' ' Macnab , Finlay  --  and the boy 's Otto . ' ' That 's Scottish , no ? ' ' You 're the first person I 've met who did n't call me Scotch . ' No comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Zave ! ' Otto cried . ' What kind of name is that ? ' ' Best in the world . Named after one of the great saints . Francis Xavier . ' A hush fell over the subsiding stream , and after a long while Macnab asked : ' ls it that you 're papist ? ' ' Aye , but I never force it . ' Macnab said no more . He felt uncomfortable sharing the wilderness with a papist , the more so because when he reached Texas there was bound to be unpleasantness over the matter of forced conversion , fraudulent though Father Clooney 's were said to be . He had seen enough of the Protestantism-papism fight in Ireland and he wished for none in the forests of Mississippi . But as the darkness lowered and shadows crept from the trees like black panthers come to steal the cattle , the Kaintuck spoke again : ' Macnab , you need help with them cattle . ' No comment . ' Else you 'll never get them to Natchez . ' No comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek lowers . . . and we cross . . . ' What ? ' It was a child 's voice , trembling with excitement . ' I was wonderin ' if maybe we could form partners . '  | ' Oh , Poppa ! ' The boy gave a wild cry of delight and started to dance about , then grasped his father 's hands : ' Oh , it would be so .. e The boy could not frame his thoughts , and added lamely : ' It would be so welcome . ' ' How about it , Macnab ? ' ' Poppa , Poppa , yes ! ' For three wet days Otto had watched the big man across the swollen stream and each new thing he saw increased his attachment to the wild Kaintuck . He was strong . He had violent manners when necessary . He could laugh and make jokes at himself . And obviously he had grown to like Otto . ' Where you really from , Zave ? ' The voice was adult and suspicious . ' Like I said , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to settle in Texas ? ' ' From what you and the boy said , might as well . ' A world of meaning was carried in this brief , elliptical sentence : the conclusions of a man without a home , without prospects , without any visible or sensible direction in his life . If what Macnab said about the glories of Texas and the twenty thousand acres of choice land was true , what better ? Now , across the muddy waters , the Kaintuck pleaded : ' I ai n't got no home , really . I ai n't got nothin ' much but down the river , up the river , and if you really got all that land , I could be mighty useful . ' No comment . ' Besides , Mr. Macnab , you ai n't goin ' to get them cattle to Natchez with just the boy to help . ' ' Please , Poppa , please . ' ' What 's your full name , Zave ? ' ' Francis Xavier Campbell . ' Good God ! In the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rannoch had tracked down a Macnab of Glen Lyon , and as in the ancient days , plotted his murder . ' Campbell is a forbidden name , ' Finlay Macnab cried in the darkness . ' Ever since Glencoe . ' ' I know Glencoe , ' the voice from the other side said , ' but that was a long time ago . I am Campbell from Hopkinsville , not from Glencoe , and I seek to join with you . ' ' Please ! ' came the boy 's voice , but in the night Finlay warned his son about the infamous behavior of the Campbells at Glencoe : ' I can hear my grandfather 's voice : " Wherever , whenever you meet a Campbell , expect treachery . " Across that stream waits a Campbell . ' And through the long dark hours Finlay kept watch on his ancestral enemy , as if the dreadful crime at Glencoe had marked with bloodguilt every Campbell who would come along thereafter . At dawn , as Finlay expected , big Zave Campbell gathered his muddy possessions , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Macnabs . Finlay , preparing to fight if necessary , shouted : ' Come no more ! ' But Otto , seeing in Zave a needed companion , cried : ' We want your help ! ' and in that fragile moment he settled the argument , for he ran and leaped into Campbell 's arms .  | Come with us , Zave ! ' he cried , and from then on , it was four who went down the Trace : Finlay Macnab in command ; Otto watching and listening ; Zave Campbell , with a home at last ; and the dog Betsy , terrified of the big man 's commands . Under his tutelage she became twice the shepherd 's companion she had been before , for when he told her to Git ! ' she got . From their meeting at the flood they faced two hundred miles to Natchez , and often as they walked  --  ten miles a day now  --  Zave complained : Hell , I walked up this whole distance and now I 'm walkin ' down . ' You asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first ten he kept close watch on Campbell , waiting for the sign that would betray the intended i treachery . As the eleventh day waned he began to perspire so heavily that Otto asked : Are you sick , Poppa ? ' and he replied : I sure am . Do n't you remember that it was on the eleventh night at Glencoe that the Campbells cut the throats of the Macdonalds ? ' Otto said : Last time you told me they shot them , ' and Finlay snapped : What difference ? ' When the sun set , Finlay refused to go to sleep , satisfied that once he closed his eyes this Campbell would cut his throat ; instead , he sat against a tree , rifle across his knees , and when Otto rolled over at midnight and opened his eyes , there his father waited . They both looked a few feet away to where Zave snored easily , and when the boy arose at dawn nothing had changed . Campbell was never told of the night-long vigil , but on the twelfth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody herds cattle better than you . When we reach Texas and get our land , you can have your share . You earned it . ' You can build your barn right next to ours , ' Otto said . You any idea how big twenty thousand acres is , son ? ' With a twig as chalk and a sandy bank as blackboard , Zave lined it out : Six hundred forty acres to a square mile . Six-forty into twenty thousand , that 's thirty-five , thirty-six more or less square miles . That means ix miles to a side . So my barn ai n't goin ' to be very close to your barn . ' That day he showed Otto just how far six miles was going to be : Remember this little stream , way back here . I 'll reckon the miles as we drive the cattle , but you keep in mind how far away this stream is , ' and as they walked off the miles the boy gained his first sense of how vast things in Texas were going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of farm ; the way Zave explained it , the place would be an empire . Zave then took in hand Otto 's real education : I 'm surprised you cai n't shoot proper . I was your age , I could hit me a sparrow . ' Using his own long rifle , he taught the boy the tricks of hunting , especially the art of rapid loading : Cai n't never tell when that second shot , fired prompt , is goin ' to turn the trick . ' He drilled Otto in firing accurately , then reloading at finger-numbing speed : You got to do it in rhythm , like a dance . And always in the same order . Prop your gun . Right hand , grab your powder horn and pour in just enough . Right hand again ,  | drab the wadding . Left hand , take the ramrod from its place , jam it down the muzzle , tamp down the wadding . Left hand again , ball from the pouch , slide it in . Right hand , take the percussion cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Otto began dropping birds and squirrels out of trees and reloading instantly for the next shot , Zave was ecstatic : ' Macnab ! I think we got us a real man on our hands . ' The hunting experience that Otto would remember longest , however , came early one morning when he was following a squirrel as it leaped through the trees . From the north came a soft whirring sound which increased until it was a dull persistent thunder , and when he looked up he saw coming toward him more irds than he had ever imagined ; the sky was dark with them , and as they came in always-increasing numbers , the morning sun was blanketed and a kind of twilight dl over the earth . All morning they came , a flock so great it must have covered tire counties and even large parts of states , an incredible flight of birds . Passenger pigeons , ' Zave said . Always have flown that way , always will . ' Once hen the birds were low overhead he fired a musket at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down eleven , and the eating was good . On they went , two Macnabs , a Campbell and a dog , droving cattle through nely and forlorn land as their ancestors had done for centuries in the Highlands f Scotland , and at last they arrived in Natchez , that **29;1123;TOOLONG town of great beauty perched high on its hill above the Mississippi , ith its squalid row of half a dozen mean streets down on the flats , where the eat boats docked , where the saloons never closed , where boatmen from Kentucky and Tennessee lost in an hour what they had slaved four months to earn . As they drove their cattle along the main streets , lined with expensive and lamorous houses , Otto knew instinctively that he and his companions were not intended to stop there ; threatening stares of passers-by in costly clothes told him that , but he was not prepared for what he found when Finlay and Zave herded their cattle down the steep streets leading to the waterfront . Now they passed into an entirely different world  --  of sweating black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being warped into position , side by side , and bands of musicians playing music endlessly . Natchez-under-the-Hill was its own town of several thousand , and here the commerce of the great river basins  --  Ohio , Missouri , Mississippi  --  came temporarily to rest in huge warehouses that groaned with the produce of America . It was an exciting place , a steaming hodge-podge of black and white , of Virginand New Yorker , of buyer and seller , of slave and free , and many a man who pow owned one of the big white-pillared houses on the hill , with many servants oclaiming his wealth , had started buying fish and timber on the wharfs . But it was also a frightening place , with knives flashing in the dark , and Zave Campbell showed young Otto the spot where one of the greatest knife fighters of than all , Jim Bowie of Tennessee , had demonstrated his ferocious skill . Bowie  | had this fierce knife and he allowed hisse'f to be tied to a log , and his enemy , hi was lashed down too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duckin ' , ant Bowie cut his man to shreds . ' What did he do then ? ' ' He asked his brother Rezin to make him an even bigger knife . Foot and a hal long , with a heavy guard protectin ' the handle from the blade . ' ' Why did he do that ? ' ' He said : " When you 're strapped to a log , you cai n't have a knife that 's to long . " ' ' Can I see him ? Where is he now ? ' ' Who knows ? They run him out of Tennessee . ' When it came time to arrange for the cattle to move south toward New Orlean Macnab discovered two painful truths : the cost of taking them by steamboat w ; prohibitive , and he had wasted his energies bringing them down from Nashville ' Man , ' he was told , ' we find all the cattle we need in New Orleans . They brin , ' em in from everywhere . ' And when Finlay pointed out that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guffawed : ' Hector , come here and tell the man ! ' Hector was a dumpy fellow in his forties . He had been to Texas and proposes to return as soon as the two boilers for his sawmill reached Natchez from Pitt , burgh , where they had been bolted together and caulked . ' Cattle to Texas ? ' la said . ' That 's the craziest thing I ever heerd of . Cattle run free all over Texa , millions of ' em . I hire two Mexicans to keep the damned things off'n my place , ' Are you telling the truth ? ' ' Come here , Buster . ' The sawmill man called everyone Buster , and when h had Finlay seated on one of the pilings of a wharf he explained : ' Cattle bee breedin ' free in Texas since the Creation , or as some say , since the Spaniard arrove . Cattle everywhere . Big . . . huge horns . . . best eatin ' beef God evq made , and , Buster , strike me dead if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lasso ... ' ' What 's a lasso ? ' ' Mexican-style rope . You form it in a loop , and you wo n't believe me when tell you what a tricky hand can do with that loop . ' ' It 's hard to believe what you say .

' Where should be twenty-eight for sale , but what he did not know was that it was physically and morally impossible for a Macnab or a Campbell to pass through territory containing cattle without enlarging his herd . By old established practices , they had acquired an additional five head . In the end they had to sell at a severe loss , but the transaction was not without its benefits , because the buyer was a man who ran a repair shop for steamboats , a kind of inland ships ' chandlery , and when through casual conversation he discovered how experienced Finlay was in such matters , he pressed him to accept a job serving the big riverboats . At first Finlay demurred , so the man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for your beef . ' This was too gratifying for a trader like Macnab to refuse , for as he explained to Campbell : We make a neat profit on the animals , and we can save money for our start in Texas . ' He went back to the man and said : I 'll take the job , but you must employ my friend Campbell , too . He 's a mighty worker . ' I 've seen Campbell on other trips . He eats big and works little . ' He would not hire the big Kaintuck , but Macnab did find Zave a job sweeping out a saloon , and when the three settled in to Natchez-under-the-Hill as if it had always been their home , Texas grew farther away . The only problem was Otto . He was eight now , not much taller than before , and the long tradition of the Macnabs required him to get started on his education , but schools were not a major feature of Under-the-Hill . There were some on the upper level , but it was difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was told quite bluntly : We do not look kindly upon boys from Under . ' There was , however , a woman on the lower level , now married to a roustabout , who had once taught school in the rowdy town of Paducah when it was still called Pekin , and she said that she could teach Otto reading , writing and numbers up to the rule of three . She was a mournful lady , spending much of each class telling the boy of her more fortunate days in Memphis , where her father sold furniture and coffins , but she developed a real liking for the lad and gave him a rather better education than he might have received in the more fashionable classrooms of the upper level . It was curious , Otto thought , that the two towns were so separate ; a person could live his entire life in one , it seemed , without ever venturing into the other . Under-the-Hill was the bigger , the more flourishing and also much the wilder , but just as he had discovered on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabin in the wilderness throwing light and comfort into the  | darkness , so now he knew where the good life lay in Natchez : it thrived in those big , clean , white houses atop the hill , and whenever they had the chance , he and Zave would climb the steep streets and walk aimlessly beneath the arching trees , looking at the mansions . ' You ai n't to think , son , that everybody in there is happy , ' Zave cautioned , and he showed Otto two especially fine houses from which a boy and a girl , desperately and hopelessly in love , had come to Under-the-Hill to commit suicide . And he also knew which big one had contained the man who had run away to Pittsburgh , abandoning his wife and two daughters . ' My father ran ? ' ' Do n't tell me about it ! ' Campbell thundered , and Otto pondered these complexities . The year 1830 passed , with Finlay earning substantial wages on the waterfront and with Zave Campbell promoted to bartender , where he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trio was prospering financially , but Otto was not advancing in much else , for he had mastered about as much learning as the Paducah woman could dispense and was beginning to lose interest . Also , he was reaching the age when circumstances might throw him in with the rowdy urchins who pestered ship captains when their boats were tied up , and Otto himself worried about this , because everything he had so far observed inclined him toward an orderly life away from the excesses of Under-the-Hill . In that whirlpool even children witnessed murders and shanghaiings and young women committing suicide and endless brawls , and he had no taste for such a life . At age nine he had become more than cautious ; he was a little Scots-German conservative set so firmly in his ways that they would probably last a lifetime . One aspect of life Under-the-Hill he could not adjust to : the presence of so many women . It occurred to him as he looked back upon his travels that he and Finlay , and even Campbell , had always moved where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront , in the stands of the Trace , it had been a man 's ; world . Even in settled Cincinnati when they talked with people who had been in Texas , they had met only one woman , the Arkansas lady who had fled . But now they were surrounded by young women , and he perceived that even " tough men like his father and Zave sometimes wanted to be with them , those very pretty girls with only first names , and although he did not understand fully , he knew it must be all right . What irritated him , though , was that the girls sometimes showed as much interest in him as they did in Zave and his father , pampering him and petting him and offering to cut his hair . They were , he realized , doing this so as to impress Finlay and Zave that they were the motherly type , and he grew quite sick of the attention . But his irritation was forgotten whenever Zave and one of the young women from the saloon took him down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi . Then he liked it if Zave 's girl cheered when he hit  | a bottle and Zave did not , or when with two quick shots made possible by adroit reloading he shattered two bottles . You 're a little sharpshooter , ' a girl said one day as she kissed him , and this he did not protest . That night he was startled when he overheard his father proposing to a new arrival from Pennsylvania that the man purchase his Texas scrip : Partner , I 'll sell you this for half what I paid , and you can see the figures right here . Twenty thousand acres , one thousand good American dollars . ' The newcomer said he would think it over , carefully , for his heart was set on Texas , and he visualized the twenty thousand acres in terms of the ultra-rich farmland of Lancaster County . He might never find such a bargain again . Otto was distraught by his father 's proposal , and he discussed it with both his teacher and Zave , and they , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : You have a treasure in your son Otto . Do n't waste him in this sewer . ' You 're doing well here . I 'm doing well . ' I have no choice . You do . ' ' A hundred men have started Under-the-Hill and moved up . And I 'm to be the hundred and first . You watch . ' And what in hell will you have if you do move up ? Take your kid to Texas and make him a man . And take that worthless Campbell with you . ' Zave was even more insistent : Finlay , I 'm workin ' here only to save money to get to Texas . This is the cesspool of the world . I just been waitin ' for you to say the word . ' ' You 've got a good job , Zave . I got a good job . ' And Otto , he 's got nothin ' . He should be on a horse , on open land . . . and w should you and me . ' One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son . They were living in one room over Zave 's saloon , where the accumulation of eighteen rootkss months lay scattered about . I think , Otto , that in another year we 'll have enough money to buy a house on top . A hardware store , or maybe a general one like we had in Baltimore , with a good German bakery . ' ' People on top ai n't always happy , ' Otto said . Sometimes they do terrible things . ' ' Where 'd you hear that ? ' ' Zave told me . He showed me where . ' ' What would you like to do ? ' Almost defensively the boy drew Betsy to him , cradling her head in his lap , for he was afraid to expose his true longings , but under his father 's pressuring he blurted out like the little boy he still was : I 'd like to get aboard one of those steamboats , and stay aboard when the whistle blows , and just sail and sail , and Olen maybe have a horse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . '  | Next morning the man from Pennsylvania came to Macnab 's shop and said he 'd take the scrip , but Finlay said quietly : Yesterday it was for sale . Today it i ai n't . My son wants it . ' He never looked back . After giving his employer notice and receiving from hi an unexpected bonus , he told Campbell to quit his job at the saloon , paid the teacher more than she expected , and bought three passages on the New Orleans steamer Clara Murphy , which would be putting in to Natchez on Thursday morning , 25 August 1831 , on its way south from St. Louis . Otto was elated that his long-delayed dream of steaming down the river was a last coming true , and while Finlay and Campbell slept amidst the deck cargo , he and Betsy walked back and forth , surveying the mystery of this great river . It was trip into wonderland , and he never tired of watching strange happenings alon. , the shore : slaves shifting bales of cotton , mules dragging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That morning , still unwilling to sleep lest h ; i miss some dramatic scene , he imagined himself as captain maneuvering the Clap Murphy past treacherous sandbars , docking her at a plantation wharf where whit : women carrying umbrellas to protect them from the sun strolled aboard . Twice lachanted with the sweating black crew as they worked the boat , and he tried to hide his pleasure when they called him our little rivet-man . ' He was prepared , at the end of that first glorious day , to be a Mississippi man for the remainder of hi life . On this trip he saw the richness of Louisiana , for it seemed that all the wealt of the state was crowded along the shores of the river , and he perceived tha families acquired fine homes with vast lawns only when they owned many slaves Not once on this long , revealing trip did it occur to him that the slaves might hav : rights of their own or that their condition in 1831 could be temporary . They werblack , different in all respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was totally different from Cincinnati and Natchez . It exuded bot ; prosperity and pleasure and had a relaxed spirit the other towns lacked . It w. obviously very old , with strong French and Spanish accents bespeaking earlie settlers , and the mighty levees , raised high to keep the Mississippi out of the streets and homes , awed and impressed Otto . Also , there was a bustle about the city which delighted the boy , and he perceived that whereas the waterfront of Natchez had been unhealthy and unclean , that of New Orleans was vibrant an almost self-policing , as if the excesses tolerated in Under-the-Hill would be for bidden here . And there was burgeoning commercial activity . In one afternoon of casual exploration among the shippers his father was offered two jobs , but Finlay has learned from his Natchez experience not to take them lest he become entangle. , permanently in something he intended to engage in only temporarily . ' Very well , ' one trader with a French name said expansively . You 're the boss . But when you ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Ferry , New Orleans . buy your mules , your cotton , your timber . ' ' Do all those come from Texas ? ' ' Look at my yards . I get three parts from Louisiana , seven parts from Texas . ' ' How do I get my produce here ? ' ' Ships run all the time , but they 're expensive . Best way is with mules , herd in up and drove them in . Takes time but it costs nothing . ' ' You keep speaking about mules . Do n't you accept horses ? ' ' Rich people buy horses , now and then . U. S. Army buys mules all the time . ' fie wrote out his name and address for Macnab , and added : ' I 've got a better Put together a big herd of mules , bring them in for a good profit , and then with me as my manager of the Texas trade . ' ' Where would I find the money to get the mules ? ' Ferry broke into laughter : ' Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II them . Thousands , thousands  --  you just go out and rope them and they 're rs . ' ' Yes , but where do I get the mules ? ' ' Man , you buy yourself a strong jackass , throw him in with the mares , and let work himself to death . ' ' What happens to the male horses ? ' ' You drive them to New Orleans . I can always use a few . ' When Finlay looked ious , Ferry cried : ' You ever see a Texas mustang ? I got a yard full of them and I had a hundred more . ' He led Macnab to a corral , where for the first time lay saw the powerful little horses of the Texas range , much smaller than he expected , much finer-looking than he had supposed a small horse could be . ' They run wild ? ' He studied them carefully , exercising his eye trained among great horses of Ireland , then said : ' They told me in Natchez that cattle run too . ' Ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything runs wild . just reach out and grab . ' ' Why are n't you in Texas ? ' ' Because it 's a wilderness . Not a decent place to eat in the whole damned vince . And besides , it 's a Mexican wilderness , and who wants to live in a ntry that ca n't govern itself ? ' ' Some Americans seem to like it . ' ' Right ! Right ! And if I was that kind of American , I might like it too . ' ' What kind of American are you speaking of ? ' ' An American like you . Energy , courage , stars in your eyes . . . and willingto live alone . Because , man , Texas is empty . Just wild cattle and untamed As he said this , the young man who had brought the mustangs to New Orleans in the corral , and as soon as Otto saw him , he was captivated , for the  | herdsman was the first Mexican he had met . He was in his mid-twenties , whi. thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range : tight bl pants marked by a tiny white stripe , bandanna , big hat , boots and spurs . To 0 he looked the way a Texan should . Show them how you ride , ' Ferry ordered , and with just a slight flare a resentment at being spoken to as if he were a peasant , the young man flicked th brim of his hat almost insolently , but then smiled warmly at Otto : Is the youn man good with the horse ? ' I can ride , ' Otto said , and the young Mexican whistled to one of his assistan Manuel , traenos dos caballos buenos ! ' From a hitching rail near the corral , Manuel untied two horses already saddle and deftly the young man lifted himself onto the larger one , indicating that 0 should mount his , which the boy did rather clumsily . The Mexican then began to canter about the stable area , shouting to Ott ! ' Follow me ! ' and a delightful comedy ensued , for the Mexican rode with ski swinging and swaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the boy tried energetically to keep up , slipping and sliding and near falling from his mount . But he did hold on , grabbing his horse 's mane wh necessary . Ferry , Finlay and Campbell applauded the exhibition , whereupon the Mexi rider broke loose from Otto 's comical trailing to perform a series of beauti feats , ending with a full gallop at Campbell , bringing his steed to a halt a fe inches from the Kaintuck 's toes . The boy could learn to ride , ' he said as he dismounted , and when Otto . . up awkwardly , the Mexican helped him dismount and asked : Son , you want ride back to Texas with me ? And help me bring another remuda up for Da Louis ? ' Oh ! ' Otto cried with enthusiasm . ' That would be wonderful ! ' Who is this young horseman ? ' the senior Macnab asked , and as the rid continued talking with Otto , Ferry said : Young Mexican from Victoria . Sou Texas . Absolutely trustworthy . What he says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these animals ? ' He did . ' Where did he get them ? ' In this business you never ask . ' What 's your name , young fellow ? ' Macnab asked . Garza , ' the rider said , smiling . Benito Garza . ' He pronounced each syllab carefully , drawing it out in the Mexican way : Beh-nee-to Gar-tsah , ' with exagge ated accent on the nee and Gar . Having introduced himself verbally , he did symbolically with another flick of his finger against the brim of his big hat , . with that , he disappeared into the stables . At the inn where they were staying prior to arranging passage to their ne  | lands , the Macnabs and Campbell met two authentic residents of Texas , welleducated plantation owners who had come to New Orleans to arrange for the sale of their products on a regular basis . After they had reached an understanding with I.ouis Ferry , whom they lauded as the best man in the business , they chatted about aspects of their new home : ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts or Virginia . We plan to erect a notable state with all the advantages of South Carolina or Georgia . There 's a spaciousness to our view . We can see clear to the Pacific Ocean . And a nobility to our minds , because we 're determined to build a new society .. . ' Everything is of a vast dimension and we need men with vast potential to help us achieve what we 've planned . Weaklings will be erased , by the climate and the distance if by nothing else , but the strong will find themselves growing even stronger . Any young man of promise who does n't catch the first boat to Texas is an idiot .. When Finlay raised several questions about things that disturbed him , the two men laughed them off : ' The Frenchman said the food was inedible ? He 's right . Abominable . But it can only get better . The Arkansas woman fled because of loneliness ? She was surely right . My nearest neighbor is forty miles away , and I I't want him any closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when Finlay voiced serious doubts about the instability of the Mexican vernment , he noticed that the men became evasive , and he was about to find out whether they favored the ultimate incorporation of Texas into the American Union when the men changed the subject dramatically . The leader , spreading his bands on the table , asked energetically : ' And where do you propose settling ? ' ' I was about to ask your advice . ' ' Nacogdoches up here . Victoria down here . Both places wonderful for an eneric man , which I take you to be . But any reasonable place in between is just as ' Where are you ? ' ' I 'm down here at the mouth of the Brazos River . My brother-in-law , he 's up at Nacogdoches . ' ' Where should I go ? ' ' Wherever the ship deposits you . Landing in Texas is not easy . Sometimes the can make one spot , sometimes another . How much land you taking up ? ' ' I 've bought myself twenty thousand acres . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty spread . How 'd you hook it ? ' Proudly Macnab opened his papers , showing the men his authority for the pation of twenty thousand acres , as approved by the Mexican government , in  | any likely area . The men studied the papers , then looked at each other and said nothing . Pushing the documents back to Macnab , they changed the subject to shipping . What you must do is catch a steamboat that goes to the mouth of the Mississippi . A sailing ship will be waiting there to carry you to Texas . ' Why do n't the steamboats go all the way ? ' They 've tried it . Too many wrecks . It 's never easy to enter Texas . ' Where should I head for ? ' We told you . Wherever the ship lands you . It 's all good . ' When Finlay was back in his room he pondered the suspicious manner in which the men had reacted to his papers , and he began to worry that his documents might be faulty , so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to their room , knocking loudly until one of the men opened , ' the door . I apologize , but this is terribly important to me . Is something wrong with my papers ? ' No , no ! They 're in good shape . ' The man tried to close the door , but Finlay kept it open . They 're not , and I saw it clearly in your eyes when you looked at them . You must tell me . ' There was no light in the room , but the man propped open the door and invited Macnab to sit on his bed while he sat on the bed of his brother-in-law. , Painfully , hesitantly they told Macnab the truth : Your papers are a fraud . We see it all the time . ' You mean . . No standing at all in Mexico . Land is n't given out that way . That traveler in ' the next room without a single sheet of paper has as good a chance as you of getting land in Texas . ' How can such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your fake company is in the United States . The land is in Mexico . ' ' My God ! A thousand dollars ! ' In anguish Macnab leaped from the bed . Completely lost , ' the man said . But when Macnab groaned , the men both spoke in rushes of encouraging words . ' I did n't mean that everything is lost . ' You can still get land , excellent land , but never twenty thousand acres . ' You get it free . . . absolutely free . ' After this burst of warm reassurance , one of the men pressed Finlay to sit back down , then patiently helped as his brother-in-law explained the situation : You land in Texas wherever the ship drops you , and you establish con- , tact with the Mexican officials . Being Scotch , I suppose you 're Protestant , so you volunteer to convert to Catholicism . We 're both Catholics ,  | legally , but we 're really Baptists . Conversion entitles you to one thousand acres of land , maybe a little more because of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the same . If you 're lucky enough to be unmarried and can find a Mexican girl to marry , you could very well get yourself a league-and-a-labor , and that 's a lot of land . Or you could buy land from someone like the two of us who already has his league-and-labor . . . I have three , he has two . We have none for sale , but it goes for about twenty cents an acre and it can be very good land . Maybe fifty cents for bottomland along the river , and I 'd advise you to get some of that . Or you can apply to one of the great empresarios who already have legal title to enormous reaches of land , and you can get that for almost nothing , and sometimes for nothing at all , because they want settlers . I got mine in three different ways . Mexican government gave me some . I bought some . And Stephen Austin , as fine a man as you 'll ever meet , he was so anxious to get settlers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Originally one bit here , one bit up here and one bit way down there . But I traded even till I had them side by side , and now I have fifteen thousand acres for a little over two thousand dollars . You can do the same . ' The man on the bed asked in the darkness : Are you married , Macnab ? ' and after the slightest hesitation Finlay replied : No . ' They were pleased at this information , for it meant that if all else failed , he could marry a Mexican woman and get a quadruple portion . Why do they make it so complicated ? ' he asked . With Mexicans , nothing is ever allowed to be simple . ' A rickety old steamboat carried thirty American adults , nine children and twentyIwo slaves down the tortuously winding Mississippi south of New Orleans . Pasengers marveled as they crept past beautiful moss-hung plantations of the lesser rt , for as a deckhand explained : If'n they got money , they has a plantation ve New Orleans , not below . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as travelers prayed for some vagrant breeze to slip in from the Gulf of Rico . Entire sections of land became swamps inhabited only by birds and igators , swamps interminable , until at last the steamboat reached the strangest ination of any of the world 's major rivers : a bewildering morass of passes king the Gulf , of blind alleys leading only to more swampland . Often it was possible to determine whether the area ahead was fresh-water river , or saltter Gulf , or firm land , or simply more weed-grown swamp .  | How can he tell his way ? ' Otto asked one of the deckhands . By smell . ' The answer was not entirely frivolous , for as the great river died , the smell o the vast , free Gulf intruded , and soon Otto himself could detect the larger body o water . As soon as the vessel waiting in the Gulf became aware of the approachin steamer , its captain fired a small cannon to signify that all was in readiness , an Otto , seeing for the first time an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Th last days had been a journey through a primeval wonderland , more challenging far than that along the river to the north of New Orleans , and to see the sloo Carthaginian waiting motionless at the end of the passage was like seeing a lig in the forest .

' and travelers who had hoped to make that important landing cheere Fare to Texas would be twenty-one dollars total , five paid to the steamboat , sixt to the sail-borne sloop . But no transfer from one craft to another was ever mad easily , no matter how gentle the sea , and now when the steamboat dipped slightl the sloop lifted , and contrariwise . Shins were barked and baggage imperiled , b finally the adults were safe aboard the vessel , the children could be handed acro and the slaves were able to follow .

And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger having only the slightest comprehension of their destination . We 're making for Galveston , ' an officer explained , but if the weather 's bad , may have to put in at Matagorda Bay . ' Galveston was some four hundred miles , almost due west , and since there was sharp breeze from the southeast , the ship could make four knots , or about ot hundred and ten land miles a day . The trip wo n't require more than four days , the officer assured the passengers , and I doubt that it will be rough . ' Otto loved the swaying of the ship , and whereas some of the passengers expe enced a slight seasickness , he roamed everywhere and ate large quantities everything . It was a holiday for him , but some of the travelers were agitated by t uncertainty of destination : We hoped to put in at Matagorda . Our people there .

This is a mighty tough coast , as you 'll see , but one worry we do n't have . They ai n't no beetlin ' rocks stacked ashore . And they ai n't none hidin ' submerged to rip out your bottom . Anythin ' you hit is soft sand . ' But he returned a few minutes later with a correction : Of course , most of the wrecks you 'll see did just that . They hit soft sand , held fast , and then turned over . ' Otto noticed that he never said what happened to the passengers . But as the Carthaginian neared Galveston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northerly wind blew out from shore , creating such large waves that as the son sank , the captain had to announce : ' Waves get that high , takes them days to subside . ' Ca n't we push through ? ' asked a man whose home ashore was almost visible . Look at the last ship that tried , ' the captain replied , and off to starboard , rocking back and forth in the grasping sands , a sailing ship of some size was slowly being broken to pieces . On her stern Otto read : SKYLARK NEW ORLEANS . It 'll have to be Matagorda Bay , ' the captain said , and only a few daring souls whose hearts had been set on Galveston demurred , for the others realized that any attempt to land there would be suicidal . That night , as the ship made its way southwest through calmer seas to the alternate landing , Otto remained topside , running with his dog along the deserted decks , while his father and Zave Campbell remained below at their evening meal . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lingered in a corner of the cabin , piecing together a rough assessment of their fellow passengers : Twenty-three families , but only seven wives . What happened to the other sixteen ? Did they all die ? ' Texas is a great land , I 'm sure . It 's got ever'thin ' a man might want ? free land , free cattle , beautiful rivers , and mountains too , I hear , in the west . But one thing it ai n't got is a safe harbor . None . It has fine big bays , best in the world . Galveston , Matagorda , Corpus , Laguna Madre . I been in ' em all , and they ai n't none better . Only one thing wrong with ' em . No way you can get into ' em . God made Hisse'f these perfect bays , then guarded them with strings of sandbars , halfassed islands , marshes , and ever ' other kind of impediment you could imagine .

Next steamboat , went aground , and you 'll see it rottin ' there if'n we 're driven to Matagorda . The coast of Texas is hell in salt water . '  | Not at all . The twenty-three men represented a true cross section of those coming into Texas at this time . Seven were married and with their wives along ; four were legitimate widowers eager to launch new lives ; three had never bee married and looked forward to finding women in Texas , American or Mexican n matter . The nine wandering men like Macnab had left wives either abandoned permanently or clinging to some vague promise : If things work out well , I 'll send for you and the kids . ' Few were likely to do so . Curiously , four of these iron-souled wife-deserters had , like Macnab , brough their sons along  --  one man from Kentucky with two  --  but none had brought daughters , and few would ever see them again . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On one thing I seem to have been dead wrong , ' Macnab confided . ' I wrote td Austin asking if most of the newcomers were criminals escaping jail back eas , . From what I can judge , there is n't a criminal in the lot . ' I would n't trust my money with that tall fellow from Tennessee , ' Campbe said . Macnab was correct in his guess , Campbell wrong in his . Among these me. there was not one criminal , not one who had had to leave Connecticut or Ken tucky under even a minor cloud . They may have been men who had fail ? emotionally with their wives and families , but they had not otherwise failed citizens . The popular canard that everyone who headed for the wild freedom o Texas did so because the sheriff was in pursuit was disproved , at least by t sampling . In fact , among the twenty-three , there were not even any who had suffered major financial loss that might have propelled them outward from their socie Most of them had actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their abandoned wives in rather gratifying security : You can have the sto and the fields , Emma . I 'll not be needin ' them . ' Macnab chuckled when he thought of his own case , and Campbell askei What you laughin ' about ? ' Leaving Baltimore . I did n't steal their damned cattle . ' Nobody here said you did . ' I just sold them . They got a fair profit . ' When Macnab thought of his wife , Berthe , and her sniveling brothers h considered himself luckier than most to have escaped , and he would never haV conceded that he had in any way been forced out of Maryland : Tell you the tru Zave , I left her a lot better off than when I met her . She and the girls will have n trouble . ' Campbell summarized it well : We ai n't fleein ' from nothin ' . We 're fleein toward freedom . ' And Macnab added : Those two over there , who stay togethe all the time . I 'd say they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? ' Zave asked , and Macnab explained : Their docto  | warned them : " You stay in this city two more years , you 'll be dead of tuberculosis . Go to Texas . Let your lungs heal themselves in that good , dry air . " ' Now the two men tried to tot up the educational background of the passengers , and they found out that of the twenty-three men , twenty-one could read and write , and of these , fourteen had completed academy or high school and had some knowledge of Latin , Euclid and world history . Probing further , Macnab came up with some even more surprising information : ' Did you know , Zave , that six of those men over there have been to colleges like Yale and Transylvania ? I know that those two by the door studied law , they said so , and that short fellow who talks so much has a law degree from Virginia .

Two other things Macnab and Campbell could not know that autumn day in 1831 : four passengers were keeping journals  --  two men , two women  --  which would in later years prove invaluable ; and of the men , eighteen would soon be serving in battles of one kind or another against Mexico , and of these , seven would become senior officers . On the most important question of all  --  the possibility of revolution against Mexico  --  the two men had no opinion whatever . Few members of this group openly espoused such action ; some had vague expectations that Texas would eventually , by means not yet determined , free herself from Mexican control , but they certainly did not come expecting to incite rebellion , as would their successors in 1835 and 1836 . This sample of immigrants came primarily in search of free land and a fresh beginning . For example , Macnab and Campbell entered Texas honestly , without the slightest intention of causing trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled , they would find it impossible to accept the systems of government , law and society which their new homeland , Mexico , was painfully trying to establish . As the two men concluded their assessment , Macnab said : ' I do believe you 're the only Catholic in the group , ' to which Zave replied : ' From what I hear , you 'll all be joinin ' me within the week . If you want land . ' There was another factor which differentiated the group , as Campbell pointed out : ' Northern , against slavery but quiet about it , maybe nine . Southern , for slavery and ready to fight if you speak against it , maybe fourteen . ' Macnab volunteered two final guesses : ' Every man who can read , save you and me , Zave , has brought his quota of books , and all but one seems to be fond of strong drink . ' The abstemious one was Campbell , who explained in a loud voice : ' I used to love it too much . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers . And if I got started again , I 'd be as bad as an Irishman . ' The cabin laughed at this , for all could appreciate its relevance : of this contingent of thirty  | adults , all but Campbell had reached America after family affiliation with the Protestants of Northern Ireland . They were Scots-Irish , the whole cantankerous bundle of them , with all the turbulent , wonderful capabilities that the name implied . Following these ruminations , Macnab went on deck to be with his son as Otto peered into the darkness , hoping for a glimpse of the long sand finger which delineated Matagorda Bay . He had been there only a few moments when a commotion erupted in the cabin , and when voices rose and oaths reverberated , he hurried back to find a gentleman from Alabama shouting : Why ca n't Mexico ever do anything right ? Why did n't they tell us ? ' Now , now , Templeton ! The solution is an easy one . ' Not if they propose to deprive me of my property . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why were n't we told ? ' the Alabama man shouted , and Finlay wondered what could threaten him half as much as the danger which hung over the Macnabs : the loss of their entire investment . What you do , Templeton , is what we 've all done , ' But why were n't we warned ? ' In a new land , you learn one thing at a time . Now you 're learning that Mexican law absolutely forbids slavery and outlaws the importation of any slave . ' Damned good law , ' a man from the North growled , but softly enough so that Templeton did not hear . That outraged gentleman asked : If niggers are outlawed , how are you bringing yours in ? ' By the simple tactic we all use to import our property , ' the conciliator said , and he spread upon the cabin table a set of papers , carefully drawn , which both ' amazed and delighted the man from Alabama : Capital ! Can I do this ? ' We 've all done it , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that banned slavery throughout Mexico on pain of severe punishment  --  and Mexico was one of the first nations to enact such a law  --  the Southerners had devised a foolproof tactic , and Mr. Templeton now put it into effect . Carefully copying the documents laid before him , he penned seven forms replete with legal language , then summoned his seven slaves , but the captain of the sloop warned : We allow no niggers in the cabin , ' so he went on deck , where he collected his slaves , handed : p each in turn a pen , and commanded him or her to make a mark signifying acceptance of the terms spelled out in the paper : Being a free man/woman , of my own free will and determination I do hereby indenture myself to Mr. Owen Templeton , formerly of Tarsus , Alabama , for a term of ninety-and-nine years , and do further promise to obey his stipulations on the terms hereby agreed to and for the wages set  | between us until such time as my indenture is discharged . Obijah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , 16 October 1831 . Each of the Templeton slaves stepped forward and bound himself or herself for this term of ninety-nine years , the period settled upon decades earlier when a Mississippi judge handed down the opinion that if an indenture ran for more than that period , it would be unreasonable . The passengers slept fitfully that night , and long before daybreak , Otto was back on watch . As black shaded into gray , and gray into a pale rose , the boy peered intently toward the west , and before the others were awake he started shouting : Land ! Land ! ' Then everyone , free and slave alike , hurried to the railing to see their new homeland looming out of the morning mists , and they were struck silent by the sight before them . The Carthaginian had made landfall opposite a finger of land no more than fifteen inches above the surface of the water and of no useful purpose whatever . There was not a single dwelling , not a tree , not a rock , not a person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes moved softly in the breeze , but the grass , which had to fight salt air , was not nutritious , so none of the famed wild cattle of Texas roamed it . Desolate , windblown , inhospitable , the great sandbars of Texas served only to keep ships from shore and would-be settlers from t heir homes . The land was flat , not piled in interesting dunes as on other shorelines of the world , and beyond it the great bays it enclosed were also flat , not etched in leaping waves , and beyond the bays , when the eye could see so far , the mainland itself was utterly flat , with never a tree or a rise or a real hill visible anywhere . It was a land of sheer emptiness and as forbidding as any which had ever rebuffed a group of incoming settlers . Look ! ' Mr. Templeton of Alabama cried . A bird ! ' And all eyes turned to watch this precious creature , this one proof that life could be sustained in Texas , as it flew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned by the terrible loneliness of his new home , watched the bird for a long time , and it was he who first sighted the tree . Far down on another sandbar , its crown almost blending with the sea , rose one solitary tree . Of the millions of seeds which through the generations had fallen on this desolate spot , this one seed had attached itself to some brief accumulation of nourishing soil and had survived , withstanding wind and storm as if it wished to br a hopeful signal to those like the Macnabs and their friends who would later approach by sea . There was no entrance into the bay where the tree stood , and no passage anywhere in its vicinity , but the tree was more appreciated that morning than a lighthouse , and the immigrants watched it with relief and affection , for it was the only familiar sight to welcome them to their land of freedom .  | The Carthaginian spent most of that day working its way through the perilous entrance to Matagorda , and as predicted , the passengers saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they would have been at Hatteras or Cape Cod , but small sailing ships first trapped in sand , then turned over on their beam ends by succeeding waves , immobilized and knocked to pieces by the sea . In late afternoon the sloop was safely inside the reef , with passengers cheering the cleverness of their captain , but now many hours of sailing to the west still lay before them , for the bay was vast . It was next morning before land was finally reached at the new town of Linnville , where Mexican port authorities waited . Linnville consisted of three wooden shacks , hastily thrown together , with chinks big enough for a hand to reach through . One of the houses served as a store , but its surly proprietor , an American down on his luck , could offer only strips of sun-baked beef , two flitches of bacon , some rope , some nails and a jar of sugar candies . Indeed , he was much more interest in buying things from the newcomers than in selling to them , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mexican authorities occupied the other two houses , and they were even more surly than the storekeeper . A Mexican law passed the previous year had banned all immigration from the United States , for the danger of unlimited influx was appreciated . But because of his enthusiastic adherence to Mexico , Stephen Austin had been exempted ; he was permitted to bring in a few selected settlers , st grudgingly the customs officers had admitted the white arrivals but turned away the blacks . Then agitated Southerners cried : They 're not slaves ! They 're free men indentured for a few years . ' And when Stephen Austin himself supported thi interpretation , they were accepted . Each newcomer was asked if he had been born a Catholic , and since the greate part had reached America via Northern Ireland , only Zave Campbell could clain right of entry , which was quickly promised : The alcalde in Victoria will give yoi papers . ' The Protestants must report to the same official : He 'll arrange for th+ Catholic padres to supervise your conversions . ' When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper that testified to his ownership of land , they guffawed , for during the pas two years they had seen many such worthless certificates : Nada , senor , nada . ' And other Mexicans crowded about the table to laugh and assure the yanqui that hi paper really was nothing : Es nada , senor . Es absolutamente nada . ' One of th4 officials was about to tear it up , but Macnab rescued it , thinking to proffer it Victoria as proof of his honest intentions . Otto enjoyed the tedious walk to Victoria , but no one else did ; he marked tha soft variations in the flat wasteland : Look how that shrub stays protected behind the little rise of sand ! ' He was delighted by the way deer traveled parallel to th  | immigrants , always at a safe distance , and twice he saw wild horses , those small mustangs that could run with such impetuosity . On instructions from his father , he kept constant watch for that first line of trees which would mark where men could live and farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said . ' And so lonely . Is all of Texas . . . ? ' He did not finish his question , for his father was obviously distressed by this terrible bleakness , this endless sea of softly waving grass : ' And now look at that storm ! ' Big Zave , staring at the ominous black clouds sweeping in from the west , growled : ' So this is the land of milk and honey they told us about . I do n't even see one bee , let alone a cow . ' ' Otto ! ' Finlay called out . ' Cover yourself with a blanket . We 're to be soaked . ' Across that endless , unrelieved grassland came a tumultuous rainstorm , immense sheets of dark and splashing water which drenched them until the two men groaned , but Otto , keeping his eyes to the ground , saw that hiding beneath the grass were hundreds upon hundreds of lovely autumn flowers : blue , white , golden yellow , fiery orange , the brightest red . ' Look ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspect the watery garden he had discovered . Soon the storm passed overhead , allowing the sun to reappear above the western horizon . When the travelers wiped the water from their faces they saw , hanging in the eastern sky , a perfect rainbow , a grand multicolored arc which they could almost reach out and touch . ' Look ! ' Otto cried . ' We 're going to walk right into it . ' Upon a bed of flowers , with the sky ablaze about them , they walked into the Texas they had dreamed of , until even Zave was awed by the beauty : ' Maybe the Mexicans do n't welcome us , Otto , but the land sure does . ' In Victoria the Macnabs learned two things : ' This town and everything as far as you can travel . . . it all belongs to the De Leons . Spanish only spoken here . So you become full Mexican or you perish . ' The other bit of knowledge disturbed Finlay equally : ' Senor Macnab , I speak little English , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . long walk to the mission , many times , many questions . Very severe , ' and the speaker pounded his fist into his hand . Then he wiled : ' But at Quimper 's Ferry . . . maybe you catch Father Clooney if he 's out d ( jail . He make you Catholic . Very nice . . . very sweet man . ' Mexican officials quickly satisfied Macnab that his scrip was worthless , but they displayed none of the harshness he had encountered in the first office at the shore . ' Senor Macnab , ' said an officer who spoke English elegantly , ' we want American Milers . That is , if you build your house at least ten leagues inland from the sea . Slpecially we want fine lads like your son . So you are welcome to apply in the Ngular fashion , but only if you 've converted to our faith . Then you pay only a loudest amount for your land . Stamped paper , two dollars . My commissioner 's fee , eniecn dollars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fee ,  | which can not exceed one hundred and fifty dollars . We want you , but only on our terms . ' Ironically , Zave Campbell received entitlement to his land within half an hour of registering , for he had cleverly brought with him testimonials from two Catholic priests , one who had been doing missionary work among the derelicts of Under-the-Hill , one a cleric in New Orleans well regarded by the Mexican authorities . Zave did not receive a specific allocation ; he would be free to choose that later , but he did now possess an impressive document which permitted him to choose his quarter-league , about a thousand acres , from whatever lands in De Leon 's tract had not already been bespoken . The problem now arose as to where Zave should claim his land , but Macnab prevailed upon him to delay the selection until he , Finlay , could get to Quimper 's Ferry and make himself eligible through conversion ; then they could choose together . Campbell , however , was hungry for his entitlement and would have designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that he discovered an alluring technicality : Finlay , did you hear what they said at the alcalde 's ? I have my quarter-league , but I can have a whole league-and-a-labor if I find me ai Mexican wife . Nearly five thousand acres . You go to Quimper 's . I 'll look aroundl here . ' For land ? ' ' No , for a wife . ' So the Macnabs , with their dog Betsy , moved northeast through land that began to look as if it might be tillable , and the more they saw of the terrain th more eager they became to get their share . Now there was a slight roll to th prairies , a differentiation between this good area and that ; there were trees , t not noble ones like those in Ohio , but real trees nevertheless . Wild horses they sa frequently , and on two occasions they spotted large herds of cattle , lean , ran beasts with enormous horns , waiting , it seemed , for someone to claim them . was a rich , varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stranger than th bottomlands bordering some insignificant stream where towering canebrakes , wild growth much like sugarcane but worthless , grew in such tangled profusio that earlier travelers had been required to hack tunnels through them . To enter such a dark passageway , with the path scarcely wide enough for one t move , and to see the cane tops meeting in an archway far above the head w tedious for Finlay , delightful for Otto : It 's a dungeon , Poppa ! We 're going to meet the dragon , like the King of Crete . ' Freed at last of the brakes , they intercepted the Brazos River some miles down stream from Quimper 's Ferry , and even this far inland the stream gave the impr sion of being navigable for another hundred miles , but when Finlay looked mo closely he saw it to be clogged with sunken trees and jagged stumps that prohibited vessels . Seeking always to instruct his son in the necessary arts , he asked : How wide is the river ? ' and Otto guessed : Maybe three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how wide , ' and to the boy 's delight he explained : ' All a surveyor needs is three trees , A , B and C. A is that one on the far bank which you ca n't get to , B is here on this bank . Now find C along there that makes a right angle with B and an angle of forty-five degrees with A. ' Next he showed his son how , by folding a piece of paper , he could accurately determine each angle . When this disposition was laid out , he revealed the secret : ' Then all you do is step off the distance from B to C on this bank , and you have the exact distance from B across the river to A. ' He encouraged his son to measure the distance , and Otto said : ' Four hundred and twenty-nine feet . That 's a big river . ' ' And not too deep at this point . ' The essence of this vast land was beginning to seep into their souls , as it did with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that night Otto reported to his father : ' When I was little I wanted to be a boatman on the Mississippi . Now I want to live in Texas . ' ' So do I , ' his father said , and that night they slept with deep contentment . They were wakened in the morning by loud barking from Betsy , who was nipping at the heels of a brash young man heading upriver with two bundles slung across his back . The first contained clothing , the second the awkward tools of a blacksmith , and it seemed likely that these parcels represented a lifetime 's accumulation . He said : ' Isaac Yarrow , renegade from North Carolina , with a brief halt in Tennessee . ' When Finlay asked ' Where are you going ? ' the young man spat and growled : ' Got thrown out of San Felipe de Austin ... ' ' Is n't that the capital of these parts ? ' ' It is , and a sorrier spot God never made . Thirty-nine houses , six criminals to a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed robbery , seduction or murder . The alcalde drifted into town smellin ' distinctly of tar and feathers , and the esteemed sheriff still has four different wives in four different states , none dismissed by divorce . ' This evaluation was so contrary to the one Macnab had made in the Carthaginian that he had to protest : ' The immigrants we sailed with were n't like that , not at all . ' ' You saw the goods . I saw the bads . ' ' You 're telling the truth ? ' ' Texas is a magnet for criminals . ' ' If it 's that bad , what did you have to do to get thrown out ? ' Yarrow leaned against a live oak and scratched his head : ' They brought seven counts agin ' me . Mostly I was too outspoken and too blasphemous . ' ' Where you heading ? ' ' Seems like anyone with spirit who comes to Texas moves on to somewheres  | else . Missouri , Arkansas . Me , I 'm headin ' for California . Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live decent in Texas , ' Finlay said , and Yarrow growled : If you want to kiss ass . I never cared for that . ' They joined forces for the short journey to Quimper 's Ferry , and when they sighted the sturdy dog-run which served as inn , Yarrow grew rhapsodic : Now , if all people in Texas was like Mattie Quimper , this place would be a hard-workin ' paradise . ' When Finlay asked who Mattie was , Yarrow said : If she was twenty years younger , I 'd marry her . ' But what 's she do ? ' She runs the ferry . She runs the inn . And she befriends people like me who 've been kicked out of other places . ' As they approached the inn , Yarrow bellowed : Hey , Mattie ! ' and to the porch of the dog-run came a gray-haired woman in her forties , lean and worn from incessant labor . As she peered to see who was shouting , a young man of nineteen joined her , but remained slightly behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , it 's Isaac ! ' the woman called , and with a spry leap from the porch on which two travelers were asleep in their blankets , she ran to the blacksmith and kissed him . They tell me you 've been in trouble down to San Felipe . ' Got run out of town . They said " You 've got twenty-four hours to git , " and I shouted back " I 'll live to see grass growin ' in your goddamned streets . " ' Sshhh , ' Mattie whispered . We got clergy inside . ' Father Clooney ? ' Yarrow cried with obvious enthusiasm . Did he get out of jail ? ' No , sad to say , ' Mattie reported . They sent officers from Saltillo to arrest him . Charged him with bein ' too partial to the norteamericanos . ' How long 's he been in chains ? ' They did n't chain him . Not after the first month . But he 's been in jail a year . Miracle he ai n't dead . ' So who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat : That sanctimonious .. With a quick swipe of her hand , Manic slapped the blacksmith on the cheek : You shut up ! Reverend Harrison has come down to see if I 'll marry him . ' Yarrow caught Mattie in his arms and gave her a little waltz , feet off the ground . Mattie , old girl ! You do n't have to waste yourself on that Psalm-singer . I 'll stay here and run the ferry for you . ' Were n't you run out of the whole Austin grant ? ' she asked , and Yarrow replied : I was . But 1 'd stay here and protect you from Reverend Harrison . ' He spoke the name with such disgust that the two Macnabs supposed the clergyman to be an  | ogre , but when he walked out the door onto the porch , gingerly avoiding the sleeping men , they were surprised by his commanding appearance . Isaac ! ' he said with unfeigned cordiality . What evil are you up to now ? ' You 'll be gratified to learn that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felipe . ' High time , ' Harrison said , stepping down and throwing his right arm about Yarrow in a brotherly embrace . We welcome you here , but we 're going to watch you . . . most carefully . ' I 'm on my way to California . Just stopped off to warn Mattie Quimper not to marry you . ' Harrison laughed : Bad men flee to Texas . Always have . And the worst move on to California . Always will . ' Mattie , who continued her work as if the marriage under discussion involved someone fifty miles away , invited Yarrow and the Macnabs into the inn for breakfast , and when eggs , bear strips and pecans were on the table she asked Harrison if he would say grace , and the tall , forbidding man asked the others to bow their heads while he raised his face toward heaven : Almighty Father , watch over Thy renegade son Isaac as he heads for California . And welcome to Thy bosom the strangers who join us this day . Protect Mattie who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thy true religion can be preached openly in these parts . Amen . ' When heads were raised , he placed his hand on young Otto 's arm and said : They have n't told me your name . ' Otto , and this is my father , Finlay Macnab of Baltimore . ' Someone has taught you manners , young man . ' Then he smiled at Finlay , asking : What brings you to these parts ? ' and Macnab said : Freedom : You 'll be welcomed here . What church ? ' Presbyterian . Many generations in Scotland and Ireland . ' One of God 's chosen religions , ' Harrison said . Here we 're all Methodists . ' Not me , ' Yarrow interrupted , at which Harrison warned : God has His eye on you , Isaac , and so do I. ' What 's this about a marriage ? ' the blacksmith asked , and Harrison said , blushing : I had not supposed that so delicate a matter would be discussed publicly , ' and Yarrow replied : ' If a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecherous old clergyman like you , Harrison , it should become public . ' She needs a man to help her , ' Harrison said with real tenderness as he watched Mattie moving about the kitchen . Smoothing down her apron , she lifted a flat metal slab from the fire and brought to the table her latest batch of salt-and-honey pecans , which she placed before Otto . Let ' em cool . Then eat up , ' she said . She offered Finlay some and invited Yarrow to sample them , but she took pains to see that when the slab came to rest , it was before Reverend Harrison .  | Now tell me , ' she said , what brings you to the Ferry , Mr. Macnab ? ' Finlay was too embarrassed to reveal his secret , especially since a Methodist minister looked on , but Mattic could guess : You hoped that Father Clooney would be here , did n't you ? You want to convert so you can obtain land ? ' At this blunt disclosure of his plans , Finlay began to stammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said openly : Zave Campbell , he 's already Catholic , with papers from two different priests proving it , and he got his land right away . And if he can find a Mexican lady to marry , he 'll get four times as much . ' To the surprise of the two Macnabs and Yarrow , but not to Mattie , for she now knew Reverend Harrison well and favorably , the austere Methodist said : Have no embarrassment , Macnab . It 's an immoral law and to obtain your land it 's quite forgivable to subvert it . Swear allegiance to the Pope but remain Presbyterian in your heart . ' Is that your counsel ? ' Macnab asked , and Harrison said : I give it constantly . And do you know why ? Because within five years at the most , Texas is going to break away from Mexico . And we can all worship as God wants us to , in His churches . ' Yarrow interrupted : You 're convinced God is a Methodist ? ' and Harrison shot back : He certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Testament says he is , ' Harrison growled : That 's your interpretation . ' Then he changed his tenor completely : Isaac , return to San Felipe . Make peace with the officials . Because when war comes we 'll need men like you . ' I gave Texas its chance . And it rejected me . I 'm for California . ' The newcomers spent three enjoyable days at Quimper 's , talking about the future , teasing Reverend Harrison about his courtship , and stuffing themselves with Mattie 's good food . Harrison was certain that revolution of some kind was inevitable ; Yarrow doubted that weaklings like Stephen Austin would ever muster courage for such an act ; and Finlay Macnab was startled by the frankness of the speculation : I thought everyone agreed that Texas was to remain Mexican . Austin said so in his letter to me , ' and he produced that document . When Yarrow finished reading it he said : The epistle of a weakling , ' and when Harrison took the letter he said : He 's masking his true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yarrow asked boldly : Harrison , why do you insist that Mattie needs your help when she has this fine son who could run things better than you ever would ? ' and Harrison replied : She 'll be in real trouble if she relies on that one . ' Yarrow and Macnab had been studying young Yancey , and the more they saw of him the more they agreed that the flabby lad needed some strong influence to force him into Texas ways . He 's just not Texican , ' Yarrow said . He 'd get along fine in Virginia , or even better in Massachusetts , where they do n't have such high standards for manliness . But in this climate I fear for him . ' What the two men disliked about Yancey was the latter 's unwillingness , or  | inability , to take charge of the inn and the ferry . ' No woman should be doin ' the work Mattie does , ' Yarrow said , and one afternoon he grudgingly told Harrison : ' It could be a proper move , Reverend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? ' ' I 'm a year older than she is . Lost my wife to the cholera . ' ' In principle I still oppose the marriage , ' Yarrow said , ' but in practice . ' How old are you ? ' Harrison asked , not belligerently , and Isaac replied : ' Very old in the ways of the world , and I can see through you . What you want is that ferry . You know it 's a gold mine . ' ' What I want , ' Harrison said , ' is a free Texas . Stay and help us win it . ' But Yarrow , one of the best men to emigrate to Texas during these turbulent years , had seen enough of it . The good men like Austin lacked courage and the bad ones , like the fugitive murderers and embezzlers at San Felipe , lacked judgment . He could see no hope for the colony but he did foresee a kind of permanent tension between Mexico and the United States . He concluded that the best chance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on a bright morning in January he bade the residents at Quimper 's farewell , shouldered his two packs , and headed west . That afternoon , when all were still lamenting his absence , Yancey Quimper shouted from the porch where he was resting : ' Mom ! Here he is ! ' and the Macnabs assumed it was Yarrow , changing his mind . Instead , it was a bent old man , Father Clooney , now sixty-seven but looking much older because of his stay in the Mexican prison . ' Good God ! ' Mattie cried as she ran to him . ' What did they do to you ? ' He was limping so badly that he had to be helped by two young priests , who explained : ' The new governor pardoned him . He was supposed to find refuge in Zacatecas with the Franciscans , but he insisted on coming back to his old parish , and here he is . ' ' Will you stay with him ? ' Mattie asked as she helped him onto the porch . ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning we move on . ' The three clerics slept that night on the porch ; Mattie offered Father Clooney a bed , but he said : ' I 'll stay with me lads this last night , ' and in the morning he blessed them as they started for the remotest outpost of the Mexican empire : ' You 'll like it up there , lads . Good people and souls to be saved . ' As they departed be stood with Mattie , watching as Finlay Macnab poled the ferry across the Brazos : ' How wonderful it must be for them , Mattie . To be young , facing a new world , and knowing there 's chapels to be built and pagans to be saved . ' lie was not at the inn three days  --  painful days of recuperation from his travail ? before couples started arriving to have their informal marriages solemnized , end now Reverend Harrison felt it obligatory to withdraw . ' No need , ' Father Money said , ' I 'm sure they 'd appreciate your blessing too , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself : ' You speak kindly to a Methodist , and the Mexicans 'll throw you back in jail . ' ' I think they 'll let me run my course , ' Clooney said as he wearily prepared for the weddings .  |  He was a tired old man now , worn out by the race of life . He had seen enough of frontier living  --  especially the hideous wars with Indians when each side tried to demonstrate its superior claim to savagery , and the petty rebellions , with fifteen Mexicans dead and sixteen Americans-to know that man was a frail creature who lived on this earth but briefly , and rarely well . A good horse , a reliable woman , sons to protect the old age , and enough to eat , that was the best man could hope for , and if perchance he heard far echoes of God and Jesus , never seen but surely there , so much the better . Life , ' he told Mattie one evening , ' is a whole lot better if you have reassurances . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was especially fond of white bread smeared with butter , but flour was so rare in Texas that he had sometimes gone for a whole year without tasting bread : ' A hunk of meat , two Mexican flapjacks made of corn , and now and then a beer , that 's my penance for having left those fine cooks in Ireland . ' Having lived in four different lands  --  Ireland , England and Louisiana , briefly , and Mexico  --  it was his measured judgment that Texas cooking was the worst in the world : But I eat enough of it to keep me belly fat , and I do believe that when I die the table set in heaven will be a mite bit better . ' He rose at dawn on the wedding day to take breakfast with Mattie , who asked him : Should I marry Reverend Harrison ? ' and he advised her : ' If ever a woman sees a reasonably good man , take him . ' She then asked if he considered Harrison good man , and he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of revolution . Does one destroy the other ? I do n't know . ' She asked if he thought the revolution which Harrison preached would materialize , and he said : ' A year of jail knocks desire for revolution out of a man . ' Then suddenly he dropped his weary head on the table , and for a moment sh . thought he was weeping , but when he lifted his face he was smiling : ' I 'm ashamed , Mattie . I 'm covered with disgrace . ' Why ? Jail is forgivable when you go there for the reasons you did . ' ' Oh , jail has nothin ' to do with it . But recently I 've caught myself thinkin ' " I hope it all hangs together for the rest of my life , then to hell with it . " What shameful surrender . ' He studied her across the rough wooden breakfast table , thconfessed : Harrison is the voice of the future . I 'm the past . ' Now tears did corn to his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , I wrecked me parish I Here , I converted never an Indian . In Mexico , I wound up in jail . And the years have fled so swiftly . ' Mattie rose and went about her duties , leaving him there , and after a while h. , went onto the porch , where he supervised the placement of the rude altar fro i which he would preach to the seven couples . When this was completed he re turned to the doorway , looked in at Mattie , and said , his face beaming with love for the old days : ' Matt , old girl ! I do wish your husband and The Kronk were here this day . I miss them . '  | Marriage , to Father Clooney , remained the most sacred of rites , but when the ceremony was over he did enjoy a bit of celebration and was especially appreciative if it involved some warming spirits . That evening the dancing , the fiddle-playing and the shouting were lively , but next morning Clooney was up early , showing no signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seek conversion in order to grab a wee bit of land ? ' he asked as the day began , and when four families , including Macnab and his son , were lined up on the porch , he proceeded mechanically to make them technical Catholics . But if he took such political conversion lightly , Finlay could not , for when he stood next in line and realized that he must soon take a solemn oath abjuring John Knox 's religion for which his Highland ancestors had died rather than surrender it to the Pope , his knees began to shake , his throat went dry , and a crazed look came into his eye . He recalled those great battles in Northern Ireland between the Presbyterians and the papists , the centuries of struggle of which he had been a part , and he found himself powerless to move forward . Father Clooney had seen these symptoms before , always in people who had come to Texas via Northern Ireland , and in his compassion he made it easy for Finlay and Otto to step aside . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply too great , but that night Clooney talked with both father and son , for he insisted that Otto be present : I know well the torment you feel . I 've seen it before , and I respect you for your integrity . I can tell you only two things . My religion is one of the sweetest , gentlest in the world , a consolation and a redemption . I 've loved it for nearly seventy years , and when I die within its embrace I shall know no fear , for God has been with me always . The Mexican government , in its wisdom , has said that you can not have land unless you convert to the religion it sponsors . This is a clear law , not unreasonable , and not unfairly administered . So if you want land , you Macnabs , you must convert this day , for tomorrow I may be gone . Let me tell you this , my sons , to own land is a good thing , and if you find it in your hearts to join my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it 's a worthy home , one which assures you much benevolence . ' The old man did not go on to finish his statement , the implied part about what would happen if the Macnabs did not find their new religion congenial , and he certainly did not say that so far as he was concerned , once they got their land they were free to revert to Presbyterianism , but his entire manner implied that such was his belief . So Finlay and Otto became Catholics , trembling with fear lest they be struck  | dead for the blasphemy they were committing , but Father Clooney blessed them just the same and smiled at the heavy perspiration on Finlay 's forehead . That night Father Clooney slept on the porch as usual , but he was uneasy , and long after midnight he roused Finlay and sat with him by the flickering fire : ' My son , we must do something about getting you land . ' I 've converted . ' That may not be enough . Authorities have grown suspicious of Austin . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ? ' Forget Austin . Go back to Victoria and ask the De Leons for an assignment in their grant . ' Will they give it ? ' I know that family well . One of the best . 1 'll write them a letter recommending you . ' ' I 'd appreciate that . I 'll get it in the morning . ' To Macnab 's surprise , Father Clooney reached and grasped his hand as if he were responsible for his new convert 's welfare : ' No , we 'd better do it now . ' And taking paper from the same old Bible with which he had converted the Quimpers years before , he drafted a warm note to the De Leons , beseeching them to award land to his trusted friend Macnab . Handing Finlay the paper , he returned unsteadily to the porch . Sometime after dawn , as was her custom , Mattie went to him with a cup of broth , but when she tried to waken him he did not respond . For several terrifying moments she kept prodding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Then his left arm fell lifeless onto the boards of the porch and she could no longer ignore the evidence . She did not cry out , nor did she call for help . She merely looked down at the body of a man she had first suspected , then grown to love , a faithful shepherd whose flock had been so widely scattered that he had worn himself out tending it . As if his death had also terminated a portion of her life , she gave no further thought to the proposed marriage with Reverend Harrison . After the funeral , which the Methodist conducted with a glowing tribute to his onetime adversary , she sent him north , where he married a much younger widow , who helped him fan the fires of rebellion . Otto observed this tangled behavior of his elders  --  Isaac Yarrow 's bitter dismissal of Texas , Reverend Harrison 's erratic courtship , the willful return of Father Clooney to a parish in turmoil , the curious behavior of Yancey , ten years older than himself and therefore an adult in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  without understanding many of the actions or any of their motivations . But as the Macnabs were preparing to quit the inn and move south with their  | letter to the De Lebns in Victoria , an event occurred which he comprehended perfectly . From the opposite side of the Brazos , at eleven one bright morning , a loud halloo came ringing through the air , and Otto ran to see what traveler was coming south . To his delight , it was Benito Garza , the muleteer he had known in New Orleans , so without alerting Mattie he dashed to the beached ferry , jumped in and started poling across the river , shouting as he did : ' Benito ! It 's me ! Otto Macnab ! ' And as he neared the far shore Garza , standing with his two helpers , recognized the boy and shouted back : ' The little horseman ! Hooray ! ' and the two assistants added their ' Oles ! ' The three traders piled into the ferry , and Otto proudly escorted them across the river and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattie ! Strangers ! ' but when she came to the porch she deflated the boy : ' Garza ! We 've been friends for years . ' It was a lively reunion but also an emotional one , for after the noise and the embraces Garza almost shyly handed Mattie a present , and when she opened it to the applause of all , she found a bolt of English cloth and a simple dress made in France . They were the first such gifts she had ever received , and for a long time she was silent , then she said in a flat tone : ' You carried them a long way , Benito . ' Now everyone spoke at once , and Garza learned of Yarrow 's exile , Father Clooney 's death and the Macnabs ' conversion . He wanted to know where Zave Campbell had located his land , and Finlay explained : ' He has n't exactly chosen it yet , but he favors a stretch along the Guadalupe , ' and Garza approved : ' Any land washed by a river is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered : ' Fact is , he 's not looking for land . He 's looking for a wife . ' As Otto was talking , Benito was holding Mattie 's French dress against her spare form , but the boy 's words so startled him that he dropped the dress , left Mattie , and took Otto by the arm : ' What did you say ? ' ' He 's not really looking for his land . ' ' The other part . Is he looking for a wife ? ' ' Yes . He gets four times as much land if he finds one . ' It was then that Benito Garza 's maneuvering began . Sitting at the rough table and addressing all those in the kitchen , including two travelers who were eating , he said : ' We were nine children and the family had only one ranch along the Rio Grande . No chance for me to inherit the land , so I brought my two youngest haters with me to Victoria . I 'm head of the family . With some difficulty I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose Mardones , but he did n't last long . ' ' Did he run away ? ' Mattie asked , and he replied : ' No . He was shot . Stealing horses . . . from a norteamericano . ' Otto interrupted : ' You told me in New Orleans that horses ran free . ' ' Trained horses are different , ' Garza said . Then he addressed Finlay : ' So this  | wonderful woman , only thirty-one , still has no husband , and if Senor Campbell How about your younger sister ? ' Mattie asked , and he replied : Josefina ? She 's only twenty-six . She can wait . Always get your oldest sister married first . ' This perplexed Otto : But if they 're older than you , why do n't they find their own husbands ? ' and Garza replied with dignity : In a Mexican family it 's the father 's obligation . And I am their father , so to speak . ' Now Garza became zealous for an immediate return to Victoria : We 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so before the Macnabs were really ready to depart , Garza applied constant pressure for them to hurry : ' Everything is better for a norteamericano in Texas if he has a reliable Mexican wife . Suppose he wants land ? Suppose he gets into trouble with the alcalde ? Or if the priests act up ? ' He may already have found a wife . ' I hope not ! He would be throwing himself away if he did n't take Maria . I promise you , Senor Macnab , this woman is exceptional . A man finds a wife like her once in a hundred years . ' In the morning the Macnabs looked in surprise as Garza bent low over Mattie 's hands , kissing each in turn , and even Otto could see that the Mexican herdsman loved this rough woman who ran the ferry , and they treated him with more respect as they moved south toward Victoria . There Garza hurried ahead , shouting as he entered the town : Senor Campbell ! ' He located the big Kaintuck some distance to the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalupe , and his greeting was fervid : What fine land you 've chosen ! Have you found a wife ? ' When Zave said No , ' Garza gave an immense sigh , slumped to the earth beside Campbell , and said softly : Senor , I liked you from the minute I saw you in New Orleans . I could see then that you had character . Now let us all go back to Victoria so that Senor Finlay can present the papers given him by Father Clooney and claim his land . ' He did not mention his sisters . The De Leons accepted the recommendation of the revered priest , and after lamenting his death , they said : We welcome you to Victoria . Choose your land wisely . ' And it was then that Garza said almost casually : Since we 're all here , why do n't we go see my sisters ? ' but he could not help adding : Senor Campbell , I give you my word , you 're going to like Maria . ' He led the way to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as he approached it he started shouting : Maria ! I bring new friends ! ' and to the rough wooden doorway came an ample woman with a big warm face . When her dark eyes looked at the newcomers and her mouth broke into a smile of welcome , Otto knew immediately that he had found a replacement for his Baltimore mother , and as the days passed in her benign presence this feeling deepened , for Maria Garza Mardones was one of those women who embraced the world .  | Her laugh sounded like a deep-throated bell ; she was patient with the follies of men ; and she adored children , chickens , colts and hard work . The closing weeks of 1831 were memorable , because the Americans and the Garzas moved out to Campbell 's land and started building a dog-run . The three men chopped trees for the timbers while the two Garza women and Otto mixed mud and straw to make adobes . Since each person worked as if the resulting cabin was to be his or her own , the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen feet wide , and each of the two halves larger than the ones at Quimper 's Ferry . At the end of the first week the Macnabs were surprised to see that Campbell was driving stakes to outline a third room on the north . What 's that for ? ' Finlay asked , and Zave said : You and Otto . Till you get your own land and your own house . ' Otto , who had fallen in love with Maria , considered this an admirable decision , for he expected his friend Zave to marry the Mexican woman , and he was further pleased on Wednesday of the second week when Zave started driving even more makes for a fourth room , also on the north but well separated from the one intended for the Macnabs . What 's that one for ? ' Otto asked , and Zave said : Benito and his sister Josefina . They 're to be livin ' with us , too . ' Are you marrying Maria ? ' Otto asked , and when Zave answered : Yep , I cai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the boy rushed to the stalwart Mexican woman and began kissing her . So before the first room of the dog-run was even well started , Zave had planned what amounted to a frontier mansion , and that was the beginning of the good dines at Zave Campbell 's . What gave this particular house a touch of extra charm was its position near a solitary live oak festooned with Spanish moss , which meant that the tree provided both decoration and some protection against the sun . Also , a traditional long , low porch joined the two halves on the south side , but in this instance it also swung around to enclose the western end ; at close of day the occupants could rest there and watch the sun go down . Maria , once her marriage to Campbell was solemnized , showed great affection for Otto , and since she had reason to believe that she could have no children of her own , and the boy was so appreciative of anything she did for him , she considered him her son , and for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language but also the handling of cattle . Under Benito 's skilled tutelage he improved the shooting skills Zave Campbell had taught him on the Trace . But it was in horseback riding that he appreciated Benito most , for Garza was hot h patient and firm in teaching him the basics , and soon he had Otto galloping r the head of the file when the Mexican hands rode forth to round up mustangs . With Benito 's help he broke one for himself , a high-spirited little beast with a
