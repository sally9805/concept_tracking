In Texas , there is a hall of fame for just about everyone . The Texas Rangers have theirs in Waco , the cowgirls one in Hereford , and sports stars are memorialized in Arlington . Now there is also the Texas Business Hall of Fame . <P> Businessmen in Texas have always had an outsize impact , whether they were cattle ranchers , oil wildcatters or the modern-day bankers and real estate financiers . Says Scott Bennett , executive director of the Texas hall : " Business is a state religion in Texas . " The Hall of Fame is supposed to be its cathedral , but no permanent site has yet been selected . <P> Nonetheless , the organizers , a group of Texas business leaders , have already raised $200,000 for Hall of Fame programs . The nine inaugural Hall of Fame members include : two oilmen , W.D . Noel , founder of El Paso Products , and L.F. McCollum , former chairman of Continental Oil Co. ; Robert J. Kleberg Jr . of the King Ranch ; Jesse Jones , publisher , real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the New Deal ; J. Erik Jonsson , former head of Texas Instruments ; George and Herman Brown , who developed the giant Brown &; Root construction firm ; Retailer Charles Tandy of Tandy Corp. ; and Arthur Temple , who retired in January as chairman of Temple-Eastex and vice chairman of Time Inc . Three of the four living members , McCollum , Noel and Temple , attended ceremonies last week inaugurating the hall . <P> The Texas Business Hall of Fame screened a list of 200 potential candidates before coming up with the honorees . One rule is that hall members may not be actively involved in their businesses on a day-to-day basis . That excluded two of the state 's richest and best-known businessmen : Bunker and Herbert Hunt .
