No question . Surrounded by superstars , many of whom have eclipsed him in popularity and record sales , Bob Dylan looks as if he has been dealt out . <P> In the TV documentary that chronicles the creation of We Are the World , there is a general air of union and celebration , with Dylan hanging back from all the good-fellowship . Everyone is used to seeing Dylan as the selfexiled iconoclast , the hipster assassin , lurking darkly and waiting to wound . But here he seems different , like an expatriate who is not sure whether to travel on his own passport or sneak back into the country . He frets openly about performing his short solo . He needs coaching ; he needs confidence . And when he brings it off , finally  --  and beautifully  --  he gets a hug from Producer Quincy Jones . Dylan 's face breaks into a wide smile , grateful , relieved and unguarded . That session could not have been easy for him ; neither , one suspects , were these last years , looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Now there is a new album , his 23rd of original material , which will be available in stores this week . Empire Burlesque is full of turmoil and anger and mystery , an oblique diary of all this time just past . It is also a record of survival and a tentative kind of triumph . Maybe Bob Dylan got a little lost , but he never left the field . This album is hard evidence that he is ready to take the point again . <P> On Empire Burlesque , Dylan is in fine dramatic form : wrenching on ballads like I 'll Remember You , furious on Seeing the Real You at Last and spooky on When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky , one of those pacesetter Dylan songs in which romantic anguish kaleidoscopes into a sneak preview of Armageddon . The writing in the album is near peak . Tight Connection to My Heart is a playful bit of lovelorn apocrypha , a mood , once established , that turns sinister toward the end of the record , with the ominous Something 's Burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like one of those midnight Poe love poems , filled with grace notes that sound like cries for help ( " I live in another world where life and death are memorized. / Where the earth is strung with lovers ' pearls and all I see are dark eyes " ) , and images of fleeting beauty that turn into signs of prophecy ( " Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel " ) . <P> Nothing has calmed or settled , but the album 's ten songs , produced for the first time by Dylan himself and remixed by Arthur Baker , all have a tempered edge . Baker , who made himself a heavy reputation doing 12-in. dance remixes of songs by the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper , would seem at first glance to be Dylan 's way of catching up with what is supposed to be going down . Baker works the board in a recording studio like a virtuoso instrumentalist . He brings up the sound of some instruments , reduces others , sometimes adding electronic effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting grandiose . On Empire Burlesque , he gives subtle toning to Dylan 's new muscle . It is not a matter of bringing Dylan up to the minute , but giving him the room to make his own time .
