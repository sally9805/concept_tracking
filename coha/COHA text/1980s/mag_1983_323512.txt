THE TRANSFER by Thomas Palmer ; Ticknor &; Fields ; 402 pages ; $14.95 <P> Thrillers may borrow some tricks from detective stories and some atmosphere from spy fiction , but they are essentially different from both . Such works can trace their lineage directly back through the medieval romances to the classical epic and its archetypal plot : a hero risks his life trying to master overwhelming odds . Modern incarnations of this nonpareil ( out of , say , Raymond Chandler , Graham Greene or Robert Stone ) have become increasingly antiheroic , their designs questionable and their morality ambiguous . But the trials they must endure , the plot of their quests , remain much the same , as formal and stylized as kabuki or an Elizabethan sonnet . <P> The Transfer shows that Thomas Palmer , in his first novel , knows all the right moves . He offers a hero with a preposterous scheme and , for the reader 's benefit , a sidekick who must be told what is going on every step of the way . An innocent bystander , female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition forces are evil and apparently unbeatable . <P> Ray Hula , fat and fiftyish , owns a small marine salvage firm in Miami . Out of nowhere , he gets a phone call from his younger half brother , Michael Cruz . They have heretofore shared only a mother and mutual indifference ( Hula 's father was Polish , Cruz 's a Portuguese seaman ) . Now Cruz , a New York mobster , needs Hula 's help , offers him half a million dollars and threatens to destroy his business if he refuses . Hula does not . Cruz has somehow got hold of a ton of cocaine in Colombia and transported it to the Bahamas . A boat carrying this cache will approach Miami and run aground on a reef . Hula will be called by the port authorities , who trust him , to salvage the wreck and tow it in . The coke will be removed . Then Cruz will peddle it to the very gangsters from whom he stole it in the first place . <P> Once the cocaine is transferred to a van , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . I 'm glad it 's over . " Of course it is not done , either for Hula , Cruz , Wally Liberty ( the pilot of the boat ) or Hula 's girlfriend Lisa Bishop . It is bad enough that Arthur Rawden , a canny investigator for the Drug Enforcement Agency , has picked up their scent . It is worse that a mysterious bald man continues to stalk Cruz , threatening to kill him and his associates . Worst of all , some of the ablest hired guns on the East Coast have converged on Miami , with orders to pay Cruz $10 million for the dope and then kill him , preferably over a long , long period of time . <P> It is impossible to watch this plot unfold without rooting for the underdog and then remembering that Cruz is as bad as his pursuers , a wildcat crook with delusions of grandeur . Palmer does not blink at Cruz 's venomous ethics , but he sinks this character in a landscape of almost unrelieved corruption . He portrays a Miami and environs where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bludgeon hanging over the landscape , poised to smash whatever might attempt to set itself above the level , and nothing larger than a dragonfly dared to venture into its sight ; not from lassitude but out of a strict fear .
