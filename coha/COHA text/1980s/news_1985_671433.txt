The dollar ' s plunge today and Tuesday , following its leap to new records on Monday , has sent trading volume soaring on the Merc ' s International Monetary Market. // The market is a 13-year-old division of the Merc , where futures contracts for gold , 90-day Treasury bills and West German marks , British pounds , Japanese yen and Swiss and French francs are traded . In addition , the Merc trades option contracts on pounds , marks and Swiss francs. // The Merc is used by banks and others to hedge against currency fluctuations , and by speculators to bet on currency rises and falls . In 1984 , the Merc ' s 2 , 700 members traded 13. 8 million financial futures contracts , more than three times the 1980 level. // <> <> Traders Uncertain // But if the dollar ' s gyrations this week have meant more business for the exchange , they have also left speculative traders here both nervous and uncertain. // Between trades , the question on everybody ' s lips was whether the day they were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European currencies would bottom out and the dollar would turn downward. // " There have been about 40 false bottoms for the European currencies so far , and I ' m just hoping that this isn ' t number 41 , " said Manny A. Kravitz , president of a trading operation that bears his name , as he stood next to the German mark futures pit where more than 100 traders were screaming and hand signaling to each other in a frantic day . " There has been a feeling that enough is enough already with the dollar . It ' s an overdone cake. " // But despite the widely held view that the dollar is overvalued after five years of run-up , many traders here are still not willing to bet against the dollar . They fear that the European banks may , as before , soon stop their intervention and the dollar may , as before , resume its sharp climb. // <> <> Some See Major Shift // Nonetheless , the dollar ' s tumble this week was sizable enough for some traders to pronounce it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a run-up for the European currencies , " said John F. Sandner , president of Rufenacht Bromagen &; Hertz . " But we still have to see whether there will be a follow-through . We keep wondering whether this run-up is for real. " // A number of traders at the International Monetary Market thought on Tuesday that the West German mark , Swiss franc and other foreign currencies might have bottomed out . They speculated that testimony that day by Paul A. Volcker , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , before a House subcommittee was calculated to help stem the dollar ' s rise. // Mr. Volcker told Congress that foreign government intervention to slow the dollar ' s climb had not been forceful enough and that the Fed might not tighten the monetary supply - which would help increase interest rates and strengthen the dollar - even if economic growth is stronger than expected. // <> <> ' The Cheapest Way ' // " Volcker wanted to get the dollar back down , and his testimony didn ' t cost him a nickel to do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . " It was the cheapest way to get the dollar down - far cheaper than intervention in the currency markets. " // Mr. Mallon said the drop in the dollar on Tuesday and today was a technical correction " largely engineered by the Fed and the central banks . " He added that " they wanted to prove to people buying dollars that there ' s a risk in buying dollars . They ' ve eliminated the scared dollar bulls , but the underlying strength of the dollar is still there. " // Minutes after Mr. Volcker began testifying on Tuesday , traders and investors jumped over each other to get into the fray . Investors who were short on European currencies , that is , those who sold contracts expecting the currency to fall , rushed to cover themselves by buying contracts . At the same time , many traders and investors hurried to buy German mark and Swiss franc futures , as well as British pound and Canadian dollar futures , guessing that those currencies were finally bouncing off the bottom. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking for an opportunity to get into a market that has been downtrending , " said Richard J. Kapsch , E.F. Hutton ' s director of floor operations . Feeling the uncertainty that seems to pervade the frenetic trading floor , Mr. Kapsch added that the strengthening of the European currencies " was primarily a technical correction . Mr. Volcker ' s testimony was the catalyst. " // " The trading is very choppy because of all the uncertainty , " said William F. Davies , one of the scores of independent traders in the financial futures pits . Mr. Davies said he traded very tentatively today because he was so unsure of the dollar ' s direction , but lost $400 in some in-and- out trading in German mark futures . What upset him more , however , was his decision to sell off his Swiss franc and German mark futures contracts yesterday , instead of holding them overnight when their value soared. // On Tuesday , shortly after Mr. Volcker made his pronouncements , Mr. Davies was confident Eurocurrencies would jump , so he rushed to buy four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract represents 125 , 000 francs or marks . The Swiss franc has $2 , 000 margin reuirement ; the emark has a $1 , 500 requirement. a // Nevertheless , Mr. Davies was concerned that the run-up in the European currencies would be reversed . Thus , he sold the contracts 15 minutes after buying them - making a $1 , 200 profit . He said he bought the four March contracts for Swiss francs at . 3446 francs per dollar and sold them a few minutes later at . 3460. // " It ' s very risky for the small trader without much money in his pocket to hold contracts overnight because there can be such volatile overnight movements , " Mr. Davies said . Like many small traders , he complained that the independent trader often gets tossed about mercilessly by the heavy swings brought about by bank and institutional trades - both while the exchange is open and at night after it is closed. // " Traders are fearful now of overnight intervention , " said James W. Mulka , director of floor operations for Stotler &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the fundamentals. " // Mr. Mulka suggested that the dollar might just be catching its breath and might reach new highs because little has changed the fundamentals - the high interest rates and the strength of the American economy that have attracted the billions in foreign capital that have bid up the dollar. // Despite the widespread belief tht the dollar will climb again , many investors are hesitant to invest in dollars , that is , to go long in dollars . " It ' s hard to take a long position in dollars when you fear that the European central banks may spend billions more in intervention , " said Mr. Kapsch of E.F. Hutton. // //
