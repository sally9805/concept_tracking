Reagan writes on abortion <P> Among the most fervent of Ronald Reagan 's campaign supporters were far-right special-interest groups , particularly antiabortion activists . Yet the Reagan Administration has worked only halfheartedly in Congress for laws that would permit organized school prayer , stop busing and ban abortion , and none of that social agenda has been passed . Still , the President periodically pays lip service to the right wing 's priority issues . <P> Now he has taken up the pen to reaffirm his commitment to at least one of those issues : in the spring 1983 edition of the Human Life Review , an eight-year-old conservative quarterly , Reagan 's byline appears over a rambling but passionate pro-life article called " Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation . " <P> The ten-page , 3,000-word essay 's most memorable passages , if only for their high-pitched earnestness , graphically express Reagan 's strong views . He attacks Roe vs . Wade , the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down state laws prohibiting abortion . Since then , the President says , " more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by legalized abortions . " Turning almost harrowingly explicit , Reagan writes : " The real question today is not when human life begins , but , What is the value of human life ? The abortionist who reassembles the arms and legs of a tiny baby to make sure all its parts have been torn from its mother 's body can hardly doubt whether it is a human being . " Another passage : " But how many Americans are aware that abortion techniques are allowed today , in all 50 states , that burn the skin of a baby with a salt solution , in an agonizing death that can last for hours ? " <P> If the Reagan article was ghostwritten , no one at the White House is saying so . Two staff members of the Office of Policy Development did the research and first draft . But , the White House says , Reagan reviewed the material and polished it . The nonprofit Human Life Review , which has a circulation of some 10,000 , did not pay the President , nor , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested last summer to presidential aides that Reagan contribute an essay , and the manuscript arrived in the magazine 's New York office only five weeks ago . <P> An essay by a recent sitting President is rare , but has precedent . Gerald R. Ford , among others , in 1976 explained " What America Means to Me " over two pages in the Reader 's Digest . Richard Nixon wrote an 800-word piece for FORTUNE in 1970 on the natural environment , and then , having warmed up , turned out in 1972 the unquestioned record setter for a White House incumbent , a detailed analysis for U.S. News &; World Report of U.S. foreign policy that ran a long 10,000 words .
