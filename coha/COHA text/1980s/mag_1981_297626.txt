Despite sordid charges , a basketball-fix trial stirs little interest <P> In federal court in Brooklyn , a tall , sad young man from Boston College has been on trial more than a month , accused of shaving points in six B.C. basketball games during the 1978-79 season . Perhaps he will learn the jury 's verdict this week . His name is Rick Kuhn , and except for the eyes , he seems younger than 26 . He sits at the defense table alone , but in the company of four other defendants , men with even older eyes and Damon Runyon-sounding names , including convicted extortionist Jimmy ( " the Gent " ) Burke . The testimony has been a seamy accounting of gamblers , kids , bribes and beating Harvard by " less than twelve . " <P> Strangely , this is the first time a college player has ever actually stood trial on the charge of point shaving . Before , there were guilty pleas . But neither the press nor the public has appeared too interested in the trial . Except in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One wonders . The matter may be a simple one of honor forfeited at a young age , but it may also tell of the innocence of an age lost altogether . <P> Around college basketball , " scandal " is a word from 1951 or 1961 , outdated now . Sportswriter Arthur Daley , writing of the ' 51 fix charges involving 33 players at seven schools , observed : " All scandals are ugly , and this is a particularly vicious one because it touches the presumably untouched . " Can there be any such presumption in ' 81 ? <P> Now the scandal may be that followers of college sports are incapable of being scandalized . The well-known climate of corruption , exploitation and hypocrisy is also well-documented , if only in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 's own rap sheets , so hard to keep up with these days . What was it again that was going on at the University of New Mexico ? The University of Miami ? The University of Colorado ? Oregon State ? Arizona State ? Oklahoma State ? All of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Because of the nature of the game , basketball probably leads all sports in recruiting excesses . One great player can be enough for a championship . The usual rationale for rule bending- " everyone does it " - never was expressed so emphatically or officially as in a district court in New Mexico last July . When former University of New Mexico Coach Norm Ellenberger was convicted of defrauding the state and making false public vouchers ( in order to use the money as a back-pocket fund for recruits ) , Judge Phillip Baiamonte pronounced sentence by wondering , " How fair is it to incarcerate in prison a coach who was basically doing what almost everybody in this community wanted him to do ? Namely , win basketball games at any cost . . . I 'm being asked to sentence a man because he got caught , not because his conduct was unacceptable . " Ellenberger got off with one year of unsupervised probation . <P> The original function of intercollegiate athletics as an extracurricular activity is a laughable thought today , long lost in the rush for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stakes are certainly high enough to explain the under-the-table handouts to players : the cash , the cars and the altered transcripts of academic grades . And then to this atmosphere of expedience add the element of gambling .
