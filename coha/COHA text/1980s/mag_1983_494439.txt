Priestley has written a creditable , if impersonal , biography , and the best lengthy treatment yet of Mingus 's music . Mingus was a difficult man and is a challenging subject . He was the Ezra Pound of the jazz world , silent and dignified at the end , a voluble organizer earlier , and imposing and creative throughout . He ca n't be categorized . He was one of the great improvisers , and a virtuoso on the bass ? which he sometimes abandoned in favor of the piano . Yet he wanted to be known as a composer . He was a bebopper who loved Ellington , a composer who applied techniques developed in his " cool " pieces of the early 1950s to some of the hottest performances of the end of the decade . He wrote stinging satiric numbers like " Fables of Faubus " and a series of portraits of the beautiful women in his life ; these latter pieces are usually in the key of D flat , as Priestley points out . Many of his works have unusual structures ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but the best of them seem passionately inevitable . On a commission from Brandeis University , Mingus wrote " Revelations Part One , " which opens with a sombre section played by classical musicians and later moves into jazz improvisation . Still , in his most productive period , Mingus liked to teach his musicians by ear . The problem , as he saw it , was that a jazz musician introduces : his own individual expression rather than what the composer intended . . . ( Now I " write " compositions ? but only on mental score paper ? then I lay out the composition part by part to the musicians . i play them the " framework " on piano so that they are all familiar with my interpretation and feeling and with the scale and chord progressions to be used .

For instance , they are given different rows of notes to use against each chord but they choose their own notes and play them in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to keep my own compositional flavor in the pieces and yet allow the musicians more individual freedom . Mingus wanted his musicians to be free and yet to sound like Mingus . Although this method produced performances that showed surprising integrity of style , many of his distinguished sidemen quit out of exhaustion , or because of the difficulty of the music . " He was totally tyrannical , " said John Handy . Trombonist Jimmy Knepper , who produced his most important work with Mingus , spoke of the bassist as a fate that he would like to avoid : " 1 want to play standards . " Mingus introduced pedal points into jazz as well as " extended forms , " long periods of improvisation over a couple of chords , and he wrote difficult polyrhythms , accelerandos , and crescendoes into compositions of shifting moods and rhythms . Mingus discovered jazz as a child , when he heard " East St. Louis Toodleoo " on the radio . Later he said that his crucial influences were Ellington and the classics , to which the music of Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands of Lionel Hampton , Louis Armstrong , and Duke Ellington , as well as with Charlie Parker . Armstrong fired him when he told the trumpeter that he would accept no racial insults on a southern tour ; so did Ellington when , as a result of an argument with Juan Tizol , Mingus chased the trombonist across the stage with an axe . Mingus was a difficult and mercurial man , anxious to remain himself . For a long time he resisted the influence of Charlie Parker while developing a comparable virtuosity on his own instrument . He was an astonishing bassist , with a flawless , expansive technique in any range of the bass , a huge moody tone , and unparalleled rhythmic drive . He directed his bands from his bass , priding himself on being able to conduct conversations in music . ( One of these , with Eric Dolphy , can be found on " What Love . " ) Priestley tells of a doctor who tested this ability by having Mingus say , on his bass , " I think Charles Mingus is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mingus sent other messages too . He would shout in exuberance , or when he was n't getting what he wanted from his band , and he would exhort , threaten , or even fire his musicians on stage , all in the interests of the most intense performance . Priestley tells how Mingus rehearsed a large group for an important performance at the Monterey Jazz Festival ? he lectured them . To learn the music , they finally had to have rehearsals without him . In interviews given seven years apart , two Mingus sidemen , George Adams and Bobby Jones , independently compared playing with Mingus to being let out on a string : they found they could go as far as possible within Mingus 's framework , providing they recognized who was holding the string . A composition , Mingus told his drummer Dannie Richmond , must have a center . OK , if you had a dot in the middle of your hand and you were going in a circle , it would have to expand and go round and round , and get larger and larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop , and then this same circle would have to come back around , around , around to the little dot in the middle of your hand . Mingus said comparable things about the beat in black music , mentioning in his autobiography the prolonged slap of the clapping in a black church , so different from what he would expect from a white congregation . And he invented a name , " rotary perception , " for the faculty that allowed that loose beat to work in jazz : Swing proceeds in one direction only ? but this rotary movement is , of course , circular . Previously jazz has been held back by people who think that everything must be played in the " heard " or obvious pulse . . . . With Rotary Perception you may imagine a circle around the beat .. . The notes can fall at any point within the circle so that the original feeling for the beat is not disturbed . If anyone in the group loses confidence , one of the quartet can hit the beat again . Things came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of re-cordings , first for his own company , Debut , and then for Atlantic , Bethle-hem , and Impulse , in which the fervor of the playing matched the intelligence of his compositions . He experimented . A version of Gershwin 's " A Foggy Day " begins with honks and other sound effects reminiscent of " An Amer-ican in Paris . " He indulged himself on " The Clown , " which is performed behind an im-provised narration by Jean Shepherd about a pathetic , self-destructive , but in-creasingly popular clown . And in pieces like " Haitian Fight Song " he introduced fury into jazz that had nev-er been there before . In 1963 he recorded a coher-ent , album-length work , The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady . Priestley calls this album " not only the most monumental of Mingus 's works but the one which most nearly combines his various compositional approaches in a convincing whole . " Priestley is most helpful when talking about works such as Black Saint , or when identifying the recurrence of favorite Mingus phrases , chord progressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frequently cannibalized his own works . The bridge on the early piece " Eulogy for Rudy Williams , " for example , appears in various forms throughout his career . ) Black Saint , as Priestley notes , was heavily edited and overdubbed by Mingus . Mingus created new material by repeating previously recorded figures and dubbing solos over the repeats . He created a series of climaxes by putting different takes of the same section back to back . Black Saint , Priestley concludes , " marks the first occasion in any field where the combination of overdubbing with creative editing actually determined the nature of the product , " and , in an appendix , he gives us a table that allows the reader to follow these manipulations . Friestley has conscientiously assembled much of the published materials ? interviews , profiles , and statements by Mingus ? related to his subject . Still , there are gaps . Priestley talked to two of Mingus 's wives , but , it seems , to none of his children . He has read interviews and talked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have had equally interesting things to say . And too often he substitutes speculation for argument . Mingus himself remains mysterious . In his very fictionalized autobiography , Beneath the Underdog , a surprisingly buoyant book considering its self-pitying title , Mingus explains his own theory about himself : In other words , I am three . One man stands forever in the middle , unconcerned , unmoved , watching , waiting to be allowed to express what he sees to the other two . The second man is like a frightened animal that attacks for fear of being attacked . Then there 's an over-loving gentle person who lets people into the uttermost sacred temple of his being and he 'll take insults and be trusting and sign contracts without reading them and get talked down to working cheap or for nothing , and when he realizes what 's been done to him he feels like killing and destroying everything around him , including himself , for being so stupid .                   @ @
