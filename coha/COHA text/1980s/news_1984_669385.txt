' ' No , but it ' s making them more difficult , ' ' says Jeffrey Kenner of Carl Marks &; Co. of New York. // He concedes that adverse publicity has made the public question the concept of the leveraged buyout , or LBO . Indeed , Securities and Exchange Commissioner John Shad has recently decried ' ' the leveraging of America . ' ' And the increasing numbers of participants in the LBO marketplace have driven prices up . Companies are being bought for higher multiples of earnings than was the case just a few years ago. // But Mr. Kenner and others in the industry insist that the concept is ' ' sound , as long as the financing meets the needs of the company . ' ' Moreover , people in the industry insist that LBOs are helping to ' ' rekindle the entrepreneurial spirit of America. ' ' // An LBO is a way for a company , or a part of a company , to change hands by allowing buyers to obtain financing collateralized against the company ' s assets. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with a small down payment and the rest of the purchase price is obtained from a bank in the form of a mortgage loan , paid off over time out of the purchaser ' s regular salary . If the purchaser gets in trouble and can ' t pay off the loan , the bank gets the house. // A typical LBO situation might be , let ' s say , the Widgets Division of XYZ Conglomerated International Inc . Once a principal business line of XYZ , the Widgets Division has faded from glory as the parent company has pursued new activities in high-technology and service businesses . Nowadays Widgets doesn ' t even appear in the company ' s annual report until about Page 47. // But the Widgets management knows the widget market will remain strong for years to come . The people running the division believe implicitly in its product and have some ideas on how to make it better. // So a deal is put together : Managers put in some money , plus equity participation from an LBO company like Carl Marks , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top layer of financing - loans at a very attractive ( for the banks ) interest rate. // Once out from under XYZ ' s corporate thumb , the newly established Widgets Corporation blossoms ; sales rise . The bank gets paid off out of operating income , and the loan officer heaves a sigh of relief when it becomes clear the bank won ' t get stuck having to repossess a lot of widgetmaking equipment. // This is how it goes in theory , at least . In practice , though , ' ' There is no longer that kind of basis for financing , in a lot of the cases we see , ' ' says Patricia Riley Merrick , senior vice-president with Charterhouse Group International Inc. in New York . Nowadays it ' s not just assets , but earnings , that get looked at hard , she adds. // Many observers in the financial world express concern , too , that heavily leveraged businesses could be heading for trouble in the next cyclical downturn , just like a homeowner who gets laid off in a recession and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrick maintains that leveraged buyouts can work even during recession : It ' s all a question of the basic soundness of the companies being taken private . ' ' If it ' s a good company , it will be able to grow , reinvest , and still cover debt service . These are business judgments , and not just financial ones . In the 11 years we ' ve been doing this , we ' ve bought 23 companies , and they ' ve been through periods of 21 or 22 percent interest , and they ' ve all survived. ' ' // She adds , ' ' A highly cyclical business is not the best candidate for a leveraged buyout - unless it ' s really growing . If it ' s really growing on a secular level , there will still be earnings to cover the debt. ' ' // Charterhouse has seen companies taken private ' ' doing far better than they were under the aegis of a large corporation . ' ' A Wall Street source echoes , ' ' It ' s amazing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - when they go from being hired hands to owners of the company. ' ' // ' ' You don ' t want to be doing deals at the top of the cycle , ' ' says Michael R. Dabney , vice-president and general manager of the commercial financial services department of General Electric Credit Corporation , a major source of funding for LBOs . The best time to buy out a division or a company , he says , is at the bottom of the cycle . But as with a stock , he concedes , it is not easy to know whether a rebound will occur or whether it is down to stay. // Mr. Kenner of Carl Marks advises against capital-intensive businesses as candidates for LBOs . ' ' If you have to invest $40 or $50 million to modernize equipment and that sort of thing , it ' s not a good time to do a buyout . The time to buy it is after all that. ' ' // Mr. Dabney adds , ' ' With higher prices and less coverage ( of debt ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who spend a lot of time researching the earnings of companies ( being considered for LBOs ) - not just the amount , but the quality - how sensitive they are to the market. ' ' // Mr. Kenner says the problems with buyouts come when a company decides to put itself - or parts of itself - on the auction block , inviting a variety of competing buyout companies to make bids . ' ' It ' s hard to give ' due diligence ' in a case like that . ' ' The best situation is ' ' if we identify an opportunity ; if it ' s an idea we create . ' ' Other observers concur that bidding wars do no one any good. // One criticism of LBOs is that once taken private , they ' ' flip ' ' - are sold again . The advantages of management ownership are negated , and huge profits are realized - from selling a business , rather than running a business . The case everyone talks about is former Treasury Secretary William Simon ' s recent 200-for-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dabney says , ' ' The possibilities for ( flipping ) are really very slim. ' ' // ' ' It ' s not a common phenomenon , ' ' says John Murphy , partner at Adler &; Shaykin in New York , ' ' although it ' s inevitable that institutional investors will be made liquid at some point. ' ' // Mr. Kenner advises against taking a heavily leveraged firm public . ' ' When a firm is leveraged , it ' s good to be private. ' ' // Those financing LBOs insist that for all the publicity , most LBO activity is with smaller companies , those with annual sales of $25 million to $75 million . And of course , some LBOs are buyouts by public companies , and there are private companies bought out by other private companies. // Just how risky are LBOs , especially for banks ? One Wall Streeter says , ' We ' re taught to say everything is risky . But by definition here , we ' re talking about established , mature businesses , not raw start-ups . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
