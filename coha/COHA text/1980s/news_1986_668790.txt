Communist rebels suspended peace talks with the Philippine government and several thousand demonstrators marched to the gates of the country ' s main military camp Friday in twin protests against the slaying of a leftist leader . A crowd of 3 , 000 to 5 , 000 mostly young people gathered outside Camp Aguinaldo carrying red banners and shouting slogans demanding the resignation of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile . The scene , though on a far smaller scale , was strangely reminiscent of nine months ago , when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the same gates to support Enrile in the early stages of what proved to be a successful military uprising against President Ferdinand Marcos . This time , though , the crowds were there to blame Enrile and his military supporters for the murder Wednesday night of Rolando Olalia , a labor leader who was president of Partido ng Bayan ( People ' s Party ) , the largest leftist political party in the country . Olalia ' s body , mangled with multiple stab and bullet wounds , was found Thursday beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidnaped the night before , and there was widespread speculation that the military was responsible . Just two days before he disappeared , Olalia had thrown his support behind the troubled government of President Corazon Aquino in a nervous standoff against the military . There were rumors the military was planning a coup , and Olalia had publicly declared he would call a nationwide strike if the military made a move . " There is no question in my mind that the military did this killing , " said Firmo Tripon , who had organized what leftist leaders called a " march of indignation " to the gates of Camp Aguinaldo . " My primary suspect has to be Enrile himself . " Enrile has denied any involvement in Olalia ' s killing , and the army chief of staff , Gen. Fidel Ramos , has ordered the military " to lend all assistance " to the investigation . The government offered a $10 , 000 reward for information about the killing . Olalia ' s death and the tension it created led Israeli President Chaim Herzog to cancel a planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , but a statement from the Israeli Embassy said Herzog decided to cancel " in view of the recent political developments and particularly because of the very recent events . " Communist rebels also called off a crucial meeting with government negotiators , who said they hoped to put the finishing touches on a proposed cease-fire agreement Friday . Agriculture Minister Ramon Mitra , a member of the government negotiating team , said his rebel counterparts sent a letter notifying him they would not attend the much-awaited meeting because of Olalia ' s killing . Mitra said rebel negotiators feared for their lives and pointed to what they considered " a pattern " of events aimed at derailing the peace talks . They noted that once before , when they were close to agreement , a top communist leader , Rodolfo Salas , was arrested by the military . " They ' re beginning to wonder if they ' ve done the wrong thing by coming out into the open to negotiate , " a Western diplomat said . " Can you blame them ? " Mitra said the rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he expressed confidence the peace process could continue . Aquino discussed Olalia ' s killing with her Cabinet Friday morning and later visited the chapel at the University of the Philippines , where the labor leader ' s body was taken . Aquino , who was cheered by 1 , 500 students , spent 45 minutes in the chapel and told Olalia ' s widow she would " do everything to seek justice . " Aquino appealed to Filipinos to " maintain sobriety , " recalling that after her husband , former Sen. Benigno Aquino , was assassinated in 1983 , she rejected a march on the presidential palace . Crispin Beltran , spokesman for the 650 , 000-member militant trade union May 1 Movement , which Olalia also headed , said plans were being discussed for a general strike but that no date was set .
