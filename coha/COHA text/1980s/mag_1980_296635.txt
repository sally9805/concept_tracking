Three years ago , Associate Editor Gerald Clarke attended a sneak movie preview in San Francisco with hundreds of screaming children , a few science-fiction buffs and the creator of the film in question , George Lucas . Clarke emerged from the theater to urge that TIME 'S editors schedule a major story about " a movie you have to love . " Clarke 's article appeared soon after , previewing a film that was to receive a tidal wave of national attention : Star Wars , the fun-and-fantasy space opera that became the most financially successful motion picture ever made . <P> Movie sequels never seem to measure up either to the original or to the memories of our enjoyment . The Empire Strikes Back , the second " chapter " in Lucas ' saga , was awaited with trepidation . Again Clarke sneaked an early look-and once more came away eager to write a major story . Says Clarke : " This is no ordinary sequel . Lucas and his company have used their Star Wars profits to make a film far more sophisticated in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , and he seems to have taken up where Disney left off . There are disappointments in The Empire , but it retains that special sense that fairy tales have-a moral dimension that touches us much more deeply than one-dimensional action adventures can . " <P> The film brought Los Angeles Correspondent James Willwerth , who interviewed Lucas and many of the film 's principals for the story , back to memories of his childhood . " It is a fairy tale disguised as science fiction , " he says . Willwerth confesses that he is not a science-fiction fan , but says , " I enjoyed the film thoroughly because it reminded me of my own childhood fantasies . During three days of talks , Lucas told me that what he wanted to do in the Star Wars series was to create a ' classic children 's tale , ' so the assignment suited me fine : I still like Peter Pan and Snow White . My older brother read L. Frank Baum 's Oz stories to me when I was little , and I intend to read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Willwerth 's favorite moment came in Modesto , Calif. , during a talk with Lucas and his parents , whose conservative views the film maker does not share . The couple avoided current events , describing instead how their son is the pride of his home town . Reports Willwerth : " Then George Senior 's face clouded up and he exclaimed : ' What if Jane Fonda had been our daughter ? ' "
