" In New York , " grumbled a California editor last year , " they are convinced that nothing can happen except in the area of Manhattan bounded by the lounge of the Algonquin and the dining room of the Four Seasons . " Then came Evan Connell 's Son of the Morning Star , a brilliant account of General George Custer and the Battle of Little Bighorn . It climbed the best-seller list and remained there for six months . Not for the first time , the industry was forced to admit that some of the nation 's better publishing houses are located a world away from New York . <P> The most distinguished is North Point Press , whose volumes are models of polish and elegance : many of its paperbacks have dust jackets . The house was founded seven years ago by Real Estate Millionaire William Turnbull , 59 , and Bookstore Owner and former Salesman Jack Shoemaker , 39 . Turnbull , whose bulk and authority give him the aura of an editorial-cartoon plutocrat , chose the name because " if you know which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The firm moved into a converted church and rectory in Berkeley in January 1980 . The quarters were chosen , says the founder , " because we knew we would have to pray a lot . " <P> For more than four years North Point survived on little more than faith . Its catalog offered some 30 titles a year by such respected but noncommercial authors as Essayist Guy Davenport , Poet Donald Hall and Novelist Gilbert Sorrentino . The company debt increased to $500,000 . Still , the house made a virtue of its liability . For one thing , it never insisted on exclusivity . M.F.K. Fisher , the cooking authority and memoirist , was able to publish her new works with Knopf as long as North Point controlled the reprint rights . That way , Turnbull decided , Fisher had " both a husband and a lover . " Writers and agents were assured that " our small size permits very personal attention . We take our authors ' calls collect . An ear is always there to listen . " <P> One of the talkers was Evan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 1959 ) and Mr. Bridge ( Knopf ; 1969 ) , had been published by Manhattan-based companies . He found North Point Press " invariably courteous , " and when they offered him attractive royalties and a substantial advance , he signed on . Every aspect of production was negotiated , a sharp variance from the dictatorial New York style . " Evan did n't want photographs in the book , " Turnbull remembers . " We felt they might make it more salable to history buffs . Evan won . " But the author conceded another point : he provided a detailed index . <P> North Point 's original projection of first-year sales was 15,000 . There are now more than 150,000 hard-cover copies in print . " It was a pleasure to be wrong , " Turnbull admits . " The world now knows that we have maturity and competence . " Adds Shoemaker : " Up till now we had yet to prove that we could sustain an effort and back up a best seller . Son of the Morning Star has shown that with a staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow through with a first-rate promotional effort . "
