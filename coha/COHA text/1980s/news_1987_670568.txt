The group , movement , cult , salon - its form eludes precise definition - forgathered well before World War I in the London borough for which it was named . And as much for its personalities as its output , it endured for three decades - more , really , considering that its effect on the style of England ' s haute bohemia lingered on after World War II . In a biography of Vanessa Bell who , with her sister , Virginia Woolf , was the circle ' s center , Frances Spalding says that the term Bloomsbury eventually came to mean " a certain manner , faintly upper class , decidedly intellectual , often witty , slightly eccentric . " To bring the point home , the writer quotes Osbert Sitwell observing that the collective outlook involved enormous tolerance for the untoward or eccentric and " amused wonder " at the ( usually lower class ) commonplace . Thus , the proper response to , say , a man meeting his wife at a railway station after a long absence would be : " How simply too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ' s essential to lead with the jaw when getting off such comments. // Where books about Bloomsbury are concerned , the emphasis has so far been on its literary reputations , particularly Virginia Woolf ' s . Now , revisionist attention is focusing on its painters : Bell ; Duncan Grant , her live-in lover and the father of her daughter , Angelica ; Roger Fry , another lover , and Dora Carrington , the would-be lover of Lytton Strachey who , in turn , was the lover of Grant , his cousin , and - but enough . The art ' s the thing and it ' s having its moment at the Katonah Gallery in Katonah , N.Y. // The exhibition numbers 22 works , most of them paintings and all of them drawn from the Reader ' s Digest Collection by Dr. Susan B. Casteras , who is curator of paintings at the Yale Center for British Art . Since " Bloomsbury Artists at Charleston , " as it is called , comes with a slide display , a film and other attractions ( of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another traveling show projected by Dr. Casteras . This will survey Bell ' s art and , if all goes according to plan , will appear in New York City. // Those hoping to reach an objective conclusion about the " Bloomsberries ' " paintings are in for a rough time - not because of the presentation , which is excellent , but because there is so much mystique to clear away . That , and the vintage of the pictures : the majority were done between the early 1930 ' s and the late 1950 ' s when , it seems , the artists were past their prime . An exception is the undated flower piece by Roger Fry , a lovely little item that looks as if it was painted around 1910 , the year the artist-connoisseur confronted England with " new " French art in the form of his show titled " Manet and Post-Impressionism. " // Even when Fry regresses to Impressionism , as in his Sussex landscape of 1933 , he proves himself the most accomplished of the group . The short-lived Dora Carrington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circa 1925 . This is a remarkably mature work for a painter in her early 30 ' s , especially since she seems to have devoted so much of her time to philandering , despite her marriage to one man , Roger Partridge , and her all-consuming passion for another , Strachey . But then , most of the Bloomsberries led extremely busy emotional lives. // Bell and Grant often worked together , and in their designs for , respectively , a Shell Oil poster and a carpet , it shows . They are horizontal abstractions - oils on paper done during the 1930 ' s - that incorporate floral motifs painted in quiet , close-valued colors . Grant ' s is the more complex of the two , but both reflect the influence of Matisse , which the artists sustained earlier during the heady days of the Omega Workshop . This was the William Morris-like operation founded by Fry that flourished from 1912 to 1920 and attracted several English modernists interested in applying their art to functional objects. // But except for the un-English vividness of their colors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrian . Grant ' s 1937 study of lilac and flame-colored tulips , combined with a yellow book titled " Opel , " is his best effort , the objects being as broadly painted as the Matisse-like figure in the canvas behind them . Otherwise , he favors broken color with emphasis on browns and alizarin crimson - hues that creep through the canvases , making them look overheated. // Bell ' s paint is more fluid , and while she is not the florid painter that her contemporary Matthew Smith is , her bravura attack sometimes brings him to mind . Hobbling this , however , is a kind of four-beats-to-a-bar approach to composition , and , in some of her flower paintings , banal taste in accessories - for example , the table lamp in " Tulips in a Vase , " circa 1937. // The aforementioned slide show , compiled and narrated by Rosalie Dolmatch , includes reproductions of earlier works by the artists . Since the one of Grant ' s 1933 still life in front of French windows - a work that is in the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dependable guides . Nevertheless , those of Bell ' s pictures suggest that she was at her most adventurous before 1916 , when she and her husband , the critic Clive Bell , settled at Charleston , in Sussex . The " good talk " and bohemian goings-on continued unabated in this beautiful 17th-century house , and so did the painting . A separate display of photographs indicates that the artists covered practically every inch of the walls and furniture with lively decorations . At the easel , however , they succumbed to inertia. // Country life can be an occupational disease for English artists and evidently Bell and Grant were not immune . Incidentally , it ' s worth remarking that even as they labored at their Post-Impressionism in Sussex , there existed 3 , 000 miles farther away from the headquarters of modernism innovators such as Stuart Davis , Georgia O ' Keeffe and Marsden Hartley. // A gallery devoted to the educational aspects of art , the Katonah has outdone itself here by clarifying the difference between art and culture and at the same time demonstrating how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason enough to catch the exhibition before it closes , but there are also the alluring " extras , " such as Quentin Bell ' s interview of Grant , filmed in 1969 at Charleston when the painter was 86 years old . Most important of all , though , is the symposium that is scheduled for Oct. 10 at the Reader ' s Digest headquarters in Chappaqua and that requires advance booking and $70 to attend . Nigel Nicolson , the son of Harold Nicolson and Victoria Sackville-West , and Deborah Gage , the founder and trustee of the Charleston Trust , are but two of the distinguished speakers . For information , the number is ( 914 ) 232-9555 . ( Through Oct. 25 at the Katonah Gallery , 28 Bedford Road , in Katonah , N.Y. ) //
