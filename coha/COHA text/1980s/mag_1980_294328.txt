The party 's mayors have delivered a lot less than they promised <P> In the piazza in front of Naples ' city hall , a group of leftists waved banners and chanted angry slogans , demanding that the mayor take action to give them jobs . " Enough of promises ! " they cried . " Give us work ! " Inside his office , in a palace that dates back to the last of Naples ' Bourbon rulers , Mayor Maurizio Valenzi , 70 , was trying to explain his city 's problems over the din of the protesters . Valenzi is anything but a Bourbon ; he is , in fact , a Communist , one of a score of Communist mayors elected to office in major Italian cities in the party 's wave of election victories in 1975 and 1976 . Like most of the others , he is decidedly frustrated , because as a group Italy 's Communist mayors have been no more successful at solving urban problems than their centrist or right-wing predecessors . <P> The mayors came to power with lavish promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host of other blights that bedevil Italian urban centers . A model government in Bologna , successfully run by Communists since 1945 , had inspired millions of voters to believe that the Communists were brilliant city managers . Riding the wave of that single reputation , the party hoped to produce showpiece regimes that would help catapult the Communists to national power by the sheer force of local example . <P> In practice , however , the newer mayors have proved largely helpless in dealing with the country 's deep-rooted economic and social ills , which have only worsened since the Communist Party won 34.1% of the national vote in 1976 . Italians who had hoped for instant results , in fact , have been quick to register their disappointment at the polls : earlier this year the party suffered a wrenching loss of four percentage points in the Chamber of Deputies . <P> Expectations were obviously too high , as Valenzi 's Naples shows only too well . Despite the mayor 's efforts to build employment , Naples still has the highest proportion of jobless in Italy , 84,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men seek jobs , employers farm out work to be done illegally in household sweatshops , where women and children toil for minuscule wages without benefit of social security , labor laws or other protection . <P> TIME Rome Bureau Chief Wilton Wynn reports that the housing shortage in this city of 1.2 million is so bad ( an average 2.8 persons to a room , four to a room in the worst slums ) that one newly married couple was forced to live separately , the bride with her parents , the groom with his . The couple found privacy for lovemaking only in their tiny Fiat , parked on a dark street . But even so triumphant a Fiat accompli was rudely interrupted last month by bandits who held up the pair while they were enjoying their cramped privacy .
