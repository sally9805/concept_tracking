The change of tone , which was apparent in several articles over the last few weeks , was particularly evident in a long new appraisal of American foreign policy circulated Saturday night by the New China News Agency as part of its year-end roundup of international problems. // " The United States and the Soviet Union belong to the same category , " said the commentary , which was attributed to the New China News Agency ' s Washington correspondent , Peng Di. // " In the eyes of the other countries , " the commentary said , " they are the superpowers : and each is the other ' s number one adversary . They alone can pose a formidable threat to each other and imperil each other ' s strategic interests and security. " // Such a portrayal was familiar under the late Mao Zedong . But with the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Peking and the development of commercial ties , the leadership of Deng Xiaoping muted the references to the United States as a superpower and focused its charge of hegemonism on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some Peking-based Western and third world diplomats who noticed the revival of the previous ideological formula have suggested at least two reasons for it. // The first is that China , having emerged from the isolation of the Maoist years , is trying to enhance its image as a champion of the developing world. // This has been shown in China ' s participation at the so-called north-south economic dialogue in Mexico in October and , more recently , in its successful efforts at the United Nations to block the re-election of Kurt Waldheim in favor of a secretary general from the third world. // The second reason is that Mr. Deng ' s regime is clearly unhappy with the Reagan Administration ' s tentative plans to sell new jet fighters to the Nationalist Government on Taiwan and may be distancing itself in anticipation of possible domestic criticism . Peking has contended that Washington , when it normalized relations , acknowledged that Taiwan was a part of China and represented an internal problem to be resolved by the Chinese themselves. // " We have put our message through to American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a senior Chinese diplomat said during a recent conversation . If the Reagan Administration went ahead and sold the planes to Taiwan , he said , " It doesn ' t leave us much room to maneuver . We won ' t have much choice except to retaliate strongly . " <> <> Nature of Response Unclear // The Chinese Government has avoided spelling out what steps it would take . The expectation in Peking diplomatic quarters is that Mr. Deng would have to downgrade relations to some extent to placate hardliners in the Government and party who would question the advantage of his accommodation with Washington. // Another well-placed Chinese official confirmed that the revival of references to the United States as a superpower constituted a warning of Peking ' s annoyance over the Taiwan arms issue. // During visits to Nigeria and Ghana this autumn , the Chinese Foreign Minister , Huang Hua , referred to the United States and Soviet Union as the two superpowers , though some Western diplomats here saw this as currying favor with the nonaligned African countries. // But this month , when Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in a similar manner , accusing it of promoting instability in Northeast Asia . Mr. Zhao reiterated his country ' s support of Pyongyang ' s demand that United States troops withdraw from South Korea , drawing an implicit parallel between alleged American interference in the Korean peninsula and its aid to the Nationalist Government in Taiwan. // The latest commentary by the New China News Agency developed Peking ' s current image of " Moscow on the offensive and Washington endeavoring to stave it off . " Mr. Peng said that a flaccid United States had awakened to " the grim reality that its weight might fail to match its ambitions and desire . " <> <> Third World Called Crucial // The commentary said that the most crucial aspect of American foreign policy involved the third world , particularly the Middle East and South Asia , which were the targets of Soviet expansionism. // " The question remains whether the United States has the resolve to make bolder adjustments of its policy toward the third world , " the commentary said. // It complained that Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals " and instead shored up its " old friends , so long as they are pro-American and anti-Communist. " // The New China News Agency said the United States was not reluctant " to interfere in the affairs of others countries , even at the expense of its own long-term strategic interest . Its approach to China ' s Taiwan is a case in point. " // China has periodically accused the United States of giving the Soviet Union an advantage in the Middle East by blindly supporting Israel . The latest analysis of the Reagan Administration ' s foreign policy also questioned its concern over Nicaragua and El Salvador. // " It is one thing to counter Soviet and Cuban expansionism , " the New China News Agency said . " It is another to oppose the people of those countries rising in revolution. " // " The United States Government has proclaimed opposition to hegemonism of any country as its basic policy , " the analysis said . " Well , it is much easier to oppose the hegemonism of others than to oppose one ' s own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States foreign policy. " //
