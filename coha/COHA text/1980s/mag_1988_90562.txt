Why did n't I tackle him ? // Six years later and 3,000 miles away , the question still haunts me . So sometimes , on brisk Saturday mornings in the fall , I head for New York City 's Central Park with my saxophone to reenact that tragic day when I , along with the rest of the Stanford Band ( actually , the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band ) , changed the fortunes of the Cardinal football team . I play a few of my favorite tunes as I watch pickup football games on the park 's Great Lawn . And invariably , when one team kicks off to the other , I feel an urge to run onto the field . I turn toward the ballcarrier , and duck my head to make the tackle . But I never go through with it . I 'm just not the type to interfere . // The situation was pretty much the same six years ago , on Nov. 20 , 1982 , at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley , Calif . In the closing seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But with four seconds remaining in the game , the University of California ran a five-lateral kickoff return past me and through the Stanford Band , which was on the field , in what has been known ever since simply as The Play . Brushing by future engineers and physicists before leveling a trombone player in the end zone , the last Cal ballcarrier scored the winning touchdown and marched into football history . // I know , because I was in the band . And to this day , I honestly believe that last play was my fault . I feel responsible for having led the Stanford Band onto the field before the game was over , a move that caused Stanford 's painful loss of the Big Game  --  the all-important season finale . // It turns out that other band members blame themselves , too . In fact , we 'll never know for sure who led the band onto the field . On the videotape of the game , you can catch a glimpse of me carrying a tenor saxophone and sporting a tall , cone-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was known in the band as " Kohnhead , " after the old Saturday Night Live routine . ) But the camera focused on the ball , not the band , during those last few moments , so nobody knows for sure who was at the front of the pack . // This is the way I remember it : I was waiting just outside the Stanford end zone in my official band uniform  --  red jacket , black pants , white sneakers and , as prescribed in our handbook , " the ugliest tie you can find . " We also wore white hard hats that day to protect us from the frozen oranges hurled by Cal fans . // The Cardinal , led by senior quarterback John Elway , had just taken a 20-19 lead after a long drive capped by a dramatic field goal , and with only four seconds left , the ensuing kick-off would end the game . Anxious to lead the charge from the end zone , I pushed my way to the front of the band . I slung my sax under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the hard hat from falling off my cone . Going into a slight crouch , I dug the toes of my white hightops into the artificial turf and peered over my sunglasses to watch for my cue to march onto the field . // With a roar from the stands , Stanford kicked off to Cal . The Bears then started to bring the ball up the field toward us . The Stanford players moved in to make the final tackle , as the fans behind us bellowed out the countdown . " Four , three , two , one ! " I was off , screaming at the top of my lungs while sprinting onto the field : " Wedidit ! Wedidit ! We ... Damn it . " // I was somewhere near the Cardinal 40-yard line when , about 20 yards away , a Cal player erupted from what had appeared to be the game-ending tackle . He had the ball ! I broke out in a sweat as I realized what a fool I had been . The play was n't over . // My mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I run ? What had triggered me ? Had I actually heard the final whistle ? I had played football in high school , and I knew that a game was n't necessarily over when the clock expired  --  you had to wait for the final tackle . Here I was , caught on the field in front of 76,000 howling fans , not to mention all those TV viewers . // At that moment , it dawned on me that I had n't yet actually interfered with the play . There was time to escape , a chance that my errant jaunt might go unnoticed . But when I turned to retreat , I was nearly trampled by a rampaging mass of redcoats . The band ! Had they come to lynch me for disgracing the mighty Stanford name ? No , they stormed right past me . They , too , had come to celebrate . // I dodged the onslaught of my fellow madcap musicians , some of whom turned and joined me as I scampered back toward the end zone . My panic started to subside as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanford head coach Paul Wiggin. // Coach Wiggin was surely going to come after me for leading the band onto the field . I pictured him in hot pursuit of my highly conspicuous headpiece . I had to shed my identity . First I pulled the cone off my head and drop-kicked it among the bug-eyed band members who now pressed close around me . Then I looked around desperately and saw  --  yes !  --  my roommate , Jake Jeakle . I grabbed the trumpet from beneath Jake 's arm , and thrust my saxophone toward him , demanding a trade . Jake was confused , but seemed to sympathize . He cowered next to me , but I quickly moved away , leaving him to fend for himself . // Meanwhile , all eyes were directed at the game 's officials , who huddled near midfield . I was sure they were deciding my fate . As the crowd waited restlessly for the decree , I prayed the officials would just decide to take the play over . I could n't understand why they were making such a fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touchdown had been scored  --  oblivious even to the fact that trombonist Gary Tyrrell had been clobbered by ballcarrier Kevin Moen in the end zone . ( It was n't until later that evening , when I saw the replay , that I realized Moen had run past several band members  --  within tackling distance  --  down the Stanford sideline. ) // Finally , the officials emerged from their meeting with a ruling . Touchdown ! " Touchdown ? " I said to myself . Were they punishing the band ? Because I had n't seen Moen make it to the end zone , I wondered if they had awarded Cal a touchdown because of the possibility the Bears might have scored if the band had n't interfered . I thought the decision was preposterous , but I was in no position to complain  --  I had caused this mess . I was devastated . // A boom from the cannon atop the hill overlooking Memorial Stadium announced the Cal victory and ignited a roar from the home crowd , which spilled onto the field . We stood in shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game 's trophy ( the head of an axe mounted on a plaque ) , removed the chains that had attached them to the trophy , and relinquished the Axe to a Cal committee . Cal 25 , Stanford 20 . ( Stanford , by the way , has never accepted that score , and continues to change it on the trophy to " 20-19 " whenever it takes home the Axe after the Big Game . Cal , of course , changes it back when it gets the Axe. ) // Our drum major blew his whistle , suddenly bringing the band back to reality . We despondently began playing Hail , Stanford , Hail , making a lame attempt to absolve ourselves of any wrongdoing . Stanford fans stood dumbfounded . I kept looking over my shoulder , expecting to find a fuming Wiggin rushing toward me . My glances were met instead by Cal fans who applauded and mouthed thank you 's to the Stanford band members in the stadium din . // The ovation continued as our bus slowly rolled out of Berkeley . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chance for a winning season ( we would have had a 6-5 record ) , but it also ruined Stanford 's shot at a postseason appearance at the 1982 Hall of Fame Bowl in Birmingham . // I was doomed . We were on our way back to Palo Alto , where I was sure I would be collected by the authorities . Coach Wiggin would probably spit on me as they loaded me into the paddy wagon . The conehead , which had been my key to acceptance in the band , had now been my downfall . // But back at Stanford it became apparent that , although the band would bear the brunt of the guilt for the calamity , many other factors surfaced to relieve us of the ultimate blame . A penalty flag had been thrown during the play , but it was against Stanford so the penalty was declined . Stanford 's coaches contended that Cal did n't have the required number of players on the front line for the last play ( it did n't , but the officials did n't see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play dead when the third ballcarrier 's knee touched the ground ; and that one of the five laterals had actually been a forward pass . More important to me personally was the revelation that many players from both benches , including some of the Stanford players who now accused the band of causing the loss , had also gone onto the field prematurely , thinking that the game was over . // Not only was the band eventually exonerated by most people , but The Play also turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to us . It brought exposure , publicity , fame and talk-show appearances to the bandsmen , especially to our famous , or infamous , tackled trombone player , Tyrrell . On network TV he received an apology from none other than Kevin Moen , as well as $500 from the show . // " Why did n't you tackle him ? " band members were often asked . " Well , he was huge , for one thing , " I heard one bandsman mumble . Six years later I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we had actually tackled Moen . There were 200 of us . We could have taken him .
