txt Against that kind of overplay , Aguirre took only two shots in the second half , tipping in one basket . But he made four of his five assists in the second half . And his teammates , adjusting to Aguirre 's play , picked up the slack . TERRY CUMMINGS , the game 's leading lebounder with 11 , scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half and made seven of nine shots . " Mark adjusted , " Meyer said . " By overplaying Mark . Creighton left our inside game open . Terry got the ball . Our inside game became awesome . " Bradshaw also benefitted from the overplay on Aguirre , making six of his eight points ' in the second half . " It 's wonderful to have a point guard like Clyde , " Meyer said . " Ten assists in the first half and 14 for the game . It 's great to have a point guard'so unselfish he does n't care if he gets a point as long as we win . " Bradshaw picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half , but Meyer never considered benching him . " Clyde 's too smart , " Meyer said . " And we went into a zone . We knew then , if Creighton tried to shoot over our zone , we 'd get the ball and run with it . " THE IDEA of role  --  playhtg crystalized in recent days , Meyer said , because the Demons have been thinking of the NCAA tournament . And Meyer discussed the tournament during Sunday 's practice . " I told them they 'd have to improve at certain things ? like rebounding ? f()* the tournament , " Meyer said . " And because the boys played their roles better tonight , we rebounded better ( a 46-35 De Paul edge ) . " Dillard said he was one of several players who asked for a private conference with his coach to discuss the upcoming tournament . " We felt we were the best team last year , but we lost , " said the junior guard . " And we feel we 're the best team this year . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our biggest enemy is ourselves . " I told Coach I wanted to find my role , " Dillard said . " I said I felt I was trying to do too much . " 50 , NOW THE ROLES are defined . Dillard will Play tough defense and pick apart zones sagging on Aguirre . Cummings will hit the boards and take passes against defenses overly conscious of Aguirre . The same applies for Teddy Grubbs or Bernard Randolph . And Bradshaw , orchestrating the whole production , will fire assists to Aguirre if he 's being defended " honestly " or fake to Aguirre and throw it to others when Mark is two-timed . If that sounds like Aguirre dictates the Demons ' options , listen to Dillard talk about the man who plays either " no role " or " all the roles " ? depending how you look at it . " I really feel , " Dillard said , " that if Mark wanted to get 100 rebounds , he 'd get ' em . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
