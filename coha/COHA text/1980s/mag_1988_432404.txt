 | Dr. Thomas E. Starzl , like all the pioneers of organ transplantation , had to learn to live with failure . When he performed the world 's first liver transplant 25 years ago , the patient , a threeyear-old boy , died on the operating table . The next four patients did n't live long enough to get out of the hospital . But more determined than discouraged , Starzl and his colleagues went back to their lab at the University of Colorado medical school . They devised techniques to reduce the heavy bleeding during surgery , and they worked on better ways to prevent the recipient 's immune system from rejecting the organ ? an ever-present risk . When Starzl and his team returned to the OR in the late ' 60s , their patients started surviving to go home . Now , thanks to further refinements , about two thirds of all liver-transplant patients are living more than a year . " We 've gone from the unattainable to the routine , " says Starzl , who is now at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from just 26 in 1981 . The number of heart transplants rose from 62 to about 1,500 over the same six-year period . And the number of kidney transplants soared from about 4,900 to nearly 9,000 . Success rates have increased just as dramatically . Today 80 percent of transplanted hearts are still beating after a year , compared with 66 percent a decade ago . The success rate for kidneys is 91 to 96 percent , about the same as it is for corneas , cornpared with 62 to 65 percent in 1979 . But the triumphs of the transplant surgeons have created yet another tragic problem : a severe shortage of donor organs . " As the results get better , more people go on the waiting lists and there 's a wider disparity between supply and need , " says Dr. Keith Reemtsma of New York 's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center . The American Council on Transplantation estimates that on any given day 15,000 Americans are waiting for organs-13,000 for kidneys , 500 for livers , 900 for hearts , 200 for combined hearts and lungs and 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs ; each year about 25,000 healthy people die unexpectedly in this country , usually in accidents . The problem is that fewer than 20 percent become donors . This trend persists despite laws designed to encourage organ recycling . Under the federal Uniform Anatomical Gift Act , a person can authorize the use of his organs after death by signing a statement . In about 43 states , permission can be checked off on driver 's licenses . The University of Texas Transplant Services Center , in Dallas , passes out small metal " keys to immortality , " which identify any carrier as a " tissue/organ donor " and provide the center 's phone number . Legally , the next of kin can veto these posthumous gifts , but surveys indicate that 70 to 80 percent of the public would not interfere with a family member 's decision . The bigger roadblock , according to some experts , is that physicians do n't ask for donations , either because they @#  | fear offending grieving survivors or because they still regard some transplant procedures as experimental . Under another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff are required to ask family members about an organ donation whenever such a donation is medically feasible . Forty-three states and the District of Columbia have their own " required request " statutes as well . But it is n't yet clear what impact the laws have had . When there are n't enough organs to go around , distributing the available ones becomes a sticky and morally charged issue ? a matter of deciding who will live and who will die . Once donors and potential recipients have been matched for body size and blood type , the sickest patients customarily go to the top of the local waiting list . If a recipient ca n't be found for an organ in one locality , it goes to the sickest suitable patient on a national list kept by the United Network for Organ Sharing . Urgency seems an obvious standard , but some experts question whether it is really fair , since the desperately ill tend to have the least chance of surviving . Beyond the seriousness of the patient 's condition , doctors base their choice on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , how long it will take to obtain an organ and whether the transplant team can gear up in time . But time is always of the essence : kidneys remain viable for up to 48 hours , but hearts can be kept for only three to five and livers for only 10 . ' Wallet biopsy ' : There are other , more subjective considerations as well . Some patients are denied organs because of their age ? until recently , most centers would n't permit a heart transplant on anyone over 55 ? or because they are not U.S. residents . According to University of Minnesota medical ethicist Arthur Caplan , some hospitals show bias against homosexuals and the handicapped . " There 's a very quiet , unexamined system of triage , " Caplan says . Hospitals also weigh financial considerations . Although the organ itself is free , the bill for surgery and hospitalization is astronomical . The cost of a heart transplant runs from $80,000 to $140,000 , a kidney $30,000 to $40,000 and a liver $180,000 to $460,000 . Kidney transplants are covered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other procedures are n't . Some insurance companies still regard liver grafts as experimental and wo n't pay for them , and five states will not cover any transplants under the Medicaid program for the poor . So the first procedure many transplant centers per- form on a potential recipient is known sardonically as the " wallet biopsy . " If the patient ca n't come up with a down payment ? which may be as high as $100,000 ? he does n't get a transplant . Transplant researchers hope to ease these ethical and financial burdens by developing better medical techniques . At the 12th International Congress of the Transplantation Society , held in Sydney , Australia , last month , researchers voiced renewed interest in xenografts , transplants of organs from other species . " I believe the long-term solution is the use of nonhuman organs , " says Columbia-Presbyterian 's Reemtsma , who , in fact , performed two chimp-to-human kidney transplants in the 1960s . But xenografts magnify the problem of rejection . All humans carry antibodies that react against tissues from other primate species ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a muchpublicized 1984 operation ) . Because of the power of animal-rights sentiment , some researchers doubt that xenografts will ever be an acceptable answer . An even more esoteric possibility would be the use of cells , rather than whole organs , for transplants . As a substitute for transplanting the whole pancreas , for example , researchers are testing implants of the organ 's insulin-producing " islet " cells to treat diabetics . Drs . David Scharp and Paul Lacy of Washington University School of Medicine , in St. Louis , placed homogenized pancreatic tissue containing islet cells in the spleens of six diabetics ; in three of them the cells produced insulin for up to two months . Now Lacy and Scharp are testing a preparation that contains a much purer extract of islet cells . The increasingly sophisticated techniques of molecular biology and genetic engineering offer even more revolutionary possibilities . Neuroscientists Don Gash and John Sladek Jr . of the University of Rochester Medical School , for example , have treated cells from a cancer called neuroblastoma with drugs that turned them into what look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish . Gash and Sladek foresee the day when cells of many organs ? brain , liver , blood , skin and pancreas ? will be grown in " immortal " tissue cultures to provide an endless supply for transplants . Honing skills : While exploring these farout possibilities , surgeons must fine-tune their present techniques . They need to improve their skills at transplanting lungs and intestines ? still an experimental procedure because the organs are difficult to reattach ? and they are working doggedly to develop better anti-rejection drugs . Treatments like cyclosporine and OKT3 have helped reduce the risk of rejection , but these drugs attack all the T-lymphocyte blood cells that support the immune system , not just those that strike the new organ . By taking the drugs continually , transplant recipients face the constant threat of infection . Right now , researchers are experimenting with genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies that attack only those cells that cause rejection . At Massachusetts General Hospital , surgeons give experimental animals monoclonals at the time of transplant and find that they survive for up to two years without conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these tools were dreamed of by Starzl and the other transplant pioneers 25 years ago . But in due course they may enable surgeons to fulfill one of the boldest goals in the history of medicine ? truly interchangeable parts of the body . Says Starzl : " We 're at the start of a new cycle . " NEWSWEEK : SEPTEMBER 12 , 1988 63
