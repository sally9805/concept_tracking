One of them accused Mr. Shultz of " standing facts on their heads " and compared his statements to those of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy . The other charged the Administration with " red-baiting " on Nicaragua. // The exchange began when Mr. Shultz repeated the Administration ' s contention that Nicaragua and Cuba were involved in international drug trafficking . That led to charges that the Administration was deliberately distorting facts in its effort to win support for its anti-Sandinista policy. // The Secretary of State , angered by the charges made during a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on international operations , said at one point he would not answer any more questions from Representative Ted Weiss , Democrat of New York , until Mr. Weiss apologized to him for the McCarthy comparison. // Mr. Weiss , who represents the 17th district on the West Side of Manhattan , denied he had meant a personal comparision , but later said he apologized " in advance " if the record showed he had done so . <> <> Secretary Accused of ' Nerve ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shultz of having " a lot of nerve to come before this committee and criticize members of this committee for being demagogic. " // " There has been a lot of red-baiting going on in the Administration , " he said , " and I think it began in the White House and I hope it ends fairly soon. " // Mr. Shultz shot back , " I thought I was here at the invitation of the committee , but if you care to withdraw the invitation , I ' ve got a lot of other things to do. " // " Well , you ' re the Secretary of State and there ' s nothing we can do about it , " Mr. Kostmayer replied , as other members of the committee sought to restore calm . Eventually , the hearing proceeded with its stated task of considering the Administration ' s $2. 8 billion State Department budget request. // The outbursts and shows of temper today dramatized the heightened emotions here over Nicaragua and the question of aid to the rebels . The Administration , led by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the issue directly with Congress on gaining approval of $14 million in covert aid for the rebels that was authorized last year but which requires a new vote in both houses. // The Democratic-led majority in the House is generally viewed as opposed to continuing the aid and , as the debate has evolved , the polemics on both sides seem to be rising. // Not only is Mr. Shultz under attack from those opposed to aiding the rebels , but he has also , today and on Tuesday , had to deal with conservatives in Congress who feel that the attention given to Nicaragua should be matched by outrage against Moscow for its military actions in Afghanistan. // On Tuesday , for instance , when he was appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Mr. Shultz engaged in a heated exchange with Senator Gordon J. Humphrey , Republican of New Hampshire , who wanted " linkage " between continuing the arms control talks with the Soviet Union and an end to Soviet activity in Afghanistan . Mr. Shultz at one point snapped , " Come off it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua , who invited members of Congress to visit his country ' s military bases . Larry Speakes , the spokesman , said the Administration wanted genuine action , not just " propaganda . " <> <> ' A Show-and-Tell Offensive ' // " In our view , " Mr. Speakes said , " an appropriate peace offer would be that which would meet our concerns with actions rather than a show-and-tell propaganda offensive. " // In another development , Langhorne A. Motley , Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs , complained vigorously that a senior Nicaraguan official visiting Washington this week has lobbied Congress and granted interviews with journalists but has failed to make use of normal diplomatic channels. // Referring to Victor Hugo Tinoco , Nicaragua ' s Deputy Foreign Minister , Mr. Motley said : " He has yet to make his first call to the State Department . " He added , " They don ' t want to talk to us " even while professing their willingness to do so. " // Mr. Motley told a White House briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undeservedly favorable light. // The dispute with Mr. Shultz arose when the Secretary was asked by Representative Benjamin A. Gilman , Republican of New York , some questions about the State Department ' s efforts at blocking drug trafficking. // Mr. Shultz , in the course of his answer , commented , " I might say that Nicaragua and Cuba are directly involved " in the drug trade " as a way of generating funds . " He said there was " an interplay of narcotics trafficking and terrorism. " // This led Mr. Weiss to say , " Nothing more clearly illustrates the approach the Administration takes than the response you just gave to Mr. Gilman regarding the narcotics problem when you gratuitously drew in by the heel Cuba and Nicaragua to a situation where you know that whatever role they are playing - and I am not ready to defend their role - is minuscule compared to the role that has been played in narcotics importation to the United States from countries which are the allies of the United States. " // " It reminds me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 when Joe McCarthy decided to attack a young , recent law graduate as one way of getting back at the Army and then attorney Welch said ' At long last , Mr. McCarthy , have you no decency ? ' " // " It seems to me that the Administration policy toward Nicaragua has been an exercise in twisting facts , in distorting facts , in misstating facts , " Mr. Weiss declared. // In 1954 , during the televised hearings before a Senate committee meeting to hear charges and countercharges between Mr. McCarthy and the Department of the Army , Mr. McCarthy at one point said the Army ' s counsel , Joseph Welch , had in his law firm Fred Fisher , who he said had been a member of an organization that was " the legal arm of the Communist Party. " // Mr. Welch acknowledged that Mr. Fisher had told him that he had been a member of the Lawyers Guild while in law school and for a few months afterward but was now a Young Republican. // After Mr. McCarthy continued to attack Mr. Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lad further , Senator . You have done enough . Have you no sense of decency , sir , at long last ? Have you left no sense of decency ? " <> <> Shultz Responds Angrily // Replying to Mr. Weiss , Mr. Shultz declared , " It is the ultimate perversion to say that an attack on the tactics and strategy of Nicaragua is comparable to the tactics of Senator Joe McCarthy. " // " And when you compare me with Senator Joe McCarthy , I resent it very deeply , " he continued . " And I have no further comment to make. " // When Mr. Weiss asked another question , Mr. Shultz replied , " I won ' t comment to a Congressman on his questions until he apologizes to me for comparing me to Senator Joe McCarthy. " // Mr. Weiss initially said that he was not making a comparison but rather that Mr. Shultz ' s statement " reminded me of the Army-McCarthy hearings. " // Later in the hearings , Mr. Weiss said he would apologize in advance if a reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he had been compared to Mr. McCarthy. // Mr. Shultz said " Thank you " and proceeded to answer further questions. // //
