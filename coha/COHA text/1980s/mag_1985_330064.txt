RV <P> Nice young men from good families , Chris Boyce and Daulton Lee had known each other since their days as altar boys in a decorous Los Angeles suburb . At 21 , Chris , an expert falconer , got a job at TRW , the aerospace and electronics behemoth . Within a few months , after a cursory security check and at a weekly salary of $140 , he was helping monitor some of the CIA 's most embarrassing top secrets , including dirty tricks directed against Australia 's Labor government . By this time Daulton was an important man in his own right , in his own eyes : he had established a lucrative trade in cocaine and heroin , living high on the profits and slick-talking his way past a judicial system as indulgent as his parents . Soon , the renegade idealist and the venture capitalist joined forces to foul up the system by selling U.S. spy satellite codes to Soviet emissaries , in Mexico City . What delicious revenge on America 's bland malevolence and institutional incompetence ! What an entrepreneurial scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boyce and Lee , who were arrested and convicted in 1977 , inspired a bestselling book by Robert Lindsey and now John Schlesinger 's movie version . In An Englishman Abroad , the 1983 BBC-TV film he directed from Alan Bennett 's script , Schlesinger painted a wry , rueful portrait of the British spy  --  Guy Burgess , retired to Moscow  --  as a displaced person , isolated from his best friends and instincts . Chris Boyce ( Timothy Hutton ) feels isolated too , trapped in America ; but here Schlesinger dares not flirt with political or visual subtlety . Everyone is an oaf but our lad . Mom ( Joyce Van Patten ) is dithery , and Dad ( Pat Hingle ) scares the falcon , and Chris ' girlfriend ( Lori Singer ) is one big vacant California erogenous zone . His treason is pinned on mid-America , not so much for the evil of its ways as for the banality of its style . Affluence is flatulence ; good intentions are to laugh at ; filial piety is worth nothing but betrayal . <P> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it loathes before it can soar or score . The Soviet embassy in Mexico City is alive with swarthy-suave , worldly-wise apparatchiks ( led by David Suchet ) , alternately amused and baffled by the bravado of Daulton ( Sean Penn ) , a kid who has always had his way and can not be intimidated by any old nuclear power . " O.K. , " he barks when they cross him , " from now on I do my business with the Chinese ! " Sporting a cad 's mustache and Walter Denton 's whiny voice , Penn is a funny , harrowing wonder of energy . No other young actor so cunningly combines the mannerist danger of the Brando-De Niro school with the articulate assurance of a stand-up comic . Hutton is just as fine in a role that demands  --  and gets  --  caged heat , the taste of a soul gone sour , sanctity imploding into rage . He and Penn are the only compelling reasons to see a film that is oddly engrossing in spite of itself . <P> In 1980 Chris Boyce escaped from Lompoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank robber and fisherman , for 19 months before his capture . To many of those he met then , he is still a friend , and maybe a hero . That story could make for a sequel  --  The Falcon Strikes Back , perhaps ?  --  superior to the original movie . The early careers of Chris and Daulton prove that truth is stranger , and more thrilling , than docu-drama.
