Whenever solar energy is discussed , references are made to thermal mass , or heat storage , and its importance to a sun-heated building . By storing the excess heat that pours into a house on a cold but sunny day , thermal mass enables the home to remain relatively warm long after the sun goes down . Excess heat given off by a wood- or coal-burning stove can also be stored in this manner for later release when the stove goes out. // What is thermal mass ? Anything that stores heat . That baked potato , for instance , stored heat and , come lunchtime , was part of a hearty meal . But earlier , its stored heat helped warm grandpa ' s hands as he trudged to school. // When you lift the frying pan or pot from the stove , it doesn ' t go cold the moment it is taken from the heat source . That ' s because both the pot and the food it contains have enough thermal mass to store heat . Indeed , it is a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know a hot meal . Conversely , a meal can quickly go cool if placed on a cold plate , because the thermal mass of the plate draws the heat from the food. // A most common application of the principles of thermal mass a generation ago ( and slowly regaining popularity in this new era of lower nighttime temperatures ) involved the hot-water bottle . The bottle ( at first a glass bottle with a screw-in stopper , but later of rubber ) was filled with hot water from the kettle and taken to bed at night . Water stores a lot of heat for its volume , so the hot-water bottle stayed warm for hours. // Heated bricks or heated soapstone were frequently used in the same way. // The adobe ovens of the American Southwest work so effectively because of their thermal mass . An intense fire is burned in the oven for a short while , during which the heat from the flames is soaked up by the surrounding wall of thick adobe clay . When the fire is out , the ashes are raked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored heat radiates back to bake the bread or whatever. // Today , stove manufacturers sometimes increase the thermal mass in their products by lining them with firebricks . Soapstone stoves , because of the heat-storing material from which they are made , continue to radiate warmth long after the fire goes out . Austrian tile stoves likewise hold heat well. // So much for what thermal mass is . Why is it so important to a solar-heated or stove-heated home ? Quite simply , it moderates the extremes of temperature that would otherwise occur within the home . It keeps it from overheating when the sun shines and from getting cold the moment it doesn ' t. // A friend of mine , now an acknowledged expert in the solar field but still a neophyte when he built his first home , loaded the house with large , south-facing windows but didn ' t compensate with additional thermal mass . The results were predictable . Even when the temperature was 10 degrees F. , the home would quickly approach saunalike temperatures indoors if it remained closed up on a sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be opened , and all the heat that would have been so valuable at night had to be spilled outdoors. // The effectiveness of thermal mass was recently brought strongly home to me . Identical wood stoves heat the living room of my Massachusetts home and the central room of the cottage I am building in Maine . Because of the liberal use of mortar in its construction , the cottage has considerably more thermal mass than the all-wood Massachusetts house. // In Massachusetts , the stove will quickly back us up against the walls if we don ' t damp it down once the fire is going well . In contrast , the same type and size of stove never overheats the cottage , because the masonry work soaks up the heat the way a sponge draws up water. // True enough , the cottage may take somewhat longer to warm up when we first arrive . But thereafter , it is by far the more comfortable place to be . Long after the stove has burned itself out at night , the temperature remains comfortable . In theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hot summer days. // A rule of thumb suggests the exposed area of thermal mass should be three times the area of the south-facing glass. // Including adequate amounts of thermal mass is a relatively simple matter in a new house , but can heat-storing materials be added to the existing home ? Obviously , there are ways that this can be done , but all involve care in seeing that the materials involved do not add more weight to a floor than the existing joists can support. // An acquaintance of mine is adding afieldstone facing to part of his living-room wall to get needed thermal mass into his otherwise all-wood home . Before doing this , however , he plans to build a wall of concrete blocks from the ground to the floor so that there will be no sagging of the floor and consequent cracking of the fieldstone facing . Bricks can be used in a similar fashion. // Water can be turned into useful thermal mass by storing it in containers ( anything from glass or plastic jars to steel drums or commerially made fiber-glass tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . While thermal mass will absorb heat from the surrounding air , it absorbs vastly greater quantities if it is bathed in sunlight or is directly in the path of heat radiating from a stove. // Before adding themal mass to your home , it would be well to know how well the various materials hold heat. // One cubic foot of concrete and stone will store 22. 46 BTUs ( a measurement of heat ) for every 1 degree F. that its temperature is raised . Brick is marginally better at 24. 6 BTUs , and water almost three times as effective at 62. 40 BTUs per degree . Vastly more effective - but also vastly more expensive - are phase-change salts now being marketed . A cubic foot of the salts will store 134. 76 BTUs for every degree F. increase in temperature. // By contrast , a cubic foot of air requires a mere 0. 018 BTUs to warm up one degree . This means that a relatively small amount of thermal mass can warm up a large volume of air. // //     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
