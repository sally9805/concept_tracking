LECTURES ON DON QUIXOTE by Vladimir Nabokov ; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 219 pages ; $17.95 <P> Master of nuance , connoisseur of transparent things , Vladimir Nabokov disliked the blunt instruments of art . " I remember with delight , " he liked to say , " tearing apart Don Quixote , a cruel and crude old book , before six hundred students . . . " Yet he lectured on the book at Harvard , partly because it was required reading but also because it struck some chord in the speaker . The lectures , reconstructed by Editor Fredson Bowers , disclose reasons for that resonance . <P> As Nabokov acknowledges , Don Quixote the novel may be flawed , but Don Quixote the man is permanent . The bony knight and his fat squire , Sancho Panza , are the most recognizable duo in all of fiction . The lecturer traces their " long shadow " through the works of such disparate men as Dickens , Flaubert and Tolstoy . Had he ventured only a little further , he might have found quixotic elements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nabokov . <P> But influence does not guarantee indulgence . As the great Russian scrutinizes the great Spaniard , revisionism becomes the order of the day . Sancho 's celebrated proverbs are in fact " not very mirth provoking . . . The corniest modern gag is funnier . " Don Quixote 's attempts to act like an old cavalier show " a rather limited schoolboyish imagination in the way of pranks . " As for the author , " Cervantes. . . seems to have had alternate phases of lucidity . . . and sloppy vagueness , much as his hero was mad in patches . " Don and squire wander and blunder through Spain , tilting at customs and rituals , obscure priests and famous windmills . En route , they are beaten and humiliated in " a veritable encyclopedia of cruelty . " Even the animals suffer so greatly , admits Cervantes , that if a horse " had possessed the power to complain , you may be sure that he would have been an equal for Sancho and his master . " <P> Indignity by indignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the work . Even his slips are calculated : " Platitudes ( sorry , latitudes ) . " There are no side trips for biography . Of the author 's " maimed hand you will learn not from me , " says Nabokov , turning back to the " irresponsible , infantile , barbed and barbarous world of the book . "
