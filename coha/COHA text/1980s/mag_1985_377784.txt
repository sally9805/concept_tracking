Shortly after noon on Saturday , July 20 , President Ronald Reagan walked out of Bethesda Naval Hospital and into a changed world . With a golden career and a life of good health behind him , the 74-year-old President now faced the full impact of his mortality and a future marked by constant vigilance against the recurrence of his cancer . For the first time in its history , the U.S. faced the prospect of a sitting President who , no matter how dramatic his recovery , would be followed by the shadow of a major disease for the rest of his presidency . If the President 's personal prognosis seemed promising , the outlook for his presidency was somewhat more difficult to predict . <P> Reagan walked a bit gingerly but waved a blue Navy cap jauntily as he said goodbye to the hospital doctors and nurses . Looking surprisingly fit and fully at ease in blue slacks and an open-necked shirt , the President boarded a Marine helicopter with Nancy for the 15-minute flight to the White House lawn , where some 2,000 well-wishers awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band serenaded the smiling couple as hundreds of gaily colored balloons were released . Reagan 's high spirits were also reflected in his Saturday radio broadcast , taped at the hospital , in which he joked , " I do n't have as much stomach " any more for the failure of Congress to slash federal spending . More personally , he urged those unsure of their health to see a physician and " tell them Dr. Reagan sent you . " <P> Still , even in a nation long buoyed by the President 's cheery optimism , his ailment could infect the almost magical aura from which he has drawn his political power . It could perhaps shift at least a portion of national stewardship to others less serenely self-assured . Reagan has always been more guiding spirit than hands-on manager , but now even the vigor of his vision will be examined more critically , unjustifiably perhaps , but inevitably . <P> He had seemed almost untouchable , able to slough off political barbs and even an assassin 's bullet . His luck had grown so legendary that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the polyp in his bowel would be found benign . But last week Dr. Steven Rosenberg , the chief of surgery at the National Institute of Cancer , reminded the nation in a single chilling sentence that Ronald Reagan is a vulnerable human after all . " The President , " stated the doctor , " has cancer . " <P> Surgery to slice out two feet of his colon had apparently removed the malignancy from Reagan 's bowel , and Dr. Rosenberg quickly explained that the President had a better-than-50% chance to live out his normal life . But the medical experts could not rule out the possibility that cancerous cells had escaped into the bloodstream and , like a microscopic time bomb , seeded themselves in another organ . If cancer should recur , the President could face a long and debilitating course of therapy that would make the heavy burden of the presidency more onerous . <P> The disquieting bulletin from Bethesda comes at a time when Reagan 's most prized initiatives  --  tax reform , arms control , deficit reduction  --  are drifting if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it may not do much to soften skeptical congressional leaders , much less Soviet negotiators .
