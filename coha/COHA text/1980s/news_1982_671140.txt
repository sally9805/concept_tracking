The financier , David Graiver , who disappeared in a plane crash in Mexico after the collapse of a bank that he was involved with in New York , and other members of his family were vilified here for years. // They were accused of financing the leftist guerrillas known as the Montoneros , who terrorized the country in the mid-1970 ' s . The campaign against them took on anti-Jewish overtones. // Jacobo Timerman , the exiled newspaper publisher , was arrested and tortured five years ago partly for his involvement with Mr. Graiver , who backed Mr. Timerman ' s paper. // But last month , an Argentine judge ruled that five of the jailed Graiver relatives and employees were innocent and had been wrongfully imprisoned for five years . The five were Mr. Graiver ' s parents , Juan and Eva Graiver , his sister-in-law , Lydia Brodsky de Graiver , and two employees , Lydia Gesualdi and Sylvia Fanjul . <> <> Growing Independence of Courts // In a decision that reflected the growing independence of Argentine courts after six years of military rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives - Mr. Graiver ' s wife , Lydia , and brother , Isidoro - but he overturned their convictions by a military court . He ordered them freed until a retrial by a civilian court. // The army balked for five days last month before finally freeing the seven , saying respect for the judiciary was part of its promised move back to democracy. // The court ruling and interviews since then with more than a dozen lawyers , officials and sources close to the family - many of them feeling free to talk for the first time in years - raises doubts about the guilt of Mr. Graiver and the role of senior military leaders , including two former Presidents , in his case. // " The truth might be political dynamite , if ever it is found out , " said a Western diplomat close to the case . <> <> Graiver Wanted in New York // The affair takes on added intrigue because Mr. Graiver is wanted in New York City in connection with financial manipulations that led to the collapse in 1976 of the American Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth largest bank failure in United States history. // The Argentine military has said that Mr. Graiver had an option to buy the bank , partly with $17 million given him by the Montoneros to invest . The Argentine authorities have said that he bought other banks in Belgium and Switzerland that also collapsed. // Mr. Graiver , a paunchy , goateed man , was an ambitious young financier with wide political connections . In 1970 , at the age of 30 , he served as an Assistant Secretary of Welfare for the military government that was in power at the time . Among his many business associates were generals and politicians of varying political views , among them Alejandro Orfila , now the Secretary General of the Organization of American States , and Jose Gelbard , a former Economy Minister . <> <> Ex-Cabinet Minister Accused // Mr. Gelbard , the first Jew to hold a Cabinet post in Argentina , was later accused of ties to the Montoneros . He fled the country and died in exile in Washington in 1979. // Mr. Timerman , arrested five weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was put under house arrest and exiled two years later. // Mr. Graiver disappeared in August 1976 as his chartered jet crashed into the side of a mountain during its final approach to Acapulco . No identifiable remains were found and the cockpit recorder was not recovered . In New York , District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan still has a fugitive warrant out for Mr. Graiver ' s arrest . Seven months after the Mexican plane crash , the Argentine military arrested the seven Graiver relatives and employees , and accused them of complicity in a plot to help the Montoneros . <> <> Electric Shocks and Beatings // According to sources close to the family , all those arrested were tortured with electric shocks and beatings in their first weeks of captivity . One detained employee died of a heart attack while in police custody. // The Argentine press was full of lurid reports at the time on what were said to be the immoral lives , illegal business practices and Marxist designs of the Graivers. // There was a strong element of anti-Semitism . Some newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graiver family members . Graiver family trees were the grist for magazine articles. // " Everyone wanted to believe there were sinister Jewish bankers behind how the Montoneros got their money , " said James Neilson , editor of the English-language Buenos Aires Herald , a newspaper that did not to jump on the anti-Graiver bandwagon. // Now , the Argentine press has been quiet about the judge ' s ruling on the Graivers . <> <> ' The Blood of Good Argentines ' // But the family ' s captor , retired Brig . Gen. Ramon Camps , reacted . He said the Graivers ' " hands are stained with the blood of good Argentines , " and " the link of Graiver , Timerman and Gelbard with the subversion can not be questioned. " // Family members say they do not know if David Graiver was involved with the Montoneros . But their own story , revealed officially for the first time in the judge ' s ruling and repeated in interviews with family sources , was that people claiming to be Montoneros approached them after Mr. Graiver ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened them with death. // Isidoro Graiver , the brother , says he reported the threats to Lieut . Gen. Roberto Eduardo Viola , who was then the number two man in the army . The family argues that the complaint to General Viola and a letter to the President at the time , Lieut . Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla , were signs of their innocence. // General Viola , who later became President , told the military court that he had met with Isidoro Graiver but did not remember any talk of threats . General Videla said he had never received the letter . <> <> Pawns in a Power Struggle // Western diplomats said the Graivers were , at least in part , pawns in an internal military power struggle . Hard-liners , including General Camps , had hoped to find evidence to discredit moderates such as Generals Videla and Viola . None of Mr. Graiver ' s many gentile business partners were questioned , however. // It is still a mystery just where Mr. Graiver got the money for his overnight international business empire . His father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money came from an " international mafia . " But Stephen B. Shriffrin , a former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney who spent months poring through the Graiver financial records in the United States and Belgium , said in a telephone interview that Mr. Graiver had never had enough money to buy the banks. // Mr. Shriffrin also said that he did not believe that Mr. Graiver had tried to buy the banks with money from the Montoneros . " If he had the money , he wouldn ' t have had to do all the manipulating , " he said. // Some of the questions may be answered in pending suits in the United States , Belgium , Argentina and other countries . The suits involve more than $100 million in assets that have been missing , seized or otherwise contested. //
