China 's model shirtmaker <P> Five years ago , morale was bad and production worse at the tiny Haiyan shirt factory in Zhejiang province , 69 miles from Shanghai . The enterprise was in such dire condition that workers who were ready to retire could not do so because of an empty pension fund . The value of the plant 's assets totaled only $10,000 , and profits rarely topped $2,300 . <P> Today Haiyan is one of China 's fastest-growing garmentmakers , with a labor force of 630 , assets of $817,000 and 1983 profits exceeding $242,000 . The state-owned factory 's success is the result of a new policy by the Chinese government that has given virtually unheard-of powers to managers in consumer-goods industries , including expanded rights to hire and fire , to lay down work rules and to award bonuses for good performance . <P> The Chinese thus hope to develop more badly needed consumer industries by encouraging enterprising managers who know how to use the new freedoms to create profits . The transformation at the Haiyan shirt factory is the work of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The son of a Shanghai tailor , Bu started sewing shirts at the factory in 1956 , and moved up in the ranks by earning a reputation as a hard-driving worker . When industry officials decided in 1979 that the factory needed revitalizing , they tapped Bu for the job . <P> At the time , the plant was like most others in China . Absenteeism , sleeping on the job and a hearty disrespect for managers were only a few of the problems . Bu quickly changed all that . Among other moves , he demanded strict discipline , firing workers who ignored his rules . Angry workers and local party officials opposed the reforms . One fired worker tried to kill Bu with a pair of scissors before being overpowered by employees , and Bu became the target of political attacks . They stopped only after laudatory reports about him appeared in the People 's Daily and on Chinese television . <P> With such struggles behind him , Bu continued to revitalize the company . He has introduced benefits like subsidized housing , and even composed a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have included adding new colors and giving Haiyan shuts their first brand names : Tangren ( Tang Dynasty Man ) , Shuangyan ( Double Swallow ) and Sanmao ( a character in a popular cartoon strip ) . Says Bu : " When I die , I want no wreaths , just the logos of these shirt brands placed on my box of ashes . "
