Marcos makes a concession <P> There was not an empty seat in the room as the five-member commission assigned to investigate the assassination of Opposition Leader Benigno Aquino opened its first meeting in 24 days . The audience was particularly interested because General Prospero Olivas , Commander of the National Police for Metropolitan Manila , would present the military 's official version of the events that led to Aquino 's murder seconds after he stepped off a plane at Manila International Airport on Aug. 21 . Instead , there was yet another surprise in the brief but checkered history of a commission whose credibility has been assailed from the day it was created by President Ferdinand Marcos . <P> Commission Member Felix Antonio announced that Arturo Tolentino , a respected politician who had turned down Marcos ' offer to be chairman of the panel , had persuaded the President to accept several new conditions . In order to give Tolentino " a free hand , " Antonio said , the entire commission would resign . Four days later , Marcos announced that a totally new , and presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members will be appointed by the Marcos-dominated parliament , but three to five others will be chosen on the basis of recommendations from " various sectors of society . " Said Commission Member Filemon Fernandez : " The eyes of the world are watching to see if the Philippine people are capable of selfcriticism , to see whether they have the capability to assert the supremacy of law and bring those responsible to the bar of justice . " <P> Although General Olivas ' testimony was locked into a vault along with the commission 's other documents , it was quickly leaked to the press . He reiterated the government 's claim that Aquino had been killed by a Communist hitman who had somehow managed to penetrate the airport 's tight security . But politicians and diplomats who analyzed the report found glaring contradictions between that claim and the photos and videotape footage of the seconds just before and after the shooting , which have been widely circulated in the Philippines . <P> According to Olivas , the five khaki-uniformed guards who met Aquino aboard China Airlines Flight 811 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the guards , a single fatal bullet entered the nape of his neck and passed in a downward path through his chin . Seconds later , soldiers gunned down Rolando Galman , who , Olivas contended , had " suddenly darted toward Aquino and shot him from behind . " <P> Olivas ' " report " did little to dispel doubts about the official government version . Amadeo Seno , the commission 's deputy counsel , told newsmen last week that he had found a number of contradictions in Olivas ' testimony . Four hours after Aquino was killed , Seno noted , Olivas had described the assassin as being 5 ft. 6 in. tall . But the physician who performed the autopsy later reported that Galman was 5 ft. 9 in. , or in. taller than Aquino . Galman 's height is a crucial clue in determining whether he was tall enough to walk behind Aquino , as the government claims , and fire into his head a bullet that would take a downward path .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
