In the heart of old Damascus sits the filigreed stone tomb of Saladin , the 12th century sultan who ruled an empire stretching from Cairo to Baghdad . Worshipers bound for the gleaming Umayyad mosque pass by without pausing , and children scamper in a nearby courtyard oblivious of his presence . Yet as the premier potentate of the region , the conqueror of Jerusalem and the fearless warrior who helped crush the Crusaders , Saladin united a divided region and set off a burst of pride among his people that glowed for centuries . <P> Though aspirations and methods have been adjusted to the realities of the 1980s , the passion for hegemony lives on in Damascus . Under the shrewd , ruthless , brutally dictatorial guidance of President Hafez Assad , 53 , Syria has been making a bid for the past decade to grasp the torch of Arab unity and emerge as the pre-eminent power in the Middle East .

Finally , by bullying and cajoling its Arab neighbors , Syria is building what it hopes will be a united front to reach its ultimate objective : a comprehensive , made-in-Damascus solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict . <P> In pursuing those goals , Syria is pushing the battle-scarred region perilously close to yet another major war .

Faced with an Israeli-Lebanese accord that provided for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon but failed to take account of Syria , Assad responded by stoutly refusing to pull out his own soldiers and by stirring the embers of hatred among the country 's myriad factions against Israelis and Americans alike . The Reagan Administration , moreover , is convinced that Syria had prior knowledge of , and perhaps even masterminded , the October suicide-bombing of U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut that killed 240 servicemen . For the past two months , Syrian antiaircraft batteries have taken potshots at U.S. reconnaissance planes over Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon ; when the barrage intensified two weeks ago , the U.S. responded with its Sunday-morning reprisal raid . With each passing week , Syria seems to grow bolder in striking out at the U.S. presence in Lebanon .
