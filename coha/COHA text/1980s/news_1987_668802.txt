This story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts . This is part 2 . The Reagan " morning again " spot avoided political argument and went straight for the heart . " There ' s always criticism from people who don ' t understand you can ' t do complicated things in 30 seconds , " says Riney , who professes to have been shocked to learn that there are no legal restraints on political advertising as there are on product advertising . " In 30 seconds all there ' s room for is a snide remark or a slur , " he says . " Advertising is a horrible vehicle for political issues . You are asking too much from it. " ndustry observers point to that ad and other emotional sells for commercial products as examples of a " touchy-feely " trend in advertising that they attribute not to Riney personally but to what has been called " the California revolution . " Michael Koelker , creative director for Foote , Cone &; Belding/ West , San Francisco , which created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between East Coast and West Coast advertising : " ( It ' s ) almost the same as the difference you see in the two cultures . Out here we ' re laid back ; the East Coast is more active , more verbal . Take two pairs of tennis shoes . The West Coast ad agency would go for flash and glitter and emotion , much as Nike does , and they ' d sell like hell . The East Coast agency would do cut-outs of the arch and the suspension system and say , ' We expect incremental increases in sales volume . ' " Yet to Koelker ' s mind , the touchy-feely phenomenon predates the current California-produced ads . Perhaps the earliest and still one of the best of the touchy-feely ads , he thinks , was a spot done by a Midwestern agency for a Kansas City company " maybe 18 or 20 years ago . A girl had had an awful , terrible , miserable day , and it was raining and a car had splashed her . But when she got home , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send the very best . ' " Ron Kaatz , a J. Walter Thompson senior vice president who also teaches advertising at Northwestern ' s Medill School of Journalism , pooh-poohs the criticism directed at Riney and is very positive about the emotions evoked by ads created by Riney and others . " There ' s lots of that sort of advertising being done today , ( ads ) you can respond to and say : ' Yeah , I see that . I can feel it . I understand that . They aren ' t trying to put anything over on me . ' " There are no " Hidden Persuaders " today , he says . In contrast to the blatant sexual overtones of the Jordache and Calvin Klein jeans ads , a Riney ad appeals to the gentler and quieter emotions . If there ' s a trend in Riney ' s work , Kaatz says , " it ' s the flag-waving , getting-on-the-bandwagon , made-in-America thing . I expect to see a lot more of that . " Besides , Kaatz points out , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the best-written ads , " the viewer controls what he wants to see and when he wants to see it , and to compete , you need advertising that entertains and relates . " Riney bristles most over the criticism that his ads are manipulative . " That ' s silly . It ' s like saying profit is dirty . The only people who don ' t seem to understand what advertising is supposed to do seem to be the critics . I ' ve never been in focus groups ( research sessions where people discuss their reactions to products or concepts ) with plumbers when every one of them didn ' t understand precisely what we are trying to do . We ' re advocates . People are paying us to be advocates of one thing ; other people are being paid to advocate the other thing . " Riney says to understand his " It ' s morning in America " ad for Reagan and others like it , you have to think backwards . " I mean visually . You don ' t think of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show something positive about America . What would be good symbols of prosperity , pride ? From there you think about lighting and the time of day . We started with sunrise . If one has to analyze these things , there ' s a freshness about morning . " Part of it may be that Hal Riney just likes mornings . That ' s when he gets to be a creative director again . He says he gets his best writing and thinking done then , when the phones are silent and none of his 140 art directors , creative heads , copywriters , researchers , assistants , secretaries and account executives require his time and attention as chairman and CEO . ( " To err is human , " explains a sign in the staff kitchen above the coffee pot . " To forgive requires Hal . " ) At dawn , three hours after its arrival at the East Coast , Riney is usually already at his ancient Underwood typewriter , pounding out the advertising copy that Madison Avenue can ' t seem to clone fast enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , " says a copywriter who used to work for him . " People want to do Riney-style advertising . " There are reports of four new ad campaigns with serial stories similar to those of Bartles &; Jaymes . Pepsico is said to have plans for a new soft drink called " Jake ' s " supposedly made , you guessed it , by an old , real- people type in a small town . " Did you see what the New York Times said about the new Wells , Rich , Green group ? " asks Riney &; Partners ' president and chief operating officer Jim Travis , beaming . " They ' re going to try to ' sell the sizzle , not the steak . ' " ( Travis recruited Riney for the Reagan-Bush Tuesday Team , then last year gave up his post at the Della Femina , Travisano &; Partners agency to join him . ) The 30- or 60-second spots that Hal Riney has been crafting for nearly 20 years suggest that the man behind the scripts must be a family man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who is constantly sweeping people into his embrace . But is this the sizzle or the steak ? The answer depends on who answers the question . Riney ' s own answer : " I have an odd assortment of children . I have a son by my first marriage , but I didn ' t grow up with him . ( The marriage ) was ending when he came along . Then I married a lady who had three kids , two boys and a girl , since grown . " Son Matthew , 15 , lives with his mother in neighboring Marin County , and Riney stays in touch with his stepchildren . His third wife , Liz Kennedy Riney , 36 , is expecting their child this month . Perhaps suddenly conscious of his paunch and thinning hair , Riney , 54 , says , " I can ' t think why one wouldn ' t want to have a child at an older age , other than you kinda wan na make sure you live long enough to enjoy it . " Baby Riney is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we didn ' t want to know what it was . I like tradition . Isn ' t it awful that those famous phrases we ' ve lived with all our lives  --  ' It ' s a girl ! ' ' It ' s a boy ! '  --  are almost gone ? " Liz Riney on Riney : " He wants to become someone who can really enjoy life , who can take time off , who can be more friendly with friends ; he has visions of being this other kind of person . He idolizes what he didn ' t have . He has a lot of insecurities  --  it ' s growing up on the wrong side of the tracks . " Dick Maugg , his childhood friend who plays Ed Jaymes , nods toward the Bartles &; Jaymes set , a real farmhouse in Napa Valley , and says , " This is where you can see what kind of a person he is . He ' s warm , humorous , ordinary people . He doesn ' t hire movie stars . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a little guy from Longview , Wash. , who ' s worked hard . And , " Maugg adds , shaking his head , " He ' s worked so damn hard . " Hal Patrick Riney was born in 1932 " in the depths of the Depression , I guess they say . I moved around a lot as a little bitty kid . My dad was a sometime writer , sometime cartoonist , sometime salesman , onetime actor . He even ran a newspaper once . " In many ways , Riney has followed in his father ' s footsteps . He boasts he could " still make a living as a cartoonist . " He ' s called his father a Renaissance man , and is said to romanticize even a brief stint in jail that his father did for kiting checks . " I ' m a junior , " he notes proudly , nodding at a picture of his father that hangs above his desk . " We moved to California , and I went to kindergarten in Burbank . At that point my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mom , my sister and me . I thought a great deal of my dad . He was a fine writer . I thought a great deal of him , but I didn ' t know him . I might have seen him 10 times after they were divorced . He died , uh , let ' s see , oh , somewhere around ' 57 . " Riney ' s mother , who now lives in Europe with his sister , was a schoolteacher who spent summers working for the National Park Service . Maugg recalls Riney working as a stockboy at a Safeway food store during high school , and the two of them as Theta Chi fraternity brothers at the University of Washington busing tables at the Gamma Phi Beta sorority house . " In Longview ( then a town of some 20 , 000 ) he was the brightest kid in town , and he was academic , and I wasn ' t . I was always in awe of him . In college he was very serious , hard-working , again much more academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was an artist , a painter , and the little school paper won all sorts of national awards the two years he worked on it. " iney majored in art and minored in journalism and advertising , and graduated to a draft notice and a two-year vacation in Italy as an Army press officer for his Uncle Sam . In 1956 Riney ' s career as an adman started in the mailroom at BBDO agency in San Francisco . " I wanted to be an account man , " he told an Adweek reporter . " I thought these were the guys who were the real ad people . But when I was an account man , I hated it and grabbed a job in the art department . " He has such little use for account executives and others on the administrative side , as opposed to those on the creative end of the business , that of his own account executives he says : " I ' m sure we have a couple left around here . We pay them more to take abuse . " At BBDO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency ' s art director ; in 12 years its vice president-creative director . He began winning some of the industry ' s most prestigious awards . In 1972 he moved to Botsford-Ketchum ( now Ketchum Advertising ) , which in 1976 made the mistake of offering him that New York promotion . He took a few months off to think about the offer and never came back , winding up in Reno ' s bar , where David Ogilvy found him later that year sipping Jim Beam and writing prize-winning ads for Oregon ' s Blitz-Weinhard Brewing . He still escapes to Reno ' s if he has to write and the demands of running an agency interfere with that need , and one of his buddies there is Joe DiMaggio . Riney didn ' t have anything to do with DiMaggio ' s " Mr. Coffee " ads , he hastens to add . " Joe used to talk to me about how he hated the ads  --  not doing them but the advertising people from New York . They were Ogilvy and Mather . ' Tweedle-dee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story is typical understated Riney . A little humor and a little scorn . " He ' s deeply contemptuous of others and he ' s very good at camouflaging his darker side , " says a disillusioned former Riney copywriter . " You are dealing with two people : himself and this persona he ' s created over the years , the wry , twinkly , country fella . At some point the persona sort of replaces the real guy . " Critics say he ' s tyrannical ; Riney says he ' s a perfectionist . Joe Pitka , the Los Angeles director who works on most of Riney ' s TV commercials , has a long list of stories to prove Riney ' s point . " It ' s almost illogical , the lengths he goes to . We built an entire Western street for two seconds of film once because he couldn ' t find anything that looked authentically 1882 Oregon to him . But because he worked so hard , because he went the last step of the final mile , the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years ago . It ' s as if we ' re all miners and he ' s already found one rich vein , but he thinks that if he pushes just a little bit harder , there ' s a mother lode still there . And that ' s what makes ( Riney ads ) magic . " Some staffers have left Riney , claiming he appropriates their ideas . " He skims the cream , then forgets you milked the cow . " Riney says it ' s his job to make sure the client gets the best possible work . There ' s even a rumor in San Francisco that " the idea of two old farmers , one a citrus grower , the other a producer of fine wines , " was bandied about at McCann-Erickson for California Cooler . " I must say his execution of Bartles &; Jaymes is brilliant , " says one man who claims to have been there at the time , " but old folks on porches are his schtick . " ( " Old people are more honest , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Some ex-staffers complain that they ' ve seen Riney be gratuitously cruel , but other staffers , past and present , say that he merely expects as much of them as he does of himself . And if it seems there are more nameless ex-Riney staffers than grains of sand on a beach , and that no one wants to offend him , well , that ' s about right . " Some people quit and go back three or four times , " one ex-staffer says , adding , " Nobody who ' s worked for him doesn ' t have a love-hate relationship with him . " Even Riney claims he has probably influenced or worked with a third of the ad people in the San Francisco Bay area . All his former employees and colleagues seem to want to psychoanalyze this complex man . A former BBDO associate calls him a " classic Jungian archetype , the coyote  --  aggressive , scheming and at the same time godlike . " Another theorizes : " He doesn ' t have a lot of emotional stuff to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions in his advertising . " " If you look beneath the surface ( of the ads ) , there ' s a lot of male-bonding , booze humor , and there ' s an obvious psychological thing about a reunion with the father who ran out on him as a kid . It ' s like ' Reagan thinks , Reagan is . ' " The man is referring to Garry Wills ' new book , " Reagan ' s America : Innocents at Home , " which makes this point . The President speaks of his childhood as " one of those rare Huck Finn-Tom Sawyer idylls , " forgetting the racism , poverty and horror Huck tries to escape , and that his own youth was relatively rootless . Reagan is the best example of an " American instinct to claim a simplicity his circumstances belie , " writes Wills . With Reagan , the perfection of the pretense lies in the fact he does not know he is pretending . He believes ( his ) myths . In a line that could be a description of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everyone ' s home movies of the mind . ' " None of his colleagues  --  nor his wife  --  doubts that the kind of world Riney ' s ads portray is the kind of place Riney would like to believe exists . " I really do think Hal wants to leave the world a little better place than he found it , " a friend said . " He believes the guys in the white hats will win eventually , " says another friend . In real life , Hal Riney is at least as colorful as many celluloid heroes . As often as he can , he escapes to a tiny 50-foot-wide Caribbean island he owns off Honduras . After he and Liz were married in 1982 , he took his bride there for a honeymoon that started with a dawn-to-dusk bone-fishing trip and ended with Riney leading the escape after the Honduran SAHSA Airlines plane they had boarded for the trip back to Tegucigalpa , Honduras , was hijacked by four gun- toting students waving old dynamite that was leaking nitroglycerine and rigged with a clothespin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cola baseball cap with the slogan " Have a Coke and a smile . " The women and children were released , but Riney and the men were held aboard the sweltering plane for three days at the Tegucigalpa airport until the hijackers announced their decision to commit suicide by blowing everyone up . It was near midnight . The hijackers momentarily relaxed their guard . " Hal was standing by an emergency exit , " Liz says . " He asked one of the guys who spoke Spanish what the sign on the door meant . It said , ' Tirez . ' Pull . He did and jumped . " ( That sign is now on Riney ' s office wall . ) Zigzagging " like in the movies " to miss the bullets he expected , Riney ran like crazy the hundred yards to the terminal . When he heard running behind him  --  seven of the other Americans had fled after him  --  he ran straight through a glass door . " He thought they were the hijackers , " Liz says . The escape ended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he awoke later that day from a long-overdue sleep , Riney heard on the radio that fellow-hostage Brian Ross , an NBC News reporter , had led the daring escape . But worse was the caption on the photo the Honduran papers ran of his reunion kiss with his bride . " It said , ' Riney and his daughter , ' " Liz recalls , grinning and grimacing simultaneously . The Rineys have recently moved to a pastel pre-San Francisco earthquake Victorian at the peak of Telegraph Hill . It is so high and so centrally located that Riney can sit on his porch and virtually look into the executive offices atop the landmark Transamerica Pyramid . It ' s also near enough to his office to allow him to walk to work . As an even rarer San Francisco amenity , it has garage space for his Jaguar and Liz ' s four-wheel- drive Scout . Life seems finally to be imitating Riney ' s art ; if there is a bear in their future , and some people think there will be , it ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the subject of bears came up again when Riney addressed the Chicago Advertising Club last November . " There were a couple of guys hiking through the woods , " he intoned in that raspy whiskey voice , a line that some of the creative types in the audience were perhaps already mentally writing into their next script . " They glanced backwards on the trail and saw a bear following them . They picked up the pace a bit . " So did the bear . " When it seemed inevitable the bear would eventually close the gap , one of the hikers stopped , sat down on a stump and pulled out of his backpack a pair of track shoes . " The other hiker looked at him and said , ' You don ' t really think those track shoes are going to help you outrun that bear , do you ? ' " The first hiker , as he tied the laces , said , ' I don ' t have to outrun the bear . I just have to outrun you . ' " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Riney said after all the laughter died . What he didn ' t say seemed obvious . Now he ' s the bear . CAPTION : PHOTO : ( color ) On the cover : Advertising ' s Hal Riney , the man behind those Bartles &; Jaymes commercials .
