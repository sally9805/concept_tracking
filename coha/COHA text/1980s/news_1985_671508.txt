After 10 weeks of inquiry , scores of interviews , thousands of hours of studying financial records by a staff of 14 lawyers and 5 paralegals , Mr. Bell says he is ready to tell the public what he has learned about the illegal activities. // But while Mr. Bell will be handing down what amounts to a verdict , it is his own handling of the investigation and the extent of his findings that will be under scrutiny as well . As the investigator hand-picked by Hutton ' s senior management , Mr. Bell ' s own reputation is at stake , especially if subsequent Congressional inquiries disclose that Hutton top executives masterminded an illegal scheme. // At the least , " He is going to have to blame someone for sloppy or unethical management , or else people are going to think he is a patsy , " said one Wall Street lawyer close to the case . " He knows he is going to be grilled by the Congress and he has enormous concern that he is not tripped up . " <> <> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past have turned out to be neither too soft nor unduly tough , according to some lawyers . " We had these internal investigations during the foreign payments days of the 1970 ' s , " said Theodore A. Levine , an attorney at Wilmer , Cutler &; Pickering in Washington and a former enforcement official at the Securities and Exchange Commission . " And most of the reports I saw were done with integrity . The hard part for Bell , however , will be the judgment calls on what should be done to employees , for example. " // In an interview recently at Hutton ' s corporate headquarters in New York , Mr. Bell seemed confident that he would come out of the investigation with his own reputation intact . " I intend to be fair , " he said . " And I think as long as people see that I am , they won ' t have problems with my conclusions , " said Mr. Bell , who was Attorney General in the Carter Administration. // Moreover , Mr. Bell dismissed the notion that in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his client , if nothing more than to prove he is not guilty of a whitewash . " It ' s not like I was a young lawyer trying to make my mark , " he said . " They hired me because I have a track record - Attorney General , a Federal judge - and I have done five of these internal investigations before. " // He added , however , that he was open to being sued by anyone damaged by his report and that he had not sought indemnity from Hutton. // Mr. Bell said he would explain in his report who was to blame , who should have stopped the activity , which top managers were lax in their duties and what disciplinary action should be taken against any of the people involved , even up to the firm ' s chairman , Robert M. Fomon , if necessary . He said he would also report on how the illegal check overdrafting scheme that used hundreds of millions of dollars of interest-free funds evolved at the brokerage . In essence , he will be passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s executives. // Though most followers of the case doubt that the Bell report will call for drastic changes in top management at Hutton , the reputations and careers of many on Wall Street could be tarnished for years . But sources close to Mr. Bell indicate he is likely to call for disciplinary action against a number of middle-level and branch managers who were involved in the firm ' s money management operations . <> <> Some Early Results // Mr. Bell would not indicate specifically what his findings would be . But he did outline some general results of the investigation thus far . He said , for instance , that it appears that no top Hutton officials knowingly approved or promoted any of the illegal overdrafting . But he said that some middle-level executives engaged in the money management side of the firm likely knew that what they were doing was outside the law. // At the same time , he indicated that he had uncovered incidents where certain top managers were lax in their duties because they should have looked into their subordinates ' activities and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlanta law firm of King &; Spalding , also said that the overdrafting scheme did not involve as many of Hutton ' s 300 branches as he originally thought - only between 20 and 30. // Moreover , he believes that Hutton gave the Justice Deparment " too generous " a settlement , when it pleaded guilty on May 2 to 2 , 000 counts of mail and wire fraud . " That ' s an incredible number for a major securities firm , " he said . " I think Hutton just wanted to get the whole thing behind it and thought it would end with the plea . " <> <> A Rare Position // All of Hutton ' s doors have been opened to Mr. Bell , and he occupies the unique position of final judge and arbiter over Hutton ' s overdrafting past . Such a position of influence and power by an outsider is rare , indeed . " If someone won ' t give me something , I just call up Bob Fomon and it ' s done , " Mr. Bell said. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure that he and his colleagues had taken . " We started from the bottom up , " he said , adding that so far his team had quizzed about 300 managers , cashiers , operating officers and other employees at more than 100 of Hutton ' s branches. // The next step was Hutton ' s 9 regional offices in this country , and the Bell lawyers spoke with 35 vice presidents , managers and cashiers at those offices. // Mr. Bell also interviewed a former Hutton president , George L. Ball , now president of Prudential-Bache Securities . Several memorandums released by the House Judiciary Committee , which is investigating the case , indicated that Mr. Ball had encouraged the overdrafting of Hutton bank accounts to generate interest profits . Mr. Ball has repeatedly said , however , that he never encouraged any illegal overdrafting activity. // Mr. Bell ' s so-called Banking Team so far has interviewed 60 banks , 8 of which are money-center banks including Bank of America , Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover. // " I had a feeling that a lot of these banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I was right . " He added that his colleagues had found that all the money-center banks were aware of Hutton ' s overdrafting practices , " but they just did not know how extensive it was. " // Attorneys close to the Hutton matter acknowledge that people inside and outside of Hutton are worried about Mr. Bell ' s findings and recommendations . " He is going to get some people fired , and could well ruin the careers of those who are no longer at Hutton , " a Wall Street lawyer said . " Plenty of people have knots in their stomachs.
