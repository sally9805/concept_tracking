PITTSBURGH  --  Allegheny International Inc. directors are expected to decide today whether to be acquired by Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette Securities Corp. or come up with a fresh plan to remain independent . Donaldson Lufkin has the only offer on the table , after allying itself with a former rival , a New York merchant-banking group led by Paul S. Levy , Angus C. Littlejohn , Jr. and Peter A. Joseph . The board originally planned to meet yesterday to mull competing offers for the consumer-products company . Allegheny is operating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code , in which it is protected from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts . The two bidders agreed late Sunday to a plan in which the Levy group would buy Allegheny ' s profitable lawn-patio and gas-grill business for about $250 million , leaving the remainder  --  including the familiar Sunbeam and Oster appliance businesses  --  with Donaldson Lufkin . Although most groups involved in the company ' s bankruptcy proceedings seem to favor the latest development , it isn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shedding summer-related businesses that complement Allegheny ' s winter-product line of small appliances and electric blankets . Director Joshua Angel said the meeting was delayed to give investment bankers time to study the latest development . " I don ' t want to give the impression that there ' s tremendous groundswell to chuck the whole thing and try something else , " he said . " At the same time , I don ' t want to say it ' s not possible . " Likewise , the equity committee is concerned . Gary Blum , who represents that group , said the committee favored Levy ' s approach of selling the poor-performing Sunbeam/Oster appliance business to raise needed cash . " This new proposal leaves Sunbeam Oster and takes out two profitable operations , " he said . The former rivals apparently began courting each other last week , when the Levy group found support among its sponsors slipping . Indeed , Irwin Jacobs , the largest common-stock holder , switched allegiance to Donaldson Lufkin . The marriage has obvious advantages . Donaldson Lufkin , a unit of Equitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Levy sale to reduce debt . That would help silence criticism against Donaldson Lufkin ' s earlier plan , which was valued at $811. 9 million , and left the company essentially whole and highly leveraged . The gain on the sale would be sheltered by Allegheny ' s tax-loss carry-forwards . " I think we ' ve addressed any concerns about leverage by deleveraging the company , " said Lawrence Schloss , a senior vice president of Donaldson Lufkin . " We ' ve taken the best from both plans . " The Levy group is left with two businesses it favored all along . Under the new plan , the group could continue selling grills under the Sunbeam name for three years . The board had been directed by the U.S. bankruptcy court to submit a definitive merger agreement at a hearing tomorrow . If the board doesn ' t submit a plan , its creditor groups are expected to get together and file their own plan , which would most likely involve Donaldson Lufkin . " Everyone feels the debtor Allegheny has had plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross , of Rothschild Inc. , who has been advising the unsecured creditors . " If it can ' t , other parties will .
