" It 's not that I ca n't help these people , " says Lawrence Bourne III as he steps off the plane in sunny Thailand one day in 1962 . " It 's just that I do n't want to . " <P> Lawrence ( Tom Hanks ) can perhaps be excused his momentary petulance . After all , he has been forced to borrow his roommate 's identity and Peace Corps credentials and flee Far Eastward to escape gambling debts on the very night of his Yale graduation . Why , he is still wearing his dinner jacket . His first seatmate on the flight has been " Tom Tuttle from Tacoma " ( John Candy ) , who reads books about maximizing his potential capital-wise and is the most egregious go-getter since Babbitt . His next is Beth Wexler ( Rita Wilson ) , who rejects a night and a day of advances , to Lawrence 's immense puzzlement ( " I do think I 've put in the hours , do n't you ? " ) . The rest of this ship of idealists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing-along favorites like Puff the Magic Dragon . <P> No , one would not say that Lawrence and the Peace Corps were made for each other . Still , if one is far up-country without a paddle , there is a lot to be said for the kind of unfazable aplomb that only generations of inherited wealth and socially impeccable inbreeding can produce . Tom is captured and brainwashed by the local guerrillas in a test of wills that ends in a draw , with Tom reciting Chairman Mao 's aphorisms ( they sound like the text of a self-help book to him ) , his tormentors marching into battle singing the Washington State fight song ( which sounds martial to them ) . Beth is abducted by a mad CIA operative and offered as harem material to the nearest warlord- opium smuggler-defender of democracy . But Lawrence has time to save Tom 's soul and Beth 's body , open a nightclub , direct the hearts and minds of the natives as they build a bridge they do not need and teach them how to play New England baseball ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for white men " ) . He even has the wit and gumption to prevent his new span from being captured by convergent , divergent armies . <P> Hanks has devised a snooty accent ( he sounds as if he were born with a silver potato in his mouth ) and a way of likably parodying almost Ayn Randian selfishness . Candy again shows that he is a resourceful character comedian . Wilson neatly captures the priggish whine of middle-class idealism and its potential for redemption through experience and common sense . Each reflects the controlling intelligence of the film 's writers and director , who want to celebrate the antic resourcefulness of American individualism while satirizing the gaseous platitudes that are too often used to motivate and justify it and sometimes corrupt it . Their work may have the broad manner ( and the marketing strategy ) of a teen pic , but do not be misled . One has to have lived through the early ' 60s to appreciate what a good , smart comedy Volunteers is.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
