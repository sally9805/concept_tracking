Long lines at the movies <P> In most industries , 1982 was either bad , disastrous or forget-it . But for once Hollywood was not playing follow-the-leader , and the movie business had its biggest earnings ever . Ticket sales reached a 21-year high of nearly 1.2 billion , up 9% from 1981 , and a preliminary estimate puts box-office grosses at a record $3.4 billion . The final two weeks of the year witnessed an explosion in receipts , with Tootsie the hottest current picture , bringing in $11.2 million over the New Year 's weekend . <P> The top grosser for the entire year was , of course , E.T. , which ran up $322 million through Jan. 2 and by now may have displaced Star Wars ( $325 million ) as the biggest moneymaker of all time . Several light-years behind were the rest of the year 's top ten : On Golden Pond ( $120 million ) , Rocky III ( $119 million ) , An Officer and a Gentleman ( $109 million ) , Porky 's ( $107 million ) , Star Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas ( $74.5 million ) , Poltergeist ( $74 million ) , Chariots of Fire ( $62 million ) and Annie ( $58 million ) . <P> Hollywood executives are now scurrying around , looking for clues so they can make 1983 into a Bonanza II . But the truth is that there probably are no explanations . It was just one of those years . " It 's simple , " says Barry Diller , chairman of Paramount Pictures . " Are there movies people are interested in seeing or are n't there ? The business is not affected by recession , depression or inflation . It is just affected by movies . In 1982 there were more movies people wanted to see than in other years . "
