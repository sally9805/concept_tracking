 | Shipyards in Spain are joining with their French and Norwegian counterparts in a $56 million venture to develop three prototypes of high-tech fishing boats . The vessels are expected to be maritime marvels of electronics , labor-saving devices and crew comforts . But even more , they 're shaping up as political marvels : They ? and over 100 other technologically ambitious and costly projects ? comprise a 19-nation European effort , uniquely cooperative and unbureaucratic , named Eureka . It was ignited in 1985 by European anxieties over the innovative zip that pursuit of Star Wars technologies may be infusing into American industry . Compounding those fears were recollections of the ' 60s brain drain to the U.S. , set off by bountiful budgets and exciting opportunities of the Apollo moon-landing project . Eureka was Europe 's response . Sold hard by French President Mitterrand to initially skeptical European partners , it exists alongside an Old World technological landscape that can boast some successes but that 's also cluttered with many failed or faltering top-heavy efforts at transnational collaboration . Just 18 months after Eureka formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and venture capitalist for some $5 billion worth of high-tech industrial projects involving both the smallest and largest of firms in Europe . Financially , it is already Europe 's biggest multinational undertaking , exceeding even the Ariane rocket program . Eureka 's projects include a $60 million collaboration involving firms in France , Germany , the Netherlands and Britain to develop new automotive materials , such as ceramics to be used in engines and superplastics for body parts . There 's $15.5 million , contributed by France , Germany , Italy , Sweden and Britain , to start an eight-year project to develop electronic-guidance systems that would control traffic by giving drivers warning of road and weather conditions , and someday even taking direct control of the car . Realizing they may have hit on a charmed formula , the Eureka club has explicitly decided to try to capture a competitive edge for industries only of Western Europe . The membership has been capped at 19 nations , plus the European Economic Community as a single entity . The group 's reach extends from Iceland to Turkey , and Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , China , Hungary ? an Eastern-bloc nation ? and India . Given that 100 projects and $5 billion spread over several years is petty cash in the world 's industrial-research accounts , why has Eureka stirred up such unusual interest ? The answer , according to Manfred Cziesla , the Paris-based representative of the U.S. National Science Foundation , is that Eureka is virtually free of government control even though it gets half its money from its members ' governments . That is unlike previous European efforts to pool technological talents . The ideas for Eureka projects , he explains , come " from the bottom up " ? that is , from industrial firms rather than in response to government or Common Market invitations to bid for contracts . Cziesla also notes that Eureka focuses squarely on the marketplace . The Common Market 's collaborative efforts , by contrast , emphasize " precompetitive " research . Finally , observes Cziesla , Eureka 's ground rules are simple : A project must originate with an industrial firm and must also involve at least one other firm in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but industry is the initiator and the home base . The governments of the industrial partners kick in roughly half the costs , usually on the say-so of a single reviewer . But Europe 's often cumbersome government research agencies do n't initiate the projects and are only rarely involved . Europe 's aviation , space and electronics industries have long cooperated ? with government assistance ? across national borders . But credit for extending the concept to all industry goes to Yves Sillard , a veteran French research administrator . Former head of the French space agency and currently director-general of the French Center for Oceanographic Research , Sillard serves as the national coordinator for French participation , for which Mitterrand set aside an initial budget of $130 million . French participation now extends to over 60 projects . Although Star Wars provided the psychological spur for Eureka , now , says Sillard , the project is accelerating ? not from fear , but from wide recognition that it is a boon to European competitiveness . " We will have 200 to 300 projects going within the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Eureka is no longer seen as just a way to pool the research talents of diverse nations . " It 's creating something new in Europe ? an open technical process . Previously , there was little standardization and each country would look to its own little markets . But with Eureka , from the very beginning of product development , the companies think internationally . " At Matra , a 28,000-employe French corporation and one of Europe 's biggest high-tech industrial conglomerates , Eureka is " not a strategy , but a way to get problems solved , " says Victor Waknine , assistant technical manager in the firm 's research-and-technology directorate . Under Eureka , Matra is collaborating with an Italian firm to develop mobile robots for public-safety missions , such as rescues from fires . It is working with a Norwegian firm on minicomputer research and is also a partner in the electronic-highway project . " Eureka is a small part of Matra , " Waknine says , " but lack of cooperation is a serious weakness in Europe , and Eureka helps meet that problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity is one of Eureka 's frequently mentioned lures . The central staff consists of about six people in Brussels . Decision-making authority remains with member countries . " You need only convince one or two guys to get government support for a project , " says Georges MordchellesRegnier , general director of Bertin &; Company , one of Europe 's largest industrial-research consulting firms . Compared with the legendary complexities of the Common Market 's Brussels bureaucracy , Mordchelles-Regnier observes : " The nice thing about Eureka is that it 's not a system . It 's a label . " The wide and favorable attention given this fledgling venture reflects Europe 's anemic performance in advanced industrial competition around the world . Its computer markets are dominated by American and , increasingly , Asian products . Across the board , the Continent 's growth rate in output of high-tech products has lagged behind that of the U.S. and Japan for 15 years . Thus , Europe 's embrace of Eureka is unsurprising . The industrial malaise it seeks to counter may run so deep as to be beyond remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : With political support for the Strategic Defense Initiative on the decline , Eureka may turn out to be SDI 's principal legacy .
