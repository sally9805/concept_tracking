Excerpts from the address delivered at St. Paul 's Cathedral by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Robert Runcie : <P> " Here is the stuff of which fairy tales are made : the Prince and Princess on their wedding day . But fairy tales usually end at this point with the simple phrase ' They lived happily ever after . ' This may be because fairy tales regard marriage as an anticlimax after the romance of courtship . This is not the Christian view . Our faith sees the wedding day not as the place of arrival but the place where the adventure really begins ... <P> " Marriage is first of all a new creation for the partners themselves ... But any marriage which is turned in upon itself , in which the bride and groom simply gaze obsessively at one another , goes sour after a time . A marriage which really works is one which works for others ... If we solved all our economic problems and failed to build loving families , it would profit us nothing , because the family is the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed . <P> " Those who are married live happily ever after the wedding day if they persevere in the real adventure , which is the royal task of creating each other and creating a more loving world ... All couples on their wedding day are ' royal couples ' and stand for the truth that we help to shape this world and are not just its victims ... <P> " This is our prayer for Charles and Diana . May the burdens we lay on them be matched by the love with which we support them in the years to come . And however long they live , may they always know that when they pledged themselves to each other before the altar of God , they were surrounded and supported not by mere spectators but by the sincere affection and active prayer of millions of friends . Thanks be to God . "
