But as the clubs approach their first playoff meeting ever in the American Conference wild-card game at 4 P.M. Saturday at Giants Stadium with identical 11-5 records and similar reasons for feeling good , there is one obvious difference between the two . On one team the coach was changed and on the other the coach changed the players. // Both teams have been hounded by the same kind of reputation virtually since they began life together in the American Football League in 1960 : good personnel , bad attitude . Win on paper , lose on the field. // Now , though , they are wild cards , and one of them will face the Los Angeles Raiders in an American Conference semifinal on Jan. 5 . <> <> ' We All Came Together as One ' // " This year we all came together as one , " said the Patriots ' ninth-year cornerback , Ray Clayborn . " You can credit Coach Raymond Berry . We didn ' t play as 45 individuals . " During the middle of last season , Berry , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jets the week before their game against the Patriots . He missed that engagement and was instead named coach of the Patriots to replace Ron Meyer . In Berry ' s first game , the Patriots beat the Jets. // To the Patriots ' general manager , Patrick Sullivan , " the team was either too high or too low " before Berry arrived. // " The things that he did helped bring us together , " said Clayborn . " He ' s brought us into meetings as a group . The offense watched films of the defense and the defense watched the offense . We ' d all watch the special teams . He would tell us as a group what we have to do in a particular game. " // The Patriots , perhaps undeservedly , had gained a reputation for folding in some situations . They have still never won an overtime game . When the Jets stopped them , 16-13 , at Giants Stadium last month , it marked the Patriots ' eighth loss in such games . <> <> Reputation Called a Myth // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a lot of our reputation was a myth . I guess because we had so many first-round draft picks , people thought we should have the best teams. " // Starting in 1976 , the Patriots began hoarding draft picks - they have had 16 first-round choices in 10 seasons . Yet , this will be only their sixth playoff game , and only the fourth since all the No. 1 picks began piling up. // Meanwhile , the Jets amassed 12 first-round picks , but this will be only their third playoff appearance in that span , and only the eighth playoff game since their first postseason appearance in the Super Bowl season of 1968. // The Jets have said that their coach , Joe Walton , lightened up , too . Joe Fields , who has more time on the club than Walton , said the coach has learned to accept a defeat without being a tyrannical accuser in the meeting rooms the next day. // Walton is not so sure this is exactly the reason he has changed , or if he has even changed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of ballplayer that he is comfortable with . The Patriots ' defensive stars will need the most attention from the Jets . They include Andre Tippett , perhaps the most respected linebacker in the A.F.C. and leading sacker with 16. 5. // Clayborn is another concern at cornerback against the Jets ' wide receivers , and Steve Nelson , the inside left linebacker , will be watching for Freeman McNeil. // Tippett and Company sacked Ken O ' Brien 11 times in the clubs ' two previous meetings this season and also limited the Jets ' running game . The Patriots won the first game , 20-13 , then lost the second in overtime , 16-13. // Johnny Hector appeared for an injured McNeil the first time the clubs met , and it took him 21 carries to get 80 yards . In fact , it was the Jets ' poorest rushsing day of the season - only 83 yards . <> <> Hector Replaced McNeil // In the teams ' last meeting , Hector replaced McNeil after the first quarter . That game , Jets ' rushers totaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 29 carries. // The Jets ' running game may not be any healthier Saturday , even with McNeil . He was unable to practice Wednesday because of a bruised left knee. // That could require an adroit short passing game from O ' Brien , who is likely to produce half-rollouts to avoid the Patriots ' rush . With kickoff at at 4 P.M. , the temperature should fall into the 20 ' s by the second half and the wind will be whipping . For half the game , neither quarterback will be able to produce deep passes. // In the Jets ' last two games at Giants Stadium , against the Bears and the Browns , the weather played a factor in limiting Wesley Walker to only one catch in each game , and Al Toon was held to an average of fewer than 8 yards a reception. // But in the two games against the Patriots earlier this season , Walker snared 12 passes for 308 yards and was effective against Clayborn . <> <> Jet Offense Could Suffer // If McNeil continues the relatively ineffective running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather combines with the the dangerous Patriots ' rush to force a short-passing game , the Jets ' offense would suffer. // Yet , the Patriots ' offense would be facing the same sort of pressures even though Tony Eason at quarterback creates different types of problems for the Jets ' defense . It is a highly intelligent defense , led by Joe Klecko at nose tackle. // The Patriots have been able to run in recent weeks - 281 yards against Cincinnati , 122 against Miami , 216 against Detroit , 136 against the Colts and 174 against the Jets. // Eason started 11 games this season and Steve Grogan , now injured , the other five . With Eason there is less of a long-ball threat . Tony Collins , a running back , is the club ' s leading receiver . Thirty-eight of his 52 receptions have come from Eason . Derrick Ramsey is the team ' s leading tight end . Of his 29 catches , Eason has thrown 25. // The Patriots do have two long-ball receivers in Stanley Morgan , averaging 19. 5 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  Carter Expected to Play Russell Carter worked at right cornerback for the Jets on Thursday , indicating he is likely to be activated Friday and start there in the game . Carter , considered the club ' s top defensive back , has been on injured reserve , but a playoff team is entitled to one free move off the list. //
