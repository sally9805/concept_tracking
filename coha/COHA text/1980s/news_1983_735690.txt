Coleco 's Adam system , which prompted all the scrambling , is an all-in-one computer system selling for . only $600 . It includes , for the first time in the home-computer field , all the peripherals like word-processing software and a printer that are usually bought separately .

" Because the Adam will be shipped in August , competitors must move fast if they are to revamp their strategies . Some fast thinking apparently was already taking place at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago . a big showcase for low-cost computers and other products that ended yesterday . One microcomputer that was shipped to the show never even made it out of its box and onto the exhibition floor .

It says it will offer more famous-name programs for its Commodore 64 and VIC 20 computers within the next 60 days . One program Commodore has already announced is Microsoft Inc.

It said that one , the model 600XL , will be sold in a special WO package with a letter-quality printer twice as fast as the one on Coleco 's Adam .
