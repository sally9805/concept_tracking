Hans Werner Henze 's opera We Come to the River is stunning <P> It is an astonishing theatrical tour de force , sprawling across three stages and accompanied by three orchestras . The essentially atonal score nevertheless embraces a variety of styles , including a show-stopping military march . The libretto is one of the harshest antiwar tracts in all of opera , a soldier 's tale of unrelieved brutality that opens in a battlefield slaughterhouse and ends with violent death in a madhouse . <P> Technically dazzling , emotionally searing , although ideologically bathetic , Hans Werner Henze 's We Come to the River has just been given its American premiere by the Santa Fe Opera , eight years after its first performance in London . It was a welcome event : the prolific German-born Marxist composer , 58 , has created one of the postwar period 's most accomplished operas . <P> We Come to the River is set to an original text by British Playwright Edward Bond . The principal themes-the evils of fascism and the brotherhood of the masses-are ones that Henze has previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1968 ) and El Cimarrn ( 1969-70 ) , written in Cuba . " New museums , opera houses and premieres are not necessary , " Henze declared in 1967 . " What is necessary is. . . the greatest work of art of mankind : the world revolution . " <P> Brave words , if not wise ones . But Henze , a sybaritic socialist with a well-developed taste for capitalist pleasures , has never let politics stand in the way of artistic success . He excoriates the Nazis , the treatment of blacks in the South and the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima , while overlooking such evils as Stalin 's Gulag . Yet the opera 's blinkered world view is secondary to its musical and dramatic substance-for the audience and , perhaps , for the composer as well . <P> The setting is an imaginary empire . An abortive revolution has been quelled by the General ( Baritone Victor Braun ) . A deserter is executed ; later , his wife and her mother , who have been looting corpses in order to survive , are also shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imprisoned in an insane asylum . There the inhabitants obsessively recite litanies of violence as they tear their hair and rend their clothes . When the General once again refuses an order to take the field on behalf of king and country , his eyes are put out . Images of his victims appear before the blinded General ; frightened , the asylum 's inmates kill him , while ghosts of the liberated dead sing a hymn to the revolution : " We stand by the river. / If the water is deep we will swim. / If it is too fast we will build boats. / We will stand on the other side. / We have learned to march so well/ That we can not drown .
