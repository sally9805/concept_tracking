In the last two-year legislative session , more than 23 , 000 bills were introduced , but only 1 , 992 became law . Because many of the others were frivolous , the assemblymen say , they want to limit the number of bills each legislator may introduce. // Of course , every legislator has good reasons for his own bills , even the ones with little or no chance of passing . Still , to their colleagues , some of these bills seem a little , well , offbeat : // // Butterfly vs . Ladybug // At the urging of an elementary school class in Guilderland , Assemblyman Michael Hoblock has introduced a bill to confer upon the Karner blue butterfly - known scientifically as the Lycaeides melissa samuelis - the title of official New York State insect. // The butterfly , which is on the national list of endangered species , has been sighted in only one place in New York State , the Pine Bush area of Albany and the neighboring communities of Colonie and Guilderland . ( It has also been seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butterfly feeds only on certain species of pine trees , found in New York only in the Pine Bush forest area . The butterfly received its name from Karner Road , which cuts through the area. // But the Karner blue has a rival . A group of fourth graders at a school in Assemblyman Robert C. Wertz ' s district wrote him plugging for the ladybug as state insect . Mr. Wertz , a Smithtown , L.I. , Republican , obliged and introduced Assembly Bill 561. // An aide to Mr. Wertz said the introduction of the bill served a useful purpose : helping the schoolchildren learn about the legislative process . <> <> New Plates for Firefighters // A bill introduced by State Senator Owen H. Johnson , a Republican of Babylon , L.I. , would amend the existing state vehicle and traffic law to allow distinctive license plates for volunteer firefighters . The license plates would be decorated with the symbol of the Maltese cross and the letters " V.F. " // Ginny Brown , an aide to Mr. Johnson , said these plates would give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily identified at the scene of a fire . <> <> One Day of Fireworks // Another bill , one that is expected to pass , has an effective lifetime of a single day . It would allow fireworks to be shot off from the Brooklyn Bridge on May 24 , 1983 , the day of the bridge ' s centenary celebration. // Senator John J. Marchi , a Republican of Staten Island , introduced the bill at the request of New York City . The law now forbids fireworks displays 200 feet from a public highway . The bridge is just such a roadway , and so an exception must be made to permit fireworks as part of the planned gala celebration , according to Jerry McLaughlin , an aide to the Senator . <> <> Playing With Numbers // Legislators may " reserve " bills by requesting a certain number for them , and many legislators infuse the process of introducing a bill with a bit of humor , or even the odd literary allusion. // For years , a bill eliminating mandatory retirement in the Assembly has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optometry was Assembly Bill 2020 . And this year , beside the space for Bill 1984 , the legislative index notes " reserved. " // Inquiries about the sponsor of the bill were met at first with cautious silence , and then Assemblyman Joseph Ferris , a Democrat of Brooklyn , called to claim his number . His staff is preparing a bill that will receive the designation Assembly Bill 1984 . It deals , he said , with " personal privacy . " <> <> Chewing Tobacco // Although the sale of chewing tobacco to minors is already against the law , Assemblyman Jose E. Serrano , a Democrat of the Bronx , has introduced a bill to jog merchants ' memory . Merchants are now required to post a sign stating that the sale of cigars , cigarettes and tobacco products to minors is forbidden by law . Mr. Serrano ' s bill would add the words " chewing and powdered tobacco " to such signs , and would increase fines for such sales from $50 to $100 , with $250 for subsequent offenses. // " What we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gene DeSantis , an aide to Mr. Serrano . " The products are marketed in such a way as to make them seem like candy or healthful products . " <> <> Bill on Bills // And so we come to the bill on bills . Assemblyman William E. Bush , a Republican of Camillus , thinks the practice of introducing a bill to appease constituents or make a political statement is getting to be too expensive a luxury . Each bill introduced last year , he said , cost taxpayers about $540 , including printing , drafting and staff expenses. // In New York State , printing the bills alone cost a total of $1. 8 million in the 1981-82 session , and preparing the weekly legislative index that lists bills introduced cost another $1. 8 million . The Bill Drafting Commission , which drafts , typesets and proofreads bills , spent $9. 3 million over the last two years , Mr. Bush said. // Mr. Bush ' s proposal would restrict the number of bills a legislator could introduce to 35 for an assemblyman and 50 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced last session was Edward Abramson , a Democrat of Queens , with three . Assemblyman Maurice D. Hinchey Jr. , a Democrat of Saugerties , led the legislators with 210. // " These additional bills are not providing any drastic new legislation , " Mr. Bush said . " They ' re really an exercise in public relations. " // Mr. Bush estimated that his bill could cut costs by about 25 percent , or about $3 million . But David Keiper of the Bill Drafting Commission was more skeptical . Over a two-year period , the bill would allow legislators to introduce 16 , 600 bills , and the Governor and the Rules Committes of both houses also introduce bills - about 2 , 000 in the last legislative session . " It would hardly make any difference , " Mr. Keiper said. // And it may be that Mr. Bush ' s bill falls under the heading of one introduced to make a political point . It has only Republican sponsors in an Assembly controlled by the Democrats , and so far , there is no comparable bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , too , seems to have little chance of passing. //
