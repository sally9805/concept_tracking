From " Thank Heaven for 7-11 , " by Henry Rollins , in the June issue of Spin , a new music magazine published in New York . Rollins is lead singer for Black Flag , a Los Angeles band . Look , I do n't know you , you do n't know me , we do n't go to the same parties , never tubbed together . I know you think I 'm some kind of weirdo , but listen ... I bet , just bet , you and 1 have one thing in common , one thing that unites us , one thing that will allow us to look each other in the eye and feel right . Yes , friend ... 7-Eleven . They 're in your town , they 're in my town , we have both seen the orange , white , and green beacon against the night sky . What 's your thing ? Coffee , video games , microwave food ? You want somethin ' ? They got somethin ' you want , and that is good . I joined Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through the United States and Canada . Things that spring to mind ? Austin , Texas , near the university hospital ; if you get in the right spot , you can see three 7-Elevens at once ; I can proudly say that I. have been to all three . Edmonton , Canada : two 7-Elevens open right across the street from each other . Needless to say , I checked out both . Here 's a little story for you from my journal . 1/30/85 , Hermosa Beach , California : " I wonder if the people who work the graveyard shift at the 7-Eleven on Artesian and Prospect are cops . They probably get in real good with the students at Mira Costa High and then try and bust them for pot or something . You go in there and tell me what you think . Maybe 7-Elevens are headquarters for police surveillance ! " Here 's another 7-Eleven story from Southern California , but it might as well be from Madison , Wisconsin . 2/13/85 , Hermosa Beach . California : " Saw a kid rip off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slick mover , that kid . He bent down , lifted his pant leg , and bailed out of the store . Kids hanging out wearing Iron Maiden T-shirts and playing video games ; someday , they will stand behind the counter . Now it 's just a dream . Is n't it everybody 's dream ? To don that orange and beige smock , to stand with your feet planted solidly , facing front proudly , turning only to fill an order for a Big Gulp or a Slurpee ? ( Oh , 7-Eleven man , it 's 4:00 A.M. ? who can we turn to now but you ? ) 7-Eleven is the pulsebeat of America . I think Bruce Springsteen should do a song about a 7-Eleven in Asbury Park , New Jersey , but write it in such a way that all America 's youth can identify and slurp along with the Boss . Hail the Boss ! Hail 7-Eleven ! " got ta ask ya ? what happens to people ? They turn New Wave , they move away , they mate , they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashes , they get lucky , they get stabbed , they ger rich , they go crazy , they go to Philadelphia and never return , etc . O.K. , the girls and boys in Beverly Hills are no different from the ones in Harlem . They may smile a little more , but they have the same needs . Fine , there are no sushi bars in the ghetto and no pawnshops in the land of " charge it " youth . but there is 7-Eleven . You notice that I did n't say , " There are 7-Elevens . " I meant that . 7-Eleven is more than a store , more than an institution , more than a way of life . It 's ? it 's totally cosmic , dude . Like , bigger than Thriller . At this point you 're probably asking yourself , " What 's this slob getting at and what does he want from me ? " What I 'm getting at is this : in this age of trials and tribulations , of terror and turmoil of the soul , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a place we can go to still the agitated waters of our hearts . Friends , it 's bigger than both of us . No , not Prince , not U.S. Steel : 7-Eleven . How many people can you depend on seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day ? Cyndi Lauper ? Nastassja Kinski ? Do they have a sixteen-ounce coffee with your name on it ? They would n't even give me the time of day , much less a crack at their Pac-Man machine . Friends , the answer is a simple one-it 's 7-Eleven . The panacea , the common chord that resonates deep within all of us , is 7-Eleven . That 's why 7-Elevens are springing up all over , rising to the cries of a nation that needs to feel good about itself again . Brothers and sisters , salvation is at hand .
