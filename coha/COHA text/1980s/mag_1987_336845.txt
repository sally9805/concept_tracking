Two years ago Justin Suddeth , then 14 , found a deformed , nine-legged frog at a pond near the Sequoyah Fuels plant in Gore , Okla . In 1981 an eyeless baby girl was born to parents living a few miles from the same plant . The National Cancer Institute has reported that the leukemia rate for white men in counties surrounding Sequoyah Fuels is five percentage points higher than the national average . Is there a connection ? Local residents think so : Sequoyah Fuels processes uranium concentrate into ingredients for bombs and nuclear-power- plan t fuel . The factory has been cited in the past for safety lapses , including a 1986 leak that killed one worker and released toxic uranium hexafluoride gas into the environment . Moreover , it is owned by Kerr-McGee , the Oklahoma City-based company implicated in the radioactive contamination of 73 workers at another facility  --  the case uncovered in 1974 by the late Karen Silkwood . <P> But if Kerr-McGee hoped its $1.38 million settlement with Silkwood 's heirs had lifted the cloud of controversy from its operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spate of news reports revealed that Sequoyah has for more than a decade , with Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) approval , been converting radioactive wastewater , called raffinate , into fertilizer and spraying it over company-owned fields . Hay grown on the fields has then been sold as feed to farmers and ranchers . Nearby residents charge that the fertilizer may be contaminating the Arkansas River and the water table near the Oklahoma-Arkansas border . Local Veterinarian Gary Johnson is concerned that the " hay is getting into the food chain . " Jessie Deer In Water , who chairs the local Native Americans for a Clean Environment , calls it the " ultimate in cheap waste disposal . " <P> Nonsense , responds Kerr-McGee Spokesman Rick Pereles . " Our product is no more dangerous than normal fertilizer . " Indeed , company tests show the substance to be no higher in radioactivity or most toxic heavy metals than many other fertilizers . Aberrations like the freak frog occur naturally , note company officials ; no one has conclusively linked the product to environmental or health problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1973 by chemically removing most of the uranium and heavy metals and adding potash and phosphate during application . The liquid was first tested on small plots of company land . In the early 1980s the NRC , finding " no adverse environmental impacts , " authorized more widespread testing . That assessment was circulated to the Food and Drug Administration , the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture , and each passed it with no comments .
