Two university laboratories duplicated different portions of the controversial University of Utah experiment that is claimed to produce more energy than it consumes . But the new experiments further deepened the mystery of exactly what process is at work . The excess energy is produced by running an electric current through palladium rods that are immersed in " heavy " water in which the hydrogen atoms are deuterium  --  a " heavy " form of hydrogen . Researchers at Texas A &; University in College Station said they had measured excess heat coming from tiny palladium rods in a test tube apparatus . The measurements , they said , thereby confirm the Utah scientist ' s claim that the palladium-heavy water devices will produce more energy , as heat , than they consume as electricity . Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta said they had detected neutrons coming out of a palladium-heavy water apparatus , thereby confirming the Utah claims that the fusion of deuterium atoms does take place inside the palladium rods . Neither experiment , however , was intended to determine , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah experiments , if any , was coming from the fusion of deuterium atoms . Although the Utah scientists have claimed nuclear fusion occurred in their experiments , they have also asserted repeatedly that known hydrogen fusion reactions couldn ' t account for most of the energy coming out of the palladium devices . Researchers at Texas A &; announced at a news conference that they were getting 60% to 80% more energy , as heat , out of a small palladium rod than was being put into the rod as electricity . They said they began getting heat from the palladium device within 20 minutes after they started the experiment three days ago , and that the device has been consistently producing excess heat ever since . Texas thermodynamicist Kenneth Marsh and electrochemist Charles Martin said so far they have measured only the heat emitted by the test tube apparatus . Other devices are now in operation in nuclear laboratories on the A &; campus to determine if the palladium devices also emit neutrons , which would be evidence of fusion reactions . None of the researchers , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devices is coming from unknown nuclear reactions , as suggested by the Utah scientists , or from unknown chemical reactions . " The likelihood is probably very small , but I can not entirely dismiss the possibility that it is a chemical reaction , " Mr. Marsh declared . The Texas scientists called their heat measurements highly sensitive and accurate . In the experiment , a bath of water containing the heat measuring devices  --  calorimeters  --  was warmed by an electric heater to a constant temperature . The electric heater was then turned down and the palladium device turned on , allowing the heat from the palladium device to substitute for the heat from the electric heater . The researchers measured how much energy had to be poured into the palladium device to keep the water at the same constant temperature . The amount of energy poured into the palladium device was less than would have been required to keep the water warm by electrochemical reactions , explained Mr. Martin . Thus , he said , it was clear " there was another source of heat , " some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . " We don ' t know what it is and we can ' t say because we don ' t have the data , " he added . By ordinary standards , the temperatures involved were rather tepid , 27 degrees Celsius ( 80 degrees Fahrenheit ) in the water bath and 34 degrees Celsius ( 93 degrees Fahrenheit ) in the palladium device . The palladium rod used in the experiment was only one millimeter in diameter and five centimeters long , comparable with the ones used in some of the early experiments by B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and his colleague , Martin Fleischmann of Southampton University in England . In their latter experiments , Messrs . Pons and Fleischmann claimed they got four times as much energy out of a four millimeter by 10 centimeter palladium rod as they put into it . Some of their experiments also heated water to the boiling point . In Atlanta , at another news conference , a five-person research team led by James Mahaffey said it had learned how to treat palladium rods so they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the laboratory device . The neutron count jumped to 600 an hour from a normal background count of 40 , Mr. Mahaffey said . The team carried out the experiment at the Georgia Tech Research Institute , the contract research arm of the university . By comparison , Messrs . Pons and Fleischmann said they detected neutron counts about three times higher than normal background levels . The main purpose of the Georgia experiment , Mr. Mahaffey explained , was to confirm that fusion of deuterium atoms does take place in the palladium device , as Messrs . Pons and Fleischmann had claimed . The Georgia researchers didn ' t take measurements of heat output and " we don ' t want to speculate about that , " Mr. Mahaffey said . The Georgia researchers said they were able to get fusion reactions almost immediately because they first baked the palladium rod at about 600 degrees Celsius in a high vacuum . This forced hydrogen contaminates out of the rod and allowed it to absorb the deuterium atoms from the heavy water more efficiently . Messrs . Pons and Fleischmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palladium rod to soak up deuterium atoms before they began getting fusion reactions . In all the experiments , the test tube-sized devices have consisted of small rods of palladium metal surrounded by a spiral of platinum wires . The rods are then immersed in a beaker of heavy water and a current applied . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
