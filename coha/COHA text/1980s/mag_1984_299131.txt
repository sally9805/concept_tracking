Since Andrei Gromyko first appeared on the world scene as Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. during World War II , three generations of TIME correspondents have dogged the footsteps of this taciturn , publicity-shy diplomat . In Washington , at the United Nations and during almost every East-West crisis , reporters have waited , usually in vain , for the impenetrable Gromyko mask to slip . <P> TIME 'S current practitioners of the art of Kremlin watching are as persistent , and sometimes as frustrated , as their predecessors . Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott , whose behind-the-scenes narrative of the Reagan Administration 's conduct of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks is a large part of this week 's cover package , is a Sovietologist who began his TIME career as a summer trainee in the magazine 's Moscow bureau in 1969 . Last week Talbott , on his twelfth visit to the Soviet Union , filed his observations of the Soviet foreign policy process . He confesses to once having employed a small ruse in an effort to interview the close-mouthed Gromyko . During a 1978 Moscow meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyrus Vance , Talbott borrowed a camera and joined the photographers ' pool . " When Gromyko came near , " Talbott recalls , " I stepped forward , introduced myself and asked him a couple of questions . Gromyko 's answer : ' Nice to meet you , but this is not a press conference . ' " <P> To help report this week 's story on the new hard line in U.S.-Soviet relations , Moscow Bureau Chief Erik Amfitheatrof studied the record of the past and consulted dozens of Soviet and Western sources . He also drew on his on-the-scene experience of watching Gromyko at numerous Kremlin functions , including the receptions for foreign statesmen that followed the funerals of Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov . On those occasions , he reports , Gromyko lingered longer with East bloc allies and exchanged only perfunctory greetings with Western leaders . " The exception , " Amfitheatrof notes , " was Britain 's Margaret Thatcher , who seemed able to charm the grim-faced Foreign Minister . " <P> Amfitheatrof 's files , along with those of Washington Correspondent William Stewart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kremlinologists , went to Associate Editor John Kohan , who wrote the main story . Says Kohan , who speaks fluent Russian and has visited the Soviet Union six times : " It 's hard to remember , from my days in Leningrad as a student during detente , that the Russians once spoke confidently about good relations with the U.S. "
