THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE conclusion , within a matter of hours , of the two largest antitrust suits ever brought by the Department of Justice  --  those against the American Telephone &; Telegraph Company and the International Business Machines Corporation  --  surely makes Friday , January 8th , one of the landmark days in American business history . The withdrawal of the case against I.B.M . was straightforward : if , as Justice alleged , I.B.M . was indeed monopolizing the general-purpose computer market in 1969 , when the suit was brought , it assuredly is n't monopolizing it now ; the brainy and nervy Davids of the computer industry that have sprung up in the interim to harass the I.B , M. Goliath have made a mockery of the government case . The agreement between Justice and A.T . &T.; is another matter . Under it , A.T . &T.; keeps the Bell Laboratories , its research arm ; the Western Electric Company , its manufacturing arm ; and its long-distance telephone operations . Meanwhile , it agrees to divest itself within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for about two-thirds of its mind-boggling assets of almost one hundred and forty billion dollars , and which among them provide more than four-fifths of the nation 's telephone service . On its face , the A.T . &T.; agreement is a triumph for Justice : the dismantlement  --  or , at least , the bifurcation  --  of an economic behemoth ; the division of a company of unthinkable size into two or more companies of barely thinkable size . But is it a triumph for justice ? Perhaps , rather , it is the partial disassembling of a sound piece of corporate machinery , or even the defacing of something approximating a corporate work of art . In its early years , the Bell System was a legal monopoly based on Alexander Graham Bell 's patents , and a greedy and surly monopoly it often was . Beginning in 1894 , when the second of the two original Bell patents expired , competition ran rampant , and for a while after the turn of the century there were many cities with two telephone systems not only competing but unconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone to call the butcher and another to call the doctor . The butcher , of course , could n't call the doctor at all unless one of them had both phones . The confusion and inconvenience attendant on this arrangement were so great that eventually it came to be widely accepted that the provision of telephone service was a natural monopoly if there ever was one ; and in the first two decades of this century a series of deals was struck between Theodore N. Vail , A.T . &T.'s; tough but statesmanlike boss , and the federal and state governments , under which A.T . &T.; was allowed to operate as a monopoly serving most of the country in exchange for agreeing to submit to federal and state regulation of many of its activities , including the rates it charged . The peculiarly American hybrid of capitalism and socialism that emerged from these accommodations has racked up a pretty good record over the years . Frequently in touch with practically everybody in the country  --  unlike any other American company  --  and mostly in touch at moments when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often for good reason . It long had the reputation of being arbitrary with customers living in poor neighborhoods ; sometimes when it was refused the rate increases that it wanted it retaliated by deliberately degrading the quality of its service ; on rare occasions some of its executives were caught using illegal funds to influence regulation or legislation . Its stock , despite being the all-time champion favorite of widows and orphans or their trustees , does not have a particularly good performance record over the years ; but the stockholders ' loss has been the public 's gain , because the regulation of consumer rates was precisely what brought about the indifferent performance . Above all , over the years A.T . &T.; has provided generally better service at generally lower rates than the government-operated telephone systems in other countries . And now  --  assuming that the agreement is not overthrown by the courts or by Congress  --  A.T . &T.; is broken up , in the worthy name of antitrust . Of course , the government case , originally brought by Attorney General William Saxbe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based not on traditional wire-circuit telephone service but on entirely new technology , thought to be better adapted to competition , that has come along in the past twenty-five years . Probably technological change , rather than government insensitivity , should be blamed for whatever public losses result from the breakup . Nor was A.T . &T.; forced by a court judgment to split up . It agreed to do so , and presumably with a minimum of chagrin : it keeps its most profitable and most promising parts , gives up its less profitable ones , and will now be free to enter new competitive fields . ( A.T . &T.'s; common stock reacted initially to news of the settlement by jumping almost two points on huge volume . ) Considering that the anti- trust laws were and are intended to protect the little man or woman or small business against brute corporate power , there is irony in what the probable short-term effects of the breakup will he . Holders of the company 's stock are expected to profit , and the more they hold , the more they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deprived of past subsidies from A.T . &T.'s; more profitable operations , are expected to pay higher rates . Frequent users of long-distance service  --  presumably a more affluent group  --  may look forward to steady rates , or even to lower ones . And , finally , if Vail and his successors were right in their contention that a fully integrated nationwide system makes for the most efficient service , telephone users of all kinds in all parts of the country have reason to fear a deterioration in the quality of service . Goodbye , Ma Bell , you formidable , irascible , sometimes rash old centenarian ! You will be missed . w . III IAN1 ALFRLD , the playwright and Abbott Lawrence Lowell Professor of the Humanities at Haryard , is in town preparing for the opening of his new play , " The Curse of an Aching Heart , " starring Faye Dunaway , who appeared in Mr. Alfred 's first play , " Hogan 's Goat , " sixteen years ago . At that time , we spent an exhilarating afternoon with Mr. Alfred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had spent most of his pre-Harvard life , and which he loved . He had made the area the locale for " Hogan 's Goat , " which tells about an Irish Catholic couple in 1890 they had married out-side the Church and felt guilty about it ? and he has made the same area the locale for " The Curse of an Aching Heart , " which is about a Brooklyn woman of thirty-five ( the daughter of Josie Finn , the character who caused trouble for the Miss Dunaway character in " Hogan 's Goat " ) looking hack over her life between the nineteen-twenties and the nineteen-forties , the decade in which the play is set . This woman , as Mr. Alfred puts it , " comes to decide that her life has to it a daily glory . " Now we have had the pleasure of spending another afternoon with Mr. Alfred , this time in Manhattan , in the Lenox Hill area , where he lived between the ages of four and a half JANUARY 25 , 1982 and nine . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he was a day student , at St. Ann 's Academy , which used to be on East Seventy-sixth Street near Lexington . He attended Mass at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste , which is still at Lexington and East Seventy-sixth Street , and he moseyed around the Third Avenue shops with his father , a bricklayer , and his mother , a telephone operator , when they were n't working and had the time . Mr. Alfred keeps a second home  --  a tiny apartment  --  in this area , in addition to a house in Cambridge . The apartment is a very short walk away from the Church of St. jean Baptiste , where Mr. Alfred now attends Mass every morning on his way to the theatre for rehearsals of his play . This is what Mr. Alfred gave the press agent for " The Curse of an Aching Heart " to say about his new play : " Santayana once wrote that everything in nature is lyrical in its ideal essence , tragic in its fate , and comic in its existence . Being , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread the dance of those three rhythms of our lives . My hope is that The Curse of an Aching Heart ' occasionally captures that dazzle as water captures light . " I. Tnc APARTMFNT ATrims-.Ft oott walkup , over ( ) masher 's Bakery ( " Fresh Bread Daily " ) on the ground floor . Inside the building entrance , fading brown stencillike representations of flowers on mustard-colored walls . Rickety tile stairs . Rickety brown-painted door to the apartment . Mr. Alfred opening the door to us , looking only a hint affected by the passage of sixteen years : the same dark , ascetic face , the same large brown eyes , the same strong impression of innocence , deep humor , compassion , and good will . He was wearing a gray flannel suit , a dark-blue shirt with a button-down collar , a gray-and-blue striped poplin necktie . We stepped directly into a comforting little kitchen with a window . " I 'm making you a cup of tenement-house coffee , freshly perked , " he said . " I love the smell . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen was shining clean . A rectangular wooden table with oilcloth on the top . Under a hoard cover , a bathtub , old-fashioned , with legs like a puppy 's . Refrigerator and stove dollhouse size , but a full-sized percolator THE NEW YORKER on the stove . To the left of the kitchen , a diminutive bedroom . To the right , a living room only slightly larger , with sofa , floor-to-ceiling bookshelves , an armchair , an old blackand-white television set , a sewing table used as a desk . The room 's two windows , with a fire escape outside , looked out on other windows , other fire escapes . " It 's compact , like a ship , in here , " Alfred said . " It 's only a hole in the wall , but I love it . I love the neighborhood . I got the place right after my father died , eight years ago , for a hundred and seventy-five dollars , and today it 's only up to two hundred and ninety-five dollars and eighty cents . The landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I had my heart attack , in Cambridge , two years ago , my lease was up , and I told Mr. Braun I did n't know whether I 'd be coming hack , but he held the place for me without a lease , and he did n't raise the rent . " We had the coffee , out of delicate blue-and-white china cups , in the living room , at the sewing table . On the walls : a crucifix ; a Picasso print , in a brown wooden frame , of peasants in a field , resting ; a " Hogan 's Goat " poster featuring the name of Ed Begley ; a small eighteenth-century wash drawing of country musicians by Jean Baptiste Le Prince . " I think he did some of the murals for the Hermitage , " Mr. Alfred told us . " I found the painting in a thrift shop . I got it for twenty bucks . I got a genuine 1790 Coalport-china teapot in another thrift shop for only eighteen bucks . My mother loved china ; she collected it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody who is n't here anymore . I love the thrift shops . My mother loved them . They used to be all up and down Third Avenue . The best one was the one called Stuyvesant Square  --  it 's now moved over to Second . They ca n't pay the Third Avenue rents . We dressed out of the thrift shops . Beautiful things . We always had the most beautiful clothes . I bought this tie I 'm wearing in a thrift shop yesterday . Fifty cents . " Mr. Alfred laughed an openly joyful laugh . We picked up from the sewing table a small nineteenth-century clock in a gilded brass case , its works visible through glass , its face , with Roman numerals , enamelled in pale green . " Faye gave it to me for Christmas , " Mr. Alfred said . " It winds up with a key . It 's a travelling clock . Faye knows I used to collect clocks . " Mr. Alfred started packing some items into a dark-green Harvard book hag . " I 've been helping get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying each item before he packed it away . " The Staats-Zeitung and Herold , because there 's a man on the streetcar in the play who carries one . The paper still looks the same as it did fifty years ago . A bottle of toilet water ? Florida Water . I got them this brass shove with a black handle  --  brought it from Cambridge . My mother used this Louis Sherry candy box as a sewing box . I like to have things that are mine on the set . " Time to go . Mr. Alfred put on a black topcoat with a velvet collar and a worn-looking dark-gray fedora , and opened the door of his apartment . A heavy aroma strongly suggesting well-seasoned pot roast . " It 's from the apartment across the hall  --  my neighbor , a Hungarian lady , " Mr. Alfred said . " She 's always cooking . The smells drive you crazy . And in the kitchen you can see from my windows there 's a French couple . In the worst heat of summer , she cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and young in this building . Young people just making their way . Everybody friendly with everybody else , My laundry is William 's Chinese Laundry , on East Seventy-eighth , and I get my hair cut at Alfred 's Barber Shop , around the corner . Maybe I 'm getting loopy , but it helps make me feel I was meant to he here . " He laughed . Mr. Alfred left most of his lights on in the tiny apartment as he closed the door . " My mother would say , ' You 're making Edison rich , " ' he said . " But I like the lights on when I come home . It 's less lonesome . " II . THE CHURCH we emerged from Mr. Alfred 's building , the cold hit us like a sharp wallop . Mr. Alfred hunched his shoulders and led us a block west and a couple of blocks south , directing our attention to various points of dazzle on the way : the thrift shop where he got the Coalport teapot ; the top floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early nineteen-thirties , and where a young German called Willy did odd jobs for them and slept on a Cogswell chair and an ottoman in their living room , because it was during the Depression and " you took people into your home off the streets in those days ; " the bookshop with a fancy red drapery in the window which framed a fake ice-cream soda and a real begonia plant , and with books that included a " Special , $11 : 1Chandor 's Portraits ' by Malcolm Vaughan , Foreword by Deems Taylor ; " the Save on Income Tax Preparation shop ; the newspaper-delivery shop ; Ellen O'Neill 's Supply Store , with a window completely occupied by a mannequin wearing a long , Victorian white lace dress . " I have n't stopped teaching at Harvard during this rehearsal time , " Mr. Alfred told us . " Luckily , this is Reading Period  --  the time for the kids to consolidate what they have studied and to write their term papers . I 've read twenty-five papers and have another twenty-five to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Beginnings to the Norman Conquest . I also teach a playwriting course and have five honors ' tutorial students , along with four more I could n't say no to , in independent studies . I get presents for all my girl students in this Supply Store , and for the boys , too . They have wonderful old things . Buttons . Picture postcards . You can get the weirdest things in there . I found a postcard that reminded me of Krazy Kat ' humor . It showed a boy and a dog . The boy is saying , ' If you laugh and smile all the while , How will the streetcar fare , ' and the dog is saying , Bite him , Fido . He 's got no suspenders. ' 1 like it especially because a streetcar figures in the new play . Wait till you see our set . Our set designer made us a real streetcar that goes on a real track all around the stage . Be careful ! " Mr. Alfred held us back , out of the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , ' They 'll kill you ; it 's on their way , ' " he said , giving his all-out laugh . At Third and Seventy-sixth , Mr. Alfred said , " And here 's where the Third Avenue L ' station was . Where this pizza parlor is , there used to be a cigar store , where my parents got cigar coupons for me . I never knew how to save money , so I collected cigar coupons instead . I got a dime allowance . I tried to save it , because they told me you were supposed to save . Not much success . I 've never been good with money . " Mr. Alfred stopped suddenly and looked north on Third Avenue . " I was going to say , ' Let 's go to Rappaport 's Toy Bazaar , ' but I just remembered it folded last year , after being- in business for ninety years . I always think of their celluloid saxophone . It smelled of celluloid and nail polish . You turned the crank , and it played ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Jean Baptiste . " There 's been a white dove trapped in this church for several days , " Mr. Alfred said , looking around as we sat down in a pew at the rear . No dove to be seen . On the dome in the center of the transept : " CHRISTUM REGEIVI ADOREMUS DOMINANTEM GENTIBUS . " On the clerestory of the Baroque church , stained-glass windows illustrating the Old Testament : the sacrifice of Isaac ; Abraham offering tithes to Melchizedek ; Cain and Abel ; God talking to Adam and Eve after the FalL Within the dome : the Twelve Apostles . More stained-glass windows below : scenes of the Eucharist , including the feeding of the multitude ( the miracle of the loaves and fishes ) . Around the church : the fourteen Stations of the Cross . Several confessionals . Up front : the altar . To both sides of it : the devotional candles . " My father used to light candles to the Infant Jesus of Prague when he wanted to win the lottery , " Mr. Alfred whispered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were half a dozen other people in the church . Two of them were men , sound asleep . A third man had a loud , body-shattering cough . The others were elderly women . " Every Friday , all of us from St. Ann 's Academy would have Benediction , " Mr. Alfred said . " A priest would give the sermon . The following Friday , he 'd come back and you 'd be asked how much you remembered of the sermon . If you remembered enough , you 'd win a holy picture . I 'd win maybe once every three weeks . I was a great woolgatherer . Instead of listening to the sermon , I 'd be thinking of what we were going to have for supper . Look ! There 's the white dove ! Is n't that amazing ? " Nobody else in the church seemed to notice the dove , which was sitting on the altar . " When I reached seven  --  the age of reason  --  I made my First Communion here , " Mr. Alfred said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a bow of white silk on your sleeve . You wore short black pants , high black shoes , and black lisle stockings held up with a rubber band , which would always break , and then your stockings would get sucked down into your shoes in a lump . Two days after the First Communion , I was confirmed  --  that was done here at that age . Cardinal Hayes came . I 'd never seen anything that magnificent . His embroidered white-and-gold gloves ! His white-and-gold cope , and his gold mitre ! An enormous ermine cloak covered the pillars . It was so opulent , like something out of old history books . And Cardinal Hayes gave you a light slap on the face  --  to show that you must suffer for your faith . " On our way out , we looked at an empty glass case . " It used to hold a relic of St. Ann , " Mr. Alfred said . " It was supposed to be her thumb bone . It was wrapped in linen , with Latin writing all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You kissed the glass  --  you wiped it before and after you kissed it . Before , in case the person ahead of you had a cold and forgot to wipe it . " In the vestibule , we stopped to read a brass plaque : " IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF THOMAS FORTUNE RYAN , DONOR OF THIS CHURCH . TO HIS PRINCELY GENEROSI1Y , PRI:7101 , TM ) BY A LIVING FAITH , THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY INDEBTED . OF YOUR CHARITY PRAY THAT HIS SOUL MAY ENJOY FOR EVER , REFRESHMENT , LIGHT AND PEACE . DIED NoVENIBIER 23 , 1925 . R.I.P . " " I was probably around here on the day of the funeral , " Mr. Alfred said . A small elderly woman wearing about three coats against the cold came over to us in the vestibule and asked Mr. Alfred for the time . He said it was a quarter to three . She told him that she had to wait for a friend who was coming from her job at the Lenox Hill Hospital , and she started away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you another thing about that suit . You 'll get a lot of wear out of it . " Mr. Alfred said , picking it up and going after her . " Bless you . You 're very kind , " the woman said . " It 's warmer if you go inside the church , " Mr. Alfred said . III . THL THEATRF UTSIDE , on the steps of the church , Mr. Alfred pulled his hat down closer to his ears and stood for a moment , blinking at D'Agostino 's , on the other side of Lexington Avenue . We walked over with him to 170 East Seventy-seventh Street . " This is where the school 's soccer yard was , " he told us . " I was pretty good at soccer , because I had big feet . I was always fouling people with my feet . Arid here , next to it , was the dormitory where I slept . It was just like the one in the movie ' Zero de Conduite . ' Rows of beds up and down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one friend ? . Maurice , who was three months older than I was . He was very sweet to me . He had a pen  --  you looked through it and you saw the Tour Eiffel . And Brother John was a lovely man . He knew instinctively about children . He knew when you were blue . But he did n't condescend to you . A very grave , very sweet man . A year in that place , though , seemed like a century . I hated it . About thirty years ago , when the school was still here , I came to see it . All the Brothers I knew were gone . I had been having nightmares that I was still at St. Ann 's . I felt I might lay the dreams to rest . I do n't know when they tore the place down . Well , I 'd better be bringing the props to the theatre , " he said , pulling his hat down farther , against a sharp wind . " I do n't like to miss the rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my , they break your heart . They make me cry . Every time . They 're afraid for me on opening night . They want to put a paper bag over my head . " We got into a taxi and headed down to West Forty-fourth Street . " Wait till you see our theatre , " he said . " It 's the Little Theatre . Built in 1912 by Winthrop Ames , one of Guthrie McClintic 's first employers . It held two hundred and ninety-nine people in those days . Now it 's got a balcony and holds four hundred and ninety-nine . It has a beautiful Georgian front . And it 's right next door to Sardi 's . Four stories high . Winthrop Ames used to have his offices over the theatre . A very dignified-looking man . McClintic used to say that Ames looked like a Velazquez cardinal . Ames went to Harvard . Class of 1895 . I looked him up , because his initials , W.A. , interested me , if you do n't mind my getting loopy again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A spectacular-looking multilevel set  --  a revolving sculpture of a latticework of pipes suggesting a fire-escape landscape  --  had a realistic streetcar on a track . The set designer was conferring with the director . The lighting man was testing his set of color cards against the stage . The actors were walking around the stage , across the stage , onto the stage , off the stage . Mr. Alfred told us that the production cost three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars , and that five main producers and fifty independent investors had put up the money . " Nothing from me , " Mr. Alfred said . " Not since my ten-cents-a-week allowance have I held on to money . Watch , now . What you 're looking at up there is Bond Street and Third in South Brooklyn , in back of a disused brewery . The audience is the Gowanus Canal . Watch . " The streetcar onstage began to move on its track . Mr. Alfred looked as though lie needed to have a paper bag put over his head .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
