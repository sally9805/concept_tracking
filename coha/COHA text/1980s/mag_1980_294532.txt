Critics decry the P.M. ' s plans <P> Some of the voters who put Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives into office last May may well be wondering just who is in charge at 10 Downing Street , Mrs. Thatcher or Nobel-prizewinning U.S. Economist Milton Friedman . Friedman 's philosophy of monetarism-unflinching regulation of a nation 's money supply as the golden elixir for economic health-flows through every line of the Thatcher government 's budget for 1980 . The proposed budget , which is virtually assured of passage , was presented last week to a grim session of the House of Commons by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe , and the reactions it produced ranged from apprehension to bitterness . <P> To fight inflation , now at 19% , the plan called for deep cuts in public spending-over the next four years , $20 billion less than the last Labor budget . Foreign aid , education , housing and municipal programs of all kinds were slashed . No sector of the British economy was untouched . To raise revenues , North Sea oil taxes were hiked 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gushing into the treasury 's coffers as high-grade crude comes fully onstream . Alas for the ordinary Briton , new excise taxes raised the price of his beloved beer ( to 95 a pint from 91 ) as well as those of wine , whisky , cigarettes , automobiles and gasoline , which costs $2.42 per gal. , up from $2.25 . <P> Ironically , those excise tax hikes will have the effect of initially raising inflation to at least 20% . But Thatcher expects her people to support her in the effort to turn the economic indicators around . " We did not promise you instant sunshine , " she told a Tory group . " We pointed out over and over again that a nation can not accelerate downhill for years , then jam on the brakes and suddenly return to prosperity as though the past had never happened . " <P> The budget clearly showed the direction of the Tory government : for the first time since the inception of the British welfare state after World War II , a wide range of social benefits were " de-indexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescription drug prices for many Britons were more than doubled . Sick pay and unemployment compensation were declared taxable income . <P> The cuts leave Britons with precious little extra change in their pockets . Tinkering with income taxes-raising certain thresholds and allowances-will save some administrative costs and put only one or two additional pounds into the hands of the average family of four . That is not likely to impress most people , who flocked to pubs last week to drink up before the new taxes went into effect , and laid in cases of Scotch and gin to beat the $1.10 increase on each bottle . <P> Laborites fumed . Chief among them was former Prime Minister James Callaghan , who called the budget " the meanest the country has had since 1931 . " Surveying the new excise taxes , David Basnett , general secretary of the General and Municipal Workers Union , snapped : " Workers who live in a cave-if they do n't smoke , if they do n't drink , and if they drive an electric car-might say they were coming out better .
