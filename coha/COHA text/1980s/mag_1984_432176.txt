 | Let 's peek in on Cher , or more precisely chez Cher , as her $6.4 million Beverly Hills mansion appears on " Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous , " TV 's hottest new syndicated program . Visiting the 13-bedroom , Egyptian-style palace , we encounter a swimming pool watched over by a stone sphinx . We see a gymnasium with enough exercise equipment to accommodate a professional football team . We pass through endless chambers reserved for Cher 's gowns , Cher 's racks of color-coordinated lingerie and Cher 's several hundred pairs of shoes . " She never wears a single pair long enough for any of them to need repair , " gushes the program 's narrator . Finally we arrive at Cher 's black-and-gold boudoir , where a small pyramid rises from the floor . " Tutankhamen with a dash of Noel Coward , " muses our tour director , who concludes : " Her home is an original statement of good taste . " A questionable proposition , perhaps , but there 's certainly something original about this particular examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " confines itself to salivations over her queenly possessions . For whatever sociological reasons ? pick the pop-cultural guru of your choice ? the ebb and flow of the lumpen 's fascination with the rich has hit a historic high . And the upshot , in a medium that feeds itself on our fantasies of the moment , has been an outbreak of series about the superwealthy that promises to reach epidemic levels by next fall . Prepare yourself for shamelessly worshipful celebrations of hedonism , materialism , exhibitionism and voyeurism ? in other words , thoroughly irresistible television . The genre 's glossiest exhibit is the aforementioned " Lifestyles , " which began as a pair of two-hour specials and will start airing as a nationally syndicated weekly series on March 30 . Modestly billed as " an open ticket to the 22-karat core of success , " the show hops from the French Riviera to California 's Glitz Coast in search of Xanadus where " fortune is the final frontier . " Producer-host Robin Leach , a former reporter for " Entertainment Tonight , " is nothing if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else unearthing the fact that Britain 's Princess Diana spends $300,000 a year on clothing , " much of it on hats . " Or that ex-Beatle George Harrison owns an opulent oaken toilet that plays " Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds " when the seat is lifted . Or that game-show mogul Mark Goodson regularly airmails all of his dirty clothing from his Beverly Hills apartment to a favor- ite laundress in New York . Or that Loretta Lynn 's 5,000-acre ranch in Tennessee houses a pantry stocked with a 365-day foot supply . " Just in case the good times stol rolling , " explains Loretta to Robin . " Lifestyles ' " three competitors prefer to focus on the extravagant playthings of the privileged ? and the more outrageous the price tag , the more blatant the free commercial plug . Thus " The Good Life , " a falltargeted series described by its promoters a ' " the most luxurious half hour on television , " devotes a hefty chunk of its pilot show to touting the wonders of Aston Martin 's $150,000 Lagonda . Equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering whose title is drawn from an upscale specialty magazine originally distributed to owners of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys . The pilot for this series takes us to Paris 's Buccellati jewelers , where we are permitted to inspect a solid gold trinket case retailing for $300,000 . Virtually all such explorations of the upper crust feature mansions-on-the-block segments that look like video equivalents of a realtor 's publicity kit . The $11.5 million listing for a sevenacre spread displayed on ABC 's " Eye on Hollywood " seems inordinately stiff ? until we are informed that it was once ownedly Bill Cosby . Given the awesome amount of glitter such series consume , it is not inconceivable that they may eventually run out of bona fide . top-of-the-line material . Even the celebrityobsessed " Lifestyles " has already been obliged to make some concessions : a few segments in a recent special edition showcased those who had become rich and famous only by serving the already rich and famous . The most memorable example : Hollywood divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson , who proudly showed off an office suite containing stained-glass doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon and Josephine and a recliner from the estate of Rudolpll Valentino . Zingers : The inquisitorial styles displayed by the genre 's show hosts set new standards for broadcast journalism . Not for Robin Leach to lob the fawning puffballs of , say , a Mery Griffin . No , Leach goes straight for the jugular with such burning zingers as " Liberace , are you a gentle man living in a crazy world ? " The obsequious Leach , however , comes across as a regular Mike Wallace next to Ann Turkel , one of the guides to " The Good Life . " No contestant on " Let 's Make a Deal " ever hyperventilated over the goodies quite as feverishly as Ms. Turkel . After eyeing the $150,000 Lagonda , she clapped her hands and squealed , " I want that car so badly , " as cohost Randy Hamilton struggled to adopt an expression of brotherly sympathy . The people behind " The Good Life " have come up with an intriguing explanation for the appeal of syndicated Sybaritism : it 's essentially the networks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas , " " Dynasty " and " Falcon Crest , " they @#  | propose , has created a whole new television audience that longs to live vicariously through the plush existences of the rich . Robin Leach heartily agrees . " My show is Dallas ' brought to life , " he says . Certainly that theory is no more unreasonable than the one offered by " Eye on Hollywood " executive producer Craig Haffner . " In a difficult economic climate , " says Haffner , " there is always a tendency for people to do a little dreaming and a little escaping . " Though Leach and Haffner probably would never admit it , there could also be a more basic ? and baser ? instinct at work . Whether in good times or bad , few emotions invigorate the human spirit quite as satisfactorily as a secret surge of rank , undistilled envy . Imagine : Examined from a more positive perspective , television 's celebrations of excess may well turn out to be a wondrous motivational force . Hearing Jill St. John casually discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,000 mirror-tiled shower , watching Bob Guccione show off the solid gold crown in the mouth of his pet Rhodesian Ridgeback , is to sense the possibility that we could be them ? were we only to pull up our socks , get down to work and shut out all fancy notions about good taste . A wise man once proposed that " the final test of fame is to have a crazy person imagine he is you . " The Robin Leaches of TV may not be especially wise , but they are shrewd enough to recognize that great wealth can have the same effect . Might that be you and I , noses pressed against the 19-inch picture window , crazily imagining how to become Jill or Rod or Cher or Mark ? It just might be .
