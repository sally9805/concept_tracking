Last spring Beverly Hills Hairdresser Umberto Savone noticed that the hair-raising price of a wash , cut and blow-dry ( $35 ) was driving clients away from his fashionable Wilshire Boulevard shop . To lure them back , Savone unveiled the " mini-serve . " For a trimmed-down price of $15 , cash-conscious customers can get their locks soaped , clipped and conditioned . The blow-dry , though , is strictly do-it-yourself . Savone provides the equipment , but the client does the work . " Shops and real estate businesses have been closing in Beverly Hills , and our clients could no longer afford our regular prices , " says Savone . " This way the customer saves money , and we can do more heads in the same amount of time . " <P> The service has proved to be a hit with people who want a high-fashion look without the high price , and business is up 30% . " I like the mini-service a lot better , " says Janette Fennell , 24 , a secretary for a Beverly Hills law firm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never do it right . It 's a lot cheaper , and I do it better myself . " <P> Savone plans to take the self-service business a step further by opening a string of franchised salons to be called Hair Mechanico . He proudly proclaims that the new shops will resemble car washes . Says he : " People can have their hair Simonized have it washed and remove the rust get it cut and have their coils adjusted have a perm . They 'll pay only for labor and parts . " The salons are scheduled to open during the next four months in posh parts of Los Angeles , including Beverly Hills .
