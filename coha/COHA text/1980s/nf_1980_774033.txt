txt // called freeze branding has been developed . This method uses a super-cooled iron rather than a hot one . However , it may not be legal in all states , and not all ranchers approve of this method  --  partly because it is quite involved and partly because they do not like the resulting brand . The freezing destroys the melanocytes ( pigmentproducing cells ) . This causes the hair and the skin to turn white . Even white animals can be branded with this method as there is enough pigment in the skin of white animals to result in a white brand free of hair . Simply overbrand the white animal by leaving the iron on the skin longer than the required 30 seconds for other animals . Overbranding destroys the hair follicles . The freeze-brand method has several advantages over the hot-iron method : 1 . The brand is visible the year around without the hair having to be clipped . Freezing turns the hair white and removes the pigment from the skin . 2 . The method is relatively painless to the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concern for the health and safety of animals . 3 . The method does not result in a thick scar which reduces the value of the hide as the hot-iron method does . 4 . The brand does not blotch . The procedure found to be most practical to date is as follows : 1 . Clip the hair from the area to be branded . The closer it is clipped the better . 2 . Dampen the area with alcohol to give better contact with the iron and to keep the iron from freezing to the hide . 3 . Cool the iron by placing it in a solution of dry ice // ( solid carbon dioxide ) and alcohol ( ethyl , methyl , or isopropyl ) . A styrofoam box ( 12 x 20 x 10 inches deep ) is satisfactory as an insulated container . Do not use a plastic-lined box as thin plastic will crack . Break dry ice into egg-sized pieces to cover the bottom of the box .

Leave the iron in the solution until heavy bubbling ( or boiling ) stops . For quantity branding , it is desirable to have a large enough container to be able to place all of the irons being used in the solution at once . 4 . Press the iron against the animal 's skin for 30 seconds . A heavy copper or bronze branding iron ( ) A ; inch wide and at least 1 inch deep ) has been proven to be best . If a smaller iron or an iron made of steel or iron ( metals that will not replace the heat as quickly ) is used , the branding will take longer . Also , a round-faced iron has been proven to be more efficient because it results in a more even contact with the skin .

Tattoo or Tag Calves in Purebred Herds  --  Most registry associations require tattoo identification on the inside of the ear , which is one of the most permanent means of identification . With breeds having pigmented skins , such as the Aberdeen-Angus , tattoo marks are // difficult to read . Neck chains with numbers are used with Polled breeds . Ear tags are also used , but are sometimes torn out unless carefully inserted . In tattoo ing , the ear should be well-cleaned in the area where the mark is to be put and only permanent type tattoo ink used . The American Polled Hereford Association gives the following tips for good tattooing . Wipe both ears clean . Place tattoo between ribs of the ear . After ear is pierced , rub tattoo ink into the punctures with thumb or finger , using plenty of ink . Be sure the number in your herdbook corresponds with the numbers and letters in the ears . In average herds , it is best to start with number 1 in each ear and proceed upward in regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In working range cattle or large purebred herds , it is difficult to accurately determine which calf belongs to what dam . Separate cows and calves for two or three hours until the calves are hungry ; then let one or two calves into the bunch of cows and they will quickly find their mothers . Try the following approved practice . Glue on Numbered Tags to " Pair Up " Even though calves and their dams may be ear tattooed , it is difficult to pair them up in order to record the identification in the record book or to apply for registration papers . An easy system is to duplicate numbered tags and glue them on the animals , one on the dam and one on the calf . Once they have been paired up and the data noted , the tattoo number can // // be found and proper I.D . made . If the dam is already legibly tagged or identified , only the calf need have a number glued on . Excellent glue for this purpose is available at any livestock supply house . Tail Bobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simply snip off the switch ( below base of tail ) with a knife or ; shears . Sick cows , cows in heat , culled // animals and so on can be identified from the rest of the herd by this procedure . 6 . Reading Brands* The use of brands as a mark of identification dates back some 4,000 years . Inscriptions and picture writing on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs indicate that cattle were branded as early as 2000 B.C. History also shows that use of the branding iron has not always been restricted to the hides of livestock . Slaves , fugitives and criminals were often stamped for life with the indelible mark of the brand . The practice of branding human beings was followed in England until as late as 1822 . The American custom of cattle branding was adopted // from Mexico . The Mexican Dons marked their huge herds with their family coat-of-arms and , as the cattle industry moved northward into Texas , this method of indicating ownership gradually became accepted by American ranchers . Today there are hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rancher decides upon the type of brand he wants to use , the legal procedure is to register his mark . State laws designate a brand inspector or similar official who is responsible for assigning and recording brands . In some states registration must be made with the county clerk in each county or counties where the rancher expects to operate . This makes it possible for men in different parts of the country to use the same brand , although the reading of the brand may differ from one locality to another . Read from Left to Right Brands are read from left to right , from the top down , or from outside inside . A definite method of identifying characters has been established . If a letter or symbol is made backwards from its normal position , it 's read as a reverse F , or whatever other letter it might be . A letter partially over on its face or back is said to be " tumbling . " t If a letter lies horizontally on its face or back , it is called " lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top and rounded angles are called " running . " . /j/ ' Adding a dash to the left and one to the right at the top , you have a " flying " letter . V Add legs and it becomes a " walking " letter . A letter placed so that the bottom touches the inside of a curve is said to be " rocking . " . L In this particular instance the brand would probably be called the " anchor . " Curves not attached to letters are known as " quarter circles " or " half circles , " depending on the arc . Letters or symbols formed together are called " connected " // Ff , except when one is below the other ; then the lower symbol is said to be " swinging . " In registering brands , owners sometimes omit the " connected " or " swinging . " Thus , might be read simply Diamond J rather than Diamond Swinging J. Memorize Character Brands Besides the traditional letter and figure brands , there are some marks known as " character brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turtle brand . A few other commonly used picture brands are : the pitchfork + ' , the rocking chair . b- , the key 14  --  G , the spade a  --  a , the ladder 4 ' ' , and the signpost ' . The reading of picture brands depends upon the own er 's interpretation , and it takes an expert to identify some of the complex marks . Try Angle Brands ARS veterinary scientist R. Keith Farrell , Pullman , Washington , designed a system based on angles which // // is unalterable and easily read from a distance . ( See Figure 4.16 . ) The system is based on two concentric squares . In the basic square , numbering starts in the upper left corner with two , and continues clockwise with four , six , and eight . The odd numbers are obtained by ro tating the basic square an eighth turn to the right so the corners fill in the gaps between the even numbers . Numbering begins at the top with three and runs clock-wise in five , seven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal parallel lines for one and zero , respectively , are used to form symbols . Position of the angles relaPRODUCTION // tive to the concentric squares indicates how the sym bols are read . Animals were marked with this system by tattoo , freeze brand , and laser . In recognition trials , the angles were more easily read than numbers , even though people are familiar with numbers . For example , at 40 feet only 59 per cent // of the numbers were recognized , compared with 90 percent of the angle symbols . 7 . Creep Feeding Calves Creep Feeding Desirable  --  In this practice , young calves are allowed access to extra feed while they are still nursing . Plans for constructing creep feeders are found in the chapter on Beef Equipment . This practice enables calves to do well even though their dams are poor milkers , and indirectly helps the cow when feed conditions are unfavorable because the calves draw less heavily upon their mothers . Generally , calves begin to eat grain at four to five weeks of age . Provide suitable rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 recommends the following ra tions : Well-bred calves when properly creep fed attain a weight of 700 to 800 pounds and desirable market finish at ten to twelve months of age . Creep Feeders Admit Calves Only  --  Calves can enter creep feeders  --  without interference from full-grown // cattle  --  to get grain as soon as they will take it . Adapt basic idea to local needs . Creep Feeding Not Adaptable to Rough Areas  --  In order to be practical , creep feeding must be used where the herd comes regularly to a central point for water , salt , or shade . On rough , hilly areas or where cattle graze over vast areas , the method is generally im practical . 8 . Providing Proper Minerals Minerals Essential  --  Minerals are necessary for the health of animals and even for life itself . The amount and kind of minerals will depend to a large extent on the kind of ration the animals are receiving and the area on which they are grazing . It is just as important to avoid the extra expense and trouble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are necessary . Provide Salt " Free-Choice "  --  Salt is the mineral // most needed by beef cattle and " free-choice " is the logical way of feeding it . Beef breeding cows , especially when nursing calves , eat more salt than fattening steers . When cattle are on pasture , especially on succulent pasture , early summer pasture , which is rich in potassium , they consume more salt . Therefore , special care should be exercised to provide plenty of salt at these times . Many livestock men prefer half-ground rock salt . Table Provide Ample Calcium and Phosphorus  --  Requirments of calcium and phosphorus will be met by most otherwise well-balanced rations . Rations with heavy concentrate and minimum amounts of non-legume hay will need a calcium supplement . Ground limestone or ground oyster shell is a good source of calcium . Rations consisting of alfalfa hay , molasses , and beet pulp with little or no grain will need phosphorus supplements . Steamed bone meal is a good source of phophorus . These minerals may be fed free-choice , mixed with salt or combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // smaller amounts of other important minerals must be included in the diet if proper growth is to be made . In some areas , like those in Northern California or in the Midwest , iodine may be lacking in the drinking water . If such is the case , it may cause goiters in cattle , and calves will be born weak or dead . Iodine is best supplied by frequently mixing fresh potassium iodide with ground rock salt . Some areas , like those in Florida , may lack cobalt or other trace elements that are necessary for the life and health of beef animals . Local inquiry to the state extension service or U.S.D.A. should be made concerning trace elements and how to supply them , as no advantage is gained in adding these minerals if they are unnecessary . 9 . Properly Handling the Calves This is especially important in a registered herd where animals are raised for show and for sale as individual breeding animals . Practice " Gentling " the Calves  --  Be quiet around your calves and get them gentle by scratching or rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle them . Practice Training the Calves  --  Teach the calf at an early age to stand and lead . Halter breaking , brushing , and clipping go hand in hand with feeding . Buyers are always impressed by a well-trained animal . Of course , this practice is unnecessary in commercial herds where all individuals will be sold as feeder or fat cattle . Properly Train Horns  --  On horned breeds , the appearance of the animal is improved if the horns are trained to grow downward and slightly forward in a gentle curve . Training should be done with light weights // when the horns are small or about 4 to 6 inches , but solidly attached to the skull . One-half pound weights are about right with which to start . Care should be used so that too sharp a downward bend is not made . Separate the Males from the Females  --  Bull calves should be separated from the heifers at about six months of age . In commercial herds , separation is un necessary although many producers find it a desirable practice to separate steers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped feet affect the apPRODUCTION // pearance and sale value and the way an animal walks . Trimming the feet will be necessary as the toes begin to grow . The most satisfactory way is to utilize a nip-per , wood chisel , and wood rasp while the animal is securely held in foot trimming stocks . This operation is rarely necessary when cattle are on the range . If only a small amount of trimming is necessary or perhaps only one foot is to be trimmed , it can be done easily , using longhandled pruning shears , while the // animal is standing on the ground . In order to do so , place the animal in a chute or alley so it can not turn around , or else halter and tie it . While the animal is standing , any unwanted long horny growth can be clipped off . However , if extensive trimming is needed , then the animal must be restrained enough so the hoof can be cleaned , trimmed , and rasped level . See Fig. 4.19 which shows how the hoof is secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feet of Mature Cattle Regularly  --  This is especially critical with old cattle and on irrigated pas tures or during the winter on wet ground . Range cattle on rough ground generally wear off the hooves rapidly enough so that little trimming is necessary . However , older cattle and very gentle or inactive cattle frequent ly need to have their feet trimmed . // Provide Exercise and Sunshine  --  Sunshine provides Vitamin D. Calves should not be kept in a barn continually . Provide an exercise lot or grass pasture . Check Snow Burn  --  Glare or snow-reflected sunshine in range country can blind whiteface calves or blister light colored teats and udders of nursing cows . To prevent eye trouble paint or stamp a strip about one inch wide under each eye using nyanzol dye . Wyoming County agent , Nels Dahiquist recommends preparing the compound by mixing a measured quantity of powdered nyanzol in boiling water . Dissolve an equal amount of gum arabic ( acacia gum ) in cold water , mix the two together and place in a tight container . Before using , add half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will crystallize . The stain lasts as long as the hair lasts on a calf . // 10 . Dehorning and Castrating Calves According to Farmer 's Bulletin 1600 , U.S.D.A. , the following are desirable practices : Dehorning , castrating , branding , marking , and vaccinating may be performed most satisfactorily and with greatest speed when a well-constructed chute is provided for holding the animal . Plans for this equipment are included in Chapter VI or in the Handbook of Livestock Equipment , published by The Interstate Printers &; Publishers , Inc. , Danville , Illinois . A. Castration Properly Castrate Calves  --  Castration improves the beef animal from a beef standpoint causing greater development of the regions from which valuable cuts are taken . Castration also assists in management of the herd . One method is to grasp the scrotum , stretch it out tightly and cut off the lower one-third of the sac . One testicle should be removed at a time . To accomplish this , press the testicle out of the scrotum and cut it off allowing three or four inches of cord to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a knife . Castration should not be performed by an inexperienced person . Using the Bloodless Method  --  This calls for a special pinch or clamps which crush each cord separately an inch or two above the testicle . Use the Elastrator  --  The younger the calf the better . Best results are obtained on calves from a few days old to a month old . At this age the skin is soft and the testicles will drop off more quickly . However , the Elastrator may be used on calves three or four months of age , if desired . The older the calf , the more the ring must be // stretched and the longer it takes the purse to drop off . Follow the manufacturer 's directions for applying the ring to the scrotum . Be certain both testicles are down and through the ring before releasing . Bloodless methods are desirable if there is danger of screwworm infestation . Protect Against Tetanus  --  If the elastrator band is not put on properly or the testicles are too large , as on older calves , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal , so every precaution should be // taken to guard against its happening . Tetanus results from a deep wound where there is no oxygen , so conditions are set up where the germ can develop . Therefore , at the slightest indication of trouble , such as lack of quick healing , a deep wound , or swollen testicles , the calves should be immediately vaccinated for tetanus . Very valuable calves should be vaccinated for tetanus along with the castration operation . Treatment with antitoxin after the animals get tetanus is impractical and seldom successful . Consult a veterinarian if there is any question on procedure . Select the Proper Time  --  Bull calves may be castrated from a few weeks up to four months of age . They should be castrated before they are weaned and generally as young as possible if consistent with herd management . Cool weather is desirable to prevent fly strike , but the operation should not be done in severe weather . Prevent Fly Strike  --  Fly strike or screwworm infestation should be guarded against . Pine tar oil smeared on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered at present most effective . Spaying Heifers Not a Desirable Practice  --  Spaying is the removal of ovaries in females . Veterinarians are employed to do the work . The added expense and risk seldom justify the operation . B. Dehorning Horned feeder cattle require more space at the feed trough . Dehorned cattle produce carcasses with fewer bruises and better quality hides than horned cattle handled under the same conditions . Dehorn at Proper Age  --  The younger cattle are when // they are dehorned , the better beef animals they will make . Dehorn during cool weather , if possible , to avoid fly strike danger . Use Proper Method of Dehorning  --  If calves are from three to ten days of age , the best method is the application of caustic ( or any commercial dehorning paste ) to the horn " buttons " so as to prevent growth . The hair should be clipped away from the button and the area rubbed well with the caustic stick . Petroleum jelly can be applied to the surrounding area so as to // prevent skin burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days . Range producers often have a herd rider constantly with the cattle , who dehorn all calves a few days after they are born . Saws or mechanical dehorners are used to dehorn mature cattle . If saws are used , the cut should be made from the bottom of the horn upwards , and cutting toward the top or poll of the animal 's head . A " squeeze " that securely holds the animal 's head is almost exclusively used to hold the animals . This device is illustrated in the section on beef equipment . Prevent Excessive Bleeding  --  On mature animals , profuse bleeding may take place . Apparently considerable bleeding can take place with little or no damage . // Excessive bleeding can be stopped with tannic acid or commercial clotting powders . 11 . Properly Vaccinating Calves Death losses can be minimized by proper immunization against disease . Prevention of diseases is most satisfactory by vaccination when carried on as part of the program of raising and producing calves and feeders . Select the Proper Age  --  Depending on the disease , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be vaccinated as young as possible and before they go // on summer range . It is well to do any such operation before weaning . Vaccinate Against Blackleg  --  Blackleg immunization is almost a universal practice . Protection through immunization should be done as early as possible in accordance with directions supplied by manufacturer of vaccine . Guard Against Anthrax  --  In anthrax-infected areas , routine vaccination is necessary . Veterinary service should be employed immediately in all anthrax outbreaks . See chapter on disease . Vaccinate Heifers for Bang 's Disease  --  Bang 's disease is not as great a problem in beef cattle as with dairy herds . However , most progressive breeders follow a definite pattern of control . Heifers should be vaccinated with an approved vaccine at six to eight months of age . This should accompany a regular program of blood testing the herd . Some states now have a system of calfhood vaccination similar to the T.B . control program . Sometimes this is without cost to the beef producer . Cooperate with T.B . Inspection Program  --  Federal inspection and control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watchfulness should be practiced. 12 . Providing Satisfactory Pastures Good Pasture Essential  --  Pasture , either irrigated or not , provides the key to economical beef production . Rarely is a profit made with farm beef cattle without pasture supplying the bulk of the feed until cattle reach the feed Iot . Irrigated pastures under good management provide : a . Conservation and improvement of soil resources . // b . Cheaper , more nutritious feed for livestock . c . Low harvest costs because livestock harvest their own feed . d . Some saving in protein feed supplements . e . Better gains in young stock . f . Higher production in a breeding herd . g . More economical gains in market animals . h . A farm labor load more evenly distributed over the year . Unirrigated native pastures have many of these same advantages . Cattle raised on adequate pastures seldom have as serious a disease or parasite problem as those raised in confinement . Therefore , approved practices on pastures should be followed . // Properly Utilize Pasture  --  A common saying is to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the number of head feeding on pasture should balance the available feed supply with some reserve so as not to damage the pasture . However , there is no advantage in keeping too few head on a given area , as the feed may grow too rank and coarse so that cattle dislike to eat it . Furthermore , grass that is not consumed one season generally is spoiled by rain , thereby becoming a loss to the producer . Do Not Overgraze Pastures  --  While it is important to utilize feed to the capacity of the pasture , much damage can result by overgrazing . Most cattlemen feel that they can prevent overgrazing by one of two methods . a . Rotation of pastures  --  Move cattle from field to field so as to utilize feed , but remove them before the pasture is damaged . This method requires adequate fencing of fields . b . Sensible continuous grazing  --  Leave cattle on the area continually , but regulate numbers ; place salt and water strategically and supply supplement when necessary so as to properly control grazing . Regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digging wells , or otherwise providing water , you can have the cattle graze over a larger area and utilize more feed than if they must congregate in one locality to drink . Salt and minerals , as well as protein supplements , can be properly distributed over the range so as to make the cattle graze evenly over the pasture . Proper distribution of these items will also prevent useless walking on the part of the cattle so that less feed will be required for maintenance . // Provide Proper Fencing  --  Proper fencing insures the proper use of pastures , lessens the amount of labor required , and prevents animals from injuring them-selves . Three- or four-strand barbed wire fences are adequate for control on the range , but for smaller areas near the farmstead , woven wire should be used . Fences around any areas into which the cattle are to be crowded or worked should be of heavy board construction . Adjust Cattle Numbers to Feed Supply  --  Following are some practical methods of adjusting to seasonal and annual variations in feed supply : Provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is essential when cattle are maintained on a single ranch unit as when winter feed and summer feed are supplied by separate units . Stock the ranges moderately so that ample for-age is available in average years for maximum gains , and excess forage waste through non-use is avoided . Build up a reserve of hay and other feeds in good years and in times of low prices to meet drought and other extreme conditions . Maintain some reserve of fat on breeding cattle so that weight losses can be withstood in an emergency without interfering with further production . 13 . Properly Weaning Calves Calves dropped early in the spring under favorable conditions will attain sufficient size and weight by summer or fall to be sold either as fat calves , stockers , or feeder calves , or they may be weaned when six to nine months old and kept within the herd . Early spring calves should never be permitted to follow their // mothers during the winter months . They may be kept quiet when weaned by placing them in a herd of dry cows . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purebred calves later . // In order to insure maximum growth , purebred calves nursing their mothers should not be weaned until eight to nine months old . b . Weaning creep-fed calves is a simple matter . This is true because the calves are advanced enough in their feeding period so that they do not miss their mothers . Furthermore , if the same creep-fed ration is continued , calves experience little set-back from wean ing. // 14 . Producing Feeder Cattle Feeder Cattle Essential  --  With the exception of purebred breeders who are producing registered cattle for breeding stock only , a great bulk of the cattle raisers are producing primarily feeder cattle . Strictly speaking , feeder cattle are cattle almost mature and in good enough flesh to be economically fed to fatten for slaughter . Several fundamental rules should be followed if feeds are to be marketed most efficiently through the production of feeder cattle . a . Adopt a consistent , systematic breeding and culling program as has been outlined in previous chapters . b . Secure through breeding , management , feeding , and disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through feeding and management normal and continuous growth of young cattle to secure efficient feed utilization and a desirable product . d . Adopt production and selling policies that will yield the highest return from the annual feed supply . This rule will be discussed in a later chapter . // Utilize the Principle of Continuous Growth  --  Cattle should have additional feeds supplemented in periods of poor grazing so that they will not lose the gain they have made under good feeding conditions . This is es pecially important in young animals as they generally make the most economical gains in weight . Much food is required for maintenance ; therefore , if cattle are kept growing continuously even throughout the winter months , the total amount of feed required per pound of beef will be less because they will reach a market-able age much sooner . Supplement Calves and Yearlings on the Range  --  A gain of about one pound per day for calves that will // be sold as feeders at the end of the next grass season is a sound objective . If steer calves are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11/4 to 1 pounds daily gain during the winter are desirable . One method of reaching this goal on dry range is to supplement 1 to 11/2 pounds daily of cottonseed cake or equivalent protein feeds . Hay must be supplied in addition in areas where dry winter forage is not available . Steer calves so fed should weigh 850 to 900 pounds at the end of the next grass season . Properly Winter Weaners and Yearlings on Harvested Roughages  --  No class of cattle responds more // profitably to liberal feeding than calves during their first winter . a . Provide sanitary mangers and feed bunks. b . Provide well-drained corrals and shelters against winds and storms . c . Utilize one of the following systems : ( 1 ) Supply all the high quality legume hay the calves will eat . Calves will eat 10 to 15 pounds daily depending on size . ( 2 ) Supply 3/4 to 1 pound daily of cottonseed cake or equivalent with low-protein or nonlegume hay . ( 3 ) Ten to 15 pounds of silage with all the legume hay the calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calves ea wintered should weigh 500-600 pounds in the spring , and 800-900 pounds at the end of the following pasture season. - Chapter V FEEDING BEEF CATTLE Feed Properly  --  Good feeding begins with proper management of the soil so it will produce maximum feed of good quality . The feeding of cattle for beef production affords one of the most practical ways of disposing of grain and roughages produced on the farm . Diversification in agriculture and well-balanced use of farm labor is made possible by this industry . Approximately 75 per cent of the fertilizing constituents of feeds fed to livestock is returned in the manure . The feed produced by the land and the cattle on it are most productive when well-balanced rations are fed . According to Farmer 's Bulletin 1549 , U.S.D.A. , ability in buying and selling cattle and in combining feeds properly has a direct bearing on success in beef cattle feeding . Consequently , there are many approved practices in beef feeding which should be followed . Activities Which Involve Approved Practices 1 . Selecting desirable roughages. 2 . Selecting desirable concentrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Providing sufficient water . 157 Preparing feed properly . Feeding the beef calf . Feeding the breeding herd . Feeding cattle for fattening . Feeding beef calves for show . Feeding and testing young bulls . Providing for economical use of labor . Providing comfort for animals . Protecting cattle from stock poisoning plants . 1 . Selecting Desirable Roughages Coarse , bulky feeds called roughages , which often-times go to waste , can be converted into profits by feeding to cattle . It is important that land most suited for producing roughages yield large quantities of high quality feeds . Provide Pastures  --  Good pastures are the founda tion of profitable beef production because they furnish the cheapest possible source of nutrients and cattle // harvest their own food . Properly managed , they will build soil fertility and help control erosion . In years of high-priced corn or other concentrates , pastures save feed and produce cheaper beef although rates of gain are slower on pasture than on full feed concentrates . Pastures fit in well with other crops in a rotation system . Many pastures benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be cultured to produce the greatest number of pounds of beef per acre per year . Pit Pastures Pitting shortgrass ranges will increase forage growth and allow more animals to be run per acre . The pits made with an eccentric disk kill a portion of the range plants but the remaining plants yield more feed because of trapped moisture . The process should be repeated every 8 to 10 years . Green Grass Best  --  Native pasture and grass produced on land too rough for extensive farming provide excellent feed during the grass-growing season . However , dry grass is lower in protein and supplemental protein feeds must be provided when dry grass is fed . Practice Conservative Stocking  --  More cattle than the land is capable of carrying should never be allowed . Reserved grazing for use in dry periods is a good safety practice to follow . Native ranges should always be allowed to set seed . This is especially true for annual grasses . However , once annual plants produce seed , there is no advantage in not letting cattle clean up all the remaining forage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of perennial grasses and legumes provide an
