Texas oil : President-elect George Bush . Texas oil : Secretary of State-designate James Baker 3d . Texas oil : Secretary of Commerce-designate Robert Mossbacher Sr. Texas oil : Speaker of the House Jim Wright . They have never had control like this , and their grip will be even tighter if Bush appoints yet another Texas businessman , John Tower , as his Secretary of Defense . One of the first things the Washington Oilers are likely to do is slap an import fee of about $7 a barrel on foreign oil , thereby automatically raising the price of domestic crude by that much , which will push it over the $20 level and make Texas as arrogantly rich as it was when its cars sported bumper stickers reading , " Freeze a Yankee . " For years , the pols from the oil states have been saying out loud that they want this tariff . That 's what Bush meant in 1986 , before his trip to the Middle East , when he said that the oil price slide should n't go unchecked . What now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California and oil exploration on Federal lands in Alaska and the lower forty-eight . Environmentalists have been putting up a strong fight , and George Bush says he is an environmentalist . But he was an oil man long before his campaign conversion to love of harbors . When Bush 's tennis-playing buddy Baker joined the Reagan Administration , his financial disclosure statement showed family holdings in Exxon , Mobil , Atlantic Richfield , Standard Oil of California , Standard Oil of Indiana and Kerr-McGee . Given these predilections , it would hardly be surprising if a Baker State Department reverted to the old days when international oil set foreign policy in the Middle East . The last time we had anything like such a concentration of oil men in Washington was during the Johnson Administration , but at least some of them ? including L.B.J. himself at times ? had some feeling for people , which resulted in the Great Society programs . Bush and his Texas friends are likely to tap a different reservoir . Bush Says ' Shush ' p resident-elect George Bush parades as a moderate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but . During the campaign , the former Director of Central Intelligence told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that " within the limits of national security , government should be open . " But , he cautioned , that does n't mean that " every staff member will be authorized to serve as an administrative spokesman or interpreter of events and policies . " Bush thus pledges to continue the closemouthed policies of the Reagan Administration , which even in its waning days is doing its bit to keep pesky government workers from speaking out . Last month , the President vetoed a bill that would have protected whistleblowers . And in the wake of a court ruling that the President has " sovereign " powers over national security information see Pell and Mackenzie , " Reagan Rex , " The Nation , July 2/9 , the Administration has reinstated a secrecy program aimed at silencing and censoring more than 2 million government workers and contractors . The President 's Information Security Oversight Office ( ISOO ) is circulating a revised agreement obligating Federal employees not to disclose classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement encourages prepublication review of all writings and allows for court orders to stop publication of allegedly classified information . Congress , afraid of being left in the dark by a secretive executive , last year voted to ban funds to implement the nondisclosure program , which began in 1983 . In response to the Congressional ban , ISOO suspended the program for several months . Seven members of Congress and three unions of Federal employees put further pressure on ISOOby filing a lawsuit claiming that the secrecy program interfered with employees ' right to free speech and with their right to communicate with Congress . Most counts in the suit were dismissed last May , but the Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal by the employees ' unions and members of Congress , who argue that the lower court 's opinion " completely ignored Congress 's constitutional role in national security and appropriations . " ISOO director Steven Garfinkel responded to the suit 's dismissal with a memorandum reinstituting the nondisclosure agreements and reinforcing the Administration 's view that Congress is not entitled to classified information . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to perform its legislative function " under what he called the " need-to-know " requirement . And who decides , under current law , what national security information it is necessary for Congress to know ? Why , the White House does , unless the Supreme Court reverses the current trend .

Food Junk he front cover of this month 's National Geographic is a hologram depicting the earth as a crystal globe that shatters when viewed from a cer- tain angle . The back cover , also a hologram , of-fers the golden arches of McDonald 's in an advertisement reminding readers that " none of us is as good as all of us . " This bromide from the late founder of McDonald 's , Ray Kroc , is meant to persuade us that the hamburger people are at one with the Geographic people , who have devoted the December issue to the question of whether humanity can " save this fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the striking covers ) is McDonald 's annual use of more than 70 million pounds of liquid polystyrene , the petroleum product used to make its styrofoam cups and containers . Brian Lipsett of the Citizen 's Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste says polystyrene is the fifth largest source of toxic waste produced in the United States . It is not biodegradable and can not be burned without releasing poisonous gases . If buried , it can leach chemicals into soil , water and ultimately the food chain , where it can be metabolized into carcinogens once inside the human body . Lipsett maintains that each year McDonald 's is responsible for 1.7 billion cubic feet of non-biodegradable styrofoam that can not be safely disposed of , and that the volume is growing steadily . For all its three-dimensional advertising , McDonald 's does not seem to feel that the earth , too , deserves a break today .
