I read with interest the article by Joan Frawley ( Sept. 25 ) on Ferraro and abortion . As a Republican I am not predisposed to side with Ms. Ferraro . However , after reading the article I felt that her actions were entirely compatible with her declaration that while personally opposed to abortion she does not believe in imposing her religious views on others . Her stand epitomizes the concept behind Voltaire ' s famous dictum : " I wholly disapprove of what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it . " The Catholic Church makes an assumption that its own moral values are universal . That is not always the case . On this basis religious denominations that do not share the Catholic view of abortion ( or divorce or birth control ) are immoral . Is the Lutheran Church immoral ? Are the 55 Catholic theologians who disagreed with the church heirarchy on the issue of abortion all immoral ? The pro-life group asserts that abortion is murder . Murder is a serious crime and warrants severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pose a question : Do they favor prosecuting for first degree murder , with sentences of life imprisonment or death , those million women a year who choose to have an abortion ? Shaw McCutcheon Spokane , Wash.  --  - I ' ve finally figured out the Mondale/Ferraro position on abortion , and you know , I like it . Now what I don ' t understand is why they stop there . Let ' s close down our police departments and send all our law enforcement personnel home  --  they only serve to impose one group ' s morality on another . After all , bank robbery is one of the most personal choices a man ( or woman ) ever makes . And why bother with toxic waste dumps ? Mondale says " they ' re killing our children , " but as Ferraro has so aptly pointed out , children are just a future drain on the welfare system  --  and anyway , women have better things to do than be " incubators for future taxpayers .

Bear Lake Grove , Ore.  --  - Euthanasia must be popular with Colorado Democrats . In her letter Sept. 18 , Rep. Patricia Schroeder states that " the new policy " ( opposition to abortion as an option for world population control ) " embraces coercion and central control by denying freedom of choice to women . " No doubt Ms. Schroeder feels the U.S. embraced coercion and central control when we denied " freedom of choice " to citizens wishing to own slaves . She probably also feels it is a reduction in freedom of choice that we bar most other forms of homicide . Governor Lamm was at least a little more straightforward about old people being in the way and absorbing too many resources . It would clarify the matter a great deal if people who believe euthanasia is a viable policy would just say so . But then people who dreamed up the euphemism " freedom of choice " aren ' t much for clarity  --  of language or thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
