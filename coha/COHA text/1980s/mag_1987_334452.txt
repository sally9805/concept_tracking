No commercials ! That has been one of the strongest selling points of movies on video-cassettes . But next week , when the long-awaited home-video version of the blockbuster Top Gun goes on sale , consumers will be surprised to find the movie preceded by a 60-second commercial for Diet Pepsi . The spot , which ( features a jet pilot pouring a soda while flying upside down , will be the first by a major advertiser to appear on a U.S. videocassette . <P> The ad is the result of a novel cross-promotion deal in which no money will change hands between Pepsi and Paramount , the film 's producer . To compensate the studio for putting the ad on the cassette , almost $2 million worth of the jet-jockey Diet Pepsi commercials on broadcast TV will carry a voice-over touting the Top Gun video . Because Paramount will get free advertising , it will charge only $26.95 for the cassette , about $3 less than the lowest price so far for a major release .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
