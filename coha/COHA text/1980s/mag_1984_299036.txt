What the Soviets really want is to get rid of Ronald Reagan <P> Part of the quarrel between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. is over the question of just how bad their relations are and whether they are likely to improve in the near future . One reason the Soviets announced their boycott of the Olympics last week was to buttress their argument that relations are very bad indeed . <P> To hear them tell it , the climate of relations is at its worst since the most frigid days of the cold war . Nor is the deterioration just a matter of degree , it is a quantum jump downward to a whole new level of nastiness . By Moscow 's estimate , the big chill is not merely disagreeable , it is dangerous : World War III , while not necessarily imminent , is more imaginable in the current atmosphere than before . Who do the Soviets blame for this alarming state of affairs ? Ronald Reagan , whom they have recently started comparing to Adolf Hitler . The Kremlin leaders and their spokesmen have concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan Administration . Soviet-American relations , they say , will remain terrible until the U.S. adopts a whole new set of policies under a new President . In the meantime , a thaw is impossible , the Soviets feel , because with someone like Reagan in the White House , the only heat that can be expected is the kind that is generated by constant friction . <P> The response to all this from Washington has been low-key and reassuring . While the Soviets wring their hands , pound their fists and wag their fingers , officials of the Reagan Administration shake their heads wearily but indulgently . Soviet-American relations are not all that bad , they say . Nor , the Administration implies , should they be all that good . The two nations are , after all , fundamentally and irreconcilably at odds over how their own societies-and indeed the planet itself-should be run . Dtente was , in that sense , unnatural . <P> According to the Administration , the Soviets are screaming because they feel the pinch of a tougher , more resolute American policy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Reagan 's gullible , accommodating predecessors ; they realize that they are up against a new American leadership that will cooperate with them only on its own terms , that will compete with them vigorously and that will penalize them for their misdeeds . For that reason , Washington maintains , the Soviets ' howls of protest , insofar as they are sincere , should be music to American and Western ears . <P> Moreover , continue the Administration and its supporters , there is more than a little stagecraft in the Soviet temper tantrum . Moscow is deliberately exaggerating the troubles afflicting East-West relations . Many West Europeans are nervous about Reagan 's hard line , and the Soviets are trying to exploit those anxieties so that Bonn , London and Paris will distance themselves politically from Washington .
