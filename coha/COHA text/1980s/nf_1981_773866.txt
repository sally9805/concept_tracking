txt // had lost its ability to destroy the viscera ? the liver , kidneys , heart , and other organs ? it had acquired on its travels through mouse brains a vicious affinity for the cells of the nervous system . Inoculated into the brains of monkeys , the tamed yellow fever virus produced fatal encephalitis . Thus , there was the danger that if it were given as a vaccine , it might infect the nervous system . Dr. Sellards and a collaborator had actually immunized humans with the mouse-adapted virus , with some severe reactions . The method was later modified , producing immunity with less risk , but Theiler was horrified at this use of his virus . Dr. Sawyer also thought the method too risky to be used even on yellow fever workers , who desperately needed protection while they searched for a better vaccine . Nearly everyone who worked with yellow fever contracted it at one time or another , and the fortunate ones , who survived , were sick for weeks . Dr. Sawyer himself had been ill for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit on the idea of injecting Theiler 's tame viruses along with antibody-containing immune serum taken from recovered yellow fever patients , as protection against the virus 's neurotropic tendencies . They ground up virus-infected mouse brains and combined the tissue with immune serum for the injection ; as additional protection , a second injection of pure immune serum was given . In the spring of 1931 , after testing it on monkeys , the vaccine was given to a doctor at the laboratory and other volunteers . It was safe , and it worked , and once it was administered to all yellow fever workers it ended laboratory infections . This vaccine was not very practical because it required human immune serum , and , consequently , it became known as " the rich people 's vaccine . " Researchers at the Yellow Fever Laboratory agreed that it was necessary to further tame the virus so it could be used without serum . Because the virus ? the French strain Dr. Sellards brought from Dakar ? had become neurotropic when Theiler grew it in mouse brains , Theiler and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to test a new technique that had just been developed by two researchers at Vanderbilt University : growing the viruses in chick embryos . After his hero , Adolf Hitler , came to power , Dr. Haagen returned to his homeland , and Dr. Sawyer replaced him with a young Canadian physician , Wray Lloyd , who had collaborated with Sawyer on the vaccine . Theiler and Lloyd were opposites in disposition : Theiler was laconic and apparently unambitious , while Lloyd was a hard worker , expansive , and unabashedly ambitious . Their technician , Nelda Ricci , who was Italian born , rarely arrived at work on time , and anyone who attempted to reprove her did so at their own risk . Although her temper was volatile , Nelda Ricci was an expert at the delicate art of tissue culture ; therefore , bacterial contamination , the bane of tissue-culture work in the days before antibiotics , rarely spoiled her experiments . Under Nelda Ricci 's direction , the viruses , tissue , and a nutritious " soup " were combined in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks , tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 37 ? C. for several days while , if all went well , the viruses multiplied . After centrifuging , some of the sedimented virus was transferred to new flasks with fresh medium to grow again . The culturing of Dr. Sellards 's French strain , begun by Theiler and Haagen , continued . Theiler and Lloyd decided that they would also try to culture the vicious Asibi strain . In 1927 , Asibi , a twenty-eight-year-old black man , had been seen in a village about a hundred miles north of Accra on the Gold Coast . When Rockefeller Foundation doctors first encountered him , Asibi was resting with his head in his hands , feeling very ill . They diagnosed yellow fever and drew some blood . Returning to the village several days later , the doctors learned that their patient had recovered and gone back to work . The virus they isolated from Asibi ? the strain that had killed Adrian Stokes ? was the most lethal yellow fever virus known . The Asibi strain was pantropic : deadly to both viscera and nerve tissue . Theiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // change that might result from culturing would be easily detected . In addition , the Asibi strain had never been passed through mice , although it had been kept alive in the laboratory since 1927 . Theiler and Lloyd tried growing these two yellow fever viruses in every kind of tissue they could think of : whole chick embryo , minced chick embryo , small squares of embryonic skin , chick-embryo brains , tissue from adult mice and guinea pigs , tissue from embryonic mice and guinea pigs , even rodents ' testicular tissue . The French strain multiplied readily , but the Asibi strain refused to grow until they offered it finely minced mouse embryo . After culturing the Asibi strain eighteen times , they again tried growing it in minced chick embryo and chick-embryo brain , and this time , astonishingly , the Asibi virus multiplied . After fifty-eight subcultures , they tried chick embryo with the brain and spinal cord cut out on the theory that the virus might lose its penchant for nerve tissue if it were bred without it ? as the tapeworm lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no need for one . This notion was erroneous , but fortunately they did not realize it . From time to time Lloyd or Theiler injected cultured viruses into mice or monkeys , looking for signs of change . They became discouraged when after a year the French strain was no more or less neurotropic than before . But early in 1935 luck came from a most unlikely source : the virus in flask 17E ? Asibi , grown in mouse-embryo tissue , which had been subcultured some ninety times . They injected it into the bellies of monkeys , and the monkeys survived ! Its viscerotropism had utterly vanished ! Equally remarkable to Lloyd and Theiler was the fact that the virus had also become less neurotropic than the modified French strain , on which they had pinned their hopes . They determined that the new Asibi virus was not sufficiently tame to be used without immune serum for // vaccination , but it was the most well-behaved yellow fever virus anyone had ever seen . Wrav Lloyd prepared a report on their findings and included Nelda Ricci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her skill had been important to their success , and she had done most of the actual tissue-culture work . She had carried on for weeks at a time while Theiler was busy with other projects and Lloyd was away , courting a Uruguayan woman , Chy-Chy Gonzales , whom he hoped to marry . Dr. Sawyer did not approve of Nelda Ricci 's name , or that of any other " nonprofessional " coauthor , on a scientific paper . Lloyd retaliated by tossing the manuscript into a drawer , where it remained for weeks , until Dr. Sawyer , eager to publish such important findings , relented . In the fall of 1935 , Wray Lloyd departed for Brazil to test the 17E vaccine , and Dr. Sawyer assigned Hugh Smith , a physician from South Carolina who had trained at Johns Hopkins , to replace him . That left Theiler , Hugh Smith , Nelda Ricci , and Old William ? Vladimir Glasounov , a Russian who had fled his homeland in 1917 . Before coming to New York , Glasounov had worked at the Rockefeller yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Islam because he had discovered that he could buy groceries at a better price that way . It was Old William who saw to it that the laboratory was always well stocked with mice , monkeys , and sterile glassware ? equipment other laboratories found in short supply . The work Lloyd and Theiler had begun with the Asibi strain went on . " It was a deadly chore , " Theiler complained , but they seemed to be stuck with it . Before he left , Wray Lloyd had selected several strains of the Asibi virus he thought promising , and he had urged that more work be done with them . So Theiler and Smith continued to grow them in chick-embryo tissue with varying amounts of nerve tissue . They cultured Asibi with whole chick embryo ( 17D WC ) , Asibi with chick emN. // bryo brain ( 17D CEB ) , and minced chick embryo with the brain and spinal cord removed ( 17D ) . No progress was being made with the French neurotropic strain ? it remained exactly as it had been ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's laboratory ? so they threw it out and began culturing the unmodified French strain and milder strains from Brazil . " There was no logic here , " Theiler explained later . " We set up a machine and let it run . " Old William assembled the syringes , pipettes , and flasks for Nelda Ricci , who extracted the tissues from interminable thousands of mouse and chick embryos and prepared the culture media . Each time a new culture was started , a sample of the virus from the previous culture flask was removed , dried , and frozen . This was done by a third technician , who also inoculated mice intracerebrally at each tissue-culture passage to determine whether the virus was alive and well and still virulent . Twice a week , " hheiler or Smith injected specimens from each culture flask into mice , and they occasionally inoculated monkeys to test for change . As time passed and nothing happened , they grew bored and tested less often . They kept themselves busy by trying to develop a readv supply of immune scrum from Swiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the first injection of goatserum vaccine ; it made him sick , and after similar reactions in others , the goat scrum was abandoned . The researchers then tried monkey serum , but it also presented difficulties . The culturing , tended mainly by the technicians , dragged on for a year . On a spring morning in 1936 , Hugh Smith arrived in the laboratory , glanced at the records , and noted that some of the mice inoculated with the cultured viruses had survived longer than usual before succumbing . He made it a point to recheck these experiments soon . When he did , he noted strange goings-on . Although the hind limbs of some of the inoculated mice had become paralyzed , the mice had not died . // A few weeks later , these mice were still alive ! Smith also noticed mice inoculated with virus that were surviving without any signs of illness , and he mentioned this to Theiler . During the following weeks , they inoculated more mice and watched them closely . These mice also continued to dash about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mice had been given the same virus ? 17D ? one of the strains Wray Lloyd had selected before leaving for Brazil . It had been cultured first by Lloyd , Theiler , and Ricci , and then by Theiler , Smith , and Ricci ? altogether it had been cultured 176 times . Although Smith and Theiler remained cynical about the results , they decided an acid test for this virus was in order : monkey studies . No one in the laboratory expected what happened next . Eight rhesus monkeys were injected subcutaneously with the 17D virus . All of them soon had mild yellow fever , but all eight survived ? and within a week seven developed immunity ! When the 17D virus was injected directly into the brains of other monkeys , they did not catch encephalitis ; although they became feverish , they quickly recovered . When 17D was injected into their bellies , they showed no signs of sickness . When wild yellow fever viruses were then administered to these monkeys , they still did not become ill . They , too , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good to be true , and he repeated the monkey tests . The better the results looked , the more suspicious Theiler and Smith became . The history of vaccine-making , they well knew , was crowded with apparent successes that had faded ignominiously away , leaving a trail of deaths and ruined careers . Hundreds of tedious tests of the 17D virus were needed , so Theiler was glad to escape the laboratory for a scientific meeting in London in the summer of 1936 . Upon his return , he was not eager to go back to work . " I suppose the reason is that at present the work does n't offer anything particularly exciting , " he // wrote in a letter to his mother . " What has to be done is so perfectly obvious that a good deal of interest is lacking . However , I have some very good assistants , so that I think we can manage a great amount of work in a short time and get the obvious work ' out of the way and commence something new . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Theiler began trying hard to uncover some . He found that " however severe a test we give the vaccine , it comes through with flying colors . " By November , Theiler and Smith decided the time had come to try 171 ) on themselves . Both were already immune to yellow fever , so there was not much of a risk ; they primarily wanted to test for a reaction to the chick-embryo tissue . Following the injections , the researchers ' antibodies increased ; otherwise they had no reaction . Two nonimmune volunteers were then given injections , also with no ill effects , and both became immune . As the test results accumulated , it began to dawn on Theiler and Smith that they had it ! And they realized that it had been right under their noses for quite some time ! Examining the records , they saw that at the 89th subculture , 17D had still been vicious , killing all three monkeys who had received it . No further monkey tests had been done until recently , so they took out the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and injected it into four monkeys . All survived without any signs of illness . Their calculations showed that the amazing mutation had taken place almost a year before they had noticed it ! " The fact of the matter , " Theiler said , " is that we were more interested in other things at the time . " Unfortunately , Wray Lloyd , who had done so much to bring it about did not share in the victory . He had died the previous summer in Brazil . Married to Chv-Chy Gonzales , the daughter of a Uruguayan physician , he was living in Rio de Janeiro when he fell from a window . According to one account , he had been hanging draperies in preparation for a visit with his in-laws ; according to another , he had been sleepwalking. // The 17D viruses were tested by Hugh Smith in Brazil , where a vaccine was urgently needed , leaving Theiler to run the laboratory for a time with little assistance . The weekly quota of 1,500 mice continued to be delivered , and because he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice , he had to try to use them . He hardly had time to reflect that ten years before - he had been forced to beg for six mice , and now Foundation met to consider the new vaccine , they found no reason to believe it would not be absolutely safe for humans , so Theiler suggested they try it themselves . They did , with perfect results . Theiler and Smith had just become convinced that 17D was not merely good but extraordinary when fate dealt Theiler a cruel blow . In March 1937 his eight-vear-old son , Arnold , was hit by a car on his way home from school . The boy never recovered consciousness and died the following morning . " And so ends the most happy little life , " Theiler wrote to his mother several weeks later . " It 's been awful . . . . People are very nice to us but their very kindness was at first the occasion of many exquisite and painful feelings . " The arrival of flowers was most excruciating , reminding him and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take any time off from work , and he found a job in the laboratory for his wife , Lillian . Although they almost never spoke of it afterward , their son 's death left them brokenhearted . His good job , their pleasant home ? all seemed to lose meaning . The only reason for existence , Theiler finally resolved , was to do something worthwhile , " to leave the world a slightly better place to live in . " He worked harder than ever and smoked even more than ever , emptying three packages of cigarettes a day . By mid-March a dozen people , Lillian included , had been vac38 THE VIRUS THAT ATE CANNIBALS cinated . The immediate reaction to the vaccine was very mild ? either nothing at all or only a slight fever seven days after inoculation ? and everyone who received it developed immunity after fourteen days . The news was announced in June 1937 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine . In their report , Theiler and Smith stated that the virus had lost its viscerotropism in mouse-embryo culture and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed . This , they explained , confirmed their theory ? the original hypothesis on which the experiments had been based ? that the amount of nerve tissue present had produced the remarkable mutation . " It would seem reasonable to conclude , " they wrote , " that the changes in the pathogenicity and the tissue affinity that occurred during the prolonged cultivation are in all probability attributable to the different cellular components of the tissue-culture media . " Reasonable as this seemed , their conclusion was not correct . While Hugh Smith directed major vaccine trials in humans , Theiler repeated their laboratory experiments in their entirety to learn more about the mutation . This time he hovered vigilantly over the experiments , waiting for the change . But months , then years went by , and it never came ! Theiler was dumbfounded . Although the wild Asibi virus was cultured precisely as before , more than two hundred times during the next three years , it never again lost its deadly neurotropism . And Asibi virus grown with nerve tissue remained no more or less neurotropic than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again produced a virus like 17D . Theiler continued cultural promising strains in a great variety of media . But the more he learned , the less he understood . Although the French strain , cultured in the same media as before , soon lost its viscerotropism , its neurotropism actually increased in all three cultures , showing no correlation whatever to the amount of nerve tissue present . A mild strain from South // America decreased in neurotropism after 300 subcultures , but the least decrease occurred when the virus was grown with the least amount of nerve tissue . Other strains became so attenuated on repeated culturing that they failed to produce any immunity , even in large doses . It was a humbling experience , and Theiler 's only explanation of the strange , wonderful transformation of the Asibi strain , once the most deadly yellow fever virus of all , was : " There is no explanation . " The riddle of jungle yellow fever was solved one November day in 1940 by a falling tree . The search for the villain had led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their every habit was scrutinized : from blood preferences to feeding patterns , flight ranges , sexual habits , life-spans , and preferred altitudes . There was a suspect : Haentagogus spegazzinii , a small , shiny blue mosquito that is a fierce biter . It inhabits jungles and coffee plantations , and the female drinks plant juices except when it is time to mature her eggs . Then she requires blood . The only drawback to the case was that Haenzagogus spegazzinii is rare , and is never seen during the day . On November 18 , 1940 , a team of researchers led by Dr. Jorge Boshell Manrique were in the mountains of Colombia studying yellow fever when they came across some woodcutters . The researchers stopped and watched as a large tree crashed to the ground . When the tree fell , its upper branches were shorn and it tore branches from surrounding trees as well , releasing clouds of Haemagogus spegazzinii , which promptly descended and attacked the workers . At last the story was pieced together . In South America , Haemagogus spegazzinii inhabits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siestas . The monkeys are too alert at other times to be bitten . Partial to sunlight , these mosquitoes feed only during the day . The researchers realized // that yellow fever passes mainly between mosquitoes and monkeys , and probably between other animals and insects as well ? with humans of little importance to the survival of the virus . In Africa a similar pattern was found . Aedes africanus feeds on monkeys settling down for the night in the treetops ; like Haemagogus spegazzinii , it seldom descends to the ground in quest of human blood . But the monkeys descend in search of bananas on nearby plantations , where they may be bitten by Aedes simpsoni , which also bites humans , thus transmitting yellow fever . After it was perfected , the 17D vaccine proved to be as good as its makers first thought , and it put an end to epidemics of yellow fever . By 1960 , 100 million people had safely received it , and yellow fever was once again , as it had been before it traveled west on slave ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded the Nobel Prize for his work . Dr. Sawyer , who had directed the Yellow Fever Laboratory since 1935 and had developed the first good vaccine , did not take the news well . Friends said he regarded it as a rejection of his life 's work . After the announcement of the award , Wilbur Sawyer spoke of little else . He had already been ill , and at the time he suddenly became much sicker . A month later he was dead . His wife said that the award of the Nobel Prize to Max Theiler , their neighbor and one-time friend , had killed her husband . There were also those who said that Wray Lloyd and Hugh Smith , as well as the Rockefeller Foundation , which had spent millions to fight yellow fever , and many others , including William Gorgas , whose antimosquito campaigns first rid much of the world of yellow fever , should have shared the prize . For once Theiler was not reticent . He was as pleased about winning , he said , as infielder Gil McDougald was when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent world series and the Yankees beat the Giants , 13-1 . He believed that Wray Lloyd and Hugh Smith deserved much credit , but he did n't think // others should have shared in the prize . Other researchers had conic and gone , he pointed out , while he was the only one who had worked continually in the field . And his mouse-modified French strain had made possible all the other vaccines . When he was informed by reporters of the amount of money the prize would bring him , $32,357.62 , he cracked a typical dry joke : " It looks as though yellow fever got me the jackpot . " He told people who asked how he planned to celebrate that he was going to buy a case of Scotch and a season ticket to the Dodgers 's games . But he never did . He continued to spend his leisure time reading , playing with his daughter Elizabeth , and watching baseball on television . As doggedly as he had once studied yellow fever , he now worked on polio , and his studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease in humans . This work was regarded by others as the most imaginative contribution of his career . Later , at Yale University , he became involved in a systematic , world-wide study of insect-carried virus diseases . Theiler believed that the Nobel Prize changed his life in only one respect . At the train station in Hastings-on-Hudson , where he used to catch the New York Central , he was known by his neighbors as " the man who lives next door to Alvin Dark " of the New York Giants . Afterward , he became " the Nobel Prize winner who lives next door to Alvin Dark . " Yellow fever never did get Theiler ; he died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-three in 1972 . WHEN GERMAN TROOPS INVADED Bialystok , Russia , in August 1914 , an eight-year-old Jewish boy fell into step and playfully marched along with them to the center of the town . There , on the courthouse steps , sitting as close as he dared to one of the enemy soldiers , the boy watched him pull out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city had been besieged for some time , and Albert Sabin thought he had never seen a sight as wonderful as that German pumpernickel . He would never forget that pumpernickel , or the soldier who shared it with him . Sabin would remember , too , the great relief of Bialystok 's large Jewish population over the German occupation . His parents noted how much more civilized the Germans seemed than the Cossacks , who had just departed , and when a German school was opened shortly thereafter in Bialystok , the boy was enrolled there . Few Sabins remained in Bialystok at that time . After the pogrom of 1905 , all Albert 's surviving relatives had left the textile center for the United States , except for his immediate family who had stayed to look after his mother 's ill parents . There were 451 // four children in the Sabin family , two younger sisters , an older brother , and Albert . Their father worked as a weaver , at home . They were not desperately poor ? there was money for the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the last family ties were severed , the Sabins packed their belongings and set off for the United States . For months they made their way through Europe , from Warsaw to Danzig to Antwerp , where they were finally able to board a boat for New York . By then , they felt fortunate to travel in steerage . The family settled with relatives in the silk weaving center of Paterson , New Jersey , and Albert 's father and older brother found work in the silk factories . Albert remained in New York for six weeks to be drilled in English , American history , mathematics , and literature by two cousins who were successful civilengineers . Albert knew some English when he arrived in the United States , and by February 1921 he felt prepared to go to school . He presented himself to the principal of Paterson High School with a diploma from the Russian school he had attended . But the principal could n't read Russian . " It means , " said the fourteen-year-old Sabin , " that if my education had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now be a sophomore . " The principal went along with this , but warned Sabin that he had better do well in his studies . He did do well , with coaching from his cousins , but he had to work after school and on Saturdays and studied late into the night . He had no time for sports , although he did join the debating society , which he relished . Sabin graduated in 1923 , at the age of sixteen , and he thought of studying law , but he had no money for college . Then his uncle , a busy dentist , offered to pay his college tuition and provide him with room and board in his New York City apartment if Albert would become a dentist and assist him during his years of training . Shortly thereafter , Sabin was enrolled not only in New York University 's Washington Square College but also in a school for dental technicians , and again he worked long days and evenings . After a year at Washington Square College and two years at the New York University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to fix teeth . Bacteriology interested him far more , and reading Sinclair Lewis and Paul de Kruif , he was enchanted by the microbe hunters . He liked to imagine himself as one , and pushed aside the disquieting thought that all the great work in bacteriology had already been done ? " What is there left for me to do ? Gild the lily ? " He made up his mind to a career in medical research . Hearing of his plans , his uncle ordered him out , in eleven memorable words : " You do n't work for me , I do n't take care of you . " So Sabin again worked at odd jobs to earn money and took premedical courses at Washington Square College . He then attended New York University College of Medicine . Although he had a scholarship , he worked after school at Harlem Hospital to earn his room and board . Dozens of pneumonia patients were admitted to the hospital every day , and it was Sabin 's job to inoculate mice with the patients ' sputum . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sabin would identify the type of pneumococcus that had killed them so the proper antiserum could be administered to the patients . But by then many of the patients were also dead . " My God , " Sabin thought , " should a person have to wait a whole day for treatment when it is a question of life or death ? " It occurred to him to try inserting a capillary tube into the mouse 's belly at hourly intervals , after injecting the sputum , to see when enough pneumococci had appeared to determine their type . He found that the organism could be identified within three hours , which meant that treatment of the patient could begin a whole day earlier than before ! Many lives were saved by this procedure , and Sabin was elated . But his elation did not last long : he soon saw that even when treatment was begun earlier , some of the patients still // succumbed for no apparent reason . He set about learning why , and by the time he graduated from medical school in 1931 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had published several papers on his discoveries . In July of that year a major polio epidemic swept New York City , paralyzing 6,500 persons during the summer and killing many of them . Dr. William H. Park , chief of the bacteriology department at New York University , where Sabin was working , suggested that Sabin investigate polio ; but Sabin was preoccupied with pneumonia and protested that he did n't know much about viruses anyway , other than what he had read . Dr. Park had liked Sabin 's clever method of identifying pneumococci and wanted him to look into a new skin test for polio immunity developed by Professor Claus Jungeblut of Columbia University . So he offered incentives to the ambitious young man : money , more laboratory space , and precious monkeys . Sabin promptly looked into Professor Jungeblut 's test and reported to Dr. Park that the professor was working with an " awful mess of stuff , " and he did n't see how his test could prove anything . It was an impudent remark , but sure enough , when Sabin repeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So Dr. Park encouraged Albert to try purifying some poliovirus . Using the methods of the noted German chemist Willstatter , of Munich , who had purified enzymes , Sabin went to work . Sabin succeeded , much to his surprise , since this had never been done before . Using the purified poliovirus , he again tried to repeat Professor Jungeblut 's test and failed . He went to the professor and asked what he might have done wrong . They repeated the test together , and still it failed to work . Sabin published the bad news , dashing all hopes that the test would be a weapon against the dread disease . Almost nothing was known about polio . There was no preventative , no cure , and no one knew why the disease was becoming epidemic . Poliolike diseases had been described throughThe // out history , but no epidemics had been reported until late in the nineteenth century , in Sweden and the United States . The first great epidemic in the United States did not occur until 1916 , when almost 30,000 people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , polio strikes the base of the brain , rapidly causing coma and death . If the victim survives , paralysis of the respiratory muscles sometimes develops , and these victims are confined to iron lungs , which draw their every breath . Since these victims can not cough ? and the iron lung can not cough for them ? pneumonia eventually sets in and they die . No one survives an iron lung ; death comes in a year or perhaps in ten . In less severe cases , the lower spinal cord is affected , with the virus attacking the anterior horn cells , which provide the nerves of the arms and legs , and victims are left with paralyzed , useless extremities . The disease often struck children , and the twisted , deformed bodies of these small survivors were especially saddening . The alarming trend toward more frequent and widespread polio outbreaks was continuing , and no one , including the most brilliant of Sabin 's professors , had any idea of what to do about it . Sabin savored publishing his paper on the challenging subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sabin was distracted by other matters . A researcher he had known at the City Health Department Laboratories had died suddenly , after being bitten on the hand by a monkey . Sabin obtained some autopsy material and isolated a virus from it . After studying it , he announced that he had found a new virus . A professor at Columbia University disagreed , arguing that it was the wellknown human herpes simplex virus . But this virus , which was harmless to monkeys and fatal to humans , proved to be a new one after all , and Sabin called it herpes B virus after its victim , Dr. Brebner . " Maybe because I wanted it to be a new virus I said it was a new virus , " he remarked later . " I was naive . If I had known more I would have said it was herpes simplex. " // More important than being correct , although he did not mind that in the least , was the lesson that lodged in his head : that evolutionary forms of viruses exist in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was close enough to suggest that they had a common ancestor , and that through evolution they had diverged slightly . Yet both forms existed at once : one less virulent than the other . Because of Sabin 's work with the B virus , he was invited to join the Rockefeller Institute . Not yet thirty , he arrived at the institute in January of 1935 , fresh from a year at London 's Lister Institute , wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe . " God , he was a sight when the arrived , " recalled Tom Rivers , who had found him the job . " I Ic was the most elegant dresser in the entire institute . " He also proved to be , as Rivers had assured the institute 's director , " a nice young Jewish boy who is as smart as all outdoors . " He knew a great deal about viruses , and Rivers found that Sabin " quickly showed that he was capable of doing elegant work in the laboratory . " Sabin , now married , did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a devilish challenge , and no real information had been gained since the institute 's director , Dr. Simon Flexner , had transmitted the disease among monkeys in 1909 . The greatest obstacle was that the virus could not be grown in the laboratory . Sabin and his boss , Peter Olitsky , tried culturing the virus in different human tissues and discovered that it could indeed be grown in culture ? but only in human nervous cells . Their experiments , which were done with the utmost care and precision , were hailed as a major breakthrough . Neither the researchers nor anyone else suspected that the Rockefeller Institute strain of poliovirus they had used in the studies had led them into a trap . Another important concept about polio established at about the same time , in the mid-1930s , was that the virus invades the human body through the nose and from there travels its deadly // course along the olfactory pathway to the brain . This was supported by Sabin 's findings of incriminating lesions left by the virus on the neurons of monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a nasal spray of certain chemicals might prevent polio ; and in monkeys this seemed to be the case . When children were tested , however , the nose spray failed to prevent the disease , and some of the children permanently lost their sense of smell . Two far more calamitous efforts at preventing polio followed in 1935 . Inspired by Pasteur 's rabies vaccine , made fifty years before from the spinal cord of rabies-infected rabbits , two American researchers made separate attempts to produce a vaccine for polio . Maurice Brodie , at New York University , infected monkeys with poliovirus , killed the monkeys and ground up their infected spinal cords . This substance he treated with formalin to inactivate the virus , before injecting it into monkeys . Dr. Kolmer , of Philadelphia , also worked with monkeys ' spinal cords , but they contained live , untreated viruses he believed he had weakened ? as Pasteur had weakened the rabies virus ? by transmitting them repeatedly from animal to animal . Brodie and Kolmer tested their vaccines on a few monkeys before administering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few vaccinated children were stricken with polio and died . It was a tragedy not only for the victims and the scientists ? Brodie later killed himself ? but also for the cause , for it demonstrated the extreme complexity of the enemy . " The correct question , " Sabin saw , " was not how to make a polio vaccine , but rather , could a vaccine be made ? " Sabin believed that polio called for a full-scale military campaign . He had grown up in the midst of war ( after the Cossacks and Germans left Bialystok , the Polish army arrived , followed by the Bolsheviks , all before the region was restored to Poland in 1919 ) and he was well aware that the first step in a successful campaign is reconnaissance . " It would be necessary to determine // the enemy 's strengths and weaknesses , its hiding places , its different faces . How many different kinds of polioviruses were there ? Where in nature did they multiply in the numbers necessary to ensure their continued existence ? Where in the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from the body ? How many different kinds of immunity did they produce ? How long did immunity last ? " The failure of nose sprays to halt polio had made Sabin doubt the olfactory-pathway concept . Perhaps , he thought , polio in monkeys was one thing and polio in humans was quite another . " Human beings would have to be studied , " he decided , " to understand the human disease . " So Sabin did something quite simple : he examined the olfactory bulbs of a polio victim . Not finding any lesions , he examined more cases , and still there were no signs of lesions . After further studies he was forced to conclude that in human beings polioviruses do not enter through the nose or multiply mainly in the nose , as was widely believed , but rather they first multiply in the intestines . How did they wind up there ? By way of the mouth most likely , he thought ; but it was ten years before this theory was confirmed . Sabin and researchers at Yale and Johns Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimpanzees and painstakingly charted their progress . From the mouth , they learned , polioviruses progress to the intestinal tract , where they settle in the intestinal lining to multiply . There , the viruses are routed by the lymph system into the bloodstream , where they multiply in other non-nervous tissues before invading the spinal cord and other parts of the brain . Finally , and here the stunning insidiousness of the scheme was at last revealed , some of the live viruses are excreted and set free , ensuring that all the viruses will not be buried along with their victims . Sabin began to wonder if the idea was not to try thwarting such an awesome natural scheme , but to use nature to somehow // get around nature . He began to wonder if vaccine viruses might follow the same route as the wild viruses . . . . As the years passed , polio epidemics worsened . Tens of thousands died of the disease , and by the late 1940s there were hundreds of thousands of crippled survivors , many of them children . Some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs ; the others could be seen on the streets of almost every city and town in the United States . The disease was not as great a killer as influenza , but these survivors were a constant reminder of the disease . Partly because of them and partly because of the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis , the battle against polio became the greatest voluntary crusade against a disease of all time . The National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis , founded in 1937 by President Franklin Roosevelt , himself crippled by polio , was directed by the president 's friend , Basil O'Connor , a Wall Street lawyer . Under O'Connor 's flamboyant supervision , the foundation 's appeals , notably the March of Dimes , raised billions of dollars ? about $25 million a year ? between 1938 and 1972 . " Mv name is virus poliomyelitis , " began one of the foundation 's famous fund-raising films . " I consider myself quite an artist , a sort of sculptor . I specialize in grotesques . . . " Among the many researchers who were supported by foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young professor at the University of Pittsburgh , who offered the most immediate prospect of producing a vaccine . He was Jonas Salk . Like Albert Sabin , he was young , energetic , smart , and aggressive , not one to waste time when it came to pursuing a promising opportunity . In 1949 the result of a vast study comparing viral samples from thousands of polio victims was announced : although many strains of poliovirus had been found , there were only three different antigenic types . This fact ? that there were only three kinds // of virus to immunize against ? meant that making a vaccine suddenly seemed much more possible . That same year Sabin and Olitsky 's classic studies showing that poliovirus could grow only in nervous tissue were overturned by Dr. John Enders and two associates at Children 's Hospital in Boston , who worked with different strains of the virus . They used foreskin tissue for their first experiments and later grew the viruses in monkey kidneys . This discovery , for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize , was a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may induce neurologic disease ? a lesson painfully learned by previous vaccinemakers . Sabin and Olitsky had experimented with a strain that had been passed through monkeys ' brains so often it simply lost its ability to multiply in non-nervous tissue . " Work with monkeys led to many misunderstandings , " Sabin would say ruefully long afterward , though he could chuckle over " the luck that I happened to work at the Rockefeller Institute and got my hands on Simon Flexner 's old poliovirus that had been around since 1909 ! " If Sabin and Olitsky had worked with a different strain of poliovirus , virologist Tom Rivers felt , " the chances are that they would have been able to grow the virus in non-nervous tissue , and we would have had a breakthrough of major proportions in making a vaccine . As it was , we had to wait fourteen years for this particular breakthrough . " Almost everything that was learned about polio in the next several years continued to point to the possibility of making a vaccine . A study of isolated Eskimos revealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years or more . Dr. Dorothy Horstmann of Yale University found that in humans poliovirus enters the blood during the early stages of the disease , suggesting that small amounts of circulating antibody might be able to destroy the virus before it reached the central nervous system . // ( It had been thought that the virus did not enter the blood , because it had left the blood and invaded the brain by the time anyone got around to looking for it . ) It was also learned that a poliovirus infection not only causes antibody formation in the bloodstream but also resistance to infection in the intestines ? pointing to the possibility of eliminating the viruses ' very breeding ground ? the intestine ? with a vaccine before it ever reached the bloodstream . Most compelling , Albert Sabin thought , was the fact that several strains of poliovirus had been tamed . By the early 1950s , Max Theiler , who tamed the yellow fever virus , had modified a strain of poliovirus by transferring it from monkeys to rats and then to mice . When fed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Enders and other researchers had also produced experimentally weakened strains , and this greatly impressed Sabin . " A poliovirus is not a poliovirus , " he kept repeating to himself , and he gradually determined that the correct approach would be to take " hot " viruses and tame them or to select from nature " good " viruses , i.e. , viruses that multiplied in the intestinal tract and stimulated the production of antibodies but that multiplied very little , or not at all , in the human nervous system . These good viruses , which would still resemble their vicious relatives sufficiently to stimulate antibody formation in the blood and resistance in the intestines , would be fed to people in imitation of a natural infection . Hunting down or breeding such viruses would be an enormous task . He would be looking for not just one good virus , as Max Theiler had been , but one for each of the three different antigenic types that caused polio . But Sabin saw no good reason it should n't work . " Obviously , factors involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he reasoned . " So , if by natural selection polioviruses with certain traits advantageous to // the poliovirus came to dominate ? and they did , clearly ? then by experimental selection , why not try to select polioviruses which would favor humans ? " No one had ever immunized people by feeding them live , infectious viruses , but the histories of smallpox , rabies , and yellow fever showed Sabin that only live viruses made a good vaccine . It was an audacious idea , but then he was frequently accused of being an audacious person . Before Sabin arrived at the Rockefeller Institute , it had been rumored that he would appropriate all the monkeys in the place for his own use , and colleagues later complained that Sabin demanded and usually got things they would never think of even asking for . " A supreme egotist , " commented one associate . " A very unpleasant individual , " said another . But a third attributed Sabin 's unpopularity to his habit of saying exactly what was on his mind : " He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he looked at more thoroughly and clearly , and thus could promptly relate the significance of a problem to the world at large . In his forthright , confident manner he would explain to them , and . . . they would resent being given the answer by a tyro much younger than they . " Jonas Salk had set promptly to work , in 1950 , experimenting with the many new techniques for culturing viruses in monkey tissue . Before long he was successfully harvesting large quantities of virus , and he announced that he could produce a safe , effective polio vaccine . Like the influenza vaccine he had worked on during the Second World War , this would be a " killed " - virus vaccine . He spent the early 1950s searching for suitable strains of each of the three types of poliovirus ? strains that were virulent enough to promote good antibody formation , but ones that were easily inactivated . The viruses would also have to grow well in culture . For Type III poliovirus , Salk selected a strain that had been isolated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Type II he chose a virus isolated from a young American polio victim , James Saukett . For Type I , Salk settled on the notorious Mahoney strain , as deadly a poliovirus as anyone had ever encountered . It had spread from a family named Mahoney in Akron , Ohio , to some of their neighbors , whom it had killed . Salk was criticized for including the Mahoney strain in a vaccine , but he liked it ; the Mahoney strain , once inactivated with formalin , still stimulated antibodies , and it thrived in tissue culture . Next , Salk labored over the process that would inactivate the viruses , to be certain that not a single viral particle remained alive . Unlike Maurice Brodie 's disastrous methods , Salk 's procedure was highly scientific . He carefully studied the amount of formalin necessary and the time required to " cook " the viruses and developed an inactivation curve , to determine the precise point at which all the viruses would be dead . The trouble was that as the process continued and the number of active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he added more time to the procedure as a safety margin . Sabin and others strongly disapproved not only of Salk 's use of the extremely dangerous Mahoney strain in a vaccine but also of the inactivation procedure . But Salk remained adamant on both points . Sabin , now at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine , was busy searching for docile viruses . Experimenting with one strain after another , he grew the viruses in monkey-kidney cultures , harvested them , and cultured them again and again , altering conditions to favor the appearance and overgrowth of viruses with very precise characteristics : nonvirulent but antigenic and able to proliferate in human intestines . Sabin postulated that when advantage was given to viruses that multiplied first in non-nervous cells , he would obtain viruses that were less virulent . But he found that some of the progeny of these viruses were tame and others virulent . So he began diluting out the undesirable viruses , theoretically to the point at which // they would be completely gone . The remaining viruses were cultured and inoculated into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow work , tampering with evolution . Jonas Salk 's vaccine progressed much more rapidly . Early in 1953 , after he had tested his killed viruses on monkeys , Salk informed the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis that he had also tested his vaccine on small numbers of institutionalized children in Pennsylvania ? with excellent results . Critics thought Salk 's vaccine was far from ready for large-scale testing , but the National Foundation disagreed , and preparations were begun for nationwide field trials involving hundreds of thousands of children . Later in the year Sabin informed the foundation of his own good news : he had nonvirulent forms of all three types of poliovirus in hand . When he fed the new viruses to monkeys and then inoculated the monkeys ' brains with lethal doses of wild poliovirus , they did not become ill . He suggested to the foundation that this approach might produce a better vaccine than Jonas Salk 's . Sabin was informed that the foundation would support Salk 's vaccine . Thoroughly annoyed , Sabin went back to work . In the spring of 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin , Sabin learned something very important . When he inoculated the gray matter of monkeys ' spinal cords with his new mutant viruses , paralysis occurred , but when he inoculated chimpanzees in the spine with the same viruses , they did not become ill . The nervous system of monkeys , which are lower primates , in other words , was more susceptible to poliovirus than the nervous system of chimpanzees and by analogy , humans ! Yet the reverse was true for the intestinal tract ; the human intestinal tract was easily infected by doses of poliovirus that were ineffective in chimpanzees , and the chimpanzee 's intestinal tract was in turn more susceptible than that of monkeys . Further , the two traits , nonvirulence for the nervous system and the abilThe // ity to multiply in the human intestines , were not genetically linked to each other ! What more could one ask of nature ! With this discovery , Sabin knew he had it . He had isolated polioviruses that were potentially safe for humans , and he now knew how to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Infantile Paralysis did not concur . The foundation 's virologists pointed out that no one knew how stable these new viruses were and expressed concern that once they were unleashed from the laboratory , they might revert to their old ways . Sabin was enraged . Tom Rivers , head of the foundation 's vaccine committee , recalled in his memoir : " He just about went up like a skyrocket . " A few weeks later , Sabin recovered himself enough to demand a thousand monkeys . " What do you do , eat the monkeys ? " Rivers shouted , and he again said no . Sabin had already used a thousand monkeys that spring , Rivers reminded him , and monkeys , which were scarce to begin with , were needed now to produce Salk 's vaccine . Sabin remarked that the foundation had supported him only as long as they had thought his vaccine would n't work . He wanted to tell Rivers and Basil O'Connor and his foundation exactly what he thought of them , but he knew that working on polio in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , Sabin asked the foundation for permission to administer his viruses to human subjects , and after more infuriating months of delay ( while testing of Salk 's vaccine proceeded ) permission was finally granted . When he administered his three strains to susceptible prisoners in an Ohio penitentiary during the winter of 1954 , no one became ill , and all developed antibodies in their blood and resistance in their intestinal tract . Then on April 12 , 1955 ? the anniversary of President Roosevelt 's death ? the outcome of the Salk vaccine trials was announced by the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis at // the University of Michigan . There were 150 television , radio , and newspaper reporters in attendance , and 16 television and newsreel cameras recorded the proceedings . The occasion , the New York Times noted , was more in keeping with a Hollywood premiere than a great moment in medical history . It was reported that 440,000 children in forty-four states had received the vaccine and that it had been found safe and effective . The vaccine was , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huge supplies of the vaccine , already on hand in anticipation of the event , were distributed across the country . Word spread around the world that polio had been defeated . Jonas Salk was a hero . Two weeks later , after almost half a million children had been inoculated , there was shocking news : a few of the vaccinated children were ill with polio . No one knew how many might be affected or what had gone wrong . The program was quickly halted . Several hundred vaccine-related cases of polio resulted ; 150 children were paralyzed and 11 children died . Federal investigations were held , and accusations flew . The immediate problem was determined to be Salk 's inactivation procedure , which when practiced on a smaller scale for the field trials , had killed the viruses . But when formalin was added to large batches of virus , precipitated protein had formed a shell around some of the viruses , protecting them from the action of the chemical . The questions of how the live viruses had eluded safety testing and whether the Mahoney strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of lawsuits that were not resolved for decades . The firm that produced the faulty vaccine , Cutter Laboratories , was accused of carelessness . Jonas Salk and Basil O'Connor were blamed for their haste in giving the public a vaccine and for the secrecy that had surrounded the research . After more stringent safety-testing procedures were instituted , // vaccinations were resumed . But Albert Sabin , John Enders , and other virologists argued that the program should not resume until less virulent viruses could he tested . No matter how often he diluted his new viruses , Sabin could not manage to purify them completely . Viruses that were sufficiently tame did not always multiply well , and those that did multiply sometimes partially reverted to virulence in later generations . It did not help Sabin that many people seemed hell-bent on convincing him that his vaccine was a failure . After the tests on prisoners , when he learned that some of the viruses were reverting , Tom Rivers , his old friend , said , " Look , why do n't you throw this stuff down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a new technique was introduced by the eminent virologist , Renato Dulbecco , for obtaining the progeny of single virus particles , and Sabin saw a potential use for it . Rivers organized a conference early in 1956 to discuss the technique . " Usually when Sabin attends a meeting or conference , " Rivers said , " he does the telling , and more often than not it is worthwhile because Sabin is a very smart hombre . " But this time he invited a lot of " heavy guns " ? Renato Dulbecco , Joshua Lederberg , MacFarlane Burnet , Max Delbriick , and Salvador Luria ? to do the talking . Sabin did listen , and following the conference he took his three best strains and went to work with Dulbecco . In petri dishes they placed individual viral particles on a thin layer of cells and fixed them in place with an agar gel . Each virus produces a colony ( clone ) , which is called a placque because it is essentially a hole in the cell laver . Thus each placque contained the progeny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing them on large numbers of monkeys , that his strains were indeed not homogeneous . With repeated placquing he had what he wanted before the // end of the year : three strains that were less virulent than any he had previously tested . When he inoculated these viruses into the ultrasensitive gray matter of monkeys ' spinal cords , they only rarely caused mild paralysis , and when very large doses were given , the paralysis did not spread . Even the foundation approved of his viruses , and he resumed testing them on volunteers . By 1957 he had carried out tests on 10,000 monkeys , over a hundred chimpanzees , and several hundred prisoners , and Sabin had even eaten the viruses himself ? there was little danger in this since he already possessed some immunity to polio . But so far all the subjects had been adults , and because the vaccine would eventually have to be given to children , it would first have to be tested on unimmunized children . Sabin thought of his daughters , Debbe and Amy , who were five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity to polio because he had tested them himself ? and he wondered if he could give them the vaccine . Although he was invariably much too busy to be a good father or husband , after fourteen childless years of marriage , he did not take his children lightly . He had been so pleased at becoming a father , in fact , that he imprudently confided to reporters later , at the Hotel d'Angleterre in Copenhagen , that his first child had been conceived in that very hotel . Although he had been speaking strictly off the record , the story about his " Danish baby " appeared on the front page of the Copenhagen newspapers the next day , while some news about his vaccine was barely visible in a lower corner . He knew he had reached the turning point : if he were not prepared to give the vaccine to his own children , he could never give it to anyone else 's . It would be the end of the road for his vaccine . He and his wife , Sylvia , discussed it repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what he was thinking of doing . He had worked for twenty-five years to reach this point , taken every conceivable precaution , tested the // strains in every possible way . But a slight risk remained . All risk could never be eliminated . To make the matter even more difficult , others would be involved . Sylvia , who had been raised on an Illinois farm , had no immunity to any of the three types of polio , nor did their neighbors or their neighbors ' three children , who would also be put at risk . Finally , his wife and the neighbors were willing , and he could n't find a good excuse for not going ahead . Sabin fed the first type of weakened poliovirus in cherry syrup to his daughters , wife , the neighbors and their children . His daughters cried as he swabbed their throats , stuck needles in their arms , and demanded specimens of their excretions , and it was many years before they forgave him for this ordeal . He did this three times a week for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after giving them the second and third types . Debbe , Amy , Sylvia , and neighbors all remained healthy , and the viruses behaved in them exactly as they had been bred to , proliferating in the intestines and triggering antibody formation and intestinal resistance . Viruses retrieved from their feces seemed to be highly attenuated . After additional tests were done on children in the United States , Mexico , Europe , and the Soviet Union , the next logical step was a large-scale field trial . But Sabin faced the immediate problem of where to hold it . There were few communities in the United States where none of the children had received the Salk vaccine . As Sabin was considering this , he received distressing news from the foundation : they were not going to approve a field trial of his vaccine in the United States anyway . There were still concerns about reversion of the viruses to virulence . A year before , it was pointed out to Sabin , Dr. Hilary Koprowski of Lederle Laboratories had tested attenuated polioviruses in Ireland , and two strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His strains were different from Koprow64 THE VIRUS THAT ATE CANNIBALS ski 's , and he had demonstrated that his strains would not revert significantly . He realized that if the National Foundation prevailed , his vaccine might never have a chance . But he did not know what to do . Sabin was at wits ' end when , in 1957 , the World Health Organization assumed authority over all polio immunization and promptly endorsed field trials of his vaccine . But the problem of where to hold them remained . Dr. Koprowski had tested his vaccine in the Congo and Ireland , and other attenuated strains had been tried in Central and South America . Most other developed countries had administered the Salk vaccine . Then Sabin recalled how smug Russian scientists had been at international conferences a few years back over the absence of polio epidemics in the Soviet Union . He had been amused when a Soviet delegation subsequently arrived in the United States to learn how to make the Salk vaccine . Sabin invited the Russians to visit his laboratory in Cincinnati . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his live vaccine and offered them the opportunity to try it in their country . He was soon invited to the Soviet Union , and arrangements were made for a collaboration . Sabin was impressed by the speed with which the Russians got to work . They conducted trials on hundreds , then thousands , then millions of children . He knew that his vaccine was good , but he did not know until the Soviet study was completed how practical it was on a large scale . In June 1959 at a World Health Organization conference in Washington , D.C. , Sabin summarized his own studies and reported the results of studies done on 4.5 million people who had received either a vaccine from Sabin or from secondary lots prepared in the Poliomyelitis Institute in Moscow . Everyone vaccinated showed an immune response and none became ill with polio . In vast , meticulous follow-up studies , the Soviets reported no ill effects either on the unvaccinated in any of the communities where immunization had taken place . // The report on Sabin 's vaccine was so impressive that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and scientists that the Russians might not be as careful about their research as the Americans . So teams of American scientists were dispatched to the Soviet Union in 1959 and 1960 to assess the trials ; but they uncovered no flaws . Testing continued , particularly because of the question about reversion to virulence . Sabin found that his modified viruses , after passing through volunteers more than half a dozen times , showed a slight increase in virulence when he injected them into the ultrasensitive spinal cords of monkeys . But feeding the virus by mouth is very different from injecting it directly into the nervous system , and this was not judged to be a serious concern . Still , more information was needed , and Sabin personally directed a community-wide test of the vaccine in Cincinnati in 1960 . About 200,000 children , their families , and the population of the surrounding region were studied . Some of the children received vaccine , while others did not . Then the effects of the spread of the vaccine viruses within the homes and the community were observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who developed any kind of neurologic symptoms during the period of the study was brought to Sabin 's attention and thoroughly assessed . " These were heroic studies , " Sabin himself did not hesitate to point out . " Nothing like it had ever been done before . " Already , more than 6 million people worldwide had been successfully immunized with his vaccine , and in December of 1959 the Ministry of Health of the Soviet Union had approved the vaccine for general use . In 1960 , millions in the Soviet Union and the satellite countries received the three types of live vaccine . In the United States and other countries Sabin 's vaccine had dramatically halted epidemics , and Sabin was becoming very impatient . His vaccine had been studied more thoroughly than any other in history ? Salk 's vaccine had been tested on 400,000 people // before being licensed ? and his oral vaccine was already widely accepted and used abroad , often to the exclusion of Salk vaccine . Yet in the United States , only the Salk vaccine was licensed for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing out its many proven advantages . The live vaccine gave two kinds of protection : it stimulated the formation of antibodies in the bloodstream , like killed vaccine ; but it also produced intestinal resistance to infection , while killed vaccine produced little if any intestinal resistance . Thus , only live , oral vaccine would reduce the chance of intestinal infection by wild polioviruses and would eliminate the very real danger of vaccinated persons ' transmitting virulent poliovirus , from their intestines , to the unvaccinated . Furthermore , live vaccine caused antibodies to form much more quickly than killed vaccine ? in days rather than in weeks or months ? which meant that live vaccine was useful during an epidemic whereas killed vaccine was not . Live vaccine was also less expensive to make and administer and induced longer-lasting immunity than killed vaccine . Thus , it would be more useful in poorer countries and stood a better chance of being effective . Further , the live vaccine conveyed immunity to some who had never received it by passage of the attenuated viruses from vaccinated to unvaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , live vaccine might alter the very ecology ? with the attenuated viruses multiplying to the extent that they would outnumber the wild viruses . " With live vaccine , you do n't get rid of polioviruses , " Sabin said . " You get rid of the viruses that cause paraly-sis ! " It was an extraordinary concept , Sabin pointed out ? there was no other vaccine like it , and he failed to understand why there was such reluctance to accept it . " Was I impatient ? " he once bellowed at a visitor , full of remembered anger twenty years after the fact . " Of course I was impatient ! As a result of this stupid ? excuse me , that 's exactly what I mean ? stupid reluctance to acThe // cept my vaccine , people were being crippled ! People were dying ! " It did not seem to matter what he said . In the United States , the debate went on . The Salk vaccine had saved thousands of lives and had dramatically reduced the number of polio cases from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,500 a year in the next five years . But after five years of use , Sabin and his advocates pointed out , Salk vaccine had not eliminated the disease in the United States , and worse , some of the polio victims had previously been given Salk vaccine . But Salk and his followers maintained that to give a vaccine of live viruses was to sow the seeds for disaster . The two became bitter antagonists , and before the issue was settled they confronted each other many times . Once , before television cameras , Sabin informed Salk : " Two thousand cases of paralytic polio in the United States , if they can be prevented , are two thousand cases too many . There is no irreducible minimum , ' sir . I disagree with that . " Salk seemed momentarily at a loss for words , although he continued to claim long after the issue had been settled that his arch-rival 's vaccine represented an insidious danger . By the summer of 1960 more than 100 million people worldwide had been immunized with Sabin 's vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had immediately ended . In August the Public Health Service , ever more cautious after the early troubles with the Salk vaccine , finally approved Sabin 's vaccine , but commercial production did not begin until 1961 . In much of the world , Sabin 's vaccine was already used exclusively , and wherever it was n't in use , he went and lobbied for it . Although East Germany had live vaccine , West Germany still used killed vaccine and they were not about to have a " Communist vaccine " ? until an epidemic broke out and their vaccine could not stop it . In Japan the story of reluctance was similar ; a change was not made until an epidemic in 1961 struck children who had received Salk vaccine earlier that year . In Italy , Sabin repri68 THE VIRUS THAT ATE CANNIBALS manded officials who for obscure reasons had warehouses full of live vaccine that was not being distributed , although there were thousands of cases of polio in Italy . A new minister of health organized a nationwide vaccination program with live vaccine , and polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States powerful interests had opposed the change to oral vaccine : Basil O'Connor , the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis , and eminent scientists had staked their reputations on killed vaccine . There were , too , the interests of the vaccine manufacturers . Killed vaccine was much more profitable than oral vaccine , which cost only pennies per dose . Further , it was not known what new difficulties and lawsuits might befall the makers of a new vaccine . " To say that I fought the pressure to keep the vaccine out of use like an amoeba at the bottom of the ocean would be wrong , " Sabin said . " I sometimes behaved more like a tiger , but I used facts . I used data . And the point was that I had to do it , because until 1961 , I did n't have an organization to back me . Jonas Salk had an organization , the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis . " It seemed to Sabin almost miraculous that his vaccine prevailed , though in retrospect he thought that maybe it had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been necessary to establish beyond any doubt that there was no danger from a vaccine that tampered not only with individuals but with the very ecology itself . In June 1961 , following a study by a special committee , the American Medical Association recommended that everyone , regardless of how many doses of Salk vaccine they had received , be vaccinated with the live vaccine . A physician in Phoenix , Arizona , Dr. Richard Johns , developed a program that helped accomplish this called " Sabin on Sundays . " Jonas Salk maintained that his vaccine was protecting people against Sabin 's vaccine , that if his had not been given first , Sabin 's would have caused calamity . But once licensed , Albert Sabin 's // live vaccine came to be used exclusively in the United States , as it already was in most of the world . In 1955 the Soviet Union reported 17,000 cases of polio ; in the same year , 27,000 cases were reported in other European countries , and more than 30,000 were reported in the United States , Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together . By 1967 , following the introduction of Sabin 's live vaccine in these countries , the total number of cases declined to 1,000 ? an extraordinary reduction of almost 99 percent in a dozen years . This is not to say that polio has been conquered . As later outbreaks of polio among unvaccinated English children and the Amish of Pennsylvania so plainly showed , the virulent viruses are still out there , awaiting the opportunity to rush in . But after Sabin 's vaccine had been in use for five years , the number of cases in the United States dropped to less than twenty a year , and by 1975 the disease had been put completely under control . It was one of the great medical triumphs of the century . Day One THE VICTIM STEPS into an empty elevator . Mistakenly , she presses the lobby button and then the " 5 " for her floor . It was the same elevator the night watchman had been riding seconds earlier on his way home from work . On the ride down he had been singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold spring weather and sneezed again , covering his mouth with his hand . Impatiently , he punched the lobby button again . Walking along the hall to her office , the victim pulls a windblown strand of hair from the corner of her eve , using her right index finger and thumb . Using an ordinary microscope , no one would detect anything unusual about the victim 's finger , or the lobby button , or the air in the elevator ? just the several million drops of moisture spewed into the air by the guard 's singing and sneezing . No one would see the billions of infinitesimally small specks of " dust " clinging to each drop . When the victim caught her breath in the elevator , a quarter 73 // of a million of these moist , dust-laden particles lodged in the minute hills and valleys of her nose and began drifting along the membrane lining toward her throat . Her fingers conveyed a second invasion from the elevator button to her eve . Like undulating seaweed , invisibly wafting , the cilia lining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of six hundred sweeps per minute . But the massive invasion of particles overwhelms them , and the dust entrenches itself in the warm moist terrain . Drifting randomly , some of the dust particles bump into cells of the nose 's membrane lining . The attraction is irresistible , and the particles cling to these cells . Minute , twenty-sided polyhedra resembling geodesic domes , these particles are rhino , or " nose " viruses . So overwhelming is the attraction of the rhinoviruses for the cells of the nose that they ignore all others in favor of them . If they were rabies viruses , they would attack brain cells ; if they were influenza viruses , they would fasten onto lung cells . Very soon , hundreds of thousands of viruses are glued to the surface of the cells in the nose . Feeling the virus clinging to its skin , these cells pucker up , surround the rhinovirus , and drink it in . Influenza viruses ? even more boldly ? blast a hole in the cell membrane and fire their contents inside . Having admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errs again and obligingly dissolves the virus 's coat of armor with an enzyme intended to kill . In doing so it unleashes the virus 's deadly essence : viral nucleic acid , which will direct the virus 's reproduction . Once undressed , the virus is ready to begin its reproductive rites . Lacking the essential machinery and materials for this , it rapidly wrests control of the cell 's manufacturing center , subverting its processes so the cell will produce new viruses rather than cellular materials . The takeover , executed as strategically as a spaceship lift-off , starts with the firing up of viral genes that locate and shut down the cell 's factory . // By the end of the day , the manufacturing centers in as many as 900,000 of the victim 's nose cells are completely shut down . A second battery of viral genes fires up , directing cell-factory production of viral nucleic acid . Day Two When sufficient supplies of nucleic acid have been made , a third series of viral genes activates , switching production to proteins for the virus 's armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the coat the virus will wear when it emerges into the world , and the cell is " instructed " how to manufacture those . In hours , production work is complete and assembly of the young viruses begins in the cells . There is nucleic acid at the center of each new virus , and surrounding it , the protein-coat molecules in a tight triangular arrangement , forming the new twenty-sided polyhedron . The progeny , as many as one hundred in each cell , assemble naturally : it is the path of least resistance . As early as twenty-four hours after the viruses invaded the nose , the new generation of viruses make their escape , massing toward the edges of the cells and bursting in a silent fireworks through the membranes . Fatally wounded , the cells will soon die . Within the hour , viral progeny ? 90 million strong ? from the 900,000 cells drift toward healthy cells . Arriving at her office in the morning , the victim coughs and clears her throat . " A sore throat ? " she wonders and decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation disappears after a few swallows , but she tosses down some vitamin C tablets anyway . In her throat , the viruses have been facing a tough battle . When she coughs , thousands land on her desk , and under the bright light , they survive only minutes . Others are washed into her stomach on floods of tea and water , where they are instantly devoured by acid . // Another contingent of viruses , drifting along , runs into trouble in the tonsils and adenoids , where it sets off an alarm in the victim 's immune system . Patrolling Lymphocytes , responding to the alarm , attack and kill many of the viruses and transport others back to lymph-node headquarters for scrutiny . Observing the pattern on the invader 's coat of armor , the immune system begins producing antibodies that will seek out and kill the viruses . But there are far more of the enemy than the lymphocytes can rout , and several thousand viruses gain a hold . Day Three Some of the first 90 million viruses manufactured by the occupied cells have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of viral progeny ? 9 billion of them ? floods into circulation . Dead nose cells begin to accumulate by the millions , and the body secretes fluid to wash them from the battlefield . The victim experiences a slightly runny nose . Day Four A third generation of viruses pours into the victim 's system . There are now close to a trillion , and for every virus the lymphocytes manage to kill , 10,000 new ones take its place . The victim awakes feeling miserable . Her eyes and nose are rivers , her head aches , her throat is dry and sore . She calls in sick , huddles in bed , drinks orange juice , and takes aspirin and vitamin C tablets . The viruses continue to proliferate and cell losses rise even higher . Day Five Something changes . The virus abruptly stops infecting new cells , and the body begins to wash away dead cells and rhinoviruses in great numbers . The victim feels better and returns to // work , although she suffers cold symptoms for the next several days . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , the viruses stop invading cells and the cold ends . Antibodies , of course , limit or prevent the spread of a cold , but antibody levels have not been observed to rise significantly until after a cold has peaked . The viruses ? rhinoviruses ? which cause most of the billion colds in the United States each year and the loss of an estimated 40 million workdays and 30 million school days annually , have been studied intensively . There are more than one hundred varieties of rhinovirus , and antibiotics are not effective against any of them . The existence of so many cold viruses means that a vaccine can not be made . Since antibodies to one strain do not prevent infection by another , protection would require a huge vaccine of all one hundred viruses , and such a vaccine would be too dilute ( there would be too little of each virus ) to stimulate the formation of antibodies . It would not be practical to vaccinate people against several strains of rhinovirus at a time until overall immunity is built up because resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-lived , lasting only a year or two . Nor is it possible to vaccinate against a prevalent strain , as with influenza , because several different rhinoviruses may be prevalent at once , and new strains quickly appear and disappear . Moreover , other families of viruses can also cause colds , and there are even some colds for which no virus can be found . None of this was suspected in 1946 when Christopher Howard Andrewes , an English doctor , launched his all-out assault against the common cold . The " cold virus , " as it was called then , was a vexing entity about which much less was known than most other viruses . That is , most scientists believed the agent was a virus ( since it passed through filters ) , but no one had been able to ca THE VIRUS THAT ATE CANNIBALS ture it . The few attempts to discover the origin of colds , the causes , and how they spread had ended in frustration and confusion . Because the virus could not be isolated , there was no way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it revealed itself in humans and chimpanzees . So a primitive test had been devised : secretions were washed from the throat and nose of a cold sufferer , strained through membranes too fine to let bacteria through , and dropped in the noses of chimpanzees or human volunteers . If colds appeared , it meant the secretions were infectious . But the yield was erratic : the results were often not reproducible , and sometimes no colds appeared ? and no one could explain why . When Christopher Andrewes informed the director of England 's National Institute for Medical Research that he intended to take on the common cold , the director had temporized : " Well , you 've got courage . " Andrewes had stumbled into viral research completely by luck , and bad luck at that . As an adolescent he had suddenly started to grow several inches at a time and his circulatory system was temporarily left behind , causing attacks of faintness and weakness . In winter , when the condition was worse , he was confined to bed , and he resorted to watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writing down what he saw . At school Andrewes had been assigned to classics , " a fate that befell anyone in those days who was of above average intelligence . " But after he won first prize in an essay contest sponsored by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds for his observations on how the feet and legs of certain birds are adapted to their function , the headmaster switched Andrewes to science . Andrewes was so happy the gamesmaster found it necessary to write in his reports : " He would do well to pay more attention to the game and less to the vegetation at the periphery of the field . " The success of this essay led Andrewes to consider a writing career , but his father , Sir Frederick Andrewes , advised him to obtain a medical education first so he would have his bread and // butter . His experiences as a student at St. Bartholomew 's Hospital in London , where his father was a professor , made Andrewes forget about writing . His father had helped document the devastating effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor there was enthusiastic about virus research . Andrewes was attracted to viruses because they were so mysterious and troublesome . After qualifying in medicine , he went to work at the hospital for a researcher who believed he had found a virus that caused cancer . For Andrewes the work meant endless hours waiting at the operating theater to collect samples of tumors from the surgeons . Andrewes eventually decided he was getting nowhere by trying to pursue both clinical medicine and research , so he joined the National Institute for Medical Research in Hampstead , just outside of London . In the laboratory where Andrewes worked , dog distemper was being studied . A highly contagious viral respiratory infection , distemper had been chosen for study in the hope that it might give insight into human respiratory viruses , and dogs had been singled out with the idea that if some relief could be afforded them , it might help rebut the arguments of the antivivisectionists . But the distemper work had run aground almost at the start because so many dogs were immune to the ailment . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus division , " a huntin ' fishin ' shootin ' type " named Captain Douglas , happened to know that on farms and estates ferrets caught distemper from dogs , and had suggested using ferrets for the distemper research instead of dogs . In the laboratory ferrets readily caught distemper . Shortly , toward the end of 1932 , influenza broke out in London . During the course of the epidemic , Andrewes and another worker from the laboratory , Wilson Smith , attended a scientific meeting in London . There they met a professor who happened to remark that the epidemic offered a fine opportunity for some80 THE VIRUS THAT ATE CANNIBALS one to find the agent responsible . The year before the virus of swine influenza had been found by an American , Richard Shope . He had taken pigs ' respiratory secretions , filtered them , and transmitted the disease to other pigs by nasal inoculation . The work was widely discussed because it suggested a way to proceed with the investigation of human influenza . Wilson Smith was as much a pessimist as Andrewes was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to isolate the agent of influenza . He and Andrewes proposed to inoculate rats , mice , rabbits , and guinea pigs with washings from human influenza . Back at Hampstead , as they discussed their plans , Andrewes felt his temperature and pulse rise . Smith washed out Andrewes 's nose and throat , and Andrewes went home to bed ? with the flu . Smith filtered the washings and inoculated the animals , but nothing came of it . Not long after that , the head of the laboratory , P. P. Laidlaw , received a telephone call from another laboratory , where the entire staff was catching the flu . To his surprise , he was told that all their ferrets , which were used for distemper research , were getting influenza too . Laidlaw mentioned this to Smith , who seized the clue . He took Andrewes 's remaining throat washings out of the icebox and inoculated two ferrets that happened to be on hand for distemper studies . Two days later ? the day Andrewes returned to work ? the ferrets began sneezing and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noses paled , their noses became stuffy , they yawned and refused food . To the great delight of Smith and Andrewes , the illness lasted several days , and they thought it looked as though the ferrets had caught the flu . It turned out that the ferrets at the other laboratory did n't have influenza after all , but an unusual form of distemper . Smith and Andrewes 's ferrets soon caught distemper as well , and between the flu and distemper , the two researchers were quite confused . Luck rescued them after Wilson Smith became infected , // apparently from a ferret . Andrewes washed out Smith 's nose and throat , and Smith went home to bed with the flu . Ferrets inoculated with his washings , which they called the VVS strain , also caught the " feverish snuffling disease , " and Smith and Andrewes thought the disease almost certainly was human influenza . To rule out any doubt , Andrewes and Smith established a ferret hospital several miles from the main Hampstead laboratory where the ferrets could be kept in strict isolation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , donned high rubber boots , gauntlet gloves , and raincoats , swabbed themselves thoroughly with Lysol , and waded through a Lysol pool before visiting each pair of ferrets in their isolation cubicles . The precautions helped , but occasional accidental infections still slowed down their work . When the washings were diluted a hundred times , they remained infectious ? and inoculated into more ferrets , they consistently produced the flulike disease . Further evidence that the WS strain was influenza was the way it spread among the animals . Another sneeze helped clinch the case . After a ferret sneezed in the face of a new worker , Charles Stuart-Harris , he came down with the flu . By the summer of 1933 the researchers were certain of their results and announced the news : they had found a virus for human influenza . After that , " things went merrily , " as Andrewes mildly put it . Their isolation of the virus led to the development of an influenza vaccine . The efforts of many went into this vaccine , which was made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the outbreak of the Second World War , there were several experimental vaccines in existence , but fears of another epidemic like that of 1918 ? which had started among troops ? led to the rapid development of a vaccine suitable for large-scale use . This was done by Dr. Thomas Francis of the University of Michigan . After tests in 1942 and 1943 , it was put into use by the mili82 THE VIRUS THAT ATE CANNIBALS tary . There were no major epidemics , and the vaccine was pronounced a great success . During the war Andrewes worked on typhus , which is caused by relatives of free-living bacteria , and in the process he contracted a severe case of the disease . By the time he recovered , three years later , the war was over and typhus was being controlled with insecticide , so Andrewes began casting around for new fields to conquer . After the war , things had stopped going merrily with influenza with the alarming discovery that the virus could transform itself ! This was a potentially insuperable blow , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine-induced antibody ? like a lock ? fits the keylike surface antigens of the invader . The influenza virus had been transformed to such an extent that the vaccine was rendered not just less effective , but utterly useless against the new strain . Similar antigenic changes in the influenza virus had been charted almost simultaneously in distant parts of the world , and Andrewes realized that international collaboration would be necessary to cope with the problem . He suggested to the World Health Organization that a network of influenza surveillance centers be established , and he set up the first one in England . Similar centers were subsequently established around the world for the purpose of isolating and comparing new strains that might surface . In theory at least , this would make it possible to prepare and distribute a vaccine containing the new strains in time to head off a major epidemic . Andrewes believed that this was probably the most that could be done at the time about such devious , changeable viruses , and his thoughts returned to a project he had started years before ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroke while in the United States on business , and Andrewes and his mother had // gone to New York to be with him . While Sir Frederick recuperated , Andrewes visited a researcher at the College of Physicians and Surgeons , Dr. Alphonse Dochez , who was studying colds . By means of filtered nasal washings , Dochez had transmitted colds to humans and chimpanzees , and he believed that what he was transmitting was a virus . Dochez had also attempted to culture the agent in minced chick embryo , with peculiar results . After fifteen subcultures were done under anaerobic conditions ? conditions not likely to keep cells , not to mention a virus , alive ( but this was not then understood ) ? he produced colds in human volunteers , though none in chimpanzees , which are very susceptible to colds . Andrewes thought the work interesting , and when he returned to England he tried to repeat the experiments . Chimpanzees were prohibitively expensive , so he used human volunteers . " We can not get hold of any chimpanzees , " he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the next best thing to a chimpanzee is a Bart 's student . " A hundred students volunteered . Andrewes could not isolate his test subjects as Dochez had isolated his chimps , so he inoculated them in groups of eight or more . To some he administered active filtrates from colds ; others served as controls and received a placebo . The experiment was seemingly a success : the medical students caught colds in numbers comparable to Dochez 's chimpanzees . Andrewes and a collaborator next tried to culture the filtrates , but with the cultured substance not a single student caught a cold . So Dochez came over to see what the problem was , bringing cultures with him . When Dochez and Andrewes tested more students with these cultures , only an insignificant number came down with colds , and Andrewes published a report titled " The Common Cold Wins the First Round . " By 1946 no one had been able to confirm Dochez 's results , and the agent of colds was as much a riddle as ever . Andrewes thought he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was // optimistic that it would not be cracked , like influenza , only to reveal more nuts . Andrewes 's first objective was to establish a reliable method of detecting the presence of a cold virus . Since only humans and chimpanzees were known to catch colds and chimps were too expensive , this meant human volunteers would have to do until a better system was developed . Once he had a dependable method of detecting and transmitting colds , Andrewes intended to hunt for a convenient laboratory animal , isolate the agent , culture it , study it , and perhaps find a preventive or cure . He began to look for a place where human volunteers could be kept in strict isolation . Experimenting with humans outside an institutional setting was a novel idea , and he did not know quite what he was looking for . The Ministry of Health urged him to use a wartime facility Britain had inherited from the Allies : the Harvard Hospital and a large complex of buildings just outside of Salisbury , ninety miles southwest of London . Constructed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facility had been designed as headquarters for epidemiologic teams and an infectious-disease treatment center in the event that epidemics had resulted from crowding in air-raid shelters . The feared epidemics never developed , and the unit was used for a time by the U.S. Army as a medical laboratory for its European forces . Andrewes originally pictured the cold experiments on a modest scale , with a few volunteers involved at a time , but once he began thinking seriously about it , he realized that large numbers of subjects would be needed and that the Salisbury unit would be ideal . The Americans had thought big : the Salisbury unit consisted of twenty-two buildings surrounded by sixteen acres of lush farmland and woods . Some of the structures were in poor condition , and Andrewes had them torn down ; others were altered . He chose to use the oblong huts that had served as hospital staff // quarters to house the volunteers . Each hut , measuring a generous 20 by 140 feet , was divided into two apartments , with a sitting room , bedrooms , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covered walkways were constructed between the buildings to make clinical visits and food delivery easier in bad weather . Andrewes was pleased with the site , finding it pleasantly " airy , " though at times it was too airy , being open to strong winds from the southwest . ( A gale once blew the roof off one of the buildings . ) The terrain was also pleasing , with its partridges , rabbits , and wild orchids , which thrived in the chalky soil . All in all , Andrewes thought the place ought to put the volunteers into an agreeable frame of mind . Besides Andrewes , who became the first director of the Salisbury Common Cold Research Unit , there was a physician , an administrator , a matron to look after the volunteers , a secretary , a cook , a chauffeur-mechanic , and a succession of " girl graduates " who were trained as laboratory technicians , and who , among other duties , accompanied the director on his early morning walks to study the local flora and fauna . Inspiration for the first experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent of atypical pneumonia in eggs , without success . But when the egg substance itself was placed into the noses of hamsters and rats , the researchers achieved their goal . Andrewes decided to apply this approach to colds . First , volunteers were needed , and obtaining them proved to be difficult . In the summer of 1946 , he and other members of the Salisbury staff visited universities , gave lectures , and held press conferences describing the project and appealing for volunteers . It was at one of these press conferences that the unit acquired its famous reputation as " the place for honeymooners . " Andrewes had been explaining that the volunteers would not be totally isolated , but housed in twos , when , as he put it , " a little devil caused me to say , entirely on the spur of the moment : It might suit // honeymoon couples . ' I shall never forget the sight of all those journalists pricking up their ears and then starting to scribble madly on their note pads , " he wrote later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name stuck , and it did not do any harm . The appeals always drew some response , and with experience the staff became more adept at enticing volunteers to spend their vacations in bucolic solitude at Salisbury . Since there were few precedents for human experimentation , Andrewes devised a system as he went along . In return for a tenday stay at the unit , volunteers received free room , board , pocket money , fare to and from Salisbury , and a bottle of beer , cider , or stout each day of their stay . Andrewes wanted only true volunteers ; he did not feel right about experimenting on the retarded or prisoners , and he was grateful for the advantage of dealing with a minor illness , one people were not afraid of catching . Considering those who would serve as controls and those who would be resistant , most of the volunteers could be assured of not even catching a cold . Many of the volunteers were students ; there were also teachers , nurses , homemakers , miners , civil servants , gardeners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer for a stay at Salisbury . Foreigners also volunteered , mainly from Holland , Scandinavia , the United States , and Australia . All that was required of the volunteers was that they be between eighteen and fifty years of age , not pregnant , and not suffering from a cold or other infection . Once a burglar came ( only once , Andrewes said ) , and once a man who said he had been called a sex maniac but that it was untrue . ( He was disqualified . ) Now and then there were difficulties , in remarkable variety , with the volunteers , as one of the physicians , Dr. A. T. Roden , complained : Ten little volunteers On the Salisbury line . One of them rode through to Bath Then there were nine . // Nine little volunteers Coming through the gate . One of them had second thoughts And then there were eight . Eight little volunteers Made the number even . One of them looked very odd Then there were seven . Seven little volunteers Up to monkey tricks . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six little volunteers Hoping to survive . An X-ray shadow settled one Then there were five . Five little volunteers Peeping round the door . One had a nasty cold .. Andrewes enjoyed the volunteers ; he had never cared for the ferrets , which bit and had to be grasped tightly by the neck before being picked up . Most of the volunteers cooperated , and some returned many times . By 1970 , more than 17,000 had visited the unit . If the rest of his scheme had unfolded half as smoothly , Andrewes would have rejoiced . On arrival the volunteers met , were given lunch , a pep talk , and a physical examination . Once an experiment began they were rigorously isolated : the matron and physician wore sterile masks and gowns when visiting them , and they were not permitted to go into town , ride in cars or buses , go within thirty feet of others , or talk with anyone they might accidentally meet . When hot meals were delivered to their rooms , they had to wait a few // minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation . Each apartment was equipped with a radio and telephone , newspapers were delivered each morning , and volunteers were free to roam the countryside . If they played badminton , volleyball , bumblepuppy , or any of the other games provided , they could play only with their living-quarters partner ; afterward , they opened the windows and cleaned the equipment with disinfectant , and the next pair to use the room had to wait an hour before entering . After several days of isolation , when the physician was certain that none of the volunteers had colds , inoculations were given . All the tests were double-blind : some of the volunteers received cold viruses , others a harmless saline solution , and neither physician nor subjects knew which until the results were tabulated . A virologist in the laboratory coded the information . If the controls came down with colds , all the results of that experiment were discarded . On daily rounds the doctor inquired about sneezing , watery eyes , stuffy nose , aches , sore throats , cough , headache , malaise , chills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cold symptoms . Each symptom was scored from zero to nine and the number of points totaled . Five types of colds were defined , ranging from abortive ( slight respiratory symptoms that are gone in twenty-four hours ) to severe ( requiring bed rest and accompanied by shivering , aches , fever , and more serious respiratory symptoms ) . Some of the volunteers , as if they thought it was expected , provided elaborate , exaggerated reports of their symptoms , while others insisted they felt splendid , even as they coughed and sniffled and shivered . This difference was taken into account . A good index to a cold , Andrewes perceived early on , was the number of tissues used by a volunteer . The tissues were saved and counted both before and after inoculation , and the ways different people used a tissue was also taken into account : some // blew their noses once , folded it neatly , and threw it away ; others used a tissue until it was wet and shredded . " All this may sound rather unscientific , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he soon attained his first objective : a dependable method of transmitting colds . Using a boundless supply of cold viruses from the boys at Harrow School and Salisbury workers , the staff inoculated volunteers and found that they could reliably produce colds in thirty-five to forty percent of cases . This , in turn , provided a means of determining whether they had found a culture technique that worked . They had not . They first tried cultivating the agent in hens ' eggs , the technique that worked with influenza , herpes , and other viruses . Nasal washings from cold sufferers were injected into the membrane , yolk sac , amniotic sac , and other parts of the chick embryo ? all with negative results . When the " cultured " viruses were inoculated into volunteers , they did not catch colds . Reports came from the United States that a cold virus cultured in eggs had produced colds in volunteers . So Andrewes visited one of these laboratories , in Baltimore , and returned home with some of their culture viruses . " Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with colds , " in Salisbury they produced no colds at all . " More culture fluid was sent over from the United States , but it did n't produce colds the second time either . Then the Baltimore researcher brought some over himself , and under his supervision it caused colds . After he left , Andrewes and the staff repeated the experiment ? with no results . They were stymied . Andrewes concluded that the volunteers used in the Baltimore studies , who were prisoners , probably told the doctors whatever they wanted to hear . Other laboratories also failed to reproduce the Baltimore results . Such work continued for years at Salisbury . It was tedious and amounted only to disproving the claims of others . The hunt for a convenient laboratory animal susceptible to
