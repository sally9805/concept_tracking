In perfumery , form - in this case size - does not follow function . If it did , this small coterie of the most accomplished nostrils on earth would need wheelbarrows to shuffle their schnozzolas to and from the office. // But they don ' t . A highly trained nose is not necessarily large . And to teach it the 4 , 400-smell vocabulary of the modern perfumer doesn ' t take a whip and chair - just about a decade or more . That ' s about average to make it at the largest developer of fragrances in the world , International Flavors and Fragrances ( IFF ) . // By that time , a perfumer has learned the company ' s different fragrances and how they interact : the diffusive , spicy musk odor with strong floral reinforcement of Cashmeran , for instance ; or the intense , balsamic herbal note of hyacinth in Benzacetex . He has become close friends with the bergamot and the rose-like character of Citronellyl acetate with its green , leafy undertone of plums and litchis . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citronama ; the celery odor that reminds one of maple and foenngreek in Celeriax. // If his ' ' nose ' ' proves up to snuff , a perfumer will earn his way to a carpeted , wood-paneled , objets d ' art-adorned office on the sixth floor of the company ' s offices here . Perhaps right next to the world ' s most famous ' ' nose , ' ' Frenchman Bernard Chant , or one of the other 55 perfumers IFF retains worldwide . Their sense about scents have brought IFF the sweetest smell of success in a $2 billion-a-year perfume industry . With the lion ' s share of the approximately 500 fragrances on the world market , IFF has kept a nose ahead of the competition - such firms as Givaudan and Firmenich in Switzerland , Roure-Bertrand duPont in France , Takasago in Japan , and Naarden in Holland. // In doing so , IFF has produced dozens of the most famous fragrances in the world . Avon credits them with most of its colognes , after shaves , and perfumes . Colgate credits IFF with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer Halston has come out to say he worked for two years with Mr. Chant to create his $65-an-ounce perfume , the rest of the names are top secret . ' ' We ' re ghostwriters , ' ' says Chant. // But you see IFF fragrances at every perfume counter from here to Paris , from the cheapest to most expensive . After shaves , colognes , perfumes , and eau de everything from jasmine and rose to lavender and bay rum . You can smell them from scent bottles , atomizers , sachets , scent bags , and pouncet boxes. // Few large cosmetic firms and designers hire their own perfumers , mostly because so few exist , according to Annette Green , executive director of the Fragrance Foundation , a non-profit educational organization that disseminates information about fragrances . ' ' It ' s like a composer of music , ' ' she says . ' ' There are only so many great composers , and there are only so many great perfumers. ' ' // And if you could open the black vault kept behind iron bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , you could find which of the world ' s famous perfume houses have their scents created here . Perhaps more important , you could find out just what combinations of man-made and natural compounds and subcompounds go into them. // Of course , words do not a Hemingway make , nor colors a Monet . Nor smells a Bernard Chant . That takes integrity of thought , dedication of purpose , discipline of execution . And vision. // Bernard Chant is perhaps the best known of some 350 perfumers around the globe . His grandparents lived in Grasse , the capital of the French perfume industry , and he studied chemistry at the Sorbonne . He has been with IFF since 1954 , and he supervises IFF ' s other perfumers . It was Chant that created IFF ' s more famous and lucrative scents . Just beyond the black vault is his personal bailiwick , where he goes daily to concoct new creations. // This is not necessarily where the fragrance is composed . The conception , vision , revelation , or creation of a scent can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Alps , or swimming off the Great Barrier Reef , says Chant . Mozart composed while riding in a carriage to Maria Theresa in Schonbrunn Palace . Beethoven shut himself in his flat in Vienna . Bernard Chant is at work around the clock. // When he arrives at his office , the surroundings must be conducive to evolving the final product . Hence the quiet , the solitude , the original art - even music . The office is not bedecked with shelf after shelf of amber bottles , computer micro-scales , beakers , test tubes . That ' s all in an adjacent room , connected to his office by a small , secretive-looking pass-through. // Chant scribbles his compositions on formula paper , hands it through the pass-through , shuts the sliding door , and waits. // On the other side , aspiring Chantses concoct the formula . It may take some time ; many involve over 800 different ingredients. // Chant says , when a designer asks him to create a fragrance , he tries to get as much information as possible on the designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style of clothes he designs and any fragrances he may have already marketed . As for the ups and downs of scentmaking , Chant says : ' ' Trends are existing scents . If the public likes woody fragrances , what can we do to continue the woody ? A fragrance is a combination of the familiar and the new . You look at the market all the time to keep a pulse on it and to see where you can go . It ' s not to copy , but to step ahead. ' ' // Fortunately , many of the 4 , 400 separate scents exist in compounds . Since one compound may include 800 original scents , the lab technician and perfumer don ' t have to start the creating task with 4 , 400 amber bottles in front of them. // The white-coated lab technicians use eye droppers and sophisticated measuring devices to mix the formula . It is weighed on a scale accurate to 1/100th of a gram . A slight mistake could mean a transfer back to the mail room or soap division. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses one-quarter-inch wide , 51/2-inch-long paper blotters , calibrated in red to keep track of each stage of a fragrance ' s birth . He or she may add here or subtract there until the creation reaches the model in mind . The calibrations aid the perfumer in determining how much of a given fragrance he is smelling . Since each fragrance is composed of many ' ' notes ' ' - some of which strike the nostrils immediately , others of which don ' t appear until time has elapsed - he or she may be working on hundreds at once. // The ultimate product will go to the customer who ordered it - or at least to the one who bought it , since some fragrances are rejected and thus sold to other clients . IFF will own the formula and produce it at its New Jersey plant . And Bernard Chant will begin ghostwriting another fragrance . His salary this year will be $230 , 000 - not including half again as much in possible bonuses. // Of course , perfume isn ' t the only thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious items : soaps , shampoos , floor cleaners and waxes , polishes , body creams , foot powders , and deodorants. // But IFF also perfumes everything from garbage to shower curtains , from raincoats to tissues and artificial logs . One New Jersey garbage plant used IFF-developed perfume oil and alcohol spray in their air-conditioning ducts to keep citizens for miles around from holding their noses . And if you knew what your shower curtain really smelled like , says an IFF official , you ' d never buy it. // Breakthroughs in fragrance are being made in other consumer items , such as shopping bags and toys . A ' ' Strawberry Shortcake ' ' doll and teddy bears that smell like chocolate or cotton candy already exist . Buying a used car ? It ' s likely to have a leather smell or even a new-car smell sprayed in the interior . Such things as hair-removing cream , which used to smell like a burning sewage plant , now smell nice . And who makes Hawaiian tanning lotion smell like coconut ? IFF. // A florist wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , not for smell . One deli owner had IFF develop a baked-ham aerosol ; another a hot-dog and sauerkraut smell . One marine museum curator had the company develop a salty sea-air scent with seaweed . Another museum owner wanted a 19th-century farmyard and schoolhouse scent . IFF did the research and produced them all. // The labs on IFF ' s nine other floors deal with experiments in these areas . Since practically the whole building smells pungently of perfume , ' ' noseweary ' ' evaluators have to enter booths of pure , filtered air to make final assessments. // In one room , filled with washers and dryers , evaluators remove laundry from the machines and immediately retreat to the closed booths . This allows them to make uncontaminated appraisals of fabric softeners , detergents , bleaches , and so forth. // Of course , every fragrance must be evaluated in the base from which it will eventually emerge as a product - soap bar , kitchen cleanser . Van Vechten Sayre , IFF ' s advertising manager , points out that no matter how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consumers won ' t buy it if it smells bad. // Thus there is great competition in the industry for attractive fragrances , ranging from those added to Janitor in a Drum to Pine-Sol and Lestoil . It is difficult to add delicate fragrances such as jasmine or hyacinths to cleaners , says Sayre , because the potent chemicals in the solvents break them down. // When the appropriate fragrance has been added to a product , it is sent to a paneled , carpeted conference room - the OEB , or Odor Evaluation Board . If OEB doesn ' t hold its nose in the air , it ' s off to the customer. // On the ninth floor , the whole process starts over again with the additional and closely related sense of taste . There are 2 , 000 raw materials going into artificially flavored products , says Mr. Sayre - some of which are safer than their natural counterpart . One example is a flavorant used for fruit flavors , primarily cherry and almond , known as benzaldehyde . Natural benzaldehyde , made from almond kernels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benzaldehyde contains none . Charles Wiener , chief flavorist , says : ' ' We leave out those dangerous things found in nature . The question isn ' t whether a product is natural or synthetic , but whether it ' s safe , ' ' he says. // The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms Bureau , and the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) regulate taste and smell companies in the United States. // Strawberries have 350 essential oils , called volatile substances , that give them odor and taste . The FDA says nothing can be added to a strawberry flavor that is not one of these volatile substances . But for IFF , the formulas will result from the different environments the substance will go through - heating , freezing , cooking - that might alter its makeup . The chemicals required would be different , for instance , depending on whether they are used in popsicles , cakes , or frostings. // As with flowers , IFF devises flavor intensifiers for everything from carrots and peas to authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some customers have asked for formulas that put flavors back into prepackaged heat-and-serve foods and fast-food hamburgers  --  or taco flavor for tortilla chips. // When Algerian babies refused to be weaned on a UNICEF protein drink , IFF came to the rescue . Their additive  --  with just a of hint onion  --  imitated the milk with which their mothers had suckled them. // One of the bigges IFF growing areas is analogues  --  100 percent vegetable protein flavored into real-tasting sausages , bacon , tuna , or chicken . They are made from soy beans . One economist has commented that they may yet solve the world food shortage . And they have been popular with people who don ' t eat meat. // One of the major concerns among customers of all chemical-related firms is safety . IFF has gotten into hot water with Schering-Plough to the tune of a $10 million lawsuit . The company says the coconut-banana fragrance IFF developed for a sunscreen version of Coppertone caused blotches on sunbathers ' skin during market tests. // IFF says that at the time it created the fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards. // Last year IFF spent over $20 million on research and development , employing over 600 employees in 22 labs around the world . Two-thirds of its sales are overseas . With earnings in foreign currencies , much can be lost when exchanged into dollars . The worldwide recession has taken its toll on sales . Sales grew only 1 percent to reach $451 million in 1981 . Earnings grew only 5 percent to $66 million . That compares to an average growth rate of 15 percent a year in the 1970s . " Immediate problems aside , " says Fortune magazine , which recently spent two months scrutinizing every phase of the company operation and its place in the industry , " IFF is one of the few healthy flowers in the garden.
