Robert Grayson no longer constantly relives that night of horror in his mind , the night his life was altered by a savage beating on a desolate stretch of highway . Yet its anguish never fully recedes into the past . Five years ago , Grayson was driving home from work in suburban New Jersey at 2 a.m. when he saw a car on the road apron , its driver slumped over the wheel . He stopped to offer help . To his shock , the driver , and three others who emerged from the dark , all with records for random assault , threatened to kill him and dump his body in the bushes . They nearly did . " They held me and hit me over and over , once with a rock or pole or something in the back of my head , " Grayson , a stocky man , recalled recently in a New York restaurant . One eye darted as he spoke while the other stared straight ahead . " They stomped me with heavy boots , at one point even threw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a passerby , but his ordeal had only begun . Blinded in one eye , suffering from nerve damage , headaches , and frequent pain , he missed work for most of a year . He became depressed , bewildered enough , he says , to watch wrestling and John Wayne movies on television " just to see good triumph over evil , even if I knew it was phony . " He was even embarrassed to tell some people he had been beaten up for fear that it would " somehow reflect on my manhood . " During that time the assailants , arrested near the scene , were tried and got off on lesser charges with probation or a light sentence . The jury never even learned of Grayson ' s partial blindness . The trial , says Grayson , " was more traumatic than the crime itself . The court just ignored me . I was disgusted and let down . " Now 29 and enjoying a new career as a crime victim advocate , Grayson has recovered much of his zest for life . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , he is troubled that he can find no motivation for it . " I ' ll always be bothered by the question of why , " he says now . " Some days , I feel okay . But other days , like when I mess up shavingbecause I can ' t see the right side of my face , or when my balance is off , it hurts to know that my suffering meant nothing to these guys . They probably wouldn ' t know me if they passed me on the street , because it was just a night of drunken hijinks for them . It hurts to know that they all got off lightly while I got a lifetime sentence of pain . " The victim of violent crime can take a brief journey into the heart of darkness . It exposes something dark and chaotic in human nature : the need to control , subdue , vanquish another person . Such crime violates our social contract ; it can poison our dreams . No one is prepared . Not for the immediate impact - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disruption of work , the frustration caused by a criminal justice system fine- tuned in recent years to the rights of the offender , yet indifferent , at best , to the lot of the victim . And no one is prepared for the emotional aftermath - the anger and humiliation , the feeling of powerlessness , the dislocation of one ' s sense of a just world . We cling to the notion that it can ' t happen to us . Yet the number of crime victims increases . In 1979 , it swelled by 12.1 million Americans , according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ' s record of reported crimes . Law enforcement experts agree that the actual number is closer to 40 million , not including family members . Anyone ' s odds of becoming the victim of a serious crime grew by 9 percent , of a violent crime , by 11 percent . Preliminary figures show a similar rise in crime last year . Although their plight has recently been discovered by legal and social service professionals , crime victims remain largely ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more generous to the victims , collectively , of a natural catastrophe or a plane crash than we are to the millions of individual lives twisted by crime . This is partly understandable : It is easier , though no more rational , to take pity on the victims of an " act of God . " Criminal acts produce more revulsion than sympathy . While twenty-eight states now offer compensation for expenses related to the physical injuries of crime victims , most of these efforts are so underfunded and inadequately administered that they aid only a tiny fraction of those eligible . And while making monetary awards may be a questionable , and necessarily arbitrary , response to the problem , the FBI nonetheless estimates the cost of violent crime - in medical expenses , lost earnings , and in property loss - in the billions . Around $50 million is awarded annually to crime victims . Victim services in general get less than 2 percent of what the federal government spends to rehabilitate offenders . Such neglect was not always the case in earlier societies . Justice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe followed the rules of Hammurabi ' s Code , a means to redress the victim . Crime was , in essence , a private affair between aggressor and aggrieved . Restitution - or blood vengeance - was not only tolerated , it was the purpose . With the rise of royal power in England around the twelfth century , the state began to take away from individuals the right to exact compensation and to punish . Crime came increasingly to be seen as a " breach of the king ' s peace . " As the king ' s courts took more responsibility to locate blame and access punishment , criminal justice procedures began to focus more on the accused . Safeguards to prevent the state from arbitrarily convicting the innocent or too harshly punishing the guilty then began to evolve over centuries of reform . Now the moral basis of our legal system , these re- forms , from the abolition of whipping posts to Miranda warnings , flow from the notion that it is more grevious for the state to wrong the innocent than for a single individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process , however , argue advocates of victims ' rights , is that the victim was forgotten . " The offender commits his crime against society , " said Robert O. Dawson , a professor of criminal law at the University of Texas . " He comes out of prison and says , " I ' ve paid my debt to society , ' and the victim is standing there saying , " What about me ? Nobody ' s paid any debt to me . ' I think that is as important as determining guilt or innocence . " Dawson ' s notion that courts somehow need to be more accountable to the crime victim worries legal experts , who contend that the only job of judges is to ensure that trials are held in accordance to law . They would place the obligation to assist crime victims with the government . Others object to the idea that it is the public ' s responsibility to pay individuals for damages caused by crime . And efforts to show more compassion to victims have at times been tarnished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the extreme right . Vigilantes - and in general those who believe that the Supreme Court " went too far " to protect defendants ' rights in the 1960s - are today among the loudest critics that our courts coddle criminals while ignoring victims . Despite such criticism , recognition of the crime victim ' s anguish has been growing in recent years - along with efforts to help . A small federal grant five years ago helped set up the first efforts to ease the anxiety , inconvenience , and frustration of crime victims and witnesses of crimes who press charges or testify in court . Prosecutors in about three hundred and fifty counties around the country - including nine in Massachusetts - now have Victim/Witness Assistance projects that try to make the judicial maze a little less forbidding to victims . And to reach the vast majority of crime victims who never press charges , many cities are also beginning to offer several services to victims outside the courthouse , as New York has long done . Judges are also becoming more sensitive to crime victims ; many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison in some cases . " We still don ' t fully appreciate the crime victim ' s problems , " said Lucy Friedman , the head of one of the country ' s largest and most progressive aid programs , the Victim Services Agency of New York . " But the victim is increasingly sensing that there is somebody in the courts who cares about what happened to them and will help . " She described her agency ' s efforts as " trying to fill a void " in the American legal system . Victims of a personal crime differ from victims of automobile accidents or hurricanes in one important respect : Their suffering was inflicted by another person intentionally . While that fact may serve as a rationale to excuse our neglect - after all , the criminal ' s to blame , right ? - it is the knowledge of it that tends to worsen the crime victim ' s misery . " It ' s not just harmed that the victim of a crime feels , but willfully violated by someone else , " says Mort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York who has written extensively on victims ' responses . " That ' s the very nature of victimization , what makes it so brutal . " Psychologists believe that personal violation may be as important to some criminals as the gold chain or the wallet - and may explain much of the excessive violence that accompanies crime . " A robber attacks his victim ' s ego , " he said . " It could even be his real goal , to try and degrade somewone else . " The victims ' emotional response to the sudden theft of their self- control can be intense . A young woman was raped not long ago in the elevator of an office building in downtown Boston . Her coworkers , breaking up a meeting , had watched a suspicious man harass her as she stood in the elevator . By the time they got near her , the elevator doors had hissed shut . The rape suspect was arrested , but a trial had to be postponed . " The woman was under so much stress that she literally blocked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of Boston ' s Victim/ Witness Assistance Project at the Suffolk County Courthouse . " Both her parents had died within the previous year and she was left caring for herself and a terminally ill aunt . Things were so bad for her that she made herself forget the rape . It was too painful to deal with . " Kelly has since been working with the woman to help her recover emotionally and to assist her in prosecuting the case . Many crime victims respond with rage . A retired antiques dealer in Brooklyn was mugged recently by a young man who knocked him down and tore off his glasses and hearing aid . It was the twelfth time that Vito Gerard , now 70 , has been mugged in the last ten years - all in the same neighborhood , where he has lived for thirty years . Despite that , he defiantly goes out every night to buy an early edition of the next day ' s Daily News . " Crimes like that have made most older people like me afraid to set their foot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center run by the Victim Services Agency . " But goddammit , I ' m not going to be cooped up because of that bum . " Gerard was at the center only hours after the incident to press charges against the suspected assailant . A small but powerfully built man , veins bulged in his leathery neck as he spoke . " I ' m mad enough this time to testify . I want to see that SOB get sent away for as much time as he can get . Why the hell should we older people let parasites like that kid ruin our last years ? I tell you , if he gets off light I ' m not coming back here again . I ' ll just carry a knife or pipe or something . If I get the chance , maybe next time I ' ll kill one of these muggers . " Agreat many crime victims try to cover up their hurt in silence . " The emotional trauma can be damaging , " said Marlene Rifai , the chairman of the National Organization of Victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers training assistance to , victim assistance efforts . " Victims of serious personal crimes may go through a lot of stress - gaining or losing weight , suffering marital problems , or finding themselves unable to concentrate at work . " Recent research indicates that , after rape victims , the families of murder victims suffer the most from crime . Bard , who is studying the response of Harlem families to the murder of an immediate member , said that only now are social services actively recognizing that the victim of a homicide " isn ' t just the body in the morgue . " Whole families , he says , often disintegrate rather than pull through the crisis . On the day after Christmas two years ago , Polly Reyes was sexually assaulted on a street in Manhattan ' s Spanish Harlem . She had sensed a man following her home from the subway , she recalled recently , shadowing her intentionally erratic course . After he lunged at her - kissing her and tearing at her clothes - she managed to break away and run , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " After the initial shock and anger , " said the 29-year-old , crimson-haired woman , an administrator in a city juvenile justice agency , " I just closed up . My brother had to move in with me . I wouldn ' t go out alone , and I avoided men like the plague . I also began taking dozens of baths to try and wash off the feel of his hands on my body , a horrible dirty feeling I couldn ' t get rid of . " Reyes was later haunted by the inexplicability of the assault . And , like many crime victims who demand a logic for their suffering , she began to direct the blame against herself . " One thing that really bothered me was that I couldn ' t figure out why he picked me out , " she said . " Of all the women on that subway , why me ? I ' m not that flashy a dresser . I began to wonder what I could have done to attract him , how it could have been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street in my neighborhood after the attack - everybody , of course , knew about it - I felt them looking at me and thinking I had somehow caused it . It really upset me . I wanted to go up to people and say , " Hey , I didn ' t do anything . I ' m innocent . " Victims of violent crime need to regain a sense of personal integrity and control , to renew their self-esteem . New York ' s Victim Services Agency tries to aid that process indirectly by helping crime victims deal with certain practical needs - getting shattered eyeglasses repaired , obtaining a court order of protection for a battered woman , locating a stolen car , finding proper medical or financial help . The agency ' s combination of approaches to victim assistance have made it a national model in the field . The result of a pilot project to aid crime victims in Brooklyn five years ago , it is now an independent mayoral agency with one hundred fifty employees , two dozen professional counselors , and a budget of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants and the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration . At four criminal and three family courthouses around the city , its centers try to make the legal process a little less intimidating to victims and witnesses . In addition to representing the wishes to the prosecutor , the agency notifies victims and witnesses when they are needed in court , thereby freeing them from unnecessary waiting . To make court appearances easier , it provides services from day care to transportation . Since apparently only one fifth of crime victims press charges , the Victim Services Agency also has units at some police precincts , runs four neighborhood centers , and works with various community agencies . Police called to the scene of domestic violence , for example , may put the participants in touch with neighborhood VSA workers . Quick information or advice is available to crime victims through its twenty-four hour " crime hotline . " Each month the agency installs or repairs locks for about one thousand elderly residents . Special long-term psychological counseling is given to those for whom a sympathetic ear is not enough , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of homicide victims at home . And it gives victims with special needs help with the city ' s maze of social services . Still , not all needs are being met . Robert Grayson argues that a person should not have to clean up after a murder in his own house . " It ' s not something you want to think about , but getting blood off walls or a rug or wiping off the cops ' fingerprint powder is an appalling job for the survivors . Certain grief rituals can have a therapeutic value , but not mopping up blood . " At Grayson ' s prodding , the New Jersey legislature is considering a bill providing such a service . The neglect and official insensitivity that crime victims often experience in the criminal justice system , however , continue to be the focus of the agency and others similar to it around the country . It is an insensitivity that often begins on ground level , with the police . Psychologists believe that the victim ' s first encounter with authorities after a crime is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent order and moral authority to the crime victim , " said Dr. Martin Symonds , a psychoanalyst and former police officer who has long been recognized for his research in victimization . " It ' s a chance to administer psychological first aid to the victim ' s feeling of powerlessness and loss . " Instead , he notes , police - as well as court and hospital personnel - are often so brusque and indifferent as to cause a " second injury . " Mort Bard , also a former police officer , agrees that police are often more callous than necessary . " When dealing with the public , it ' s always got to be the Humphrey Bogart act , " he said . " And the argument that police develop too much scar tissue to show any compassion is nonsense . A cop can learn like anyone else when to be appropriately tough and when to be appropriately sensitive . " Using that early encounter with officialdom to undo some of the crime victim ' s emotional strain is a principal goal of the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explain legal options , interviewers at the court try to treat victims with a measure of respect - and encourage them to blow off some steam , if necessary . The Victim Services Agency ' s two-year-old reception center in the massive , fifty-year-old Brooklyn Criminal Courthouse is bright and comfortable in the slightly plastic manner of a new chain store . About two dozen crime victims sit drinking coffee , reading magazines , or watching the clock as they await an interviewer or some turn in the legal process . An air of apprehension , as in a hospital waiting room , envelops the center , but its carpeted floor , comfortable chairs , and adequate lighting amount to a refugefrom the austere gloominess of the courthouse . A young woman , who asked to be called only Velma , stepped firmly into a small interview room when her name was called and lit a cigarette . A teacher at a downtown Brooklyn school for the emotionally disturbed , Velma seemed sure of herself as she told the counselor of being robbed of three gold chains the previous week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . " I want to prosecute , " she said in a firm , declarative voice . " All the way , simple as that . I ' m not really sure what has to be done , but I want to go to the limit . " Candy Ellington , the counselor , encouraged her to talk about what happened . As the teacher answered , rage began building in her voice and her eyes flashed around the room . " I mean , right at work this happened . Sitting at my desk like you are right now . That ' s what really took me out . You don ' t even have to be on the street anymore to get robbed . " Underneath her coolness , though , Velma said she was anxious and afraid : anxious about not knowing what would happen in court , about having to testify ; afraid for her safety . " I haven ' t been able to eat since it happened , " she said . " And I don ' t even feel safe in my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what her choices were , adding that it could take time . But she said the agency would advise the prosecutor of her wishes - including that her name not be said aloud in court - and would notify her about all court appearances . She went over some additional services , from setting up restitution to child care , then advised the teacher that she could make an appointment to talk further with her or other counselors . While such encounters do help the crime victim , it is also true that they help the prosecutor , who , after all , is anxious to keep the victim not only happy but talking , identifying , and testifying . This - along with the fact that ignoring crime victims was sabotaging their cases - was what helped attract prosecutors to these programs . The federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration has spent about $50 million to set up three-hundred fifty victim/ witness assistance project and still funds about half of these . Its demise , set for March , will require more states and county prosecutors to take over funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim projects to prosecutors , defense attorneys tend to regard such programs with suspicion . In Massachusetts , for example , some district attorneys have instructed members of their victim-witness assistance units not to keep notes of their interviews with crime victims because these were being increasingly subpoeaned by the defense . How victim aid can benefit the prosecution was shown in another recent Boston sex crime - the rape of a 9-year-old girl by her stepfather . The prosecutor had wanted to use the girl ' s testimony at a pretrial hearing , but she was too traumatized even to answer his questions . A crime victim counselor took the girl into a side room to " play with crayons and paper " - and draw out her feelings . The girl drew her room , herself in pajamas in bed , then her stepfather " lying down " on her bed , graphically illustrating the rape . " She even put tears on her face , " the counselor said of the drawing that proved a dramatic Crayola exhibit for the prosecution If there is widespread agreement that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not at all clear just how far the courts should go to provide it . The more ardent proponents of victims ' rights believe our courts are " preoccupied with the offender " yet treat victims shoddily . To protect crime victims from undue harassment , Rice University sociologist Robert Reiff even proposes ( in his recent book , The Invisible Victim ) that restrictions ought to be placed on the defense ' s cross-examination . He also suggests that the victim be given a legal advocate in court , a practice followed in Europe . Less radical ways of bringing victims more into the court process include the growing use of restitution as a sentencing alternative . An advocate of this approach , Judge Lois G. Forer of Philadelphia , argues that letting convicted criminals pay their victims out of earnings from a job may be more constructive than sending them to prison , in some cases - and certainly more satisfactory to the victim . New Jersey took such a stance last month in what is believed to be the first murder case in the country in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state parole board , updating the primitive idea of a blood debt , ordered that a man convicted in 1963 of murdering two policemen could be paroled if a county court would fix terms for restitution to the victims ' families . But the judge has refused to follow the board ' s order , arguing that fixing an amount of money as restitution for loss of life is beyond his " or any other human being ' s ability . " Many legal scholars reject the view that victims should occupy a more important place in the criminal justice system and argue that victims ' rights advocates want to change the basic adversarial nature of our legal system . And defense attorneys - in whose interest it is for complainants and witnesses to shirk testifying or give up in frustration - naturally regard efforts to involve victims as an unwarranted intrusion into the trial process . Given the inclination of judges and appellate courts to uphold criminal convictions under such arcane logic as the " doctrine of harmless error " ( the theory that an unintended and innocuous prosecution blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more often the poor defendant who is victimized by the system . " The notion that criminal procedures are biased toward the defendant is nonsense , " said Graham Hughes , a respected law professor at New York University and British-born barrister who has written extensively about American criminal justice . " Such a statement makes most members of thecriminal defense bar rub their eyes in disbelief . In the plea-bargaining that has virtually replaced trials in many courts , the judge and prosecutor would more often seem hooked into a close alliance to deprive the defendant of his constitutional rights than the other way around . " Hughes agrees that courts should be more " gentle and sympathetic " to crime victims , but he doesn ' t think that restitution should be a basic goal in sentencing . " Compensation for the victim can only be a bonus or by-product of the judicial process , " he said in an interview in New York . " It shouldn ' t overwhelm the court ' s more primary role to protect society and punish as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone and get away with paying $25 per week for X number of years , then we ' re in trouble . " He also argues that society ' s duty to aid crime victims belongs less to the courts than to the executive branch of government - as part of its " social insurance " obligation to people in acute need . Still , crime victims have ample reason for their rage toward the criminal justice system . In scores of courthouses around the country , for example , they must await court appearances in the same rooms as the family and friends of the accused . This hardly allays their often strong dislike - or fear - of testifying . And despite the fact that most people have little or no familiarity with how courts work , few courthouses provide such small but useful amenities as information booths . Victims often arrive in court with images of the legal process based on Perry Mason and defendants who sob and confess on the stand , according to Greg King , director of the Victim Services Agency ' s court operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shuttled around in cavernous buildings , " feeling confused and ignored . " It is small wonder then that , despite the best efforts of late to demystify the judicial process for crime victims and attend to their needs , many complainants and witnesses wind up walking out of courthouses . This may occur from genuine frustration , as their cases wend their way through overburdened calendars , or from lack of will . Others , angered by what they see as excessive leniency toward criminals , simply feel that there is no justice . " A discouraging number of crime victims become convinced that crime pays , " said Nancy Fisher , the director of the Brooklyn court reception center . " They say , " For a slap on the wrist I went through all this grief ? Next time , I ' ll take the law into my own hands . ' We can give them all the assistance we ' re able to , but justice is beyond our realm . " But however well or poorly victims fare in seeking justice , their response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the courthouse . It can inhibit their activities , change the pattern of their lives . For some , it is a small thing - avoiding suspicious streets or a walk in the park , answering strangers through a crack in the door . For others , it is more . A fifth of all burglary victims , one national survey found , move to new addresses within a year . Half of all married women who are raped become divorced . For Polly Reyes , it has meant a fear to go some places or do some things alone , discomfort at disrobing even in front of doctors . And discovering that the unwanted memory is always there . " The other night I dreamed I was explaining to carpenters and workmen in a new office I had designed that they had put a wall up in the wrong place , " she said recently . " I went behind the wall to show them that it shouldn ' t have been there and there was the man - I ' ll never forget those eyes - and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had dreamed about him again . Was I still afraid ? What did it mean ? Maybe something that happened that day had reminded me , I don ' t know . It ' s just something you can ' t wipe away . " SIDEBAR Victim assistance in Massachusetts Crime victims in Massachusetts can get help from Victim/Witness Assistance projects in nine of the state ' s eleven district attorneys ' offices . Lawrence also has a " demonstration program " that involves the police department and local agencies as well as the court . A variety of special services , from temporary shelter to long- term counseling , are available to victims of rape , sexual assault , and spouse abuse in most Massachusetts cities . The state also has a federally funded Statewide Victim Assistance Network to link its crime victim programs to other social agencies . Injured crime victims may obtain financial compensation for medical expenses or loss of earnings under the state ' s Victims of Violent Crime Compensation Act . The state attorney general ' s office administers the program . " Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or progressive approach as the victim assistance program in New York , which is sort of the Cadillac model in the field , " says Karen A. McLaughlin , the former director of court-based victim assistance projects in Worcester and Lawrence . " But what we do have is appropriate to our population and our crime problems . And with the networking approach and the general sophistication of social services in Massachusetts , there is actually a lot of help available for victims of crime here . " Rosemary Kelly , director of Boston ' s Victim/Witness Assistance Project at the Suffolk County Courthouse , says that " about 75 percent of our job is explaining how the court works and helping people be unintimidated by it . It ' s amazing how genuinely afraid of revenge a lot of people are if they have to testify . " The office assists victims or witnesses in any of the nine county courthouses . It relays their requests to the prosecution , notifies them of approaching court dates and even helps arrange transportation to the courthouse . Means to obtain compensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels are also available to victims of less serious crime . About one thousand crime victims come through the Boston project every month . " With only five on our staff , we have our hands full with just the ones who make it to court , " said Kelly . " But we ' re certainly not dealing with all who need help . " Still , the lot of the crime victim , she believes , is better than it was . " Many are surprised to get a phone call from us advising them of a court date or a change in their case , " she said . " I guess they were expecting a police officer to show up with a court summons the night before . " - R.H. B07961277
