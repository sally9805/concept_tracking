For many parents , dinnertime is too often a series of exhausting skirmishes with small children who refuse to finish their spinach or salad . Invariably , the parental argument is : " Eat it . It 's good for you . " This week a new study charges that all too often what is on the plate or in the glass may not be good for you at all . In fact , reports the National Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , an environmental group based in New York City , farm produce sold in U.S. supermarkets and greengroceries may contain so much pesticide that it poses a serious hazard to the health of the nation 's 22 million preschoolers . <P> The study , titled " Intolerable Risk : Pesticides in Our Children 's Food , " examines recent federal data on the eating habits of infants and youngsters through age five , along with figures on the amount of pesticides in 27 different crops . The information is then used to assess the long-term risk of cancer and neurological problems in these children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all are used on fruits and vegetables frequently consumed by children , including peas , carrots , fruit juices and applesauce . Among the key findings : <P>  --  Youngsters receive four times as much exposure on average as adults to the eight carcinogenic pesticides evaluated . As many as 6,200 of today 's preschoolers , the study predicts , may develop cancer sometime in their life as a result of pesticide-contaminated produce they consume as children . <P>  --  Daminozide ( trade name : Alar ) , a chemical that is used chiefly on red apples and that penetrates the fruit 's skin , is the greatest cancer hazard . The NRDC predicts that daminozide use may cause one case of cancer for every 4,200 preschoolers . Though the percentage of children affected  --  0.024%  --  is minute , the risk is 240 times the standard considered acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency  --  one case of cancer per million . <P>  --  Exposure to four carcinogenic fungicides , including Captan and Mancozeb , may lead to one case of cancer per 33,000 to 160,000 children , two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 million youngsters are exposed to unsafe levels of organophosphate insecticides that may cause neurological damage . Among the crops treated by these chemicals are tomatoes , green beans and cucumbers . <P> The NRDC report goes on to charge that the Government is failing to protect youngsters adequately from such dangers . It points out that current legal limits for pesticide residues , set by the EPA , are based on the consumption patterns and physiology of adults . Children eat a great deal more food for their body weight than adults . They also consume more fruit , which makes up an estimated 34% of preschoolers ' diets , in contrast to 20% for adults ' . Youngsters eat six times as many grapes , seven times as many apples and seven times as much applesauce as their parents . The typical preschooler drinks 18 times as much apple juice as the average woman . Thus the child 's ingestion of pesticides is likely to be greater .
