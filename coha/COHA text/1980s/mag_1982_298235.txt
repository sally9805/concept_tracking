Uncle Sam may have just the parcel for you <P> When people first came to the West , particularly from the owned and fought-over farmlets of Europe , and saw so much land to be had for the signing of a paper and the building of a foundation , an itching land-greed seemed to come over them . They wanted more and more land-good land if possible , but land anyway . . . The early settlers took up land they did n't need and could n't use ; they took up worthless land just to own it . - John Steinbeck , East of Eden <P> The advertisements are not conspicuous . They do not cover billboards or blare from the television set . They appear instead as small-print public notices in local newspapers or obscure items in official Government publications . Taken together , though , their import is unmistakable : the U.S. Government is about to hold its biggest real estate sale since the opening of Oklahoma . <P> From amber waves of grain to purple mountain majesties , America is selling a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighthouse overlooking one of the most spectacular stretches of California 's rugged coastline ? Just such a property is going on the block . A piece of prime bottom land in the Midwest ? The Government is prepared to part with several hundred acres worth . Looking for privacy ? Uncle Sam is offering mountaintops and ranger stations in Montana and New Hampshire . <P> Nor is this all . Uncle Sam is selling off prime property in the heart of New York City and on the outskirts of Philadelphia , a piece near the Las Vegas Strip and a chunk of Waikiki Beach . It is unloading Air Force bases , military ammunition plants , and dozens of dams and water projects . For those who might want to acquire apparently useless land for the simple satisfaction of owning it , the Government is offering- at bottom dollar , if necessary-watersheds , flood plains and deserts . <P> The scope of the proposed sales is enormous . By the beginning of next year , the Reagan Administration hopes to dispose of 307 parcels totaling 60,000 acres . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Administration intends to get rid of 35 million acres by Executive Order . This is 5% of the Government 's land holdings and constitutes an area the size of Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont and Massachusetts combined . If the first five-year plan is successful , the Government may decide to sell more in the future . Both President Reagan and his Interior Secretary James Watt are convinced that the U.S. owns far more land than it needs or can manage . And both believe that unneeded land should be turned over to private owners . <P> The Government should find no shortage of buyers . Land has always been an important part of the American dream . The settlers began by clearing the forests around Jamestown , Va. , 350 years ago . Then they crossed the continent like a slow but inexorable army , laying claim to property to build homes , to grow food , to graze cattle , to protect water supplies . Their eagerness was understandable . Never mind how large and grand the continent of North America was , the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no way to create any more .
