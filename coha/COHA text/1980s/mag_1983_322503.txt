Dr. Hans Selye , the father of stress research , mapped the hormonal pathways shown in the illustration above some 40 years ago . Since then , scientists have found that stress provokes a number of even subtler chemical changes in the body that may have profound effects on health , both physical and mental . " There is a constant intertwining of stress systems , " says Stanford Neurochemist Jack Barchas . " It 's much like a symphony . " <P> Over the past two decades , researchers have learned that stress triggers chemical changes in the brain . Particularly sensitive to emotional strains are the concentrations of potent chemicals called neurotransmitters , which act as messengers between nerve cells . Among these messengers : serotonin , epinephrine ( previously called adrenaline ) , norepinephrine , acetylcholine and dopamine . In a study at Stanford , rats were forced to swim in 4C water for three minutes . Examination of their brain tissue afterward revealed that levels of norepinephrine had fallen 20% and epinephrine 30% to 40% . Scientists also discovered that the body produces its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of these an algesics , raising the pain threshold . This may explain the mystery of why seriously injured soldiers often feel no pain . <P> Because stress alters the body 's chemical balance , it seems to influence the development of many diseases , including psychiatric disorders . Depression has been associated with low levels of two neurotransmitters , serotonin and norepinephrine . Similarly , schizophrenia seems to be related to an excess of dopamine . <P> Perhaps the most significant new discovery about stress is its deleterious effect on the immune system . Researchers have discovered that the body 's production of its own cancer-fighting cells , including natural killer cells , T-lymphocytes and macrophages , is inhibited by chronic stress . <P> In late 1981 scientists at the Salk Institute synthesized the remarkable chemical that triggers the body 's stress reactions . As illustrated above , the substance , called corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) , is produced in the hypothalamus , a tiny but powerful structure sometimes called " the brain 's brain . " Having duplicated CRF , the Salk scientists now hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually block the body 's reaction to stress .
