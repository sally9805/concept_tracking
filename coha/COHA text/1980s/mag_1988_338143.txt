It seems pretty certain he can read , but can Johnny write ? Fans of Johnny Carson will find out this week when the Tonight Show 's host returns to the air with monologues he has written himself . The strike by the Writers Guild has idled the staff of eight that normally produces Carson 's jokes , and only reruns of the talk show have appeared since March 8 . Though the strike goes on , Carson said he will write his own material because he is determined to get the show back into production and keep the rest of his employees from losing their paychecks . <P> The new assignment may be an arduous one for Carson , who has not written in years , and is famous for his three-day workweek and lengthy vacations . To ease the load , the show will do without the familiar skits . So while Johnny is back , Carnac the Magnificent may be out for the duration .
