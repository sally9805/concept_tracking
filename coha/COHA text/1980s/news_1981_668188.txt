CONCORD , N.H. - A legislative package that would dramatically reform the state ' s Department of Employment Security ( DES ) has quietly picked up the bipartisan support of legislative leaders in the House of Representatives , almost assuring its passage there , according to House leaders . As well , according to some state Senate members , the package , which will be unveiled by Gov . Hugh J. Gallen and sponsoring legislators at a news conference tomorrow , has a good chance of passing the state ' s conservative- controlled Senate . In recent years , attempts to reform the relatively independent state unemployment compensation agency have died in the Senate . The legislation , authored by Gallen ' s staff , will seek to remove the department ' s blanket exemption from the state ' s Right-to-Know Law , limit the lifetime term of the DES commissioner to five years , give the governor and his executive council more control over who is named to the DES Advisory Board , and grant the Legislature the power to review the department ' s budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . In the past , separate items of the proposed legislation have passed the House . Attempts to make the department accountable under the state ' s Right-to- Know Law , which opens most government documents and meetings to the public , have been introduced at least three times in the last three sessions , meeting varying degrees of success . But this year the legislation , the most comprehensive ever , has picked up the early - and unusual - support of both parties . During Gallen ' s inaugural address Thursday , legislators interrupted his speech twice with applause when he attacked the DES , calling it " a department which considers it an empire in and of itself . " " There will be 100 sponsors in the House by the time it gets through , " said Thomas Cooper , Gallen ' s legal counsel and a member of his legislative team . " Then it will probably pass by a vote of 250 or more in the House . " Both Republican House leader Leigh D. Bosse ( R-Hillsboro ) and Democratic House leader Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . " It ' s a bill of broad sweeping reforms that in my view are consistent with the position the House has taken in the past and it ' s consistent with the Sunset Committee staff recommendations for reform of the DES , " Bosse said yesterday . The key to passing the legislation , however , will ultimately rest in the Senate . State Sen. Robert Preston ( D-Hampton ) said the reforms have a good chance of passing the Senate this year because the effort is designed to stay clear of any personal attack on DES Comr . Benjamin Adams , who holds that position for life and is a friend of many Senate members . " Last time , it was a personal thing against Comr . Adams , " Preston said . " I don ' t think this bill is intended that way . " The bill is written so that the five-year limit to the commissioner ' s term will not apply retroactively , allowing Adams to stay until he retires . Adams has held the job for nearly 20 years . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation will have an additional - and especially strong - argument to use this year in selling the package . Under current state law , Adams has a free hand in running the agency . Armed with that independence , he refused a Gallen request to settle out of court with the US Labor Department on an order to bring the DES in line with federal regulations governing unemployment benefits to state and local government workers . Last October , the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Labor Department . That federal agency now threatens to revoke $40 million or more in 1978 payroll tax credits to New Hampshire businesses , money state business owners will have to pay back themselves if current efforts to get the sanctions dropped are unsuccessful . " The threat of the sanctions has brought the issue of the Department of Employment Security to a much higher level of visibility , " said Dayton Duncan , Gov . Gallen ' s chief of staff . " ( Senate President* Robert Monier won ' t be able to tuck the bill over in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has done in the past . " The bill would also permanently transfer the lawyers assigned to the department to the attorney general ' s office . Last fall , after the threat of the $40 million in sanctions became a real possibility , Gallen and acting Atty . Gen. Gregory Smith moved the lawyers from the DES building to Smith ' s office , using a little- known executive power . The legislation would solidify that transfer .
