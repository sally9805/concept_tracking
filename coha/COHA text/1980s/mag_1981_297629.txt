Cloudy Miami <P> To the Editors : <P> Miami , a paradise lost Nov. 23 ? No , invaded . At the moment we are under attack . I prefer to fight in a city that is developing with boundless potential than to cope in a city that is crumbling around me . <P> Paul McEwen Miami <P> Ever since word got out about your cover story on South Florida , all I have heard from local TV , radio and newspapers is how unfortunate that the report ran at the beginning of the tourist season .
