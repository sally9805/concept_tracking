Reagan and Congress snipe over the budget <P> Everybody 's calendar read " May 1983 . " But at the White House and on Capitol Hill , the politicians had mentally flipped the pages forward to Election Year 1984 . Washington was awash in harsh political rhetoric , ostensibly centered on the substance of the fiscal 1984 budget . In reality , the hectic week of name-calling and intrigue , climaxing in a topsy-turvy nighttime Senate session , was a fierce skirmish in the battle to determine which party can most credibly claim credit , or escape blame , for the state of the U.S. economy . When the smoke cleared , both sides were dug into trenches , steeling for a summer of Government by veto . <P> The President opened the hostilities on Monday with a rousing attack on " irresponsible spending " by Congress . Appearing before the National Association of Home Builders , Reagan ticked off a series of possible revenue-raising measures that were at various times considered , but never adopted , by the liberal Democrats in Congress . Each one , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home sales and a limit on mortgage interest deductions , brought shouts of " No , no , no ! " from his audience . He agreed with his critics that federal budget deficits " do matter , " but turned the issue around , claiming that " deficit spending represents one of the most alarming dangers to our republic and to the prosperity of our people . " Reagan contended that raising taxes to reduce the deficit is wrong . " The deficit doctors have their scalpels out , all right , but they are not poised over the budget , " he charged . " What they 're ready to operate on is your wallet . " This drew cheers . <P> The next night Reagan used a prime-time press conference to assail Congress again . " It is time to draw the Line , " he declared . " I will not support a budget resolution that raises taxes while we are coming out of a recession . I will veto spending bills that would rekindle the fires of inflation and high interest rates . " <P> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cuts and military spending increases obviously had something to do with the deficits that he now decries ? Explained a top Reagan aide : " Ronald Reagan will be cast as the guy who wants to keep down taxes . That is important politically . " For the White House , the acrimonious struggle in the Senate to pass a budget resolution had become virtually irrelevant . Declared a presidential aide : " We 've pretty well made up our minds on a budget strategy , no matter what the Senate does . " The plan , he went on , is for Reagan to veto any tax or nonmilitary spending increase that he considers too high , even if it leads to a stalemate with Congress .
