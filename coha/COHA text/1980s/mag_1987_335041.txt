The incredible bull market in stocks has produced billions in profits for investors over the past 4 1/2 years  --  and millions in losses for those caught in the market 's occasional steep downswings . That seesawing continued last week as the Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks ended the week at 2235.37 , after skyrocketing by 66.47 points one day and dropping by 51.13 the next . Amid the ups and downs , no investor has done better than George Soros , 56 . During the past two years alone , the soft-spoken , Hungarian-born manager of a fund known as Quantum has amassed a staggering $1.5 billion in profits for himself and a small group of foreign investors . Says Barton Biggs , global strategist for Morgan Stanley : " Soros really is a genius , our all-time champion . " <P> Quantum 's great leap in profits began with the move upward by the Dow from a level in the mid-1300s in August 1985 . Soros caught the market wave by investing heavily not only in U.S. stocks but also in very volatile stock- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times over , or , conversely , produce huge losses . Now the largest so-called hedge fund , Quantum uses its stock and bond portfolio as collateral to buy more stocks and securities . <P> Soros has an uncanny knack for switching successfully between stock , bond and money markets . In September 1985 he made what he calls the " killing of a lifetime "  --  about $150 million  --  by switching from dollar investments into Japanese yen . He took the plunge after learning that top officials of the five largest industrial countries ( Britain , France , Japan , West Germany , the U.S. ) had met at Manhattan 's Plaza Hotel . Soros ' guess : the five would lower the value of the dollar against other major currencies . <P> Born in Budapest , Soros moved to Britain in 1947 . He subsequently attended the London School of Economics . In 1956 he moved to the U.S. and worked for ten years as a broker and stock analyst . In 1969 Soros started the fund that became Quantum with only $250,000 . Members of the Rothschild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6 million . Since then the fund has grown mostly through reinvested profits . Because Quantum is registered outside the U.S. , Soros and a few members of his Manhattan-based management team are its only American investors . <P> Soros is as inventive at spending money as he is at making it . A large part of the more than $500 million Soros has earned from Quantum is given to three foundations that sponsor greater openness in his native Hungary and other Communist societies . Dozens of Hungarian writers and scientists , actors and artists , who lack government endorsement and support for their activities , live on Soros Foundation grants . In addition , Soros is now bankrolling a dozen Hungarian high school graduates each year to study at Oxford . Earlier this month Soros flew to Moscow to see whether a " Glasnost " foundation could be established to test how serious Mikhail Gorbachev is about his new " openness " policy . <P> In a forthcoming book , The Alchemy of Finance : Reading the Mind of the Market , Soros argues that a financial disaster of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments will coordinate their economic policies to avert calamity . Whichever way the economic winds blow , Soros intends to profit from them . All the evidence so far strongly suggests that he will , and handsomely at that .
