A major poet can be recognized by his ( and , though rarely , ' ' her ' ' ) clear and individual style , the way he wields the sword of language to carve out a personal niche in the great body of Literature . Lorine Niedecker sculpted delicate , crisp , multifaceted gems , poems made from the sound and image of everyday experience . She stripped these voices of their excess detail and shaped them over a lattice of line , line-break , and silence . What was mundane and flat before is suddenly afire once her pen has crossed it . She is a magnificently sensitive poet who composed in a minor key - and there are few ' ' major ' ' poets in contemporary letters who can approach her mastery of craft and level of honesty. // Revered among poets , she was frequently compared to Emily Dickinson in both her life style and her work , and though she modestly deflected what she took to be lavish praise there is a great kinship . Like Emily , she was a solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lived almost all her life on the Rock River in Wisconsin , far from the glare of literary centers . She used the water , rocks , flora and fauna , and the people she met as the subjects for her writing . Here is one of her small poems the tone and style of which bring her Amherst counterpart to mind . <> What bird would light <> in a moving tree <> the tree I carry <> for privacy ? <> Down in the grass <> the question ' s inept ; <> sora ' s eyes . . . <> stillness steps . <> Such tiny poems , such a refined focus . . . . How can I describe the awesome effect they can have on a person ? Have you ever spent a moment with a raindrop ? Just a single watery pearl , on a window or finger tip , isolated from the mass and movement of the great sweep of rain ? You know , then , what such a moment reveals to you ; I wouldn ' t presume to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bud , a thistle seed , a flake of crystal . In the expansion of your senses , in the almost overwhelming detail , the tiny element speaks of astounding revelations about the massive world of which it is a part , an essence . But the great surprise is not in the raindrop or the seed , but in you . When you turn back to the daily scene , you are suddenly aware of the relationship of that moment ' s stillness to the rest of your life . It fosters an almost painfully beautiful clarity in your perspective . At this juncture , at the meeting of clarity and mystery , Lorine Niedecker performs her work . She refers to it as ' ' condensing , ' ' as if all she had to do was remove the clutter , the distraction , and there it is : a poem , waiting. // But can you imagine those clear spaces , not examined in isolation from the daily flow , but always present : a part of the mundane chores , the casual conversations , the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life , the spirit that spills over to us as we read her poems. // <> Grandfather <> advised me : <> Learn a trade <> I learned <> to sit at desk <> and condense <> No layoff <> from this <> condensery // A passage in the Hindu Vedas warns of the danger of ' ' putting words between the truth and ourselves . ' ' This is an injunction that writers must take very seriously if they want their work to become more than decoration and diversion . In her poems , Niedecker sets down the separate components of conscious experience with remarkable care ; rather than explain them , her words seem to set up a sympathetic vibration between the elements which draws us closer , urges us to listen for sense and resonance . And in each poem is a vast silence , the unsaid imagination ; it is the reader ' s own feeling that rushes in to fulfill the creation . Here is a small example : <> The smooth black stone <> I picked up in true source park <> the leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry <> home // It is only a curious little poem until you begin to ask yourself questions . ' ' True source park ' ' : a place ? a state of mind ? Stone into leaf ; leaf into stone ; the slow weaving of ages and ages . ' ' Why should we hurry . . . . ' ' Home from the park ? From the precious moment ? Back to our house or back into dust and rock ? // The elegant precision of word/sense is not abandoned in her longer poems . ' ' My Life By Water ' ' is a compressed portrait of the place she made her home , rich with the sound and the feel of the river ' s presence . The poem that begins ' ' The great snowfall. . . ' ' is a vision of blue-collar America , realistic in both descriptive and psychological detail . She did , in fact , work ' ' right down among em ' ' in print shops , libraries , and as a cleaning woman in hospitals . She doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for bitterness and cruelty ; but neither does she diminish it . ' ' But what vitality ! ' ' she exclaims ; they provide the steam , the enthusiasm , the go that makes this American machine function . In exchange for her hours of work she earned the security of home ; her long walks and evenings of reading ; and her own peculiar occupation . ' ' What would they say if they knew . . . . ' ' But hardly any of her friends or neighbors knew , even at the time of her death in 1970 , the great gift of reflection she was fashioning - for them as well as herself. // They say great poets innovate , revolutionize . . . . Lorine just refined her poet ' s tools : sharp eye , clear voice , focused feeling , loving word . Her writings have the remarkable effect of making you want to think and think more finely , with more care and more pleasure than before . She makes the leaping from moment to marvel seem always present , possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem , is as carefully cut as a crystal snowflake , falling ( it would seem ) as effortlessly . But when it lands on your hand , tongue , eye . . . it doesn ' t melt ; it sprouts . From each word , seedlike , springs perception ; from verse : universe. // In our age , even poets can trade their art for stardom just like all the professional performers ; and unfortunately , many are concentrating on just that . When I taste the sense and beauty in Lorine Niedecker ' s work , her life , it becomes much easier to choose between the gaudy distractions and the true gifts of our human existence . There is a courage , a sense of purpose in her long quiet dedication that stands out among the art-performers as a work of genuine greatness. // //
