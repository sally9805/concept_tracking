Once again , the budgets of the federal and state agencies that support the arts are to be cut . Meanwhile , costs in the arts are going up ? rent , utilities , printing , and various incidental expenses . Yet one continues to read and hear of one more dance group being formed , yet another chamber orchestra making its debut , newborn theater companies striving to lure audiences , festivals and exhibits being organized . Each new enterprise is self-assured of prestige , confident of support , and hungry for subsidy from public and private funds . This disparity between shrinking means and growing supply points to attitudes and assumptions about art that have not been examined for a long time . The most common assumption is that there can not be too much art , and hence that the public has an obligation to support whatever qualifies under that name . If private funds fall short , let public money make up the difference . Some rethinking is in order , aimed at developing a new standard of judgment and behavior . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art " and " public art " are given sharper definition . The tendency to speak of Art with a capital A is the first cause of confusion . Art is not a substance like milk , of which the need and use are self-evident . What the public is offered in the name of Art is a multitude of objects and performances that differ significantly in quality and in kind . There is popular art , supplied by entertainers who thrive without any subsidy . They are public heroes and heroines , well supported by worshipful followings . Michael Jackson has never applied for a federal grant , and Barbara Cartland does not need a Guggenheim in order to write her next book . Another type of art is relatively unpopular , but it is of course very popular with its devotees . Auditoriums , museums , and theaters are frequently Jacques Barzun is an author and teacher . A new collection of his essays , A Word or Two Before You Go , will be published in the fall . Museums and libraries have entered the retail and mail-order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cuff links , ashtrays , calendars , and reproductions of drawings and paintings in all sizes . The New York Public Library rents out its lobby for dinners and cocktail parties ; the Boston Athenaeum , besides running cruises to " art spots , " let out its premises for the filming of The Bostonians . In Washington , the galleries of the Phillips Collection can be rented for the evening for $5,000 . As for the artists , most are periodically in dire straits . Seeing this spectacle , the devotees of art are apt to lash out at what is commonly called " our materialistic society . " It should pay for high art more lavishly . This is nonsense . All known societies have been materialistic ; human society exists solely for material purposes . Ours is unusual precisely in its generous expenditures on art , education , philanthropy , and other good works . Selfishness and philistinism are hardly our present trouble : some of the most fervent expressions of concern about the arts have come from businessmen and politicians . There is among our leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget cuts come , it is because of other pressing claims ? the poor , the sick , the unemployed , the roads , the schools . In short , the trouble is not with the public opinion of art or the public outlay for it ; it lies in the distribution of the funds , which since the 1930s has been guided ? if the word is applicable ? by totally unexamined ideas about " the arts . " The notion of an oversupply of art is never raised . We are familiar Schools watch over every spark of talent and try to fan it to a raging ambition . The finger paintings of two-year-olds are put up on classroom walls and child poetry is publicly recited . This encouragement continues in colleges and in art and drama schools , where scholarships and prizes spur whole classes to proficiency . The resume of any artist , or would-be artist , shows a string of awards , certificates , and commendations . Technique and professional skill are no longer distinguishing features ; they are the norm . But the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can these talents find a social use corresponding to their preparation ? The competition is intense . Young musicians , actors , and dancers form little groups , get a good notice , and immediately join the scrimmage for support . In painting and writing , the fight is to get into a gallery or a publishing house , only to be told that galleries are overcrowded and that first novels are not publishable . In short , with the best of intentions , we have created a glut . Encouragement has bred expectation , and proliferating expectations have outrun resources . Consider the glut in Greater New York . According to a report of the Port Authority , there are some 117,000 jobs related to the arts in the New York metropolitan area , yielding a total income of $2 billion a year . What is the reality behind the figures ? After you have counted the handful of well-known museums and theaters , the opera and ballet troupes performing outdoors and in concert halls , you must add the orchestras , native and visiting ; the infestation of chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the almost round-the-clock lectures and poetry readings . Uncounted other " distributors " of art offer their wares . The churches present plays and Sunday afternoon transcriptions on the organ of works written for orchestra . At the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , one can see a Miskito Indian fertility dance performed at the altar and roller skaters in the aisles enlivening the Gloria during the service . In the summer , there is free music in the sunken plaza of Rockefeller Center , Leonard Bernstein goes to Jones Beach to conduct another program , and Joseph Papp rewrites Shakespeare for strollers in the city parks . One may say that New York is a world capital , where a concentration of art is to be expected . True , but in many other cities and towns , as well as in " art parks " and converted barns in the open country , the high arts are proffered to the native and the visitor . Regional theaters are on the increase : festivals short and long resound everywhere ? Texas alone advertises over 200 . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end this recital by stressing the ubiquity of art in our lives . There is a piece of art in the anteroom of many business firms ? the image to build up the image . There is art in good hotel and motel rooms , either original works or reproductions ? such as the pair of Van Gogh sunflowers t once found , one on each side of a bureau . There is art at conferences and meetings : the sound of a string quartet graces a discussion of Niels Bohr at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ; the annual report of a faculty club where the food is debatable boasts that in the last fiscal year the club sponsored two evenings of chamber music . lready in 1840 , Balzac noted with dismay that there were 2,000 painters in Paris . Degas , fifty years later , said : " We must discourage the arts . " But the ever enlarging display of art can not , of course , be cut or held back . We can pay farmers not to grow crops , but we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be done . To lead people on when there is no chance they will ever fulfill their desire is immoral . And our training schools , art councils , endowments , and foundations are doing just that . They flatter the hope and belief that every good work and worker will be recognized and subsidized . When no such thing happens , anger and distress naturally follow . Nor does the artist 's anger refer merely to money . Government grants are awarded by persons ( often themselves artists ) who assume the role of bureaucrat . Their role cuts them off from the community of applicants . Subsidy , even by a private foundation , is an official act , and on this subject the French experience of 300 years is conclusive . In France , those who produced the works we admire today had to survive as best they could , outside of officialdom and often in angry opposition to it . By contrast , the term " official art " means art that is competent and safe . Our current cultural attitudes lead to an oversupply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , institutions of the highest caliber struggle to keep alive the masterworks of the past and to add to them modern works of comparable worth , In the distribution of funds , both the producers and the caretakers are treated alike ? and come out the same : disappointed and ill nourished . Only a change of policy , following a change of attitudes , can put an end to this demoralizing catch-ascatch-can . The first step would be to accept a distinction between " public art " and all the rest . What do I mean ? History gives the answer : over the centuries public money has been provided mainly for public art and public institutions ? museums , libraries , opera houses , orchestras , theaters , and dance troupes . All other artistic efforts have been supported by individual patrons and small groups of amateurs or have flourished quietly , locally , with no thought of wider recognition . Let us call this activity domestic art , because it corresponds to what people of an earlier age provided for themselves at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the art now produced is domestic art trying to become public art . There is no reason to neglect or look down on the domestic kind . But there is also no reason to support it with public monies . Its abundance is what creates the fierce competition for those monies ? which in turn drives the true public institutions increasingly to become gift shops , bazaars , mail order houses , and cocktail bars . No doubt a certain number of those trained by our schools are of which the greater part in fact goes to stagehands , electricians , printers , landlords , and various profit-making suppliers . Moreover , the whole strength of public support ? of taxpayers ' dollars ? would thus be freed to sustain public art , that is , the acknowledged public institutions : museums , libraries , orchestras , theaters , and opera houses . In each region these establishments are known to all , open to all , and subject to public criticism when their standards decline . If as a nation we hold the view that high art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same footing as police departments and weather bureaus . And I mean support , not meager help after periodic anguish and pleading . The public has already recognized the social worth of these institutions by granting them tax exemption . The rest of their needs should be fully met , so as to free them for their work and take them out of petty commerce . should add that in sketching these possibilities , I have not been inspired by the current effort to reduce the role of government in society . It is thirty years since I first expressed these views . Nor am I thinking of money alone , or artistic ambition alone , when I urge this new soberness . I am thinking of high culture as a whole and our relation to it . In the competition:for cash , punctuated by elegant ballyhoo , in the overabundance of the offering and the fuss about it in print and on the airwaves , something has happened to the artistic experience itself . Its quality has been lowered by plethora . Great works too often seen or performed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumption instead of objects of contemplation . They lose force and depth by being too familiar through too frequent or too hurried use . When I hear of someone 's " spending the day at the museum , " I wonder at the effect : the intake is surely akin to that of an alcoholic . Music likewise is anesthetic when big doses ? symphony after symphony , opera on top of opera ? are administered without respite . We should remember the Greeks ' practice of exposing themselves to one tragic trilogy and one comedy on but a single day each year . High art is meant for rare festivals , where anticipation is followed by exhilaration and the aftermath is meditation and recollection in tranquillity . The glut has made us into gluttons , who gorge and do not digest . Such a condition disables one for judging new art . The eager or dutiful persons who subject themselves to these tidal waves of the classics and the modems find everything wonderful in an absent-minded way . The wonder washes over them rather than into them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd suddenly " interesting . " Interesting is the word you will most often hear from devotees of the arts when faced with new tricks cleverly contrived . And so another byproduct of our come one , come all policy is the tendency to reward cleverness , not art , and to put one more hurdle in the path of the truly original artist .
