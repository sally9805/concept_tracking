The inference is that feminine impulse is greater than feminine money sense. // The notion isn ' t rooted entirely in myth - most women will admit they ' re more at home clipping food coupons than bond coupons .

All money in joint accounts can be frozen in case of her husband ' s death , and she may not have access to it until the estate is settled . In case of divorce , all jointly held funds can be divided equally , even if one person has contributed more . And if she doesn ' t know where all the family money is tied up , she can ' t lay claim to it if she is divorced or widowed. // Even if she has nothing else to do with the family money , there is one financial imperative for a married woman , advises Mr. Abrams : Read the family ' s annual tax return. // ' ' There is one particular thing that every woman has to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who takes care of their bank account , they always have to sign the tax return .

' ' // ' ' One alternative was shared housing , to bunk up with another family on AFDC ( Aid to Families with Dependent Children ) , ' ' says a Boston welfare worker , but ' ' next year ' s ( federal ) budget proposal would require a roomie ' s income to be counted in welfare formulas. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who asked not to be identified , explains her method of controlling spending , which closely parallels the budget advice offered by many financial advisers : ' ' When I ' m really low on cash , I make a menu .

We sit down and plan out where the next check will go , ' ' continues the Boston woman , who gets $595 a month in welfare and food stamps. // Vicki Williams , an unemployed Indiana factory worker determined to stay off welfare rolls , knows that every penny does count , adding that she leaves the shopping up to her husband , who has a better knack for finding bargains .

' ' She may owe that to one of the working class background rules-of- thumb she and her husband adhered to : never buy on credit. // On the other hand , she says , outside of a land investment they intend to keep , the Williamses had no systematic plan for savings or investment while they were both employed .

' ' // These examples illustrate alternating resourcefulness and ignorance about money management . Where there is ignorance , it is identical to that of higher income earners who complain they can ' t accumulate savings . The resourcefulness is the sort of financial expertise borne of necessity rather than choice . Financial advisers agree it is a ' ' crisis ' ' that most often pushes women into financial responsibility . It can be a husband ' s death or divorce . Or it can be the realization that ' ' you ' re the only thing that stands between your children and institutions , ' ' says Janet Diamond , a representative of the Coalition for Basic Human Needs , a Boston welfare rights organization run by welfare recipients. // At first glance , the survival instinct that low-income women develop bears little resemblance to the academic personal finance methods touted by today ' s crop of self-help seminars and money books. // But their cost-cutting measures , some of which admittedly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could learn from . Low-income women understand the basics higher income earners sometimes don ' t . These techniques often are only enough to keep bread on the table for poor people and not enough to start amassing capital , which is the key element in developing a stable financial situation . But given some margin , experts agree , these are the money management methods that could set a financial plan straight. // ' ' I would never say that you can save money on a welfare paycheck . You can ' t . You ' re talking about being below the irreducible minimum , ' ' says Jane Bryant Quinn , the syndicated columnist who wrote ' ' Everyone ' s Money Book . ' ' But she suggests that saving money is possible at almost any income level. // ' ' I know people making quite substantial sums of money who can ' t find $10 or $15 to suddenly deal with a school trip or something because they have simply overextended themselves . And there are people who make much less money and who are living comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more than you need . You can have a little more than you need at all kinds of income brackets . It ' s an attitude where you say , ' This is how much money I make , therefore this is how I live and can still put a little aside . ' You can have that attitude at any income level. ' ' // One financial counselor at the Chase Exchange , a Chase Manhattan Bank financial service for women , confirms the irony , noting that a complaint common to people of all income levels is that they don ' t have enough money or they can ' t save. // Experts like Ms. Quinn and those at the Chase Exchange promote strict budgeting methods for savings and investment . But , counters Mary Ann Saffelo , a divorced mother of two , ' ' When you ' re below the poverty level and people tell you to learn to budget , that ' s a joke . ' ' After leaving her $20 , 000-a-year California factory job because of a disability , her financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $379 , but her rent alone was $358 . Simple arithmetic illustrates her position. // Is there any way out of the financial mire for women like this ? Often without the hope of employment  --  something that would pay more than basic welfare  --  there is no way out . Education has been a sure ticket up ( although social program cuts are limiting the amount of aid available for women to get training ) . // There are two problems , explains Ms. Diamond. // ' ' Workfare will make it absolutely impossible to go to school , ' ' she says , referring to the federal welfare reform that would force AFDC recipients to accept minimum-wage jobs with social services agencies or risk the loss of benefits. // The other problem , she explains , is getting poor women to think beyond the weight of their immediate situation .

Being unable to conceive of a job in those terms , she doesn ' t go after the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . For women , to be a failure in the job market is OK - she wasn ' t socialized to think she could ( succeed ) , ' ' concludes Ms. Diamond. // This socialization is changing , though , as women begin to perceive more clearly their economic roles as breadwinners and as independent financial entities .
