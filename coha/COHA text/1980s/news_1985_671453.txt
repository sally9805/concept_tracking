The broken hose , he said , was part of the price he had to pay to drive the bumpy pavement of Interstate 95 through Connecticut to get to his destination in New Hampshire. // " The Jersey side of 95 is good , but when you cross into New York and Connecticut , this road is bad , " Mr. Fling said. // " I don ' t mind paying the tolls if you ' ve got a good road to drive on , " he said . But as for I-95 , he said , " I ' d rather drive a dirt road. " // // The Highway Lifeline // Interstate 95 is the highway lifeline of the Northeast , the most direct route connecting its major population and commercial centers , such as Boston ; Providence , R.I. ; New York ; Newark ; Philadelphia ; Wilmington , Del . , Baltimore and Washington. // But the highway has some serious problems , particularly along its most congested sections through New York and Connecticut , according to highway officials who try to manage it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no question that the road is overburdened , and its traffic use is way beyond its design capacity , " J. William Burns , the Connecticut Transportation Commissioner , said of the portion of the route in his state. // " It ' s way beyond what anyone ever envisioned when the road was designed and built " in the 1950 ' s , he said. // Now , after years of increasing traffic and deterioration along many of its sections , state highway agencies from Rhode Island to Maryland have embarked on a series of major improvements to the northeastern portion of the route , which in its entirety stretches from Maine to Florida . The combined cost would be more than $1. 2 billion . <> <> Lines Being Filled In // Dotted lines on the road maps , denoting uncompleted sections , are being filled in at Baltimore and Philadelphia . Roadways and bridges in other places , such as Delaware and Rhode Island , are receiving major repairs , in some cases for the first time in more than 20 years. // Connecticut , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two to three years on the Connecticut Turnpike , which carries the designation of I-95 through most of the state. // The work is part of a 10-year , $5. 5 billion rebuilding program , which the state began on all its roads and bridges following the collapse of a section of the Mianus River Bridge in Greenwich in 1983 and a series of fatal accidents on the turnpike. // Starting Jan. 1 , Connecticut will stop collecting the 35-cent toll on the turnpike . Temporary roadways will be build around the eight toll plazas , which will be torn down . The roadway will be repaved , 22 bridges will be overhauled and concrete median barriers will be installed on the 50-mile stretch between Greenwich and New Haven . <> <> Major Overhaul in Westchester // On the New York side , the New York Thruway Authority has jurisdiction over the 15-mile stretch of I-95 known as the New England Thruway , which runs from the northern Bronx through Westchester County to the Connecticut line . The authority began work last month on a major overhaul that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five years. // " It ' s a total rehabilitation of the entire section - roads and bridges , lighting , center lane dividers and exit and access ramps , " David F. Alexander , a spokesman for the Thruway Authority , said. // " That road down there is so heavily traveled it never received the attention it should , " Mr. Alexander said . " It ' s got to be done , " he said of the repair work . " It will be inconvenient , but it will be a fine road when it ' s done. " // But even these major repairs , some transportation officials said , will be only temporary solutions for the highway ' s traffic load. // The New Jersey Turnpike Authority is beginning a long-range engineering study of possible expansion to the western leg of the turnpike , which runs through the Meadowlands near Newark . The turnpike carries the designation of I-95 from the interchange at Exit 6 with the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the George Washington Bridge , 67 miles to the north . <> <> Reached Saturation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far exceeded what we had expected , " said Gordon Hector , a spokesman for the turnpike authority . " We thought we would reach saturation by 1990 , and it ' s already there , " he said. // More than 400 , 000 vehicles a day - sometimes as many as 500 , 000 - use the northern part of the turnpike . " That volume once was unheard of , but now it is becoming commonplace , " Mr. Hector said. // The Connecticut Transportation Department is planning a study of long-range transportation needs of the corridor through Fairfield County , including the turnpike , the Merritt Parkway , Route 1 and the New Haven rail line. // " It ' s a particularly tough corridor to do much about with the intensity of development from New Haven all the way to the New York line , " Mr. Burns said. // While I-95 may appear on the map as one long line , in reality it is a succession of different highways . Only the red , white and blue road markers are the same. // Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases different departments and authorities in the same state - administer each section . <> <> Varied Use of Highway // Paying for the improvements also differs from state to state . The Federal Government is paying 90 percent of the cost of work under way in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island , for instance , but Connecticut is using state funds because the toll-supported turnpike has not been eligible for Federal funds. // Also , the use of the highway is as varied as the countryside through which it passes. // According to the Federal Highway Administration , 81 , 646 vehicles used the Interstate each weekday in Howard County , Md. , north of Washington , during 1983 , the most recent year for which figures were available . At Cranston , R.I. , the count was only 25 , 716. // At the George Washington Bridge , the average weekday volume was 128 , 029 , and that was only in the eastbound lanes , where the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey collects tolls. // On the Connecticut Turnpike in the Greenwich-Stamford area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 to 100 , 000 a day and occasionally reach 120 , 000 , Mr. Burns said. // East of New Haven , the count drops to only about 20 , 000 vehicles a day . " The whole character of that road , once you get east of New Haven , is different , both in appearance and traffic use , " Mr. Burns said . " The medians are wider ; it ' s much more rural. " // The costliest project under way the interstate in the Northeast is the construction of the Fort McHenry Tunnel under the harbor in Baltimore . Work began on the 1. 7-mile tunnel in 1980 and is scheduled to be finished late this fall to complete the final link of I-95 through Maryland . <> <> Largest Project in History // At a cost of more than $800 million , it is the largest single project in the history of the interstate system , according to Maryland officials. // Pennsylvania is finishing its last link of I-95 with the construction of 2. 7 miles of bridges and ramps at the Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $198. 5 million , is scheduled to begin opening by the end of the year with completion in 1986 , according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. // For the truckers , whose Peterbilts and Kenworths were parked in neat rows behind the truck plaza just off I-95 here , the highway improvements can not come soon enough , especially in Connecticut. // " From the beginning of Connecticut down past Exit 56 , the road vibrates you out of your lane , " said Bob Peeples of Chicago , a driver for National Van Lines . " Connecticut is the worst , " he said. // Dave Nickerson of Falmouth , Mass. , who drives once or twice a week between Massachusetts and Florida , said I-95 in New Jersey , Delaware and Virginia was much better than in New York and Connecticut. // " They ' re always repaving , " he said . " Here you ' ve got frost heaves and potholes , " he said . " The truck takes a beating and the cargo takes a beating. " // David Gross , a trucker from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay us to drive it. " // He said he travels I-95 " two or three times a month - two or three times too many. " //
