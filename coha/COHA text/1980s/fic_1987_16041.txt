He had twelve hundred cash in his money clip and a Piaget watch , all untouched . &nbsp; REMY ( impressed ) Piaget ? &nbsp; MCCABEHere 's the wallet , they just got through lifting the prints . ( while Remy examines the wallet ) The driver 's license is missing . &nbsp; REMYSo what does that tell you , Detective McCabe ? &nbsp; MCCABEI figure the killer took it for proof of the hit .

No clues , leads ? &nbsp; REMY ( grins ) Not so far . Look , I 've seen dozens of these wise-guy jobs . We usually find out why the hit went down ; sometimes we find out who did it ; we even make an arrest once in a while , but we never have enough to take to court . Anne starts writing furiously on her legal pad . Her pencil point breaks . McCabe taps on Remy 's glass office door and opens it . &nbsp; MCCABESorry we 're late . He was n't at the barber shop , so we had to go pick him up at his house . &nbsp; REMYBring him in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters .

He used to work for me . Terrible thing . Nobody has any respect for monuments any more . He turns to leave again . Anne decides to jump in . &nbsp; ANNEWhat exactly did Mr. Angelo do for you ? The Cannon looks down at her appraisingly . Anne points her pencil at him . &nbsp; ANNEIs n't it a fact that he worked for you for twenty years ? Is n't it a fact that he was in your employ at the time of his death ? The Cannon looks at Remy as if to say " who the hell is this ?

Sorry to have troubled you . &nbsp; CANNONYou know kid , your father never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me , he 'd come to the house . He knew a little something about respect . The Cannon strides out of the office , followed by McCabe . Anne turns to Remy , steaming . Remy grins . &nbsp; ANNEI ca n't believe you were so obsequious with that man . &nbsp; REMYWhat does obsequious mean ? &nbsp; ANNEIt means you had a high ranking member of the Mafia in your office and you kissed his ass , that 's what it means . &nbsp; REMYI learned a lot from that little interview . Why do n't I tell you about it over lunch ? &nbsp; ANNEI do n't want to have lunch with you . Tell me now . &nbsp; REMYFirst , as a general point , nobody uses the word " mafia " anymore . Down here , we call ' em " wise guys . " I only mention this to save you embarrassment . &nbsp; ANNE ( wryly ) " Wise guys . " Got it . Now , will you tell me what you learned ? &nbsp; REMYWell , I learned almost enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hey , you like spicy food ? Why do n't we have dinner tonight ? I know a place . . .  --  12  --  &nbsp; ANNEGive it a rest , will you , Romeo ? Just tell me what you found out from two minutes of ass-kissing .

Killing him and dumping him in the Piazza d'Italia  - -  that was a message to Vinnie . &nbsp; ANNEAnd what was the message ? &nbsp; REMYWell , I think somebody 's telling him it 's time to retire . I brought him in to see how he looks . Six months ago , he had an operation  --  took out half his colon . Last time I saw him , he did n't have a hearing aid or a cane , either . He 's gotten old . Some of his people may be getting restless , &nbsp; ANNEThis is all sounding pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes to his barber every morning for a shave and a manicure . The fact that he stayed home tells us he got the message , too . . . &nbsp; ANNEYou 're amazingly sure of yourself . I suppose you know who the killer is , too ? &nbsp; REMYNo , but in a week or so , I bet we find his body with holes in it . &nbsp; ANNEThen what will you do ?  --  13  --  &nbsp; REMYNothing . We 'll never get anything we can take to court . Hell , I 'd close the ease right now except for one thing . &nbsp; ANNEWhat 's that ? &nbsp; REMYI 'll tell you over dinner .

He waves to Remy , holds up five fingers . &nbsp; REMY ( to Anne ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks around , agog at all this activity . This is not at all what she was expecting . Remy hands her her drink , clinks her glass with his . &nbsp; ANNENow , tell me why you 're not closing the Angelo case . &nbsp; REMYWe have n't had dinner yet . Remy grabs Anne by the hand , drags her , protesting , toward the dance floor . &nbsp; REMYCome on , let 's work up an appetite . &nbsp; ANNE ( shouts ) I thought we were here to discuss business . &nbsp; REMYWe will , we will . Business and pleasure . What 's wrong with that ? The dance floor is packed with bouncing , sweaty people . Anne allows herself to be led into the midst of it , a little intimidated , having a hard time picking up the idiosyncratic beat , &nbsp; REMYDid n't they dance where you come from ? Remy 's leading her into it , showing her the steps .  --  15  --  &nbsp; ANNENot me . I had other things to do . &nbsp; REMYWell , this is New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of life . Suddenly , she catches the beat , and they whirl together in a joyous , synchronized moment . Her hair tumbles down over her shoulders . CUT TO : 20 INT . K-PAUL 'S - LATER The dancing is over , the room has cleared out a bit . Anne and Remy are seated at a table in the back , picking over the remains of a sumptuous meal : crawfish etouffee , fil gumbo , " blackened " redfish . . . Anne is a little bit disheveled , tipsy , sweating and flushed from the spicy food , laughing at Remy putting on a Cajun accent . &nbsp; REMYMy people on my Mama 's side , dey wad the real Cajun , borned and deaded on the Bayou Teche . I used to pass myself down there in the summer wid my uncle Vern . A Cajun , he gets a little money in his pocket , he quit his job and spend it all .

You 're on committees to Save the Whales , Save the Children and Save the Atchafalaya Basin . You 're in the JANE FONDA WORKOUT , and you have three outstanding parking tickets . &nbsp; ANNE ( laughs ) You forgot the AAA and the ERA . &nbsp; REMYI could n't find anything out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yours . &nbsp; REMYFor instance ? &nbsp; ANNEYou were an altar boy . &nbsp; REMYIs that the juiciest thing you could find ? &nbsp; ANNEYou were married , briefly . . . &nbsp; REMYSix months .  --  17  --  &nbsp; ANNEYou 've had a series of love affairs since then , but nothing all that serious . Remy leans toward her , looks in her eyes . &nbsp; REMYTo me they were all serious . &nbsp; ANNEMy information says they were mostly stewardesses . &nbsp; REMYWhat 's wrong with stewardesses . Some of my best friends are stewardesses . You have a bad attitude toward women . Anne laughs , a little self-conscious . Remy suddenly takes her hand . &nbsp; REMY ( continuing ) Would you like me to tell you why I 'm not closing the Angelo case ? &nbsp; ANNE ( flustered ) That 's why I 'm here . &nbsp; REMYIt 's you . &nbsp; ANNE ( blushes ) Me ? &nbsp; REMYYes , you . Suddenly Remy is very much a cop . &nbsp; REMY ( continuing ) How come an assistant District Attorney on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine Mafia hit ? Anne pulls her hand away .

How come ? &nbsp; ANNEOur office has jurisdiction to investigate any crime we see fit . &nbsp; REMYThat 's not my question .

You honestly do n't see the harm in any of this ? &nbsp; REMYNo , I do n't see the harm in it . These are the perks . &nbsp; ANNEBut the restaurant is going to expect extra protection in return and expect the officer to overlook any code violations . &nbsp; REMYIf all the codes were enforced you would n't have a restaurant in this city that could stay open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , remains very cool . &nbsp; ANNESo now you 're defending a whole system of corruption . &nbsp; REMYI 'm not defending anything . It 's just the way things work in this town and always have . This is New Orleans , darlin ' . Folks have a certain way of doing things down here . ( jokes ) Anyway , it helps make up for the fact that cops are so underpaid . People like to show their gratitude . Anne snorts , offended by his smugness.  --  21  --  &nbsp; ANNESo how does it work ? You get free suits ? An envelope from Chef Paul every week ? Remy pulls up to a red light , gives her an amused , incredulous look . He plucks open the lapel of her blouse , looks down . &nbsp; REMYYou got a wire in there ? She smacks his hand away . Remy looks down the street , then drives straight through the red light . Anne rolls her eyes . &nbsp; ANNEYou can drop me on the corner up there . Remy pulls over . &nbsp; ANNEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does this stuff go ? Is everything for sale ? What does it cost to beat a murder rap ? &nbsp; REMY ( genuinely insulted ) Are you crazy ? Is that what you think about cops ? You got a real bad attitude about us . Remy flips down his " Police Business " visor . &nbsp; ANNEBeing around you for an evening certainly has n't done much to improve it . I 've never seen one person break so many laws in so short a space of time . . . &nbsp; REMY ( cutting her off ) Forget about the law . The way I see it , it 's very simple : there are the Good Guys and the Bad Guys . . . &nbsp; ANNE ( snorts ) And you 're the Good Guys ?  --  22  --  &nbsp; REMYDamn right . And we 're all that stands between you and them . Anne gets out of the car . Then turns back for a parting shot . &nbsp; ANNEDo n't think that I 'm naive . I know the way the system works . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change it ? She turns , starts away . Remy hops out of the car . &nbsp; REMY ( continuing ) This your building ? &nbsp; ANNEI live up the street , I want to get a few things . &nbsp; REMYI 'll wait and drive you the rest of the way . &nbsp; ANNEI 'd rather walk . &nbsp; REMYI 'll walk with you . &nbsp; ANNEThank you so much for an illuminating evening .

ANNE 'S STREET - NIGHT - LITTLE LATER Anne is walking up her street burdened by two plastic shopping bags in addition to her briefcase . Suddenly , behind her , a woman SCREAMS : &nbsp; WOMAN ( O.S. ) My purse !  --  23  --  Anne turns around to see a MUGGER running toward her , clutching a woman 's purse . Instinctively Anne swings one of her shopping bags at the mugger 's legs , and the mugger takes a nosedive into the pavement . But Anne does n't see . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smashes into the pavement with a sickening crunch . The wind 's been knocked out of her but still she grabs the Second Mugger 's ankle . He tries to twist away but . . . ANNE wo n't let go even though he 's dragging her alone the pavement , trying to kick his foot out of her grip . But now the . . . FIRST MUGGER has gotten up and has pulled a knife on Anne , either to threaten her or to stick her , but just then . . . REMY 'S LEBARON bounces up onto the sidewalk , knocks the First Mugger flying . In a flash , Remy 's out of the car , gun drawn and shouting . &nbsp; REMYPolice ! The Second Mugger tries to dodge past and Remy slams him on the side of the head with the pistol and he sinks to his knees . Remy levels his gun right at the First Mugger 's face no more than four feet away . &nbsp; REMY ( continuing ) Do n't screw up ! The First Mugger drops the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Remy stops her . &nbsp; REMY ( continuing ) Stay down for a second . ( to First Mugger ) Get down flat on your face . Right there . That 's right . ( to Second Mugger ) You , too , face down on the sidewalk there . &nbsp; SECOND MUGGERMe ? &nbsp; REMYNo , the Pope ! Face down .  --  24  --  Very cautiously Remy frisks his prisoners , one at a time , his gun covering them closely . He flings the contents of their pockets out into the gutter . Anne gets to her knees . Her dress is torn , her knee is scraped . She crawls a couple of feet to one of her shopping bags and is trying to put the contents back in the bag . &nbsp; REMY ( continuing ; to Anne ) Just sit there a minute . Good thing I 'm such a pushy guy , huh ? A dumpy , 55-years old WOMAN , the victim of the mugging , runs up , gasping for breath . Remy picks up the woman 's purse from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop ? Thank God you were here , I just cashed my paycheck . The Woman checks through her purse , then , satisfied that the contents are intact , starts to hobble away . &nbsp; REMYIf you 'll stay a moment , a patrolman will take your statement . &nbsp; WOMANYou think I 'm crazy or what ? And she leaves , muttering under her breath . Remy ignores her . He handcuffs the prisoners together , running the chain of the handcuffs through his LeBaron 's bumper so the prisoners ca n't get away . Remy crouches close to the Muggers and pitches his voice low , so that Anne can not hear him . &nbsp; REMYA patrol car is going to come for you in a little while . If you do anything to my car , if you even get fingerprints on the paint , they 're going to beat the living shit out of you . Understand ? &nbsp; FIRST MUGGERYes , sir !  --  25  --  &nbsp; REMYThe lady you just mugged is the Superintendent 's cousin . This neighborhood 's off limits as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get shot .
