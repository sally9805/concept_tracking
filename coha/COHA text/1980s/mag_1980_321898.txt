Olympic Cover <P> To the Editors : <P> What a cover photograph ! Never before have my eyes enjoyed such a pure quintessence in harmony , reality , perfection and effort as shown in the picture of Eric and Beth Heiden Feb. 11 . <P> Fabio A. Ridolfi Toronto <P> As models of perseverance and charisma , the Heidens have become towers of inspiration at home and pillars of diplomacy abroad . Win , place or show in Lake Placid , the Heidens rank at the top of living sports legends . <P> John Westman Hamilton , N. Y. <P> Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner are like thunder and lightning put together-electric ! Watching them skate makes you proud they 're Americans . <P> Sonja M. Larson Stanhope , Iowa <P> The Soviets Irina Rodnina and Alexander Zaitsev certainly are not " uninspired . " They are the best pair-skating team ever to take the ice . <P> Peggy Cote Baltimore <P> Before yanking the Olympics off to sanctified Greece , look at your Thucydides , wherein you 'll find that in 420 B.C. guards were used at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spartans , who had been barred from the Games , allegedly for violating an Olympic truce . Purity has always been in short supply , and history does indeed seem to repeat itself . Jack C. Rossetter Elmwood Park , Ill . <P> Debate About the Draft <P> Being eligible for the proposed draft Feb. 11 , I rue the possiblity of fighting and perhaps dying in an increasingly imminent military conflict . However , we can show the Kremlin that all young Americans can and will go to any lengths to ensure our nation 's freedom . By starting the draft now in peacetime , we wo n't be forced to start it in wartime . <P> Jeffrey Hagerty Chicago <P> They can take every car in the Gordon family and all the oil and gas that go with them , but they can not have my son . <P> Kathy Gordon Dallas <P> Since I am a student at the New York State Maritime College , it is almost inevitable that I will be in the midst of danger should a war break out . I feel the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America from Soviet aggression , but I do not feel women should be registered for the draft . <P> William J. Ruh Orchard Park , N. Y. <P> Once again old men talk of sending young men to war . With war mechanized , there is no valid reason why only young , poor men should serve . AU citizens between 18 and 62 should be subject to a random draft . Only the severely handicapped should be exempt . We might all be less inclined to rattle sabers if we thought we had to carry one into battle . <P> Carl O. Olson Fredonia , N. Y. <P> Where Are the Allies ? <P> In early January , when Australia 's Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced a hard-line policy toward the Soviets over their invasion of Afghanistan ( including a proposed Olympic Games boycott as well as trade sanctions ) , he was accused of making Australia more important than it really is . Since we did n't rate a mention in your article " Where Are Allies When Needed ? " Feb. 4 , maybe in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Wendy Maloney Montmorency , Australia
