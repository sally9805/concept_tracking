CHARIOTS OF FIRE Directed by Hugh Hudson Screenplay by Colin Welland <P> Seeing Chariots of Fire is like exploring a wonderful historical restoration . <P> All the brass has been polished , the draperies lovingly arranged , the superb craftsmanship of the antique furnishings set off by careful burnishing . At the very least one gets from the film an authentic sense of life as it must have been lived in a more gracious and perhaps more innocent time . <P> But there are real people moving through this movie 's rooms , historical characters driven by private obsessions . By insisting that the audience share the weight of the traditions that pressed down upon the actual people , by forcing attention on the nuances of manners and speech of England in the 1920s , and by simply taking their own sweet time about telling their tale , the film makers throw into high relief the powerfully contrasting passions of the characters . <P> Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell were , of all things , runners . But neither ran simply because he had the gift of speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a rich Jewish family , ever conscious , despite his enrollment at Cambridge , of subtle , painful discrimination . He would beat these gentlemen at their own avocation-amateur sport . If that goal required paying a professional coach ( wonderfully played by Ian Holm ) , a tactic that was against the code if not the formal rules , so be it . Liddell was of an entirely different breed . The modest and pious son of missionaries , he ran , as he saw it , for the glory of God . If his faith told him that he must not break the Sabbath by running on Sunday , then so be it . Never mind that the race he was passing up was a qualifying heat for the 1924 Olympics in Paris . Never mind that the Prince of Wales ( played with sublime twittiness by David Yelland ) was enlisted in the fruitless attempt to force him to trim his conscience . <P> That both men finally achieve athletic apotheosis in the Olympics is emotionally satisfying , of course , but almost incidental to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , Rocky . It is something more even than a thinking man 's Rocky . One takes from it subtler pleasures-the controlled ferocity of Ben Cross as Abrahams , for instance , and the gentle strength of Ian Charleson as Liddell . A word of praise , too , goes to a supporting cast that includes Sir John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson as a pair of congealed Cambridge dons , Nigel Davenport and Patrick Magee as Olympic committeemen respectively too smooth and too Blimpish . Like every element in this picture , the actors look right ; they seem to emerge from the past , instead of being pasted on to it , as so many characters in historical movies seem to be .
