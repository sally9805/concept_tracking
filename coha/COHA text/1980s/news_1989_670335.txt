R.J. Sands is a salsa junkie . As vice president of marketing for Pace Foods Inc. , a San Antonio , Texas , maker of the chunky , spicy sauce that usually accompanies Mexican food , Mr. Sands regularly samples all of the rival brands . If a salsa brings tears to his eyes and a glow to his stomach , he promptly ships some off for analysis to Lou Rasplicka , a Pace food chemist nicknamed Dr. Pepper . Mr. Sands ' s palate has been getting quite a workout lately . With more than 300 brands on the market , salsa has become one of the hottest specialty foods around . The market grew to nearly $320 million last year , up from about $175 million in 1984 , and overall sales are increasing at a healthy 16. 1% annual clip . Some industry analysts expect sales to hit $700 million in just three years , as salsa makers attract Anglo ketchup lovers and Hispanics who have traditionally concocted their own . " Mexican food has become a national phenomenon , " says Frank Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has transformed the salsa market into a hot war that ' s nowhere near stability . Competition only heats up . " One factor escalating the battle for shelf space is that big guns have moved into the market . Last summer , RJR Nabisco Inc. introduced hot , medium and mild salsas nationwide under the Ortega label . Frito-Lay Inc. looks on its own salsa as a major " stimulant " for selling its corn and potato chips , and now displays the product prominently alongside its chip racks . The PepsiCo Inc. subsidiary , which says its salsa sales are already 25% ahead of projections , recently finished test marketing a new chunky sauce in the Southwest and has begun pushing the product nationwide . Frito-Lay ' s powerful chip-and-salsa marketing muscle is already causing heartburn for industry leaders Old El Paso  --  made by Chicago-based Whitman Corp.  --  and Pace , each of which controls about 30% of the market . Both are now cajoling store managers to position their sauces close to chips . " In this business , you ' re always looking for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker . George A. Hormel &; Co. is also quickly making inroads into the market . Less than two years ago , the food giant launched its own brand by licensing the name of its Chi Chi ' s Mexican restaurants , a chain popular in the Midwest and Northeast . Hormel says it is trying to push its salsa  --  made in Manitowoc , Wis.  --  into the 25 markets where Chi Chi ' s has a loyal " gringo " following . The strategy includes printing Mexican-food recipes on the jars to help teach shoppers how to use the sauce . Last year , Hormel expanded its salsa distribution to 18 states from seven , and a company spokesman says salsa sales are increasing 25% annually . It remains to be seen , though , how Hormel will do in the Southwest and West , where Chi Chi ' s isn ' t widely known . With their huge advertising budgets , RJR , Frito-Lay and Hormel pose a significant threat to the hundreds of small and medium-size salsa makers , such as Ha Cha Cha , Hell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this market matures , " says SAMI ' s Mr. Smith , " there will be no room for mediocre sauce makers or companies with small budgets . " The bare-knuckles fight between Pace and La Victoria Foods , a small , privately owned company in City of Industry , Calif. , that has long dominated the West Coast market , illustrates what can happen in head-to-head competition against a much bigger rival . When Pace launched a major television advertising blitz on the West Coast last summer , La Victoria responded by increasing its ad budget fivefold and unveiling a batch of new salsas . But when the smoke cleared , a wounded La Victoria conceded defeat . " We don ' t have enough resources to engage fully in this battle , " says Russell N. Franks , vice president of marketing for La Victoria , which saw its market share in California shrink to about 36% from 46% . ( Pace ' s share there rose some eight points , to about 29% . ) Another of Pace ' s battles , with rival Old El Paso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days to guard their turf . In October 1987 , for instance , Pace filed a lawsuit against Old El Paso in federal court in San Antonio , claiming that Old El Paso had changed its jar design to resemble Pace ' s  --  causing many customers to confuse the two . The companies settled out of court in January 1988 , after Old El Paso agreed to change the bottle and label . Pace also launched a national television advertising broadside against its rival , featuring cowboys complaining that their Pace salsa had run out and that the only alternative was " made in New York City . " Executives at Old El Paso , which is actually based in St. Louis , sniff at such efforts by " the little regional company , " as they refer to Pace . As Pace and Old El Paso continue their fight , another rival has emerged  --  this time from south of the border . Herdez S.A. , one of Mexico ' s largest salsa makers , is seeking to capture the business of Hispanics in the U.S.  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently signed a distribution and marketing agreement with McCormick &; Co. , the Baltimore-based maker of food seasonings . Their immediate targets are recent immigrants from Mexico , who prefer their salsa extra hot  --  Herdez ' s specialty . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
