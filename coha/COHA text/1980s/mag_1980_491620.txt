NELLIE CONNALL ? WHATEVER HAPPENS , SHE 'LL WIN . The double front doors of the main house of the Connally Picosa Ranch in Floresville , Texas , do not have either a bell or a knocker to announce visitors . You rap on them with your knuckles . It is the morning after a Thanksgiving gathering of the Connally clan  --  cool and brisk , with a wind blowing clean across Texas for a bracer  --  and you hesitate a little to break the holiday spell . The lady who answers the tattoo on the door does not hesitate at all . She is fresh as a daisy and her radiant smile says it all : Welcome . Texas is proud of her and it is easy to see why immediately . Nellie Connally happens to be a grandmother ( there were 15 at the Thanksgiving family table , two in high chairs ) , but she also happens to have a kind of girlish vivacity about her which is irresistible . Nellie , who wants you to call her that , is dressed this morning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the skirt reaching to the top of high brown boots , undecorated but plainly elegant , and a broad leather belt sparkling with a pattern of coins from many lands . She wears a finely designed lapel pin which she explains is the " logo " of the Santa Gertrudis cattle they raise on the ranch , a jewel shaped in the head of a prize bull . My readers are far too polite to ask openly , but the question hovers out there in the atmosphere , and it deserves an answer : Yes , Nellie Connally has a smashingfigure . The whole ensemble ( ladies like to hear about these things ) leaves Nellie perfectly attired for a ramble around the ranch or polite conversation over a spot of tea . It turns out to be coffee , upstairs in John 's study , after we have waded through a passel of youngsters of all ages and Nellie has somehow managed to make introductions and keep us moving in zigzag patterns around happy clusters of humanity populating the huge living room with the cathedral ceiling . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clearly the family prefers the great room with its massive fireplace , black granitefloor and banks of paintings depicting the Southwest landscape the " Governor " so loves . We relax in the Governor 's study , and it is clear why he finds this a favorite place to relax and think and escape some of the hurry-schmurry which goes on around the rest of the big ranch house pretty much all of the time . As Nellie Connally sits there comfortably in a big chair , sipping her coffee and awaiting with utter sangfroid the inevitable silly questions which surface in such an interview , we really must pause for a moment to set this stage for you , now also a visitor . Floresville is John Connally 's birthplace and here he comes to relax , reflect , and renew his energies by the hard work attendant upon running a 9,000-acre ranch teeming with prize cattle , quarter horses and an assortment of dogs , headed by a rangy Rhodesian Ridgeback , which joyfully chases the visitor 's car in the hopes of finding him timid enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fling at one to keep him in his place as a stranger . Floresville is named after Francisco Flores de Abreyo , a Mexican cattle baron who established the first hacienda in the area . It is a town of 4,000 people , and every one of them seems to love living there and will tell you so at the drop of a 10-gallon hat . Its people are 50 percent Anglo-Saxon and 50 percent Latin . Some of the oldsters still call the Governor " Johnnie , " after the Continued on page 69 continued from page 67 years when he was a kid in patched pants running errands around town after he had finished the chores on the family 's small farm . He chats back with them in Spanish and English , mixing it up as the situation may require . The town has the look of a John Wayne western , with the sidewalks covered in front of many of the stores to protect the citizens from rain or sun which can come down on you in Texas-sized intensity . The natives all say " howdy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all southeast of San Antonio , which is surely one of the most beguiling cities in America , with its Spanish motifs and its Venice-like river . Then ten more miles out of Floresville along the Independence Trail , with identifying markers of a brawny arm brandishing a Winchester rifle , to get to the Connally spread , past other ranches set down in this rolling country of oak clusters , fields stretching to the horizon , eroded canyons , mesquite to clutch at you as you ride or walk through it , and cactus clinging to fences and adding wicked needles to the barbed wire . The Connally ranch house is maybe half a mile in from the main road along a dirt road which has a tendency to become a rock pile every so often , a no-kiddin ' kind of road . The Ridgeback and a mongrel buddy escort you to the house , where the eye catches a swimming pool , tennis court and guest house out back , a gigantic piece of rock sculpture out front which turns out to be a Nellie creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an itchy trigger finger . There 's no sign of the working acres of the ranch here except for the bulk of the enormous Santa Gertrudis cattle , bred by crossing the Brahman strain from India with the Texas Shorthorn ( they recently sold one bull at auction for $35,000 ) , lending their formidable shapes to the horizon . The main house sits amidst about 3,500 acres . And from the Governor 's study the land rolls out , green with the coastal Bermuda grass John Connally brought to this brown terrain of Texas and now sells to his neighbors . As far as the eye can see is his . His big desk in the middle of the study is the one he brought with him after his third term as Governor . Overhead is a magnificently antlered staghead . Underfoot is an even more superb trophy , a Tasmanian lion skin which captures the floor . The room is packed with memorabilia from the Governor 's world travels . Conveniently at hand is a clutch of beautifully tooled rifles in a vertical stand . John Connally has refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to , as a needless waste of the taxpayers ' money , so there are no lurking guardians to be seen . But you get the idea that the rifles will do the job , if needed . Big country . And there sits Nellie . High cheekbones . Gray-green eyes . " Like a cat 's , " she says . No make-up needed . Hair full and naturally curly . The first question is always the hardest . Best to start with the heart . Once upon a time the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Arno Brill of Austin , Texas , a girl by the name of Idanell Brill , attended the University of Texas at the same time as did a handsome young character from Floresville by the name of John Connally . " What was your dream at that time , Nellie ? " She laughs easily at herself . Continued on page 90 ceeded with her visit . " I would try in the first few minutes of conversation , " she recalls , " to give them an authoritative overview of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jimmy had already made three speeches on Latin America which I knew well . It became clear to them that the President was not brushing them off by a social visit from me . They could see that I was bringing them serious and friendly messages and they knew I would take back to Jimmy their ideas and report them acccurately . They gave me a really warm reception . We made some good friends and have stayed in touch . " Obviously , Rosalynn enjoys a great deal about her job . What has n't she liked ? " Living with all the security arrangements is hard , " she replies . " But our family had to get used to that when Jimmy was governor . Now we more or less take it for granted . We try to ignore the presence of secret service people who are around us , which , I am sure , is what they want . " Despite that and other constant reminders of their public position , and the responsibilities and restrictions that go with it , Rosalynn insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she sees it : " When we go upstairs to our family quarters in the White House , we are going into what we have tried to make into a home and where we can live as a family . We have our family meals together . Sometimes Amy brings a friend in from school . The boys and their families come and go . We look at television and read . Jimmy often settles down during an evening to read a book . He , of course , interests himself in what all the children are doing . He has always been a strong father , as his father was before him . I do n't know that he has ever spanked Amy , but she knows what he expects of her and she respects him . Firmness and love is what all children need , and we have tried to supply both . Aside from those hectic years when Jimmy was running for governor and was away so much and the burden of disciplining the children fell mostly on me , Jimmy has been a real father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connally continued from page 69 " The ordinary , " says Nellie . " I 'm afraid it was only as far as living in a vine-covered cottage surrounded by flowers with someone I loved dearly . " " Now you 're in a vine-covered ranch house , more or less . Things have n't changed that much , really . You met John when you were both members of an undergraduate theatre group . .. He 's a pretty handsome man today . What was he like then ? " That image must have flicked across her mind . Nellie has a very mobile face . Just now her expression reveals that she fell in love just about on sight , and she 's still unwaveringly in love with him . " He was something . We were both stage-struck . I think I had it in my mind that someday I might be a famous thespian . But things worked out differently , of course . " In addition to their mutual interest in the campus Curtain Club , John and Nellie were generally regarded as naturals for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students Association , elected after a runaway campaign , and she was idolized as the bearer of the title , " Sweetheart of the University . " Their love affair was idyllic . They were married on December 21 , 1940 . Their love affair is still idyllic . " John came from a farming background . How about yours ? You were Idanell Brill , were n't you ? Hence the ' Nellie ' ? " " Yes . My father was a leather merchant . He 's now passed away , but not very long ago . We have a wonderful remembrance of him . Among the things he made were the holsters for the Texas Rangers . And here was this auction advertising that they had one of the famous ' Brill ' holsters for sale ! John got right on the phone and it was ours . " Nellie looks so happy at the thought that the next question is obvious . " Family means a lot to you , does n't it ? " " More than that . It means everything to me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * All that time I have seen as my duty to back him up as wife and mother and to keep the family behind him so that he can be at his very best at all times . That has been my contribution to his career as I have seen it . " ( It is interesting to note that in another conversation with Mark M. Connally , their 27-year-old son , now president of the First City National Bank in Floresville , Mark reflected that at no time did he and his brother and little sister feel that his father 's busy public life ever stood in the way of John Connally 's devotion to his family . " Mom and Dad were always there , every time , when we needed them . They never once let us down , " says Mark . He seems to rank that among his father 's greatest accomplishments and , when you think of it , he 's right . ) Thinking about this family angle , Nellie laughs merrily at a conversation she had with a lady journalist when John was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support her husband by keeping him happy and loved rather than by inching into his political affairs , this reporter asked : " How can you stand being ' just the governor 's wife ' and having no identity of your own ? " " My answer to that , " says Nellie , eyes flashing , " is that being identified as Governor Connally 's wife is the greatest thing that could happen to me in my entire life . " The chitchat moves easily from there to the religious life of the Connallys . " We are Methodists , and we believe in God and have brought up our children to do the same , " Nellie says . She has an affinity for the literal truth , it seems . " You wo n't see us in the very front pew every Sunday these days , perhaps . But our hearts and thoughts are there just the same . " By now , the subject comes around to the main topic  --  politics . I phrase it as gently as possible . " If Governor Connally were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , and then went on to become elected as president of the United States , how do you think you would enjoy the view from Harry Truman 's balcony porch on the White House ? " Nellie 's eyes twinkle . " When he wins the nomination and when he wins the election . . . . " she corrects the question . Her smile takes all of the edge away from the quip . Bravo . That 's the spirit . " Seriously , " Nellie goes on , " my husband has never gone into anything without the expectation of winning . He won every time he ran for office , but he 's also been appointed to most of his positions on the basis of his abilities rather than on his popularity . He and I have talked over this coming election in all of its phases , and I can assure you that if John could feel in his heart that there were a candidate in either party more fitted than he for the presidency and could serve the nation better , both of us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it just does n't seem to be the case . Continued on following page My husband has always been guided by this strong sense of duty . As you know , he 's not at all the typical oil-rich Texan . He started as a poor farm boy and all the money has been made through his work as a lawyer and in raising cattle . It has n't been that easy for him , as some people may think . " Nellie 's mood becomes sombre . Without any doubt the shadow of that terrible day in Dallas has fallen across her thoughts . It was then that she and her husband were sitting in the jump seats of the presidential limousine when the murderous gunfire broke out , aimed at President John F. Kennedy , sitting with his wife Jackie in the back seat of the car . We remember what happened then . But only Nellie knows the searing experience of seeing a bullet crash into the right side of John 's back , blast a way through his innards , emerge from his chest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue on through his wrist and into his leg . The fact is , that day Nellie saved her husband 's life . She pulled him over in her lap and leaned over him " to keep them from hurting him any more . " By God 's good grace , as she did this , his right arm was folded against his body and forcibly covered the gaping wound in his chest , stanching the flow of blood . Otherwise , he would have died during the 100-milean-hour race to the hospital . As it was , both Nellie and Jackie sat in the waiting room while both the President and the Governor underwent emergency surgery in a desperate attempt to save their lives . As we know , only John Connally survived , and that was chiefly due to Nellie 's using her body to shield him . His last words in that terrible moment were not of himself but of her . " Someone take care of Nellie , " said John Connally , as he lapsed into the dark of unconsciousness . It was a trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived that awful , historic moment , both Nellie and John may well feel that the rest of his life is his on velvet , a gift of the gods , as it were , and perhaps part of a destiny which is preordained to take him to the White House . Whatever , it has not changed Nellie one iota . Friends have been quoted as saying that she has a marvelous sense of knowing when she should participate in his life and when not to , and always does the right thing even when that consists of doing precisely nothing . They always talk out his major decisions , but Nellie always keeps her voice low . " She provides an added dimension to his life which has meant a great deal to him , " says Connally 's friend Robert Strauss . Today , gazing out over the rolling Picosa fields , Nellie muses : " I know very well that if I really insisted upon it , and asked John not to run for the presidency , he probably would withdraw . But we both feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up for what he believes in and stated where he stands , and then let the cards and votes fall where they may . If he loses  --  and , as I said , he never has  --  he 's perfectly prepared to lose on his honest beliefs . " We sit silently for a moment . " John may become president . Or , if not , he will have more time for himself and his family . Either way , whatever happens , I win . " There is an aura of quiet serenity about her as Nellie says this . She has a strong philosophy to carry her through . " I never look back . I concern myself with the present , and even more with the future . So does John . His obligation in running for top office is a deep-seated concern for the future ; he wants to do what he can to make things better for the generation to come . " She has been holding her coffee cup in strong , steady hands . Now , she takes a final sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of her to me . " My mother is a great lady , " She will be happy to know that he said that . And he was right . A
