After eight months , the Kremlin faces a no-win dilemma <P> Celebrating the end of the month-long Ramadan fast , President Babrak Karmal appeared at Kabul 's Salam Khana Palace mosque last week and delivered some words of warning to his fellow Afghans . " Brothers and sisters , foreign powers want to exploit your Islamic sentiments , " he declared . " They send their agents , mercenaries and other bought servants to kill your men , women and children ; to blow up your schools , mosques and hospitals , and to burn your wheat stocks , houses , shops and commodities . " <P> Karmal 's speech was the most forthright public admission so far that all is not well under the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . In fact , the insurgency by fierce Muslim mujahidin ( holy warriors ) is not only going strong but in some parts of the country has spread and intensified . Eight months after their Christmas invasion , the Soviets have still not been able to gain control over much of the rugged countryside . Despite the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a humiliating military deadlock . Says former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Robert Neumann : " On the one hand , the Soviets can hang on for as long as they want . On the other hand , they ca n't win . The people of Afghanistan are not going to let them win . " At week 's end a high-ranking team of Soviet experts had arrived in Kabul for what diplomats said was to be a major review of the bogged-down war effort . <P> Recent visitors to Kabul report an un easy siege atmosphere . After months of trying to keep a low profile , Soviet armored personnel carriers have reappeared at street corners and in front of public buildings . The city 's outskirts are ringed with Soviet heavy armor . After dark , Kabul police stop all taxis for thorough identification and weapons searches . Reason for the precautions : Soviet fears about Afghan army mutinies , guerrilla infiltrators and even possible rebel attacks on the capital . <P> Hit-and-run raids by bands of insurgents have become bigger and bolder . Radio Kabul described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subversive elements " near Kholm , northwest of the capital . Clashes have also been reported in Ghazni , Lowgar and Vardak provinces , which lie southwest of Kabul . The village of Mohammad Za'i , just six miles south of the capital , has been the scene of two successive mujahidin assaults . First the rebels set fire to the local hospital and school ; a few weeks later they returned and blew up the power station . The Soviets hit back with a series of aerial strikes by MiG-21s and Mi-24 helicopter gunships , which have become their most successful anti-insurgency weapon . <P> The Soviets have suffered their worst setback in Herat ( pop . 160,000 ) , an ancient trading center at the western edge of the country . There the government 's control has all but collapsed , and much of the city has turned into a lawless no man 's land . Bands of armed rebels fight Afghan troops day and night . Bandits roam freely , robbing people of money and food at gunpoint . One of the city 's well-known medical facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , including foreign physicians , was evacuated to Kabul . Soviet forces have stayed outside the city , apparently for fear of becoming embroiled in a major , costly battle .
