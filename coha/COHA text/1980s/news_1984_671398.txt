The strip of land in northwest Nicaragua , which includes the provinces of Chinandega and Leon , is one of the most fertile in Central America . For years , it produced enormous and succulent citrus fruit in haphazardly tended groves ; generations of Nicaraguan children grew up considering Chinandega oranges the most sublime of treats. // But during the long rule of the Somoza family , dramatic changes overtook the region that Nicarauans call " the west . " Wealthy planters , attracted by the legendary richness of the soil , opened vast plantations to grow export crops , and cotton was most important of all . Many small landowners were driven out , sometimes with the cooperation of the national guard. // Cotton is now second only to coffee as a source of desperately needed foreign exchange for Nicaragua . <> <> Trailers Are Ready to Go // // On a large field near the Pan American Highway , more than a hundred long red trailers are parked . Soon , traffic on the two-lane road will be slowed to a crawl by these trailers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depots to the Pacific port of Corinto. // There , the cotton will be loaded aboard freighters , many of them bound for Japan . " We consider Nicaraguan cotton to be very high quality , " a Japanese diplomat here said. // Local road crews are fighting a losing battle against the elements , and parts of the highway resemble the lunar surface . Some repairs are being made in an effort to minimize damage to trailers and other vehicles that will carry the cotton , but the Government anounced several months ago that lack of dollars would mean that only 20 percent of needed road work would be performed . Nicaragua can not afford to buy enough of the petroleum that is used to make asphalt. // // // Unlike most parts of Nicaragua , there has been little fighting in this area . Military convoys pass regularly on their way to the Honduran border area , where the army has been battling United States-backed insurgents , but most residents know of the war principally through news accounts . Only in Managua does the armed conflict that has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distant. // But if the fighting is far away , life in Chinandega is not as it once was. // Jose Martinez used to sell American-grown apples and grapes on a street corner near a movie theater here . Now that Nicaragua no longer imports fruit , Mr. Martinez has been forced to find a new business. // He is not complaining , however . He now operates a lending library from a pushcart parked where his fruit stall once stood . For three cordobas , or about 10 cents , anyone can bring a book or comic and exchange it for another. // " People like to read , especially romances , " Mr. Martinez said . " I ' m doing well . Once I was thin , now I ' m getting fat. " // At a more substantial shop a few blocks away , Maria Antonia de Soto Mayor sells hand-made wicker rocking chairs so soothing and comfortable that they are sometimes blamed for reducing ambition by inducing excessive torpor . The chairs , along with matching tables , are made of domestically grown jute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. De Soto Mayor regularly goes to Masatepe , 100 miles southeast of here , to oversee a cooperative that produces the furniture. // " This is an art form and needs to be appreciated that way , " she said between customers . " The finest pieces can only be made by hand. " // // // In many parts of Nicaragua , Cuban advisers have taken up residence and , on some occasions , have been the object of local conflicts. // In Chinandega , however , not Cubans but Russians have established a presence , and residents appear genuinely grateful to them , if puzzled by their clannish behavior - and the fact that some of the Russians do not speak Spanish. // In the spring of 1982 , this region was devastated by floods , and the Government appealed for foreign help . The Soviet Union , which was already providing Nicaragua with military and economic assistance , responded by sending a team of doctors and nurses , who opened a temporary medical center for victims and their families . The center was so well received that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 100 , 000 patients free of charge in two and a half years. // Since the Sandinista takeover five years ago , mass inoculation campaigns and the establishment of rudimentary public health standards have substantially improved the quality of preventive medicine . But at the same time , curative medicine has deteriorated because many doctors have fled the country and medicine is in short supply. // But at the Soviet-Nicaraguan Friendship Hospital in Chinandega , there is no shortage of medicine or skilled professionals . Nicaraguan health officials say treatment here may be better than at any other civilian hospital in the country. // <> <> Hospital Is Well Equipped // // At the Soviet hospital , as everyone calls it , all who arrive are treated , and with none of the deadening bureaucracy that afflicts Nicaragua ' s public health system . Medicine is plentiful because it comes specially earmarked from the Soviet Red Cross , and doctors are trained to a level beyond the reach of most Nicaraguans . Services range from pediatrics to dentistry to treatment of malaria and dysentery. // // Aleksandr Litkov , deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hospital in Moscow . He is nearing the end of his one-year tour here , for which he said he had volunteered. // " We do this to help the people of Nicaragua , " Dr. Litkov said . He does not speak Spanish , and he said through a translator that the 40 Russian doctors and nurses here sometimes had trouble adjusting to the change from Moscow to Chinandega. // " The climate , " he said , " is perhaps the hardest adaptation. " // //
