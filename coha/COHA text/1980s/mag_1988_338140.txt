RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER : BY TRAIN THROUGH CHINA <P> by Paul Theroux <P> Putnam ; 480 pages ; $21.95 <P> " Grin like a dog and wander aimlessly . " This gnomic advice for the wayfarer is offered by the world 's pre-eminent train traveler in his wry , humorful and occasionally querulous account of a journey across China by rail . ( The Iron Rooster of the title , locally known as the cheapskate express , is the train from Beijing to Urumqi . ) As Theroux makes excruciatingly clear , traveling alone in the Middle Kingdom is not for the faint of heart or stomach : the food is mostly vile , the toilets are filthy , and drafty coaches are invariably crowded with unbathed passengers who yammer and spit . <P> But there are surprises . The author of such chronicles of nomadism as The Great Railway Bazaar and The Old Patagonian Express has an uncanny eye for telling details and bizarre statistics  --  for example , 35 million Chinese still live in caves . Theroux finds a kind of Nirvana at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by auto , not rail . He is overwhelmed by the indomitable verve of the Tibetans , who have kept alive their culture and loyalty to the exiled Dalai Lama despite the methodical savagery of Beijing 's rule . And why is Tibet such a paradise ? This remote land of monks and mountains , Theroux notes , is the only area of China without trains . " I thought I liked railways until I saw Tibet , " he surprisingly concludes , " and then I realized that I liked wilderness much more . " <P> THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH <P> by Michael Chabon <P> Morrow ; 297 pages ; $16.95 <P> Early in this bright , funny , mannered first novel , Art Bechstein , the heterosexual hero , fresh out of college and understandably eager to postpone adulthood by whatever means necessary , talks himself into a summer of deviant fiddledeedee . " It was not as though I had any firm or fearful objection to homosexuals , " he reflects when one makes an advance . " In certain books by gay writers I thought I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . It was only that I felt keen to avoid , as they say , a misunderstanding . " Ah , yes . So Art wobbles rubber-legged between Phlox , a beautiful but shallow young woman , and Arthur , a beautiful young man of fascinating secret sorrows . The pages bounce along amusingly , although a subplot involving Bechstein 's father , supposedly a big-shot gangster , never makes much sense . A heterosexual reader may experience a " gack " reaction when Art reaches tenderly for the wrong sort of flesh , but that does no harm . The book 's major flaw is that occasional paragraphs are too self-indulgently exquisite , as if the author had written them while wearing yellow spats . <P> THE SALAD DAYS <P> by Douglas Fairbanks Jr . <P> Doubleday ; 431 pages ; $19.95
